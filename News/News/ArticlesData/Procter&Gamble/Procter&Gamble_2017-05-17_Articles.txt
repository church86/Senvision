The company known for its polo shirts and pony logo said Wednesday that Louvet will start in July. He will replace Stefan Larsson, who announced in February that he would leave the New York-based company after less than two years in the job. Larsson was the first person other than company founder Ralph Lauren to hold the title. The two clashed over creative control, though Lauren said the decision to part was mutual. In the announcement about Louvet, Lauren cited his collaborative working style. "Finding the right partner to work with me to take us forward in our evolution has been my primary focus over the last several months," Lauren said. Like other retailers, Ralph Lauren's revenue has been hurt as more shoppers skip department stores and choose to shop online. Last month, the company closed its high-profile Polo store on New York's Fifth Avenue and said it may close other stores, cut jobs and shutdown some corporate offices. Louvet was most recently president of Procter & Gamble's beauty brands, which includes Pantene shampoo and Olay anti-wrinkle cream. He will report to Lauren, who is the company's executive chairman of the board and chief creative officer. Shares of Ralph Lauren slipped $1.19 to close Wednesday at $72.75. They are down 19 percent so far this year. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

The company known for its polo shirts and pony logo said Wednesday that Louvet will start in July. He will replace Stefan Larsson, who announced in February that he would leave the New York-based company after less than two years in the job. Larsson was the first person other than company founder Ralph Lauren to hold the title. The two clashed over creative control, though Lauren said the decision to part was mutual. In the announcement about Louvet, Lauren cited his collaborative working style. "Finding the right partner to work with me to take us forward in our evolution has been my primary focus over the last several months," Lauren said. Like other retailers, Ralph Lauren's revenue has been hurt as more shoppers skip department stores and choose to shop online. Last month, the company closed its high-profile Polo store on New York's Fifth Avenue and said it may close other stores, cut jobs and shutdown some corporate offices. Louvet was most recently president of Procter & Gamble's beauty brands, which includes Pantene shampoo and Olay anti-wrinkle cream. He will report to Lauren, who is the company's executive chairman of the board and chief creative officer. Shares of Ralph Lauren slipped $1.19 to close Wednesday at $72.75. They are down 19 percent so far this year. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

Louvet, 52, most recently group president of global beauty at Procter & Gamble, will answer directly to 77-year-old Ralph Lauren, who remains executive chairman and chief creative officer, as well as to the company's board of directors. Louvet will take up his position as president and chief executive officer on July 17, the fashion company announced from its New York headquarters. Louvet comes to the iconic US label with more than 25 years experience at P&G, including a stint as president of its global prestige business where he oversaw a diverse portfolio of 23 fashion brands, including Gucci and Hugo Boss. "Finding the right partner to work with me to take us forward in our evolution has been my primary focus over the last several months and I am thrilled that Patrice is joining our talented team," said Lauren. The veteran designer said Louvet's business skills, combined "with his collaborative working style, transformation experience and intense focus on results, will put us in a stronger position as we move toward the future." "The brand holds tremendous potential around the world and I could not be more excited to lead the next phase of development for this great company with Ralph and the team," said Louvet. Ralph Lauren is to release its fourth quarter earnings on Thursday. The fashion house announced February 2 that chief executive Stefan Larsson was stepping down after little over a year, following disagreements with Lauren over how to position the clothing line in the fast-changing retail universe. In April, the corporation announced plans to move into a more cost-effective, flexible e-commerce platform, closing its flagship Polo store on New York's Fifth Avenue and streamlining the organization to save $140 million in annual expenses. © 2017 AFP 0 Comments To This Article Leave a Reply Dating Currency Zone Health Quotes Expat Deals Moving Quotes Most Read Cambodia jails Frenchman for 7 years for...

Giovanni Giannoni/Fairchild. Ralph Lauren Corp. is taking another stab at having someone other than its founder and longtime leader run the organization. The company said today that it has named Procter & Gamble veteran Patrice Louvet president and CEO, effective July 17, 2017. He will also be appointed to the firm’s board of directors. Related After Making a Big Splash, Why See-Now, Buy-Now Collections May Be Drowning The announcement comes just three months after the company said that Stefan Larsson — the first president and CEO to succeed Lauren — was exiting the firm due to creative differences with its founder. As was the case with Larsson’s arrival, Lauren will continue as executive chairman and chief creative officer. Louvet will dual-report to Lauren in his capacity as executive chairman of the board and to the company’s board of directors. Louvet most recently served as group president of global beauty at P&G, a division of 12 brands with around $11.5 billion in revenues in 2016. “Finding the right partner to work with me to take us forward in our evolution has been my primary focus over the last several months, and I am thrilled that Patrice is joining our talented team,” Lauren said in a release. “He’s an enormously skilled business leader with a deep passion for the consumer and a sophisticated understanding of building global brands.” Lauren suggested in February that creative differences were mostly responsible for the short tenure of Larsson. After making a grand entrance to the firm in November 2015, Larsson — who headed up a robust turnaround as former global president of Old Navy — announced his May 1 departure in February. “Stefan and I share a love and respect for the DNA of this great brand, and we both recognize the need to evolve,” Lauren said at that time. “However, we have found that we have different views on how to evolve the creative and consumer-facing parts of the business.” Lauren added that “many conversations with one another, and our board of directors,” led to a mutual decision to part ways but acknowledged that Larsson set the firm in “the right direction with the Way Forward Plan.” Incoming president and CEO Louvet spent 25 years at P&G. Among his prior roles at the firm were president of Global Prestige business and several management and leadership posts in Europe, Asia and North America. “Ralph is one of the world’s greatest fashion icons and someone I have admired for many years, and it’s an incredible opportunity to partner with him to continue to build on 50 years of heritage and innovation,” Louvet said in a statement today. “The brand holds tremendous potential around the world, and I could not be more excited to lead the next phase of development for this great company with Ralph and the team.” Ralph Lauren is expected to release fourth-quarter earnings results before the market open on Thursday. As of 11:10 a.m. ET, the company’s shares were down 1 percent, to $73.21. — Sign up for the FN Newsletter — Business, Executive Moves, Asia Pacific, Europe, North America, Ralph Lauren, Stefan Larsson Share This Article Reddit LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Print Talk Post navigation ← Stephen Curry Leads Throttling of San Antonio Spurs in an Under Armour Curry 3Zer0 PE Industry Moves: Ralph Lauren Has New CEO, Columbia President Steps Down & More → Featured Gallery Celebrity Statement Shoes: May 2017 ALERTS & NEWSLETTERS SIGN UP PRIVACY POLICY Around The Web Latest Publication Footwear News 05/08/2017 Read Now Cannes: Myriad Pictures Boards Zosia Mamet, Scott Speedman's… Chicago P.D.

The company known for its polo shirts and pony logo said Wednesday that Louvet will start in July. He will replace Stefan Larsson, who announced in February that he would leave the New York-based company after less than two years in the job. Larsson was the first person other than company founder Ralph Lauren to hold the title. The two clashed over creative control, though Lauren said the decision to part was mutual. In the announcement about Louvet, Lauren cited his collaborative working style. "Finding the right partner to work with me to take us forward in our evolution has been my primary focus over the last several months," Lauren said. Like other retailers, Ralph Lauren's revenue has been hurt as more shoppers skip department stores and choose to shop online. Last month, the company closed its high-profile Polo store on New York's Fifth Avenue and said it may close other stores, cut jobs and shutdown some corporate offices. Louvet was most recently president of Procter & Gamble's beauty brands, which includes Pantene shampoo and Olay anti-wrinkle cream. He will report to Lauren, who is the company's executive chairman of the board and chief creative officer. Shares of Ralph Lauren slipped $1.19 to close Wednesday at $72.75. They are down 19 percent so far this year. This photo provided by Ralph Lauren shows new company CEO Patrice Louvet.

The factors that could cause actual results to materially differ include, among others: the loss of key personnel, including Mr. Ralph Lauren, or other changes in our executive and senior management team or to our operating structure, and our ability to effectively transfer knowledge during periods of transition; the potential impact to our business and future strategic direction resulting from our transition to a new Chief Executive Officer; our ability to successfully implement our long-term growth strategy, which entails evolving our product, marketing, and shopping experience to increase desirability and relevance, and evolving our operating model to enable sustainable, profitable sales growth by significantly reducing supply chain lead times, improving our sourcing, and executing a disciplined multi-channel distribution and expansion strategy; the impact to our business resulting from investments and other costs incurred in connection with the execution of our long-term growth strategy, including restructuring-related charges, which may be dilutive to our earnings in the short term;

our ability to secure our facilities and systems and those of our third-party service providers from, among other things, cybersecurity breaches, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, or similar Internet or email events; a variety of legal, regulatory, tax, political, and economic risks, including risks related to the importation and exportation of products, tariffs, and other trade barriers which our operations are currently subject to, or may become subject to as a result of potential changes in legislation, and other risks associated with our international operations, such as compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or violations of other anti-bribery and corruption laws prohibiting improper payments, and the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws and regulations, including tax laws, trade and labor restrictions, and related laws that may reduce the flexibility of our business;

changes in our tax obligations and effective tax rates due to a variety of factors, including potential changes in tax laws and regulations, accounting rules, or the mix and level of earnings by jurisdiction; our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations from both a transactional and translational perspective; the impact to our business resulting from increases in the costs of raw materials, transportation, and labor; the impact to our business resulting from changes in consumers’ ability or preferences to purchase premium lifestyle products that we offer for sale and our ability to forecast consumer demand, which could result in either a build-up or shortage of inventory; our ability to continue to maintain our brand image and reputation and protect our trademarks; the impact of the volatile state of the global economy, stock markets, and other global economic conditions on us, our customers, our suppliers, and our vendors and on our ability and their ability to access sources of liquidity;

the impact to our business of events of unrest and instability that are currently taking place in certain parts of the world, as well as from any terrorist action, retaliation, and the threat of further action or retaliation;

our ability to open new retail stores, concession shops, and e-commerce sites in an effort to expand our direct-to-consumer presence; the potential impact to the trading prices of our securities if our Class A common stock share repurchase activity and/or cash dividend payments differ from investors’ expectations; our ability to maintain our credit profile and ratings within the financial community; our ability to make certain strategic acquisitions and successfully integrate the acquired businesses into our existing operations;

Ralph Lauren tapped a beauty executive to lead his company after his previous chief executive left earlier this month. Patrice Louvet, a Procter & Gamble veteran who had most recently headed up that company’s global beauty business, was named chief executive and president of Ralph Lauren, the company said Wednesday. Louvet will assume his new position on July 17. “Finding the right partner to work with me to take us forward in our evolution has been my primary focus,” Lauren, 77, who will continue in his role as executive chairman and chief creative officer, said in a statement. It’s not unusual for a brand under financial pressure to bring in an outsider, said Marshal Cohen, chief industry analyst at the NPD Group. However, it’s possible Ralph Lauren is positioning itself to be bought, Cohen noted. Stefan Larsson, a fast-fashion veteran, stepped down as CEO. Ralph Lauren shares dipped 1.6 percent on Wednesday, to $72.75.

Stock pickers in general have had a rough year, underperforming the S&P 500 by about 4 percentage points. Jeff Cox | @JeffCoxCNBCcom 11 Hours AgoCNBC.com SHARES show chapters Hedge funds bet on tech    Tuesday, 16 May 2017 | 5:00 PM ET | 03:37 Hedge fund managers' most popular stock to start the year has been a familiar name that is falling short in terms of performance, while the least popular companies all have been crushing the market. Procter & Gamble pulled in nearly $2.7 billion in hedge fund cash during the first quarter, nearly double the next most popular stock, according to figures released this week from S&P Global Market Intelligence. Nelson Peltz's Trian Management was solely responsible for the gush of interest thanks to the $3.5 billion stake it took in the company back in February. Otherwise, P&G actually saw outflows. The huge flows came even though the company has fallen short compared with the broader market. P&G shares are up just 2.9 percent year to date. The stock did outperform in the first quarter, gaining 6.4 percent to the S&P 500's 4.6 percent, but has fallen off lately. Shares also outperformed the broader consumer staples sector in Q1 but have fallen behind in that regard as well. Daniel Acker | Bloomberg | Getty Images Procter & Gamble Tide brand detergent Other hedge fund favorites during the first quarter were Praxair and Marriott International ($1.4 billion each combined in increases and new positions), both of which have been stellar performers, as well as Constellation Brands ($859 million) and Formula One ($765 million). Among the stocks that had fallen the most out of favor in terms of outflows, the top two are head-scratchers: Microsoft and Amazon, which have seen declines in hedge fund investments of $1.6 billion apiece. The former is up more than 9 percent year to date, easily beating the market, while Amazon has roared more than 23 percent higher. Other big exits came from Autodesk (-$913 million), Safran (-$898 million) and Charter Communications (-$732 million). Each company has beaten the S&P 500 easily this year. Hedge funds broadly this year are up 3.1 percent, as gauged by the HFRI Fund Weighted Composite Index. That compares with the 7.2 percent total return for the S&P 500 through April. Due to Peltz's P&G investment, the first quarter was stellar for consumer staples, which easily outdistanced the other S&P 500 sectors.

Louvet, 52, most recently group president of global beauty at Procter & Gamble, will answer directly to 77-year-old Ralph Lauren, who remains executive chairman and chief creative officer, as well as to the company's board of directors. Louvet will take up his position as president and chief executive officer on July 17, the fashion company announced from its New York headquarters. Louvet comes to the iconic US label with more than 25 years experience at P&G, including a stint as president of its global prestige business where he oversaw a diverse portfolio of 23 fashion brands, including Gucci and Hugo Boss. "Finding the right partner to work with me to take us forward in our evolution has been my primary focus over the last several months and I am thrilled that Patrice is joining our talented team," said Lauren. The veteran designer said Louvet's business skills, combined "with his collaborative working style, transformation experience and intense focus on results, will put us in a stronger position as we move toward the future." "The brand holds tremendous potential around the world and I could not be more excited to lead the next phase of development for this great company with Ralph and the team," said Louvet. Ralph Lauren is to release its fourth quarter earnings on Thursday. The fashion house announced February 2 that chief executive Stefan Larsson was stepping down after little over a year, following disagreements with Lauren over how to position the clothing line in the fast-changing retail universe. In April, the corporation announced plans to move into a more cost-effective, flexible e-commerce platform, closing its flagship Polo store on New York's Fifth Avenue and streamlining the organization to save $140 million in annual expenses. 17 May 2017 Previous Back to summary Next Newsletter AFP Subscribe to our newsletter AFP's worldwide network The global network of Agence France Presse covers 150 countries Find out more Find out more Contact us If you have news to share or a question, comment or suggestion, contact us via...

Ralph Lauren Gambles On New CEO With Background In Beauty (And Laundry) Products Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Ralph Lauren Gambles On New CEO With Background In Beauty (And Laundry) Products Image courtesy of Ryan J. Quick May 17, 2017 2:11 pm EDT By Mary Beth Quirk@marybethquirk meet the new guy ralph lauren retail retailers apparel clothing shopping After the last CEO of Ralph Lauren (the clothing company) butted heads with Ralph Lauren (the man) and made a quick exit in February, the company has announced it’s taking a slightly different tack by hiring a new top executive without prior experience in the apparel business. The new CEO, Patrice Louvet, replaces short-tenured top exec Stefan Larsson, who joined Ralph Lauren in 2015 after jumping ship from Old Navy. Unlike Larsson, Louvet comes to the preppy fashion brand not from another clothing company or apparel retailer, but after more than 25 years at Procter & Gamble — a company mostly familiar for brands like Tide, Pampers, and NyQuil. However, he most recently ran P&G’s global beauty business, which includes fragrances for fashion brands like Hugo Boss, Dolce & Gabbana, and Gucci. That lack of clothing experience doesn’t seem to bother company founder Ralph Lauren, who stressed the importance of “finding the right partner” for him to work with. “He’s an enormously skilled business leader with a deep passion for the consumer and a sophisticated understanding of building global brands,” Lauren said. “This, combined with his collaborative working style, transformation experience and intense focus on results, will put us in a stronger position as we move toward the future.” Wall Street doesn’t appear convinced quite yet at the unusual choice, notes Bloomberg, with shares falling to their lowest level since July 2010 in trading on Wednesday. This lackluster response might mean that “investors expected someone with a slightly different professional background, and more meaningful track record in apparel and the fashion industry,” Chen Grazutis, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence said, but “that doesn’t mean he can’t be very successful in this role.” Ralph Lauren could use whatever help it can get: The company recently announced it would be closing stores — including its flagship Polo location in New York City — and cutting jobs as it tries to turn things around amid declining foot traffic and sluggish sales.

Patrice Louvet, who most recently oversaw Procter & Gamble's (pg) global beauty business, will become CEO on July 17. His appointment follows the abrupt ousting of retail superstar Stefan Larsson after less than 15 months in the role after clashes with founder Ralph Lauren and the board of directors over how to restore the company to its former glory. The departure of Larsson, a well regarded executive who had turned Gap Inc's (gps) Old Navy into a juggernaut after an enormously successful stint at H&M, was seen by investors as a setback in fixing a business whose brand was damaged by heavy discounting and whose sales were hurt by too much reliance on department stores and poor e-commerce execution. Larsson was the first CEO of Ralph Lauren other than the 77-year-old designer himself, who founded the company 50 years ago and now serves as chief creative officer. Part of his appeal was his success at those nimbler retailers at a time when Ralph Lauren has been trying to adjust to the rise of fast fashion. Incoming Ralph Lauren CEO Patrice Louvet Lauren, hinting that he was looking for less drama in a new CEO, praised Louvet’s "collaborative working style" in a press release. "Finding the right partner to work with me to take us forward in our evolution has been my primary focus over the last several months," he said. The company is pursuing a turnaround effort it calls "Way Forward" that has involved deep cost cuts in the hundreds of millions, the closing of 50 stores (including its Fifth Avenue Polo flagship), the elimination of hundreds of jobs, and a management shakeup. Ralph Lauren has also said it would streamline its offerings and speed production. Louvet is a 25-year veteran of P&G, the world’s largest consumer-products maker. He most recently ran the company's $11.5 billion global beauty business that was sold last year to Coty (coty) for $12.5 billion. Louvet had earlier overseen P&G’s Gillette lineup. His brand expertise will likely serve him well, as Ralph Lauren sets about more clearly delineating its products from the surfeit of apparel in a market that has turned clothing into a commodity struggling to command higher prices. Ralph Lauren's products have become fixtures at discount chains like TJX Cos' (tjx) T.J. Maxx. Even though Louvet has no direct apparel experience, Ralph Lauren is betting that his P&G experience, which included overseeing the branded beauty products for such names as Gucci and Hugo Boss, will give him insights into the fashion and luxury worlds.

The shares rose 3.4% to just over US$74, but chief executive officer Ian Cook would be US$100 a share, according to reports, which would value the company at a wallet-busting US$88bn. The New York Post reported that Cook named his price at a recent meeting with institutional investors. The newspaper reports that Anglo-Dutch rival Unilever plc (LON:ULVR) – itself a target of Kraft Heinz Co (NASDAQ:KHC) a few months back – could be interested in swallowing the New York-based conglomerate.

The company known for its polo shirts and pony logo said Wednesday that Louvet will start in July. He will replace Stefan Larsson, who announced in February that he would leave the New York-based company after less than two years in the job. Larsson was the first person other than company founder Ralph Lauren to hold the title. The two clashed over creative control, though Lauren said the decision to part was mutual. In the announcement about Louvet, Lauren cited his collaborative working style. Download our Expert Edition e-book, Cyber: Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation. Advertisement “Finding the right partner to work with me to take us forward in our evolution has been my primary focus over the last several months,” Lauren said. Like other retailers, Ralph Lauren’s revenue has been hurt as more shoppers skip department stores and choose to shop online. Last month, the company closed its high-profile Polo store on New York’s Fifth Avenue and said it may close other stores, cut jobs and shutdown some corporate offices. Louvet was most recently president of Procter & Gamble’s beauty brands, which includes Pantene shampoo and Olay anti-wrinkle cream. He will report to Lauren, who is the company’s executive chairman of the board and chief creative officer. Shares of Ralph Lauren slipped $1.19 to close Wednesday at $72.75. They are down 19 percent so far this year.

Meanwhile, the United Nations (UN) has revised downward India's GDP growth forecast for 2017 in its mid- 2017 report launched yesterday, 16 May 2017. India is projected to achieve a 7.3% growth in 2017, a downward revision from the 7.7% forecast for the year made when the report was launched in January. The revised report, however, projected that India will achieve 7.9% GDP growth in 2018, revising upwards its January estimates when it had said India's growth will be 7.6% next year. Despite temporary disruptions from the demonetisation policy, economic conditions in India remain robust, underpinned by sound fiscal and monetary policies and the implementation of key domestic reforms. Yet, stressed balance sheets in the banking and corporate sectors will prevent a strong investment rebound in the near term, the report said. Overseas, European stocks and Asian stocks were trading lower amid political and legal turmoil surrounding US President Donald Trump. Japan's core machinery orders fell short of expectations in March from the previous month. Core orders, regarded as a leading indicator of capital spending in the coming six to nine months, rose 1.4% in March from the previous month. In US, the tech-heavy Nasdaq closed at a record for a second session in a row yesterday, 16 May 2017 as the Dow industrials and S&P 500 finished fractionally lower amid political uncertainty in the US. Fresh reports emerged of President Donald Trump's interference in the Federal Bureau of Investigation's probe around his former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn.

The revised report, however, projected that India will achieve 7.9% GDP growth in 2018, revising upwards its January estimates when it had said India's growth will be 7.6% next year.

Keep me logged in I forgot my password No Thanks Equity Markets U.S. stocks opened sharply lower on Wednesday after reports of a leaked memo by former FBI chief James Comey caused alarm on Capitol Hill, raising questions about whether President Donald Trump tried to interfere with a federal investigation. Mr. Trump asked Mr. Comey to end a probe into former national security adviser Michael Flynn’s ties with Russia, according to the reports. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 172.66 points, or 0.82 per cent, at 20,807.09, the S&P 500 was down 18.86 points, or 0.78 per cent, at 2,381.81 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 58.66 points, or 0.95 per cent, at 6,111.22. This "Trump trauma" also rattled world markets "Equity markets have cooled after their positive run lately and the political uncertainty surrounding Donald Trump is certainly giving traders a reason to cash in their chips," CMC market analyst David Madden said in a note. "Investors have high hopes for Mr. Trump’s vision of America, but the latest scandal puts his plans on hold at the very least, or may not see them implemented at the worst." The most recent headlines follow earlier concerns about Mr. Trump's surprise dismissal of Mr. Comey as well as reports that Mr. Trump divulged sensitive security information to Russia during a White House meeting. Further complicating the picture for the markets is a string of weaker-than-forecast economic reports -- including softer readings on retail sales and inflation -- which have raised concerns about the health of U.S. consumer sentiment. Politics aside, retail shares could get some attention after Target Corp. reported that same-store sales fell less than forecast. The news sent the U.S. retailer's shares higher by 4 per cent. On this side of the border, the S&P/TSX composite fell 69.70 points, or 0.45 per cent, to 15,473.63 as oil prices moved higher after starting the day in the red. A positive but slightly-below forecast reading on Canada's factory sector failed to bolster sentiment Wednesday. Statistics Canada said manufacturing sales rose 1 per cent in March on gains in transportation equipment and food industries. February's decline, however, was revised lower. Overseas, European markets were lower. Britain's blue-chip FTSE 100 was off 0.18 per cent. France’ CAC 40 fell 0.91 per cent and Germany’s DAX fell 0.69 per cent. In Asian markets mostly fell. Japan’s Nikkei 225 dropped 0.5 per cent as the yen gained against the U.S. dollar. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index slipped 0.2 per cent. The Shanghai Composite Index edged 0.26 per cent lower. Commodities Oil prices jumped Wednesday after new figures showed U.S. crude stockpiles fell by 1.8 million barrels last week. Brent and U.S. West Texas Intermediate both jumped immediately after the release of the figures by the U.S. Energy Information Agency. Early in the session, crude prices had been trading lower, responding to figures released Tuesday which showed a surprise build in inventories. Traders have been watching for any suggestion that OPEC supply cuts are reducing the market overhang. Wednesday's decrease in inventories marked the sixth consecutive week of declines. Earlier in the week, the market was underpinned by news that OPEC nations and other big producers that production cuts would be extended beyond earlier projections. In metals, gold jumped to a two-week high as the U.S. dollar fell on news out of Washington. Spot gold rose and, early in the session, had touched its highest level since May 3. Gold prices have now risen for five consecutive days. U.S. gold futures were also higher. “An inherently weaker dollar was seen because of the Trump rhetoric,” said analyst Barnabas Gan at OCBC told Reuters. “Safe-haven demand because of Trump and geopolitical tensions, especially arising out of North Korea’s missile test, is lifting gold prices.” Silver prices were also higher and hit its highest level since May 2 early on. Copper prices were lower on concerns over rising inventories. Currencies and bonds The Canadian dollar was trading higher Wednesday morning - pushing above the 73.50-cent (U.S.) mark - as the U.S. dollar flagged and oil prices rose. The day range so far is 73.31 cents to 73.65 cents. The loonie closed out Tuesday at 73.55 cents. "U.S. political uncertainty is dominating the broader narrative, delivering widespread risk aversion and leaving (the Canadian dollar) vulnerable to external developments," Scotiabank's Shaun Osborne and Eric Theoret said in a note. Overall, they said the loonie is seeing a relatively quiet trading day, remaining most flat against the greenback and underperforming all of the G10 currencies, with the exception of the Australian dollar. Immediately after Statscan released a report showing factory sales in March rose 1 per cent, the loonie slipped close to the low end of the day's range. Economists had been expecting a slightly stronger reading. The report also revised February's decline to 0.6 per cent. Initially, the February decline had been pegged by the agency at 0.2 per cent. The greenback was down against the safe-haven yen. The euro was at a six-month high versus the U.S. dollar, helped by solid recent economic news out of the euro zone. In bonds, the spread between U.S. and German government borrowing costs hit the narrowest in more than six months as political news out of Washington came up against the perception of a more settled political environment in Europe. U.S. Treasury yields fell to three-week lows Wednesday on concerns turmoil in Washington would stall planned tax cuts and infrastructure spending. Benchmark 10-year notes gained 20/32 in price to yield 2.26 per cent, the lowest level since April 25 and down from 2.33 per cent late on Tuesday.  The yield curve between two-year notes and 10-year notes flattened below 100 basis points for the first time since May 3, Reuters reported. Stocks set to see action Target Corp. posted a smaller-than-expected drop in quarterly same-store sales on Wednesday, as sales picked up in March after a slow start to the quarter. Target shares jumped 6.75 per cent in premarket trading on the results. Sales at stores open at least a year fell 1.3 per cent, better than the 3.6-per-cent drop expected by analysts polled by research firm Consensus Metrix. Net income rose to $681-million, or $1.23 per share, in the first quarter ended April 29, from $632-million, or $1.05 per share, a year earlier. "The stock will likely perform well today given the comp and EPS beat, guidance towards the higher end of the EPS range for ’17, the difficult current environment for apparel retailers and the negative sentiment around the stock," Citi analyst Kate McShane said in a morning note. Ford Motor Co. said on Wednesday that it plans to cut 10 percent of its salaried workforce in North America and Asia. The U.S. auto maker employed about 201,000 workers globally as of Dec. 31. Reuters reported the news on Monday, citing a source familiar with the matter. Ford's shares slid 0.5 per cent in premarket trading. Ralph Lauren Corp. named Procter & Gamble executive Patrice Louvet as chief executive, more than three months after his predecessor left the company following differences with founder Ralph Lauren. Louvet’s appointment will be effective July 17, the company said. Ralph Lauren's shares were off 0.6 per cent in premarket trading. Retailer American Eagle Outfitters Inc. reported a surprise rise in quarterly comparable-store sales as strong demand for its Aerie line of lingerie lifted the teen apparel retailer’s sales amid a tough retail climate. The company’s comparable sales rose 2 per cent in the first quarter ended April 29, beating analysts’ average estimate of a 0.7-per-cent decline, according to research firm Consensus Metrix. Net income fell to $25.24-million, or 14 cents per share, in the quarter, from $40.48-million, or 22 cents per share, a year earlier. Its shares fell 7 per cent in premarket trading. Urban Outfitters reported that it earned an adjusted 13 cents per share for its latest quarter, compared to the 16-cent-a-share consensus estimate. Revenue also fell short of expectations. Comparable-store sales fell 3.1 per cent, more than the 2.7-per-cent drop expected by analysts. Its shares still edged up 0.6 per cent in premarket trading. Qualcomm Inc. said on Wednesday it filed a complaint against Foxconn Technology Group and other Apple Inc. manufacturers for breaching license agreements. The chip maker said the manufacturers were refusing to pay royalties on the Apple products produced. Foxconn Technology Group is the trading name of Taiwan’s Hon Hai Precision Industry Co, the main assembler of Apple Inc devices. Qualcomm shares slipped 0.4 per cent in premarket trading. The European Commission launched legal action against Italy on Wednesday for failing to respond to allegations of emission-test cheating by Fiat Chrysler, in a procedure that could lead to the country being taken to court. “The Commission decided today to send a letter of formal notice asking Italy to respond to concerns about insufficient action taken regarding the emission control strategies employed by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles group (FCA),” the Commission said in a statement. Italy now has two months to respond. The Commission may eventually decide to take the country to court if it is not satisfied with the answer. AbbVie slipped 2.5 per cent after Coherus BioSciences received a favourable patent ruling against AbbVie’s Humira drug. Coherus shares rose nearly 8 per cent. Colgate-Palmolive was up 4.7 per cent after the New York Post reported that the toothpaste maker’s CEO had recently signalled he would be open to sell the company.

Statscan says the March gains were led by higher sales in the transportation equipment and food industries. February's decline was revised lower to 0.6 per cent. National Bank senior economist Krishen Rangasamy said, while the March increase was slightly below forecasts, it still suggests a solid showing that puts overall first-quarter GDP growth on track for an annual increase of 3.5 per cent. Canada's first-quarter GDP numbers are due at the end of the month. (10:30 a.m. ET) EIA Petroleum Status Report Japan’s core machinery orders fell short of expectations in March from the previous month and companies forecast a decline in investment over April-June, underscoring the fragile nature of the country’s export-driven economic recovery. Core orders, regarded as a leading indicator of capital spending in the coming six to nine months, rose 1.4 percent in March from the previous month, Cabinet Office data showed on Wednesday. The outcome marked a second straight rising month but undershot the median market forecast for a 2.1 percent gain.

CEO Ian Cook’s stated price tag, valuing the consumer-products giant CL, +5.74%  at more than $88 billion, came at a meeting with institutional investors that took place in recent weeks, a source with knowledge of the conversation said. Rumors about possible deals have swirled of late around the New York-based conglomerate, which has struggled to increase sales of its household staples, which include Irish Spring soap and Hill’s pet food. In particular, there has been talk that Colgate-Palmolive is being stalked by Unilever, the London-based maker of Dove soap, Axe deodorant and Hellmann’s mayonnaise. Last Friday, the chatter even prompted a shareholder to ask Cook at the annual meeting what he would do if Unilever made an offer to buy the company. “We as a company … build value for our share owners and all the constituents in our company,” Cook responded. “And that is what we will focus on and let the rumors and speculation take care of itself.” Aside from the Unilever chatter, speculation has been stoked partly by the fact that activist Nelson Peltz owns a stake in Procter & Gamble, and may be looking to spark sector consolidation. Other possible suitors include Johnson & Johnson as well as the partnership formed by billionaire Warren Buffett and Brazilian conglomerate 3G Capital, which owns Kraft Heinz. Colgate declined to comment on what Cook told investors. This report was first published in the New York Post. More from MarketWatch More Coverage Putin pays Trump?

Will Walmart's results leave brand marketers smiling? Credit: Walmart Most Popular When Walmart reports first-quarter earnings May 18, it could yield plenty of signs about what's really happening in the market and how the giant retailer's reactions will affect the broader world of brands. Here are four big questions brand marketers should hope get answered in Walmart's pre-recorded earnings call. Can Walmart continue the positive momentum? Despite growing slower than Amazon -- like just about everyone else -- Walmart has been improving top-line results over the past two years. It delivered an upside surprise on comparable-store sales growth the prior quarter, its fiscal fourth. This was driven largely by supermarket-size Neighborhood Markets and more aggressive pricing. Walmart's beat came even as grocery-price deflation (fueled in part by Walmart) ended rival Kroger Co.'s 13-year streak of quarterly comp growth. But last quarter was tougher for everyone. Was Walmart a victim or a cause? Many retailers -- and marketers who supply Walmart -- have sung the blues about last quarter. Walmart's results should show whether it was a fellow victim or a cause. It's likely both. Walmart's more aggressive pricing -- aimed particularly at fending off Amazon and hard discounter Aldi -- has caught other retailers in the crossfire, particularly Kroger and Dollar General. But rising gas prices -- up around 20% from a year ago -- also hurt consumer spending elsewhere. And Walmart is particularly vulnerable here. It's underrepresented in big urban markets, where people use mass transit, and overrepresented everywhere else, where people drive more. How big of a problem will Walmart be for brands? Suppliers like Procter & Gamble Co., Unilever and Kimberly-Clark all cited retailer inventory reductions as a cause for weak U.S. results last quarter. That cost-cutting "retailer" was likely Walmart. Its comparable-store inventory declined 7.2% in the fiscal fourth quarter despite 1.8% comp sales growth. Thursday's results will show to what extent the trend continued, and maybe if it will abate as brand marketers have projected. Suppliers are also wary of being casualties in Walmart's war with hard discounters. These include Aldi, which already has 1,600 stores and plans another 650 by the end of next year, and its German compatriot Lidl, which also has U.S. expansion plans and has been reported to be scouting sites from the Mid-South to Cincinnati. Hard discounters sell mainly private labels, allowing them to undercut Walmart on price, which in turn pressures Walmart to expand its own private labels and push brands to lower prices. And what about that war with Amazon? Walmart e-commerce actually grew faster than Amazon in the fourth quarter. Much of that 29% growth came from the August acquisition of Jet.com. But even legacy Walmart.com has been doing better under Jet.com-turned-Walmart E-Commerce CEO Marc Lore -- adding 0.4 percentage points to Walmart's U.S. comp growth in the fiscal fourth quarter vs. 0.3 points the prior year. Thursday's results will show whether that momentum continued into the new year amid distractions from a slew of smaller e-commerce buys, including Modcloth, Shoebuy and Moosejaw. Walmart is still more than three times bigger than Amazon in the U.S. But its e-commerce sales are only around a sixth of Amazon, which dominates e-commerce to an extent Walmart never did brick-and-mortar. If the two retailers keep growing at last year's rates, Amazon will be bigger than Walmart in the U.S. by 2025.

Healthcare benefits such as effective scalp treatment and hair smoothening have further compelled the adoption of hairbrushes among both male and female customers. Moreover, continuous introduction of new and innovative products by leading manufacturers of beauty products have resulted in a shortened buying cycle for various hair care products. Numerous high end providers of hair hygiene products including brushes make use of different sales channels such as specialty salons, TV shows and celebrity endorsements in order to gain higher popularity for their latest products. On account of shifting consumer preferences and supply of advanced products, the market is expected to witness an increasing demand in the high-end luxury product segment. Thereby, the overall hairbrush market is expected to witness continued growth during the forecast period. Competitive Insights: The global hair brush market is fairly consolidated with few of the leading providers of hair brushes attributing to major share of the overall hair brushes market globally. Some of the leading hair brush manufacturers included Conair Group Ltd., Procter & Gamble Company, Kent & Sons Plc., L’Oreal Group, Helen of Troy Limited, Tangle Teezer Limited, Ibiza Hair, Inc., Denman International Ltd., Mason Pearson Bros. Ltd. and Spornette International, Inc. These leading global players face immense competition from numerous local manufacturers providing simplistic and cheaper products. However, with rising middle class across the world and increasing consumer spending towards hair hygiene, the leading companies are expected to witness and increase in their consumer base during the forecast period. Key Trends: Introduction of smart hair brushes which make use of various sensing technologies to record and analyze parameters on smartphone applications Growing demand for high-end products in the animal use segment Market primarily driven by the professionals segment with enhanced endorsements at specialty salons Request Sample: http://www.credenceresearch.com/sample-request/58446 Blog: http://techtopworld.com/2017/05/05/hair-brush-market-global-industry-outlook-industry-share-market-size-strategies-forecast-2017-2022/ About: Credence Research is a worldwide market research and counseling firm that serves driving organizations, governments, non-legislative associations, and not-for-benefits.

The Answer’s Unclear. By Sydney Lupkin and Pauline Bartolone May 17, 2017 Sherry Herman, 50, of Dayton, Ohio, had been taking generic Prilosec for a decade when she was diagnosed with chronic kidney disease. (Ty Greenlees for KHN) Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Email Print Republish Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Email Print Republish Sherry Herman was watching TV when the ad popped up on the screen. Lawyers were seeking clients for a class-action lawsuit, suggesting a link between certain heartburn pills and chronic kidney disease — including the beige capsules she’d taken for years. “And I was like, ‘Oh my gosh, yeah — me!’” said Herman, a 50-year-old homemaker in Dayton, Ohio. She’d been on a drug known as a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) for acid reflux disease since 2004. Thinking it was a “very safe drug,” she had taken the prescription pills for a decade, even though the label recommended four to eight weeks. Then, in 2014, she was diagnosed with chronic kidney disease. “It came as a huge shock because no one in my family has it,” she said. She had no risk factors for the condition, such as poorly controlled high blood pressure. This story also ran in The Daily Beast. It can be republished for free (details). A growing body of research suggests the blockbuster drug that helped her stomach may have left her — and a number of patients like her — with a potentially much more serious medical problem. Recent research has linked the proton pump inhibitors, or PPIs, to serious side effects, including chronic kidney disease, and recently filed lawsuits allege, among other things, that the manufacturers should have known of their potential harms. The risk of chronic kidney disease is as much as 50 percent higher in people who’ve taken the drug compared with those who’ve not — although no causative link has been proven and manufacturers insist they are safe. In light of recent studies and lawsuits, Herman wonders whether her heartburn medication is to blame for her chronic kidney disease. (Ty Greenlees for KHN) The drugmakers strongly defend their products. AstraZeneca is “confident in the safety and efficacy of Nexium and Prilosec when used in accordance with the FDA approved label,” said spokeswoman Abby Bozarth, in an emailed statement. Proton pump inhibitors, such as Nexium and Prilosec, among other brands, are blockbusters in the U.S. With 15.3 million prescriptions written in 2013 alone, they are considered highly effective at relieving gastroesophageal acid reflux as well as preventing and treating ulcers. Widely advertised, they are frequently prescribed for even minor indigestion, with serial renewals leading to chronic use — even though they were approved as safe by the Food and Drug Administration only for short-term treatment. Studies have shown that PPIs could be prescribed unnecessarily as much as two-thirds of the time. And it’s not uncommon for patients to take the heartburn pills for years, even though their labels recommend limiting treatment to a few weeks or a few months. The result has been sales worth many billions of dollars a year for pharmaceutical companies, according to commercial intelligence firm EvaluatePharma. Tens of millions of Americans take the drugs, whether in prescription or over-the-counter formulation. Given those numbers, critics say that even the suggestion of risk is a problem for a drug that is over-prescribed by doctors and used inappropriately by patients. “When patients complain of gastrointestinal distress, it’s easy to just prescribe a PPI,” said Steven Chen, a doctor of pharmacy and associate dean for clinical affairs at the University of Southern California School of Pharmacy. Once patients start taking the drug, it’s easy to “forget that they may not need to be on it that long.” What’s more, fueling debate and the emerging lawsuits is FDA’s patchwork system that experts say is poorly equipped to track adverse events — even when they involve drugs like the PPIs that have been used by many millions of American over three decades. With no universally mandatory system to track the use of drugs and their side effects over time, the U.S. instead relies on manufacturers, doctors and patients to convey suspicion of harm as part of a mostly voluntary system. Dr. Sammy Almashat, of the research group Public Citizen, said only a small fraction of side effects are reported to the FDA and the database is “underutilized” by researchers and regulators. “We do what we can in this country with what we’re given. It’s not much.” Herman reviews her notes from past doctor appointments, including her creatinine levels and glomerular filtration rate, which help indicate how well her kidneys are functioning. (Ty Greenlees for KHN) A Godsend With An Uncertain Risk-Benefit Ratio PPIs, which came to market in 1990, were a godsend for many patients. When Paula Cox, 69, of Bainbridge Island, Wash., first tried Prilosec, it was like “heaven” because the medication prevented the “extremely intense” heartburn symptoms that had plagued her since the 1980s. She’s been on the pills for over 14 years, and although she hasn’t suffered any of the major health problems linked to them by research, she’d like to stop her daily regimen, especially in light of news about possible side effects. But Prilosec is “the only thing that’s working,” Cox said. PPIs work by blocking an enzyme in the cells that line the stomach, preventing them from secreting acid. They are the leading proven therapy for upper-gastrointestinal disorders, available by prescription and, in lower doses, over the counter. Paula Cox, 69, of Bainbridge Island, Wash., has been taking proton pump inhibitors since the early 2000s. (Courtesy of Paula Cox) Chronic kidney disease damages the organs over time, rendering the body unable to eliminate wastes from the blood and excrete them through urine. The disease can be life-threatening, and patients may need dialysis or a kidney transplant to survive. Two huge studies, including data from hundreds of thousands of patients taking prescription PPIs, raised concerns about a link between the pills and kidney failure in 2016. (Over-the-counter medications were not studied because of the difficulty of collecting data.) Both studies, one published in JAMA Internal Medicine and the other in the Journal of the American Society of Nephrology, found that those taking prescription PPIs were more likely to develop kidney disease than patients taking another class of drugs known as H2 blockers, which treat similar digestive symptoms. The research showed that patients taking the PPIs twice a day were more likely to develop the disease, and that the kidney risk associated with the pills increased over time for the first two years. Each study had the same limitation: It was “observational,” meaning it was not a gold-standard clinical trial that could prove cause and effect. Based on a collection of health records, the research could identify only association — i.e., whether patients taking PPIs were more likely to develop chronic kidney disease than patients who weren’t on the drugs. “Although they’re seen as pretty benign medicines, [they] may not be,” said Johns Hopkins nephrologist Dr. Morgan Grams, noting that the drugs might cause damage by lowering magnesium levels or triggering an immune reaction. But others, like Dr. John Danziger, a nephrologist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and a professor at Harvard Medical School, are skeptical about the association noting that PPIs have also been tied to a number of other risks, including a rare type of infectious diarrheas, pneumonia and bone fracture. “Is it that the PPI is really causing all these different things or is it the fact that sicker people get PPIs and sicker people have bad outcomes?” Danziger said. “I think it’s probably the latter.” The experience of Harry Mason, 69, shows how difficult it is to sort out the question of cause and effect, and the legal quandaries that arise from that. The Vietnam veteran from western Illinois “suffered kidney failure requiring a kidney transplant while taking Nexium as prescribed in 2006,” according to a lawsuit he filed against AstraZeneca in May 2016. But he has also had congestive heart failure, diabetes and an enlarged prostate, and he takes medication to control his cholesterol. While a law firm initially advised him to sue, it later dropped the case because it determined his kidneys were likely harmed by something else, said Mason. AstraZeneca had filed a request to dismiss the case, claiming Mason’s “sweeping accusations” weren’t backed up with facts. A Legion Of Lawsuits Attorney Paul Pennock said his New York-based firm, Weitz & Luxenberg, is investigating roughly 3,500 cases involving kidney harm allegedly from heartburn drugs, although he acknowledges not all will merit a lawsuit. Nationwide, Pennock said, about 122 suits have been filed, against AstraZeneca and other PPI makers such as Takeda Pharmaceuticals, Pfizer and Procter & Gamble, which produces over-the-counter Prilosec. Allyanna Anglim of Pfizer media relations says legal actions against the company are “without merit” and its PPI labels “have always provided accurate information on their benefits and risks.” Why, after all these years, aren’t the risks better known? FDA spokeswoman Andrea Fischer said data linking chronic kidney disease and PPIs “are limited” but that the agency continues to monitor the potential risks. Both medical researchers and the Government Accountability Office have concluded that its methods for doing so are inadequate. Reports to the FDA mentioning PPIs in relation to a range of kidney problems trickled in and reached a few dozen per year by the late 1990s, according to a Kaiser Health News analysis of the federal Adverse Event Reporting System. The number of kidney-related reports naming PPIs as a primary suspect slowly crept up over the years and then doubled to more than 400 in 2016, the year the two prominent studies were published. Doctors, consumers and manufacturers submit the reports mostly voluntarily, and they are not verified. The full side-effects profile of the pills only slowly becomes apparent over the years. Based on dozens of studies and cases, the FDA began requiring PPI labels to include the risk of bone fracture, low magnesium and infectious diarrhea from 2010 to 2012. Through a lawsuit, the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen forced the FDA in 2014 to add acute interstitial nephritis, a kidney disorder in which structures in the kidneys become swollen, said the nonprofit’s Almashat. Public Citizen is not planning further action on PPIs in light of the two recent studies flagging chronic kidney disease, but as more research is published the organization may consider it. Research about the potential harms of PPIs don’t mean the “sky is falling,” but doctors should have a “nuanced” conversation with patients about the risks versus benefits of the drugs, said Dr. Kenneth DeVault, a past president of the American College of Gastroenterology. He considers recent PPI research when deciding whether he should prescribe the medication, he said, as should other gastroenterologists. Sherry Herman of Ohio has decided to keep taking her generic PPI even though she has stage 3 kidney disease, for the pain relief it gives. “It’s such a scary thing to me that I just try to block it out,” she said.

				<h1>Do Best-Selling Drugs That Calm Stomachs Damage Kidneys? The Answer’s Unclear.</h1>			<span class="byline">By <a href="http://khn.org/news/author/sydney-lupkin/"><strong>Sydney Lupkin</strong></a> and <a href="http://khn.org/news/author/pauline-bartolone/"><strong>Pauline Bartolone</strong></a></span>
	<p>Sherry Herman was watching TV when the ad popped up on the screen. Lawyers were seeking clients for a class-action lawsuit, suggesting a link between certain heartburn pills and chronic kidney disease — including the beige capsules she’d taken for years.</p>
<p>“And I was like, ‘Oh my gosh, yeah — me!’” said Herman, a 50-year-old homemaker in Dayton, Ohio.</p>
<p>She’d been on a drug known as a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) for acid reflux disease since 2004. Thinking it was a “very safe drug,” she had taken the prescription pills for a decade, even though the label recommended four to eight weeks.</p>
<p>Then, in 2014, she was diagnosed with chronic kidney disease. “It came as a huge shock because no one in my family has it,” she said. She had no risk factors for the condition, such as poorly controlled high blood pressure.</p>

<p>A growing body of research suggests the blockbuster drug that helped her stomach may have left her — and a number of patients like her — with a potentially much more serious medical problem.</p>
<p>Recent research has linked the proton pump inhibitors, or PPIs, to serious side effects, including chronic kidney disease, and recently filed lawsuits allege, among other things, that the manufacturers should have known of their potential harms. The risk of chronic kidney disease is as much as 50 percent higher in people who’ve taken the drug compared with those who’ve not — although no causative link has been proven and manufacturers insist they are safe.</p>

<p>The drugmakers strongly defend their products. AstraZeneca is “confident in the safety and efficacy of Nexium and Prilosec when used in accordance with the FDA approved label,” said spokeswoman Abby Bozarth, in an emailed statement.</p>
<p>Proton pump inhibitors, such as Nexium and Prilosec, among other brands, are blockbusters in the U.S. With 15.3 million prescriptions written in 2013 alone, they are considered highly effective at relieving gastroesophageal acid reflux as well as preventing and treating ulcers. Widely advertised, they are frequently prescribed for even minor indigestion, with serial renewals leading to chronic use — even though they were approved as safe by the Food and Drug Administration only for short-term treatment.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21250399">Studies</a> have shown that PPIs could be prescribed unnecessarily as much as two-thirds of the time. And it’s not uncommon for patients to take the heartburn pills for years, even though their labels recommend limiting treatment to a few weeks or a few months. The result has been sales worth many billions of dollars a year for pharmaceutical companies, according to commercial intelligence firm <a href="http://www.evaluategroup.com/public/EvaluatePharma-Overview.aspx">EvaluatePharma</a>.</p>
<p>Tens of millions of Americans take the drugs, whether in prescription or over-the-counter formulation. Given those numbers, critics say that even the suggestion of risk is a problem for a drug that is over-prescribed by doctors and used inappropriately by patients.</p>
<p>“When patients complain of gastrointestinal distress, it’s easy to just prescribe a PPI,” said Steven Chen, a doctor of pharmacy and associate dean for clinical affairs at the University of Southern California School of Pharmacy. Once patients start taking the drug, it’s easy to “forget that they may not need to be on it that long.”</p>
<p>What’s more, fueling debate and the emerging lawsuits is FDA’s patchwork system that experts say is poorly equipped to track adverse events — even when they involve drugs like the PPIs that have been used by many millions of American over three decades. With no universally mandatory system to track the use of drugs and their side effects over time, the U.S. instead relies on manufacturers, doctors and patients to convey suspicion of harm as part of a mostly voluntary system.</p>
<p>Dr. Sammy Almashat, of the research group Public Citizen, said only a small fraction of side effects are reported to the FDA and the database is “underutilized” by researchers and regulators. “We do what we can in this country with what we’re given. It’s not much.”</p>

<p>A Godsend With An Uncertain Risk-Benefit Ratio</p>
<p>PPIs, which came to market in 1990, were a godsend for many patients.</p>
<p>When Paula Cox, 69, of Bainbridge Island, Wash., first tried Prilosec, it was like “heaven” because the medication prevented the “extremely intense” heartburn symptoms that had plagued her since the 1980s. She’s been on the pills for over 14 years, and although she hasn’t suffered any of the major health problems linked to them by research, she’d like to stop her daily regimen, especially in light of news about possible side effects. But Prilosec is “the only thing that’s working,” Cox said.</p>
<p>PPIs work by blocking an enzyme in the cells that line the stomach, preventing them from secreting acid. They <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3388523/">are the leading proven therapy</a> for upper-gastrointestinal disorders, available by prescription and, in lower doses, over the counter.</p>

<p>Chronic kidney disease damages the organs over time, rendering the body unable to eliminate wastes from the blood and excrete them through urine. The disease can be life-threatening, and patients may need dialysis or a kidney transplant to survive.</p>
<p>Two huge studies, including data from hundreds of thousands of patients taking prescription PPIs, raised concerns about a link between the pills and kidney failure in 2016. (Over-the-counter medications were not studied because of the difficulty of collecting data.)</p>
<p>Both studies, one published in <a href="http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2481157">JAMA Internal Medicine</a> and the other in the <a href="http://jasn.asnjournals.org/content/early/2016/04/13/ASN.2015121377">Journal of the American Society of Nephrology</a>, found that those taking prescription PPIs were more likely to develop kidney disease than patients taking another class of drugs known as H2 blockers, which treat similar digestive symptoms. The research showed that patients taking the PPIs twice a day were more likely to develop the disease, and that the kidney risk associated with the pills increased over time for the first two years.

CEO Ian Cook’s stated price tag, valuing the consumer-products giant at more than $88 billion, came at a meeting with institutional investors that took place in recent weeks, a source with knowledge of the conversation said. Rumors about possible deals have swirled of late around the New York-based conglomerate, which has struggled to increase sales of its household staples, which include Irish Spring soap and Hill’s pet food. In particular, there has been talk that Colgate-Palmolive is being stalked by Unilever, the London-based maker of Dove soap, Axe deodorant and Hellmann’s mayonnaise. Last Friday, the chatter even prompted a shareholder to ask Cook at the annual meeting what he would do if Unilever made an offer to buy the company. “We as a company … build value for our share owners and all the constituents in our company,” Cook responded. “And that is what we will focus on and let the rumors and speculation take care of itself.” Aside from the Unilever chatter, speculation has been stoked partly by the fact that activist Nelson Peltz owns a stake in Procter & Gamble, and may be looking to spark sector consolidation.

Photos Videos Topics Live Cricket Score Home India Mumbai Delhi World Business Technology Sports IPL Entertainment Bollywood Hollywood Television Lifestyle Education & Careers TRENDING# Kulbhushan Jadhav Kapil Mishra Narendra Modi Exam results 2017 Donald Trump News Business News Biyani's fbb first Indian retail brand to venture overseas Kishore Biyani Shares185 Ashish K Tiwari | Wed, 17 May 2017-07:35am , Mumbai , DNA Future Group’s clothing business in the current fiscal will be Rs 12,000 crore, including fbb, Central formats In an industry-first, Kishore Biyani promoted Future Group is taking its fast fashion apparel retail brand 'fbb' overseas. The retailer has entered into an equal joint venture with Oman-based business conglomerate Khimji Ramdas (KR) LLC to open exclusive 'fbb' stores in Oman. "We thought of getting into a region around us for exploring international forays and hence zeroed in on Oman. There are a lot of retailers who have come from that region into India and I think it's time for somebody to go in that region. That's the opportunity we have been looking for and have found the right partner to expand our business," said Kishore Biyani, group CEO, Future Group, adding that fbb will be nearly 70% of the clothing it sells currently in India. The joint venture, KR Future Fashions LLC, will see the partners invest a total Rs 150 crore in the business. While 4-5 fbb stores will be launched initially, the plan is to take the number to 17-18 stores over a period of time. The first fbb store is likely to get operational in the first quarter next year. Interestingly, Biyani will also adopt a differentiated pricing strategy for the Oman market, wherein the apparel will be sold at prices that are lower than in India. Nailesh Khimji, director, Khimji Ramdas LLC, said, "We want to add to our strengths, which is distribution and logistics in Oman, and get apparel retailing expertise from the Future Group to form a company that will be strong in both areas. Once we feel, Oman has achieved the expected key performance indicators (KPIs), we will start looking at expanding into the region including all the Gulf countries." Future Group will also be leveraging KR Group's logistics and distribution expertise (in Oman and Gujarat) to sell its fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) products there – KR LLC operates 75 supermarkets under brands like SPAR, Khimji's Mart etc while also distributing products from P&G, Britannia, Amul, etc. "We are looking at adding Future Group's food and FMCG brands on our distribution network as well," said Khimji. The overall plan is to eventually expand the apparel retail operations as well as FMCG distribution across the GCC and MENA region in the years to come. Biyani sees the fashion space as a huge opportunity in and outside India and hence started looking at markets including Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and UAE for the international foray. By next year, the company is targeting to sell close to 30 crore garment pieces and has a target of selling 100 crore garment pieces over the next four to five years. "That can only happen if we spread our wings. We currently operate in 27 out of 29 states in India. I believe, foraying into the UAE region is a huge opportunity and we will use this as a stepping stone to enter other geographies like Africa," Biyani said, adding that the group's clothing business in the current fiscal will be around Rs 12,000 crore, including fbb, Central and other apparel retailing formats, and it can touch around 50,000 crore once the target of 100 crore garment pieces is met.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 18 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Geometry Global and Blippar Announce Global Strategic Partnership to Create „Augmented Retail” /EINPresswire.com/ — NEW YORK, NY –(Marketwired – May 17, 2017) – Geometry Global, award-winning shopper marketing and brand activation agency network, and Blippar, a technology company specializing in augmented reality (AR), computer vision and artificial intelligence (AI), today announce a global strategic partnership. The purpose is to bring added value to clients by capitalizing on opportunities offered by AR in the physical and digital retail space. Brands gain immediate access to „augmented retail,” helping their shoppers overcome purchase barriers. Geometry gains strategic advantage as employees are trained on how to create and deliver AR content and Blippar extends its reach, as its platform becomes the base for more retail activations. Using Blippar’s AR creation tools Blippbuilder and Blippbuilder Script, Geometry will create best-in-class Augmented Reality in-house that can support the shopping journey in and around retail environments with product specific, relevant digital content. Both companies will cross-refer business opportunities and collaborate on joint projects. The partnership launches in the UK and will roll out in the U.S. and Germany, which will act as a hub for continental Europe. Debbie Ellison, Head of Digital Geometry UK and recent winner of the Women of Tomorrow award, leads the partnership with responsibility for global rollout. Jon Hamm, Global Chief Creative Officer of Geometry Global, commented, „This partnership provides Geometry’s clients around the world the opportunity to engage in AR marketing that makes the most impact for their brand. Partnering with Blippar gives Geometry a distinctive advantage in forging a link for brands in the digital and physical retail environments, creating engagement in-store, and ultimately driving a positive product experience.” Omaid Hiwaizi, Global Head of Experience Strategy at Blippar, added, „Augmented Reality is a critical new frontier for retail since it can help brands overcome purchase barriers by providing shoppers with information and engaging experiences at the point of sale. Given Geometry’s activation and shopping behavior transformation sweet spot, this partnership creates the perfect context to define the rules on AR in retail, shopper and brand storytelling.” According to predictions in the Digi-Capital’s Augmented/Virtual Reality Report 2017, mobile AR could be an $83 billion market by 2021.
