Purchase book “India grows at night while the government sleeps” is an Indian expression referring to the country’s impressive economic rise despite the presence of a large, burdensome state. Gurcharan Das will explain how India’s story of private success and public failure is not sustainable and that the country’s recent growth slowdown signals the need for a strong liberal state that would ensure accountability, perform limited and well-defined functions, and base itself on the rule of law.

Indian society is being transformed by the decline of the centralized bureaucratic state and the emergence of a market economy. Gurcharan Das will describe how sustained high growth rates are leading to the dramatic rise of the Indian middle class, the breakdown of the caste system, changing attitudes toward entrepreneurship, and a new political dynamic. According to Das, that “silent revolution” affecting one-sixth of humanity has far-reaching implications for the future of liberalism in the world. Swaminathan Aiyar will assess Das’s optimism, put India’s current lack of reforms into context, and highlight his country’s main challenges.

That’s how you survive.” – Cecilio Pedro It all started with a young boy’s passion and willpower to create change in the community. Cecilio Kwok Pedro, the founder and president of Lamoiyan Corp., did not build his empire overnight. He endured failures and disappointments along the way that made him the person he is today. Blossoming entrepreneurial mindset When he was still studying, he used to sell ball pens to his classmates. Surprisingly, the pens ran out fast, but most if not all were purchased in credit. At this stage of his life, we can already see an entrepreneurial mindset waiting to blossom. The journey continued right after college; he opened a hardware store in Alonzo, Manila. The area is known as the hub for hardware stores and a new entrant will have difficulty in penetrating the market arena. The competition was so stiff that he ended up closing his business.  In the mid 1970s, he once again ventured in a new investment. This time he opened Aluminum Container Inc. The company was one the suppliers of the aluminum toothpaste packaging to large fast moving consumer goods companies such as Procter and Gamble, Unilever and Colgate-Palmolive. During that time, aluminum was the most trusted raw material for that item. The performance of the business was driving smoothly until his clients opted to change the material they used from aluminum to plastic. It was an end of an era that forced suppliers to eventually close their company. This hiccup did not allow Cecilio Pedro to lose hope; in fact, he once again took the risk. This decision led to the birth of one of the largest Filipino-owned fast moving consumer goods companies, known as Lamoiyan Corp., maker of Hapee toothpase. Leading by example True to its tagline of “Making the difference for the glory of God,” Cecilio Pedro is a strong believer of social responsibility. He is not only focused on generating profit, but his push is also to contribute to the environment and community. I think they are the first corporation who employs people with hearing disability. With this gesture, hope was restored to these hearing-impaired employees.  The reality is people with disability are given unequal opportunities in the society, which in effect, destroy their moral and self-importance. As much as possible, he really wants to help by leading by example. His main intention is to encourage other businessmen to also be socially active in helping the community. Making the dream a reality The entry and involvement of deaf people in the daily operations was not easy for the company. A lot of adjustments were made in order to achieve a peaceful and productive working environment. The management and its employees were also taught sign languages in order to communicate with them. I admire how he integrated Corporate Social Responsibility to the company’s thrusts. If you come to think of it, hiring someone with an impairment may be a big challenge. But he followed his heart and made his dream of making a difference a reality. As future Lasallian business leaders, this is something that we can emulate from Lamoiyan’s founder so we can be that change in our own communities. The author is an MBA student at the Ramon V. del Rosario College of Business. This essay is part of a journal he kept in fulfillment of the requirements of the course, Lasallian Business Leadership with Corporate Social Responsibility and Ethics.  Visit his blog at https://thegreenchatterbox.wordpress.com/.

Baker / Published: May 28, 2017 Article Tools Font size – + Share This     ROBERT BAKER / STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER Horse and buggy rides added to the Christmas spirit last December in downtown Tunkhannock. On the eve of a new historical walking tour through Tunkhannock unveiled last summer, Mayor Norm Ball responded to a question about all the good things that seemed to be happening to Tunkhannock. “I wish I could take credit for it all, but the truth of the matter is that we have great groups of volunteers who know how to act when they see a need,” he said. About 20 years ago, tractor-trailer rigs carrying products from the mammoth Procter & Gamble plant 5 miles away in Washington Twp. clogged Tunkhannock’s main thoroughfares —Tioga and Bridge streets — to the point that normal business traffic was reduced to a crawl, taking a half hour to move just a couple of miles. Enter Joe DeMarco, chairman of the borough’s bypass committee, who once described his role in making the road a reality as being “a burr under people’s saddles.” The $26.5 million Tunkhannock Bypass was dedicated on Nov. 7, 2001. Almost overnight, the downtown could breathe again, and the public warmed to the idea of a business district with a “real” future. A year later, local resident Hildy Morgan spearheaded the notion of taking a rundown theater there closed since the 1980s and resurrecting it. In 2011, Morgan passed the mantle of caring for what by that time had become a four-theater Wyoming County Cultural Center to Erica Rogler and Margie Young, and it has become a magnet for economic development in town. “No, they weren’t trying to make money, but people saw the Dietrich (theater) as something positive that others wished to build on,” said Beth Bevan, who now serves as president of the Tunkhannock Business and Professional Association. “On a personal level, I also believe it provides a great opportunity for old-fashioned dating, and we need that in our lives.” TBPA Executive Director Nancy Parlo noted that people from Clarks Summit and Dallas — as well as Wilkes-Barre and Scranton — were telling her they’d rather go to a movie in Tunkhannock than head to one of the regional multiplexes, and besides, they could eat in one of the local restaurants and visit the town’s quaint shops before a movie. While the Dietrich was coming into its own, Wyoming County Commissioner and businesswoman Judy Kraft Mead spearheaded a streetscape development with grant money that not only improved the sidewalks in the business district but added 87 Victorian-style lampposts to give it an antique ambiance. Almost simultaneously, a new library and hose company headquarters moved into more modern spaces. Tunkhannock’s future began to look rosy in 2006 when the Marcellus gas was identified as being beneath the local citizens’ feet and it seemed cost-effective to bring it up by a process known as fracking. On the last weekend of September 2009, Wyoming County Recorder of Deeds Dennis Montross estimated that roughly $230 million in lease money changed hands between Chesapeake Energy and Wyoming County landowners. With money in their pockets, a boom was forecasted locally, and almost overnight two hotels — the Hampton Inn on the east end of town, and the Comfort Inn just across the river from Tunkhannock — had a groundbreaking. And almost simultaneously, the Prince Hotel, which had stood on the corner of Tioga and Bridge streets for 167 years, was sold, with buyer Samir “Sunny” Mehta promising to upgrade the landmark by pumping into it what some claim was close to $1 million. Then two things happened. The price of gas on the world market dropped precipitously, and Tunkhannock itself was ravaged by a flood in 2011 that saw water from the Susquehanna River get to its highest flood stage ever. That the area economy — and particularly the gas companies — had money in their pockets meant that cleanup efforts were expedited in ways that other river towns in the Wyoming Valley were not so fortunate to see. As the gas price has improved, drilling activity has returned to the region, but not with anything like the initial burst. The downtown district is feeling some pain, with some obvious storefront vacancies on Tioga Street as well as the closure of Seasons Restaurant, and announcements in the past 12 months that both the Prince Hotel and Brick’s Grocery Market are looking for buyers. It’s not cause for alarm, said Donna LaBar, who has worked as a real estate agent in Tunkhannock for 32 years and is a broker for Century 21 Sherlock Homes Inc. “I’ve seen cycles like this come and go,” LaBar said. Sometimes businesses have owners who experience life changes — such as those who retire — but have no one to take over the operation. “I don’t see it as negative,” she said. “These businesses have grown; they need to offer more parking and more services and things will improve.” Contact the writer: bbaker@wcexaminer.com We welcome user discussion on our site, under the following guidelines: To comment you must first create a profile and sign-in with a verified DISQUS account or social network ID.
