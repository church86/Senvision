MENU All Girls Fantasy Sports Advice Real sports As seen on tv Rankings Everything else Shop Home Animals Current Page Super Bowl Ad Roundup: This New Mr. Clean Is Very Disturbing Tweet Rick Chandler 3:38 pm, January 26th, 2017 The Super Bowl commercials to start rolling in, and Sportsgrid is there — giving you the lowdown on the latest ads. At approximately $5 million per 30 seconds, companies are going all out to sell you their wares — one might call this the Super Bowl of TV advertising. Wait, what? As the new spots come out, we’ll be keeping you up to date right here, and when we get enough full ads we’ll rank ’em. Check back every day until Feb. 5. UPDATES: * Febreeze The Halftime Bathroom Break is threatening to pollute America, and only Febreeze can save us. * Mr. Clean The full ad is out today, and baby it’s hot … for the ladies. The Full Ads Believe it or not, Mr. Clean is coming up on his 60th anniversary next year. Making his debut in 1958, the Procter & Gamble cleaning product was invented by the owner of a shipping line who needed a non-toxic cleaning product that wouldn’t make his workers sick. Mr. Clean immediately became the top-selling household cleaner on the market. Its mascot, the smiling genie-in-a-cleaning-bottle, has changed little in 59 years — in appearance, anyway. This year Procter & Gamble has introduced a new, sexy Mr. Clean, a detergent gigolo who just may seduce your wife if you’re not vigilant. In its Super Bowl debut, Procter & Gamble gives us the new Mr. Clean. I feel a little ill: Skittles checks in with their new ad, and it’s an upgrade from last year’s bizarre Steven Tyler nightmare-inducer. “Katy! …” TurboTax is back for the fourth consecutive year with a 45-second spot, starring Humpty Dumpty. Wix would like to remind you that it’s easy to make your own stunning web site. Although what that has to do with busting up a restaurant is unclear. Intel apparently thinks that people will watch Tom Brady do anything — even brush his teeth before eating a pancake off of the floor. After taking it away from a dog. I would have re-thought this one. Teaser Trailers Febreeze is another Procter & Gamble product, this one which probes the phenomenon of the Halftime Bathroom break. Includes stock footage of a buffalo stampede so you know its good. We don’t know exactly how this is going to work, but Snickers‘ 30-second spot will be live to lead off the third quarter of the game. It will feature Adam Driver (Kylo Ren in Star Wars: The Force Awakens, and be preceded by a 36-hour livestream, at SnickersLive.com (noon ET on Thursday, Feb. 2, until midnight Friday night. Here are four teasers, combined for your convenience. None of it makes any sense so far. GoDaddy is under new management (a new ad agency), and is back after skipping Super Bowl 50. According to AdAge, the ad will go like this: “In GoDaddy’s commercial, we will be introduced to the ‘Internet,’ who is covered in tattoos of web references, like Wi-Fi symbols, memes and floppy discs. The 30-second game day spot will include a look inside the house of the ‘Internet’ and will feature a song made popular by the internet. While most of the references included in the commercial will be recognizable to a broad audience, there will be some more obscure references hidden throughout.” Avocados From Mexico is back, and the ad — to be shown during the first commercial break of the game — will focus on the avocado being a health food. Since more avocados are consumed during the Super Bowl than during any other time of the year, it’s surprising that AFM have only been in the past three big games. Here’s the teaser trailer, featuring Jon Lovitz: Kia is going to make you wait awhile to see what’s chasing Melissa McCarthy. PepsiCo will be touting its line of bottled water products, Lifewtr, with its Inspiration Drops spot. Featured will be a song by John Legend. Not participating this year Butterfinger, Doritos, Mini USA, SunTrust, Taco Bell, Toyota, Visa. Heinz, which gave us the entertaining Weiner Stampede during last year’s game, is also not returning to the Super Bowl. But they saved a few mil by running an ad right after the game, and releasing an extended version online (which may be the wave of the future). Heinz has started a petition to make the day after the Super Bowl and national holiday.

Published on January 26, 2017. Most Popular Mr. Clean has lived nearly 60 years without making it into a Super Bowl ad. It turns out he was just waiting for the right time, when he could be a role model as an irresistibly sexy modern guy who cleans. The Procter & Gamble Co. brand will make its Super Bowl debut with an ad from Leo Burnett, Toronto, showing a woman turned on by a sexy animated version of the animated icon, who then morphs into her husband, who has been helping out with household chores. At that point she jumps on him passionately, forcing him onto a couch, as the tagline "You gotta love a man who cleans" appears. Related Stories Super Bowl LI Complete Ad Chart "There's no better way to reach a co-ed audience than the Super Bowl," said Martin Hettich, the P&G VP-North American Home Care who greenlighted the ad. "And the subject we're broaching with Mr. Clean really is for a co-ed audience, because it's talking about cleaning and how men and women divide up the chores. And there's still a way to go." While some surveys, even those cited in the past by sibling brand Swiffer, show most men believe that they do at least an equal amount of household work, P&G research suggests they aren't doing as much as they think. "There's a clear disconnect between what men say they're doing and what they're actually doing," Mr. Hettich said, with only 32% of men doing the majority of cleaning in a household vs. 44% of women, with equal sharing in around 17% of households. Mr. Clean's brand going back to the 1950s was about a genie-in-a-bottle helping women with chores. But the growing possibility of men shouldering the cleaning burden, particularly among millennials, makes the idea of that mythical figure morphing into a real guy more believable now, as Mr. Hettich sees it. He also hopes the fact that things still don't really happen that way in many households can help the ad spur conversation and social-media buzz, amplified by Super Bowl viewers' tendency to post on Twitter and Facebook throughout the game. As for the sexy part, Mr. Hettich said, the brand wants to stake out a unique position in its category by asking if cleaning can be "part of the appeal in a relationship." P&G research suggests that it can, he said. Mr. Clean may be the elder statesman in P&G home care, but he's long since been surpassed in sales and media budgets by the likes of Swiffer, Dawn and Febreze, the latter getting a Super Bowl ad of its own for the first time this year. With Mr. Clean's TV spending estimated at under $23 million for the past year per iSpot.tv, one $5 million Super Bowl spot alone could chew up more than a fifth of the annual budget. So why take the risk? "We want to maximize the reach," Mr. Hettich said, citing Chief Brand Officer Marc Pritchard's discussions about the "the importance of broad reach and strong media plans." Mr. Clean muscled out P&G siblings for the Super Bowl slot in a creative contest among all the household cleaning brands that Mr. Hettich markets. Because Febreze also had strong creative from Grey, and a new product launch and brand restaging with its improved OdorClear technology, it also got the green light for a coveted spot in the game. "We were really impressed by what all the brands did," Mr. Hettich said. While Mr. Clean's Super Bowl ad doesn't back new products at this point, those will be coming later this year, according to Mr. Hettich. And besides that, he believes P&G hasn't invested enough in Mr. Clean over the past decade. So when the former North American home care marketing executive came back to the business in 2014 after years in Latin America, he decided to change that. Efforts also included introducing a contemporary version of the old Mr. Clean jingle this summer, which has been well received. Nielsen data from Deutsche Bank show P&G gained 0.7 points to reach a 7.3% share in Mr. Clean's $1.6 billion liquid cleaners category last year.

Is Tackling the E-Commerce Threat P&G recently provided some fresh data on how its online business is holding up against the competition. Demitrios Kalogeropoulos (TMFSigma) Jan 25, 2017 at 4:57PM Procter & Gamble's (NYSE:PG) dominance over the consumer goods industry is at risk as more spending moves online each year. The company doesn't enjoy the same wall-to-wall coverage online, after all, that it does in retail stores, where franchises like Tide and Pampers soak up prime real estate across shopping aisles. The good news for shareholders is that management is aware of the threats and opportunities that come with e-commerce disruptions. Despite recent stumbles as it tried to protect brands like Gillette from online-based rivals, P&G is optimistic that this important sales channel will be a win for the business over time. A $3 billion business E-commerce is now a $3 billion annual business for P&G, which equates to just under 5% of sales. A 40% annual growth rate is helping close the gap between that figure and the 8.4% of total retailing that is now taken up by online spending. E-commerce accounts for over 8% of all retailing, up from 3% in 2006. Image source: Federal Reserve Economic Data. P&G's key partners in this channel include Amazon.com, which competes in some of its strongest categories, and Target, in addition to Wal-Mart, whose retail locations account for 15% of its annual revenue. Holding market share P&G's market-share position online is about equal to its offline results. That means Pampers accounts for about 30% of all digital purchases of diapers around the world, Bounty makes up 40% of all paper towel orders, and the Gillette franchise is responsible for a whopping 65% of the global blades and razors industry. Image source: Getty Images. These products face brutal price-based competition from online-focused rivals, but in most cases their strong brands, supplemented by P&G's aggressive marketing spending, have allowed their retailing positions to translate directly into online dominance. Keeping costs even P&G is working hard to bring costs down to the point that it can generate the same profitability regardless of whether it's through an online sale or a traditional retailing purchase. The company has managed impressive wins on this score by cutting $1.5 billion out of annual operating expenses over the past five years. PG Cost of Goods Sold (TTM) data by YCharts. P&G expects to generate even bigger savings over the next few years by slicing an average of $2 billion out of annual costs through 2021. Winning markets Executives highlighted two markets where P&G is enjoying especially strong results online. In China that channel is on pace to reach 20% of its business and should soon pass $1 billion in annual sales. Website orders account for 40% of revenue in Korea, too, where P&G has had success pushing subscription services for high-volume products like diapers and razors. The company isn't likely to achieve anything close to these figures in the $28 billion U.S. segment. However, China is its second-largest market, and so it represents an attractive picture for the direction that its other key geographies should move. In its 10-K report, P&G lists "failure to effectively compete" in the e-commerce sales channel as one of its biggest operating risks. That concern will only grow as online sales pass 10% of overall retailing and keep climbing. Executives know there will always be a place for physical stores. They're more convenient for meeting needs quickly, or for shoppers aiming to handle errands, like gas refills, banking, and pharmacy trips, that aren't confined to product purchases. Yet P&G understands that it can't fall behind in a business that's already a huge sales generator in many of its most important markets.

In addition, the company’s projection on organic sales contained an upbeat tone. This positive news came at an awful time for the consumer staples space with most ETFs carrying a sell or strong sell rating. Let’s delve a little deeper and see if PG’s strong numbers can do any good to the sector. Procter & Gamble’s 2Q17 Earnings in Focus The consumer staple giant’s 2Q17 adjusted earnings of $1.08 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.06 by 1.9%. The bottom line also increased 3.8% from the prior-year quarter on higher margins. Currency-neutral core EPS improved 9%. P&G’s reported net sales of $16.86 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $16.8 billion by 0.3%. The top line, however, remained unchanged year over year. Foreign exchange had a negative impact of 2% on sales (read: ETFs & Stocks Unfazed by Softer December Retail Sales). Organically (excluding the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange), revenues grew 2% on the back of a 2% increase in organic volumes. All the five business segments recorded positive organic sales growth. Core gross margin expanded 70 bps to 51.5% as productivity cost savings and higher volume benefits were offset by headwinds like unfavorable mix and commodity cost increases. Management expects organic sales growth of about 2–3% compared with 2% projected earlier for fiscal 2017. However, the company now expects the combined foreign exchange headwind and minor brand divestitures to hurt sales by about 2–3% (predicted 1% earlier). Hence, P&G expects all-in sales growth to remain flat for fiscal 2017. Consumer ETF Impact Thanks to an upbeat earnings release, shares of PG notched up about 3.3% in the key trading session of January 20, 2017 on over two times higher trading volumes. The gain also reflected in the ETF world, with consumer staples funds being benefited moderately. Many of the key funds in this segment have a double-digit allocation to the consumer product giant, suggesting that the performance of the fund is highly dependent on P&G’s performance. Let’s take a look at the following three ETFs with a solid allocation to Procter & Gamble (read: Consumer Staples ETF Investing 101): Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund ((XLP – Free Report) ) The most popular consumer ETF on the market, XLP, follows the S&P Consumer Staples Select Sector Index. The fund invests about $8.29 billion of assets in 37 holdings. Of these firms, the in-focus P&G takes the first spot, making up roughly 13% of the assets. The fund has returned about 0.7% on January 20, 2017 (see all consumer staples ETFs here). Vanguard Consumer Staples ETF (VDC – Free Report) This fund manages a $4.0 billion asset base and provides exposure to a basket of 103 consumer stocks. The product charges a low fee of 10 bps per year from investors. Here too, P&G is the top firm with 10.5% allocation. VDC advanced about 0.6% on January 20, 2017. iShares U.S. Consumer Goods ETF (IYK – Free Report) This ETF tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Consumer Goods Index, giving investors exposure to the broad consumer staples space. The fund holds about 117 stocks in its basket with AUM of $542.3 million. Like the other two, the stock under consideration occupies the top position in the basket with 10.5% of assets. The fund gained over 0.7% on January 20. Bottom Line Even though PG had a favorable day, its impact on the rest of the consumer staples market wasn’t as solid as some might expect. Yes, all of the major consumer staples ETFs were up, but their gains were not profuse. After all, the wind is not in favor of the sector. With bond yields rising, its high-dividend appeal continues to fade. Consumer staples had a morbid good run in the last one month, but if PG’s outlook is any guide, the sector has still something to offer. However, to come to any conclusion, we need to keep a track on earnings of other staples giants (read: Consumer ETFs in Focus as Wal-Mart Misses Q3 Revenue). The Consumer Staples Select Sect. SPDR ETF (NYSE:XLP) was unchanged in premarket trading Wednesday. Year-to-date, XLP has gained 2.32%, versus a 1.82% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period. XLP currently has an ETF Daily News SMART Grade of A (Strong Buy), and is ranked #2 of 46 ETFs in the Consumer-Focused ETFs category. This article is brought to you courtesy of Zacks Research.

Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty Images Olivia Boyd Wednesday 25 January 2017 00.00 EST Last modified on Wednesday 25 January 2017 04.34 EST Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close Beaches strewn with plastic waste have become a graphic illustration of just how much plastic we use in everything from food packaging to cosmetics, and how much of it gets thrown away. Consumer goods giant P&G has become the latest company to attempt to show it is tackling the problem, announcing plans for a limited run of Head & Shoulders shampoo in bottles made partly from plastic waste collected by volunteers on France’s beaches. It follows the likes of Adidas, which put 7,000 pairs of trainers made from marine plastics on sale in November, and Pharrell Williams, whose clothing line for G-Star RAW has featured denim containing plastic from the oceans. Ecover, which sells cleaning products, has produced several limited edition bottles, using marine plastics from the North Sea and waste collected from Amsterdam’s canals. Saskia van Gendt, head of sustainability for Europe at Ecover, says it plans to launch new packaging later this year with plastic collected from UK beaches by environmental charity Surfers Against Sewage. Wooden surfboards to mushroom handplanes: the surf companies tackling ocean waste – gallery Read more P&G expects to manufacture up to 170,000 of their special edition bottle, produced in collaboration with recycling business TerraCycle and waste management firm Suez. That may be the biggest deployment of marine and beach plastic ever, according to TerraCycle CEO Tom Szaky, but it still represents less than 0.6% of the 29m bottles of Head & Shoulders P&G was reported in 2011 to be selling every year. However, Steve Morgan, technical director at plastics recycling network Recoup, says the level of recycled content in the beach plastic shampoo bottles – up to 25% according to P&G – makes the initiative a “technological breakthrough”, despite its limited size. “In the past when companies have tried to use plastics that have been sourced from oceans or beaches, it hasn’t been technically possible because of the exposure to UV, and also the plastics degrade and don’t recycle that well. What they’ve done here is make it technically viable, which is kind of the big thing,” says Morgan. That breakthrough – and its potential knock-on effects for recycling of challenging materials in general – is more significant than the origins of the waste plastic, says Morgan. “The bigger thing for me is the fact they’re using recycled plastic. Whether it’s from the oceans or not is kind of irrelevant.” “Once the technology is developed a bit more and economies of scale are made easier, it might become more mainstream,” he adds. Solutions to plastic waste Millions of tonnes of plastic are sent to landfill every year, and a large chunk of this ends up in the oceans: research suggests there could be more plastic than fish in the sea by 2050. Plastics production is expected to double in the next 20 years (pdf), but just 14% of plastic packaging is currently recycled globally, a figure that could be raised to 70% with concerted effort from industry, according to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation. Biodegradable plastic 'false solution' for ocean waste problem Read more Recycling may be a first step but if companies want to show real leadership they should shift to more circular economy business models, says Sophie Unwin, director of Scottish social enterprise Remade in Edinburgh. That means zero waste. “Innovations in product design are to be welcomed, but they mean little if the company is contributing to a trend of generating more waste overall,” says Unwin. Liz Goodwin, senior fellow and director of food loss and waste at the World Resources Institute, echoes this. While initiatives to remove plastics from the ocean are positive, she believes more needs to be done at an earlier stage: “In an ideal world we should be preventing waste plastic from going into the water in the first place and keeping waste plastic in use for as long as possible and recycling it.” This may require a more dramatic shift in approach – in the words of Ecover’s Van Gendt, “rethinking the bottle in general to something that’s much more closed loop”. Ecover, for example, is trying to encourage greater reuse with refillable cleaning products: “The most sustainable way to use a bottle is by refilling it multiple times,” she says. P&G has meanwhile pledged to boost its use of reycled content more broadly by using half a billion bottles made with 25% recycled plastic for European hair products by the end of 2018.

The initiative started in August 2016 with a viral video that showed the story of some girls and the challenges they faced. Girls between the ages 11 and 16 were invited to send in their essays about their dream careers and the challenges they face as girls. Of the over 2,000 entries received, 100 winners emerged. Speaking on the initiative, the Brand Marketing Director, Procter & Gamble Nigeria, Tolu Adedeji, said: “When the video was launched, we were overwhelmed with the response and support we received from everyone. It affirmed that starting up a conversation like the Always #MyFutureStartsToday could help build a girl’s confidence.” Following the competition, she said there would be a mentorship programme in partnership with the Women in Management, Business and Public Service (WIMBIZ), which will be organized for schools in Lagos and Abuja. She said girls in the schools would have the opportunity of being mentored, enlightened and inspired to achieve their potential. “There are so many challenges facing the girl child in Nigeria, as such, it is evident that girl education and mentorship will not only benefit the girls, it will also impact the whole society. The education of girls is important for us. In fact, Always advocates the empowerment of girls and women. In our bid to continue to contribute to Nigeria and Nigerian girls and women, we have launched this platform to reach more girls and help them to achieve their potential.” The Senior Brand Manager, P&G, Mokutima Ajileye, said: “The purpose for us is beyond just selling, rather it is to empower and advocate for girls and women. We have girls that tap into our category from age 11 and we do this globally in different ways depending on the market.” Ajileye explained that the brand wants to focus on education because once a girl-child is educated, other things would follow. “We know the struggles most girls face before being educated, like cultural barriers, which applies to the boys anyways. Hence, we decided to tackle financial barriers through essay contest among female students in secondary schools across the country for it to be based on merit.” Meanwhile, the founder of Bella Naija, Uche Pedro, who stressed the need for girls to reach their goals, said “we live in a world where girls are often told they cannot achieve certain feats simply because they are girls. That notion is wrong. I strongly believe that with confidence, a girl can achieve whatever she wants. This is why I joined Always in this campaign to help girls dream big and aspire towards their dreams.” The initiative was motivated by the result of a poll carried out by P&G, which revealed that 61 per cent of girls do not feel they have the right support to pursue their preferred career choice. It shows that girls face certain limitations when they decide to follow their dreams especially in developing societies. The organisation added that the MyFutureStartsToday campaign is working with women who have achieved success in their chosen careers, including Uche Pedro; Dr. Ola Orekunrin, the founder, Flying Doctors Nigeria; and Mercy Eghonghon, a professional Nigerian pilot who started flying at 17 and became a captain at 25.

Kathryn Hahn (Parks and Recreation, Happyish, Transparent) provides the voiceover, which begins, “I love you halftime bathroom break,” before explaining that viewers hold it in for fear of missing any of the “can’t miss football” and “must-see commercials.” There’s just one thing about those bathroom breaks, though: sometimes they stink. The spot will make its broadcast debut during the second quarter of the Super Bowl, as some viewers are undoubtedly anticipating that halftime bathroom break. P&G vice president, Home Care North America and brand franchise leader for Gobal Air Care Martin Hettich told Adweek that Febreze with OdorCare is Febreze’s  “toughest [odor-eliminating] formula to date” and its “largest product innovation since our inception nearly 18 years ago. “We have no pre-game jitters,” he added. “We are really excited for the work, and we think it will drive a head nod and laugh from the millions of game-watching fans who can relate to the halftime bathroom break.” The big game spot is part of a larger “Odor Odes” campaign. Another “Odor Odes” spot sees a man, who apparently named his dog “Gordo,” profess his love for something else that can get a little stinky: his couch.

More than three billion people live in the sprawling rural regions of Asia, Africa and other developing countries. Companies and governments cannot afford to ignore these consumers if they want to be successful, writes Vijay Mahajan in his recent book, Rise of Rural Consumers in Developing Countries: Harvesting 3 Billion Aspirations. Mahajan, a professor of marketing at the University of Texas at Austin, examines the main factors driving growth in rural markets, its major barriers, and how these can be overcome. In a conversation with Knowledge@Wharton, Mahajan notes that because of increased information flow thanks to rural migrants and communications technology, rural consumers have similar aspirations as their urban counterparts do. Still, there is a lot still left to understand about consumer behavior in rural areas, like family relationships and the importance of religious and social events. An edited transcript of the conversation follows. Knowledge@Wharton: What inspired you to write this book? Vijay Mahajan: When I was working on my last book The Arab World Unbound, it was the first time I had gone to 18 countries, including the Persian Gulf countries. I kept seeing the organizations and the infrastructure. And the moment I got out of the Gulf countries and went to Jordan and then to Egypt and Morocco, it hit me that I had missed a very important component of the developing countries. This was the fact that apart from the Gulf countries, the rest of the world was predominantly rural. I started talking to companies, especially in Egypt and in Morocco, about what the consequences are of the urban versus rural divide. Although I gained some data I really did not investigate much. I also realized that for my book titled The 86% Solution, as well as for Africa Rising, I had mostly gone to major urban centers because that’s where the headquarters are [of companies like] Coca-Cola and Unilever. They took me to all the major urban centers because they wanted to showcase what they were doing. When I came back and started looking at some other data, I realized this is a very major issue. India alone has a 70% rural population. The more I dug into that, I realized that almost half of the world’s population is non-urban. And interestingly, more than 3 billion people live in rural regions in Asia, Africa and the developing countries. What also surprised me was that even the U.S. was ninth in terms of the largest rural population. I started digging a little bit about the U.S. in terms of health care, education and so on. But then, I moved back to the developing countries and decided to focus on 10 of them. I realized that out of the 3 billion who live in Africa and Asia, 1 billion were just in South Asia — in Pakistan, Bangladesh, India and the small neighboring countries. Knowledge@Wharton: If you were to look at the 10 major rural markets you have identified in the book, what are the main factors driving their growth? “Rural aspirations are very much the same as in urban areas.” Mahajan: Three or four factors underlie their growth. One, there is a dedicated movement from the governments. I saw that with China, with Vietnam, with Thailand and also, to some extent, with India. Governments are trying to develop policies to help eradicate poverty. The second most important aspect I noticed was rural migration. All migrants from rural areas send money back home. But it’s not only the money; it’s also the impact [they create]. Many of them have gone outside the country – from India to the Middle East for example, as cooks, drivers and maids and they talk to their families back home on Skype, on mobile phones. So rural migrants are becoming major influencers in their villages and towns. Also, as compared to urban centers, rural centers are still very much into religion and culture and the most amazing things happen during the religious and social holidays like the Chinese New Year, Tet [New Year] in Vietnam or during Ramadan. Technology is also playing a major role in spreading information in farming, in health care, etc. So several factors are creating a lot of excitement, which I probably would not have seen 10 or 15 years ago. Knowledge@Wharton: When you talk to companies and chief marketing officers, have they tapped into the rise of rural consumers? Or is this an underserved market? Mahajan: Almost all the companies I met are aware that urban centers are saturated. They also know that urbanization is not going to happen overnight. India is where the U.S. used to be in the 1880s. China is where the U.S. was in the 1920s. It took the U.S. 90 years to get to this urbanization of 81%. Sponsored Content: I think companies are aware of the fact that governments would like to have urbanization, sometimes artificially. But the rural population is not going to go away. Unilever, for instance, simply cannot survive in South Asia if they ignore 1 billion rural people. Out of the 6 billion people in the developing countries, almost one-sixth or one-third are rural consumers. The companies know that this much population cannot be ignored and they have to find ways to approach them. I did see different strategies, for example, with P&G. But there’s also a lot of work that needs to be done to develop these markets. Some [companies] are doing better than others, but they are all fully aware that there is a huge market that cannot be ignored. Knowledge@Wharton: In addition to companies like Unilever and P&G, which other companies are furthest along in understanding the potential of rural markets? Mahajan: Mobile companies and entertainment companies have done well in understanding rural markets. [For example, in the entertainment sector] there is now a big wave to develop television shows based on rural centers and small towns, which also appeal to the urban population. There is a realization that there are a lot of aspirations in rural areas and we have to develop content around that. This point about aspirations in fact influenced the title of my book. Rural aspirations are very much the same as in urban areas. When you talk to the young people like drivers in Mumbai or construction workers in Shanghai, they are fully aware of the brands, which is a good brand, cost-wise, they are aware of all that. They send that information back home, thanks to mobile phones, Skype, FaceTime, etc. “Rural migrants are becoming major influencers in their villages and towns.” The information flow is very fast between urban and rural consumers. Also, there is satellite television — some countries are ahead of others in this area. I think they are different maybe because of their electricity [availability]. The Chinese are 100% electrified, which gives them a big advantage. Vietnam is trying to do the same. In India, electricity is an issue. Ethiopia has a major issue, Nigeria has a major issue. Knowledge@Wharton: You have a chapter on how technology can seed innovation that transforms rural markets. Could you offer some examples of how companies like FINO [a banking technology platform ] and financial services companies are using technology to gain access to rural consumers? Mahajan: In fact, this topic became so fascinating to me that I am now putting together my thoughts for my next book, which focuses only on this subject — digital leapfrogging and strategy in developing countries. Over the past two months I have been talking to a lot of people and everyone advised me to first go to the Western world — to first visit Estonia — because these people are actually providing everything digitally. What I saw there was that many of them are taking advantage of the lack of infrastructure — for instance, the radio channel created by Unilever. And there’s a story of an American girl from Stanford [University], who noticed the ‘missed call’ behavior in India and came up with the idea of pushing promotions [via missed calls]. Her firm was acquired by Twitter. There are also examples from health care. For instance, there’s a former professor from Arizona State [University] who has developed a testing kit via mobile technology for use in rural areas. There are also education initiatives, like the Stata Center at MIT which is doing work in Northeast India. In the cyber cities in China, what amazed me was how they are linked with Alibaba and others, and how through their platform a small farmer who has a very unique product is able to sell it to everybody. In entertainment, people can get songs, music, etc. on their mobile phones. So I think technology is going all across, in terms of promotions, providing services and providing information. Knowledge@Wharton: You also found that innovation and technology are being used to overcome social problems in rural markets. Could you share some examples of these? Mahajan: Absolutely. Some NGOs for instance are developing content for farmers — what to harvest, when to sell, what to buy and so on. Interestingly, they are spreading this information through entertainment — through movies that are very much like Bollywood movies but the subject is about using technology [to improve farming techniques]. There are actually several [movies] on social issues, all the way from women empowerment to hygiene. For example, on how important it is for women to wash their hands before they breastfeed their babies. In Ethiopia, the Gates Foundation has done an amazing job in linking farmers online through mobile. The farmers can get information about coffee prices, how the market is moving, about harvesting and so on. There are several social organizations that are using technology very creatively. Knowledge@Wharton: You end the book with a section on the five major barriers to the last mile. Could you identify what the barriers are to companies being able to tap into the potential of rural markets and how can they overcome these? “There’s a lot about consumer behavior, like family relationships, that needs to be understood.” Mahajan: I identified these barriers by reflecting on all the countries that I have listed [and then looking at issues like] why China is steps ahead of somebody else, why Vietnam is ahead of somebody else, why Thailand is ahead of somebody else. In China, for example, it was infrastructure that really hit me. So that became my one barrier for the rest of the countries — that they need to overcome their infrastructure problems. In the book, I focused on electricity because while these countries have many [infrastructure] issues, I was totally convinced that if they have to really pick one thing to solve, it has to be electricity. That’s because these days, you can talk about mobile phones and whatnot, but the fact of the matter is they have to be charged. You can talk about providing children education, but in the evenings if they don’t have electricity, they are going to be held back. You can talk about how the satellite TVs are available but if there is no electricity nothing is going to happen in these areas. So infrastructure became one barrier that I wanted to identify. Another thing that I noticed was social issues. There are many, many social issues but the one that really hit me was women empowerment. For example, in Vietnam, during surveys when women are asked, “What is your profession?” they don’t say “housewife.” They always have something to do. In Nigeria, you will find market ladies everywhere, the small entrepreneurs. In China, I saw the contribution that women are making, not only in education, but in every sector. So it was very obvious to me that women empowerment is very important. I started reflecting on what is going on in one country that is not going on in another country and how can they collectively move forward. That was the reason I suggested, that just like we have BRIC, we should also have a block of these 10 countries. And they should have a conference every year, like the global Consumer Electronics Show [in Las Vegas], where entrepreneurs from all over the world can come and showcase the innovations they have developed that can benefit developing countries and more specifically, the rural areas. The event could include firms from industries such as banking, education, entertainment, infrastructure, etc. We also have issues around health and education in rural areas. I think if these 10 countries can collectively focus on these five issues, they can really uplift the life of almost two-thirds of the world population. Knowledge@Wharton: What does the future look like for rural markets and rural consumers? Mahajan: If you talk to experts on urbanization, they all say that you cannot stop urbanization because it’s going to happen. Beijing, for example, is not the Beijing that I went to for the first time because it has simply expanded — they have a whole bunch of these areas developed around Beijing into a mega-city. So I think that urbanization probably would happen, and that is important to me. I think it is impacting consumer behavior. For example, in one of the very tiny villages that I visited in India I asked a farmer, “Do you have a TV?” He said, “Of course I have a TV.” I asked, “Do you have a car?” He said, “No, I have a truck.” “Do you have mobile phones?” “Of course, we have three mobile phones.” And then I asked, “Do you have a toilet?” He said, “Of course we have a toilet, what do you mean we don’t have a toilet?” And he pointed out the toilet to me. And then, after about 10 minutes, the conversation changed and he said, “I love my lifestyle here. It’s so free. I get up in the morning when everybody is asleep, I go to the farm, I relieve myself there, I talk to nature, then I come back home.” So then, I caught him. I said, “Sir, you just told me that you have a toilet and now you’re telling me that you don’t use that toilet, and that you go to the farm in the morning?” He knew that I had caught him. He said, “No, I can’t do that at home because it smells and it’s only for the ladies.” So I think there’s a lot about consumer behavior, like family relationships, that needs to be understood. Take the importance of the religious holidays or the importance of the harvest time. Many of the farm workers in Pakistan, for example, take off after the harvest season because that’s when they have the money. I think so long as there is some component of the agriculture sector, the entire lifestyle in rural areas will be around the harvest, the seasons, and many of the religious and social holidays. I don’t think that’s going to go away. In China, too, when I asked a construction company [head], “When do you lose most of your workers? He said, “First, during the Chinese New Year. Second, during the harvest time.” Many of these people just go back home. It doesn’t matter how small the fields are. So I don’t think that component is going to disappear — just like in the U.S., when you see the difference between the rural areas and the urban areas. Knowledge@Wharton: You also see this a lot in India. Domestic workers take off during the harvest season and go back to their villages. Mahajan: Absolutely. I saw this in every country. I saw that in China, I saw that in Bangkok. In Bangkok — many of these people come to Bangkok during the off season and become taxi drivers. And then, when it comes to harvest season, they all go back to help their families. The most interesting was in Indonesia. During the harvest season and also during Ramadan, they all go home. And the rich people move into hotels because there is no help. I could be wrong, but I don’t think that this lifestyle and consumer behavior will disappear. I think there’s always going to be some component of that. And even when you look at the numbers — for example, the Chinese are where the U.S. was in the 1920s, India is in 1880s — it’s hard for me to believe that they are going to be urbanized like the U.S., at least in my lifetime. I don’t think that’s going to happen.

By  Mikelle Street Credit: Getty Images It can be difficult to keep up with all of the advice on how to keep your skin healthy. Using a face wash and not a soap, for instance, or rubbing yourself down with activated charcoal to fix oily skin. Through all of that, though, showering stayed simple — pretty much the same since we started using showers. But that might be poised to change, too, with a move toward daily body exfoliation. Here’s how to know if it should be part of your morning routine. MORE: Earth-Friendly Exfoliators What is body exfoliation? First of all, the idea of exfoliation isn’t new. It’s “the use of either physical exfoliants, like crystals, or chemical exfoliants, like acids, to remove dead skin,” says Dr. Macrene Alexiades, a New York–based dermatologist. In other words, your body constantly makes new skin cells. Exfoliation is the process of clearing the dead ones away. When we clear dead skin away, it helps speed up how our skin renews, making us look more revitalized and healthier, says Dr. Marko Lens, a plastic surgeon who specializes in anti-aging treatments. After exfoliation, skin should appear brighter, softer, and healthier. Without exfoliation, dead cell buildup can make your skin look weathered and cracked, which makes sense: You’re basically wearing a suit of dead cells. When we talk about exfoliation, we’re usually referring to techniques for clearing dead skin from your lips, or from you feet or hands as during pedicures and manicures. In the past it’s been mostly marketed to women. But guy-centric salons are getting hip to the idea. Grooming Lounge’s services for men turns up treatments like the GL Signature Manicure, a foot treatment, and various types of facials, all of which include some sort of exfoliation. Some skincare companies have developed at-home exfoliation products, like Baxter of Califonia’s Exfoliating Body Bar, Menscience’s Buff Body Gloves, and, most recently, Procter & Gamble’s Duo. “[Our] team looked globally at things that people use to exfoliate their bodies when bathing — we looked at rags and netted puffs and even pumice stones, which are popular in China,” says Jamie Stahl, P&G principal scientist, about the Duo, which was rolled out in P&G brands Old Spice, Ivory, and Olay this month. “As we designed the Duo, we tried to find that perfect balance of exfoliating implements or texture that would allow the consumer to give the right pressure and the right angle of the little scrubbers.” Feet, hands, and lips aren’t the only places where you stack up a surplus of dead dermis. You can get a buildup on your elbows and knees, too. And for that, you need something more versatile than an exfoliating face scrub — which is where all of those exfoliating body scrubbers come into play. But even if products like the Duo are marketed for everyday use, that doesn’t necessarily mean daily exfoliation is right for you. ALSO: The 20 Best Grooming Gifts for Men “Men don't need to use any more than a washcloth or their hands over their face with a gentle wash,” says Dr. David Colbert, founder of the New York Dermatology Group. Doing much more than that could actually damage your skin. “By doing too much exfoliation, there is a risk that we remove good lipids from the skin and compromise a function of the skin barrier which is important to protect us from the environmental assaults.” Lens says. According to Stahl, this could look like redness, rough skin, or chafing after exfoliating. So what should I be doing? Like any good dermatologist will tell you, just pay attention to your skin. Exfoliating scrubbers, like a pumice stone or the rough side of the Duo, could irritate people with sensitive skin, leaving them feeling dry, stretched, or chafed. At the same time, maybe you just naturally grow a ton of skin and you constantly need to exfoliate. To each their own. If you have no idea how your skin will react, get something like the Duo that works on both types of skin. Add a Comment Sign Up for the Men's Journal Newsletter!

The Cincinnati-based consumer products giant, however, said it would appeal a National Advertising Division decision against other claims used to advertise its children's training pants. That appeal will be heard by the National Advertising Review Board, an appeals panel established by the industry to police advertising. P&G launched an updated and more absorbent version of its Easy Ups last year. Advertising claims made to promote the product included: "you'll see drier nights," "doesn't leak like ordinary training pants," "the best way to potty-train" and "the easiest way to underwear." Dallas-based Kimberly-Clark, which makes Huggies Pull-Ups training diapers, quickly cried foul. It argued to the regulatory body that P&G made claims it couldn't back. P&G voluntarily agreed to stop using the "you'll see drier nights" claim. However, it argued "doesn't leak like ordinary training pants" was modified in advertising with a clearly visible disclaimer that read: "versus the leading value brand, based on size 2T-3T." Kimberly-Clark said the disclaimer was not enough and that the first part of the claim could be interpreted by consumers to include its Huggies brand as well. The National Advertising Division agreed with Kimberly-Clark and P&G agreed to change the phrasing. The National Advertising Division also told P&G to stop using "the best way to potty-train" and "the easiest way to underwear" in advertising, saying the company could not support those claims. P&G defended those last two phrases as "puffery" – permitted advertising claims that are vague, highly subjective or unquantifiable. "P&G respectfully disagrees with NAD's determination that the phrase 'the easiest way to underwear' communicates an objective performance claim of 'faster' or 'easier' toilet training rather than non-actionable puffery, and will appeal this determination," P&G said in a statement attached to the National Advertising Division's decision. 3 CONNECTTWEET 1 LINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2kunBHE NEVER MISS OUT Managing Your Money Master your money with the latest business and investment news, articles and tips from financial experts each Friday.

Last Updated: 25 January 2017 Article by Paul Ranjard Wan Hui Da - Peksung IP Group Your LinkedIn Connections at Firm In 2014, the Supreme People's Court (SPC) circulated a draft and collected comments, after which the draft was significantly revised. This final version of the Provisions has been adopted at the 1703rd meeting of the Judicial Committee of the SPC on December 12, 2016 and will enter into effect on March 1, 2017. The Provisions brings very useful guidance for the Beijing IP Court (1st instance) and the Beijing High Court (2nd instance), in relation to appeals filed against decisions of the Trademark Review and Adjudication Board (TRAB). The 31 articles of these Provisions address a variety of situations, the main ones being related to "absolute grounds" of refusal, "relative grounds" of refusal, "bad faith" applications, other prior rights (copyright, name right etc.), the "use" of a trademark, and several procedural issues. The Provisions refers to the relevant articles of the Trademark Law (L. --- ) and to its own articles (Provisions --). Absolute grounds Prohibited signs (L.10) Regarding the use of State names (L. 10.1.1), the Provisions recommends to look at the trademark "as a whole". This means that even if a trademark contains the name of a State, if the mark is not, as a whole, similar to such name and if the registration of the mark would not be "detrimental to the national dignity", the mark may be registered (Provisions 3). The interpretation of the term "deceptive signs", in L. 10.1.7, may be made by reference to the same article of the 2001 version of the Trademark Law: "exaggeration and fraud in advertising". (Provisions 4). The expression "having other unhealthy influence" (L.10.1.8) refers to where the filing of a trademark has a "negative or adverse effect on China's public interests", which, for example, may be the result of the filing of the name of a public figure in the political, economic, cultural, religious, ethnic or other field" (Provisions 5). Geographical names (Chinese places above the County level or foreign places known to the public) are, in principle, prohibited under L.10.2. However, they may still be used if the sign, as a whole, has a meaning that allows distinction from the geographical name (Provisions 6). Distinctiveness (L.11) Signs that are the generic name of a product may not be registered as trademarks (L.11.1). However, the sign must be examined "as a whole". If the sign contains a descriptive element, while such element does not affect the distinctiveness of the sign, or if the descriptive sign is presented in a special manner so as to serve as a source identifier, the sign may be registered as a trademark (Provisions 7). In order to determine whether a sign is generic, the Court should verify if it is commonly perceived as such by the relevant public, and may refer to professional reference books, dictionaries etc. Such perception of the public may also be determined by reference to historical tradition, local customs and practices, geographical environment or other reasons. The Court should also consider the subjective knowledge of the applicant (who knows or should know that its trademark has become generic). Finally, the assessment should be made as of the time of filing of the application. However, if the situation has changed at the time of approval the court may base its decision on the time of registration. Where foreign language is used, it may happen that the foreign words have a descriptive inherent meaning, and should, in principle, be refused for registration as a trademark. However, if the relevant public is hardly aware of the meaning of such word, the mark may still function as a source identifier and be registered. (Provisions 8). Signs that are descriptive may not be registered as trademarks (L.11.2 ). This is the case for signs that merely or mainly describe the features etc. of the goods or services designated by the application. However, if the sign only insinuates the features of the goods... but does not affect its identifying function, the mark may be registered. 3D trademarks (L.12) The registration of such a sign remains very difficult. If, under most circumstances, the relevant public is not likely to take the sign as a source identifier, the mark may not be registered. Furthermore, the fact that the sign has been originally created by or firstly used by the applicant does not necessarily prove that it is distinctive. However, it is possible to rely on acquired distinctiveness through long term or extensive use (Provisions 9). Relative grounds Unregistered well-known trademark (L.13.2) The owner of an unregistered trademark may oppose or invalidate a litigious trademark by claiming that such trademark is a "duplication, imitation or translation" of its trademark, provided that the owner can prove that (1) its trademark, even though not registered in China, is well-known in China (L.13.2) and (2) that the registration of the litigious trademark is likely to cause confusion. For the determination of the likelihood of confusion, the Provisions enumerates the following factors to be considered by the Courts: The extent of similarity of the trademarks; The extent of similarity of the goods on which the trademarks are designated to be used; The extent of distinctiveness and reputation of the trademark that requests protection; The degree of attention of the relevant public; and Other pertinent factors. The Provisions make an additional comment to the above list: the "intention" of the applicant and the evidence of actual confusion may also be taken into consideration, but - and this has been specified by a judge of the SPC during a conference introducing the Provisions � the lack of evidence concerning the intentions of the applicant or any actual confusion will not have any negative impact. This article (Provisions 12) may be compared to the previous Opinions of the SPC, published in 2010 and 2011, where the SPC advised the Courts to take the reputation of both trademarks - the cited trademark and the litigious trademark � when assessing the similarity and the likelihood of confusion. This was called the "inclusive development theory". The theory seems to be abandoned. Registered well-known trademark (L.13.3) The Provisions, then, addresses the situation covered by L. 13.3: the owner of a registered well-known trademark opposes the application, or requests the invalidation, of an identical or similar trademark designating dissimilar goods or services (Provisions 13). Interestingly, however, the Provisions does not use the word dissimilar. It may be implied, though, but as we shall see when examining Provisions 14, this omission might be voluntary. The court is to examine whether the litigious trademark is likely to cause a certain degree of association, so as to mislead the public and harm the interests of the well-known trademark owner. Such examination is to be made by considering the following factors: The distinctiveness and extent of reputation of the Cited trademark; Whether the trademarks are sufficiently similar; The goods on which the trademarks are designated to be used; The extent of overlapping of the relevant public and the degree of attention thereof; Signs similar to the Cited trademark that are legitimately used by other market entities or other pertinent factors. Again, it may be noted that no reference is made to the reputation of the litigious trademark reputation, which confirms the abandonment of the "inclusive development theory". Provisions 25 introduces what appears to be the implementation of a ruling made by the SPC, on May 19, 2016, in the case P&G vs. TRAB and Weishida. In this case, P&G requested the invalidation of the Weishida trademark, more than five years after the registration date. Therefore, pursuant to article 41.2 (now renumbered 45.1) of the Trademark Law, P&G needed to prove that its trademark was well-known at the date of filing of the litigious trademark, and that the litigious trademark has been applied in bad faith. But another difficulty was to be overcome: the protection of a registered well-known trademark, as provided in the law (L.13), only applies to cases where the litigious trademark is used on dissimilar goods. In this case, the goods were identical. Yet, the SPC ruled that article 13 could apply even if the goods are identical. According to Provisions 14, if a party files an opposition of an invalidation action against a litigious trademark, claiming that its trademark is well-known, and the TRAB rules in favour of such claim on the basis of Article L.30 of the law (whereas such article concerns the protection of any trademark, even not well-known, against identical or similar trademarks designating identical or similar goods), the Court may apply Article L.30 if the trademark has been registered for less than 5 years, or apply Article L.13.3, if the trademark has been registered for more than five years. From this provision, it appears that the SPC agrees that a trademark owner may invoke Article 13.3 (in addition to article L.30) even when the litigious trademark is applied or registered for identical or similar goods. Indeed, if Article L.13.3 can be applied, after the 5 years, to a litigious trademark that would have been refused or invalidated pursuant to Article L.30 (within 5 years), it is obvious that the "dissimilar goods" condition is no longer required for the application of such Article 13.3. Unregistered trademark with a certain influence (L.32) If the opponent or invalidation applicant cannot prove that his trademark is well-known, it is still possible to successfully oppose, or invalidate, a trademark that has been applied or registered "preemptively by unfair means" (L.32). The owner of the cited trademark must prove that the trademark has been used in China and has acquired a certain influence, and must also address the "unfair means" issue. Here, the Provisions brings some assistance (Provisions 23): if the applicant of the litigious trademark definitely knew or should have known of the existence of the prior trademark, this may be presumed to constitute pre-emptive registration by unfair means, unless the applicant adduces evidence to prove that he has no bad faith in exploiting the reputation of the prior used trademark". So, provided sufficient of prior use is adduced, the SPC considers that the burden of proof should be reversed onto the litigious trademark applicant. Regarding the evidence proving a certain influence, the Provisions give examples such as continuous use for a certain period of time of a certain geographical coverage. And, to be perfectly clear, the Provisions adds that article L.32 only applies to trademarks filed on identical or similar goods or services. Other prior rights, copyright, name right etc. (L.32) If the prior right cited under L.32 is another civil right, such right must be valid not only before the date of the litigious trademark application but also at the time of the approval of the trademark (Provisions 18). Provisions 19 to 22 stipulate details explaining how to prove the ownership of copyright and the conditions for obtaining protection of the name, of a pseudonym, of a trade name, of a character image. Bad faith Provisions 15 and 16 provide details concerning the interpretation of L. 15.1 and L.15.2. For example, the terms agent or representative used in L.15.1 should be construed widely as including any kind of intermediary in the sense of sales agency, and should include persons having a kin or any specific relationship with such agent, and even if negotiation have taken place without being concluded. Likewise, the term "other relations" used in L.15.2 covers a wide range of circumstances (family relationship, labour relation, business location in the proximity, un-concluded negotiations). Finally, Provisions 25 deals with another aspect of article L.45.1 which is the "bad faith registration" of the litigious trademark. Here, the SPC introduces two new ideas. First, the Court should examine, not only, the intentions of the litigious trademark applicant (at the time of filing), but also, the status of use of the litigious trademark, which implies to consider facts that occurred after the date of filing. This is also the application of the abovementioned ruling on P&G vs. TRAB and Weishida. And secondly, where the reputation of the cited trademark is high, the Court may presume that the litigious trademark as filed in bad faith, unless the applicant can prove proper cause for such filing. This is the same reversal of the burden of proof as provided in Provisions 23. Use of a trademark (L.49.2) Provisions 26 clarifies the conditions for the revocation based on 3 year non-use, as stipulated in L.49.2. For example, if the used trademark has only a subtle difference with the registered trademark, this constitutes valid use. Showing the intent to use through necessary preparation may serve as a "proper reason" for the mark not to be (yet) in use. On the other hand, the mere fact of signing an assignment of license agreement, in the absence of actual use, is insufficient. Procedural issues Finally, the Provisions contain a few articles (Provisions 2 and Provisions 27 to 30) that address procedural technicalities. Provision 2 stipulates that, the court may, ex officio, raise a legal ground that a plaintiff had not raised in the administrative litigation, in order to rectify a decision that appears obviously inappropriate. Provision 28 clarifies a situation that occurs very frequently: (i) a trademark is refused on account of a prior right, (ii) the applicant files a review with the TRAB and at the same time a procedure against such prior right, but the procedure is still pending when the TRAB makes its ruling (which confirms the refusal). Then, the case is referred to the Court. The Provisions stipulate that, if the prior right obstacle has been removed ("new facts"), the Court may order the TRAB to re-make its decision (even though such decision was correct at the time).

Don’t deny it: You’re sitting there at home in your kitchen, looking at that messy stain from last night’s chicken cacciatore, and thinking to yourself, “God, using cleaning products really makes me want to get my fuck on. Isn’t there a company whose chemical burn also fires up my loins?” Baby, just relax and let Mr. Clean take over. Forget those old live-action versions of a human male you could conceivably have actual intercourse with, sweet thing, and set aside that weird spot from three months ago where Kellan Lutz ”auditioned” to be the new spokescleaner. In a new Super Bowl ad that’s already making panties wet on YouTube, the longstanding symbol of Proctor & Gamble’s foray into cartoon human mascots representing all-purpose cleaners is reminding you ladies just how much mopping floors makes you want to enter the bone zone. Oh yeah, just look at those tight CGI-rendered buns, thrusting back and forth as he slides that cleaning stick all up in your hardwood floors. Is it getting hot in here? Then better not watch him slowly wipe himself across your glass shower door, a moment sure to shoot right to the top of the Hentai search results in every cartoon porn website. It even ends with a command, not a request: “You gotta love a man who cleans.” So just tape a picture of that gleaming animated scalp to your headboard, or possibly make your man wear a paper bag over his head with bona fide sex panther Clean’s face affixed to it, and take the freshly scrubbed train to pound town, because this call to heterosexual capitalist purchasing power is ready for some hot wet action.

We’ll go beyond natural resources like air and water to look at how efficiency in raw materials can boost the bottom line and help the environment. We’ll also examine the circular economy and design for reuse — with an eye toward honoring those resources we do have. Sponsored by Sealed Air Sustainability at Home and Beyond While changes at home can’t solve the many environmental crises we face today, they can sure help. Through this series, we’ll explore how initiatives like curbside compost pick-up, rebates on compost bins, and efficient appliances can help families reduce their impact without breaking the bank. Sponsored by Whirlpool Corporation Social Impacts in Apparel Despite decades -- centuries even -- of global efforts, slavery can still be found not just on the high seas, but around the world and throughout various supply chains. Through this series on forced labor, sponsored by C&A Foundation, we’ll explore many different types of bonded and forced labor and highlight industries where this practice is alive and well today. Sponsored by C&A Foundation Black Lives Matter and Beyond In this series we examine how companies should respond to national controversy like police violence and the BLM movement to best support employees and how can companies work to improve equality by increasing diversity in their ranks directly.

IBM set a greenhouse gas emission reduction goal in 1998. Johnson & Johnson set one in 2000 and invested in its first solar project a year later. But a lot has changed since those early days.  What began as a vocal minority is now a loud and steady chorus. Today, companies realize there is real money to be saved by embracing energy efficiency and reducing emissions. By investing in renewable energy, corporations can lock in cheaper energy prices and reduce the risk of market volatility. These economic benefits of investing in renewables and greening their operations and supply chains have made companies active leaders in the U.S. climate movement. Regardless of the incoming administration’s position on climate change, American corporations’ significant renewable energy and efficiency goals are essential in America’s ability to meet and beat our domestic climate pledges. Nearly half of America’s Fortune 500 companies have set climate or renewable energy goals. And now we’re seeing the scale of their corporate targets become more aggressive. Thirty-five U.S. companies, including P&G, Walmart, PepsiCo and Hewlett Packard Enterprise have either set or committed to set science-based renewable energy and emissions targets aligned with the path recommended at the international climate talks. And more and more companies are pledging to power their operations with 100 percent renewable energy. There’s another growing trend afoot: U.S. companies are more willing to exert their considerable influence to demand policy change to safeguard prosperity. Two weeks ago, over 700 companies reaffirmed their support for a low-carbon United States and for the historic Paris Climate Agreement. The diversity of companies that signed the statement, in addition to those making ambitious science-based targets and renewable energy commitments, shows businesses backing climate action isn’t just a trend among Silicon Valley tech companies and consumer-facing brands. Some of America’s biggest-name manufacturers and retailers are pushing the envelope. But, with all these companies moving to meet ambitious climate targets, corporate buyers will need greater access to renewable energy from the grid and greater choice in offerings from utility providers. It’s why corporate buyers outlined their priorities for utilities, utility regulators and the renewable energy marketplace in an open statement. Sixty-five companies now support the Corporate Renewable Energy Buyers’ Principles, including PepsiCo and TD Bank that came on board this week. Collectively, these 65 companies are seeking enough renewable energy equivalent to powering 4.4 million American homes. Business investments in a clean-energy future may be driven by the bottom line, but they comprise a critical piece of a larger shift in the world. Sharply declining prices of wind and solar energy have converged with a global scientific consensus on the perils of a warming planet. This convergence is pushing climate action forward with irreversible momentum. Now it’s up to all of us – from corporations to states, cities and civil society – to help accelerate this transformation by demonstrating our vocal and visible support for action and illuminating a clear business case for developing an American economy focused on a low-carbon future: one that is powered by clean and renewable energy sources. If we can do that, we will provide Americans with new jobs and homegrown industries, more secure and healthier communities, and a more stable climate.

Published on January 26, 2017. Most Popular Sergio Alcocer, one of the best-known U.S. Hispanic creative directors, is launching an agency called Rest of the World, in a return to the ad industry following the end of his non-compete agreement with Omnicom Group. Sergio Alcocer Mr. Alcocer left Omnicom-backed LatinWorks at the end of October 2015 after 16 years at the Hispanic shop where he was president and chief creative officer. "I always wanted to keep doing advertising, and multicultural advertising is what I love," he said. "Rest of the World is a multicultural mission. I want to bring Latin-inspired creative to the mainstream." The agency's logo is a harmonious palette of skin tones, representing America's diversity. Mr. Alcocer describes Rest of the World as "an agency founded in and for the Trump era." "For the next four years companies and brands will need to take a social stance—do you embrace multicultural marketing, or consider it a threat," he said. "I think people will favor brands that embrace their beliefs. I'm planning an agency deeply rooted in today's culture, but acknowledging that today's culture is deeply divided, rather than living in a marketing world that ignores what's happening on the street." Credit: Rest of the World Mr. Alcocer said he is starting the agency in Austin, where he lives and was based with LatinWorks, and that he envisions an office with not more than 10 or 15 people, and a network of collaborators. "I'm in conversations with a couple of more senior people to join me as partners," he said. He is also setting up "strategic alliances" for Rest of the World; two so far are with PR and social media agency Boden in Miami, and a Latin American company called Bitacora Social started by former Procter & Gamble executive Othon Garcia that does deep dive social research for senior decision makers. Mr. Alcocer said he is designing an agency to be competitive in 2017 and work well on a project basis. "Agencies have struggled with technology and social change, and fast-paced clients," he said. "Bureaucracy kills creativity. I want an agency that's very horizontal and flexible, an agency of strategists, planners, and content providers. It will be very collaborative, not just with clients but with agency networks." There has been widespread speculation about what Mr. Alcocer would do next after his enforced sabbatical year. He said he has traveled a lot with his wife, as the year outside the industry coincided with the couple becoming "almost" empty nesters, and continued to work on a PhD in Latino studies he's been pursuing at the University of Texas "to complement my practical experience of marketing to Latinos in the U.S. with an academic framework." During his 16 years at LatinWorks, Mr. Alcocer was behind creative that sweeps award shows, like the long-running Cine Las Americas campaign for a Latin American film festival, and brand-building work for major marketers, and has been a judge twice at the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity. Under his creative leadership, LatinWorks was named to Ad Age's Agency A-List of the best U.S. agencies and has been Ad Age's Multicultural Agency of the Year more than once. During his year away from the industry, there were many "Sergio spottings" as industry execs saw him or heard about his travels to Cuba, to South by Southwest, and even a vinyl record store he owns in Mexico City. (Mashable named Discos Mono, with a collection curated personally by Mr. Alcocer, one of 12 unique record stores around the globe). As he starts Rest of the World, Mr. Alcocer said he was inspired by "The New Colossus" poem on the Statue of Liberty's pedestal, which includes the famous lines "Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free." In marketing terms, he sees it as an invitation to the table. "There's a lot of talent that's waiting for the opportunity to shine that's lost in the ranks of general market agencies," he said. "I want Rest of the World to be the place they do the best work of their lives. Strangely I think the next four years will see a boom in multicultural. There's no longer a space in the middle." So far he's been working on a couple small projects, including a campaign to promote U.S. tourism to Mexico's Baja California region and an effort to launch Mexican sports brand Voit in the U.S. soon, and is involved in a few pitches. (The agency's website RestoftheWorld.Agency will go live early next week). "I'm very excited about going back to square one, in every sense," he said.

The Motley Fool Published 11:45 a.m. ET Jan. 25, 2017 | Updated 8:52 p.m. ET Jan. 25, 2017 CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share The Dow Jones industrial average closed above 20,000 points for the first time, the latest milestone in a record-setting drive for the stock market. (Jan. 25) AP Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange as the Dow Jones Industrial Average crossed over the 20,000 mark for the first time after at the opening bell. (Photo: Andrew Gombert, EPA) The Dow is the most recognized stock index in the U.S., but what is it? The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), often referred to as the "Dow Jones" or simply as "the Dow," is a price-weighted average of the stocks of 30 large American publicly traded companies. Created by Charles Dow in 1896, it is the most well-known U.S. stock index and is used to gauge the market's performance from day to day. What is a price-weighted index? In a nutshell, a price-weighted index means that higher-priced stocks have more influence over the index's performance than lower-priced ones. Consider a fictional index made up of just three stocks, with share prices of $10, $30, and $60. Since the highest-priced stock makes up 60% of the total combined value of the three, a 10% gain in that stock's price would raise the index by 6%. In contrast, a 10% gain in the lowest-priced stock would only result in a 1% rise in the index. In the case of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the prices of all 30 stocks in the index are added together and then divided by the "Dow divisor," which changes over time due to stock splits and other events. The divisor is much less than one, which is why the value of the index is greater than the sum of the stock prices. The current "Dow 30" As of the most recent adjustments, which went into effect after the market's close on March 18, 2015, here are the 30 stocks that currently make up the DJIA, listed in alphabetical order. 3M American Express Apple Boeing Caterpillar Chevron Cisco Systems Coca-Cola E I du Pont de Nemours ExxonMobil General Electric Goldman Sachs Home Depot IBM Intel Johnson & Johnson JPMorgan Chase McDonald's Merck Microsoft Nike Pfizer Procter & Gamble Travelers UnitedHealth Group United Technologies Verizon Visa Wal-Mart Walt Disney It's worth noting that these components change frequently. Apple, Goldman Sachs, Nike, and Visa have all been added to the index within the past three years. Also, only one of the Dow's original 12 components (General Electric) from 1896 remains on the index today. Drawbacks of the DJIA Although it's the top number you see when you look at any stock market coverage, there are some shortcomings to the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Most obviously, the Dow Jones only includes 30 stocks. There are more than 5,300 common stocks that trade on the NYSE and Nasdaq, so the Dow 30's performance may not be the best indicator of how the overall market is doing. Also, the price-weighting means that some of the Dow components have much more influence on the index than others. For example, as of this writing, Goldman Sachs trades for about $235 per share, while Pfizer trades for just $31. Therefore a move in Goldman Sachs' share price would have more than four times the effect of a similar (percentagewise) move in Pfizer. For these reasons, the broader and market-cap-weighted S&P 500 is widely accepted as a better indicator of how the stocks of large U.S. corporations are performing.

CBS Television Even Chuckles the Clown is mourning this sad day. Actress Mary Tyler Moore – who starred in two iconic TV series, and produced many shows including “WKRP in Cincinnati” – died Wednesday at age 80. Ted Knight, Ed Asner and Mary Tyler Moore in 1977. Credit CBS Television Her break-though role was playing the wife on the “Dick Van Dyke Show” (1961-66) sponsored by Procter & Gamble the first season. In 1970, she turned our world on with a smile as unmarried career TV newswoman Mary Richards in the “Mary Tyler Moore Show” (1970-77), one of the greatest TV sitcoms ever. Moore surrounded herself with an excellent cast, including gruff Ed Asner (“You’ve got spunk. I hate spunk”), Ted Knight as the airhead anchorman and Betty White as the snarky “Happy Homemaker.” They were all there at the funeral for TV station co-worker “Chuckles the Clown” on Oct. 25, 1975, when Mary couldn’t stop laughing as the minister repeated Chuckles’ familiar phrase: “A little song, a little dance, a little seltzer down your pants.” The “Chuckles Bites The Dust” episode was ranked No. 1 on TV Guide’s “100 Greatest Episodes Of All Time” list in 1997. Moore and her husband Grant Tinker, later an NBC Entertainment executive, produced “Mary Tyler Moore” through their MTM Enterprises, along with “The Bob Newhart Show” (1972-1978), “Rhoda” (1974-1978), “Phyllis” (1975-1977), “The Tony Randall Show” (1976-1978), “Lou Grant” (1977-1982), “Betty White Show” (1977-1978), “WKRP” (1978-1982), “Hill Street Blues” (1981-1987), “St. Elsewhere” (1982-1988), “Newhart” (1982-1990)” and dozens of other shows.

Credit CBS Television Moore, who was diagnosed as a diabetic in her 30s, also was nominated for an Academy Award for her dramatic role in “Ordinary People” in 1981. Her film credits included “Six Weeks,” “Just Between Friends,” “Thoroughly Modern Millie” and “Change of Habit” with Elvis Presley. She also starred in several short-lived TV comebacks: “Mary,” ‘Annie McGuire,” “New York News” and the “Mary Tyler Moore Hour” variety show in 1979 -- with young sidekicks David Letterman and Michael Keaton. She knew how to turn the world on with a smile. Thanks for all the laughs. And Chuckles too.

After his historic debut as a 15-year-old in 1944, Nuxhall returned to the Reds in 1952 at age 23. He won 83 games for in the club in the 1950s – going 12-5 in 1954 and 17-12 in 1955. He led the National League with 5 shutouts in 1955, and made the All-Star teams in 1955 and 1956. Then he fell apart in 1960 with a 1-8 record and 4.42 ERA at age 32. Enjoy 'Dick Van Dyke Show' Sunday, Which P&G Almost Killed By John Kiesewetter • Dec 8, 2016 CBS Television If Procter & Gamble had its way, the "Dick Van Dyke Show" being celebrated by CBS in prime-time Sunday would never have aired. P&G, the sponsor for the first "Dick Van Dyke" season (1961-62), pulled the plug on advertising  a second season of the Dick Van Dyke-Mary Tyler Moore comedy after it finished No. 80.

By Alan Tovey 6:27 AM Thursday Jan 26, 2017 SHARE: Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Not saved Email Print Markets United States Sponsor message.   Video will play in Play now Don't auto play Never auto play What's happening? The Dow Jones Industrial average has hit the psychologically important 20,000 mark, having repeatedly tested this level in the run-up to Christmas and consistently hit record highs. What is the Dow Jones? It's a price-weighted index of 30 of the largest and/or most important publicly traded companies in the US. Invented by Charles Dow in 1896, it acts as a proxy for the wider health of the US economy. What's so important about the 20,000 level? In many ways, nothing - it's just a number that relates to performance. However, to humans trading shares, rather than computer algorithms, it represents a significant marker. It's a "resistance level" that can be difficult to break through for human dealers who often trade on fears.But we've got here. How? Myriad factors. 1. President Trump Perhaps the most important one is President Donald Trump. There was a degree of nervousness ahead of the US election but once the bombshell result had been digested, investors decided that Trump would be good for business, and particularly some of the companies that are Dow members. 2. Industry's likely to be stronger Continued below. Related Content Donald Trump's White House press secretary Sean Spicer: 'One way or another Mexico will pay for wall' China touted as TPP partner after US move Video Watch: Dow Jones industrial average crosses 20,000 Trump has pledged to strengthen US manufacturing and bring work home, bolstering companies such as Caterpillar, which is up more than a third in the year to date, and United Technologies, 15 per cent stronger. Other big winners are 3M and IBM, both about a fifth more valuable. Nasdaq Tower in New York's Times Square, as the display shows that the Dow Jones industrial average crossed the 20,000 mark for the first time. Photo / AP Trump's tweeted threats about the repercussions for US companies which elected to offshore work caused some consternation, but did have the effect of least encouraging some high-profile names to bring work home or invest in domestic production facilities. Companies with big manufacturing operations such as Johnson & Johnson and Procter & Gamble have also soared, as their prospects are closely linked to economic growth. There's also been the promise to rebuild the US's worn-down infrastructure, which will generate jobs and in turn boost economic growth domestically. Today, Trump is expected to sign legislation promising to build his controversial wall on the US-Mexico border, a massive infrastructure project which will deliver a huge lift to construction and building materials businesses. 3. A shot in the arm for pharma businesses Drug companies also surged immediately after the election, on the belief that Trump would support a free market in healthcare and a potential roll-back of the controversial Obamacare, though the president-elect has since tempered this enthusiasm, saying: "I'm going to bring down drug prices... I don't like what's happened to drug prices." Still, companies in the sector such as United Health and Merck have risen by almost 40 per cent and 20 per cent respectively. 4. Banks are in the money The real stock market darlings are in the banking sector, which has surged on the prospect of lighter regulation. As the Dow neared the 20,000 mark just before Christmas, analysts calculated that investment in Goldman Sachs, up 34 per cent in the year to date, was responsible for 419 points of the index's rise since the start of the year. Rival JP Morgan wasn't far behind, with its shares rising a hair less than 30 per cent in the year to date. Higher interest rates - Fed chair Janet Yellen has already hiked once and signalled two or three more rises to come - have also helped, as banks perform better when rates are higher as they can charge more for loans. Specialist Frank Masiello wears a Dow 20,000 cap as he works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. Photo / AP 5. Oiling the wheels Trump's Cabinet appointments also send a loud signal that his administration could be good for big business. Most notable is ExxonMobil boss Rex Tillerson as secretary of state - it's no wonder that Dow constituent Exxon is a major gainer over the year, rising 16pc, though this is far behind Chevron, which is up more than 30 per cent. 6. A cabinet of billionaires Other big business names will be joining Trump in the White House. Investor and former banker Wilbur Ross - who has an estimated fortune of US$2.5 billion - is slated to be secretary of commerce. The nomination for army secretary is Vinnie Viola, the founder of trading firm Virtu Financial; he's estimated to be worth US$1.8b. Other leading business figures in Trump's cabinet include a former Goldman COO. There's a lot of bad things going on, though - why is the Dow rising? Despite terrorist attacks, markets have proven surprisingly resilient, shrugging off fears. It seems that there's a newfound confidence in the air. Anything else driving this? Well, there's the traditional Santa rally that took place before Christmas which set up the Dow to get to the 20,000 mark. As the year ends, shares tend to rise. There are many theories about what drives it, from dealers clearing up trades for the end of the year, people investing bonuses, and just general seasonal good cheer driving stocks higher. Whatever the reason, it held true at the end of 2016, and set up the Dow for a winning start to 2017. - Daily Telegraph UK By Alan Tovey Email Print Get the news delivered straight to your inbox Receive the day’s news, sport and entertainment in our daily email newsletter SIGN UP NOW Loading Currency Compare and convert world currencies.

Toolkit 2017 explores the issues raised by Procter & Gamble's decision last year to cut back on targeted advertising on Facebook. (Non-subscribers can download a sample of this Toolkit chapter here.) Global Brand Building Officer, Marc Pritchard, revealed that its Tide detergent brand had increased media reach by 10% to 20% in the US by shifting to more broadly appealing television shows and higher-reach digital platforms. But reaching the masses and targeting with precision do not have to be mutually exclusive events, according to Julie Coleman, Manager, Deloitte Digital, who suggests three things for marketers to consider. First, does the brand have well defined customer journeys, with carefully sequenced messaging throughout? It might use TV for premium-impact messaging at scale, then follow this up with a digital campaign, supporting awareness over a longer period of time and broadening the audience, or using pockets of targeting to make the message bespoke to relevant high value or impact groups. Second, with so much focus on 'audience', a brand should ensure it is not overlooking the value of 'context' – there may be higher value to a campaign if an ad can be shown in a premium context where the user is dwelling longer on the page. Third, a brand should consider how it might combine mass reach and precision targeting to move beyond brand recognition into positive brand sentiment, as Coca-Cola has done by putting names on bottles. The Toolkit also observes that as budgets shift towards digital, brands are increasingly adopting a short-term outlook, in part simply because short-term metrics are common in the digital space. Marketing consultant Peter Field has conducted research in this area and concluded: "The inevitable result of short-term measurement is a drift to strategies that deliver better in the short term. These deliver poorer long-term performance and so short-termism ultimately undermines long-term effectiveness." Field's work with Les Binet further suggests that, while the optimum ratio of brand-building to activation work is 60:40, in recent years advertisers have begun to spend considerably more than 40% of their budgets on activation.

Demitrios Kalogeropoulos (TMFSigma) Jan 24, 2017 at 6:25PM Kimberly-Clark (NYSE:KMB) posted fourth-quarter results on Tuesday that met executives' low sales growth expectations while modestly outperforming on the bottom line. The owner of Kleenex and Huggies consumer brands also paired a weak forecast for the 2017 fiscal year with a solid boost to its quarterly dividend. Here's how the big-picture results stacked up against the prior-year period.  Metric Q4 2016 Actuals Q4 2015 Actuals Growth (YOY) Revenue $4.5 billion $4.5 billion N/A Net income $505 million $333 billion 52% EPS $1.40 $0.91 54% Data source: Kimberly-Clark financial filings. Weak sales, steady profits Organic sales growth clocked in at 1%, which was a slight improvement over the prior quarter's flat result. The gains were split evenly between developing and emerging markets and were driven by modest volume growth. The revenue figure met management's forecast, but only after the team had lowered its outlook in the prior two successive quarters. Kimberly-Clark began the year targeting 5% organic growth to match 2015's result but finished with just a 2% increase. Rival Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) outpaced Kimberly-Clark for the second straight quarter by announcing a 2% gain last week. Image source: Kimberly-Clark. Kimberly-Clark's bottom line benefited from aggressive cost-cutting that pushed gross profit up 3% to $1.7 billion despite the flat revenue figure. The company also reduced overall expenses by 4% so that adjusted earnings rose by a healthy 5%. The 50% spike in reported profit came from an unusually low earnings result in a prior-year period that included major restructuring charges. Management's focus Executives were pleased that Kimberly-Clark could defend its brands despite a weakening consumer products industry and increased pricing pressure from rivals. "While we experienced a challenging economic and competitive environment," CEO Thomas Falk said in a press release, "our market share positions remained broadly healthy." "We also achieved record cost savings, which helped us improve our margins and deliver earnings in line with our guidance for the year," Falk continued. "We generated strong cash flow and returned $2.1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases." Looking ahead Management isn't optimistic about the coming year. Whereas Procter & Gamble raised its sales outlook to 2.5% (which would be its highest result on that metric in three years), Kimberly-Clark sees little chance of quickly bouncing back toward 2015's 5% growth pace. Instead, the company forecast another year of weak gains. Executives see organic growth averaging 2% in 2017. "We will execute our global business plan strategies in what we expect will be a continued difficult environment," Falk explained. The business plan might not deliver market-beating sales growth, but investors can still expect to see plenty of improvements on finances as costs trend lower and as Kimberly-Clark wrings more efficiency out of its global infrastructure. After all, operating cash flow jumped 40% over the last 12 months to over $3 billion. More success there should help protect earnings growth while providing funds for steady cash returns to shareholders. The past year's $2.1 billion of capital return spending matched 2015's result despite a 2% drop in reported revenue. Kimberly-Clark expects to direct roughly $1 billion toward capital improvements this year while spending the same amount on stock repurchases. Its dividend payment will rise by 5.4%, giving it a rare win against P&G, which most recently disappointed income investors with just a 1% boost to its quarterly payout.

And it’s true — while study results vary regarding whether men who do more housework also enjoy more sex with their partners, the prospect of half of the American population chipping in to help the other half (women, who remain the chief target of ads for cleaning products) with some scrubbing and mopping is always very welcome. Mr. Clean’s high-profile new TV spot, produced by Leo Burnett, Toronto, hits on this fact, as well another low-key truth: Some people find the bald, musclebound two-dimensional marketing icon sexy as hell. Seriously, it’s a thing. Which is why putting Procter & Gamble’s 59-year-old mascot in a pair of skintight white jeans to match the shirt stretching across his computer-generated pecs was probably inevitable. Watch Mr. Clean’s new Super Bowl ad, in which a housewife fantasizes that her husband is actually the cloud-browed stud, above. Mr. Clean’s appeal made me wonder if he was the only crush worthy male animated character; a cursory Google search reveals dozens of listicles about sexy female cartoons like this one from CinemaBlend, yet only the heroes over at World of Wonder have a list of hot male toons. Before I found that, though, I crowdsourced Team PopCrush for internal answers, in a VERY professional and respectful way: But once we got the ball rolling, it was truly a safe space for dialogue. Kind of. The ad wizards at Leo Burnett are really onto something.

New Delhi: Limited role for Railway Board, revamping of HR functions, and switch over to commercial accounting of railway functions are some of the recommendations made by the Debroy Committee in its interim report to Railways on Wednesday. The high-level committee headed by economist Vivek Debroy, who is a NITI Aayog Member now, was constituted six months ago to suggest ways for restructuring of the Railway Board and revamping the public transporter into a financial viable organisation. According to sources, the committee in its interim report has also suggested rationalisation of zones and divisions; decentralisation of power to general managers and DRMs. The panel has also taken note of an estimate of the Railways' financial needs and suggested appropriate framework and policies to raise resources, both internally and from outside the government. Among others, the mandate of the committee included reorganising and restructuring the board and subsequently the department to separate policy making from operations and encourage inter-departmental coordination. Other members of the panel include former Cabinet secretary KM Chandrasekhar; Gurcharan Das, former chairman and managing director of Procter and Gamble; Partha Mukopadhyay, senior fellow, Centre for Policy Research; Ravi Narain, former managing director of the National Stock Exchange among others. The committee was also asked to recommend steps to mobilise resources for major projects and help set up a Rail Tariff Authority. Currently, Railways works on a top-down hierarchical model with a six-member Railway Board which implements and monitors policies and takes all key decisions.

Skip to content Military Technologies pr@satprnews.com HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Main Menu Virtualitics Launches as First Platform to Merge Artificial Intelligence, Big Data and Virtual/Augmented Reality 26 January 2017Military News PASADENA, Calif.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Virtualitics, LLC, a data analytics in virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) startup, today announced the launch of its new tool that combines powerful data visualization in VR/AR and artificial intelligence to provide insights and discover actionable knowledge hidden in big and complex data. The company also announced they closed a $3 million investment seed round from angel investors. Virtualitics combines VR/AR with machine learning and natural language in a data exploration, collaborative environment suitable for both data scientists and non-expert users. The technology is the only one of its kind that can provide a simultaneous rendering of up to 10 dimensions, revealing multidimensional relationships present in the data, which may not be discoverable in any other way. The company is based on over a decade of research at Caltech and NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and was founded by: professor George Djorgovski, the founding director of Caltech’s Center for Data-Driven Discovery; Michael Amori, former Deutsche Bank managing director, Harvard MBA and Caltech alumnus; Dr. Ciro Donalek, computational scientist at Caltech; and Dr. Scott Davidoff, manager of the Human Interfaces Group at NASA’s JPL. “Big Data is worthless if we cannot extract actionable knowledge from it,” said Michael Amori, CEO of Virtualitics. “Visualization can reveal the knowledge hidden in data, but traditional 2-D and 3-D data visualizations are inadequate for large and complex data sets. Our solution is to visualize as many as 10 dimensions in VR/AR all via a Shared Virtual Office, which allows even untrained users to spot patterns in data that can give companies a competitive edge.” Dr. Donalek, CTO of Virtualitics and a machine learning and VR expert added: “In recent years, machine learning has helped to solve complex scientific and business problems; adding VR and immersive collaborative environments will increase even further our ability to understand data.” According to professor Djorgovski, renowned astrophysicist and a pioneer in the uses of VR as a scientific platform: “VR is intrinsically well-suited for human perception, intuition and pattern recognition, leading to insights that may be difficult or even impossible to gain through any traditional visualization technique. It is a natural environment for collaborative visual data exploration and data analytics that enables teams of users, who may be continents apart, to interact with the data and with each other in a shared virtual space. It may also be a natural environment where humans can interact with their artificial intelligence assistants.” “We’ve long noted the benefits of VR/AR for some of the most complex initiatives we’ve undertaken at NASA,” said Dr. Davidoff, a leading expert in AR and manager of the team that created a “Virtual Mars” for NASA. “This technology also has the potential to change the way the business world thinks about, views and harnesses the potential of Big Data.” Virtualitics board of advisors includes: Andy Walter, former global vice president, IT for Procter & Gamble; Jerry del Missier, former COO of Barclays Bank; Alexander Lidow, CEO and co-founder of Efficient Power Conversion (EPC); Henry Ritchotte, former COO of Deutsche Bank; Paul Fox, vice president, strategic initiatives for Procter & Gamble; Henry Hsu, board member of a Taiwanese accelerator; and Andy Wilson, Pasadena City Councilman and tech entrepreneur. “Companies around the world are struggling to harness the power of Big and Small, but complex, Data. They are also investing heavily in key talent, analysts and data scientists, because they want to provide the best tools to collaborate and identify patterns that will impact the bottom line,” said Andy Walter, strategic advisor to Virtualitics. “Virtualitics has been able to create the virtual office of the future, which will allow even the largest, most complex global companies to easily find and share patterns that could significantly improve the way they do business.” Virtualitics is currently in private beta.

Demitrios Kalogeropoulos (TMFSigma) Jan 26, 2017 at 11:37AM Magnum ice cream production. Image source: Unilever. Unilever (NYSE:UL) on Thursday posted earnings results for its fourth quarter and full fiscal year. The consumer goods giant met its broad growth targets yet warned about weakening demand trends in some of its biggest markets. Let's take a look at the key figures from the report. What happened this quarter? Organic growth was 2.6% for the quarter to place overall growth at 3.7% for the year, within management's goal of between a 3% and 5% improvement. Highlights of the quarter include: Sales growth slowed to its weakest pace in over a year as the business was pinched by a range of negative market trends. Global economic growth slipped and a few individual markets, including Brazil and India, endured significant disruptions. Unilever's organic gains came entirely from higher prices as volume declined for the second straight quarter. However, its growth pace kept it just ahead of the overall market and beat rivals Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) and Kimberly-Clark (NYSE:KMB), which recently posted 2% and 1% growth, respectively. Core operating margin ticked higher despite significant currency devaluation in Turkey, the United Kingdom, and Egypt. Earnings improved by 3% for the full year as a 7% operational gain was pulled lower by 4% due to exchange rate shifts. Return on invested capital fell by a full percentage point to 18% of sales. Profitability gains and working capital improvements were more than offset by increasing goodwill charges stemming from Unilever's recent acquisitions, including its $1 billion purchase of Dollar Shave Club. What management had to say Executives described weakening demand trends around the world. "Market conditions have been challenging throughout the year, and particularly so in the fourth quarter," they explained in a prepared statement. "In a number of countries, volumes have been weak as consumers and retailers adjust to devaluation-led cost increases," they continued, and cited Brazil and India as prime examples. Image source: Unilever investor presentation. Still, the company managed to boost profitability and organic revenue even as two of its largest markets struggled. "This further demonstrates the progress we have made in transforming Unilever into a more resilient business," CEO Paul Polman said. "We have again grown ahead of our markets, driven by strong innovations that support our category strategies," he said. Looking forward Polman and his team are predicting that the tough market conditions that characterized this most recent quarter will continue at least through the first half of 2017. That sentiment was echoed by Kimberly-Clark, which earlier in the week warned of near zero growth for the next six months. Unilever still expects to outpace rivals against that unfavorable market backdrop, though. P&G is looking for 2.5% organic gains this year and Kimberly-Clark's latest forecast calls for a 2% increase. Unilever should see closer to 3% growth, which would indicate minor market share expansion. The clearest sign that demand conditions are improving will likely come from a volume rebound, and so investors should watch that figure closely for signs of gains. In the meantime, cost cuts will keep profitability churning higher so that the company has the financial ammunition to direct toward product innovations and marketing support, with plenty left over for increased capital returns to shareholders in the form of a steadily climbing dividend.

The Dow closed at 20,068.51, up 0.78 percent, while the S&P 500 finished up 0.80 percent at 2,298.37 and the Nasdaq climbed 0.99 percent to finish at 5,656.34. The new milestone for the Dow occurred shortly after the market opening. It came just over three and a half years after that index cracked 15,000 for the first time and just under 18 years after it first moved above 10,000 in 1999. It was the second Dow milestone since the current president of the United States was elected on Nov. 8, with the 19,000-point mark threshold having been eclipsed on Nov. 22. The stock market got an initial post-election boost and has surged higher in recent days since Donald Trump, who this week said he would make good on promises to cut taxes across-the-board and slash regulations, was inaugurated on Jan. 20. Of the 30 large-cap companies that make up the Dow, The Boeing Company was the biggest gainer on Wednesday, climbing 4.2 percent thanks to a strong earnings report. Other Dow components that moved higher during the session were Caterpillar and Apple, which closed up 1.98 percent and 1.57 percent, respectively. The Procter & Gamble Company sustained the days biggest loss among Dow stocks, falling 0.80 percent. Trump sent out a brief tweet after the Dow climbed above 20,000 points, simply saying, Great! A high-ranking assistant of the presidents, Kellyanne Conway, also took to Twitter after the news, calling the new milestone The Trump Effect.   Enter your email address to subscribe to free headlines (and great cartoons so every email has a happy ending!) from the Latin American Herald Tribune:   RSS Feed [ Home ] [ About Us ] [ Who's Who ] [ Contacts ] [ Help ] Copyright Latin American Herald Tribune - 2005-2015 © All rights reserved

A tissue of truths Printed human body parts could soon be available for transplant How to build organs from scratch Jan 28th 2017 Add this article to your reading list by clicking this button Tweet Aye, aye! What’s this ear? EVERY year about 120,000 organs, mostly kidneys, are transplanted from one human being to another. Sometimes the donor is a living volunteer. Usually, though, he or she is the victim of an accident, stroke, heart attack or similar sudden event that has terminated the life of an otherwise healthy individual. But a lack of suitable donors, particularly as cars get safer and first-aid becomes more effective, means the supply of such organs is limited. Many people therefore die waiting for a transplant. That has led researchers to study the question of how to build organs from scratch. One promising approach is to print them. Lots of things are made these days by three-dimensional printing, and there seems no reason why body parts should not be among them. As yet, such “bioprinting” remains largely experimental. But bioprinted tissue is already being sold for drug testing, and the first transplantable tissues are expected to be ready for use in a few years’ time. In this section Searching for particles on a benchtop Mediocre academic researchers should be wary of globalisation A computer program that learns how to save fuel Printed human body parts could soon be available for transplant Reprints Related topics Technology Biotechnology Science and technology Just press “print” Bioprinting originated in the early 2000s, when it was discovered that living cells could be sprayed through the nozzles of inkjet printers without damaging them. Today, using multiple print heads to squirt out different cell types, along with polymers that help keep the structure in shape, it is possible to deposit layer upon layer of cells that will bind together and grow into living, functional tissue. Researchers in various places are tinkering with kidney and liver tissue, skin, bones and cartilage, as well as the networks of blood vessels needed to keep body parts alive. They have implanted printed ears, bones and muscles into animals, and watched these integrate properly with their hosts. Last year a group at Northwestern University, in Chicago, even printed working prosthetic ovaries for mice. The recipients were able to conceive and give birth with the aid of these artificial organs. No one is yet talking of printing gonads for people. But blood vessels are a different matter. Sichuan Revotek, a biotechnology company based in Chengdu, China, has successfully implanted a printed section of artery into a monkey. This is the first step in trials of a technique intended for use in humans. Similarly, Organovo, a firm in San Diego, announced in December that it had transplanted printed human-liver tissue into mice, and that this tissue had survived and worked. Organovo hopes, within three to five years, to develop this procedure into a treatment for chronic liver failure and for inborn errors of metabolism in young children. The market for such treatments in America alone, the firm estimates, is worth more than $3bn a year. Johnson & Johnson, a large American health-care company, is so convinced that bioprinting will transform parts of medical practice that it has formed several alliances with interested academics and biotechnology firms. One of these alliances, with Tissue Regeneration Systems, a firm in Michigan, is intended to develop implants for the treatment of defects in broken bones. Another, with Aspect, a biotechnology company in Canada, is trying to work out how to print parts of the human knee known as the meniscuses. These are crescent-shaped cartilage pads that separate the femur from the tibia, and act as shock absorbers between these two bones—a role that causes huge wear and tear, which sometimes requires surgical intervention. More immediately, bioprinting can help with the development and testing of other sorts of treatments. Organovo already offers kidney and liver tissue for screening potential drugs for efficacy and safety. If this takes off it will please animal-rights activists, as it should cut down on the number of animal trials. It will please drug companies, too, since the tissue being tested is human, so the results obtained should be more reliable than ones from tests on other species. With similar motives in mind, L’Oréal, a French cosmetics firm, Procter & Gamble, an American consumer-goods company, and BASF, a German chemical concern, are working on printing human skin. They propose to use it to test their products for adverse reactions. L’Oréal already grows about five square metres of skin a year using older and slower technology. Bioprinting will permit it to grow much more, and also allow different skin types and textures to be printed. Skin in the game Printed skin might eventually be employed for grafts—repairing burns and ulcers. Plans are also afoot, as it were, to print skin directly onto the surface of the body. Renovacare, a firm in Pennsylvania, has developed a gun that will spray skin stem cells directly onto the wounds of burns victims. (Stem cells are cells that proliferate to produce all of the cell types that a tissue is composed of.) The suggestion is that the stem cells in question will come from the patient himself, meaning that there is no risk of his immune system rejecting the new tissue. The real prize of all this effort would be to be able to print entire organs. For kidneys, Roots Analysis, a medical-technology consultancy, reckons that should be possible in about six years’ time. Livers, which have a natural tendency to regenerate anyway, should also arrive reasonably soon. Hearts, with their complex internal geometries, will take longer. In all cases, though, printed organs would mean that those awaiting transplants have to wait neither for the altruism of another nor the death of a stranger to provide the means to save their own lives.

BUSINESS COMPANY TOWN After riding a wave of growth in Latino consumers, this ad agency's job just got harder Ad agency Christina House / For The Times From left, Hector and Norma Orci with their son Andrew, the company's CEO, at the Orci office in Santa Monica. From left, Hector and Norma Orci with their son Andrew, the company's CEO, at the Orci office in Santa Monica. (Christina House / For The Times) Meg JamesContact Reporter When the U.S. government wanted to encourage millions of undocumented immigrants to step out of the shadows and become citizens, it turned to a start-up advertising firm in Los Angeles to create the campaign. The year was 1986. Since then, the family-owned Orcí Agency has ridden the wave of huge growth in the U.S. Latino population, and a rising recognition among marketers of their economic importance. But last year, as the pioneering agency celebrated its 30th anniversary, chants of “build the wall” punctuated campaign rallies for President Donald Trump. On Wednesday, Trump ordered federal workers to begin construction on the barrier along the Mexican border. The juxtaposition has been jarring for Hector Orcí, a Mexican American who co-founded the agency, now based in Santa Monica. He and other advertising executives are worried that such divisive rhetoric denigrates Latinos, and could prompt a retreat in marketing to a vital segment of the country. “There is a rejection of multiculturalism,” Orcí said. “Latino consumers feel betrayed, they have been cast as the enemy. There is a tremendous need, and opportunity, for marketers to reconnect with Latino consumers.” His firm has spent three decades helping corporate clients, including American Honda Motor Co., Union Bank and Dole, to understand nuances of Latino culture and to create advertising that would inspire brand loyalty. Over the years, the agency has encountered scattered rejection from other corporations that didn’t want to be seen as appealing to Latinos out of fears that such outreach could alienate white consumers.  “We’ve dealt with it before, and we will continue to deal with it,” Orcí said. “What’s changed is there now is a permission to be nasty to us.”  Trump’s comments about Mexicans and Muslims, and the election results have sparked debate within advertising circles about how best to navigate cultural divisions that have deepened. “This election was a wake-up call,” said David R. Morse, president of New American Dimensions, an Orange County advertising research firm. Latino consumers feel betrayed, they have been cast as the enemy. — Hector Orcí, agency cofounder Communities are deeply divided, Morse said, and marketers should do more to understand various segments of the population. He noted that Trump received more votes — including more Latino votes — than many analysts had predicted.  “There is a huge sector — millions of people — out there who feel ignored when they turn on the television,” Morse said. “Some feel resentment by what they see as an over-representation of minorities in advertising.… But the answer is not to ignore minorities.” The debate comes amid a trying time for the advertising industry. The media landscape is fragmented, and consumers are using technology to skip commercials, making it more difficult for advertisers to engage them. After a wave of consolidation, a handful of large holding companies dominate the business, squeezing out smaller shops. Independent firms were swallowed up or closed during the Great Recession as corporations cut back on ad spending. Ad behemoths have discouraged their clients from seeking the expertise of a specialty firm like Orcí. The agency, which would not disclose its finances, was stung several years ago by the loss of a major client, Verizon. Orcí employs about 40 people, down from a peak of 120 about a decade ago, but it remains one of the largest independently-owned Latino marketing agencies nationwide. Multicultural advertising has faced another challenge: Increasingly, growth in the Latino community is coming from the children and grandchildren of immigrants who are typically fluent in English and not reliant on Spanish-language outlets. The demographic shift has prompted some advertisers to put less emphasis on targeting Latinos and instead focus on homogeneous messages. “We have to restate our mission because our mission is very important,” said Andrew Orcí, 45, the agency’s chief executive and the second generation of leadership. “Our job is to give voice to Latino consumers.” Hector Orcí, now 74, was 15 when he came to Los Angeles from his native Sonora, Mexico. He graduated from John Marshall High School, was elected student body president at Los Angeles City College, and is a graduate of USC and the Fletcher School at Tufts University, where he received a master’s degree in economics. His first job in advertising was with the Cincinnati consumer products giant Procter & Gamble, working on its Duncan Hines and Crisco brands. He ran the ad firm DDB in Mexico, before he and his wife, Norma, returned to the U.S. to join another agency, McCann, to market Coca-Cola — and new Coke — to Latinos. The Orcís ran the group within McCann that created Spanish-language ads. “There was a reluctance among some advertisers to get into Hispanic or multicultural advertising, but there also were some very smart clients, like Coca-Cola, that pushed it,” Hector Orcí said. “They realized that if you ignore the Latino market, then you are ignoring a lot of money.” He and his wife opened La Agencia de Orcí & Asociados on Wilshire Boulevard in West Los Angeles in 1986. Norma Orcí was the creative force; she devised the concept “share of heart” — a play on the industry’s fascination with market share — to reinforce that the best commercials speak to a consumer’s passion. The firm beat out more established agencies for the U.S. Immigration & Naturalization Service account in 1986 to spread the word about the immigration reform law, signed by President Reagan, and how immigrants could apply for citizenship. Nearly 3 million immigrants responded. Last year, archivists with the Smithsonian’s National Museum of American History collected the agency’s work papers for inclusion in its archives in Washington. Orcí donated the painting that served as a centerpiece of the firm’s 1986 citizenship campaign. The image depicts five multicultural faces protected by the wings of a bald eagle. An image showing five multicultural faces protected by the wings of a bald eagle was designed by the Orcís for a campaign they did in 1986 for the U.S. Immigration & Naturalization Service account.

(La Agencia de Orcí­ & Asociados) The intent was to show that people “like us — people who looked different” were welcome in the U.S., Hector Orcí said. But tensions lingered. “In the ‘80s, there was a resistance among marketers to learning a new culture, learning a new language and learning new forms of media,” said Norma Orcí. “We are facing a similar situation now.”  Although resentment of Latinos and other minorities continues among some audiences, there are dramatic differences, too. An estimated 40% of younger adults — the millennial generation — are from diverse backgrounds. The agency has tried to adapt. “We’ve evolved together,” said Gina Jorge, head of multicultural marketing for American Honda, one of Orcí’s longtime clients. Orcí no longer exclusively creates commercials for Spanish-language audiences. It provides its clients with behavioral insights about Latinos, regardless of language. “We have had creative [commercials] that were born with Latino insights that played so well that we made them into English-language spots,” Honda’s Jorge said. She pointed to a commercial the firm produced about a man who buys a Honda Ridgeline pickup — and family members suddenly find a need for his new vehicle. “Everyone goes to him for help because he is the one with a truck,” she explained. “As a Hispanic, it is very ingrained that you help each other.” The goal is for commercial messages to transcend cultural divisions. The strategy has been working for Orcí, which has had an upswing in business in recent years. In 2016, the value of its accounts (known in the industry as gross billings) topped $60 million, up from $55 million in 2014. “We are very optimistic. This is a very rich society because of its ability to integrate other cultures into it,” said Hector Orcí. “Of course there is always resistance. We are struggling to help the resistance not resist so much.” Caption Kristen Stewart on directing 'Come Swim' Kristen Stewart enjoyed the free-form aspect of making her short film, "Come Swim" which is showing at the Sundance Film Festival.

Sometimes the donor is a living volunteer. Usually, though, he or she is the victim of an accident, stroke, heart attack or similar sudden event that has terminated the life of an otherwise healthy individual. But a lack of suitable donors, particularly as cars get safer and first-aid becomes more effective, means the supply of such organs is limited. Many people therefore die waiting for a transplant. That has led researchers to study the question of how to build organs from scratch. One promising approach is to print them. Lots of things are made these days by three-dimensional printing, and there seems no reason why body parts should not be among them. As yet, such “bioprinting” remains largely experimental. But bioprinted tissue is already being sold for drug testing, and the first transplantable tissues are expected to be ready for use in a few years’ time. Just press “print” Bioprinting originated in the early 2000s, when it was discovered that living cells could be sprayed through the nozzles of inkjet printers without damaging them. Today, using multiple print heads to squirt out different cell types, along with polymers that help keep the structure in shape, it is possible to deposit layer upon layer of cells that will bind together and grow into living, functional tissue. Researchers in various places are tinkering with kidney and liver tissue, skin, bones and cartilage, as well as the networks of blood vessels needed to keep body parts alive. They have implanted printed ears, bones and muscles into animals, and watched these integrate properly with their hosts. Last year a group at Northwestern University, in Chicago, even printed working prosthetic ovaries for mice. The recipients were able to conceive and give birth with the aid of these artificial organs. No one is yet talking of printing gonads for people. But blood vessels are a different matter. Sichuan Revotek, a biotechnology company based in Chengdu, China, has successfully implanted a printed section of artery into a monkey. This is the first step in trials of a technique intended for use in humans. Similarly, Organovo, a firm in San Diego, announced in December that it had transplanted printed human-liver tissue into mice, and that this tissue had survived and worked. Organovo hopes, within three to five years, to develop this procedure into a treatment for chronic liver failure and for inborn errors of metabolism in young children. The market for such treatments in America alone, the firm estimates, is worth more than $3bn a year. Johnson & Johnson, a large American health-care company, is so convinced that bioprinting will transform parts of medical practice that it has formed several alliances with interested academics and biotechnology firms. One of these alliances, with Tissue Regeneration Systems, a firm in Michigan, is intended to develop implants for the treatment of defects in broken bones. Another, with Aspect, a biotechnology company in Canada, is trying to work out how to print parts of the human knee known as the meniscuses. These are crescent-shaped cartilage pads that separate the femur from the tibia, and act as shock absorbers between these two bones—a role that causes huge wear and tear, which sometimes requires surgical intervention. More immediately, bioprinting can help with the development and testing of other sorts of treatments. Organovo already offers kidney and liver tissue for screening potential drugs for efficacy and safety. If this takes off it will please animal-rights activists, as it should cut down on the number of animal trials. It will please drug companies, too, since the tissue being tested is human, so the results obtained should be more reliable than ones from tests on other species. With similar motives in mind, L’Oréal, a French cosmetics firm, Procter & Gamble, an American consumer-goods company, and BASF, a German chemical concern, are working on printing human skin. They propose to use it to test their products for adverse reactions. L’Oréal already grows about five square metres of skin a year using older and slower technology. Bioprinting will permit it to grow much more, and also allow different skin types and textures to be printed. Skin in the game Printed skin might eventually be employed for grafts—repairing burns and ulcers. Plans are also afoot, as it were, to print skin directly onto the surface of the body. Renovacare, a firm in Pennsylvania, has developed a gun that will spray skin stem cells directly onto the wounds of burns victims. (Stem cells are cells that proliferate to produce all of the cell types that a tissue is composed of.) The suggestion is that the stem cells in question will come from the patient himself, meaning that there is no risk of his immune system rejecting the new tissue. The real prize of all this effort would be to be able to print entire organs. For kidneys, Roots Analysis, a medical-technology consultancy, reckons that should be possible in about six years’ time. Livers, which have a natural tendency to regenerate anyway, should also arrive reasonably soon. Hearts, with their complex internal geometries, will take longer. In all cases, though, printed organs would mean that those awaiting transplants have to wait neither for the altruism of another nor the death of a stranger to provide the means to save their own lives.

WSJ's Sue Shellenbarger and Tanya Rivero discuss how employees can use humor to their benefit. Photo: iStock By Sue Shellenbarger Sue Shellenbarger The Wall Street Journal BiographySue Shellenbarger Google+ Sue.Shellenbarger@wsj.com Jan. 24, 2017 10:51 a.m. ET 16 COMMENTS Colleagues who make others laugh are seen as more self-confident, competent and higher in status, according to a series of experiments by researchers at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School and Harvard Business School. This conclusion, compelling for the many people who have spent on clothes, cars, credentials or coaching to burnish their image, has gotten some understandable attention recently. Laughs are a risky path to prestige, however: Tell just one inappropriate joke and your status among peers hits the skids. Humor is often seen as a sign of intelligence, and delivering a joke well requires sensitivity to others’ moods and tastes. John Thorne often uses self-deprecating humor to elevate his employees’ status among clients. As president of Automotive Events, a Cleveland-based producer of car-related promotions, he’s often the one who wins new clients. But when he introduces them to the employees who will be organizing and running their events, he jokes, “I don’t actually do anything. It’s these guys who do the work,” he says. When clients laugh, he says, “No seriously, I don’t do anything all day. I’m just here to make sure the coffee is pouring.” The gambit helps clients feel better about the transition to working with someone else, he says. Telling jokes can make leaders be seen as more confident and competent, but it also can bring executives down to employees’ level, making them seem more human and vulnerable, says Clayton Fletcher, a comedy consultant with Peppercomm, a strategic communications firm in New York City, who has coached Mr. Thorne. Past research has shown the value of workplace humor in easing stress, building rapport and increasing the productivity and creativity of teams. Sources: T. B. Bitterly and M. Schweitzer, The Wharton School The Wharton study is the first to assess the impact of joking on an individual’s status at work. Researchers asked a total of 2,300 participants in eight experiments to observe mock ad testimonials, view illustrated job interview transcripts and recall jokes told by co-workers. Participants rated each joke-teller’s status based on such criteria as how respected, powerful, admired and influential the person was likely to be in colleagues’ eyes. Simply recalling a funny joke by a co-worker elevated the joke-teller’s status in participants’ minds, says T. Bradford Bitterly, a doctoral candidate at Wharton and lead author on the study, published in November in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology. “It shows how powerful humor can potentially be,” he says. Twenty-two-year-old Daniel Monarres of San Antonio believes his ability to poke fun at himself during an interview helped him win a slot in a highly competitive graduate program at Texas A&M University’s Mays Business School in College Station, Texas. When the interviewer asked about his hobbies and whether he played golf, Mr. Monarres admitted that he didn’t, then quipped that he served as trainer to his two college roommates, both expert golfers who played on the university team. The interviewer laughed and the conversation ended on a warm note, he says. Related Coverage Why Telling a Joke Pays Off for the Boss How to Build Instant Rapport in an Interview Secrets of Effective Office Humor Effective humor can trigger abrupt changes in people’s image. A soft-spoken introvert who “out of nowhere, in a deadpan manner, delivers a line that is super-funny,” can rocket to greater influence among co-workers, says Bob Kulhan, founder of Business Improv, a Chicago consulting firm, and author of “Getting to ‘Yes, And,’ ” a new book about using comedic skills at work. There’s plenty of joking going on in the workplace, and a lot of it is missing the target. While all but 1 of 200 participants surveyed by the Wharton researchers could recall a joke told by a co-worker, they rated nearly one-third of the jokes as inappropriate. There’s no risk to your reputation in telling an appropriate joke, even if it flops and no one laughs, the Wharton study shows. You’ll still be seen as confident. Sources: T. B. Bitterly and M. Schweitzer, The Wharton School Telling an inappropriate joke, however, can do serious damage. Participants in another Wharton study assessed the status of three job seekers who were asked in a simulated interview to suggest a creative use for an old tire. One drew a laugh by saying, “Someone doing CrossFit could use it for 30 minutes, then tell you about it forever.” The second made an inappropriate joke about turning the tire into condoms, and the third gave a serious response: “Make a tire swing out of it.” Participants rated the first joker highest in status, the serious respondent second and the applicant who made the off-color joke last. Figuring out whether a joke will fly requires deciding whether it meshes with the setting, listeners’ tastes and their purpose at the moment, says Andrew Tarvin, a New York City workplace humor coach and author who has taught comedy techniques to employees at Procter & Gamble, PricewaterhouseCoopers, GlaxoSmithKline and other companies. A joke can work even in a somber situation if it relieves tension. A wisecrack can flop badly, however, if the joker disregards listeners’ emotions: A CEO who jokes after a round of layoffs that he’s going to have to get a smaller yacht is likely to come across as aggressive and mean, says Mr. Tarvin. And spouting one-liners in a meeting where participants are intent on solving a complex problem isn’t likely to accomplish much more than annoying people. Work & Family Mailbox Q: Your column on what parents of teenage boys need to know was very helpful. What is the impact of kids’ heavy use of social media during such a fragile developmental period?—T.M. A: There’s some evidence linking social-media use to declines in children’s social skills and empathy. Preteens who spent five days at an overnight nature camp with no access to television, computers or mobile phones showed significant gains in their ability to read unspoken emotional cues in others’ faces, based on test scores before and after the camp session, according to a 2014 study led by researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles. The campers’ scores rose more than scores of a control group of preteens who remained at school with their usual screen time. College students’ scores on a broader measure of empathy have fallen since 2000, according to a 30-year research review students’ responses to a standardized empathy scale. The results are based on students’ agreement with such statements as, “I often have tender, concerned feelings for people less fortunate than me,” and, “I sometimes try to understand my friends better by imagining how things look from their perspective.” Write to Sue Shellenbarger at sue.shellenbarger@wsj.com Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Most Popular Videos Trump Emphasizes Close Relationship With U.K. A Real-Life Alexa Lives With 'Alexa' Ferris Bueller 'Oh Yeah' Song Helps Co-Creator Earn Millions Goldman: 2 Stock Picks; How to Play Bonds Oscar Schafer's 3 Values in a Pricey Market Most Popular Articles Opinion: Trump Tries to Build a ‘Different Party’ Opinion: Trump’s Little Mexican War Miami-Dade Mayor Orders Jails to Comply With Trump Immigration Plan Opinion: Chuck Schumer Goes Wild Opinion: A GOP Regulatory Game Changer SHOW COMMENTS HIDE COMMENTS (16) Failed to load comments Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Trump Emphasizes Close Relationship With U.K. A Real-Life Alexa Lives With 'Alexa' Ferris Bueller 'Oh Yeah' Song Helps Co-Creator Earn Millions Goldman: 2 Stock Picks; How to Play Bonds Oscar Schafer's 3 Values in a Pricey Market Most Popular Articles Opinion: Trump Tries to Build a ‘Different Party’ Opinion: Trump’s Little Mexican War Miami-Dade Mayor Orders Jails to Comply With Trump Immigration Plan Opinion: Chuck Schumer Goes Wild Opinion: A GOP Regulatory Game Changer Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India América Latina Brasil 中国 (China) 日本 (Japan) Edition: U.S. Asia Europe India América Latina Brasil 中国 (China) 日本 (Japan) Text Size: Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP« WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

The spokesperson said the prime minister was officially invited by World Economic Forum Executive Chairman Prof Klaus Schwab to attend the event in Davos, adding that Nawaz held a meeting with Schwab where Pakistan’s economic growth and investment potential were acknowledged. It was also reminded that the prime minister held several meetings at the forum with world leaders and top executives from leading international companies – including the CEOs of VimpelCom and Procter & Gamble, Mr Jack Ma, Swiss Confederation president and the prime ministers of Sweden, Norway and Sri Lanka – for publicising Pakistan’s investment-friendly environment and the tremendous opportunities that the country offered. The statement said the prime minister also met Bill Gates on polio eradication from Pakistan and a group of top executives from leading Telecom companies. He held meeting with the UN secretary-general and effectively used the World Economic Forum to high light the Kashmir cause.  The spokesperson stated that Nawaz held highly-productive meetings at Davos and the news about barring him from the event was incorrect and based on fictitious information.     0 0 News item about PM engagements fictitious was posted in National of TheNews International - https://www.thenews.com.pk on January 26, 2017 and was last updated on January 26, 2017.

As of this point in earning season, 15 Dow members have reported earnings. Of the 15, Cramer found at least 13 with numbers that indicate the rally is the real deal. "This move is not alchemy, it is not animal spirits. It is the earnings, which is the best reason to rally," the "Mad Money" host said. Getty Images McDonald's worker prepares french fries to go. No. 1 was American Express, which went down after reporting earnings. Cramer thinks this is a big mistake, and expects it to head back to the $90s. No. 2 was Boeing, whose results impressed Cramer, especially with its profitable Dreamliner. No. 3, DuPont, reported a very strong quarter, leaving Cramer simply amazed. He attributed the success to CEO Ed Breen, who is in the process of merging with Dow Chemical. No. 4, General Electric, missed out big time, Cramer said. He was disappointed with the execution and confused by moves made with oil and gas, along with its shortfall in the turbine business. "Don't look for GE for help now that we have broken out above Dow 20,000," Cramer said. Goldman Sachs checked in at number 5, and is in a great position to benefit from deregulation and rate hikes. The last quarter was reported before these elements were even implemented, so Cramer could only salivate over what it could deliver once the backdrop improves. IBM was sixth, and traded down initially on its conference call—making Cramer convinced sellers were insane. Forty percent of IBM's business is growing like a young startup. He thinks it's time to pay more, not less for the stock, and said it could go to $200. No. 7, Johnson and Johnson, did not have a weak quarter, despite what naysayers believe, Cramer said. In a world that is less reliant on Donald Trump and less cyclical, he said it is a buy. JPMorgan, which just delivered the best quarter it has ever reported, was number 8. On virtually every metric, the company simply has no peer, Cramer said. Yet the stock is still cheap at only 13 times earnings. No. 9 was McDonald's, making Cramer feel lonely for liking the stock on the conference call. He said the stock is just fine, and doesn't agree that the company is done reinventing itself. No. 10, 3M, is so innovative, Cramer wouldn't be surprised to see if it led the way higher from here as consumers snap back. Procter & Gamble, at number 11, was ready when the dollar strengthened and had a large boost from earnings, large gains in market share and restructuring that is paying off. If the stock comes down, Cramer said it will be bought. No. 12, Travelers, just delivered a clean beat when it earned $3.20 a share when Wall Street was only looking for $2.81. "Look for this insurance company's investment portfolio to give you some real vig this year as rates go higher on risk-free securities. Travelers hates risk," Cramer said. At number 13, UnitedHealth has a pattern of blowing away numbers, followed by the stock falling into a funk as investors assess the quarter. Cramer believes that this stock is on the right side of President Donald Trump, because of its criticism of Obamacare. No. 14 was United Technologies, which delivered again. The numbers were so superb, investors didn't notice the couple of pennies per share Trump knocked off the company's earnings by keeping jobs in Indiana. Verizon, which logged in at number 15, was terrible, Cramer said. It was losing share all over the place, and was by far the worst in show. "If the numbers from the other 15 Dow stocks are even close to this good, we could have a lot more room to run," Cramer said. Questions for Cramer?

MENU All Girls Fantasy Sports Advice Real sports As seen on tv Rankings Everything else Shop Home Animals Current Page Snickers Will Air The First-Ever Live Super Bowl Ad, Starring Kylo Ren Tweet Rick Chandler 2:55 pm, January 25th, 2017 And here we go — it’s time for the Super Bowl commercials to start rolling in. These days you don’t have to wait for the big game, because where’s the profit in that? For $5 million per 30-second spot, companies need to get all the publicity they can from these commercials, so releasing them pre-game is the way to go. As the new spots come out, we’ll be keeping you up to date right here, and when we get enough we’ll rank ’em. Check back every day until Feb. 5. UPDATES: * GoDaddy has a teaser trailer: cats on Roombas! * Mr. Clean is in every room of the house and he is watching you. * Snickers will air the first-ever live Super Bowl commercial. * Heinz is sitting out Super Bowl LI, but its presence will be felt. The Full Ads Skittles checks in with their new ad, and it’s an upgrade from last year’s bizarre Steven Tyler nightmare-inducer. “Katy! …” TurboTax is back for the fourth consecutive year with a 45-second spot, starring Humpty Dumpty. Wix would like to remind you that it’s easy to make your own stunning web site. Although what that has to do with busting up a restaurant is unclear. Intel apparently thinks that people will watch Tom Brady do anything — even brush his teeth before eating a pancake off of the floor. After taking it away from a dog. I would have re-thought this one. Teaser Trailers We don’t know exactly how this is going to work, but Snickers‘ 30-second spot will be live to lead off the third quarter of the game. It will feature Adam Driver (Kylo Ren in Star Wars: The Force Awakens, and be preceded by a 36-hour livestream, at SnickersLive.com (noon ET on Thursday, Feb. 2, until midnight Friday night. Here are four teasers, combined for your convenience. None of it makes any sense so far. GoDaddy is under new management (a new ad agency), and is back after skipping Super Bowl 50. According to AdAge, the ad will go like this: “In GoDaddy’s commercial, we will be introduced to the ‘Internet,’ who is covered in tattoos of web references, like Wi-Fi symbols, memes and floppy discs. The 30-second game day spot will include a look inside the house of the ‘Internet’ and will feature a song made popular by the internet. While most of the references included in the commercial will be recognizable to a broad audience, there will be some more obscure references hidden throughout.” Proctor & Gamble makes its Super Bowl debut, boasting that Mr. Clean is “the official cleaner of Super Bowl LI”. But this is a very different Mr. Clean … apparently he wants to sex you up, in every room of the house. Avocados From Mexico is back, and the ad — to be shown during the first commercial break of the game — will focus on the avocado being a health food. Since more avocados are consumed during the Super Bowl than during any other time of the year, it’s surprising that AFM have only been in the past three big games. Here’s the teaser trailer, featuring Jon Lovitz: Kia is going to make you wait awhile to see what’s chasing Melissa McCarthy. PepsiCo will be touting its line of bottle water products, Lifewtr, with its Inspiration Drops spot. Featured will be a songby John Legend. Not participating this year Butterfinger, Doritos, Mini USA, SunTrust, Taco Bell, Toyota, Visa. Heinz, which gave us the entertaining Weiner Stampede during last year’s game, is also not returning to the Super Bowl. But they saved a few mil by running an ad right after the game, and releasing an extended version online (which may be the wave of the future).

To support Ad Age and the industry we cover please either: SUBSCRIBE or WHITELIST US Lowdown: First Reviews Are in on Bud Light's New Campaign Published on January 25, 2017. The Lowdown is Ad Age's weekly look at news nuggets from across the world of marketing, including trends, campaign tidbits, executive comings and goings and more. When the nation's largest beer brand changes its ad campaign, it's a big deal -- especially when the brand is in need of a comeback. So it's not surprising that the first spot from Bud Light's new "Famous Among Friends" campaign is already generating a range of reactions. Beer Business Daily Editor Harry Schuhmacher -- who is not afraid to call it as he sees it -- gushed on Monday to his readers that "it's the best work out of Bud Light since Bob Lachky handed over the reins of the Clydesdales," referring to the highly respected former chief creative officer who left the brewer in 2009. On Tuesday he followed up with anonymous feedback from a reader (the publication caters to beer wholesalers) who praised the ad for "calling itself out for being a sappy … bromance which is exactly the narrative we could all use these divisive days." One beer distributor told Ad Age that the campaign "is much better than the last two campaigns, which were terrible," referring to last year's politically themed "Bud Light Party" effort and 2014/2015's "The Perfect Beer for Whatever Happens" effort. But the distributor added: "I believe it has potential but am concerned it is generic. I'm not sure a brand can own friendship any more than it can own refreshment. I'm looking forward to seeing the spot they will show on the Super Bowl. I'm hopeful it will be indicative of a campaign that can build brand image and sell boxes." MillerCoors, meanwhile, seized on the similarities it says the new Bud Light ad shares with their old "Miller Time" campaign for Miller Lite, which debuted in 2012 with the resurrected classic tagline. Ads tried to portray Lite as the beer good friends drink when they get together. This old Lite ad below shares some of the same traits as the new Bud Light spot. (MillerCoors has since moved on to a new campaign that plays up Lite's liquid and heritage credentials.) In a statement to Ad Age, MillerCoors Chief Marketing Officer David Kroll said: "In 2012, we unsuccessfully aired similar work for Miller Lite called 'Brewed for Brotherhood' that failed on many levels. Our campaign said nothing about the beer, it dramatized cliché beer 'bro' bonding and drinkers found the spots confusing as the execution was dependent on audio for storytelling. It's work we've moved away from for good reason: We are excited to build purpose-led brands and let drinkers know more about the quality of our beer. While it's tough to predict the success of a campaign on one execution, we have been down this road before and would be surprised if the results were different." Anheuser-Busch InBev declined to respond. Mr. Kroll's comments reflect a newly aggressive approach MillerCoors is taking against its rival, including criticizing Bud Light in advertising. Now, onto some less confrontational tidbits -- like free stuff from the world's largest fast food marketer… McDonald's gives away Big Mac Special Sauce for the first time in the U.S. Credit: McDonald's McDonald's is giving away 10,000 bottles of its Big Mac special sauce this week. The giveaway happens at restaurants on Jan. 26. Some media outlets, including Ad Age, got their chilled bottles early. The giveaway ties into this month's nationwide introduction of the smaller Mac Jr. and larger Grand Mac burgers, set to be in restaurants through March 20, while supplies last. McDonald's has given out Big Mac special sauce in other countries before, but said this is the first bottle giveaway at home. And while 10,000 might sound like a lot, there aren't even enough for each of its 14,000 or so U.S. restaurants. Meanwhile, other restaurants are upping their marketing games with, well, games. Chipotle Credit: Chipotle Mexican Grill Chipotle Mexican Grill this week introduced an online game called "Cado Crusher" in partnership with Super Bowl advertiser Avocados From Mexico. In the online game, players smash and blend ingredients to make guacamole. The payoff? A mobile offer for a free order of chips and guacamole at Chipotle, with the purchase of an entree. "This game provides a fun way for our customers to see the short list of quality ingredients that go into each and every batch of our scratch-made guacamole," Mark Crumpacker, chief marketing and development officer at Chipotle, said in a statement. Chipotle said to make its guacamole, each of its restaurants goes through about five cases of avocados a day. Yahoo and Pizza Hut's Squares Pick'em Credit: Yahoo For Avocados From Mexico, the game is a chance to generate a little more buzz before its third consecutive appearance with a Super Bowl spot. This week's other restaurant game partnership announcement comes from Pizza Hut and Yahoo Fantasy Sports. They have teamed up for Squares Pick'em, a tech-savvy version of the squares betting boxes people often fill out for the Super Bowl. Just like real life, the numbers won't be displayed until squares are chosen. The game works similarly to Yahoo's other fantasy sports programs. Users invite friends to pick boxes on a 10x10 grid and set up their own leagues. Super Bowl Sunday is Pizza Hut's busiest day of the year. "The entire sports-viewing occasion has changed, with digital engagement being as much a part of it as the game itself, which is why we're excited to be part of the launch for this new digital game from Yahoo Sports," David Daniels, VP-advertising & media at Pizza Hut, said in a statement. Pizza Hut will be featured in display, search and email ads, while Yahoo will promote the program through blogs and NFL stories, Yahoo said. Procter & Gamble Co. already has some cleaning brands advertising in the game -- Mr. Clean and Febreze -- but it's also spending a bit more to improve your bathroom experience during the Super Bowl. While people put plenty of thought and money into buying booze and snacks for the game, P&G believes they aren't spending enough time thinking about the bathroom. That's a shame, because P&G says that more U.S. toilets are flushed during halftime of the Super Bowl than any other time of the year, yet 62% of people say they're likely to forget buying bathroom supplies for the comfort of their party guests. To remedy that, Citizen Relations has launched a publicity and social-media effort around the #HalftimeBathroomBreak for Febreze and Charmin, the latter of which isn't buying an ad, but is the official toilet paper of the NFL and hitching a promotional ride with its sibling. To back the effort, Citizen has sent out what may be the first press kit ever to include a golden (painted) toilet seat, along with a roll of Charmin, Febreze products, and a Charmin-Febreze bobble head, among other things. It's still not butter. But Unilever's I Can't Believe It's Not Butter has stopped dwelling so much on that, at least in the U.K. The brand has changed its name there to "I Can't Believe It's So Good … for Everything." This name change is not coming to the U.S., where the brand has its roots and a bigger business, a Unilever spokeswoman said. As for the reason it's doing this in the U.K., a Unilever brand manager told the Sun newspaper that it's about highlighting the spread's versatility for cooking. It's apparently not about shifting focus from not being butter, given that butter has been eroding sales of margarine for years. Switch Fresh deodorant from Dwyane Wade's cousin Antoine Wade has refillable packaging. Credit: Switch Fresh NBA star Dwyane Wade has been a pitchman for Unilever's Dove Men+Care, but now his cousin Antoine Wade is leaning on his support to launch a rival deodorant product with a unique twist -- refillable containers. Switch Fresh, which uses replaceable deodorant cartridges, is an "eco-friendly" design that's an alternative to what the brand says are the 800 deodorant packages an average person will throw away in a lifetime. The product was born from a brainstorming session with Dwyane, said Antoine, in a statement. For now, Unilever and other titans of deodorant probably have nothing to fear, as Switch Fresh is just starting out with an Indiegogo fundraising effort -- albeit backed by some cool product shots. Shiseido Americas, the Japanese cosmetics company's U.S. subsidiary, has acquired Matchco, which produces mass-customized makeup. The patented technology lets consumers scan their skin tones through a mobile app, then uses the data collected to individually blend a matching, custom foundation for each person. The app was a winner of Apple's "Best New App" and "Best of November" awards at launch in 2015. The idea is to use the technology across the company's cosmetics portfolio. The Matchco team will remain in California, where it will also pitch in with product development and consumer insights for Shiseido. European Wax Center Credit: European Wax Center European Wax Center is baring all with a new campaign, its first from Pereira & O'Dell New York, which won the Aventura, Fla.-based salon's business last year. The "Revealing You" campaign includes TV, radio, print and out-of-home, with photography from Miles Aldridge. The 13-year-old chain, which has over 628 locations, spent $5.4 million on measured media in 2015, according to Kantar Media. Contributing: E.J.

Facilitated programming and anchor-led pavilions will showcase companies and entrepreneurs delivering innovative brands and business solutions fashioned around Good Food, Good Homes, Good Mobility, Good Packaging, Good Technology, Good Energy and more.

Here are four things you should know Africa is rapidly becoming one of the most desirable investment destinations. Picture: pixabay.com World Economic Forum Africa World Economic Forum 2017 Africa business Email Print Tweet Share World Economic Forum | 3 days ago DAVOS - Africa is home to seven of the 10 fastest-growing economies in the world, and despite the pre-conceived ideas of a continent forever plagued by disease, war and turmoil, it is rapidly becoming one of the most desirable investment destinations. Of course, the past two years have not been easy for the continent. In 2015, an economic slump saw GDP growth slow to 3.0%, down from 4.5% in 2014. In 2016, low commodity prices continued to impede growth, and expansion decelerated to lows not seen since the 2009 global financial crisis. But I believe 2017 will be the year the continent bounces back. Here’s why. 2017: AFRICA’S YEAR? While the headlines might be all about falling commodity prices, here on the ground I’m seeing something different: an environment where private sector-led investments is starting to flourish, in large part thanks to government-led far-reaching economic and political reforms Indeed, the business landscape has been rapidly changing, due to increased regional mobility, rapid urbanization and population growth, all of which has boosted demand for African-manufactured products and services. This, coupled with strong interconnectedness and a sense of pan-Africanism, has brought much optimism for businesses operating in the region. With the public sector facilitating the establishment of Africa’s biggest economic bloc – that may culminate in a Free Trade Area spanning Cape to Cairo – the next great investment destination for 2017 may very well be Africa. Take the example of agri-business, which has and always will be at the centre of growth in the continent. Recently, the continent has seen a surge of innovations that are accelerating agricultural productivity. For example, new platforms are providing farmers with information on commodity prices, the availability of buyers and sellers, and guidance on best practices in harvesting and disease management. FOUR SIGNS THAT THINGS ARE LOOKING UP IN AFRICA The rise of these innovations speaks to the progress and potential of Africa’s economy more broadly, its people and their ability to identify localized solutions for growth. But this isn’t the only clue as to Africa’s potential. In fact, I see four key trends driving large-scale private sector growth on the continent. These trends are not only shaping the strategies for existing companies but have also influenced the nature and appetite for joint venture projects across the continent. 1. Processing and value addition For a long time, development practitioners have emphasized need to give more attention to the processing of raw agricultural produce rather than exporting unprocessed agricultural commodities. Indeed, African governments have been promoting value addition for economic development for years, and yet there are still plenty of investment opportunities. Over 80% of value in the global food industry is in value-added components such as sorting, cleaning and packaging fruits and vegetables. The various forms of value-addition provide opportunities for the private sector to expand their commercial activities and access higher-value markets, either for domestic consumers or exports. Not only do they provide employment at all levels, but they have proven time and time again to drastically change the economic landscape of countries. A brilliant example of this is Kenya – the export value of fresh vegetables grew by as much as 250% after it stopped simply exporting raw material and started incorporating value-added tasks such as cleaning, packaging and freezing products. Similar to the fruit and vegetables sub-sectors, Africa’s cotton and apparel value chain have joined forces to integrate the global textile supply chain. In South Africa, the Aid by Trade Foundation entered into a partnership with the African Cotton and Textiles Industries Federation to promote the sustainable cotton and textile industry in Sub-Saharan Africa. The objective of this partnership was to increase productivity, competitiveness and sustainability of cotton production, and thus strengthen textile production in Africa. In Tanzania, the MeTL Group started out with cotton ginning operations for export. We then opened four textile factories for spinning and weaving of cotton in Tanzania and Mozambique. Today, we have launched our first ever garmenting factory which manufactures school uniforms, T-shirts and several cotton-apparel by-products. 2. Fast-moving consumer goods for Africa by Africa Africa is home to one of the world’s fastest growing populations and an exploding middle class with more disposable income than ever before. As a result, there is high demand for fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG), such as apparel, hygiene products, food and electronics. Currently, almost all these products are still being imported. FMCG retailers tend to operate in low-margin environments, and as a result, large markets are crucial to their growth and success. With a rapidly growing continent and changing livelihoods, the potential for private sector actors in the FMCG space is promising for 2017 and beyond. McKinsey projects the growth of these consumer-facing industries will surpass $400 billion by 2020. Over the past few years, several African entrepreneurs have started local production using locally available material in manufacturing soaps, edible oils, household cleaning products, and even school uniforms. From local companies like Del Monte Kenya Limited, Tongaat Hulett, to foreign conglomerates like Unilever and Procter and Gamble, Africa’s FMCG sector has provided plenty of business opportunities, and there are some who say this could be the next “gold rush”. US retail giant Wal-Mart’s recent $2.5 billion dollar investment into South African retailer Massmart points that way. McKinsey have described this sector as the “single-largest business opportunity in Africa”. If these figures from the A.T. Kearney 2015 African Retail Development Index (ARDI) are anything to go by, that prediction is accurate. 3. ‘Bottom of the pyramid’ consumers Despite rapid socio-political advancements in Africa, only around half of people there earn more than $4 a day. While in Africa this might be categorized as “middle class”, manufactures locally and globally would still label them as low-income consumers, or the bottom of the pyramid (BOP) market. The competitive advantage of African owned and run businesses is that, unlike their foreign counterparts, they understand the purchasing decisions of the world's more than 5 billion low-income consumers, which gives them a competitive edge. Despite rapid socio-political advancements in Africa, only around half of people there earn more than $4 a day. While in Africa this might be categorized as “middle class”, manufactures locally and globally would still label them as low-income consumers, or the bottom of the pyramid (BOP) market. The competitive advantage of African owned and run businesses is that, unlike their foreign counterparts, they understand the purchasing decisions of the world's more than 5 billion low-income consumers, which gives them a competitive edge. When CK Prahalad's published The Fortune at the Bottom of the Pyramid, he was speaking directly to the many African entrepreneurs that understood the world’s poor and their untapped buying power. Companies on the continent are learning how to serve these consumers while making money in the process. Single-use and/or low-cost products have been experiencing solid demand. Products like SC Johnson's individual mosquito coils for $0.01 and returnable 200ml bottles of Coca-Cola continue to be profitable because these companies have invested heavily in the logistics needed to reach BOP consumers, and have carried out market research on the packaging and disposable income required for poorer consumers to be able to buy their products. 4. African export market Export-led growth has been a successful strategy for several developing economies. Through incentive programmes and policies, African governments and multilateral donors have encouraged exports, which have allowed companies to further diversity their operations and reap the financial benefits. For a long time, the continent was not able to meet global export requirements. However, with the multiplicity of opportunities today – increased market linkages, partnership support, consultation, information sharing and tailored training for export trading – we’ve been able to take advantage of the global demand for African exports. With a growing world population and an imminent danger of global food shortages, Africa is well poised to become the breadbasket of the world. Africa’s exports will be critical to our development as a global society. The graph below illustrates the importance of commodities to different economies (dark blue and orange areas). These exports that continue to dominate many national economies will become extremely important in the growth of Africa’s private sector in 2017 and beyond. These four trends have been a long time in the making, but after a slow 2016, it looks like 2017 could be a good year for all those doing business in what is now one of the most exciting and dynamic regions in the world.

Materials companies led U.S. stocks modestly higher Friday, recouping much of the market's loss from a day earlier and snapping a five-day losing streak for the Dow Jones industrial average. Another crop of encouraging company earnings news helped lift the market, but investors were mostly focused on events in Washington as Donald Trump was sworn in as the 45th president of the United States. The major stock indexes pulled back slightly as Trump delivered remarks after taking the oath of office. Among topics of particular interest to Wall Street, the speech touched on trade and the Trump administration's intention of protecting the United States from “the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies and destroying our jobs.” “The market is still embracing the Trump agenda, based on the market's reaction to the speech,” said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial. “Now the question the market has is, specifically, what does all of that mean in terms of trade?” The Dow rose 94.85 points, or 0.5 percent, to 19,827.25. The Standard & Poor's 500 index gained 7.62 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,271.31. The Nasdaq composite index added 15.25 points, or 0.3 percent, to 5,555.33. Despite Friday's gains, the three major stock indexes ended the week lower. Stocks have slowed in 2017 after surging for several weeks following Election Day on investor optimism that a Trump administration and Republican Congress would usher in business-friendly policies. But the possibility of increased tariffs or trade restrictions has also loomed as a potential drag in profits for big U.S. companies. “Historically, the market has performed best in the November-April time frame,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. “The Trump victory added a tailwind to this traditional seasonal factor.” Typically, stocks don't do well on inauguration day. Going back to 1928, the S&P has averaged a drop of 1.05 percent on inauguration days, according Bespoke Investment Group. Beyond the presidential transition in Washington, investors pored over the latest batch of corporate earnings Friday, bidding up shares in companies that reported results that beat Wall Street's expectations. Skyworks Solutions jumped 13 percent, the biggest gainer in the S&P 500. The stock climbed $10.21 to $88.67. Citizens Financial Group gained $1.09, or 3.1 percent, to $35.82. Traders also drove up shares in Procter & Gamble after the consumer goods maker released a strong growth forecast. The stock added $2.75, or 3.2 percent, to $87.45. Strong subscriber numbers helped lift AT&T, giving a boost to phone company stocks overall. AT&T added 45 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $41.45. Some companies' earnings failed to impress the market. General Electric slid 2.2 percent after the conglomerate reported fourth-quarter revenue that fell short of analysts' forecasts. The stock gave up 68 cents to $30.53. Investors sold off Bristol-Myers Squibb after the drugmaker said it won't pursue accelerated regulatory approval for a two-drug lung cancer treatment. The stock was the biggest decliner in the S&P 500 index, shedding $6.26, or 11.3 percent, to $49.23. Major stock indexes overseas were mixed Friday. Germany's DAX rose 0.3 percent, while Britain's FTSE 100 fell 0.1 percent. France's CAC 40 added 0.2 percent. In Asia, Hong Kong's Hang Seng shed 0.7 percent after the Chinese government said the economy grew at a 6.8 percent annual rate in the last quarter, even as full-year growth increased 6.7 percent, the weakest in three decades. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index rose 0.3 percent. Bond prices were little changed. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note held steady at 2.47 percent. Yields have been rising as investors expect inflation to increase. In currency trading, the dollar fell to 114.31 yen from Thursday's 114.80 yen. The euro rose to $1.0707 from $1.0659. The British pound edged up to $1.2378 from $1.2337.

WSJ's Sue Shellenbarger and Tanya Rivero discuss how employees can use humor to their benefit. Photo: iStock By Sue Shellenbarger Sue Shellenbarger The Wall Street Journal BiographySue Shellenbarger Google+ Sue.Shellenbarger@wsj.com Jan. 24, 2017 10:51 a.m. ET 16 COMMENTS Colleagues who make others laugh are seen as more self-confident, competent and higher in status, according to a series of experiments by researchers at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School and Harvard Business School. This conclusion, compelling for the many people who have spent on clothes, cars, credentials or coaching to burnish their image, has gotten some understandable attention recently. Laughs are a risky path to prestige, however: Tell just one inappropriate joke and your status among peers hits the skids. Humor is often seen as a sign of intelligence, and delivering a joke well requires sensitivity to others’ moods and tastes. John Thorne often uses self-deprecating humor to elevate his employees’ status among clients. As president of Automotive Events, a Cleveland-based producer of car-related promotions, he’s often the one who wins new clients. But when he introduces them to the employees who will be organizing and running their events, he jokes, “I don’t actually do anything. It’s these guys who do the work,” he says. When clients laugh, he says, “No seriously, I don’t do anything all day. I’m just here to make sure the coffee is pouring.” The gambit helps clients feel better about the transition to working with someone else, he says. Telling jokes can make leaders be seen as more confident and competent, but it also can bring executives down to employees’ level, making them seem more human and vulnerable, says Clayton Fletcher, a comedy consultant with Peppercomm, a strategic communications firm in New York City, who has coached Mr. Thorne. Past research has shown the value of workplace humor in easing stress, building rapport and increasing the productivity and creativity of teams. Sources: T. B. Bitterly and M. Schweitzer, The Wharton School The Wharton study is the first to assess the impact of joking on an individual’s status at work. Researchers asked a total of 2,300 participants in eight experiments to observe mock ad testimonials, view illustrated job interview transcripts and recall jokes told by co-workers. Participants rated each joke-teller’s status based on such criteria as how respected, powerful, admired and influential the person was likely to be in colleagues’ eyes. Simply recalling a funny joke by a co-worker elevated the joke-teller’s status in participants’ minds, says T. Bradford Bitterly, a doctoral candidate at Wharton and lead author on the study, published in November in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology. “It shows how powerful humor can potentially be,” he says. Twenty-two-year-old Daniel Monarres of San Antonio believes his ability to poke fun at himself during an interview helped him win a slot in a highly competitive graduate program at Texas A&M University’s Mays Business School in College Station, Texas. When the interviewer asked about his hobbies and whether he played golf, Mr. Monarres admitted that he didn’t, then quipped that he served as trainer to his two college roommates, both expert golfers who played on the university team. The interviewer laughed and the conversation ended on a warm note, he says. Related Coverage Why Telling a Joke Pays Off for the Boss How to Build Instant Rapport in an Interview Secrets of Effective Office Humor Effective humor can trigger abrupt changes in people’s image. A soft-spoken introvert who “out of nowhere, in a deadpan manner, delivers a line that is super-funny,” can rocket to greater influence among co-workers, says Bob Kulhan, founder of Business Improv, a Chicago consulting firm, and author of “Getting to ‘Yes, And,’ ” a new book about using comedic skills at work. There’s plenty of joking going on in the workplace, and a lot of it is missing the target. While all but 1 of 200 participants surveyed by the Wharton researchers could recall a joke told by a co-worker, they rated nearly one-third of the jokes as inappropriate. There’s no risk to your reputation in telling an appropriate joke, even if it flops and no one laughs, the Wharton study shows. You’ll still be seen as confident. Sources: T. B. Bitterly and M. Schweitzer, The Wharton School Telling an inappropriate joke, however, can do serious damage. Participants in another Wharton study assessed the status of three job seekers who were asked in a simulated interview to suggest a creative use for an old tire. One drew a laugh by saying, “Someone doing CrossFit could use it for 30 minutes, then tell you about it forever.” The second made an inappropriate joke about turning the tire into condoms, and the third gave a serious response: “Make a tire swing out of it.” Participants rated the first joker highest in status, the serious respondent second and the applicant who made the off-color joke last. Figuring out whether a joke will fly requires deciding whether it meshes with the setting, listeners’ tastes and their purpose at the moment, says Andrew Tarvin, a New York City workplace humor coach and author who has taught comedy techniques to employees at Procter & Gamble, PricewaterhouseCoopers, GlaxoSmithKline and other companies. A joke can work even in a somber situation if it relieves tension. A wisecrack can flop badly, however, if the joker disregards listeners’ emotions: A CEO who jokes after a round of layoffs that he’s going to have to get a smaller yacht is likely to come across as aggressive and mean, says Mr. Tarvin. And spouting one-liners in a meeting where participants are intent on solving a complex problem isn’t likely to accomplish much more than annoying people. Work & Family Mailbox Q: Your column on what parents of teenage boys need to know was very helpful. What is the impact of kids’ heavy use of social media during such a fragile developmental period?—T.M. A: There’s some evidence linking social-media use to declines in children’s social skills and empathy. Preteens who spent five days at an overnight nature camp with no access to television, computers or mobile phones showed significant gains in their ability to read unspoken emotional cues in others’ faces, based on test scores before and after the camp session, according to a 2014 study led by researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles. The campers’ scores rose more than scores of a control group of preteens who remained at school with their usual screen time. College students’ scores on a broader measure of empathy have fallen since 2000, according to a 30-year research review students’ responses to a standardized empathy scale. The results are based on students’ agreement with such statements as, “I often have tender, concerned feelings for people less fortunate than me,” and, “I sometimes try to understand my friends better by imagining how things look from their perspective.” Write to Sue Shellenbarger at sue.shellenbarger@wsj.com Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Most Popular Videos Trump Emphasizes Close Relationship With U.K. A Real-Life Alexa Lives With 'Alexa' Ferris Bueller 'Oh Yeah' Song Helps Co-Creator Earn Millions Goldman: 2 Stock Picks; How to Play Bonds Oscar Schafer's 3 Values in a Pricey Market Most Popular Articles Opinion: Trump Tries to Build a ‘Different Party’ Opinion: Trump’s Little Mexican War Miami-Dade Mayor Orders Jails to Comply With Trump Immigration Plan Opinion: Chuck Schumer Goes Wild Opinion: A GOP Regulatory Game Changer SHOW COMMENTS HIDE COMMENTS (16) Failed to load comments Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Trump Emphasizes Close Relationship With U.K. A Real-Life Alexa Lives With 'Alexa' Ferris Bueller 'Oh Yeah' Song Helps Co-Creator Earn Millions Goldman: 2 Stock Picks; How to Play Bonds Oscar Schafer's 3 Values in a Pricey Market Most Popular Articles Opinion: Trump Tries to Build a ‘Different Party’ Opinion: Trump’s Little Mexican War Miami-Dade Mayor Orders Jails to Comply With Trump Immigration Plan Opinion: Chuck Schumer Goes Wild Opinion: A GOP Regulatory Game Changer Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India América Latina Brasil 中国 (China) 日本 (Japan) Edition: U.S. Asia Europe India América Latina Brasil 中国 (China) 日本 (Japan) Text Size: Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP« WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

Figuring out whether a joke will fly requires deciding whether it meshes with the setting, listeners’ tastes and their purpose at the moment, says Andrew Tarvin, a New York City workplace humor coach and author who has taught comedy techniques to employees at Procter & Gamble, PricewaterhouseCoopers, GlaxoSmithKline and other companies. A joke can work even in a somber situation if it relieves tension. A wisecrack can flop badly, however, if the joker disregards listeners’ emotions: A CEO who jokes after a round of layoffs that he’s going to have to get a smaller yacht is likely to come across as aggressive and mean, says Mr. Tarvin. And spouting one-liners in a meeting where participants are intent on solving a complex problem isn’t likely to accomplish much more than annoying people. Work & Family Mailbox Q: Your column on what parents of teenage boys need to know was very helpful. What is the impact of kids’ heavy use of social media during such a fragile developmental period?—T.M. A: There’s some evidence linking social-media use to declines in children’s social skills and empathy. Preteens who spent five days at an overnight nature camp with no access to television, computers or mobile phones showed significant gains in their ability to read unspoken emotional cues in others’ faces, based on test scores before and after the camp session, according to a 2014 study led by researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles. The campers’ scores rose more than scores of a control group of preteens who remained at school with their usual screen time. College students’ scores on a broader measure of empathy have fallen since 2000, according to a 30-year research review students’ responses to a standardized empathy scale. The results are based on students’ agreement with such statements as, “I often have tender, concerned feelings for people less fortunate than me,” and, “I sometimes try to understand my friends better by imagining how things look from their perspective.” Write to Sue Shellenbarger at sue.shellenbarger@wsj.com Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Most Popular Videos Trump Emphasizes Close Relationship With U.K. A Real-Life Alexa Lives With 'Alexa' Ferris Bueller 'Oh Yeah' Song Helps Co-Creator Earn Millions Goldman: 2 Stock Picks; How to Play Bonds Oscar Schafer's 3 Values in a Pricey Market Most Popular Articles Opinion: Trump Tries to Build a ‘Different Party’ Opinion: Trump’s Little Mexican War Miami-Dade Mayor Orders Jails to Comply With Trump Immigration Plan Opinion: Chuck Schumer Goes Wild Opinion: A GOP Regulatory Game Changer SHOW COMMENTS HIDE COMMENTS (16) Failed to load comments Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Trump Emphasizes Close Relationship With U.K. A Real-Life Alexa Lives With 'Alexa' Ferris Bueller 'Oh Yeah' Song Helps Co-Creator Earn Millions Goldman: 2 Stock Picks; How to Play Bonds Oscar Schafer's 3 Values in a Pricey Market Most Popular Articles Opinion: Trump Tries to Build a ‘Different Party’ Opinion: Trump’s Little Mexican War Miami-Dade Mayor Orders Jails to Comply With Trump Immigration Plan Opinion: Chuck Schumer Goes Wild Opinion: A GOP Regulatory Game Changer Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India América Latina Brasil 中国 (China) 日本 (Japan) Edition: U.S. Asia Europe India América Latina Brasil 中国 (China) 日本 (Japan) Text Size: Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP« WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

The US-founded company will see former BBC Worldwide executive Robert Leach take the helm as general manager. Peter Birch, managing director of 1st Screen, will be Kargo’s commercial director, while Rob Williams, also previously with BBC Worldwide, will be operations director. Leach: Leading Kargo’s APAC launch Kargo claims to be “invitation only” in which publishers and advertisers it works with, on what it says are only as premium content sites. The Australian office – which is a prelude to a launch into Asia Pacific – joins Kargo’s offices in London, Chicago, New York and Los Angeles. Kargo employs around 250 people globally. Leach will report to Kargo’s international GM Owen Hanks. Hanks said in a statement: “Many of the global publishers and top brands that Kargo works with in North America and the UK have encouraged us to continue our international expansion into the Asia Pacific region where there is a growing demand for quality mobile advertising. “I’m confident that Robert, Peter and Rob are the right team.” Among the brands working with Kargo are Unilever, P&G and L’Oreal, while publishers include Bauer, The New York Times and CBS Interactive. Leach moved to Australia in 2006 as head of Multichannel Network’s digital division MCN Connect after previously working for British satellite broadcaster BSkyB, where he led the company’s commercial team, focusing on its interactive red button services. Leach left MCN in 2011 and until late last year worked as director of strategy, business development and digital for BBC Worldwide. Birch: Previously 1st Screen MD Meanwhile, Birch joins the company from Mobile Embrace’s mobile marketing offering, 1st Screen, where he’s been since 2010. Before that, he was head of digital for Network Ten from 2007 to 2010, and before that was in the UK as head of interactive sales for the country’s largest commercial broadcaster, ITV. Williams: Led BBC’s direct-to-consumer digital offerings Williams joined BBC Worldwide in 2013 as a commercial analyst, before becoming head of consumer digital, retail and wholesale in 2015.

Paramedics sent to the 5000 block of Queen Victoria Road shortly after 5 p.m. Monday on a medical emergency call pronounced Fabio Sementilli, 49, dead at the scene. The paramedics found the Canadian-born hair stylist in a pool of blood in the outdoor patio area and contacted the Los Angeles Police Department’s Topanga Division.

The victim’s black 2008 Porsche 911 Carrera, which had paper plates, was missing. Police confirmed Thursday afternoon that the vehicle had been recovered, but no details about when and where it was found were made available. Sementilli was an established hairdresser who served as vice president of education for Wella, the salon professional division of Proctor and Gamble, according to Salon Today magazine. Anyone with information on the crime was urged to call homicide detectives at 818-374-1925, or 877-LAPD-247.
