Most Popular The Lowdown is Ad Age's weekly look at news nuggets from across the world of marketing, including trends, campaign tidbits, executive comings and goings and more. The 2016 Summer Games are over, but a new winner in Olympics advertising is being announced Wednesday. Toyota's "Stand Together" spot showing people connecting across the globe won as the top TV commercial in USA Today Sports' first Ad Meter bracket for the Olympics. More than 145,000 votes were cast in the Rio Ad Meter Bracket from Aug. 12 through Wednesday morning. In all, 32 TV spots competed to be named the top spot in the inaugural Olympics bracket-style tournament. The final round pitted Toyota against Hershey. Hershey's "Hello From Home" featuring gold medal gymnast Simone Biles (shot when she was still just a heavily-favored Olympic hopeful) came in second place. Toyota won the Olympics-focused contest with its spot from by Saatchi and Saatchi, L.A., even though the automaker won't take over as a global Olympics sponsor until next year. It had to comply with strict trademark restrictions on Olympic phrases and imagery, as Ad Age previously noted. Hershey, meanwhile, used Olympics imagery in the runner-up commercial and other marketing as it is an official Team USA sponsor. While USA Today has tracked the popularity of Super Bowl ads for 28 years, Rio marked the first time it had an Olympics Ad Meter. Adobe sponsored the Rio Ad Meter Bracket. Omnigon was the tech provider with its BracketPro product that let fans watch the commercials before voting. (And in case readers have already forgotten, the winner of this year's USA Today Super Bowl Ad Meter was Hyundai's "First Date" spot starring Kevin Hart.) With so many commercials, it's hard to declare just one winner. Procter & Gamble Co. won the Olympics – or at least its two-minute "Strong" ad from Wieden & Kennedy did – according to ratings from Ace Metrix, which runs video ads past its online panel of consumers. Specifically, the ad in the long-running "Thank You Mom" campaign, which had run online since April, won on the Ace Metrix "Breakthrough" measure, which combines scores for likeability and attention and measures ability to break through clutter, according to the firm. Dick's Sporting Goods 60-second "The Contender" from Anomaly took second (silver), while Samsung's 1:40 mashup of national anthems "The Anthem" from Leo Burnett took the bronze from the survey panelists. On an aggregate basis across all their brands and ads – the decathlon of sorts – Nike, Dick's and P&G scored best overall among Olympic video ads in Ace Metrix Breakthrough scoring. And speaking of sports, P&G's Old Spice has signed Denver Broncos linebacker Von Miller to join the line of football player/pitchmen that includes Isaiah Mustafa and Terry Crews as an Old Spice guy. Mr. Miller, who was Most Valuable Player in Denver's Super Bowl 50 victory in February, will be the face of the 2016 NFL campaign for Old Spice. Football season also means more ad work for retired gridiron stars, like Howie Long. The hall of famer and Fox football analyst provides the voice-over for a new ad for the American Freedom Foundation, a support and advocacy group for veterans. The video by WPP's Cavalry aims to educate employers about how the skills that military veterans have translate into the civilian working world. Meanwhile, Jon Gruden is promoting Hooters as a place for what might be unexpected fantasy football draft parties -- women's leagues. The chain is promoting itself as a place for women to host drafts. A commercial shows a woman who seems to be confiding to her girlfriends about which date to choose: Tom or Aaron. She's actually talking about draft choices, and a Hooters Girl and Mr. Gruden help with her pick. Morrison, Hooters' ad agency of record, worked with the Atlanta division of the 4A's training program for junior talent to come up with the idea. Along with research that shows more women are watching professional football, Hooters cites data from the Fantasy Sports Trade Association that shows one-third of fantasy football managers last year were women. In music news, fans bummed to miss Joe Jonas and rock band DNCE perform on Friday as part of the Citi Concert Series on NBC's "Today Show" can quit complaining and put on a VR headset. For the first time, Citi, which began sponsoring the concert series late last year, is offering its concert in virtual reality. The bank will be doling out 7,000 branded Google cardboard headsets to Citi cardmembers and NBC fan pass subscribers ahead of the event, and also providing 3,000 sets to in-person attendees at Rockefeller Plaza who may want to access post-show content. "We want to push the boundaries of the very meaning of access beyond attendance and as technology evolves, it's allowing us to do so," Jennifer Breithaupt, managing director, media, advertising and global entertainment, at Citi, said in a statement. Indeed, VR is one of marketing's hottest trends; Forrester Research predicts that 52 million units of headsets will be in use by 2020. General Mills is being taken over by bunnies. First, the maker of Trix cereal held a rabbit showdown, in which people submitted videos of their furry friends' stunts. Submissions ended on Aug. 19, but you can watch the videos here. The day voting ended, its Annie's brand rolled out a digital brand campaign, "Organic for Everybunny," to show how the organic food brand will be popping up in new parts of the grocery store as it expands in categories such as cereal, granola bars, soup and yogurt --- all areas where General Mills has a strong conventional presence. The digital spots feature live bunnies in the store. Annie's President John Foraker said the brand is "putting a stake in the ground and making organic more accessible for more people in the U.S." The campaign, said to be Annie's biggest campaign spending to-date, comes from The BellShop. To celebrate the launch of Prego Farmers' Market sauce varieties, the brand installed a giant mason-style jar greenhouse at Chelsea Plaza in New York on August 17, 2016. Credit: Nathan Perkel In other food news, Campbell Soup's Prego brand set up a unique spin on a mason jar to show off a new line of sauces sold in, you guessed it, mason jars. A one-day farm in a jar display in Chelsea Plaza in New York on Aug. 17 promoted Prego Farmers' Market, a sauce line made with tomatoes, herbs, and vegetables. The 450-square foot space was redone with a farm vibe, complete with hay and a tractor, and the chance to pick tomatoes. About 3,000 people were said to visit the spot during the one-day pop up. Agencies working with the brand include Zeno Group, Anomaly, MEC, RND Studios and Shaw & Co. Productions. Contributing: Jessica Wohl, Jack Neff, Adrianne Pasquarelli, E.J.

By Josh Kolm August 24, 2016 Toronto-based innovation and research agency The Idea Suite has bolstered the CPG and shopper marketing experience on its team, hiring former P&G marketer Alexandra Glover as director of innovation. Prior to joining the agency last month, Glover had been with P&G for over 10 years, most recently as brand category leader for its oral care products, a role she took in April 2015. She also spent four years in leadership roles on the teams leading shopper marketing programs at Costco, Target and Shoppers Drug Mart. She began with P&G in brand manager roles for its oral care and female shave categories. “We’re thrilled to welcome Alex to the team and benefit from her vast experience in commercial and retail innovation, both of which are becoming key areas of focus for our Canadian clients,” said Fiona Stevenson, co-president and founding partner at The Idea Suite, in a press release. Stevenson is also a P&G veteran. The Idea Suite, founded at the beginning of 2015 by Stevenson and co-president Shelli Baltman, focuses on using qualitative consumer and shopper research methods to develop and design innovation strategy and programs, including new products, services, brands and marketing concepts. Over the past 18 months, clients have included Mondelez, McDonald’s, Clover Leaf, Molson Coors, Catelli, Nestlé Foods and CIBC. Also on the innovation front, the agency hired Jenna Valera as innovation manager earlier this year. Glover and Valera have joined a small roster of permanent employees that is rounded out with freelance designers, brand consultants, researchers and social media experts.

Facebook Inc. has spent years developing its ability to zero in on consumers based on demographics, shopping habits and life milestones. P&G, the maker of myriad household goods including Tide and Pampers, initially jumped at the opportunity to market directly to subsets of shoppers, from teenage shavers to first-time homeowners. Marc Pritchard, P&G’s chief marketing officer, said the company has realized it took the strategy too far. “We targeted too much, and we went too narrow,” he said in an interview, “and now we’re looking at: What is the best way to get the most reach but also the right precision?” Mr. Pritchard said P&G won’t cut back on Facebook spending and will employ targeted ads where it makes sense, such as pitching diapers to expectant mothers. He said P&G has ramped up spending both on digital sites and traditional platforms. One category the company is scaling back: smaller websites that lack the reach of sites such as Facebook, Google and YouTube. On a broader scale, P&G’s shift highlights the limits of such targeting for big brands, one of the cornerstones of Facebook’s ad business. The social network is able to command higher prices for its targeted marketing; the narrower the targeting the more expensive the ad. Related Coverage Retailers Dominate List of Popular Holiday Ads Nov. 23, 2016 Forbes Takes a Page From Snapchat Nov. 22, 2016 BuzzFeed, NBCUniversal to Intertwine Ad Sales and Production Nov. 22, 2016 Mobile Ad Targeting Is Improving, According to Nielsen Nov. 22, 2016 P&G could be the bellwether on how consumer goods companies and big brands use digital advertising. Over the past year some marketers, specifically consumer product companies, have discovered they need to go “much more broad” with their advertising on social media sites such as Facebook, said James Douglas, executive director of social-media agency Society, which is owned by Interpublic Group. Mr. Douglas said case studies show that companies can receive a bigger sales increase if they reach a more significant portion of a platform’s overall audience. For instance, P&G two years ago tried targeting ads for its Febreze air freshener at pet owners and households with large families. The brand found that sales stagnated during the effort, but they rose when the campaign on Facebook and elsewhere was expanded last March to include anyone over 18. A Facebook spokeswoman said its partnership with P&G “grows every year” and the two companies learn from one another. “That has always been the spirit of how we work together and challenge one another,” she said. Facebook started working on a targeted ad system in 2007, when it was an unprofitable three-year-old startup with less than 60 million active users. At the time, its main marketing platform was free Facebook pages through which companies promoted their products. ENLARGE Facebook has since emerged as a marketing platform of singular scale. Last year, Facebook raked in $17.08 billion in ad revenue, up 49% year over year, as advertisers sought the attention of its 1.7 billion monthly active users. Advertisers can pinpoint their target audience precisely. Political candidates can focus on users in congressional districts, restaurant chains can run campaigns to spicy food lovers, and moving companies can find users who are “very likely” to move to another home. “If you could run an ad and reach a million people or run a targeted ad to reach 5,000, you have to have pretty impressive returns on that 5,000 to make it worth it,” said Peter Daboll, chief executive of Ace Metrix, which tests ads for effectiveness and works with Facebook. Cincinnati-based P&G spent roughly $7.2 billion on advertising globally in the year that ended in June, up about 1% from the previous year, according to company filings. P&G said it plans to increase it around 5% for the year that started July 1. Prior to last year’s increase, the company cut spending two years in a row. P&G’s push to find broader reach with its advertising is also evident in the company’s recent increases in television spending. Toward the end of last year P&G began shifting money back into television, according to people familiar with the matter. During the first quarter of 2016, the company’s ad spending jumped 11% to $429 million from the year earlier, Kantar Media said. For many of the largest advertisers in the world, the precise targeting tools touted by Facebook are less of a draw, said Pivotal Research analyst Brian Weiser. “The bigger your brand, the more you need broad reach and less targeted media,” he said. Targeting is paramount for advertisers trying to get users to download a game app or a small business trying to appeal to local customers. Facebook has started offering new tools specifically for large advertisers, including a way to boost brand awareness by showing ads to people who are more likely to pay attention to them. On Tuesday, it introduced changes that make it harder for people to block ads from appearing on its desktop website. “The cornerstone of our ad strategy is a mix of mass reach and personalized targeting that lends well to mobile consumption and is a strong complement to TV,” the Facebook spokeswoman said. Not all big advertisers are pulling back on Facebook’s targeted marketing. Priceline Group Inc. said it expects lower returns in the current quarter from bookings generated from its advertising, much of which goes through Alphabet Inc.’s Google. As a result the travel company plans to increase spending on Facebook’s targeted ads. “We found that a number of things we’ve done on Facebook works well,” Chief Executive Jeffery Boyd said. “We would like to spend more money on Facebook going forward.” Corrections & Amplifications: The correct name of the CEO of Priceline Group Inc. is Jeffery Boyd. An earlier version of this article misstated his name. (Aug. 17) — Suzanne Vranica contributed to this article.

The brand found that sales stagnated during the effort, but they rose when the campaign on Facebook and elsewhere was expanded last March to include anyone over 18.” Brand marketers–especially consumer-packaged-goods companies–that need to reach a wide audience through multiple channels, including TV, should use a broad-reach strategy. As the article underscored, Procter & Gamble does not intend to spend less on Facebook, only differently with broader targeting. Advertisers experiment with new precise ad targeting In the past few years, SocialCode has seen many CPG brands experiment with more precise targeting approaches. For example, the team at Pampers could hypothetically use third-party purchasing data to deliver ads on Facebook to Huggies customers. Or the Pampers brand team could target loyal Pampers customers with messages on Facebook to encourage customer loyalty and the trial of new products in the extended Pampers line. Buying very targeted, smaller audiences resulted in higher CPMs (cost per thousand impressions), but not much else. These higher CPMs rank poorly in Media Mix Modeling (MMM) results, a method marketers use to attribute sales or other outcomes to different media investments. Note that this outcome of shifting to broader reach was for brands driving in-store purchase of lower-priced products, as opposed to direct-response advertising objectives. For direct-response ads selling products, online measurement is clearer from impression to purchase, and more specific targeting, even though it is more expensive, usually makes sense. Now many of the CPG brand marketers, such as P&G, that experimented with narrow audience targeting are recalibrating their strategies. Instead of targeting very specific, small groups of people, like pet owners, these marketers are building quality audiences on Facebook that are broad enough to reach more people, at a lower cost per person, and deliver measurable sales impact. Whether they are small or large, addressable audiences on global platforms like Facebook remain among the best digital channels. Broad, efficient and fraud-free reach to such massive audiences is a huge value proposition on its own. When you can reach three times the users at three times the cost efficiency, you can achieve real business impact. Balancing targeting with reach While there are many big brands in P&G’s scenario, there are many brands with niche audiences (craft beers, for example) that are experimenting with a concept we call “broad segmentation.” This involves applying the principles of broad, efficient CPMs, while concurrently deploying more personalized messaging and tailored media strategies against key customer segments within the broader group. To be sure, more precise targeting will always be hugely valuable for marketers and retailers engaging in direct-response advertising, like Verizon trying to sell phones and plans, Kayak selling hotel rooms and flights and Bloomingdales selling fashionable clothing. The right mix of reach versus targeting always depends on the specific brand, its category and its business goals. Opening up its targeting was the right call for P&G. Hundreds of SocialCode’s proprietary studies among Fortune 500 brand partners support this approach for large CPG brands. Advertisers that pair broadly targeted marketing buys with studies to measure what consumers are buying in stores often achieve sales lifts upward of 10 percent on a single digital campaign. This result is driven by increased purchase volume among existing customers, as well as by significant lift in new household sales and new customers. But the lesson is not to turn away from targeting–it is, instead, to validate strategic decisions and big media investments by measuring consumer lift. Advertisers and their partners must understand digital platforms well enough to capitalize on their mass reach and targetability–in unison—in order to maximize sales and return on investment.

P&G sues another razor manufacturer Brett Milam , bmilam@enquirer.com 1:20 p.m. EDT August 24, 2016 Procter & Gamble logo (Photo: Provided/P&G) Procter & Gamble filed a lawsuit Tuesday against one of its rivals, Edgewell Personal Care Co., claiming it falsely advertised one of its Schick razors as equal to or better than Gillette's Mach3 razors. The suit filed in U.S. District Court in New York City accuses Schick razors of patent infringement, unfair competition and false advertising against Gillette. Since 1998, when the Mach3 razor was introduced, sales have exceeded $5 billion, P&G claims in the complaint. Schick PL launched in June and the company, according to the complaint, claimed its blades can fit a Gillette Mach3 and that they include a gel to reduce irritation. Also in June, Gillette conducted blind testing on a group of males aged 18-55 comparing the shave provided by the Schick PL and the Mach3, the complaint said. "The results show that Schick PL creates a statistically significant number of greater nicks and cuts than Mach3," the complaint said. The complaint claimed the patent for the Mach3 expired on April 10, and to conceivably roll out the Schick PL by June, Edgewell would, "by necessity, have manufactured, imported, used and/or offered Schick PL for sale in the United States prior to patent expiration." In December 2015, Procter & Gamble sued Dollar Shave Club, claiming the digital startup was using its patented Gillette technology. That suit also involved the Mach3, specifically, an overcoat of chromium that keeps the blade sharper longer, which Dollar Shave Club was selling razors with such technology, the complained claimed. Dollar Shave Club filed a counter-claim against Procter & Gamble, saying it did not infringe on the patent. The case is still making its way through the court system. CINCINNATI.COM P&G sues razor rival P&G alleges that Edgewell has caused Gillette "irreparable injury." "Edgewell's actions threaten harm to Gillette's reputation and that of Mach3, thus jeopardizing Gillette's hard-earned standing and market share," the complaint said. The complaint stated that P&G is seeking corrective advertising, all profits and gains from this "unlawful conduct" and damages from Edgewell for patent infringement.

Have you looked at Lennar’s site plan for the huge gravel parking lot on Railroad Avenue and the lot adjacent to the Bankhead (www.cityoflivermore.net)? You really should. Mayor John Marchand, and City Council members Stu Gary and Laureen Turner voted against the motion of council members Steve Spedowfski and Bob Woerner to cut the 260 residential units by half or more before beginning parking, traffic, retail and environmental studies. While spokespeople for the Chamber of Commerce, Livermore Downtown, Livermore Valley Winegrowers, and Innovation Tri-Valley favor Lennar, hundreds of meeting attendees vehemently disagree. Why? People want Lennar’s condo canyon housing to go somewhere else. If housing is included, it should be luxury housing, reflecting the importance of the space. Many made heartfelt pleas for open space instead of the mass of concrete and five-story parking lots. Lennar crams too much into the space and ignores pedestrian flow, traffic flow, trash pickup and deliveries. Livermore residents, do you want our downtown to be Dublinized? Maryann Brent Livermore Regulate harmful chemicals out of consumer products The presence of potentially carcinogenic and harmful chemicals in the products that we use daily is very high in this day and age. Companies are allowed to use any chemical that they want without proper regulation or testing by the FDA. In particular, Procter & Gamble has been known to use harmful chemicals like ethylparaben, methylparaben and propylparaben in their products. Ethylparaben is a preservative that has been linked to hormone disruption. Personally I am extremely sensitive to hormonal disruptions. Many people, women in particular, have developed hormonal issues due to these toxins that we are exposed to daily. It is unnerving to think that everyday exposure to products like Neutrogena Oil-Free Moisture for Sensitive Skin could potentially be harming my health. It is time for P&G to switch to using toxic-free ingredients in their products. Madi Medearis Danville Livermore VA’s complimentary coffee is essential As a volunteer at the Veterans Affairs center in Livermore, I serve coffee and pastries every other Tuesday to the veterans who are there for medical appointments. I received a call on Aug. 8 from a VA employee telling me that there would be no coffee service the following day (Tuesday) as they were remodeling the small employee kitchen where we fill the coffee urn. I was advised by William Ball, the head of Volunteer Service for the Palo Alto VA System, that coffee service had not been available since last Friday. The excuse was that the pot was full of water since Friday and therefore could not be used because, I am guessing, the VA can’t figure out how to dump the existing water outside and refill with fresh water from one of dozens of sources of water at this facility. There are many veterans who come in on buses from outlying areas, and they look forward to the coffee and visits that take place in our small area. Many of our vets do not have the financial resources to buy coffee at the for-profit cafe. I realize that Ball and the other paid VA employees will not be inconvenienced by this and probably do not think that this is very important, but it is important to our vets. Every small kindness is greatly appreciated by the men and women we serve. Mr. Ball, can you spare a vet a cup of coffee? Jane Parish Danville Just how did the Clintons get rich? Secretary Hillary Clinton said she and her husband were broke and in debt when Bill left the White House, so please explain how the Clintons have built a net worth of over $100 million today. Ray Greer Danville Female president would be fine, but not corrupt Hillary I do not like Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump. However, rather than picking the lesser of the two evils or refraining from voting, I will vote for the Libertarian presidential candidate. That is the best way to signal to the Democrats and Republicans that both candidates are unacceptable. I would love to have a female president, but not one with Hillary’s long history of lies and corruption. I am a feminist, but I know that gender alone is not the best characteristic on which to base my choice. My first female boss was by far my worst boss in 35 years of working. She was a vicious, lying bully. I was very wary of ever working for another woman, but subsequently had male and female bosses who were good, bad and indifferent. It is the same with politicians. I want a good, honest woman for president and will wait to vote for a woman for president until there is a better female candidate. Eve Sprunt Dublin No chance of voting for Hillary Clinton It is a tragic loss for the Khan family to have lost their wonderful son, but it is no more of a loss than for all of the other families of Hispanic or black or Asian or Caucasian soldiers. It matters not the ethnicity of those lost. All are mourned. Where was Hillary Clinton 12 years ago when Humayun Khan was killed? Did she mourn him then? Did she mourn him eight years ago when she was trying to win the Democratic nomination? How many researchers did she use to find a Muslim soldier who had given his life in the line of duty? Was it not Clinton who voted for the Iraq War? Was it not Clinton who put the security of all Americans at risk when she used an unsecured email while in at-risk countries all for the benefit of her own secret emails? Was it not Clinton who made the decision to delete emails that she wanted unread and known by the U.S. government? Vote for Hillary Clinton? Not on your life. Maureen McLaughlin Concord Why do Democrats discredit their own? Recent articles have dealt with voter fraud. Contra Costa County Registrar of Voters Joe Canciamilla came forth with the number of people who used a loophole allowing them to vote twice. By itself that’s not noteworthy, but that was just one county, and those were just the ones that got caught. The next article contained the effort by the California secretary of state’s office to quickly and vehemently deny Canciamilla’s findings. They did so even before checking into Canciamilla’s data. Over the years, Canciamilla, a Democrat, has shown that he is a trustworthy and reliable civil servant. But the top political office in the state, dominated by Democrats, thinks the current setup is working just fine. A final article revealed the Obama administration’s unusual step of joining in a lawsuit and helping to repeal a Texas law that requires voters to show one of seven allowable types of identification. It seems the Democrat agenda is always against measures that reduce voter fraud. Do they feel that the only way they can win is by cheating?

Gillette sues Chesterfield-based Edgewell over competing razor claims Reuters Aug 23, 2016 (…) Procter & Gamble's Gillette unit has sued Chesterfield-based Edgewell Personal Care Co. over claims made about its Mach3 razors. NEW YORK • Procter & Gamble Co.’s Gillette unit on Tuesday sued the maker of Schick razors, claiming it falsely marketed a line of private label three-blade razors and cartridges as being equal to or better than its popular Mach3. Gillette said tests of men aged 18 to 55 showed that razors from Chesterfield-based Edgewell Personal Care Co. created a “statistically significant number of greater nicks and cuts,” and thus were not “as good or better than Mach3,” as their labels claim. “By falsely promoting its razor as being ‘as good or better’ than Mach3 and providing reduced irritation as compared to Mach3, Edgewell’s actions threaten harm to Gillette’s reputation and that of Mach3, thus jeopardizing Gillette’s hard-earned standing and market share,” the complaint said. The complaint filed in Manhattan federal court also said that the “many months” of lead time needed for Edgewell’s June rollout of its shaving products meant that company had to infringe three patents for the Mach3 that expired on April 10. Edgewell denied the allegations. “Gillette’s Mach3 patents have expired and we are confident in the quality and performance of our private label products,” the company said Tuesday in an emailed statement. “We will vigorously defend ourselves against these meritless claims and will continue to support our valued customers around the world. Gillette, which is based in Boston, dominates the retail market for men’s razors and blades, where it can charge higher prices for premium brands such as Mach3 and Fusion. But it faces pressure from lower-cost rivals and online sales. The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages, a halt to alleged false advertising and royalties for products sold under such names as Blade, Daylogic and Equate, and by Kroger Co. According to the complaint, Edgewell told Gillette that its claims for the private label razors were based on a “well conducted product test” and had offered to substantiate the “as good or better” claim to retailers that asked.

Though by no means flashy, Kimberly Clark's consistent, steady approach makes it a dividend powerhouse capable of standing the test of time. Andrew Tonner (TMFTheDude) Aug 24, 2016 at 7:30PM Image source: Getty Images. You don't increase your dividend for 43 consecutive years without doing something right. In the unsexy but lucrative world of dividend investing, Kimberly-Clark (NYSE:KMB) is a rare breed of company. Few corporations are lucky enough to remain in operation for nearly 150 years, making Kimberly-Clark stock's history and dividend track record both outliers in the extreme. So, what makes Kimberly-Clark such a remarkable stock for long-term investors? Let's find out. Breaking down Kimberly-Clark's stock history As should come as no surprise, Kimberly-Clark's long history rests upon decades of exceptional performance. Companies simply don't stay in business for so long unless they're doing something right. As such, it comes as no surprise that Kimberly-Clark stock has outperformed the broader market since its public debut: KMB data by YCharts. In recent years, however, much like its rivals Procter & Gamble and Unilever, Kimberly-Clark's business has shown signs of maturing. Though by no means a negative for investors, it's important to understand how exactly Kimberly-Clark generates its returns. Here's a snapshot of Kimberly-Clark's average 10-year performance across several key financial drivers, as defined by the company: Metric  Sales Growth Organic Sales Growth EPS Growth Kimberly-Clark Corporation Goal 3%-5% 3%-5% 5%-8% Kimberly-Clark Corporation Actual 3% 4% 6% Data source: Kimberly-Clark Corporation. Note: Above percentages represent 2004-15 averages. Kimberly-Clark closely tracks these metrics to ensure the company continues to deliver on its long-term strategic objectives as defined in the company's Global Business Plan. Developed in 2003, Kimberly-Clark's strategy rests on four main priorities: "Manage its brand portfolio to balance growth, profitability, and cash flow." "Invest in brands, innovation, and growth initiatives." "Deliver sustainable cost reduction." "Utilize disciplined capital management to improve ROIC and return cash to shareholders." All told, the company has made good on these mandates. In addition to meeting its stated targets above, Kimberly-Clark also maintained its capital investments within their desired range, while improving its ROIC about 75 basis points each year. Many of these traits are hallmarks of mature consumer staples companies like Kimberly-Clark. However, this formula of continued optimization and returning ample capital to shareholders, though by no means flashy, is a tried-and-true method for producing compelling returns for shareholders. Kimberly-Clark, dividend dynamo At its advanced age, Kimberly-Clark's strategy for success lies in consistent and slightly above-average performance as the secret sauce to its longtime market-beating success. Chief among them, the company's dividend growth prowess is critical for shareholders seeking both passive income and long-term capital appreciation. Thankfully for its investors, Kimberly-Clark's dividend growth also remains substantially superior to the broad market.  Metric Current Yield Long-Term Annual Growth Rate Kimberly-Clark Dividend 2.9% 8% S&P 500 Dividend 2% 5.9% Difference 0.9% 2.1% Data source: Kimberly-Clark investor relations, multpl.com.  Thanks to the magic of compounding interest, while these differences may seem small, they make a big difference over time. For example, a lump some of $1,000 growing at Kimberly-Clark's 8% growth rate will be worth slightly over $10,000 in 30 years, whereas the S&P 500's growth rate would result in that same $1,000 increasing to only $5,500. This also overlooks the effect of the differences in the two securities' current yields, which would have a further magnifying effect in Kimberly-Clark's favor. Kimberly-Clark is the kind of consistent, steady investment that conservative, long-term investors should love. It's unlikely to wow you in any one given year, but thanks to its consistent adherence to long-term dividend growth and business improvements, investors willing to buy and hold shares in this high-quality company are likely to be glad they did.

Addressing a workshop on Urban Transformation through Administrative Reform and New Approach at Administrative Staff College here attended by the representatives of urban bodies, Sonowal advised them to plant fruit-bearing trees and medicinal plants to earn additional revenue. "Ramdev's company has an annual turnover of Rs 10,000 crore. His company needs a large number of medicinal fruits like xilikha (myrobalan), amlokhi (amla) and omora (hog plum). You can think of it as a measure to earn revenue," he said. Sonowal cited the example of Delhi Municipal Corporation which had taken a similar route to add to its coffers. He said in the last financial year, the Delhi corporation earned Rs 10 crore by selling bor jamuk (Indian blackberries) alone. According to reports, Patanjali Ayurved is targeting Rs 10,000-crore revenue in the current fiscal after sales grew 150 per cent in the previous financial year to Rs 5,000 crore. The Hardwar-based "swadeshi" company has multinationals like Nestle, Colgate-Palmolive and Procter & Gamble in India in its sights. Sonowal's preference for Baba Ramdev's company is understandable given the televangelist's matching political leanings. Ramdev has only received kindness from Assam ever since the BJP-led government assumed office. The Bodoland Territorial Council "offered" over 3,800 bighas of land to his company to set up a unit in the Bodoland Territorial Area Districts (BTAD). The Bodoland People's Front, which heads the council, is an ally of the BJP. Patanjali Ayurved Ltd plans to set up several manufacturing units across the country during this financial year. Sonowal asked the urban bodies' representatives to increase revenue and requested them not to consider the poor financial condition of the government as a hindrance to their work. "It is not money, but qualities like your willingness, hard work and honestly that can really keep the town clean. Think of the responsibility people have bestowed on you, involve citizens and keep working," he said. Sonowal, who arrived an hour late, promised the representatives that the state government would introduce three services within six months in order to bring efficiency in the functioning of the urban bodies. He asked chief secretary V.K. Pipersenia to finalise all the formalities. The three services are - urban administrative service, urban engineer and planner service and urban finance and accounts service. "For proper functioning of a town body you need to have sufficient knowledge and expertise like how they are administered and how revenue are generated and spent. To help you all I have promised you to introduce these three services within six months."  More stories in North East Champion goes missing Green tribunal raps refinery Kuldeep rescue efforts on Plan to bridge digital divide Nath new top cop of city Rally against drugs Sarma sermon on schemes Of roots and identity NGO plea to stop illegal tobacco sale Blame game begins over clashes Rights groups decry attack Teri proposes ways for inclusive growth NPF blows poll bugle Forum focus on women's safety Manipur constable aspirants call strike Teachers withdraw protest Conrad slams govt over funds 10-year RI for three peddlers Rousing reception for Ripun in Barak Valley Push for air, road links via Bangladesh to Bengal    Copyright © 2016 The Telegraph.

Here are my rules to prepare Abigail Stevenson | @A_StevensonCNBC Wednesday, 24 Aug 2016 | 6:12 PM ETCNBC.com SHARES show chapters Cramer: Next flash crash will happen. Here are my rules to prepare    Wednesday, 24 Aug 2016 | 6:00 PM ET | 11:34 In the past six years there have been two flash crashes, including one that occurred exactly a year ago in 2015. Jim Cramer will be ready for the next one, and wants investors to be prepared, too. "Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, and I'm an idiot who deserves the heat," the "Mad Money" host said. The term flash crash refers a special event when the stock market drops quickly, almost in the blink of an eye. It can result in a dramatic loss of about 1,000 points on the Dow. Both flash crashes had a similar theme: something negative overseas either triggered, or was thought to trigger an event in the U.S. that investors couldn't grasp. It caused an immense amount of fear and paralysis. In Cramer's perspective, it's not a matter of if a flash crash will happen again, it's a matter of when. So, to prepare investors, Cramer outlined his rules for the next flash crash. Getty Images A trader works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on August 24, 2015 in New York City. No. 1 Never use market orders. A market order is an order to buy or sell a stock executed at the current market price. Market orders can be messy, and have no specific price allocated, so investors can get crushed by machine algorithms, Cramer said. That is why he recommended limit orders, which is an order for a set amount of securities at a specific price, or better. In the flash crash of 2010, Cramer monitored Procter & Gamble to buy for his charitable trust. After all, if Greece was really the reason for the flash crash back then, people would still need to shave and wash their clothes. "When you suspect that you've got a flash crash on your hands, you need to be ready with your own Procter & Gamble-like ideas," Cramer said. No. 2 Have multiple stock ideas. Investors cannot just reach for a Procter & Gamble, because some stocks will crash harder than others, and no one knows which ones they will be. Cramer recommended high-quality stocks with little economic sensitivity. Those are the ones left standing once the smoke clears and have a history of being able to pay dividends no matter what. For instance, General Mills paid its dividends through two world wars, the Great Depression and Great Recession. Stocks like PepsiCo, Dominion Resources, American Electric Power, Verizon and AT&T all landed on Cramer's radar. "When the next flash crash occurs, we might not have the luxury to step off the desk to make calls. We may not be able to see Procter trading down," Cramer said, "But we will be ready, and yes, we will even be salivating for the next flash crash so we can brag that not only were we there, we made a killing."

Photo: Paul Warner/Getty Images Now that the Rio Olympics are over, it's time for the world's top athletes to take on an entirely different (and presumably far less exciting) challenge: returning to normal life. And for many, this means switching back from spandex (in some cases, extremely sparkly spandex) to regular-person clothes. Of course, everyday style differs from athlete to athlete, so we asked P&G-sponsored sports stars Allyson Felix, who took home the gold in the women’s 4x400 relay and the silver in the women’s 400-meter race, and April Ross, bronze medalist in the women’s beach volleyball doubles tournament, what they prefer to wear when off the clock. We also spoke with Final Five member Aly Raisman, who won silver in the women’s gymnastics all-around competition and serves as an ambassador for Aeropostale's ultra-stretchy (of course!) denim offerings. Below, their thoughts on on- and off-duty style and beauty, including Allyson’s tips on picking the perfect running shoe and Aly’s topknot tutorial. Spoiler: she uses nine elastics. NINE. What’s your style like when you're not competing or training? Allyson: "Los Angeles’s laid-back attitude can be seen in my style both on and off the track. My style during my days off is comfortable and simple, with an edge. I enjoy mixing up styles to complement different pieces of my outfit. If the main focus is on my sneakers, I will keep the rest of my outfit simple. Most people see me in training and competition gear, so I think it’s always a surprise when people see me off the track and dressed up a bit – whether I'm going out with friends or family or to a formal event or concert. Off the track, my style varies a bit. Sometimes I will go for the elegant, timeless pieces and other times I will grab something more interesting or in a bold color." Aly: "I like stretchy jeans because they’re good for any body type. A lot of athletes struggle to find clothes that fit them well. Like, my waist is really tiny but then I’m muscular, so it’s hard to find the right fit, but these are really great. Now that I’m taking a little bit of a break from gymnastics, I’ll be wearing denim every day." April: "I describe my style as beachy feminine. I like to wear my favorite Ralph Lauren jean shorts with a girly, flowy top. I look forward to getting a little bit more dressed up – wearing a dress and some heels and spending more time on my hair and makeup when my husband and I go out to dinner." April, how do you keep yourself protected from too much sun? April: "The best sunglasses for sports, especially beach volleyball, are the Oakley Jawbreakers – I love those. [And to protect my hair,] I always wear a visor!" Allyson, what do you look for in a running shoe? Allyson: "I look for a shoe that has a great fit, flexibility, and strength, and is lightweight. Recently, I have been competing in my Nike Zoom Superfly Flyknits. I worked with their research lab to create this spike which is specific to body as well as my races’ needs and requirements. Their engineers know the science and performance innovation behind a great shoe and I always feel confident running with their shoes." Aly, how do you get that perfect topknot? Aly: "So what I do is I wet my hands first — I don’t completely wet my hair because then it’ll be too heavy. But I wet my hair [using my hands], put some hairspray in it, and put it in a ponytail first. A really high ponytail. I’ll do two elastics in the ponytail so that it’s tight, and then I’ll twist my hair and wrap it around and put one hair elastic in, and then fill the rest with bobby pins so you get all the little flyaways. And then I do a couple more hair elastics so that it stays. It doesn’t have to be the same amount every time, but it’s probably around eight or nine [elastics]." April, what’s your beauty routine like? April: "It’s pretty minimal. I’ll apply sunscreen and put on a bit of Covergirl Lashblast Volume waterproof mascara, and that’s it! After competing, I use Aussie 3 Minute Miracle Moist to help make my hair look shiny, healthy and moisturized again. My hair takes quite a beating between the sun, sand, and sweat, and I don’t usually have the energy or time to put a lot of effort into making it look great again, so that’s an essential for me! [On my days off] I’ll spend more time doing my hair and will use some more product – usually the Aussie Sprunch Mousse to define my curls more. But I’m very simple!"

Procter & Gamble (P&G) led the pack, by a large margin, with more than twice as many recruiters ranking them #1 over the second best firm—Pepsico. In order to survey executive recruiters who specifically place C-level marketers, Forbes contributor and assistant professor at the University of Virginia's Darden School of Business Kimberly A. Whitler collaborated with Christine DeYoung, partner at DHR International, a senior-level executive search, management assessment and succession planning company. The 2016 survey includes executive recruiter responses who represent 19 different firms (including boutique, mid-sized, and large recruiting firms) and have placed over 2600 C-level marketing leaders during the course of their careers. Respondents suggested that Procter and Gamble’s “systematic and disciplined” P&L training, their emphasis on holding marketers accountable for total business results, and the firm’s track record for developing successful C-level leaders puts them at the top of the list. The balance of the top 5 ranked firms were consumer packaged goods (CPG) firms: Pepsico, Coca-Cola, Unilever, General Mills, etc. Of note, while Kraft is listed according to its current company name (KraftHeinz), almost all executive recruiters who identified Kraft as one of the best companies only used the Kraft name. The Companies That Develop The Best C-Level Marketing Leaders 1. P&G 2. Pepsico 3. Coca-Cola 4. Unilever 5. General Mills 6. KraftHeinz 7. American Express 8. Apple 9. Starbucks 10. Johnson & Johnson 11. Nestlé 12. Nike 13. Amazon 14. Clorox 15. Yum! Brands When asked to describe the attributes of the firms that are best at developing marketing talent, the open-ended responses centered on 7 factors.

Photo: Priyanka Parashar/Mint New Delhi: Hamdard Laboratories founder Unani practitioner Hakeem Hafiz Abdul Majeed, who created Rooh Afza, once retraced its advent to the time when “the motor car was on its way in and the horse buggy on its way out”. The rose-flavoured cooling drink, introduced in 1907, has survived the partition, the era of the licence raj, carbonated drinks and Tetra Pak juices. But it hasn’t been “cool” among the millennials—people who reached adulthood around 2000. Sales suffered because of outdated packaging, indifferent marketing and limited distribution, centered in north India. The Waqf (Islamic irrevocable trust) that manages Hamdard Laboratories initially didn’t want to accept this thesis, until the younger generation joined the Islamic trust. Hamdard Laboratories, maker of Safi blood purifier and Cinkara tonic, besides Rooh Afza, is finally set for an overhaul. Its new buzzwords are modern packaging, smaller pack sizes, ready-to-drink beverages, natural personal care products, aggressive marketing and distribution, coupled with disruptive communication. The agenda is to be relevant to young consumers while leveraging its more than century-old legacy. Hamdard wants to establish itself as a company that sells food and personal care products made of “only natural ingredients.” The aim is to cross Rs.1,000 crore in annual sales by March 2019 from Rs.610 crore in the year ended 31 March 2016. “It’s all about positioning. People, essentially the youth, are turning to natural products. And they are more health conscious,” said Mansoor Ali, Hamdard’s chief sales and marketing officer. “For more than a century, we have been selling products made of natural ingredients. What they need is proper positioning through marketing and modern packaging. We need to position ourselves to be more relevant for the young,” he added. Hamdard’s best bet, naturally, is Rooh Afza. “By March 2019, it will cross Rs.500 crore (in sales). We are targeting Rooh Afza to touch Rs.300 crore sales by March 2017. Safi is estimated to reach Rs.100 crore sales by the end of this fiscal year,” said Ali, who joined Hamdard in January 2015. Ali has earlier worked with companies like Procter & Gamble Co. and Reckitt Benckiser of India Ltd, among others. He hired people from other packaged goods companies to run Hamdard’s day-to-day business. “The company is now run by seasoned professionals,” he said. Over the next couple of quarters, Hamdard will launch smaller packs, ready-to-drink variants like milkshakes, new flavours, even a sugar-free version of Rooh Afza, and energy drinks, which will be sold in PET bottles and Tetra Pak containers. “We will also be pushing our products through modern trade and e-commerce channels. We need to establish Rooh Afza as a season-agnostic beverage,” said Ali. Not just Rooh Afza. There will be new products under all the brands of Hamdard—Safi, Roghan Badam Shirin (almond oil), Sualin (cold and cough remedy) and Cinkara (health tonic). “For instance, we are planning to bring personal care products under Safi. Plans are being finalized,” said Ali. At present, about 45% of Hamdard’s revenue comes from the northern India, primarily Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Haryana. The company has started tapping markets in the eastern region and is gearing up to enter the west and south. Its manufacturing plants are located in Delhi, Manesar (Harnaya) and Ghaziabad (Uttar Pradesh). The company is looking to increase capacity at these plants and may set up a new production unit for personal care products. Investments, said Ali, would not be an issue. “About 85% of profit still goes to charity. And the Board (Waqf) has agreed to invest as required,” he added. At present, its products are available across 450,000 retail outlets. Its heritage may be an advantage but it needs greater visibility, said Sachin Bobade, a Mumbai-based equity analyst. “...Hamdard’s products need to be seen—not just in stores, but also across mass media. Today’s generation is unlikely to have any knowledge about the brand. Without a doubt, Hamdard has good potential for growth. But it needs to be visible first..,” he added. This year, Hamdard will spend about 15% of annual revenue on advertising. “We are not going for celebrity endorsements. Differentiated, disruptive communication without shift away from the core, more focus on digital and consumer engagement is the way forward,” said Ali. The firm has engaged Rediffusion Y&R as its creative agency while Delhi-based Sterco Digitex has been given the mandate for digital communication. Santosh Desai, brand expert and chief executive and managing director, Future Brands Ltd, said that to stay relevant and connect with young consumers, heritage brands often commit a common mistake of trying to appear to be cool. “It doesn’t work. Companies must have belief in their heritage instead of running away from it. Baba Ramdev’s Patanjali Ayurved, for instance, is not trying to be a cool brand, and its popularity shows its relevance,” he said. Hamdard should find a way to frame its timeless appeal in the current context. “Clearly, there is a consumer shift from aerated to health drinks. Hamdard’s Rooh Afza can be relevant if the company manages to tap into the modern health discourse and leverage it,” added Desai. Hamdard, meanwhile, is setting up wellness centres to popularize Unani as a nature cure method. “We have already set up six wellness centres. We’ll have 10 by end of the year across the country. These wellness centres will sell all company products— medicines, personal care products and beverages, besides offering remedies and therapies by qualified doctors,” said Ali. Desai said heritage works in the wellness sector, citing the example of the ayurvedic Kerala massage that is an extremely old therapy, yet remains popular in contemporary times. “A wellness centre, in Hamdard’s case, should be a way to amplify its past, not escape it,” added Desai.

Now P&G has drafted Von Miller, fresh off his dancing lesson in Heat’s “Start Me” spot for Madden NFL 17, as the face of Old Spice for the 2016 season, promoting the brand’s Hardest Working collection.  Adweek broke the story this morning, but we get all our important news from celebrities’ Twitter accounts. Yep! This just happened. Repping the Hardest Working Collection for @OldSpice. pic.twitter.com/CdaWYGxD3V — Von Miller (@Millerlite40) August 23, 2016 The first spots starring Miller, presumably from W+K, are expected early in the NFL season. For now, though, there are series of photos starring Miller promoting the brand—in his Broncos jersey, naturally. “We’re excited to welcome Von, one of the NFL’s top-performing players and unique personalities, to the Old Spice family,” added Old Spice brand director Janine Miletic. “Von’s engaging, humorous demeanor and hardworking on-field performance align perfectly with our ridiculously masculine brand and the performance of our Hardest Working Collection combining our most popular scents with our most powerful sweat and odor protection and deep cleansing body washes.” “Between winning the Super Bowl, solidifying my status with the Broncos and being named the newest Old Spice guy, 2016 is shaping up to be quite a year,” Miller said in a statement. “I’ve had my favorite Old Spice scents for a long time, and I only trust the Hardest Working Collection to give me a deep clean after practices and keep me smelling fresh on and off the field. There’s a reason you find Old Spice in every team’s locker room.” Dude never gets a break. And we do not in any way believe his last sentence. < Previous Article Next Article > Advertisement Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

Credit: Huddle More like this Box competitor Huddle makes two announcements during Box’s show week Egnyte moves beyond file sharing and sync Dropbox goes enterprise (again). Too little, too late? Video How the FCC fast-tracked its journey to the cloud File synchronization and sharing vendor Huddle is today announcing enhanced security for external collaboration. While only a moderately interesting announcement in and of itself, it comes at an interesting time for the broader enterprise file sharing and sync (EFSS) space. Gartner's recent report indicated a difficult road ahead for the myriad vendors in the space and pronounced that many players simply would not exist in the future. Too many players battling in a largely undifferentiated product space and for a significant but not unlimited market makes for some interesting tensions. Add to that the fact that there is a perennial dance between those vendors who have been enterprise-focused since the get-go, and those who have moved into the enterprise space from a consumer origin, and you have room for lots of carnage. Huddle, while denouncing the EFSS moniker, is essentially in the space -- and while it calls itself a cloud collaboration service, essentially it's the same thing. Huddle does have an interesting origin, having been founded in the U.K. and gaining significant traction in that market before making a move to the U.S. Indeed, one of Huddle's earliest inflection points came when it was selected as a whole-of-government provider to the U.K. public sector. Since then, it has picked up a range of customers on both sides of the Atlantic -- from a claimed 80% of the Fortune 500 to companies such as Kia Motors, Williams Lea, Driscoll's, Unilever and P&G. Of course, as I mentioned, it is a busy space, and Huddle does battle with the publicly listed Box.com (formerly a consumer-focused play but now moved upmarket), Dropbox (still privately held but unlikely to remain that way for long and a strong consumer play trying to make it in the grownup enterprise world), Egnyte (which uses hybrid deployment as its differentiator), and other vendors such as Citrix Sharefile, Accellion, and the big boys Google and Microsoft. So anything one of these vendors does gets observed within the context of a far greater story. And so the announcement of a seemingly minor security update is cause for interest. In this case, Huddle is making its "Unified Authentication Portal" a generally available product. With the change, account managers can apply authentication and security policies such as single sign-on (SSO) across Huddle's web, desktop and mobile apps in one step, hopefully simplifying the process of keeping content secure. Coupled with more granular permissions control and additional mobile security features, enterprises now have even greater control over internal and external access to content in Huddle. Of course, there is a risk in making a big song and dance about functionality that many top-tier customers would regard as basic features. This is a problem not only for Huddle, but also its competitors that need to be constantly talking about their "enterprise-ready" products while also making a fuss about deeper functional releases. Huddle admits these security concerns from its users and prospects. "Security is a top concern for most enterprises; however, this is especially true of professional services firms who are collaborating with internal and external stakeholders on a regular basis," said Stuart Cochran, the CTO of Huddle. "In our latest release, we've doubled down on our commitment to being the industry's most secure cloud-collaboration platform, making it even easier to keep data secure regardless of who has access. This is especially important, particularly when the success of an engagement depends on efficient collaboration and communications between internal teams, the clients and other external partners." This is an important level of functionality for larger customers, but it is unlikely to fundamentally alter the difficult dynamics around the EFSS market -- there are too many vendors fighting too many battles in what is, essentially, an undifferentiated commodity race. I'm not sure whether the answer will come in the form of failed vendors, market consolidation or both. Either way, the next few years are going to be fascinating to watch.

However, in the current stock market, it’s important for investors not to simply chase high dividends without looking at other metrics. Consider that many big-name consumer staples and utility stocks are trading for sky­high price­to­earnings ratios right now. Consolidated Edison, Inc. (ED) trades for a forward P/E of almost 18 and Procter & Gamble Co. (PG) trades for a forward P/E of almost 21. That’s a big premium to pay for income. And even if you’re getting modest dividends, you may eventually suffer a steep decline in your initial investment because you bought at too high of a price. Why are these sleepy stocks trading for such a premium? Well, because in the current low­interest rate environment, everyone is piling into the same large­cap dividend names in search of income.The best dividend stocks to buy right now, however, are not the names you’ve heard of like P&G or ConEd. Instead, they are lesser­-known mid­caps that still throw off substantial annual dividend payouts. Here they are: the seven best dividend stocks you’ve never heard of. Owens & Minor Dividend Yield: 3% YTD Performance: ­7% vs. +6% for the S&P 500 Market Cap: $2.1 billion Industry: Medical Equipment Advertisement Owens & Minor, Inc. (OMI) is a global healthcare services company that focuses on distribution of medical supplies and logistics. Running the supply chain for hospitals and clinics isn’t glamorous work; it’s a behind-­the-­scenes business. However, OMI has a robust list of reliable clients, and that adds up to reliable revenue to fuel a dividend that is almost twice the current rate of return on 10­-year Treasuries. With a payout ratio of 51% ($1.02 annually on projected earnings of $2.01 next fiscal year), there is ample room for future increases. See Also from Kiplinger: 5 Dividend Stocks to Consider Selling Tanger Factory Outlet Centers Dividend Yield: 3.3% YTD Performance: +21% Market Cap: $3.8 billion Industry: Commercial real estate Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc. (SKT) is a real estate investment trust (REIT) that focuses on shopping centers, mainly in the U.S. While malls aren’t exactly booming in the era of e­commerce, the value proposition of outlets continues to generate reliable business for tenants — and reliable rent checks for Tanger. In January, the stock just boosted its dividend about 14%. Advertisement See Also from InvestorPlace: 7 Dividend Stocks That Really Crank Out the Cash SKT continues to buy out partners and consolidate power in the outlet segment, as evidenced by acquiring 100% ownership of a Savannah outlet a few weeks ago. This REIT is well­positioned to be the major (if not only) lessor in the space. Compass Minerals Dividend Yield: 3.9% YTD Performance: ­3% Market Cap: $2.5 billion Industry: Chemicals Compass Minerals International Inc. (CMP) produces the plant fertilizer potash as well as rock salts and chemical road deicers for municipalities. It certainly isn’t a glamorous business, and anyone who remembers the great global potash crash of 2013 after a breakup of a Russian fertilizer cartel knows that this sector has been under big pressure in recent years. Advertisement However, CMP stock has right­sized for the current environment — all while pushing dividends higher. In fact, its payout has soared in 55% in the last five years, from 45 cents quarterly to about 70 cents currently. Revenue should climb about 7% next year and profits are expected to surge 30%, so the worst may be behind this stock. Mercury General Dividend Yield: 4.8% YTD Performance: +12% Market Cap: $2.9 billion Industry: Insurance Mercury General Corporation (MCY) is an insurance company that serves 10 states, mainly writing auto policies but also insuring a modest amount of homeowners and businesses. Advertisement Anyone interested in income knows that the reliable cash flow from insurance policies can power a reliable dividend machine. In fact, this characteristic is one of the reasons that investing icon Warren Buffett loves insurers like Geico so much. See Also from InvestorPlace: 7 Dividend-Paying Energy Stocks to Tap Into Now! MCY is a smaller company and not as well­ known, but follows the same model. Old Republic Dividend Yield: 4% YTD Performance: +1% Market Cap: $4.9 billion Industry: Insurance Old Republic International Corporation (ORI) is another insurance company that focuses mainly on property and liability coverage to businesses, governments and institutions. ORI has paid dividends since 1942, and just recently declared its 35th consecutive annual increase in payouts. Furthermore, it’s trading for just a 10% premium above book value and a forward P/E of less than 14! If you’re looking for a reliable mid­cap dividend payer that is trading at a bargain valuation, you can’t do much better than ORI. Flowers Foods Dividend Yield: 4.2% YTD Performance: ­29% Market Cap: $3.2 billion Industry: Bakery foods Flowers Foods, Inc. (FLO) is a baked goods company behind bread brands Nature’s Own, Sunbeam and Wonder Bread as well as Mrs. Freshley’s and Tastykake snacks. The company isn’t exactly booming growth­wise, as evidenced by its significant decline in the past year or so. But FLO stock just raised its dividend 10% — and despite this decent bump, it’s only paying out 65% of earnings (64 cents annually on projected earnings of 97 cents next fiscal year). See Also from InvestorPlace: 7 Stocks to Sell or Short Into the Ground Unlike other staples stocks with a nosebleed P/E, Flowers is trading for less than 16 times next year’s earnings, making it not just a good dividend stock, but a good value play too. Garmin Dividend Yield: 3.8% YTD Performance: +46% Market Cap: $10.2 billion Industry: Consumer technology Garmin Ltd. (GRMN) is indeed the GPS company you may remember from 10 years ago, back when those devices were ubiquitous and cell phones weren’t providing us with directions thanks to Google Maps. However, the company has successfully transitioned away from those old gadgets into onboard and in­dash GPS systems for autos, as well as marine navigation and airline mapping systems. There’s also a reasonably successful consumer arm with gadgets like the Vivosmart fitness wearable, which monitors (among other things) how far you run using GPS tracking. Garmin is a company that has evolved, but continues to do right by shareholders via a juicy dividend.

Peltz Los Angeles Times When the Summer Olympics end Sunday, the clock starts ticking for medal winners hoping to cash in on their glory. Other than established multimillionaire stars such as U.S. swimmer Michael Phelps and Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt, the Olympians have a brief window of opportunity -- most likely a few weeks -- to sign potentially lucrative endorsement deals once the Games are over. A handful might profit handsomely, notably gymnast Simone Biles, who arrived in Rio de Janeiro with endorsements already in hand and then captured the nation's attention by winning four gold medals and one bronze. But most medalists won't get rich from their efforts because corporations looking for celebrity endorsers know that the athletes -- and their Olympic sports held only once every four years -- don't maintain the attention paid to traditional sports such as football and baseball, experts said. "Very few of them" will attain significant wealth from the Rio Games, said Ben Sturner, chief executive of Leverage Agency, a sports and entertainment marketing firm. "The news media will not be covering you three or four weeks from now." That's especially true with the Summer Olympics, said Matt Delzell, managing director at the Marketing Arm, a sports marketing agency. "The shelf life is so short for Summer Olympians because the timing is so bad," he said. "We're two weeks away from college football and the NFL, and the Major League Baseball playoffs are soon, so it's a terrible time for the Olympic athletes to make hay in the spotlight. "Most marketers know that Katie Ledecky's name, come January, sadly is going to be a whole lot lesser known than it is now," even though the swimmer captured four gold medals in Brazil, Delzell said. It's a moot point at the moment for Ledecky, who has opted to attend college and maintain her amateur status. But Biles -- a three-time world champion -- and others chose to turn professional, with Biles dropping plans to attend UCLA. Biles, 19, had inked endorsement deals before the Olympics began, including a television commercial for Procter & Gamble Co.'s Tide detergent that ran during the games, and her net worth already tops $2 million, according to MoneyNation.com. Biles and four other athletes also have been on the front and back covers of various Kellogg Co. cereal boxes since mid-June, extending the decades-old tradition of Olympic athletes being featured on cereal boxes. But for most Olympians, "it's just tough" to land sponsorship deals, not only because they're no longer on television but also because they're less likely to maintain the buzz on social media that advertisers now crave, said Matt Balvanz, vice president for analytics at Navigate Research. "What are the social-media conversations about these athletes and how soon do they fall off? Two weeks out, no one will be talking about them," Balvanz said. None of the medal winners in Rio returns home empty handed, however. The United States Olympic Committee pays bonuses -- $25,000 for each gold medal, $15,000 for silver and $10,000 for bronze -- that can be accepted by amateur students such as Ledecky under NCAA rules. Certain sports federations also pay bonuses to American medal winners. The USA Wrestling Foundation, for instance, is handing out a sizable $250,000 for gold medalists in Rio, along with $50,000 for silver and $25,000 for bronze. The Olympic gold medals themselves, which are 85 millimeters in diameter and weigh 500 grams, are valued at about $564 apiece, based on the recent price of gold, according to Forbes. That's well below the record price of $708 for the 2012 Olympics in London, when gold and silver prices were higher. Each gold medal, produced by the Mint of Brazil, actually is mostly made of silver and plated with six grams of gold. If the entire medal was made of gold, it would be valued at nearly $22,000. That's still small change compared with a multimillion-dollar shoe or apparel contract that a select few, such as Phelps, have been able to command. But this year, "is anybody going to make seven-figure endorsements from these Olympics? I doubt it," Delzell said. Phelps reportedly has a net worth of $55 million, and Bolt's reportedly tops $60 million, in good part because they've had long, superlative careers spanning more than one Olympics. That's kept them relevant with consumers, analysts said. Yet even if other athletes don't hit the endorsement jackpot immediately after these Olympics, they can still build a career from their momentary brilliance at the Games, said Rob Prazmark, chief executive of 21 Sports & Entertainment Market Group. Some Olympic athletes find ways to stay in the public's eye -- and thus relevant for endorsements from corporations -- by appearing on TV shows, making public appearances or joining the broadcasting field. "Dancing with the Stars," for instance, has become a destination for former Olympians such as soccer player Hope Solo, figure skater Kristi Yamaguchi and speed skater Apolo Anton Ohno. "Don't measure it by how much money they make this year," Prazmark said. "Their value as an Olympian doesn't end after they win gold, it's how they work their Olympic achievements. You don't have to be Michael Phelps to make a career out of being an Olympian."       Comments made about this article - 0 Total Comment on this article Title: Comments: Your Name: (optional - shown on website) Advertisement Subscribe to The Recorder   E-Edition 11/23/2016 Click here to see and download more print issues The Recorder Sports Schedule Most Popular Area high school sports calendar Monday, November 21, 2016 Volunteers to cook up holiday spirit in city with meal delivery Saturday, November 19, 2016 Experienced core will be key for Northville Friday, November 18, 2016 Mayfield returns four starters; also has talented 6-foot-5 eighth grader in the mix Tuesday, November 22, 2016 Fulton County supervisors give approval to $97M draft budget Friday, November 18, 2016 From The Recorder Archives Saturday, November 19, 2016 Thomas to replace Cramer as undersheriff Saturday, November 19, 2016 Sophie Malkowicz Friday, November 18, 2016 City gun buyback yields less, but still viewed as a success Thursday, November 17, 2016 Police report Friday, November 18, 2016 Isabel faces Nelson for county legislature District 8 seat (1) Jury convicts Thomas Mair of murdering UK lawmaker Jo Cox (0) Oh please, not another gratitude list (0) The News in Brief (0) University police officer shot in head (0) Airstrike hits bridge, disrupting IS supply lines (0) Trump taps Gov.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A      People come from all around the world to see Mount Everest. But if you lived in Nepal and saw it lurking in the distance every day, it might not seem nearly as impressive. You might take it for granted or even dismiss it as no big deal. That’s really where we are today with Apple (AAPL) and the absolutely gargantuan Apple cash hoard. It’s been so large for so long that no one really pays attention to it anymore. In fact, it seems the most common thing I hear said about the Apple cash stockpile these days is that “it’s really not that big when you take debt and potential taxes into consideration.” Frankly, that’s ridiculous. Even allowing for a massive tax haircut, AAPL’s cash hoard would rank as one of history largest treasures… a fortune that would make Croesus blush. As of Apple’s latest quarterly earnings report, the company had $231.5 billion in cash and marketable securities. The Apple cash balance — the gross number, before any debt or tax considerations — would be the 13th-largest company in the world… bigger than Wal-Mart (WMT) and just a hair smaller than Procter & Gamble (PG). Now, of course, the Apple cash is mostly overseas, while Apple’s $72.4 billion in debt is mostly domestic. Let’s pretend that Apple suddenly got religion and decided it wanted to be debt free… now. And let’s further assume that Apple wanted to move its entire cash hoard stateside because… go America! And let’s take this one step further and assume that Apple is paying the full 35% U.S. corporate tax rate on the whole pile of money. (None of these are realistic assumptions, mind you, but let’s go through the exercise anyway…) After taxes, Apple’s $231.5 billion in cash becomes $150.5 billion. That would still put the Apple cash hoard in the top 30 largest companies in the S&P 500… about on par with Phillip Morris International (PM) and just a hair smaller than IBM (IBM), Disney (DIS) and Pepsico (PEP). After stripping out the $72.4 billion in debt, the $150.5 billion becomes $78.1 billion. That’s still not exactly chump change. In fact, that’s nearly double the average market cap of all S&P 500 and more than four times bigger than the median market cap of all S&P 500 companies. And remember, this all assumes the absolute worst case scenario for taxes. Were Apple to actually attempt to repatriate its cash, it would likely negotiate much better terms. So, yes. The Apple cash hoard is a big deal, no matter how you slice it.

RInfra had announced its plan to monetise cement, roads and Mumbai power businesses to reduce the overall debt.

Blog :  Female Tech Exec from India Shares ‘Reality’ of Silicon Valley Article :  Gain More Control of BYOD Apps with an Enterprise App Store HP Inc: Surprisingly Good Financial Results That Shouldn’t Have Been Surprising Rob Enderle |   Unfiltered Opinion   |   Posted 24 Aug, 2016          |         |     Share HP Inc., the version of HP that sells personal computers, tablets and printers, reported strong results this quarter, but behind these results are three key elements. First, the firm has a relatively stable and experienced executive team. Second, it is very focused on a limited number of segments. And third, it appears to be out-marketing every other firm in its segment. Oh, and it has one huge potential killer product in its 3D printer, which is now shipping to key customers like Rolls Royce. Cars in this class have a high percentage of very unique parts, making them an ideal candidate for a production level 3D printer like HP Inc.’s. Let’s talk about the pillars that support HP Inc.’s strong financial results. Stable/Loyal/Experienced Executive Team From the standpoint of staffing, when HP split into two parts, HPE and HP Inc., it was clear that HP Inc. made out like a bandit in executive staff. Each of the top executives had decades of experience in the industry. In two critical areas, Finance and HR, these people represented some of the best in the industry. Even the CEO, while new to the position, was deeply experienced with personal computers and came to the job very highly regarded. This creates a foundation of stability and excellence that bleeds down through the organization. Until recently, most of the HP folks I know who left the firm would never even consider going back. There has been a wave of returning HP folks to HP Inc. and they talk about the company as if it were young, vibrant and very different from the HP they left. Successful companies are often defined by stability, loyalty and experience. This foundational concept was showcased in the financials this week. Focused Strategy for HP Inc. A lot of technology companies are suffering as they attempt to pivot to new industries and opportunities while trying to maintain the revenue streams that pay the bills. HP Inc. doesn’t really have this problem at the moment. PCs and Printers was and remains a relatively focused market, and while both segments appear to be in decline, the theoretical causes of the PC decline, tablets and smartphones, are themselves in trouble. Printing is in decline, but the rate is very slow and people don’t like change so they are holding on to printing for some things. And HP continues to innovate here so its supply numbers, while weakening, remain surprisingly strong. Their printing pivot to 3D printing is now rolling into production and, unlike most composite 3D printers, which turn out prototypes that can’t be used in production, HP Inc.’s printed parts are in many cases usable in final products. This is likely why companies like Rolls Royce are using them. This one line has massive upside potential and while the printers are just ramping out of test runs to production runs, they could be a powerful foundation for growth come 2017. Marketing at HP Inc. Marketing is one of those things that makes me wonder how many tech CEOs actually attended business school, or paid attention to the marketing classes while there. Currently, a good chunk of the cause of the technology downturn is a distinct lack of demand generation for the related products. HP Inc. is the counterpoint to this, as it appears to be outspending and out-executing every other company in its segment, and this likely also speaks to why its results were so strong. What makes HP so unique is that a number of key players have marketing backgrounds that are surprisingly broad. Antonio J. Lucio traces back through PepsiCo and Procter & Gamble, which is surprisingly deep for a tech CMO. Ron Coughlin, who heads Personal Systems, was the CMO for Pepsi and has degrees in marketing. This likely explains why the firm is out-executing its peers in terms of demand; it not only has one of the strongest CMOs from the standpoint of experience, but the guy running Personal Systems has a very similar background and he controls a good chunk of the marketing budget. Having experience and understanding for marketing in operational roles is something we haven’t really seen since Steve Jobs’ death, and HP Inc.’s results showcase why this is important. Wrapping Up: Foundations of Success at HP Inc. There is a foundation for success in a company. It starts with a stable, loyal qualified executive team, followed by a lack of complexity in the business model and the requisite focus. Finally, the company needs adequate marketing skills and resources so that the team not only knows what to do, but can afford to do it. This is all highlighted in HP Inc.’s financial results. I should add that I watch two people closely who represent the best of what they do: Cathie Lesjak, the CFO, who was known at HP for pretty much being right every time; and Tracy Keogh, the most experienced HR manager I’ve met since the 1970s or when HR was last treated as a true profession, not just a compliance organization. In the end, HP Inc. is the part of HP I’m no longer worried about, for good reason.

Off the Street Video Research Politics World Science Policy Tech Energy Religion Defense Sports Recent Videos Advertisement: August 25, 2016 Treasury's Regulatory Overstep Attempts to Fix the Wrong ProblemBy William Shughart When Washington intervenes in the economy to "fix" a perceived problem, more often than not it ends up causing more confusion and doing more harm than good. Take the Treasury Department's sweeping new "earnings-stripping" regulations designed to stop so-called inversions, a rational business strategy allowing U.S.-based companies to recover some of the competitive advantages they have lost because America imposes the highest combined federal, state and local corporate tax rates on the planet (among OECD countries, only France comes close). By merging with a foreign corporation and moving its headquarters to another country with a lower tax rate, U.S. companies can raise their after-tax earnings, thus supplying the wherewithal for more investment, expanded production and additional hiring. Calling inversions unpatriotic and contributing to capital "flight" - sending investment and jobs overseas - the U.S. Treasury has been pushing new regulations in recent months to make it more difficult for businesses to avoid paying their "fair" share of the taxes flowing into governmental coffers. Previously announced "reforms" did little to stop businesses from pulling up stakes here at home and moving to friendlier tax environments, so Treasury buckled down in April and proposed new regulations under Section 385 of the Internal Revenue Code. Those regulations would empower the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to classify how related-party interests in a corporation can be treated as income rather than debt. The significance? Bigger corporate tax bills. Despite being rolled out with some fanfare - including a host of laudatory comments from President Obama - financial institutions, business groups, accounting firms and both parties on Capitol Hill have been unimpressed, arguing that the new regulations go too far, overturn long-standing tax case law and upend foundational tax principles. As a result, businesses not even contemplating inversions will find themselves paying higher taxes for simply managing inter-company debt transactions. News flash: businesses do not pay income taxes, only people (owners, employees, suppliers and customers) do. The corporate tax burden is shifted backward and forward in various ways depending on the nature of the industry in which the company operates. Moreover, corporate income is taxed twice: once at the level of the firm and then again at the level of individual shareholders when distributed to them as dividends. Any increases in the market value of the corporation (capital gains) are taxed when investors sell their shares. Recognizing these other taxes on corporate incomes, a principled argument can be made that the "optimal" corporate income tax rate is zero. Even if one is not willing to go that far, extensive analysis conducted by Ernst and Young concluded that, "The proposed regulations reach well beyond the inversion transactions that may have been their primary impetus; they extend to routine financing transactions for both non-US-based and US-based multinational corporations, for some majority-owned subsidiaries, for private equity funds and their portfolio companies, and for taxable real estate investment trust subsidiaries." In addition, "if finalized in their current form, the proposed regulations would dramatically affect a wide range of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) transactions and ordinary course [of business] corporate finance and tax operations." Alarmingly, some companies, such as Procter & Gamble, estimate that compliance with the new regulations would raise their annual operating costs by between $220 and $340 million. Earnings that otherwise would go to hiring new employees, investing in research and development or inventing new products and services instead will by sucked up by the federal government. After a three-month public comment period during which myriad commentators - individual taxpayers, large and small businesses, economists, accountants and former government officials - weighed in on the changes, a senior Treasury official was forced to concede that the proposal was a "blunt instrument [that] might have overdone it." The problem isn't inversions, it's our overly complex, anti-growth, anti-investment corporate tax code. And the simplest and most effective way of fixing the problem is bringing U.S. corporate tax rates more in line with our global competitors. Do that and inversions will stop without resorting to more regulations and hiring more IRS agents to enforce them.   William F. Shughart II, research director of the Independent Institute, is J.

Apple will purchase the electricity generated by the plant to power its stores in California. Credit Andrew Burton for The New York Times PALO ALTO, Calif. — The words are stenciled on the front of the Apple Store, a glass box sandwiched between a nondescript Thai restaurant and a CVS pharmacy in downtown Palo Alto: “This store runs on 100 percent renewable energy.” If Apple’s plans play out, it will be able to make that claim not only for its operations throughout California but also beyond, as the company aims to meet its growing needs for electricity with green sources like solar, wind and hydroelectric power. Like other big companies before it, including Walmart and Google, Apple recently received a federal designation for its energy subsidiary that allows it to become a wholesale seller of electricity from coast to coast. In effect, Apple is creating its own green utility company, although the main customer is itself. The motives may be economic as much as they are environmental. As a wholesaler, Apple could reduce the cost of its electricity load, which reached 831 million kilowatt-hours in the last fiscal year — enough to power about 76,000 homes for a year. But like a growing number of corporations, Apple is intent on reducing carbon dioxide emissions from electricity production — one of the biggest sources of greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming. Continue reading the main story Advertisement Continue reading the main story In one ambitious venture, Apple has contracted with First Solar to begin buying a little less than half of the power later this year from California Flats, a solar energy farm now under construction. Under the terms of the deal, Apple will pay $848 million for the electricity over 25 years and receive the farm’s total output by the end of the agreement. It is one of largest commercial clean energy contracts yet. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Lisa Jackson, the former administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency who is now the Apple executive overseeing environmental policy, social initiatives and worldwide government affairs, said she hoped Apple could serve as a model for the many other big corporate power users that are now embracing clean energy. “This is just another sort of innovative way to get that power onto the grid so we don’t have to take the California grid-mix default, which still includes fossil fuel,” Ms. Jackson said. Although much of Apple’s manufacturing is done offshore, it still has extensive needs for electric power in the United States — and not only for the sprawling new corporate campus it is building at its headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., and its 270 retail stores around the country. One of Apple’s biggest demands for electricity comes from operating the computing cloud through which it sells apps, music and videos to users of its iPhones, iPads and Mac computers. Apple’s move comes as prices for renewable energy continue to plummet. And signing long-term contracts allows businesses to shield themselves from potentially higher, more volatile charges from a power company. Apple would not say how much it was paying for California Flats’s energy, but Ms. Jackson said last year at a Wall Street Journal conference that it was less than what it paid for commercial power. She said she expected the company to save hundreds of millions of dollars over the life of the contract. Google, which received its federal energy wholesale designation from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in 2010, is a big proponent of the approach Apple is now taking. “Running any kind of business, having predictability in terms of your operating costs can be very important,” said Gary Demasi, director of operations for data center energy and location strategy at Google, which has been a leading investor in and user of clean energy. “Renewable energy, from a cost perspective, is now competitive with other forms of energy, much more so than it was a few years ago.” In the United States, the generating capacity of corporate clean energy projects has more than doubled each year since 2013, according to the Business Renewables Center at the Rocky Mountain Institute, which tracks publicly announced deals. In 2015, 11 companies signed up for 3.23 gigawatts’ worth of projects, roughly the equivalent of five coal plants and up from 1.18 gigawatts the year before. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Executives face greater pressure from shareholders and customers to show that they are doing their part to fight climate change. At the same time, corporate energy use has exploded, driven in many cases by the ravenous demands of the data cloud. “We are all becoming very large energy players, and this is a shift,” said Brian Janous, director of energy strategy at Microsoft. “Energy is not something that Microsoft or Amazon or Google really ever had to think much about prior to the advent of the cloud.” Photo Newly installed rotator hinges at the First Solar plant will allow the panels to rotate with the sun. Credit Andrew Burton for The New York Times Helping drive that shift are environmental groups like the World Resources Institute. In May, it helped create the Renewable Energy Buyers Alliance, a coalition of nonprofits that has more than 60 corporations in its network, including McDonald’s and General Motors, as well as Google and Walmart Journalism that matters. More essential than ever. Subscribe to the Times Electric utilities have begun to respond by creating products and services to meet the corporate demand for clean energy, said Letha Tawney, the World Resources Institute’s director of utility innovation. One such product is a green tariff. It was pioneered in North Carolina by Duke Energy and is now under consideration in about a dozen states. It allows companies to designate that they are paying for a renewable energy supply. Another is a synthetic or virtual power purchase agreement, under which companies contract to buy the output of a clean power plant, as Apple is doing with California Flats. Although the companies say these arrangements mean they are running their businesses on renewable energy, in reality the clean power often does not flow directly to their facilities. They typically buy the renewable energy in amounts to match what they draw from the grid — a system of swaps that Ms. Jackson of Apple likened to using an A.T.M. “The dollar you deposit in the bank might not be the exact same bill that you get out,” she said. Robert F. Shapiro, a partner at the law firm Chadbourne & Parke who focuses on project finance and energy, describes it as meaningful symbolism. Advertisement Continue reading the main story “They’re actually getting power from their local utility, which may be coal,” Mr. Shapiro said. “But they’re deemed to have put into the world carbon-neutral energy, which they are deemed to have used for their load.” To keep track of the clean energy credits, power generators work with registries to issue numbered certificates. “The power flows into the grid. The electrons go where they go,” Ms. Tawney said. “But because there’s a renewable-energy certificate, no one else can claim the same zero-carbon benefit.” Such complexities are necessary, executives and clean energy advocates say, because it is not often feasible to install enough renewable-power generators at corporate sites to meet companies’ full energy needs. Walmart, despite having installed solar panels, wind turbines and fuel cells at stores and distribution centers, can nonetheless meet only about a third of those operations’ energy needs. So it also buys renewable energy from generators and utilities, said David Ozment, director of energy at Walmart stores. Procter & Gamble, another member of the energy buyers’ alliance, has arranged to purchase all of the steam from a biomass generator under construction at a plant in Georgia where it makes Charmin toilet paper and Bounty paper towels, said Jack McAneny, the company’s director of sustainability. But that was possible, he said, only because of the plant’s location near a source of waste wood and pulp for fuel and the cooperation of P&G’s partners. Among those partners are the local utility, Georgia Power, which will buy the electricity from the generator for its customers from Constellation, the company that developed and will own and operate the generator. At Apple, where the purchase or production of renewable energy has more than tripled since 2012, the company would prefer to not have to go to great lengths to ensure a clean energy supply, Ms. Jackson said. But the public energy grid is simply still too dependent on carbon-based fuels to make that possible. “If we had our preference, we’d just be able to say, ‘We want 100 percent green power everywhere we use power,’” Ms. Jackson said. “The best would be if we could run every one of our stores, every one of our data centers, every office complex, every building we have, on 100 percent renewable — and if we didn’t have to spend a whole bunch of our time and energy figuring out how to get that done.” A version of this article appears in print on August 24, 2016, on page B1 of the New York edition with the headline: Creating Their Own Green Sources.

SCA is Europe's biggest private owner of forests. Its hygiene business is the world's largest maker of incontinence pads and No.2 in consumer tissues such as napkins and toilet paper. Its forestry arm produces paper, pulp and wood products. "This is what everybody has been waiting for," said Evli Bank analyst Markku Jarvinen. "The businesses are clearly very different from an investment standpoint. The forest business is low return on capital, very stable, and the hygiene business is high return on capital." SCA shares jumped as much as 13 percent to a new high of 281.90 crowns, giving it a market value of about $23 billion. SCA said in August last year it would merge its forest land and forest products businesses into one division, leading many analysts then to expect a split-up of the group. The company said on Wednesday a separate listing for its hygiene arm, whose brands include Libero, Libresse, Nosotras, Saba and TENA, would "create more shareholder value and incur relatively low transactional risk and relatively low transaction costs", compared with alternative ways of splitting the group. Shares in forestry firm Holmen, which analysts have identified as a potential buyer or partner for SCA's forest products business, rose 6 percent. Holmen is controlled by Fredrik Lundberg, the Swedish business magnate who is also chairman of SCA's biggest shareholder, Swedish investment firm Industrivarden. Industrivarden and SCA's No.2 shareholder, Norway's sovereign wealth fund, said they backed the planned separation, which will be voted on at SCA's 2017 annual general meeting. They control 29.8 and 8.7 percent of votes respectively. Betting on strong long-term growth for hygiene products, SCA has in recent years expanded this business to account for about 85 percent of sales and cut back its paper and other wood products businesses. The company said on Wednesday a break-up would leave it better placed to succeed in both business areas. SCA, which was founded in 1929 and competes with Procter & Gamble and Kimberly-Clark, said it planned to list the hygiene business in the second half of 2017 under a new name. The company makes the bulk of its sales in Europe, where it expects an ageing population to boost demand for incontinence products. It is also expanding in emerging markets, expecting rising incomes there to lift demand for hygiene products. SCA was thrust into the spotlight in 2014 when Swedish media uncovered a corporate spending scandal that prompted the CEO to resign and led to a change of guard at Industrivarden.

Minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) July meeting showed officials were split on whether an increase in interest rate was needed soon. In Europe, the latest data showed that Germany's economy slowed in the second quarter, as investment dropped after a strong start to the year. Germany's gross domestic product grew at a quarterly rate of 0.4%, or an annualized rate of 1.7%, according to the Federal Statistical Office, Destatis. The economy expanded at a quarterly clip of 0.7% in the first quarter. Closer home, the market breadth indicating the overall health of the market was strong.

Indian Oil Corporation surged 3.89% to Rs 564.15 after the company said that its board of directors will consider issue of bonus shares along with Q1 June 2016 results on 29 August 2016. The announcement was made during market hours today, 24 August 2016. Welspun India was locked at 10% lower circuit at Rs 59.30 on reports that Wal-Mart Stores Inc. is reviewing the company's cotton certification records following Target Corp.'s decision to snap ties with the Indian textile maker over a cotton supply dispute. Walmart is Welspun's third-largest customer, behind Target. Target Corporation, one of Welspun's biggest clients, severed business ties with it earlier this week on charges that Welspun used cheaper quality cotton while supplying bed sheets between August 2014 and July 2016 without Target having any knowledge of this substitution. Target had pulled sheets and pillowcases off its shelves after discovering they were mislabeled as Egyptian cotton after a probe was initiated by it. Shares of Welspun India had hit 20% lower circuit in last two sessions following Target's announcement on Friday, 19 August 2016 of snapping ties with the company after violation of Target's code of conduct and standards of vendor engagement. Reports also suggest that US apparel and home furnishings retailer J. C. Penney Company, Inc. is investigating Welspun's products in the wake of the issue.

The Business Times Print Singapore's move to build a pipeline of global-ready talent and corporate leaders is picking up pace. On Tuesday, NTUC and the Economic Development Board tied up for the first time to launch a programme to provide promising young executives international exposure. Separately, trade promotion agency International Enterprise Singapore also said that it has awarded 13 scholarships to groom the next generation of talent to take on an international portfolio. The tie-up programme between the labour movement and the investment promotion body, the U Future Leaders Global Programme, "aims to identify young and promising Singaporeans from participating organisations, provide them with international exposure and opportunities to build key leadership attributes and develop relevant competencies" that could move them up the corporate ladder fast. It also aims to get more MNCs to groom aspiring Singaporeans to helm future leadership roles. NTUC said in a press release that the programme is open to companies which are part of its U Circle of Friends. Six MNCs which have made Singapore their regional headquarters are in the pilot programme. They are Dentsu Aegis Network, Diageo, Mastercard Asia Pacific, Procter & Gamble, Unilever and Yum! Asia Franchise. The need to encourage Singapore talent to gain overseas experience was pushed for in a Future Leaders Summit last year by NTUC chief Chan Chun Sing. This has been underscored in a study by Linkedln and NTUC, which found more than half of the corporate executives covered in the study have worked or studied abroad. The IE scholarships were given under its Young Talent (YTP) and Undergraduate Scholarship programmes - eight for the YTP and five for the undergraduate programme. The YTP was launched in 2013 and has 16 industry partners, with six which just came on board. This article was first published on Aug 24, 2016. Get The Business Times for more stories.

SCA is Europe's biggest private owner of forests. Its hygiene business is the world's largest maker of incontinence pads and No.2 in consumer tissues such as napkins and toilet paper. Its forestry arm produces paper, pulp and wood products. "This is what everybody has been waiting for," said Evli Bank analyst Markku Jarvinen. "The businesses are clearly very different from an investment standpoint. The forest business is low return on capital, very stable, and the hygiene business is high return on capital." SCA shares jumped as much as 13 percent to a new high of 281.90 crowns, giving it a market value of about $23 billion. SCA said in August last year it would merge its forest land and forest products businesses into one division, leading many analysts then to expect a split-up of the group. The company said on Wednesday a separate listing for its hygiene arm, whose brands include Libero, Libresse, Nosotras, Saba and TENA, would "create more shareholder value and incur relatively low transactional risk and relatively low transaction costs", compared with alternative ways of splitting the group. Shares in forestry firm Holmen, which analysts have identified as a potential buyer or partner for SCA's forest products business, rose 6 percent. Holmen is controlled by Fredrik Lundberg, the Swedish business magnate who is also chairman of SCA's biggest shareholder, Swedish investment firm Industrivarden (INDUa.ST). Industrivarden and SCA's No.2 shareholder, Norway's sovereign wealth fund, said they backed the planned separation, which will be voted on at SCA's 2017 annual general meeting. They control 29.8 and 8.7 percent of votes respectively. Betting on strong long-term growth for hygiene products, SCA has in recent years expanded this business to account for about 85 percent of sales and cut back its paper and other wood products businesses. The company said on Wednesday a break-up would leave it better placed to succeed in both business areas. SCA, which was founded in 1929 and competes with Procter & Gamble (PG.N) and Kimberly-Clark (KMB.N), said it planned to list the hygiene business in the second half of 2017 under a new name. The company makes the bulk of its sales in Europe, where it expects an ageing population to boost demand for incontinence products. It is also expanding in emerging markets, expecting rising incomes there to lift demand for hygiene products. SCA was thrust into the spotlight in 2014 when Swedish media uncovered a corporate spending scandal that prompted the CEO to resign and led to a change of guard at Industrivarden.

Black Friday Tech Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Holiday Gifts Cyber Monday     DWTS Announces First Star Posted: Aug 23 2016, 7:46pm CDT | by Noel Diem, in News | Latest Celebrity News   Photo Credit: Getty Images   She's continuing a (somewhat) family tradition. According to E! News, Amber Rose will be joining Dancing with the Stars for the upcoming 23rd season. There has been confirmation from multiple sources that the talk show host/model/actress/author/activist is the latest star to sign up for the reality competition and will compete for the Mirrorball Trophy. Don't Miss: Hatchimals Deals on Amazon.com ABC does not comment on casting decisions, whether they are true or not, but the full lineup will come in an announcement on Good Morning American on August 30.  It was previously reported that there are other celebs in talk for this season that run the gamut of the entertainment industry - and sometimes stretch the meaning of the word "star." They include reigning Bachelorette JoJo Fletcher and former Wizards of Waverly Place and The Fosters star Jake T. Austin. There were reports that Olympian Simone Biles would be joining the cast, but she has made it clear that she probably won't be able to do it thanks to her gymnastics obligations and the Kellogg's Tour. "I would love to do Dancing with the Stars, but so far we have a three-month tour after this Olympics," Simone said at the P&G Family Home in Rio. "I'm not sure if I'll have time." However, fans of the gymnast shouldn't give up hope. She thinks that the show will be a great way to wind down after winning four golds and a bronze in the Rio Olympics. "I would really love to do it in the spring if that's possible," she added. Many other gymnasts have competed, including teammate Aly Raisman, Shawn Johnson, who won season eight, and fellow All-Around champion Nastia Liukin. Dancing with the Stars season 23 premieres Monday, Sept. 12 at 8 p.m. on ABC.

We have relationships in this area that we are committed to. We feel it is important for us to return to the area and to assist with recovery in every way we can.” Over 40,000 homes have been affected by the flooding. Approximately 8,000 people remain in shelters and more than 30,000 people have been rescued from flood waters across south Louisiana.

Parameswaran Photo: iStockphoto Erving Goffman was a Canadian-American sociologist and writer, considered “the most influential American sociologist of the twentieth century”. He was also a member of the sociology department at the University of California, Berkeley. He was the first sociologist to study the depiction of genders in advertisements. His book Gender Advertisements, published four decades ago, continues to be a classic on the subject. Collecting over 500 ads during the period 1950 to 1970, the author presented a vivid pictorial analysis of how genders are portrayed in US (and I suppose global) advertising. I had bought a copy of the book through Amazon.com’s used bookseller network at significant cost seven years ago and in a book talk at the Institute of Media Studies in Pune, I was politely reminded that it is now easily available as a PDF. How things have changed! One of the anchor concepts that Goffman speaks about is ‘hyper-ritualization’ of gender stereotypes in print advertisements. Men were portrayed as taller and stronger. Women were always more dainty, smaller, softer. The analysis even pointed out how in most ads the man tends to tower over the women (check this out the next time you are browsing a magazine). The book continues to be relevant and numerous academic studies have followed along that tread the same path. I have also done my bit of analysis of how women are portrayed in Indian packaged goods advertising and presented a paper at an Association for Consumer Research conference in Beijing. As we see more and more stereotypical gender roles portrayed in advertising, we are also seeing new roles being envisaged for husband, wife, brother, sister. I call this phenomenon ‘neo-visualization’. One of the early proponents of this type of advertising was the Airtel ‘woman boss’ ad that was aired two years ago. In that ad, the woman is the boss and the husband is the subordinate who is struggling at office as she calls it a day. She does not visit a spa after work, but heads home to do some innovative cooking. The ad got criticized for presenting the woman in a stereotypical role. What the critics failed to probably notice was that she was enjoying the cooking process—call it the Masterchef effect. If Airtel questioned one set of roles, Procter & Gamble with its Ariel ad is trying to address a bigger problem of gender roles. In the long-format ad that I saw on YouTube (which incidentally is one of the top five most watched video ads in the country), it is the father of the girl who is regretting how he has neglected playing a meaningful role in the running of the household. His wife did the cooking, cleaning, washing, etc., as he went to work and came back to read the newspaper. He regrets that his daughter has been brainwashed to believe that it is her duty to do all that, though she is no longer a homemaker, but is a successful business executive. The old man heads home and asks his wife to teach him how to load the washing machine. A start, he says, hoping that this will get his daughter to start demanding more attention to house work from her husband, and maybe kids. Why should cooking and cleaning be the preserve of women, especially if most of them are now pursuing successful careers? What is the reality in developed markets? In the US, it has been reported that in over 40% of the homes (with a couple living together), cooking is the primary job of the male of the household; 45% of them are in charge of grocery shopping; and over 40% are in charge of dropping the kids to school and picking them up. As I travel the country delivering my book (Nawabs Nudes Noodles, which looks at India through 50 years of advertising) talk, I use the above data to get the men in the audience to do a show of hands on cooking. How many of you men folk here know how to cook? And I have been pleasantly surprised that when it comes to an audience of under 30-year-olds, there is a fair number of hands going up. But if the audience is the 40-plus age cohort, the numbers are very few. You may call it the Masterchef effect, but I would call it a change in the gender role perception in a changing Indian society. Even the humble Prestige pressure cooker, which once tom-tommed its ‘gasket release system’ as the true sign of marital love, is singing a slightly different tune today with the husband (Abhishek Bachchan) cooking for his wife (Aishwarya Rai) with a modern pressure cooker! So it would be interesting to track this changing dialogue in television advertising over the next 10 years and see if, finally, Goffman’s theories get a new twist, from hyper-ritualization to neo-visualization.

Technology has flipped traditional roles, and the younger workers now have a thing or two to teach the veterans. In boardrooms across the nation, "reverse mentoring" is taking root as baby boomer leaders seek out millennials to help them understand the latest in technology, social media and the fast-changing marketplace. "It's not that older generations aren't using technology — of course they're texting and on Facebook," said Debra Arbit, CEO of workplace consultant BridgeWorks. "But the fact that I got my first iPhone when I was a teenager is a very different thing than my mom, who learned how to text when she was 54." Boomer bosses also want to hang on to these younger workers, whose sense of work-life balance and loyalty don't match up with their own. Health care giant UnitedHealth Group sees value in turning the tables. The company, headquartered in suburban Minneapolis, rolled out a reverse mentoring program this summer that paired eight senior executives in its insurance division with eight millennials seen as "emerging leaders." The average age gap is 25 years. "For many of our leaders — outstanding thought leaders in their own right — their connection to the millennial generation is largely through their parenting skills," said Pete Church, vice president of human capital at UnitedHealthcare. "This becomes a fundamentally different kind of experience." UnitedHealth's insurance business is perceived as less innovative than its fast-growing health IT division, Optum. A reverse mentoring program could help executives see the business with fresh eyes but also shape a workplace that reflects the contrasting needs of the next generation. "We're switching roles because we have this business problem we're trying to solve," Church said. The concept of reverse mentoring has been kicking around a handful of Fortune 500 circles for some time, but it has been slow to gain momentum. Credit for bringing the practice to the United States often goes to retired General Electric CEO Jack Welch, who returned from an overseas trip in 1999 and ordered his top leaders to find a junior-level mentor to teach them computer skills. Now there's power in numbers. Millennials recently overtook baby boomers as the largest generation at work, and by 2020 they'll be more than half of the nation's workforce. Companies are taking a renewed interest in reverse mentorship as a business strategy. The Hartford, PwC, Cisco and Procter & Gamble are among the believers. Facebook, along with several nonprofits such as the National 4-H Council, have joined AARP's "Mentor Up" program. At Deloitte — where a reverse mentoring initiative began with young workers teaching older employees how to use email — the benefits flow both ways. "Junior professionals" gain more exposure to top leaders and build confidence, said Minneapolis managing partner Jeff Cotton. Baby boomers rose in the ranks of a hierarchical workplace, where they were told what to do. Millennials have been shaped by social networks, where everyone is on equal footing — they've been able to tweet the president since they were 12. They're comfortable giving advice, having been raised by boomer parents who consulted them on everything from how to set up the Wii console to what to eat for dinner and where to go on vacation, said BridgeWorks' Arbit, whose company helps businesses manage the generational divide. "Millennials have always been counselors at home," Arbit said. "And then they get to the workplace and they're never asked their opinion? It's such an immediate way to disengage this generation." It seemed to make a difference for Amanda Daeges, an attorney at U.S. Bank in Minneapolis. A few years ago, Daeges was tapped to join a group of millennials inside the bank known as the "Dynamic Dozen." Launched in 2009, the initiative draws workers in their 20s and 30s from across the company to tackle a yearlong project of their choosing aimed at serving millennial customers and younger employees. The project culminates with a formal presentation in the executive boardroom and a private lunch with U.S. Bank CEO Richard Davis. Was it stressful? "Of course!" said Daeges, now 37 and a vice president in the Minneapolis-based bank's legal department. "But they were very interested, and I felt like our opinion was valued and considered by them. When we finished our presentation, one senior leader said, 'That's so simple. Why aren't we doing this?' And we were just trying to contain the grins on our faces." - Jackie Crosby, Minneapolis Star Tribune, (c) 2016 Tribune News Service Most Read Find Local Real Estate Jobs Autos Businesses Find a job Buy or sell a car Find a place to live See what's for sale Find a business View obituaries Business Names in the News Does your company have a recent hire, promotion, appointment or honoree to announce?

No company has a more interesting, unique, funny marketing campaign than Old Spice, and there’s not a more interesting, unique, funny athlete in professional sports than Von Miller. It’s the perfect union. “Between winning the Super Bowl, solidifying my status with the Broncos and being named the newest Old Spice guy, 2016 is shaping up to be quite a year,” Miller said. “I’ve had my favorite Old Spice scents for a long time and I only trust the Hardest Working Collection to give me a deep clean after practices and keep me smelling fresh on and off the field. There’s a reason you find Old Spice in every team’s locker room.” Image courtesy of Old Spice Over the last few years, Terry Crews has been fantastic in his role as “Old Spice Guy,” but now it’s Von Miller’s turn, and Old Spice could not be more excited. “We’re excited to welcome Von, one of the NFL’s top-performing players and unique personalities, to the Old Spice family,” Janine Miletic, Old Spice Brand Director at Procter & Gamble, said. “Von’s engaging, humorous demeanor and hardworking on-field performance align perfectly with our ridiculously masculine brand and the performance of our Hardest Working Collection combining our most popular scents with our most powerful sweat and odor protection and deep cleansing body washes.” The new Old Spice commercials will begin running during the 2016 season, so make sure you keep an eye out for Von Miller!

(Reuters/Rupak De Chowdhuri) Share Written by Suneera Tandon August 23, 2016 Quartz india In a country of roadside barber shops and ubiquitous Gillette razors, a former McKinsey associate has traveled all the way to China and back to give Indian men a classy shave. Bombay Shaving Company started in August 2015 by Shantanu Deshpande (28), wants to sell razors, shaving gels and balms online in India’s Rs7,500-crore male grooming market. His competition includes multinational and homegrown behemoths such as Gillette, Emami, and Godrej Consumer Products. It’s a tall order. But Deshpande, who spent some four years working with the country’s leading consumer goods companies in his consulting days, is convinced that more and more Indian men want to look good, and few brands are helping them do so. “They are on Tinder and matrimonial websites, and they are taking more selfies than ever and they need to look well groomed,” he explained. So the Bombay Shaving Company has floated a nifty shaving kit that is exclusively sold online and currently costs about Rs3,000. It includes a shaving cream, pre-shave scrub, balm, blades—which should together last around 60-75 shaves—and a razor and brush. The latter two are being pitched as a one-time buy. That’s not a cheap upfront cost when compared to Gillette’s razor, which is priced anywhere between Rs22 and Rs500 or more, plus the additional cost of blades. Nonetheless, since it first began selling in July 2016, the company has picked up 1,350 subscribers online. In the next six months, Deshpande hopes to add 25,000 subscribers. They’ve also managed to line up a group of investors. Last August, just after Deshpande quit McKinsey, two dozen individual investors backed him with seed funding of Rs4 crore. Shaving off the monopoly For years, Indian men were mostly ignored by consumer goods companies. Those days seem to be over. In fact, male-grooming is one of the fastest-growing consumer segments in India, Nielsen said in a research report in April 2015. The big drivers are the emergence of men’s fairness creams, sunscreens, and beer shampoos by companies such as L’oreal, Emami, and Marico. The boom isn’t simply because Indian men want to appeal to the opposite sex. “Good grooming, they (Indian men) believe, is conducive to boosting self-confidence,” Nielsen suggests. Amid this boom, the Bombay Shaving Company is looking to close the gap between cheap brands and high-end products, especially for consumers in urban markets who are willing to pay more. “Yes, it is a premium brand,” said Deshpande, adding that his target consumer is the “discerning Indian male, who has an inclination for doing things right or being mindful in all his activities.” Except there’s one problem: Gillette, owned by American multinational Proctor & Gamble, controls majority of the Indian shaving market. “That’s a huge, huge monopoly by one brand. We can enter the shaving market and be a second or third best,” said Deshpande. The right razor The idea of men’s online grooming brand isn’t entirely new. With more men around the globe spending more time and money on looking better, new-age brands have emerged. Take, for instance, the Dollar Shave Club in the US, started in 2011, which was recently bought over by Unilever for $1 billion. In 2015, the American company clocked a turnover of $150 million selling low-priced razors as an alternative to Gillette and Schick. In India, however, building a similar male-grooming company isn’t easy. One of the biggest challenges that Deshpande faced was finding the right razor. Gillette manufacturers most of the razors that it sells in India. So, Deshpande spent eight months looking for the right option to manufacture the razor—designed by the team in-house, which he chanced upon in Guangzhou, China, after posting a query on Chinese e-commerce website Alibaba. In a segment dominated by mass-market products, “niche brands or products like these can become popular but it is not to say that they will replace or become very dominant in the market,” reckoned Ankur Bisen, vice-president, retail and consumer products, at consulting firm Technopak Advisors. “So they will have a restrictive model or consumer base at last as they start out, but there is a market for consumers who are well-traveled and understand global trends who are willing to experiment,” added Bisen. Deshpande understands the importance of being more accessible. “We will go down the value chain, not just yet. We want to build aspiration around the brand,” he said. Bombay Shaving Company eventually plans to convert online sales into a large off-line business. Deshpande, who is ready for a series A, to secure a larger tranche of funding post the seed capital, seems prepared for a long battle with the big consumer goods companies. All this for a well-groomed man. Read full story home our picks popular latest obsessions search

Economy Watch Why some dreams never get delivered? By Webmaster - August 23, 2016 0 224 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Saad Amanullah Khan I have set a daunting vision and targets, but no one is excited and committed in delivering them, what do I do?” said an entrepreneur leading a small business in Lahore, Pakistan. How many times have we heard this desperate message coming from people who are passionately driven by a vision, a dream, or an innovative hypothesis? Their inability to convert their ideas into a workable product or service and their helplessness to commercialize and monetize its benefits, is extremely frustrating and debilitating. If we assume for a minute that the visionary has confirmed the following: a) the product or service idea they have envisioned is viable; b) the concept has been tested via field surveys, personal interviews and focus groups and holds water; and c) strategies have been identified and are sound and based on market data and experiences. Then the question that begs to be answered is “Why do so many business start-ups fail?” The primary reason for such business plans to fail is because ‘organization excellence’ is missing in that team or from that entire firm. What many people miss out is that delivering a vision is not all about envisioning and selecting the right strategies and tactics. Factors such as human interaction, level of trust within the organization, tone at the top, inherent business savvy culture, value systems and other organizational aspects are equally important to help deliver a vision. Always remember that a vision in isolation has no value and no likelihood of turning into reality if it is not supported by a strong conducive culture nurtured by committed and dedicated leaders. I have realized over time that in majority of cases where leaders have failed to step change the business, the reasons had more to do with ignoring the “smell of the place” rather than lack of robust strategies and plans. What is organizational excellence? Organizational excellence takes root when the culture of an organization displays high level of discipline, trust, collaboration and behaviour that is value driven. As Jim Collins says very eloquently in his book “Good to Great”, that in order to move from being a good company to a great company, one of the requirements is to have a culture of discipline. Try to hire and fill the organziation with self-disciplined people who are willing to go to extreme lengths in order to fulfill their responsibilities. A disciplined culture is one that is rigorous, not ruthless, with rigor starting at the top. Discipline is necessary in everything that is happening within a company, whether it is in delivering strategies or in managing subordinates, in organizing meetings or interacting with customers, it is totally holistic. To me an ideal culture will have trust in abundance at every level of the organization and in every team and in every relationship. Each employee’s DNA willbe programmed to deliver excellence and peak performance in whatever they do. This kind of culture cannot be created overnight and has to be nurtured, protected and developed over years. Leadership has to be consistent and disciplined in their approach so that over time you can drive this into the character and DNA of each and every employee just like what Darwin meant when he coined the concept of “natural selection”; that is over time only the best and those who believe in that company’s philosophy of excellence will survive. And once that has been achieved, then the sky is the limit as no person or competition can stand in the way of such an organization. Three concepts are vital when it comes to an organization’s ability to drive excellence. They are building trust, moving out of your comfort zone, and inculcating stretch mentality. Lets take one at a time: Building Trust: Presence of trust within an organization and between the organization and its partners, suppliers, distributors, etc. is the foundation on which sustainable success is built. In my 30 odd years with P&G and Gillette, trust was one thing that stood the test of time and never wavered. Productivity and commitment of employees grows many folds if there is trust between them and their bosses, between the company and its consumers and customers. Remember that trust is a very valuable commodity and does not come easily. It takes years and even decades to build but can be destroyed in a matter of seconds. But once it is entrenched in a company’s culture and daily interaction that its probability of success surges considerably. If you are a business owner, do ask yourself the following question: “What is the level of trust in my company between the various stakeholder?” Whatever level you find, work towards enhancing trust because every notch that you enhance trust, it positively impacts success of your business. Remember you may have the best insights and strategies to drive business growth, but lack of trust in the organization has a funny way of short-circuiting your business efforts Moving out of your Comfort Zone: Comfort zone is a psychological state where a person, a team or an organization are in a comfortable, risk-free and relaxed state. When someone is in the comfort zone, they only do activities that they are comfortable with. They do not push themselves, their mind, their bodies or their spirits to discover or test new concepts that they are unsure or uncertain about. By staying in this zone they lose out on numerous opportunities that come knocking on their door. To succeed in your business and even in life in general, you must walk out of your comfort zone. If you want to achieve something interesting or memorable in life you must take risks, you must test new ideas and for that you have to leave your comfort zone. Same fact is true in case of a leader, if he does not challenge his and his teams comfort zone that business will never be able to grasp new opportunities and capitalize on new prospects. Inculcating Stretch Mentality: Stretch mentality was popularized by General Electric Corporation (GE) when they referred to their business plans as stretch goals. Stretch goals refer to business goals that are not yet possible but in order to achieve them the team has to think hard, they have to think innovatively and holistically. By setting stretch goals you make them walk out of their comfort zone and indirectly force them to come up with better and improved solutions to their challenges. In my career at P&G and later at Gillette, I have used stretch goals to inspire and drive behavior where my teams literally delivered audacious goals on several occasions. This was made possible by creating the right atmosphere such as encouraging a ‘can do’ attitude and positive thinking. I saw fresh ideas and radical thinking emerging and a definite shift in the organization’s culture towards willingly handling difficult challenges. The critical point to note when driving organizational excellence is that management plays a critical role by their actions, their attitude and their visible leadership. The culture at the end is an accumulation of the entire employee behaviors that ultimately brings together a distinct positive culture to life.

Grey had been AOR on DirecTV, which is now part of the larger telecomms organization — and according to Kantar Media, the client spent at least $2 billion in measured media last year. An agency spokesperson writes, “Grey New York has had a staff reduction of a little over 1% primarily due to the AT&T/DirecTV move.  We’ve also had to rebalance our staff due to changes in our clients’ marketing priorities/spending on some accounts across departments.  These are very difficult decisions and we wanted to give people notice, provide severance and begin the process of seeing if there are job opportunities available at other WPP companies.” The Grey rep declined to elaborate further or name individuals who have left, but our sources claim that much of the DirecTV creative and production teams, along with several account executives, are no longer with the WPP shop. The 1 percent number would put the total affected in the low double digits. While DirecTV was a significant loss, Grey has also recorded several new business wins and account expansions in recent months including GSK, Marriott, Weber, Kellogg’s, Best Buy and P&G’s shaving brands. Grey London is currently hiring as well after winning retail giant Marks & Spencer. We know because one of our contacts is applying to work there, but don’t ask about starting salaries for junior copywriters. < Previous Article Next Article > Advertisement Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

Storytelling Empowers Veterans: The Ariel Group Announces Partnership with The Homefront Foundation, Inc. Posted on August 24, 2016 by Top News US Full Feed in Press Releases Conceptual image of a businessman holding big hammer The Ariel Group, a portfolio company of Renovus Capital Partners, said Monday that it has partnered with The Homefront Foundation, Inc. The Homefront Foundation helps veterans, service members, and first responders use storytelling techniques to reconnect and integrate back into their communities. Boston, MA (PRWEB) August 24, 2016 The Ariel Group LLC, a registered B Corporation and communication skills training company based in Lexington, Massachusetts, has partnered with The Homefront Foundation, a Tampa, Florida-based non-profit organization that helps veterans, service members, and first responders through storytelling. “The Ariel Group is delighted to collaborate with The Homefront Foundation on this important work,” says Sean Kavanagh, Ariel’s CEO. “We teach storytelling in corporate and higher education settings around the world and we were very pleased to meet Matt Fetterman in our program at Columbia and now be invited to see the power of stories for our returning veterans. We look forward to continued collaboration and to supporting the healing and connecting power of stories for the men and women who serve.” Founded in 2016 by Matt and Mark Fetterman, twin brothers who both served in the Navy, The Homefront Foundation helps veterans rehabilitate to life – both personally and professionally – through the power of storytelling. “As veterans return home from a deployment, a sleepless shift at the station or a disaster response effort, people expect them to seamlessly reintegrate into their work, their communities, and their families,” explains Matt Fetterman. “The stressors and challenges faced in doing this are what many will never fully understand. It is only through sharing and storytelling that we can begin to learn these lessons and discover more of who wears the uniform, carries the shield or serves on that front line. The mission of The Homefront Foundation aligns perfectly with Ariel’s interactive, theater-based approach to create a unique, much-needed service to these great men and women and those they serve.” Since its founding, The Ariel Group has worked with organizations that service communities for the greater good. Hoping to impact the non-profit world as strongly as the corporate world, The Ariel Group focuses outreach efforts on professions and agencies that rely on their communication skills to affect positive change on a fundamental, humane level. Other recent partnerships include The Acumen Fund, The United Nations and The Social Innovation Forum. “Our training creates the space for our veterans to tell the stories that are stitched into the fabric of who they are, and in doing so, there is a gained understanding of that specific piece of them that up until this point was most likely hidden,” says Meghan Zbikowski, Outreach Manager of The Ariel Group. “Providing this training and hearing these stories of those who serve our country is an absolute privilege. We look forward to the continued development our partnership with The Homefront Foundation and more importantly the profound value this work will bring to our veterans, their families and community.” About The Ariel Group Using best practices from actor training and adult learning, The Ariel Group helps business people make impactful interpersonal connections through emotional intelligence, self-awareness and dynamic communication skills. Our mission is to teach individuals at every level to communicate effectively and build empathetic relationships with each other, to help their organizations experience higher engagement, increase innovation, improve team dynamics and expand leadership pipelines. Clients include American Express, Capital One, Coca-Cola, Harvard Business School, Procter & Gamble, Thyssen-Krupp, and a diverse mix of Fortune 1000 corporations and major MBA programs.

About The Homefront Foundation The Homefront Foundation, a registered 501c3 nonprofit organization focused on teaching veterans and service members how to tell their story. By using The Ariel Group’s techniques, and developing their own structured approach, these stories can be therapeutic, serve as a coping strategy, and they allow for individuals to reconnect and build relationships in their communities, in their workplace, and most importantly, in their homes.
