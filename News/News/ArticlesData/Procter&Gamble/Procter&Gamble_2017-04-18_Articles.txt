Jambora - @inquirerdotnet Philippine Daily Inquirer / 02:23 AM April 18, 2017 Rochelle Rivera, senior scientist engineer, P&G Innovation Center, talking about how Safeguard soaps are produced SINGAPORE—An exclusive, first-ever tour of the Safeguard Science Discovery headquarters here demonstrated the importance of keeping oneself clean to avoid diseases—some potentially life-threatening—from spreading. The tour at the P&G headquarters in Singapore included restricted laboratory visits, where members of the press and mom-bloggers were shown how germs breed, and how Safeguard formulates its antibacterial GermShield+ soaps to prevent diseases in the household. Safeguard, first formulated in 1966 as a way to remove germs and inhibit germ regrowth, remains as effective today as it was back then. Leading health experts on germ protection for the family have been recommending Safeguard for more than 50 years, and the company continues to invest in research and development. ADVERTISEMENT “Some germs that can infect us when we do not wash our hands are rotavirus and rhinovirus,” said Angelica Caranza, section head of the Global Microbiology Capability Organization of P&G Innovation Center in Singapore. “Rotavirus is the leading cause of acute gastroenteritis, resulting in the death of over 600,000 children annually worldwide,” Caranza pointed out. “Rhinovirus causes the common cold. Other germs, such as E. coli, shigella and campylobacter can cause diarrhea, which can be life-threatening due to severe dehydration.” First step Proper handwashing and bathing using Safeguard is the first step to protect yourself and your family from germ threats. The Germshield+ also inhibits germ regrowth for up to 24 hours. Did you know, for example, that our bodies host as many as 10,000 bacterial species, and that the number of bacteria that live in and on us outnumber our own human cells 10 to 1? When a coworker reports for work sick, about half of the commonly touched surfaces in the office will become infected with the virus by lunchtime. Among the dirtiest objects you can own is your phone, which can have up to 4,200 bacteria from fecal contamination. A single bacteria cell in the bathroom can multiply into one billion cells overnight. That said, a shopping cart can contain more fecal E. coli than a supermarket toilet. “Normal skin is colonized by large numbers of commensal microorganisms or resident bacteria that live on the surface of the skin,” Caranza said. “Most of these microorganisms are harmless or are even beneficial to their host. However, there are microorganisms known as transient bacteria such as S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, E. coli, and K. pneumoniae that can be picked up by the hands from different surfaces in our surroundings.” These can be easily transferred to the mouth, nose and eyes since people touch their faces several times an hour. These germs can cause skin infections, respiratory diseases and diarrhea. ADVERTISEMENT “Some microbes are pathogenic, which means they can make a healthy person sick, such as the bacteria salmonella typhi, which causes typhoid fever,” Caranza added. “There are also opportunistic germs that are usually harmless to healthy hosts but can cause sickness if the immune system is compromised. Some strains of S. aureus can also cause a skin infection when the skin barrier is damaged.” Effective, simple Good handwashing habits, Caranza said, are an effective and simple way to prevent the transmission of germs, as recommend by the World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDCP). “It is important to follow the effective steps to handwashing, which are: wet, lather, scrub, rinse and dry,” she noted. Caranza added that P&G Phils., with the Department of Health and Department of Education, was able to teach good handwashing practices to over 1.5 million schoolchildren this school year through the Superkid and Commander Safeguard School Caravan. She said Safeguard will continue to reach out and educate even more children in the coming school year on the importance of proper handwashing in minimizing the transmission of germs in schools and in keeping oneself healthy. Germ-hunting in Singapore US CDCP has recommendations on when people should wash their hands: Before, during and after preparing food; before eating food; before and after caring for someone who is sick; before and after treating a cut or wound; after using the toilet; after changing diapers or cleaning up a child who has used the toilet; after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing; after touching an animal, animal feed or animal waste; after handling pet food or pet treats; and after touching garbage. “There are different types of diseases that we can get by not washing our hands. Some are life-threatening, while others are not. Skin infections such as boils and impetigo that can be caused by S. aureus are not life-threatening, but can significantly impact the quality of life,” Caranza said. Broad spectrum Safeguard with Germshield+ technology can fight a broad spectrum of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and fungi, preventing more types of sickness, malodor and skin infection. Is there such thing as being too clean, or does being “too clean” compromise the immune system in any way? “‘Too clean’ may be subjective, as it depends on personal habits and environments. What is widely agreed on by experts is that the immune system can be susceptible to a variety of illnesses, and good hand hygiene is essential to reducing the incidence of sickness and spreading germs to others,” Caranza said. play_circle_filled Japan's cherry blossom season kicks off April 09, 2017 play_circle_filled Rare original 'Tintin' drawing goes for $798,000 at auction April 09, 2017 play_circle_filled Relic of St. John Paul II gives PH message of hope, humanity April 07, 2017 play_circle_filled Fireworks display opens new South Korean skycraper April 02, 2017 TAGS: Bacteria, Health, proper handwashing For feedback, complaints, or inquiries, contact us.

Read More MUMBAI: Procter & Gamble (P&G), the world's biggest consumer goods company, has tied up with Future Group for joint sales forecasting and planning, exclusive product releases and the companies will embed officials from each at the headquarters and be part of supplychain initiatives. The two companies have met nearly four times over the year in India and the global headquarters of P&G at Cincinnati to take their association beyond the retailer-client relationship. P&G's global CEO David Taylor is currently in India for the MoU, which will be akin to the one it has with Walmart in the US. ET first reported on their likely alliance last year in October. "It will help us to grow sales and for P&G, it will lead to an increased market share. There will be collaboration in a lot of things including supply chain, planning strategies and managing shelf space," said Kishore Biyani, founder of Future Group, which is the country's laryer gest retail firm. Globally, P&G sells about 14% of its annual sales or nearly $10 billion worth of consumer goods through Walmart. In India, Future Group has the widest network with around 13 million square feet of retail space in 221 cities through a 800-strong store network of supermarket brands such as Big Bazaar, EasyDay and Nilgiris. Future Group is also a large buyer from big clients operating in India including Hindustan Unilever and Nestle. However, Biyani asserts "Rest are transactional relationships but this is a strategic one." P&G's three entities in India, which sell products ranging from detergents and shampoo to razors and sanitary napkins, have a combined revenue of under $2 billion, less than 3% of its overall global sales. The business pales in comparison with Unilever's at nearly thrice as big in the country with products across price points. "It is standard practice for us to engage with our partners across the retail landscape including all our partners in modern retail, e-commerce and traditional retail to develop unique plans that create superior value for the shopper," said aP&G spokesperson. Unlike the Indian unit of Anglo-Dutch rival, P&G has been more focused on premium products that generate high sales at modern trade outlets in contrast to its rivals' route of stocking several mass brands on retail shelves. Experts said they can align their needs with that of a retailer. "This will allow P&G to bring newer brands and categories into India which can be incubated in modern stores through our stores," said Devendra Chawla, group president of FMCG and brands at Future Group.

Up to 50 new staff could be hired, the company said. Called an E-Centre, the project was officially launched yesterday in partnership with the Economic Development Board. As it does not have a single, fixed location, staff involved in its activities will work either in P&G's Singapore Innovation Centre in Biopolis Street or its offices at The Metropolis. P&G said the project reaffirmed its commitment to Singapore and was aimed at strengthening the country's standing as a leading digital and e-commerce global hub. The centre will be pivotal to its digital innovation across its entire operations in three core areas: supply- chain management, analytics and e-commerce, it said. "This E-Centre will develop digital solutions for our Asia-Pacific operations... It will synchronise the supply chain to increase revenues and lower inventory while serving emerging retail channels more efficiently," said Mr Magesvaran Suranjan, P&G's president for the Asia-Pacific region, at yesterday's launch. For supply-chain management, the centre will focus on achieving greater accuracy, visibility and efficiency across operations. PIVOTAL TO DIGITAL INNOVATION This E-Centre will develop digital solutions for our Asia-Pacific operations... It will synchronise the supply chain to increase revenues and lower inventory while serving emerging retail channels more efficiently. MR MAGESVARAN SURANJAN, P&G's president for the Asia-Pacific region. Some projects in the pipeline include machine learning, where algorithms allow machines to predict parameters within the supply chain for better accuracy, as well as process automation, which uses robotics to eliminate repetitive tasks. The centre will also use data analytics to optimise product distribution and marketing strategies across the region. For example, by analysing an area's demographics data, P&G will be able to determine the potential sales growth and prioritise store distribution accordingly. Mr Suranjan also said that through the centre, the company will expand its partnerships with small and medium-sized enterprises as well as start-ups to strengthen their digital capabilities and jointly develop new digital solutions. P&G also announced that it will be training 40 of its existing employees in the first year to take on digital-related roles in the centre related to the three core areas. It will also look to hire up to 50 new employees to take on similar positions in the centre, said Mr Nicolas Defauw, P&G's vice-president of finance and accounting in the Asia-Pacific region. Speaking at the launch yesterday, Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) S. Iswaran highlighted the importance of equipping workers with digital skill sets. "Digitalisation will have a profound impact on the nature and content of jobs, and the way we work. Hence, we will continue to partner the industry and education institutions to equip our people with the skill sets that are needed to succeed in the digital economy," he said. "Preparing our industries, firms and workforce for the changes and opportunities of the digital economy is a major priority for Singapore," he added. P&G's consumer brands include Gillette, Oral-B and Pampers.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 18 April 2017 by Military News Mission NOT Impossible — the new age of transparency in China’s programmatic buying SEATTLE, April 10, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — Programmatic buying is blooming in the spring of the Chinese advertising market. According to eMarketer, investment on programmatic buying in China will reach 16.7 billion dollars in 2017, with a 51.5% increase than 2016. However, as many unqualified companies flooded into the industry, underneath the image of prosperity, the threat of non-transparency reveals. Transparency is a challenging goal for the Chinese market because the fraud network is deeply embedded in the entire industry of advertising. Digital advertising is under attack by unethical behaviors of some companies who intentionally leave technologies unclarified, fall into moral myopia, pursue only short-term profits, or refuse to disclose key information. The ubiquity of fraud significantly hurt advertisers’ trust in digital advertising, and they decided to fight back. At this year’s IAB Annual Leadership Meeting, P&G Chief Marketing Officer Marc Pritchard called for ad agencies to get to „a transparent, clean and productive media supply chain” in the face of „crappy advertising accompanied by even crappier viewing experiences.” Like P&G, advertisers will no longer waste their time and money on a non-transparent media supply chain. Driving industry-wide transparency becomes the top priority for advertisers. According to Grace Huang, founder and CEO of iPinYou, „Advertisers distrust digital advertising due to the fact that the entire digital advertising chain is like a black box. As some companies unethically brag about the technologies they don’t really possess, the negative impact of the black box is amplified. Breaking the black box becomes inevitable.” To address the need of transparency, all media and technology companies must take actions immediately. As the leading DSP company with over 59% market share in China, iPinYou takes the lead in promoting a transparent, clean and safe digital advertising environment. Since its establishment, iPinYou always focuses on providing the most premium traffic to clients. With zero tolerance on fraud, iPinYou promises that once fraud is detected, all traffic will be refunded. Taking a bottom-up approach, iPinYou developed products based on big data and artificial intelligence, which aims to solve clients’ problem of inefficiency. It ensures that iPinYou always represents the advertisers’ interest. To achieve the goal of transparency, iPinYou has taken various strategies. First of all, iPinYou invested specialized expertise and advanced facilities. The company built anti-fraud forces, who conducted massive calculations. It aims at transparency with both hardware and software supports. iPinYou is highly confident in its business scale and competitiveness, which are essential in the anti-fraud battle. Second, iPinYou keeps building core technologies in big data and artificial intelligence. It provides intelligence solutions which do not only serve clients with multi-dimensional value-added intelligent data, but also create unconventional marketing models. iPinYou launched the digital advertising management platform Optimus Prime. Its features enable a transparent user experience including transparent billing, transparent data, and transparent traffic. Lastly, iPinYou has partnered with 15 industry leaders in the media supply chain in 2016, including advertisers, third-party tracking firms, and advertising associations. Together, the partnership made significant contributions to anti-fraud endeavors. iPinYou has set benchmarks for key evaluation metrics. Cooperated with world’s leading digital advertising companies XAXIS and Integral Ad Science (IAS), iPinYou published „Digital Advertising Anti-Fraud Best Practices.” Because of the determination on transparency, iPinYou earned trust from advertisers. Living through years of fierce competition in the Chinese market, iPinYou won the championship in programmatic buying. Holding tight on the principle of creating maximum value for customers, iPinYou will persistently pursue transparency through its big data and artificial intelligence technologies, and strategic partnership with industry leaders.

Photo: P&G mail print View all comments Tweet By Rumi Hardasmalani - rumih@mediacorp.com.sg - Published: 4:00 AM, April 19, 2017 Updated: 12:30 PM, April 19, 2017 SINGAPORE—Procter & Gamble (P&G) will be investing more than US$100 million (S$140 million) over the next five years in its new P&G E-Centre in Singapore. The consumer goods producer is locating its first digital innovation centre outside the United States, focused on end-to-end high-tech solutions across core areas including supply chain management, business processes and data analytics. The company will be hiring 50 employees to take on digital-related roles and will also expand its partnerships with local small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and start-ups to strengthen digital capabilities and co-develop new digital solutions, said Mr Nicolas Defauw, P&G’s vice-president of finance and accounting, Asia-Pacific. Noting that P&G’s presence in Singapore has grown from a 100-strong sales team in 1987 to its current staff strength of 2,000, including 400 researchers at its Singapore Innovation Centre, Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) S Iswaran reiterated the Government’s commitment to partner the industry to anchor new digital capabilities and to equip Singaporeans with new digital skill sets. His remarks were made at the opening of the P&G E-Centre yesterday. P&G works with more than 200 SME partners and aims to build a digital ecosystem for the industry in Singapore. In addition, the company trains more than 500 managers annually at the Asia Leadership Development Centre in Singapore. Golden Wheel Industries (GWI), which provides contract manufacturing and packaging services, is one of the partners. The local company develops sample batches of P&G’s hair, skincare and consumer products. The experience and skills GWI gained in working with digital systems have enabled the company to enhance its services to its clients. According to Mr Lee Kwai Seng, director at GWI, there is a lot for the SMEs to learn from bigger companies such as P&G. “The SMEs, while collaborating with larger companies, must take a longer-term view and put in place efficient processes to grow the business and make it a win-win, instead of entirely focusing on the margins. We have learnt to be more efficient besides gaining insights into how to process information to support our business and have effectively revamped our inventory management system,” Mr Lee said. “In the digital world, it is all about the ecosystem, one company cannot drive on its own … By training and developing SMEs, we can have a much stronger ecosystem that serves the digital economy,” said Mr Defauw. Singapore’s position as the group’s regional headquarters, combined with the talent available in digital technology and research, was a key factor that attracted the US group to set up its E-Centre in the Republic. The strong partnership between the universities, agencies and SMEs is also an advantage, he added. Yesterday, the company hosted the second edition of its leadership development programme — the P&G Leadership College — for SMEs in collaboration with enterprise agency Spring Singapore. Aimed at fostering mutually beneficial collaborations between large organisations and SMEs through projects involving knowledge transfer and capability upgrading, the half-day training programme this year saw more than 30 business leaders participate, gaining insights into digital and e-commerce innovations from speakers of companies such as Ematic Solutions, Google, NTUC Fairprice and Uber.

Company Summary NSE BSE Procter & Gamble Loading data... ADD TO PORTFOLIO ADD TO WATCHLIST SHARE YOUR OULOOK ChartsValuation & Peer ComparisonCommunity Buzz PEER COMPANIES Hindustan UniLever Loading data... ADD TO PORTFOLIO ADD TO WATCHLIST SHARE YOUR OULOOK ChartsValuation & Peer ComparisonCommunity Buzz PEER COMPANIES MUMBAI: Procter & Gamble (P&G), the world's biggest consumer goods company, has tied up with Future Group for joint sales forecasting and planning, exclusive product releases and the companies will embed officials from each at the headquarters and be part of supplychain initiatives. The two companies have met nearly four times over the year in India and the global headquarters of P&G at Cincinnati to take their association beyond the retailer-client relationship. P&G's global CEO David Taylor is currently in India for the MoU, which will be akin to the one it has with Walmart in the US. ET first reported on their likely alliance last year in October. "It will help us to grow sales and for P&G, it will lead to an increased market share. There will be collaboration in a lot of things including supply chain, planning strategies and managing shelf space," said Kishore Biyani, founder of Future Group, which is the country's laryer gest retail firm. Globally, P&G sells about 14% of its annual sales or nearly $10 billion worth of consumer goods through Walmart. In India, Future Group has the widest network with around 13 million square feet of retail space in 221 cities through a 800-strong store network of supermarket brands such as Big Bazaar, EasyDay and Nilgiris. Future Group is also a large buyer from big clients operating in India including Hindustan Unilever and Nestle. However, Biyani asserts "Rest are transactional relationships but this is a strategic one." P&G's three entities in India, which sell products ranging from detergents and shampoo to razors and sanitary napkins, have a combined revenue of under $2 billion, less than 3% of its overall global sales. The business pales in comparison with Unilever's at nearly thrice as big in the country with products across price points. "It is standard practice for us to engage with our partners across the retail landscape including all our partners in modern retail, e-commerce and traditional retail to develop unique plans that create superior value for the shopper," said aP&G spokesperson. Unlike the Indian unit of Anglo-Dutch rival, P&G has been more focused on premium products that generate high sales at modern trade outlets in contrast to its rivals' route of stocking several mass brands on retail shelves. Experts said they can align their needs with that of a retailer. "This will allow P&G to bring newer brands and categories into India which can be incubated in modern stores through our stores," said Devendra Chawla, group president of FMCG and brands at Future Group. P&G has invested Rs 2,000 crore in India in the past four years, mainly to set up manufacturing units to reduce dependence on pricier imports. At present, it has seven manufacturing facilities in six states, accounting for more than 90% of its products sold in the subcontinent.

David Sedgwick Email 14:00 Tuesday 18 April 2017 0 Have your say A group has been formed to help hundreds of staff at a threatened factory. In March, managers at Coty – formerly Proctor and Gamble – announced plans that could lead to the closure of the Seaton Delaval site, with the potential loss of 370 jobs. The proposal is still subject to consultation with employees, but should it go ahead it could lead to the closure of the factory by the end of 2018. Northumberland County Council and Arch, the Northumberland development company, have now formed a response group. It is being supported by Seaton Valley Community Council and a range of organisations including the Department of International Trade, JobCentre Plus, North East Enterprise Agencies Ltd, Northumberland College, National Careers Service, North East of England Process Industry Cluster, Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, and the Confederation of British Industry. Steven Mason, chief executive at Northumberland County Council, said: “The response group has held its first meeting and has resolved to develop support for the workers at this site for the short, medium and longer term. “Through Arch we will be keeping in touch with the company and monitoring the situation while consultation takes place with staff. “Priorities for the group, should the proposed closure go ahead, will be supporting employees and getting them back into work; supporting the local community and the supply chain; and working to secure a positive future for the site at Seaton Delaval. “The council is committed to supporting the local workforce and has a good track record of this type of activity – having worked closely with General Mills in Berwick to support staff when it announced its closure plans.” Coty, which produces a range of fragrances and make-up for leading brands, has expressed its support for the group and will be working with them over the coming months. The group plans to meet at regular intervals during the coming months and will report on progress. Blyth Valley MP Ronnie Campbell has also been raising the issue of the factory’s future in Parliament. In March, Coty said: “We have announced proposed changes to our international manufacturing network including our fragrance operation in Seaton Delaval. “These proposals are the result of a detailed study of our expanded global manufacturing capacities and capabilities for each of our divisions following the merger with P&G Specialty Beauty brands and with the objective to enable our future growth. “As a result of the study’s recommendations, we are proposing subject to Board approval, to consolidate our fragrance operations into fewer core centres which will result in the proposed closure of the Seaton plant. “Specific timelines are still under consideration and subject to consultation in relation to these proposals.” Trending Burglars target two Whitley Bay businesses Police name motorcyclist killed in crash Graham returns to his roots to take on dental practice Rare duck spotted in North Tyneside park Fly-tipper who dumped hundreds of tyres is fined Sign in {* #userInformationForm *} Sign in socially {* loginWidget *} with your email address {* traditionalSignIn_emailAddress *} {* traditionalSignIn_password *} {* traditionalSignIn_signInButton *} Forgot your password?

Infrastructure demand and consumerism will boost Asean's investment appeal: IE Singapore The move reaffirms P&G's commitment to Singapore and aims to strengthen the country's standing as a leading digital and e-commerce hub in the world. The P&G Singapore E-Center - the multinational company's first outside the United States - will be pivotal to its undertaking of end-to-end digital innovation across three core areas: supply chain management, e-analytics and e-business. In the area of supply chain management, termed "i-Supply", the E-Center will focus on transforming P&G's supply chain end-to-end, enabling greater accuracy, visibility and more efficient processes. The e-business unit aims to translate digital strategies into scalable plans for the region, and to leverage new digital channels to innovate and improve business models. Through its focus on e-analytics, the E-Center will also leverage predictive analytics and big data to optimize product distribution and marketing strategy. With the launch of the centre on Tuesday (April 18), P&G will be training 40 employees in the first year to take on digital-related roles in the three capability areas. Through the E-Center, P&G will also expand its partnerships with local small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and start-ups to strengthen digital capabilities and co-develop new digital solutions. To bolster the inauguration of the E-Center, P&G also hosted the second edition of its leadership development program - P&G Leadership College - for SMEs in collaboration with Spring Singapore. Speaking at the launch of the E-Center, Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) S Iswaran noted that Singapore serves as P&G's Asia-Pacific headquarters with 2,000 staff across a range of functions, including brand management, marketing, supply chain management, consumer insights, design and manufacturing. Singapore is also one of P&G's global hubs for innovation and talent development and the company employs 400 researchers at its Singapore Innovation Center (SGIC) and trains over 500 managers annually at its Asia Leadership Development Center here, said the minister. "We will continue to partner leading companies to anchor new digital capabilities, strengthen our local ecosystem, and equip our people with the requisite skillsets for the digital economy," said Mr Iswaran. "Our partnership with P&G is a good example of how we are doing this."

By Tas Bindi | April 19, 2017 -- 05:11 GMT (22:11 PDT) | Topic: Innovation Oracle has announced that it is acquiring ad measurement firm Moat for an undisclosed amount as part of its push into the media and marketing sectors. Founded in 2010, Moat allows advertisers and publishers to measure and track online ads. The company has raised more than $67 million in venture funding to date and boasts customers such as Facebook, Nestle, Procter & Gamble, Snapchat, Twitter, and Unilever. what's hot on zdnet DevOps: Where it's going and how to make the most of it F8 2017: Will Facebook have an answer to Alexa, AR, and AI? How to set up a new Windows 10 PC perfectly in one hour or less A Russian hacker has created his own 'starter pack' ransomware service In a statement on Tuesday, Oracle said Moat will bring data and analytics capabilities aimed at enhancing media buying for marketers and publishers. "With the Moat acquisition, Oracle Data Cloud now offers brands and publishers a full suite of targeting and measurement solutions to improve the outcome of virtually every type of digital advertising campaign," said Eric Roza, senior vice president and general manager of Oracle Data Cloud, in a statement. Moat will remain an independent platform within the Oracle Data Cloud division and Moat founder and CEO Jonah Goodhart will continue to run the division within Oracle, the companies said. At this stage, Oracle maintains that it's still reviewing the existing Moat product roadmap and is not able to provide further details as to what kind of features or capabilities it plans to add to Moat. Moat is not Oracle's first marketing tech-related acquisition. Back in 2014, the company acquired BlueKai, which takes a company's customer data and augments it with other information for personalised marketing campaigns, and Datalogix, which allows marketers to track how online advertising influences offline buying. In the last six months, Oracle has also made a slew of other acquisitions. Earlier this week, Oracle said it acquiring Wercker, a Dutch startup that provides tools for automating the process of testing and deploying code, to strengthen its container management offering. At the start of the year, Oracle acquired API development startup Apiary, known for its APIFlow platform that allows developers to build, test, and monitor APIs while supporting API Blueprint and OpenAPI industry standards. Oracle also bought DNS powerhouse Dyn in November last year to provide customers access to Dyn's traffic and performance tools, as well as allow them to optimise costs and boost website-based revenue streams. That same month, Oracle closed its $9.3 billion purchase of NetSuite to expand its cloud footprint and total addressable market into smaller companies. Meanwhile, Adobe and Salesforce are also continuing their to push into the marketing tech sector with marketing "clouds" of their own. Towards the end of last year, Adobe announced the acquisition of video advertising company TubeMogul for $540 million, while Salesforce purchased AI marketing company Krux for $700 million.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 19 April 2017 by Military News Oracle Buys Moat Oracle today announced that it has signed an agreement to acquire Moat, the fastest-growing digital measurement cloud company. Moat will join Oracle Data Cloud, which uses data and analytics to enhance media for leading marketers and publishers. The combination of Oracle and Moat will connect data to consumer attention for better media experiences and business outcomes. Moat will remain an independent platform within Oracle Data Cloud, providing trusted measurement, analytics, and intelligence to the world’s largest brands including Nestle, Procter & Gamble, and Unilever, and leading publishers such as ESPN, Facebook, NBCUniversal, Snapchat, and YouTube. Moat’s enterprise client base and industry-leading attention analytics and intelligence suite provide a strong complement to Oracle Data Cloud’s audience targeting and measurement solutions. “I am thrilled to welcome CEO Jonah Goodhart and the entire Moat team to Oracle Data Cloud,” said Eric Roza, SVP and GM of Oracle Data Cloud. “Moat has grown its attention analytics business by over 100% in the past year, providing actionable insights around viewability, brand safety, non-human traffic, and ad creative to over 600 publisher, brand and agency clients. With the Moat acquisition, Oracle Data Cloud now offers brands and publishers a full suite of targeting and measurement solutions to improve the outcome of virtually every type of digital advertising campaign.” “It is with great enthusiasm that we join forces with Oracle Data Cloud,” said Jonah Goodhart, CEO and Co-Founder of Moat. “When Oracle approached us about working together, we began to see the huge potential to jointly drive innovation. At our core, we believe there is an opportunity to fundamentally improve marketing and storytelling by brands and publishers through better data and analytics.” More information about this announcement is available at www.oracle.com/moat. Oracle is currently reviewing the existing Moat product roadmap and will be providing guidance to customers in accordance with Oracle’s standard product communication policies. Any resulting features and timing of release of such features as determined by Oracle’s review of Moat’s product roadmap are at the sole discretion of Oracle.

Airbnb’s Nancy King and TWBA\Chiat\Day’s Neil Barrie explain what the research revealed. Airbnb CMO Jonathan Mildenhall believes customer loyalty is fueled by an emotional connection. [Photo: ioulex, Groomer: Eliza Desch] By Robert Safian04.18.17 | 12:15 pm Fast Company recently got access to an internal study undertaken at Airbnb, which tries to quantify the impact that investing in brand-building can have on an enterprise. Precipitated by Airbnb chief marketing officer Jonathan Mildenhall—who previously was a top executive at Coca-Cola—the study’s underlying assumption is that the tech community does not understand and appreciate what brand strength delivers, and that by not leveraging that tool, Silicon Valley (for all its success) has left huge value unexploited. I sat down with Airbnb’s head of brand, Nancy King, and TWBA\Chiat\Day chief strategy officer Neil Barrie to discuss the internal study. An edited excerpt is below. You can find an abridged version of the study itself here. Fast Company: Airbnb recently undertook an internal study of iconic brands. Why? Nancy King: We have incredibly smart investors who are scrutinizing every decision we make. Last year we hired a new CFO, and the first thing he did was look at every place we were spending money. The value of brand is hard to explain to people who think in terms of spreadsheets and finance. The idea was to explain the value of a brand using terminology and language that people who sit on finance teams or are investors could understand. Neil Barrie: As a discipline, agencies and marketers haven’t always done the best job pointing out how what they do tangibly impacts the bottom line. It was an opportunity to create a shared language, a shared reference point. FC: There is a belief in much of Silicon Valley that you don’t need to invest in brand marketing because your product itself is the brand. NK: Our biggest barrier to growth was that people thought we were weird. We built a great product, a lot of people loved us. But a lot more people were never going to get to our product because they were scared about what we did. The barrier that they faced was not something we could solve at the product level. It was an emotional challenge. We needed to help normalize behavior that people weren’t comfortable with. FC: In your study, you identified five key brand attributes. NB: We asked ourselves, what do we mean by a truly iconic brand? The first characteristic is that they are instantly recognizable visually: You look at a Coca-Cola, at a Starbucks, you recognize that brand wherever you see it. One of the first things my kid said was “Starbucks,” pointing at a logo. The second ingredient is a universal value proposition. The third is that they genuinely play a role in culture. Apple, for instance, is not just taking from culture. They are actively driving culture. And then the fourth ingredient is, do they tap into higher-order values that transcend the product—and actually stand for something. The fifth is all about emotional connection, and that is really the root of it. That’s where a brand like Disney has really benefited. It has leveraged the power of emotion. We make decisions emotionally more than rationally. Brands have a unique ability to tap into that decision-making. FC: So how does an investment into being an iconic brand translate into money? NB: There are four dimensions of value. The first is financial: Brands are a financial asset on the balance sheet. That’s one reason you should invest in them. When Gillette was acquired by P&G, the value of the brand alone was $25 billion. Number two is consumer value: Brand drives consumer decision-making. Number three is growth: Brands that transcended their category and cross over into different products, a lot of them have a clear iconic vision. The way that Apple has managed to go from a desktop computer to an iPod to a phone to monitoring people’s fitness and being a watch, it’s coming from the same thing: creative tools for creative minds. That empowers and enables them. And the fourth value is cultural value: Iconic brands have a disproportionate share of cultural voice, and they hold the internal culture of companies. FC: Right now in the marketing world, there is a focus on metrics and data. You can measure the ROI, the return on investment, from every dollar that you spend. Building brand value is at the other end of that spectrum. How do you have that conversation with the Airbnb leadership? NK: When a company is growing as fast and organically as us, you can assume that it’s going to grow like that forever. But there are companies like Expedia or Priceline that are spending five times as much trying to go after the same people, trying to move into our space. How do we win against them over time? New startups are also coming in, trying to replicate our business model. How do we win against that? Historically there was a belief in Silicon Valley that technological IP made you win. You have something that nobody else can build. You patent it. But Airbnb doesn’t have that. In an environment where people can copy what we have, what prevents people from choosing those other companies over us? FC: You spent a lot of money on your “We Accept” Super Bowl ad. Was there a discussion beforehand about the metrics for the return on that investment? NK: Candidly, the Super Bowl ad was more art than science. It’s an example of how we use our brand as guardrails to make decisions. Our company mission is to create a world where anyone can belong anywhere. You have to create more acceptance. And we were in an environment where there were a lot of questions about acceptance, and what it means to be accepted. We also had a conversation with our product team, and they elevated the point that the “accept” button on our website is actually the most used button. This video originally was not meant to be an ad; it was supposed to be on the site. But we recognized the power of the idea of acceptance, especially within the cultural narrative that was taking place. And really, we just decided to do it. It felt like the right thing to do. So far, I haven’t gotten any questions about what the ROI was on it. FC: If you hadn’t done the iconic brands study in advance, would the reception to the proposal to do the ad have been different? NK: Potentially. It’s a long journey to get people on board to the value of brand. The study has definitely helped reframe it. FC: Facebook has built this enormous global business without really spending on branding. Doesn’t Airbnb arguably have the same kind of viral loop that it can take advantage of, as hosts and customers market the platform for you? NB: Every disruptive company has a natural viral audience that word-of-mouth can take it to. If it’s a cool enough product, you’ll get the early adopters. But most brands, if you really want to scale, there’s a time when you need to cross over—in the case of Airbnb—from urban, metropolitan hipsters, people who think it’s cool to try this brand, to more lucrative audiences like young families or boomers who don’t think it’s cool to try this brand, it’s actually potentially risky. You need a whole different set of tactics and tools to do that. Every brand faces that moment when they have to cross the chasm. NK: We did a big global study to determine how big the audience was that would be most receptive to Airbnb. But there’s a much bigger group if you look at overall travelers. That’s really the challenge that we’re up against. FC: Was last year’s Live There campaign gauged to attack that? NK: Yes. That campaign was the first time as a company that we were able to talk about what we do in a way that was succinct and accessible. By talking about something people understood—living somewhere—you could explain something that they didn’t understand. It also changed the way we thought about our product mix. How do we build services for people when they’re in a particular place, so they can feel like they live there? That was the first example of product and marketing, two sides of the business, working together against a shared idea. FC: The product side is skeptical of the marketing side? NK: All product companies are skeptical of marketing. NB: Those of us in the advertising and marketing industry haven’t done enough to join up the two worlds. I judged the Effies the last couple of years, the global effectiveness awards for the communications industry. Quite a lot of entries have metrics that don’t really matter. “We really needed to be the most talked about sponsor of the World Cup,” or “We absolutely had to hijack the conversation around the Grammys.” But why did you need to do that? How does that help the mechanics of your business? NK: I’ve worked for companies that say, We’re trying to participate in the conversation around National Popcorn Day. If you think National Popcorn Day is a way to talk about your brand, then you probably haven’t figured out what your brand stands for. NB: Unless you’re a movie brand.

By TERESA F. LINDEMAN Pittsburgh Post-Gazette LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story PITTSBURGH – Somewhere in the vicinity of 169,000 Unilever employees were jolted by the news earlier this year that Kraft Heinz Co. had turned up in London with a $143 billion offer to buy their employer. No, no, said executives at the Anglo-Dutch consumer packaged goods giant, politely ushering the would-be buyers out the door. Thanks, but no thanks. Kraft Heinz – backed by funding and strategy from the food giant's majority owners 3G Capital and Berkshire Hathaway – now may be casting its eyes across the aisles of the world's grocery stores, looking for another tasty business that owns great brands but also has identifiable places to cut costs. General Mills with its 39,000 workers? Hershey and its 16,000 employees? Maybe Danone (99,000 workers), Campbell Soup (18,000), Kellogg (37,000), Procter & Gamble (105,000) or Mars (80,000)? Shares of Panera Bread (50,800 employees) rose briefly last week after a report that 3G Capital and Warren Buffett might try to buy it out from under an investment firm that announced a plan to acquire the restaurant chain. Later in the week, Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Pablo Zuanic put out a report saying that PepsiCo (264,000 employees) would be more vulnerable to a Kraft Heinz bid than Mondelez International (90,000 employees), the former Kraft sibling widely seen as a potential acquisition target. There sure are a lot of jobs tied up with the consumer packaged goods companies that stock the world's shelves with condiments, soups, shampoos, cereals, yogurt, pet food and other products used by the masses. It's an easy call that some of those positions could be on the block, if Kraft Heinz CEO Bernardo Hees and his team merge their 41,000-employee company with another icon of the industry. "They know how to run a business more efficiently than anyone else," said Brittany E. Weissman, a consumer analyst with Edward Jones in St. Louis. Whether you think that's good or bad depends on whether you're getting a paycheck from a food company or a dividend check from investing in one. As Kraft Heinz prepares for its annual shareholder meeting in Pittsburgh this week, Weissman seems inclined to believe that most of the company's investors are impressed by their management and are hungry for more. Earnings at the company that makes Ore-Ida french fries and Oscar Mayer hot dogs rose almost 50 percent in the last year, she said, and the company has improved profit margins at a level that outpaces competitors and peers. "I think they've definitely made their presence known in the food space," Weissman said. Another acquisition – wherever and whenever it gets done – could spell the end of one of Kraft Heinz's two headquarters locations, if the negotiators need to sweeten potential bids with offers to keep a significant presence in the next company's hometown. The 3G Capital and Berkshire Hathaway partnership acquired Pittsburgh food company H.J. Heinz Co. in 2013, keeping the family name on the city's NFL football stadium and inhabiting its downtown headquarters but moving to shutter plants and streamline the production system. Two years later, the owners merged Heinz with Kraft Foods Group and created the two-headed Kraft Heinz, with offices in Pittsburgh and Chicago. More jobs were trimmed, more production streamlined. In February 2013, the company had about 1,200 employees in the Pittsburgh region. Heinz CEO Bill Johnson, at the time, said keeping the headquarters in the city was in the contract. "I told them Pittsburgh was nonnegotiable," he said. As of last May, Kraft Heinz had about 800 workers in the region. The company now uses 22,000 square feet of office space in its headquarters, down from 95,000 square feet when it moved in back in 2008. Michael Mullen, senior vice president of corporate and government affairs for Heinz, last week reiterated the Kraft Heinz company's ties to Pittsburgh. "We have 41,000 employees globally as of our annual 10-K filing but are not disclosing head counts by office or location. Kraft Heinz remains committed to our co-headquarter locations in Pittsburgh and Chicago." He added that the food company remains committed to its partnership with the Steelers, who play at Heinz Field, and noted the company continues to give to local organizations such as the Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank, the Pittsburgh Symphony, Carnegie Museums and others. Few in the food business are unaware that they might draw the eye of Kraft Heinz, Weissman said. Management at many companies has been trying to step up the pace of growth – not easy in an industry that has plateaued and is facing incursions by small rivals promising less processed, more natural food products. Bernstein analyst Alexia Howard last week issued a report on the U.S. packaged food industry noting that sales volumes at packaged food companies fell in the 2015-16 period, as consumers chose fresher foods. Margins could face more pressure as retailers and manufacturers battle over price and promotional expenses, she said. Borrowing a page from the competition, food companies have embraced the zero-based budgeting technique practiced by 3G Capital, which requires that every new budget start from scratch and every expense be justified. That looks good to investors, whose interests don't necessarily align with those of the employees who might be shed along with the expenses. Unilever announced recently that it had reviewed its portfolio after the near miss with Kraft Heinz and plans to sell or spin off its margarine and spreads business. The company's effort to maximize shareholder value also included paying a higher dividend and seeking "greater efficiency in our cost base through zero-based budgeting." Where Kraft Heinz hasn't separated itself from the pack is in invigorating sales. Last year it reported a 0.3 percent rise in organic net sales, excluding the impact of currency rates and divestitures. Weissman notes that while management may not have gotten the sales spike it had hoped for from the pantry of iconic products it bought, she does count some of its efforts as successful, citing the introduction of Heinz mustard to the consumer market as an example. "They've done a decent job renovating some of their portfolio," she said. The marketing team has had some wins, too, garnering attention with stunts such as a low-cost campaign for a national day off to recover from the Super Bowl and the production of some ads that executed a pitch offered by a character in the hit cable TV show "Mad Men." In Howard's view, the surviving U.S. packaged-food companies will be those that can shift from their legacy businesses into more profitable spots. That might include moving into new geographic areas, buying up challenger brands and getting more products into the perimeter of grocery stores. Short term, Weissman expects Kraft Heinz to look for an acquisition target like Unilever that has extensive international operations, allowing ways to leverage North American brands into new markets worldwide. That issue also played a role in Zuanic's focus on PepsiCo as a possible merger partner. "From the Unilever bid, we learned Kraft Heinz wants size (no news really) and international exposure (which should rule out General Mills) ...," he wrote in a report last week. Kraft Heinz in February said it expects its integration program to deliver $1.7 billion in pretax savings by the end of 2017. After that, big rewards coming from the cost-cutting programs may start to dry up, and Weissman sees that as helping drive the push for another significant acquisition. The Unilever setback may have slowed the process, but the company's managers will regroup, she said. "I think these guys are smart. They have a list of candidates." For his part, Mullen said Kraft Heinz doesn't need to do another deal. "Our combination of iconic brands and global platforms puts us in a great position to drive profitable growth in markets around the world. As such, we don't need another acquisition to drive profitable growth for the long term," he said. "Kraft Heinz will continue to drive profitable growth and meet consumer needs around the world – with or without another acquisition."

Amore Pacific Becomes World's 7th-Biggest Cosmetics Maker By Lee Hai-woon Facebook 0 Twitter 0 E-mail More Google+ LinkedIn KakaoStory April 18, 2017 12:46 Amore Pacific has become the world's 7th biggest cosmetics maker thanks chiefly to booming sales in Asia. Amore Pacific is the first Korean cosmetics firm to feature in the top 10 at all, beating even established behemoths Johnson and Johnson, Chanel and Avon, as well as Kao and Guerlain to rise five notches last year. Perennial leader L'Oréal took the top spot, followed by Unilever, Procter & Gamble, and Estée Lauder. LG Household and Healthcare's global ranking also rose from 19th in 2015 to 17th last year. Industry bible Women's Wear Daily published the global rankings on Monday based on sales. It was only in 2007 that Amore Pacific entered the top 20. Park Jong-dae, an analyst at Hana Daetoo Securities, said, "The cosmetics industry has been a leading top-end industry dominated by the U.S., Europe and Japan, and if Amore Pacific wants to make further headway it has to succeed not just in China but in the U.S. and Europe as well." The rapid growth is due to a successful strategy of focusing on cosmetics that highlight natural skin tones, differentiating itself from rivals who focused on color makeup. Amore Pacific achieved sales of W6.7 trillion last year and a quarter of that came from overseas (US$1=W1,138). Adding in duty-free shop sales, which accounted for another 25 percent of 2016 revenues, almost half came from non-Korean customers. WWD attributed the success to the steady sales of its top five brands in China, which mostly focus on skincare products. Now the firm wants to step up marketing in the U.S. and Europe. It plans to expand its product portfolio by making an additional brand available in Europe and in the U.S. in the second half of this year. "The focus in the European market is shifting from color makeup and perfume to products that promote healthy skin, so our products have a competitive edge there," a spokesman said. The company also plans to diversify markets in Southeast Asia to deal with an unofficial Chinese boycott of Korean brands over the stationing of a Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense battery here. Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand will be used as bridgeheads to expand sales networks into emerging markets like Vietnam, Indonesia and the Philippines. Amore Pacific also set up a Middle Eastern branch in Dubai last year and plans to expand sales with more diversified products there later this year.

Nujeen Mustafa is the latest speaker to be confirmed for the TEDxExeter conference at the Exeter Northcott Theatre on Friday, April 21. Her journey is all the more extraordinary, as Nujeen has cerebral palsy and cannot walk. Return to Devon Live home page or read next: Outrage at 'retard' jibe used by Exeter pub's Facebook account This did not stop her braving the Mediterranean in search of an education and the medical treatment she needs. Growing up in Syria, Nujeen was unable to go to school. She learned English by watching American television programmes while stuck in a fifth-floor apartment in Aleppo. When the civil war broke out around them, Nujeen and her family fled first to Kobane, then across the border to Turkey. They joined thousands of other people displaced from their homes by the fighting on a perilous journey in search of asylum. She says for the first time in her life, she felt useful because she was able to translate for her sister Nasrine as the pair navigated their way across seven borders.

Nobel Peace Prize laureate Malala Yousafzai has said of Nujeen: "She is our hero. Everyone must read her story. She will inspire you." Now 18 and living in Cologne with her brother and sister, Nujeen will visit Exeter the day after her book is published in the UK. Claire Kennedy, founder and curator of TEDxExeter, said: "We've heard some truly humbling and inspirational talks at our first five TEDxExeter events and I know Nujeen's will be another. "She has experienced more challenges in her first 18 years than most of us will in a lifetime. I'm delighted that Nujeen is able to join us to share her amazing story with our audience at the Northcott and our many viewers around the world. "It's certainly shaping up to be an uplifting day."

The theme of this year's event is HOPE. Christina Lamb is one of Britain's best-known foreign correspondents and has won numerous awards for her reporting on everything from wars in Afghanistan to Libyan detention cells. Other confirmed speakers include Virginie Helias, vice president of global sustainability at Procter & Gamble, and Rob Wilson, a serial social entrepreneur and co-founder of Undivided, a youth-led campaign to get the best possible Brexit deal for young people. Joining them will be Exeter College student James Craig and Madhumita Murgia, European technology correspondent at the Financial Times. There will also be performances from Devon drumming collective Kagemusha Taiko and Plymouth-based dance company Street Factory. More than 90 TEDxExeter viewing events are already planned at schools and workplaces across the city and further afield. Tickets for TEDxExeter 2017 sold out in just 16 minutes. But people who weren't lucky enough to get one can still watch the event as it is streamed live online. A public live stream event is being held at Exeter Library, where people will gather to watch the talks and discuss the issues raised during breaks and over lunch.

They then decided that Britain would be a soft touch so her family decided to become economic migrants and put themselves at real risk to travel here in order to take advantage of out wonderful benefits and health system. What a touching carefully spun narrative. Yes I'm sure her life has been terrible, but so has countless others.

Deborshi Chaki Set up by Krishnaswami and Sean Novak, Lighthouse typically invests in the range of $5-20 million per transaction in consumer-facing firms. India-focused Lighthouse Funds is readying to raise its third and largest private equity (PE) fund, a top executive said. “Following the success of our last two funds, we are looking to raise $200 million for our third fund,” said Mukund Krishnaswami, founding partner of Lighthouse. Set up by Krishnaswami and Sean Novak, Lighthouse typically invests in the range of $5-20 million per transaction in consumer-facing firms. The fund inducted Sachin Bhartiya as a partner in 2007. Lighthouse Funds currently has a corpus of approximately $235 million. The PE fund has raised two funds of $100 million and $135 million. It has invested in 17 companies since it raised its first fund in 2009. “From the first fund we have made 11 investments and exited six, and have made one partial exit in a company called XSEED Education. At the time of investment, XSEED, which developed specialized academic programmes for its member schools, had close to 50,000 students enrolled and will end this academic year with approximately 1.6 million students,” Krishnaswami said. In the past year, Lighthouse exited its 2010 investment in agro-chemicals formulation firm Dhanuka Agritech Ltd, and its investment in premium biscuit maker Unibic Foods, in which it sold its stake to Peepul Capital for an undisclosed sum. Early this year, Lighthouse also sold its stake in Kolkata-based diagnostic chain, Suraksha Diagnostics, the details of which weren’t made public. “We exited Suraksha at a range of exit multiples between 2.5x-7x on invested capital… Overall, Lighthouse has returned 1.7x of invested capital, with four assets still to exit,” Krishnaswami said. Lighthouse closed its second fund in 2015 at $135 million, receiving a $42 million investment commitment from the US government’s development finance institution Overseas Private Investment Corporation. From the second fund, Lighthouse has made six investments till date. In March, the PE fund picked up a stake in Delhi-based non-banking financial company Capital Trust Ltd. It invested in Indian ethnic apparel and home accessories brand Fabindia in the previous month. The fund’s other notable investments include leading snack foods firm Bikaji Foods International and personal care brand Kama Ayurveda. To help its portfolio firms scale up, the PE fund has created an operating executive council, comprising a team of industry veterans including Ravi Chaturvedi, a former global president of Procter and Gamble Co. He works directly with the companies in Lighthouse’s portfolio. According to the India private equity 2017 report by Bain India, capital-raising is expected to be top priority for funds in 2017. However, investors surveyed also believe that the fund-raising environment will get more challenging this year. “A majority of funds reported greater participation from LPs (limited partners) in the form of passive co-investment rights in their current portfolio. Funds expect LPs to play a more active role in 2017 and will likely offer more co-investment opportunities,” the report said. India continued to be an attractive destination for investments. Fund allocations to India in 2016 increased by 8% over the previous year. The PE firms in the country were sitting on a dry powder of $9 billion, which was similar to 2015, reaffirming the potential for investments in the Indian market.

Home pregnancy tests are easy to use, inexpensive, and provide results in a few minutes. Most at-home pregnancy test provide 97% to 99% accurate results when used as per instructions. A urine pregnancy kit is used to detect human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) hormone, a special hormone that is produced only in a pregnant woman’s body. hCG production increases in the early days of pregnancy with its level doubling every 2 to 3 days in the blood. The presence of hCG above a particular range confirms pregnancy. Obtain Report Details @ http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/pregnancy-detection-kits-market.html The global pregnancy detection kits can be divided by product type, end-user, type of test, and region. The publication on the global pregnancy detection kits market makes for an interesting read due to its many offerings. This includes projections of the various segments and sub-segments based on their past and current performance. With the help of standard industry tools such as SWOT analysis and Porter’s Five Forces, the report provides a value chain analysis and market attractiveness analysis until the end of the forecast perioid in 2024. Global Pregnancy Detection Kits Market: Trends and Opportunities Increasing awareness about the availability of pregnancy detection kits, rising awareness about the utilization of self-detecting pregnancy kits and their benefits, and the increasing demand for self-detecting pregnancy kits are the major factors boosting the global market for pregnancy detection kits. Moreover, the rising adolescent pregnancy rate, promotional campaigns undertaken by manufacturers that engage celebrities to influence rural population for the utilization of pregnancy testing devices, technological advancements in pregnancy kits, and expansion of distribution network of product manufacturers for widespread availability of kits. However, high cost of pregnancy detection kits, which makes it unaffordable in undeveloped and developing countries is a major constraint to the market’s growth. In addition, the chances of inaccurate test result is also hampering the market’s growth. Global Pregnancy Detection Kits Market: Regional Outlook The report broadly divides the global pregnancy detection kits market into: North America, Asia Pacific, Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East and Africa. Of these, North America is the largest market for pregnancy detection kits due to high government spending for quality healthcare and increased awareness for the utilization of pregnancy detection devices. The region is followed by Europe due to the high adoption of digital pregnancy test kits along with rising disposable incomes. Asia Pacific is expected to emerge as a significant regional market due to the rising adoption of pregnancy detection kits in rural areas, increasing awareness about the benefits of early detection of pregnancy, growing population, and rising disposable income. Latin America is emerging as a significant regional market due to the increasing awareness about the benefits of early detection of pregnancy and the availability of pregnancy testing kits at affordable prices. The Middle East and Africa regional segment will display a sluggish growth due to low awareness about the usage of pregnancy testing kit and its associated benefits. Global Pregnancy Detection Kits Market: Competitive Scenario Some top players in the global pregnancy detection kits market include Alere Inc., Procter & Gamble Co., Church & Dwight, SPD Swiss Precision Diagnostics, Germaine Laboratories, Piramal Enterprises, Cardinal Health, Abbott Laboratories, DCC plc, Prestige Brands Holdings, Quidel Corporation, Kent Pharmaceuticals, Nantong egens bio Technology Company, and Confirm Biosciences.

New York-based Omnicom said organic revenue grew 8.1 percent in the UK and 8.2 percent in Europe, for the first quarter ended March 31. Results of the company, whose international sales made up about 44 percent of the total revenue in 2016, allayed concerns about its growth abroad following UK’s decision to leave the European Union. However, Omnicom, owner of agencies such as BBDO Worldwide, TBWA Worldwide and Goodby Silverstein & Partners, said negative impact of foreign exchange rates reduced revenue in the quarter by 1.2 percent. Omnicom, one of the ‘big four’ ad agencies, is being investigated by the U.S. Department of Justice along with fellow rivals such as Interpublic Group of Companies Inc <IPG.N> and Publicis Groupe SA <PUBP.PA> over rigged bids to favour in-house production units. “A dominating element…is a macro environment that remains very uncertain in terms of geopolitical issues and fiscal policies in the United States,” Pivotal research analyst Brian Wieser wrote in a pre-earnings note. Top advertising companies worldwide are increasingly looking to boost presence in digital media, with print ads drying up. Omnicom — which serves over 5,000 clients worldwide, including Procter & Gamble <PG.N>, Cisco Systems Inc <CSCO.O> and McDonald’s Corp <MCD.N> — said net income rose to $241.8 million (193.55 million pounds), or $1.02 per share, in the quarter, from $218.4 million, or 90 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, Omnicom earned 97 cents per share, beating the average analysts’ estimate of 96 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue, for the company which is one of the “big four” ad agencies, rose 2.5 percent to $3.59 billion, beating estimates of $3.55 billion.

ETF News Best ETFs Top Rated ETFs Best ETF Categories ETF Screener Tools ETF Screener Find Whats In Your ETF Find What ETFs Hold Your Stock Find ETFs By Leverage Find ETFs By Asset Class Free Newsletter Search Danger Lurking For Some REITs And REIT ETFs April 18, 2017 7:45am NYSE:REM ShareTweet From Contrarian Outlook: Real estate investment trusts (REITs) have essentially one job to do for their investors – pay reliable dividends. Many do, but when firms find their payouts in jeopardy things get ugly in a hurry. Which is why you need to avoid, or sell, the five ticking time bombs we’re going to discuss today. Dividend cuts don’t just “happen.” When a REIT slashes or suspends its dividend, it’s rarely a surprise – and rarely an isolated incident. Let’s consider Armour Residential REIT (ARR) – here’s five years of dividend cuts and misery: Sure, the current yield for Armour always looks good at 10% or higher. Problem is, its payout can’t be trusted. And neither can these five unsustainable dividends. Global Medical REIT (GMRE) Dividend Yield: 8.8% On its face, Global Medical REIT (GMRE) would look like a no-brainer buy – after all, it’s a nearly 9% yielder that plays in the ever-growing megatrend of healthcare? But GMRE is an odd bird with some serious problems. First off, Global Medical REIT comes from strange beginnings. The company started in 2011 as an internet dating site reviewer called Scoop Media, then was bought out in 2013 by Hong Kong real estate company ZH International Holdings. The company then turned Scoop Media into Global Medical REIT – a Maryland corporation that buys healthcare facilities, then leases them out under long-term triple-net leases – which then went public in June 2016. So far, no good. While the company’s revenues have exploded over the past year, its net losses have ballooned, too, from $1.61 million to $6.35 million. That filtered down to funds from operations (FFO) – an important measure of operational results that’s also useful in determining the integrity of the dividend – of negative 3.98 million in 2016, more than four times worse than its 2015 number! Adjusted FFO of negative 3 cents per share is troubling, considering GMRE pays out 20 cents per share per quarter in dividends. This stock is untested and off to a rough operational start, which is why it’s off 10% since its IPO – twice as bad as the broader REIT market. Even a Nearly 9% Dividend Can’t Carry Global Medical REIT (GMRE) AGNC Investment Corp. (AGNC) Dividend Yield: 10.7% AGNC Investment Corp. (AGNC) is an established player among mortgage real estate investment trusts (mREITs), but this high-yield name has struggled over the past few years, and its dividend looks downright wobbly at the moment. AGNC primarily invests in agency mortgage-backed securities – which are issued by government-sponsored groups such as Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. The company finances these typically through short-term secured loans referred to as “repurchase agreements.” And it does so at quite a bit of leverage – in fact, as of the end of 2016, AGNC boasted a tangible net book value “at risk” leverage ratio of 7.7x, much higher than many of its competitors. That’s up from 6.8x at the end 2015, cranked up in part to help finance the purchase of its external manager, American Capital Mortgage Management, which closed last July. Worse, the company also reduced its monthly dividend from 20 cents to 18 cents so it could better afford the $562 million deal … and that’s after reducing the dividend from 22 cents to 20 cents in 2015! AGNC is struggling to find financial footing, and its dividend track record is far from stellar. Avoid this at all costs – there are better ways to get high yield. AGNC Investment Corp. (AGNC): This Is NOT What a Dividend Chart Should Look Like! iShares Mortgage Real Estate Capped ETF (REM) Dividend Yield: 9.7% Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) can provide a number of benefits to investors, not the least of which is cheap, simple portfolio diversification. The iShares Mortgage Real Estate capped ETF (REM), however, is one of the best examples of when that diversification can come back to bite you in the rear. The REM is an ETF that holds a number of mREITs, and it carries a couple of gems, including Blackstone Mortgage Trust REIT (BXMT) and Apollo Commercial Real Estate Finance (ARI). However, combined they make up just about 8% of the fund’s weight. Drowning them out are Annaly Capital Management (NLY) – which I consider to be one of the most dangerous dividends of 2017 – and the aforementioned AGNC. Together, those two stocks account for more than a quarter of the fund’s performance! You’re better off picking a couple of individual winners and not letting your returns get weighed down by a crowd of losers. iShares’ REM Holds Back the Real Stars You see this dynamic play out in a number of international real estate ETFs, too. iShares International Developed Real Estate ETF (IFGL) and SPDR Dow Jones International Real Estate ETF (RWX) can yield in the 7% to 8% range, but their wide portfolios let in too much riff-raff, and their dividends are inconsistent to boot. Avoid these as well. Live Off Dividends Forever With This “Ultimate” Retirement Portfolio Each of these dividend duds has the potential to ruin your retirement. Sure, they yield 8%, 9%, 10% … at the moment. But how long will that yield hold up before financial troubles take the dividend down to 7%, 6% or lower? And what good is a big yield if capital losses are cutting your returns in half? You need substantial dividends that are built to last decades if you want to get through retirement without ever touching your nest egg – and that’s exactly the kind of picks I’ve complied to build my 8%-yielding “No Withdrawal” retirement portfolio! A lot of pundits recommend that retirement investors pour their money into blue chips like Procter & Gamble or Coca-Cola – companies that typically yield 3%, maybe 4% if you’re lucky. But if you do the math, you’ll quickly realize that strategy will leave you far short of the goal. That’s because 3% to 4% returns on a nest egg of half a million dollars will only generate $20,000 in annual income from dividends at the high end! You’ve worked way too hard in life to get so little out of retirement. But my “No Withdrawal” portfolio ensures that you won’t have to settle during the most important years of your life. I’ve put together an all-star portfolio that allows you to collect an 8% yield, while growing your nest egg – an important aspect of retirement investing that most other strategies leave out. I’ve spent most of the past few months digging into the high-dividend world, and I’ve had to weed out several yield traps that looked great on their surface, but potentially disastrous at a closer look. The result is an “ultimate” dividend portfolio that provides you with … No-doubt 6%, 7% even 8% yields – and in a couple of cases, double-digit dividends! The potential for 7% to 15% in annual capital gains Robust dividend growth that will keep up with (and beat) inflation This all-star cluster of stocks features the very best of several high-income assets, from preferred stocks to REITs to closed-end funds and more, that combine for a yield of more than 8%. This portfolio will let you live off dividend income alone without ever touching your nest egg. That means never having to worry about how you’ll pay your monthly bills, and never having to worry about wrecking your retirement account if disaster strikes. Don’t scrape by on meager blue-chip returns and Social Security checks. You’ve worked too hard to settle when it matters most. Instead, invest intelligently and collect big, dependable dividend checks that will let you see the world and live in comfort for the rest of your post-career life. Let me show you the path to the retirement you deserve. Click here and I’ll provide you with THREE special reports that show you how to build this “No Withdrawal” portfolio. You’ll get the names, tickers, buy prices and full analysis of their wealth-building potential – and it’s absolutely FREE!

Year-to-date, REM has gained 11.32%, versus a 4.94% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

Moreover, the rising adolescent pregnancy rate, promotional campaigns undertaken by manufacturers that engage celebrities to influence rural population for the utilization of pregnancy testing devices, technological advancements in pregnancy kits, and expansion of distribution network of product manufacturers for widespread availability of kits. However, high cost of pregnancy detection kits, which makes it unaffordable in undeveloped and developing countries is a major constraint to the market’s growth. In addition, the chances of inaccurate test result is also hampering the market’s growth. Global Pregnancy Detection Kits Market: Regional Outlook The report broadly divides the global pregnancy detection kits market into: North America, Asia Pacific, Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East and Africa. Of these, North America is the largest market for pregnancy detection kits due to high government spending for quality healthcare and increased awareness for the utilization of pregnancy detection devices. The region is followed by Europe due to the high adoption of digital pregnancy test kits along with rising disposable incomes. Asia Pacific is expected to emerge as a significant regional market due to the rising adoption of pregnancy detection kits in rural areas, increasing awareness about the benefits of early detection of pregnancy, growing population, and rising disposable income. Latin America is emerging as a significant regional market due to the increasing awareness about the benefits of early detection of pregnancy and the availability of pregnancy testing kits at affordable prices. The Middle East and Africa regional segment will display a sluggish growth due to low awareness about the usage of pregnancy testing kit and its associated benefits. Global Pregnancy Detection Kits Market: Competitive Scenario Some top players in the global pregnancy detection kits market include Alere Inc., Procter & Gamble Co., Church & Dwight, SPD Swiss Precision Diagnostics, Germaine Laboratories, Piramal Enterprises, Cardinal Health, Abbott Laboratories, DCC plc, Prestige Brands Holdings, Quidel Corporation, Kent Pharmaceuticals, Nantong egens bio Technology Company, and Confirm Biosciences.

The TV waiting game – is it necessary? Posted By: Britta Reidon: April 18, 2017In: Research, Television Print Email The Broadcast Research Council of South Africa (BRC) recently presented the latest BRC TAMS panel universe update. Since the BRC took over the task of restoring the panel to good health, there have been regular universe updates, but this was different. It was the big update, aligning the TAMS panel to the new Establishment Survey (ES). Funded by the BRC (68%) and the PRC (32%) (Publishers Research Council), the ES provides the media industry with a new and more representative view of the South African population and its size. It also gives a view of the composition of the population and cross platform broad media consumption habits. There was palpable tension amongst the agency planners and buyers with whom I talked before the presentation began. This was, perhaps, understandable. These were the people, who have to deliver on their TV audience projections on an ongoing basis. Many are accountable to media auditors, and their performance can determine their remuneration. Clare O’Neil, CEO of the BRC, had lined up an impressive team of co-presenters: Her research director, Setshwano Setshogo, Robert Ruud, the international auditor from 3m3a and Terry Murphy from Nielsen. In addition, Jennifer Daniel of Telmar also joined the presenting team for a post presentation panel discussion. The presentation began with a useful reminder that this panel, like any other, is an ongoing and evolving thing, requiring constant attendance and oversight in order to deliver stable and usable data. Panel churn, changing DStv subscriber numbers, household tenure, panel expansion and LSM movement are constant challenges that must be handled. In good health A quick overview of the panel’s vital signs proved that the panel was indeed, in good health. The panel size has been increased to 2905 household (up 9% from 2014). Polling rates are almost 95%, reporting is running at almost 92% the panel offers 91% coverage of South African TV sets. The weighting efficiencies were running at 74% for individuals and 66% for households. With the ES having been released the previous week, it was an opportune time for the BRC to share some information on the state of TV viewership in South Africa. For the future facing and tech obsessed media agency personnel, it is always a salutatory reminder that their habits are not those of the average South African TV viewer. More than nine out of 10 adults tune into the medium on a daily basis; 97% of viewers still watch on a TV set; only 10% watch on their mobile phones. 97% still watch TV in their homes. As Ruud succinctly pointed out, the local TV scene is running about 10 years behind Europe. Usage of video on demand (VOD) services, such as Netflix and ShowMax, are the indulgence of less than 1% of the population. This means, that certainly for the moment, the current panel can be relied upon to produce usable TV ratings. The ES is the mechanism by which, the evolution of TV viewing will be monitored, and will signal when it will be necessary to move beyond the current panel to cover multi-screen viewing. Ruud explained that in an ideal theoretical world with a perfectly representative panel, every respondent would have the same weight. Unfortunately, live panels are constantly churning, changing and evolving, and polling on any given day will not collect data from every single household. For the correct picture to be projected, the panel requires daily adjustments by weighting to ensure that data correctly reflects the universe defined by the ES. The weighting model Ruud explained that there are three types of factors that shape a weighting model. Statistical factors show clear correlations with the households’ viewing time e.g. household size and access to channels. Usability factors ensure that the data is relevant for its end users e.g. target market sizes must be stable in order for CPPs to be predictable. Legitimacy factors centre on good representation of the country’s population: the TAMs panel’s sample composition is an example of this. He then explained the new weighting model designed to align the TAMS panel to the ES. The new model represents a simplification and reduction of the weighting categories, centering on those factors which most influence viewership. Primary targets are age and gender. Language has historically been used as a politically correct but inexact proxy for race. The panel controls based on province, the new ES areas, Pay TV and non-Pay, race and household size. Ruud clearly demonstrated the benefits of the new weighting system: household weighting efficiency increases from 64.56% to 74.14%, and individual weighting efficiency soars from 73.36% to 93.28%. The maximum individual weighting has been reduced from 40 860 in August 2014 to 13 497! This places the panel amongst the best in the world. From the statistician’s point of view, it was clear that we have a truly for for purpose panel. Since the beginning of his involvement with with the TAMs panel, Ruud has pointed out the dangers presented by the volatile LSMs, and has strongly advocated that planners should not use them in planning as it is very hard to deliver when projections are made on inherently unstable data. LSMs no longer bear RIM weighting, but they remain available on the panel in deference to the fact that they have long been used for trading. In the panel discussion, Ruud indicated that this would make them no more unstable than they already are. Hard edge of TV planning It fell to Murphy to present the impact of the new RIM weighting structure on the data. Inevitably this task involved taking the audience through a large number of line and bar charts, comparing the previous data with the new test data by station and basic demographic grouping. Personally, I found it particularly confidence inspiring, that this duty should fall to someone who has not only had years of experience on the side of the TV broadcasters, but has been at the hard edge of P&G TV planning and buying. P&G is notorious in its demands, so Murphy absolutely understands what potential data variation means for agency planners and buyers. The pictures of overall and station viewership looked most reassuring. There are some variations as could be expected, but these were not large, and there are no shocking surprises. The surprise was that although the data was ready for release, the Advertising Media Forum (AMF) had requested that the data release be delayed until 5 June. While caution can be commendable, the problem is that it is not possible to run two (with old and new weightings) panels simultaneously, so there is no way to experiment planning with both sets of data. (This is unlike the situation with the RAM data, where the surveys are discrete and published, and it is really a matter of when the buyers and sellers of radio airtime, choose to make the transition.) Given that Nielsen believed the data was ready for release and that assessment had been sanctioned by the international auditor, the AMF was possibly erring on the side of super caution. Curiously there seemed to be something of a divide amongst agency personnel with the planners seeming to be keen to tackle the new data, and management being less keen. I tend to side with the planners on this issue. It is surely better to start working with the data, sooner rather than later. Obviously, the TV broadcasters will also be working with the new data for the first time. While the broadcasters clearly have to be cautious not to act in a collusive way when dealing with their buyers, I can not believe that they will not take a supportive stance and be open to assisting the planners to make the transition smoothly. Similarly, I cannot believe that the media auditors, who also subscribe to the BRC data, will not take a balanced view of performance over the initial transition period. Engagement over the transition period with broadcasters and auditors is surely the solution? Britta Reid is an independent media consultant.

New Jersey-based TerraCycle will take a wide range of rigid plastic items, from bottles and toys to picnic cutlery. “We find all kinds of things that get blown by the wind into the river, toys, pails, toboggans,” said Todd Sleeper, organizer of the Thames River Cleanup, ahead of this year’s effort Saturday. Much of the plastic collected isn’t accepted by municipal blue box programs or has deteriorated in the sun, sand and algae to the point it must be landfilled. TerraCycle has sent Sleeper 50 pre-paid packing slips for recovered plastics, and he’s passing them on to different groups of volunteers along the river. Each slip will cover almost 70 kilograms of plastic. “They’re expecting a lot from us,” Sleeper said. Last year’s cleanup signed up about 1,500 people to remove garbage along about 200 kilometres of the river. TerraCycle, which recently launched a worldwide beach cleanup campaign, sends plastic to Procter & Gamble Co. for reuse in packaging. P&G announced in January its Head & Shoulders shampoo bottles would be made with up to 25 per cent recycled beach plastic. “Anything that is rigid plastic is material we want and we can use,” said Brett Stevens, TerraCycle‘s vice-president of material sales and procurement. “As long as it is rigid plastic, we recycle 100 per cent of it.” The company is reaching out to groups already doing beach and river cleanups, and got in touch with Sleeper, Stevens said. Sleeper founded the Thames River Cleanup 17 years ago, and has overseen the annual effort since. Several years ago, he won the backing of London’s Nova Craft Canoe, which provides supplies and a canoe as a grand prize in an annual draw for volunteers. rrichmond@postmedia.com --- --- --- Thames River Cleanup When: April 22 Where: 17 communities, 50 cleanup sites, along 200 kilometres of river and tributaries Who: About 1,500 volunteers New this year: Plastic collection with TerraCycle More info: thamesrivercleanup.ca Featured Businesses Contact us to Advertise » Medical Fodemesi Health Step Charitable Organizations London's Million Tree Challenge Automotive Auto Spa Self Serve Car Wash & Dog Wash Go to the Marketplace » Contribute Send Your Scoop!

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 19 April 2017 by Military News Increasing Consumer Consciousness & Awareness Drives the Global Physician Dispensed Cosmeceuticals Market The market for physician dispensed cosmeceuticals has been undergoing a sea change with skincare specialist, dermatologists, and trichologists venturing into the market as entrepreneurs. Consequently, the vendor landscape in the market is becoming highly fragmented due to the mushrooming skin and hair treatment centers and clinics. The market therefore exhibits an abundance of products. It is important for products to conform to consumer expectations to gain a stronghold in this market. The ground level knowledge about the dynamic consumer preferences, adverse effects of a stressful lifestyle, damages caused to skin, eyes, and hair by UV rays, and the impact of pollution, are the primary factors fuelling the demand for quality physician dispensed cosmeceuticals. As per Transparency Market Research (TMR), these favorable factors will lead the global physician dispensed cosmeceuticals market to report a CAGR of 10.6% between 2016 and 2024. The market is expected to reach US$27.6 bn by the end of 2024, from a valuation of US$11.2 bn in 2015. Obtain Report Details @ www.transparencymarketresearch.com/physician-dispensed-co… Skincare Products Segment leads the Market, but Demand for Injectable Botox to Grow Rapidly By product type, the skincare products segment held the lion’s share in 2015. The prominence of skincare products can be attributed to the increasing demand for effective cosmeceuticals to treat dermatological conditions. Hence, the increasing consciousness among the aging population about their looks and the changing attitude of the middle-aged and geriatric population in developing countries bode well for the demand for physician dispensed cosmeceuticals. The anti-aging products segment is therefore expected to continue its dominance in the market through the forecast period. However, according to TMR, the demand for injectable Botox is expected to increase at a higher pace in the near future. North America Emerges as Key Region in Global Physician Dispensed Cosmeceuticals Market North America, being a mature market, makes a sizeable contribution to physician dispensed cosmeceuticals revenues worldwide. In 2015, the region also emerged dominant in the global market because it is technologically ahead of other geographical segments. As per TMR, the North America physician dispensed cosmeceuticals market stood at US$4.7 bn in 2015. Rising at a CAGR of 9.6%, the market is expected to reach US$10.52 bn by the end of 2024. However, TMR forecasts that the market in Asia Pacific will grow at the fastest rate during the forecast period. The increasing willingness among the aging and middle-income group population to pay for beauty and skincare products transcends into high demand for quality cosmeceuticals from this region. Furthermore, Asia Pacific boasts a high consumer base for skin whitening, acne treatment, and hyperpigmentation products due to its tropical climate and the higher ratio of teenage population. Bolstered by these factors, the market Asia Pacific is projected to rise at a CAGR of 12.3% between 2016 and 2024. Fill the form to gain deeper insights on this market @ www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag… Emerging Economies to Exhibit Impressive Opportunities for Increased Sales Likewise, the demand for physician dispensed cosmeceuticals across other emerging markets such as South Africa, Brazil, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE is expected to rise at a robust pace during the forecast period. On the flip side, high revenue generating cosmeceuticals products such as dermal fillers and Botox have a miniscule consumer base in developing and underdeveloped regions. This is mainly because of their high cost, apprehensions associated with using such products, and lack of sufficient knowledge regarding the use of these products. These factors have an adverse impact on the overall prospects of the market. Some of the key players operating in the market include Johnson & Johnson, Jan Marini Skin Research, Inc., Allergan plc, Procter & Gamble Co., L’Oreal S.A., Unilever plc, Valeant Pharmaceuticals Inc., and ZO Skin Health Inc. Among these enterprises L’Oreal S.A has emerged as the dominant player in the market.

"On a creative level, Asia is ahead now because they don't have the history and the years and years of advertising – the rules are not set. The clients are not serving history as much," he said. "They are saying: 'The market is exploding. What do we do?' And they are rushing to it with innovation. I would say they are leaving the 'copycat' worldview behind them." Sjoenell noted that the US, known as a global hub of advertising, is falling behind its Asian counterparts, with platforms such as WeChat – which Sjoenell calls "the best digital platform on the planet" – adding to the gap. "The US, even though it is a big market, is behind in so many ways. It's like (comparing) two countries: one half is an ancient, medieval country and the other is light years ahead of the rest. But in Asia in particular, innovation is going to win over simplicity," he explained. "There's a lot of inspiration available because every market is so different," he added. "So for Nike, people run very differently in Thailand than they do in the Philippines, and that makes the markets a great creative starting point. Whereas in the US, there's a lack of inspiration because these stories have been told so many times." In a tangentially related development, Procter & Gamble, the FMCG giant, has announced it is investing $100m in setting up a digital innovation centre in Singapore – its first outside the US – which will focus on supply chain management, e-analytics and e-business.
