PHOTO | FRANCIS NDERITU  By Lynet Igadwah, ligadwah@ke.nationmedia.com Posted  Sunday, January 22   2017 at  13:25 In Summary Initiative part of firm’s programme that has been running in Kenya for more than 10 years. Global product manufacturer Procter and Gamble (P&G) has partnered with World Vision in a Sh50 million project that will see 12 counties access clean drinking in efforts reduce to sickness and death. SHARE THIS STORY Tweet The campaign is part of the P&G’ Children’s Safe Drinking Water programme that has been running in Kenya for more than 10 years. Under the programme, 4-gram P&G Purifier sachets, each capable of filtering 10 litres of contaminated water in minutes will be distributed. Counties that will benefit from the program are Makueni, Machakos, Kitui, Kajiado, Taita Taveta, Narok, Kisumu, Isiolo, Marsabit, Elgeyo-Marakwet, Baringo and Homa Bay Water secretary Eugene Wamalwa welcomed the partnership saying it will help prevent deaths brought about by drinking contaminated water. He said the government targets to achieve universal access to water and sanitation by 2030 as envisaged in the National Development Plan and Sustainable Development Goals. “Currently, water coverage in the country is about 58 per cent while sewerage is 25 per cent in urban areas. To achieve our target we require to achieve 80 per cent water coverage by 2020 and attain the remaining 20 per cent by 2030,” he said. Mr Wamalwa said achieving the set targets would require a strong institutional framework, sound funding and public private partnerships. Under the P&G and World Vision project, 74,000 residents of the 12 counties would receive free water purifiers as well as lessons on water treatment and storage to improve sanitation and hygiene awareness. “To date, P&G has delivered over 11 billion litres of clean drinking water around the world, while in Kenya, we have provided almost a billion litres together with our partners,” said Vivek Sunder, managing director at P&G. He said the P&G goal is to deliver 15 billion litres by 2020 globally and expand Children’s Safe Drinking Water’s as the company’s commitment in mitigating the clean water crisis in partnership with NGOs, governments, companies and consumers. According to UN Habitat and United Nations Environment Programme 50 per cent of patients in hospitals are diagnosed with water related diseases. “If everyone everywhere had clean water, number of diarrheal deaths would be cut by 34 per cent, an indication that there is dire need for interventions that can avail clean drinking water to people,” said Mr Sunder. President Uhuru Kenyatta in September last year signed to law the Water Bill 2016 to streamline the water sector.

ChartsValuation & Peer ComparisonCommunity Buzz Close ✕ Budget 2017: This Budget could be the toughest test of Modi's life. Read about it in our Budget 2017 coverage MUMBAI: Procter & Gamble, the world's largest consumer products company, posted a decline in sales during October-December quarter, which the company attributed to the demonetisation of two high-value currency notes in India. “India demonetisation, the elimination of Rs 500, Rs 1000 bank notes that accounted for over 80% of that country’s currency in a cash-dominated economy was an unexpected head wind. It (sales) was flowing high single-digits growth last quarter to a decline of high singles this quarter," the company’s chief financial officer Jon Moeller said during an investor call on Friday. P&G's three entities in the country, which sell an array of products ranging from detergents to razors to sanitary napkins, had combined revenues of Rs 10,248 crore in last fiscal. The maker of Tide detergent and Pantene shampoo said organic sales grew 2% after a one percentage point drag due to portfolio rationalisation in Venezuela, and includes negative impact from Indian demonetisation apart from difficult operating environments in a few other markets. Last fiscal, the Cincinnati, US-based company posted a marginal decline in overall revenues after it de-focussed several unprofitable lines of business in India, which has negatively impacted its short-term topline growth rate. Besides, P&G has been more focused on premium products that generate high sales at modern trade outlets in contrast to its rivals who stock several mass brands on retail shelves. Various companies in the FMCG sector have reiterated that the government’s anti-black money measure would benefit the Indian economy in the medium term but that they have to brace themselves for a short-term blip. P&G's largest rival Unilever had warned that consumer spending would be impacted by lower cash in hand. Hindustan Unilever, the Indian unit of the British-Dutch multinational, said in a investor’s presentation in November: “In the short term, market growths to be adversely impacted for a few months.” According to industry experts, the demonetisation came at a time when consumer goods industry grew marginally by 1% in volume in the September quarter and most companies were looking to ramp up promotions and offers to persuade consumers to loosen purse strings. The FMCG sector continues to be in a flux with the liquidity crunch as retailers have held back on procuring new stock and suppliers are constrained by available credit. According to global performance management company Nielsen, the Rs 2.5-lakh-crore FMCG market could take a hit of nearly 1.5% of net sales, which works out to Rs 3,840 crore. Nitin Mathur, equity analyst at Jefferies India, said: "2017 presents an interesting dichotomy. While the shift from un-organised to organised trade is an imperative post demonetisation, this would come on the back of a weak macro environment, where the pace of premiumisation will be slowing down.

Share Premium brand strategy helps P&G up earnings Independent.ie Procter & Gamble's (P&G) drive to sell more upscale skin-care, grooming and house-cleaning products is beginning to show up in its bottom line. Sales of its premium brands helped lift earnings to $1.08 a share last quarter, excluding some items. Analysts estimated $1.06, on average. http://www.independent.ie/business/world/premium-brand-strategy-helps-pg-up-earnings-35387253.html http://www.independent.ie/incoming/article35387471.ece/bc24b/AUTOCROP/h342/Procter-Gamble.jpg Email Go To Comments The results reflect a crusade by chief executive David Taylor to get consumers to pay a bit more for the items in their bathroom cabinets and kitchen pantries. P&G's premium SK-II skin-care brand helped sales in the beauty division last quarter, and scent beads and Tide pods for high-efficiency washers boosted the home-care unit, giving the company a leg up on sellers of bargain health and cleaning products. "Over half of their product lineup is premium-oriented, so with an improving domestic economy, those products are doing well," said Jack Russo, an analyst at Edward Jones & Co. P&G rose as much as 3.9pc to $87.98 (€82.2) in New York, the most in almost three months. The stock gained 5.9pc last year, trailing the 9.5pc increase for the Standard & Poor's 500 Index. While total revenue slipped 0.3pc to $16.9bn (€15.8bn), that topped analysts' $16.8bn average estimate. Organic sales - which exclude the effects of acquisitions, divestitures and currency fluctuations - rose 2pc, Cincinnati-based P&G said in a statement. Sales by that measure rose 3pc in the beauty division. Organic sales gained 7pc in healthcare, driven by innovation in oral-care products. Organic sales increased 1pc in the grooming, fabric & home care and baby, feminine & family care units. The company reiterated its forecast that earnings per share, excluding some items, will gain at a mid-single-digit percentage this year. Organic sales may increase as much as 3pc, up from a previous projection of 2pc. Taylor, who took over as PG's ceo in November 2015 after 35 years with the company, pledged to make the owner of Tide, Pampers and Olay a more nimble and innovative competitor. P&G's challenges aren't unique. New brands, particularly those with natural or organic ingredients, have attracted younger shoppers, a trend that prompted Unilever's acquisition of Seventh Generation last year.

Hot Topics: Hiltz Murder Christo Cancels Over The River Gun Near School Senior Fun Fest Fremont's Exceptional Women E-Edition News Tips Print   Email   Font Resize Florence Pioneer Museum and Research Center to host Chili Bowl Posted:   01/18/2017 08:15:57 PM MST A Chili Bowl in a Chilly Museum The Florence Pioneer Museum and Research Center will host the second annual "A Chili Bowl in a Chilly Museum" from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Saturday at 100 E. Front St. in Florence. The community is invited to enjoy a cup of homemade chili in a handmade pottery bowl provided by P & G Pottery of Florence, for $5 each. Since the museum does not have a furnace, attendees should plan to dress warmly. Proceeds from the event go toward matching funds for a grant to help with infrastructure needs for the museum. Board Secretary Marty Lamm said last year's event raised nearly $3,000. The board needs to raise $35,000 to be able to add an HVAC system that won't stress artifacts by experiencing cold to hot temperatures. The museum closed in December because of cold temperatures and is expected to reopen for the season in mid-May, depending on weather conditions. During the 2016 season, 580 guests visited the museum from 32 states, the United Kingdom, Germany and Switzerland. During Saturday's event, attendees are invited to look at the museum's flag display, see the new light-up topographical map depicting where coal and oil deposits used to be in Florence, and learn more about the research center. For more information, visit www.florencepioneermuseum.org. Fremont County Republicans to host inauguration party Advertisement The Fremont County Republicans will host a potluck Inauguration Party from 6-8 p.m. Friday at Republican Headquarters, 603 Main St. to celebrate this historic inauguration of the country's new president, Donald Trump. All Fremont County residents are cordially invited and are encouraged to bring a dish or beverage to share.

The speech prompted concerns about protectionist trade policies, offsetting announcements of large infrastructure investment. There were no comments on fiscal stimulus, disappointing investors, whilst in the political front, his words failed to tend a hand to those that didn't vote him. The US is now a nation riven by a divisive campaign, and unless the new government works hard on it, the dollar will suffer the consequences. For the week ahead, the US will release its first GDP estimate for the last quarter of 2016, with the Markit January PMIs for the EU and the US will also see the light, and give a clearer picture of how economic growth is starting this 2017 in both economies. More signs of a dollar's bottom can be seen in the daily chart, as the pair is currently pressuring the 38.2% retracement of its November/January slide at 1.0710. The price is well above a bullish 20 DMA, now converging with the 23.6% retracement of the same decline around 1.0565, a line in the sand for bulls, as they would probably give up only on a break below it. The RSI indicator in the same chart heads higher around 59, while the Momentum indicator is easing modestly from overbought territory. Lastly, the 100 DMA maintains a sharp bearish slope around 1.0780, the next probable bullish target on a break above the mentioned Fibonacci resistance. Shorter term, the 4 hours chart shows that the price is above its 20 SMA, although technical indicators lack clear directional strength, hovering around their mid-lines. A daily ascendant trend line at 1.0610 this Monday, should offer support in case of retracements ahead of the mentioned 1.0565 level. Support levels: 1.0650 1.0610 1.0565 Resistance levels: 1.0710 1.0750 1.0780 USD/JPY The USD/JPY pair closed the week marginally higher in the 114.50 region, back from a two-month low of 112.56 achieved mid-week. The recovery was triggered by comments from FED's head Janet Yellen, who surprised markets with hawkish comments, as she warned about the risk of not raising rates, given the increasing inflationary pressures on the economy, saying that the Federal Reserve is ready to hike "a few times a year" until reaching 3.0% by 2019. Also, backing the advance in the USD/JPY pair, as the benchmark for the 10-year note bounced back from a weekly low of 2.309% to settle on Friday at 2.47%. The Japanese calendar was quite light these past few days, but this week, the country will release its latest inflation figures, expected to remain within deflationary territory, but slightly above previous ones. Despite the sharp bounce, the downward risk persists, as the price settled around the 23.6% retracement of the latest bullish run, unable to confirm a recovery above it, whilst technical indicators remain within bearish territory, slowly turning lower. In the same chart, the 100 DMA has advanced above the 200 DMA, with the shortest now converging with the 50% retracement of the same rally at 100.25. In the 4 hours chart, the pair presents a modest upward potential, as indicators are turning slightly higher within positive territory, but the price remains well below its 100 DMA, currently around 115.60. Support levels: 114.30 113.80 113.45 Resistance levels: 115.10 115.60 116.05 GBP/USD The GBP/USD pair closed the week with solid gains around 1.2373, holding on to Theresa May's triggered gains, and despite tepid macroeconomic figures released last Friday. UK Retail Sales for December disappointed big, as sales fell by 1.9% in the month, when compared to November, sending the year-on-year reading down to 4.3% from an expected 7.2% advance. Core figures ex-fuel, also missed expectations, down by 2.0% monthly basis, and up by just 4.9% when compared to a year before, against market's forecast of 7.2%. The main event this upcoming week is the Supreme Court ruling on Parliament's participation in the Brexit decision next Tuesday. May's conciliatory speech said that the government is willing to put the final deal to vote in both Houses, but she insisted that they will trigger art. 50 by the end of March. Pound's recovery was enough to erase the two previous weeks' losses, but not confirm further gains ahead, given that technical indicators lack directional strength within neutral territory, although the pair has held above a horizontal 20 DMA ever since breaking above it, now at 1.2250. In the 4 hours chart, the price is above its 20 SMA, whilst technical indicators hold directionless within positive territory. Above 1.2415, the weekly high, the pair can extend its gains towards the 1.2500 where strong selling interest will likely reject the advance. Support levels: 1.2260 1.2225 1.2190 Resistance levels: 1.2330 1.2375 1.2415 GOLD Spot gold closed the week at $1,207.44, up for a fourth consecutive week although the upward momentum moderated as the commodity reached the 1,200 threshold. Gold traded as high as 1,218.77 at the beginning of the week, but retreated on the back Yellen's hawkish comments over upcoming rate hikes. Nevertheless, it quickly recovered on a brief decline the mentioned figure, suggesting that the negative sentiment towards the greenback prevails. Technically, the daily chart shows that the price remains below a bearish 100 DMA at 1,219.63, but also well above a bullish 20 SMA, whilst the RSI indicator in the mentioned chart resumed its advance within bullish territory, after a limited downward correction from overbought readings, all of which supports some additional gains, particularly on a break above the mentioned 100 DMA. Shorter term, however, the risk is towards the downside, given that in the 4 hours chart, technical indicators failed to overcome their mid-lines and turned lower, whilst the price is struggling around a horizontal 20 SMA. Support levels: 1,204.70 1,195.80 1,182.90 Resistance levels: 1,219.65 1,229.90 1,241.35 WTI CRUDE West Texas intermediate crude oil futures closed the week flat at $53.20 a barrel, helped by a weaker greenback and comments from Saudi Arabia's energy minister, who said that 1.5 million bpd had already been taken out of the market, adding to signs that the oil market is rebalancing. Energy ministers from OPEC and non-OPEC countries met in Vienna on Sunday to monitor compliance with the deal to trim output, and comments are quite positive, as Saudi energy minister Khalid al-Falih said that compliance had been "fantastic," anticipating a strong opening for oil. Still, gains are expected to remain limited, on speculation countries outside the OPEC will increase pumping in the months to come. The US Baker Hughes report late Friday showed that the number of active oil rigs in the county, rose sharply, increasing by 29 to 522 for the week ending January 20, the largest weekly jump since the week of April 12, 2013. Technically, the daily chart shows that the price remains far above its 100 and 200 DMAs, but struggling around a horizontal 20 DMA, whilst technical indicators hold within neutral territory, with no clear directional strength. In the 4 hours chart, WTI presents a modest positive tone, with the price above all of its moving averages that anyway remain flat within a tight range, whilst technical indicators aim modestly higher within positive territory. Support levels: 52.80 52.10 51.50 Resistance levels: 53.65 54.30 55.00 DJIA US indexes closed higher on Friday, with the Dow Jon Industrial Average up by 94 points to 19,827.25, the Nasdaq Composite adding 0.28% to 5,555.33 and the S&P advancing 7 points to close at 2,271.31. The Dow reversed part of its latest losses, having closed in the red for five consecutive days, aided by positive earnings reports coming from Procter & Gamble and International Business Machines. General Electric shares, however, dropped as revenues fell short of market's estimates. The Dow eased from a daily high of 19,845 following Trump's inaugural speech, which failed to motivate buyers. From a technical point of view, the daily chart shows that the index remains below its 20 DMA, whilst technical indicators remain within neutral territory, indicating the absence of clear directional strength. Shorter term, and according to the 4 hours chart, the technical stance is also neutral, with indicators hovering around their mid-lines, and the index struggling with the 200 SMA, and below the 100 SMA, this last at 19,862. Support levels: 19,769 19,704 19,676 Resistance levels: 19,862 19,918 20,000 FTSE 100 The FTSE 100 remained under pressure on Friday, shedding 10 points to close the day at 7,198.44, ending the week in the red, down by 1.9%, for the first time in two months. Undermining the benchmark were poor UK retail sales figures last Friday, alongside with continued Pound's strength. Within the Footsie, the banking sector remained strong, with Lloyds Banking group up by 0.51& and Royal Bank of Scotland adding 0.36%, while mining-related equities closed mixed, AstraZeneca was the worst performer, down 3.36%. Daily basis the risk is towards the downside, as technical indicators keep heading lower from overbought territory, still within positive territory, whilst the benchmark is currently pressuring a still bullish 20 DMA. The daily low last Friday was set at 7,176, the level to break to confirm additional declines. Shorter term, and according to the 4 hours chart, further slides are yet to be confirmed, as technical indicators are bouncing from oversold territory, although the index is currently below a bearish 20 SMA, this last providing a strong dynamic resistance at 7,241. It would take a recovery above this last to deny a bearish extension and see the index recovering further towards its record highs. Support levels: 7,176 7,140 7,085 Resistance levels: 7,241 7,288 7,354 DAX Stocks in Europe closed marginally higher last Friday, with the German DAX up 33 points or 0.29%, closing the week at 11,630.13, unchanged weekly basis. Uncertainty ruled within European equities ahead of Trump's inaugural speech, alongside with self political woes. The banking sector maintained its positive tone, despite Trump failed to clarify regulatory laws, with Commerzbank advancing 2.82% and Deutsche bank up by 1.50%. The index is still within a consolidative phase, as the daily chart shows that it held above a horizontal 20 DMA, while the Momentum indicator remains within neutral territory. The downward potential however, seems limited as the RSI indicator turned modestly higher, now around 63. In the 4 hours chart, the DAX maintains the neutral stance seen on previous updates, with the benchmark anyway above its moving averages, but technical indicators lacking directional strength, right above their mid-lines. Support levels: 11,554 11,490 11,440 Resistance levels: 11,629 11,694 11,740   About the Author HY Markets More from HY Markets: Foreign Exchange Market Commentary (27 January 2017) Foreign Exchange Market Commentary (26 January 2017) Foreign Exchange Market Commentary (25 January 2017) Foreign Exchange Market Commentary (24 January 2017) Foreign Exchange Market Commentary (20 January 2017) Latest in Technical Analysis Jan 27 10:48 GMT - EUR/USD Reaches 1.0666 Mark Jan 27 10:47 GMT - GBP/USD To Slide Down Again Jan 27 10:45 GMT - USD/JPY Attempts To Reclaim 115.00 Jan 27 10:43 GMT - Gold Pause Above 1,180 Jan 27 09:57 GMT - S&P500 Nicely Turning Up Out O...

Equities traded higher in the morning and dipped beginning in the early afternoon, but the three major indexes have stayed in the green all day with about half an hour to go before the closing bell. WTI crude oil for February delivery settled at $52.42 a barrel, up about 2% on the day for a weekly gain of 0.1%. February gold added 0.3% on the day to settle at $1,204.90. Equities were headed for a higher close close shortly before the bell as the DJIA traded up 0.41% for the day, the S&P 500 traded up 0.23%, and the Nasdaq Composite traded up 0.15%. The DJIA stock posting the largest daily percentage gain ahead of the close Friday was Merck & Co. Inc. (NYSE: MRK) which traded up 3.90% at $62.68. The stock’s 52-week range is $47.97 to $65.46. Volume was about 70% higher than the daily average of around 11.2 million shares. The company had no specific news Friday, but rival Bristol-Myers said this morning that it would not see accelerated approval for its lung cancer drug and that leaves Merck in the driver’s seat. The Procter & Gamble Co. (NYSE: PG) traded up 3.24% at $87.44. The stock’s 52-week range is $76.55 to $90.33. Volume was about double the daily average of around 9.3 million shares. The company reported good second-quarter sales growth and raised its fiscal year forecast. International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE: IBM) traded up 1.97% at $170.10. The stock’s 52-week range is $116.90 to $170.62, a new 52-week high posted today. Volume was nearly 3 times the daily average of around 3.5 million shares. The company had no specific news. Exxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE: XOM) traded up about 1.23% at $85.77. The stock’s 52-week range is $73.55 to $95.55. Volume was about 15% above the daily average of around 11.1 million shares. The company had no specific news Friday. Of the Dow 30 stocks, 18 are on track to close higher Friday and 12 are set to close lower.

People who favor investing in a way that helps preserve the environment have more options than strictly focusing on companies that offer Earth-friendly products or services. Funk spoke with The Associated Press on the fund’s broader approach to environmentally sustainable investing. (Photo: David Fox Photographer, AP) People who favor investing in a way that helps preserve the environment have more options than strictly focusing on companies that offer Earth-friendly products or services. Companies that make solar energy panels, electric vehicles or household products sourced from sustainable materials may fit the bill, but not necessarily offer attractive returns. Brown Advisory Funds' Sustainable Growth Fund (BIAWX) keeps this in mind. It focuses on companies that are growing even as they use environmentally sustainable practices in their business or offer a service or product that helps other companies do the same. That means the fund has lots of big-name companies that one wouldn't immediately think of as having a green or environmentally friendly focus, such as Amazon.com, UnitedHealth, Facebook and Visa. The fund lagged its benchmark index last year, the Russell 1000 Growth index, but its annualized returns have been nearly identical to the index since its inception in 2012. Karina Funk, co-portfolio manager of the fund, weighs in on how the fund is expanding the definition of environmentally conscious investing. Answers have been edited for length and clarity: Q: Explain what you look for when selecting companies for the fund. A: The way to make money on companies that have sustainability characteristics is to start with fundamentally strong companies. A green or sustainability thesis is not a silver bullet for automatically making money or losing money. So there are three primary characteristics that we require in our portfolio companies: They must be fundamentally strong. They must have sustainable advantages. And we also must buy them at attractive valuations. USA TODAY 5 best industries for starting a business in 2017 With these criteria, we believe we find the management teams that are making the right investments in their own long-term sustainability, in their own economic self-interest, so they can compete and continue to be a part of our everyday lives for decades to come, and that is in line with our long-term investment approach. For us, sustainability is a means and not an end in and of itself. Our end goal is to invest in companies that will outperform the broad market. And one of our means of doing this is to find fundamentally strong companies that are using sustainability strategies to add value for shareholders. Q: How do you gauge whether a company's investments in sustainable business practices make it a good fit for your fund? A: We need to see evidence of sustainability adding value in very specific ways, either through stronger revenue growth and improved cost structure, which improves margins, or increased customer loyalty, or what we call enhanced franchise value. In terms of growing revenues faster, this could be by offering a product or service that helps customers reduce their cost of doing business by reducing or eliminating certain materials or equipment, saving on energy, saving on chemicals, water, inputs or outputs. In short, it's about helping to drive productivity and efficiency for their customers and saving them money. USA TODAY 5 facts you didn't know about dividends Q: What's a good example of a company whose product or service fits this bill? A: A.O. Smith. They make the highest efficiency water heaters on the market and for really high volume use cases, like hotels or hospitals, you can get a payback on energy savings alone in less than three years, and that's really compelling for high-volume water users. So that's an example of a product or service that has a compelling growth driver, because they improve productivity or efficiency for the end customers. Q: Is it more important that a company is making an environmentally-friendly product versus, say, just operating in a way that makes their business more sustainable? A: We truly believe you can find sustainability drivers in just about every sector of the economy, but they're not easy to find. When you look at our holdings it looks like a large-cap growth fund, but I can tell you that it's a large-cap growth fund where we avail ourselves of information that most money managers miss. Amazon is our top holding. It's companies like Amazon that are important sustainability investments in ways that move the needle on environmental and sustainability profiles in more significant ways than some smaller companies. USA TODAY Four reasons why P&G doesn't have analysts in a lather They can leverage (their) IT system for thousands of customers external to them and provide computational resources in real time that have literally eliminated the needs of many companies to build up their own data servers and storage and computational capabilities. So that is significant in terms of reducing hardware, software and energy usage. It's not like there's some database out there that tells us that Amazon is green. We're willing to invest in these strong sustainability drivers before it might be recognized by the market. So, when you look at our portfolio, there's a strong sustainability driver for every single one of those, even though they may not be in your usual suspect, green sectors like renewable energy. In a nutshell, we're looking for fundamentally strong companies that are outperforming in part of, not despite, their sustainability strategies. 5 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2jNivcq NEVER MISS OUT Managing Your Money Master your money with the latest business and investment news, articles and tips from financial experts each Friday.

The Philippine Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has filed an administrative case against French pharmaceutical giant Sanofi Pasteur Inc. for violating Administrative Order 65 s. 1989 by airing television and radio advertisements of its dengue vaccine, Dengvaxia.   The said administrative order prohibits the advertisement, in any form, of prescription or ethical drug. On the basis of this, Sanofi has been issued a Summons with Cease and Desist Order by the FDA last December for airing the subject advertisement. The FDA Legal Service will hear the case   in accordance with the quasi-judicial powers of the FDA under Republic Act 9711 or the Food and Drug Administration Act of 2009. FDA director general Nela Charade Puno pointed out that when FDA files an administrative case against an entity like Sanofi, it has the power to suspend, revoke or cancel the License to Operate of the company or the Certificate of Product Registration of the product itself. Last year, the FDA’s Center for Drug Regulation and Research has monitored the airing of the advertising materials on dengue vaccination. It has also reported the unauthorized promotion of dengue vaccine in the malls. In the Summons issued by FDA last Dec. 13, 2016, Sanofi was directed to cease and desist from disseminating advertisements for Dengvaxia in any form of mass or social media. Sanofi was also directed to stop activities promoting and marketing the vaccine in malls. “Even if they have stopped airing their advertisements, they can still face administrative sanctions for violating the law in the first place,” Puno said.  “We appreciate the support and cooperation of the broadcast institutions in complying with FDA’s request not to air unauthorized advertisements.  Let this be a message to other pharmaceutical companies as well. The FDA is serious in enforcing its mandate to ensure that the public is provided only with the correct information on the food, drugs, cosmetics and health devices that they use,” Puno warned.   Published in Business Tweet Latest from Tribune Wires Matobato charged for kidnap of claimed terrorist Makdum BI’s Morente scored by DU30’s supporters for order to stop campaign vs illegal aliens Funeral home owner yields, vows to ‘tell all’ in Jee slay 8 of 10 Pinoys want RP to assert rights on S.

RedEye Get can't-miss events, buzz on top bars & the hottest restaurants delivered to your inbox Business On Inauguration Day, stocks edge higher, snapping a 5-day losing streak for Dow The presidential inauguration of Donald Trump. Tribune news servicesContact Reporter Materials companies led U.S. stocks modestly higher Friday, recouping much of the market's loss from a day earlier and snapping a 5-day losing streak for the Dow Jones industrial average. Another crop of encouraging company earnings news helped lift the market, but investors were mostly focused on events in Washington as Donald Trump was sworn in as the 45th president of the United States. The major stock indexes pulled back slightly as Trump delivered remarks after taking the oath of office. Among topics of particular interest to Wall Street, the speech touched on trade and the Trump administration's intention of protecting the U.S. from "the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies, and destroying our jobs." "The market is still embracing the Trump agenda, based on the market's reaction to the speech," said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial. "Now the question the market has is, specifically, what does all of that mean in terms of trade?" The Dow rose 94.85 points, or 0.5 percent, to 19,827.25. The Standard & Poor's 500 index gained 7.62 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,271.31. The Nasdaq composite index added 15.25 points, or 0.3 percent, to 5,555.33. Despite Friday's gains, the three major stock indexes ended the week lower. Stocks have slowed in 2017 after surging for several weeks following Election Day on investor optimism that a Trump administration and Republican Congress would usher in business-friendly policies. But the possibility of increased tariffs or trade restrictions has also loomed as a potential drag in profits for big U.S. companies. Live blog: Inauguration of Donald J.

Going back to 1928, the S&P has averaged a drop of 1.05 percent on inauguration days, according Bespoke Investment Group. Beyond the presidential transition in Washington, investors pored over the latest batch of corporate earnings Friday, bidding up shares in companies that reported results that beat Wall Street's expectations.

Traders also drove up shares in Procter & Gamble after the consumer goods maker released a strong growth forecast. The stock added $2.75, or 3.2 percent, to $87.45. Strong subscriber numbers helped lift AT&T, giving a boost to phone company stocks overall. AT&T added 45 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $41.45. Some companies' earnings failed to impress the market. General Electric slid 2.2 percent after the conglomerate reported fourth-quarter revenue that fell short of analysts' forecasts. The stock gave up 68 cents to $30.53. Investors sold off Bristol-Myers Squibb after the drugmaker said it won't pursue accelerated regulatory approval for a two-drug lung cancer treatment. The stock was the biggest decliner in the S&P 500 index, shedding $6.26, or 11.3 percent, to $49.23. Major stock indexes overseas were mixed Friday. Germany's DAX rose 0.3 percent, while Britain's FTSE 100 fell 0.1 percent. France's CAC 40 added 0.2 percent. In Asia, Hong Kong's Hang Seng shed 0.7 percent after the Chinese government said the economy grew at a 6.8 percent annual rate in the last quarter, even as full-year growth increased 6.7 percent, the weakest in three decades. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index rose 0.3 percent. Benchmark U.S. crude rose $1.05, or 2 percent, to close at $52.42 a barrel in New York.

The Minneapolis-based retailer also will become an Official Partner of Major League Soccer (MLS) after striking a multi-year deal that includes airtime during broadcasts on ESPN, FOX Sports and Univision. In addition, the company said in a statement that there would be "opportunities for in-stadium experiences, player appearances and ownership of certain major MLS platforms" that will be unveiled later. "There are so many things that drew us to soccer – it's multicultural, watched and played by families and is growing immensely in popularity," commented Rick Gomez, SVP of Marketing at Target. "We've partnered with several incredible organizations and vendors to invite soccer fans everywhere to engage with the Target brand in new ways," he added. Gomez went on to tell Fortune that the popularity of soccer is increasing across demographic groups in the US, especially among Hispanics, and that sales of soccer-related items at Target stores rose 15% last year. "We are always looking for new, innovative ways to connect and drive relevancy with our guests and we think soccer is a platform that can enable us to do just that," he said. "Soccer is incredibly popular with Hispanics and Hispanics represent a key demographic for Target." The company added that it would become the Official Retailer of US Youth Soccer, which features more than 3m players between the ages of five and 19, as well as 900,000 coaches, volunteers and administrators. In addition, Target will be the presenting sponsor of the Target United Cup, which it says is the largest recreational soccer tournament in the US. Target has further plans to engage many of its leading vendors in its soccer marketing initiative, including Procter & Gamble's Gillette and Tide brands, as well as Kimberly-Clark, Philips and others. "We see this as a platform that could help us build connections with our guests, build love for our brand and at the same time drive traffic into our stores," Gomez said.
