Unlike newspaper or television ads, online advertising can be aimed precisely at the very people a company wants to reach, so businesses won’t waste money by showing ads to those consumers outside predetermined parameters.

AI Is Making It Very Hard to Know An Ostrich-Like Robot Pushes the Limits of Legged Locomotion The 3-D Printer That Could Finally Change Manufacturing Then last year Procter & Gamble’s chief marketing officer, Marc Pritchard, declared that the company would pull back on ad targeting on Facebook. One of a number of recent announcements by Pritchard regarding P&G’s dissatisfaction with digital advertising, the news led some to question the value of digital advertising’s distinguishing characteristic: its capacity to target narrow segments of the population. P&G’s reëvaluation of its approach is part of a trend that appears to be growing among advertisers, says Tim Riordan, special operations consultant at Adobe Advertising Cloud, a platform that helps advertisers manage ad strategy and measurement (see “The End of Internet Advertising as We Know It”). The movement has yet to show up in the overall numbers, however, as digital ad spending continues to climb. Research firm eMarketer predicts that U.S. digital ad spending will experience double-digit growth from $83 billion this year, or about 40 percent of the overall projected $206 billion that will be spent on all advertising in 2017, to more than $129 billion in 2021. Typically, the more targeted the ads, the higher the prices. The types of digital targeting that can boost ad prices vary widely. Targeting allows businesses not just to advertise a pair of shoes or an SUV someone just looked at online but to aim ads based on geographic, demographic, and psychographic data (see “Has Big Data Made Anonymity Impossible?”). Or audience targets can be narrowed based on data from a wide variety of providers, such as information about previous purchases or about the current weather in a consumer’s location. But how effectively does that information work to meet advertiser goals? As advertisers including P&G, which spends billions of dollars each year on all its advertising for brands including Crest, Old Spice, and Gillette, have tried to assess the effectiveness of their increasing digital ad budgets, they’ve discovered that hyper-targeting consumers doesn’t always work. When a beer brand wanted to hit a thin slice of the male audience, calorie-conscious men aged 21 to 27, Adobe tested the tactic and showed the client that perhaps it was looking through the wrong goggles to gauge success. By making its ad campaign less targeted, the brand lowered the cost of each ad impression and in the end sold more beer. Opening the target audience to a wider 21-to-34-year-old range led new households to purchase the product, Riordan says.

When aiming ads for its fitness apparel at the 18-to-24-year-old men who wore it, one advertiser realized it was “mothers and wives buying for their sons and husbands” who were really driving the sales, says Ric Elert, president of Conversant Media, a digital ad firm whose roots are in direct or personalized digital marketing. “The answer is not whether you should do refined targeting or not. Of course you should do refined targeting,” says Irwin Gotlieb, chairman of GroupM Global, the media agency that controls the largest chunk of the world’s ad spending, which works with P&G in international markets and its competitor Unilever overseas and in the U.S. The mistake companies have made, he says, is to rely too much on targeted advertising, cutting too far back on broader advertising that builds brand awareness with people outside the existing customer base and eventually leads to new sales. A heavy emphasis on targeting can sometimes improve a company’s return on its advertising investment in the short term, says Gotlieb, but lead to a loss in market share over time. Rather than a referendum on all digital targeting, pronouncements by companies like P&G may be a sign of maturity in the online advertising market as it assesses what this strategy can do very well and what it cannot.

P&G is spreading out duties on its digital-media-buying operation after seven years with AudienceScience. Rival Unilever has struck shorter contracts with marketing-tech vendors because of rapid change. Credit: P&G Most Popular Procter & Gamble, the world's biggest advertiser, is breaking up duties for its seven-year-old Hawkeye programmatic digital-media-buying operation as it looks to save at least $1 billion annually on media spending and $500 million more from agency and production fees globally over five years. The move also comes as Chief Brand Officer Marc Pritchard is pressing to reform the digital-media supply chain through a series of provocative speeches to industry groups. The changes to P&G's programmatic buying operation include parting ways with the original tech provider, AudienceScience, in favor of different providers in various parts of the world such as Neustar and The Trade Desk. P&G does look to programmatic to make better use of media dollars, said P&G spokeswoman Tressie Rose. But she described the move as more about customizing for regional needs. "There's a lot going on in this space," she said. "We decided it was time to add what's needed for local and regional flexibility." Related Stories P&G Will Cut $2 Billion in Marketing but Spend Some Back to Become 'Irresistible' P&G's Pritchard Blasts Objections to His Digital Demands as 'Head Fakes' As Marketers Take Control of Ad Tech, Complexity Follows P&G's contract with AudienceScience, which provided an integrated global data-management platform (DMP) and demand-side platform (DSP), expires at the end of P&G's fiscal year on June 30, Rose said. P&G will work with Neustar and The Trade Desk in North America "and multiple parts of the world," she said. Neustar is expected to provide the DMP, with The Trade Desk providing the DSP, according to people familiar with the matter. There will be a variety of partners for P&G around the world, "especially on the buying end," meaning DSPs, Rose said. "Some of them have yet to be determined." The moves don't affect relationships with agencies that work with P&G including Omnicom's Hearts & Science and Dentsu Aegis Network's Carat in North America, Rose said. P&G began developing Hawkeye in 2008 and engaged AudienceScience in 2010 to provide its tech backbone, creating perhaps the first -- and certainly among the first -- single-client programmatic operations of its kind, said Tim Barnes, chief product officer at AudienceScence. "I think this is the longest-standing direct-to-client relationship in the industry," he said. Hawkeye has allowed P&G to separate its buying from that of competitors or others and have greater visibility into how transactions are done. It is often described as "in-house," but inasmuch as AudienceScience provided the backbone and owned much of the intellectual property and data, that doesn't fully describe things. The actual hardware involved, for example, is largely in Cincinnati or other P&G facilities, with P&G, agency and AudienceScience people working with it there and remotely. However it's described, bypassing agencies as ad-tech owners and operators never sat well with everyone. WPP CEO Martin Sorrell, whose holding company lost potential revenue from the trend, said companies that go "in house" have trouble attracting necessary talent and keeping up with technology. Unilever executives, who work with WPP's Mindshare on its Ultra programmatic buying system, have stated a preference to have marketing-tech contracts run no more than a year because of rapid change, and Barnes said many client arrangements with DSPs such as The Trade Desk last only 90 days at a time. But in an interview, Barnes made the case for an integrated global buying platform for a company like P&G to take full advantage of its scale and deliver consistent results from the U.S. to China, where, for example, he said some tech firms operate from the outside in Hong Kong but AudienceScience operates inside "The Great Firewall." Barnes didn't rule out continuing to work with P&G in some parts of the world or that AudienceScience may play a transitional role beyond June 30. Just as P&G's global programmatic platform was unprecedented, so is unwinding the deal, he said. "This is a little bit of uncharted territory for the industry, let alone AudienceScience," Barnes said. "The contract is very clear. We own the intellectual property. We own our own [data] space. P&G owns their own first-party data obviously, and that's carved out into a P&G data warehouse." He said there's a transition plan to give P&G continuity, "and we plan to be a partner in that effort." Losing the world's biggest advertiser as a client is a blow, Barnes acknowledged, but one cushioned by continued rapid growth in programmatic media buying. And he said he's proud of the work AudienceScience has been part of. "In their marketing-mix modeling, where we are held up against all of their other advertising channels, we have been their number-one channel four years running," he said. P&G's Rose confirmed that Hawkeye "has been very effective" under AudienceScience, but declined to confirm the "number one" designation.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: 10 Companies That Have Paid Dividends for More Than 120 Years Pick dividend stocks you can rely on. Dan Caplinger (TMFGalagan) May 4, 2017 at 6:00AM Image source: Getty Images. Investors rely on dividend stocks for the income they need, and that makes it critically important to choose companies that have a track record of paying dividends through good times and bad. Out of the thousands of stocks on the market, only a handful of companies have stood the test of time by delivering dividends to shareholders for more than 120 years. Below, we'll look at 10 dividend stocks that pass the test so you can decide whether they belong in your portfolio. Image source: Johnson Controls. 1. Johnson Controls Johnson Controls (NYSE:JCI) is well known for its heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems, as well as its security and energy-management services. The company also has a business division that supplies batteries to the automotive market. Johnson Controls' industrial business is vulnerable to the ups and downs of economic cycles, but it has done a good job of sustaining dividends: It has made consecutive payouts dating back to 1887. Johnson Controls' stock currently sports a dividend yield of 2.3%. Dividend growth has also been an important part of the company's history. It has increased its dividend in 36 of the past 38 years, having given investors substantial raises in many of the past several years, and it looks poised to keep sharing its success with its shareholders. Image source: Stanley Black & Decker. 2. Stanley Black & Decker Stanley Black & Decker (NYSE:SWK) is a giant in the power tools business, with the formerly independent Stanley Works and Black & Decker companies coming together several years ago and joining forces. In addition to its tools, the company also provides security systems, fastening products, welding equipment, and a variety of hand tools. Stanley Black & Decker has a dividend history that dates back to 1877. Stanley Black & Decker's current dividend yield of 1.7% isn't all that high. But the company boasts a 49-year track record of dividend increases each and every year, including its most recent boost of more than 5%. Going forward, the need for basic tools should keep Stanley Black & Decker moving higher even in challenging economic environments. Image source: Getty Images. 3. ExxonMobil ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) needs no introduction. The oil giant is a powerhouse in the global energy industry, and its integrated oil and natural gas business is the benchmark against which smaller oil companies measure themselves. With a history that goes back to Standard Oil, ExxonMobil and its predecessors have paid dividends since 1882. ExxonMobil has a healthy dividend yield of 3.8%, and it also has a history of annual dividend increase that goes back 35 years. As long as you keep gassing up your car or heating your home, demand for ExxonMobil's products will continue, and that should help power dividend raises for years to come. Image source: Eli Lilly. 4. Eli Lilly Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) makes medications that millions of people need to get and stay healthy. Lilly has a huge stable of lucrative prescription drugs to drive sales and profits, with products like antidepressant Cymbalta and schizophrenia and bipolar disorder treatment Zyprexa leading the way. The company has passed that success on to its shareholders by paying a dividend since 1885. Lilly's dividend yield of 2.5% is solid, but the company doesn't have a long streak of annual dividend increases. After more than 40 years of consecutive boosts, Lilly kept its dividend flat in the aftermath of the 2008-2009 financial crisis. For now, Lilly has focused on making the most of its drug opportunities, and investors are sharing the bounty. Image source: Consolidated Edison. 5. Consolidated Edison Utilities are traditionally great dividend stocks, and Consolidated Edison (NYSE:ED) has been especially strong. As the primary regulated utility for New York City and the surrounding area, the company serves about 3.4 million electric customers and 1.1 million natural-gas customers in the city and in Westchester County, with additional customers in outlying areas. The utility has paid dividends since 1885. Consolidated Edison's current dividend yield is 3.5%, which is well above the market's average, and the company also boasts a 43-year streak of consecutive dividend increases. Boring businesses can be beautiful for shareholders, and Consolidated Edison shows that the right combination of fundamental strength and regular income can make for an invaluable addition to your portfolio. Image source: UGI. 6. UGI Along the same lines, UGI (NYSE:UGI) is a distributor of electricity, natural gas, and propane. The company doesn't have the brand awareness of Consolidated Edison, but it serves nearly 2 million residential and commercial propane customers throughout the 50 states. Its distribution network and retail sales services help customers directly, while its electricity generation facilities supply power well beyond its home market of Pennsylvania. The company's dividend history started in 1885. UGI's current dividend yield is 2%, but it has a 30-year track record of boosting its payments every year. Moreover, the company has ample earnings to finance its dividends, which gives it plenty of room for potential increases down the road. Image source: Procter & Gamble. 7. Procter & Gamble Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) is a household name around the world, with roughly two dozen different brands producing at least $1 billion in sales annually. From Tide detergent to Pampers diapers and Crest toothpaste, you can find Procter & Gamble products in nearly every medicine cabinet and laundry room in the U.S., as well as in many countries across the globe. The company has paid its shareholders dividends since 1891. Procter & Gamble pays a 3.2% dividend yield, and its streak of regular payout increases is one of the longest in the stock market at 61 years and counting. The Dow Jones component's market exposure is unparalleled, and as developing economies gain purchasing power, they should help boost P&G's growth in the long run. Image source: Coca-Cola. 8. Coca-Cola Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) is an American icon whose simple soft drinks have turned into a consumer-products monolith. Even as the company has had to deal with threats to its dominance, including restrictions and taxes on sugary soft drinks, Coca-Cola has managed to weather these worldwide trends and come out with new products to make up lost ground. Coca-Cola's dividend record stretches back to 1893. Coca-Cola boasts a 3.5% dividend yield and a 55-year track record of annual dividend increases. Some investors fear for the future of its business, but Coca-Cola has changed gears enough times in its history that it should be able to overcome its current challenges and maintain its dominance over the beverage market. Image source: Colgate-Palmolive. 9. Colgate-Palmolive Like Procter & Gamble, Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL) has ridden the global rise of the consumer class by selling everyday people the everyday products they need. Its many brands of household consumables, like Colgate toothpaste and Palmolive dish detergent, have achieved near-ubiquity -- and raked in huge profits. The company has been generous in sharing those profits with others, having paid dividends since 1895. Colgate-Palmolive's stock yields just 2.2%, but it has a 54-year dividend streak. If its emerging-market sales continue to accelerate, then Colgate-Palmolive should be in an ideal position to keep making shareholders richer. Clock tower in York, Pennsylvania. Image source: Getty Images. 10. York Water Few investors have heard of York Water (NASDAQ:YORW), but the water utility specialist serves its customers in Pennsylvania with high-quality water and wastewater services. York serves a wide variety of different types of residential and commercial customers, helping to spur greater industrial activity. Its history of dividend payments goes back more than 200 years. Right now, York Water yields just 1.7%. But the company has increased its payout for 20 straight years, and some investors believe future consolidation in the water utility business could help York Water find partners and grow even bigger and more financially healthy. People will always need water, and this utility has what it takes to succeed. Strong stocks with lucrative dividends are valuable, and the best dividend stocks keep paying dividends through thick and thin. For investors who appreciate a good track record, these stocks are worth a closer look for your dividend portfolio. Dan Caplinger has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 4 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Mark Meili, Director of Modeling & Simulation at Procter & Gamble, to Keynote at CIMdata’s Product & Manufacturing Innovation Workshop Mark Meili, Director of Modeling & Simulation at Procter & Gamble, to Keynote at CIMdata’s Product & Manufacturing Innovation Workshop The presentation will consider the technical skills and capabilities required to change the way in which we work. Ann Arbor, MI, May 04, 2017 –(PR.com)– CIMdata, Inc., the leading global PLM strategic management consulting and research firm, announces that Mr. Mark Meili, Director of Modeling and Simulation at Procter & Gamble, will make a keynote presentation at the upcoming Product & Manufacturing Innovation Driven by Digital Design & Simulation Workshop. The workshop will take place at the UI LABS Innovation Center, home to DMDII, in Chicago, Illinois, on June 6 and 7. In-silico is a term that describes science done on a computer as opposed to the more traditional in-vivo or physically-based experimentation. Innovation is being, and will increasingly be, driven by a combination of simulation and data analytics. The quality and quantity of engineering and science that can already be done using simulation is simply amazing. The scope, however, is not well understood by many technical leaders, much less their business partners. As systems continue to increase in complexity, physical prototypes of the entire systems are too expensive and time consuming to use for most technical learning. Purposeful interventions in systems understanding and simulation are needed. In his keynote address, “Simulation Led Innovation – The promise, the pitfalls, and business imperative for ever better products and business execution,” Mr. Meili will talk about the technical skills and capabilities required to change the way we work. He will also discuss the need for this way of working to be a stated business strategy in order to be successful. CIMdata’s Product & Manufacturing Innovation Driven by Digital Design & Simulation Workshop, is the must-attend event for industrial organizations and solution providers interested in learning more about model-driven engineering strategies and the solutions that will enable on-going product and manufacturing innovation to create competitive advantage, minimize total lifecycle costs, and drive top-line revenue growth. It will provide attendees with independent experiences from industrial companies and a collaborative networking environment where ideas, trends, experiences, and critical relationships germinate and take root. CIMdata’s thought-leadership team of Don Tolle, Dr. Keith Meintjes, Dr. Ken Versprille, Dr. Suna Polat, and Frank Popielas, will be on hand in Chicago to facilitate the workshop and associated discussions.

It’s all at issue as Donald Trump’s point woman on American education speaks to HBCU grads. BY THE FLORIDA COURIER STAFF In Daytona Beach, the home of Bethune-Cookman University, protesters marched down Dr. Mary McLeod Bethune Boulevard, where the school is located, on Wednesday. (DUANE C. FERNANDEZ SR. / HARDNOTTSPHOTOGRAPHY.COM) DAYTONA BEACH – After days of rumors circulating among Bethune-Cookman University (B-CU) alumni and students that prominent school choice advocate and current U.S. Department of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos would be the Class of 2017’s commencement speaker on May 10, confirmation of DeVos’s appearance quickly spiraled into a political battle that attracted national media attention. DeVos has been harshly criticized among advocates of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) as a consequence of a press statement she issued during this year’s Black History Month observance in February. The statement read, in part, “…we must be willing to make the tangible, structural reforms that will allow students to reach their full potential. HBCUs…started from the fact that there were too many students in America who did not have equal access to education… “HBCUs are real pioneers when it comes to school choice. They are living proof that when more options are provided to students, they are afforded greater access and greater quality.” No historical context Her Feb. 28 statement didn’t mention that HBCUs originated as a response to a racist American system of higher education that, with few exceptions, refused to admit African-Americans to predominately White colleges and universities for almost 200 years of the nation’s history. Backlash followed soon after DeVos’s statement with many accusing her of ignoring and distorting America’s history of educational racism in a way that supports her advocacy for school voucher programs that take money away from public schools. Last week, the Florida Courier sent an email requesting that B-CU confirm or deny that DeVos would speak at commencement, but got no response. Once the rumor was mentioned online at Politico.com on April 30, B-CU President Edison Jackson confirmed that DeVos would speak in a May 1 “Message from the President.” The Department of Education officially announced the speech soon thereafter. Won’t shelter students “As a veteran educator, I am especially sensitive to balancing the notion of academic freedom with quelling potentially hateful and harmful rhetoric,” Jackson stated. “I am of the belief that it does not benefit our students to suppress voices that we disagree with, or to limit students to only those perspectives that are broadly sanctioned by a specific community. “When we seek to shelter our students and campus communities from views that are diametrically opposed to their own, we actually leave our students far less capable of combating those ideas.  Additionally, the sheer diversity of our human family requires us to listen to and understand one another.  We cannot, and we will not, ever accomplish this if we continue to exist in ideological, social, and racial silos.” Jackson went on to put the DeVos commencement speech in the context of actions taken by the school’s founder, Dr. Mary McLeod Bethune, to solicit support from oil barons John D. Rockefeller and Henry Flagler and James Proctor of the Proctor and Gamble company, among others. “These individuals represented diverse political and social views, but Dr. Bethune invited them all to visit and support her institution.  It is in that same vein that I have chosen to provide our students with an opportunity to hear from someone with whom they may disagree, but someone who has the ability to potentially influence their future,” Jackson explained. Blistering NAACP response Citing what it called DeVos’s “horrible public education record impacting Blacks and minorities in Florida and around the country,” the Florida State Conference of NAACP Branches responded to Jackson’s confirmation by asking DeVos to decline B-CU’s invitation to speak. “We believe the leadership of Bethune-Cookman University should not bestow an honorary degree to Secretary DeVos based on her post-secondary education record,” said state president Adora Obi Nweze, calling B-CU’s actions “unusual.” “Their plan (is) to honor a person who has been on the job less than one hundred days and has no record of advancing educational equity for all students… If Secretary DeVos ultimately speaks at commencement and receives an honorary degree, this would be a slap in the face to minorities, women and all communities of color,” Nweze exclaimed. Proxy war? The B-CU controversy laid bare the two sides battling for the direction of, and the dollars invested in, the American educational system. Republicans like DeVos – a billionaire GOP donor who has financially supported charter school and voucher advocates, including Black churches in Florida that run Christian charter schools – are generally on one side of the educational argument. The NAACP, teachers’ unions, and Democrats are on the other. Jackson is a registered Republican. DeVos is also scheduled to appear at a B-CU-hosted prayer breakfast at the Orlando’s Amway Center the day after commencement. Her father-in-law, Rich DeVos, founded the Amway Corporation and owns the Orlando Magic, the city’s National Basketball Association team. Dueling online petitions As of late Wednesday night, the Florida Courier’s press time, more than 5,500 people had signed an online petition, written and posted April 29 by B-CU alumnus Dominick Whitehead, to stop DeVos from speaking. “Last month DeVos weakened consumer protection for student loan borrowers. According to U.S. News & World Report, 97 percent of full-time undergraduates who attend BCU receive some sort of need-based financial aid,” Whitehead writes. “…(T)he median earning of a graduate from B-CU is approximate $22,000 per year for the first two years after graduating. This would make it virtually impossible to immediately begin to pay off an estimated $52,000 in student loan debt. “President Barack Obama’s administration offered income-based repayment plans and student loan forgiveness programs. DeVos’ April 11th memo threatens to dismantle those very helpful programs. This means that lenders will not have any restrictions while attempting to collect the money that was borrowed by students.” ‘Meaningful dialogue’ Instead of having DeVos speak at graduation, “let’s welcome her to the table and have meaningful dialogue about stronger policies, the White House HBCU Initiative, and the importance and contributions of HBCUs,” Whitehead suggests. A separate Change.org petition – posted by Nzhada Harris on May 1, the same day as Jackson’s ‘Message’ was distributed – supports DeVos’s appearance. “Education is a non-partisan issue that every individual should have the right to obtain,” the petition states. As of Wednesday night, it had 69 supporters. A student speaks Shavona Bouey, a senior mass communications major in B-CU’s 2017 graduating class, spoke exclusively to the Florida Courier. “As you can imagine, it’s been pretty chaotic for myself and other students to fully understand why Mrs. DeVos is being welcomed as the spring commencement speaker. Students even held a protest against Mrs. DeVos,” she asserted. “My mother and other family members don’t support the things Mrs. DeVos says and neither do I. HBCUs were created by force. African-Americans had no other options, or choice, I shall say. DeVos clearly forgot about slavery and Jim Crow laws, among other things. “Why does someone who speaks so unethically about HBCUs be given the opportunity to speak at one? I’ve yet to come up with an answer,” she lamented. Happened before It’s not the first time the university’s leadership has been criticized for honoring a prominent Republican leader. Last fall, B-CU’s administration caught flak for weeks from supporters over the decision to give Florida Gov. Rick Scott the university’s most prestigious award, citing what they allege is Scott’s long record of anti-Black initiatives – including cuts to HBCU funding – as reasons he wasn’t qualified to receive it. Vocal opposition against Scott receiving the award named after B-CU’s founder included a statewide letter-writing campaign, an online petition that garnered about 800 signatures, and an outcry of injustice lodged by the state and Volusia County-Daytona Beach leaders of the NAACP.

As good bull markets should, the market has climbed a skeptical “wall of worry.” That’s encouraging, as history has repeatedly shown that markets usually succumb in euphoric times when worries are not obvious. Momentum alone is likely to pull stocks further ahead as we move into the summer but there some cracks developing in the facade. A pause after a run of several months is normal, particularly with summer slowdowns lying ahead. The tempo is slowing, much like an Adagio following a spirited Allegro symphony movement. Investors should use this interval to tune their positions. Manufacturing and energy have gotten much media attention recently, cloaking possible weakness in the consumer sectors. Retail trade provides jobs for almost 16 million Americans, 11% of the total workforce. Hospitality jobs at restaurants and hotels are similar. These two groups thus comprise 22% of the total workforce while the entire manufacturing sector employs around 12 million, only 9% of the workforce. Consumer confidence levels hit high levels after the elections but a lack of progress in Washington on economic issues is adding risk. Retail and food service sales levels were down in February and March. U.S. GDP growth in the March quarter was an anemic 0.7%, the lowest in three years. The Federal Reserve expressed concerns with this pace and voted this week to leave interest rates unchanged. It commented that it views the slowdown as “transitory” and its next meeting in June will bring sharply focused investor attention. Earnings reports are generally better than expected although market reactions have been inconsistent. Pepsi, Boeing, Proctor & Gamble and Texas Instruments all beat earnings estimates but their stock prices then slipped. Apple (AAPL-$146) briefly set a world record market capitalization of more than $776 billion, beat earning estimates and then disappointed Wall Street with iPhone sales of “only” 50.76 million against estimates of 52 million. Meanwhile, it boosted its dividend 10%, becoming the world’s largest dividend payer. It remains a buy and the largest position in my client portfolios. Auto sales slumped in April, the fourth straight month of sales not reaching expectations, signaling the auto market peaking after seven fat years. Although valuations are quite reasonable, negative trends have a way of getting worse and I sold our positions in General Motors and Magna. Ever developing geopolitical crises, will spur additional defense spending, an announced goal of the Administration. My new buys in the defense sector are General Dynamics (GD-$193) and Northrop Grumman (NOC-$244). GD joins previous buy Huntington Ingalls (HII-$185) with substantial shipbuilding and marine systems for the U.S. Navy. Its Gulfstream division is a leader in business jets and its aerospace sales are soaring. Northrop is also strong in Aerospace and is expanding its cyber security businesses into both government and commercial systems. It is a leading provider of unmanned aircraft, satellites and space systems. Both companies are trading at 19-20 times earnings with expected earnings growth in a 10%-14% range. Each yields around 1.5% with excellent records of consecutive dividend increases. Both companies beat estimates for first-quarter earnings and raised forecasts for full-year earnings. After stumbling through various uncertainties, the economies of Europe are stabilizing and a stable outcome to the French elections would help. Two pharmaceutical companies, Shire (SHPG-$180) and Novo-Nordisk (NVO-$41), beat earnings estimates and raised future guidance. Both previously suffered stock price setbacks, Shire from regulatory approval issues that blocked a merger and Novo from pressures on drug prices. Irish-based Shire (SHPG-$180) will earn around $15 this year, good growth at a very reasonable valuation. Novo’s earnings look flat this year in a $2.15-$2.25 range, heading to $2,40 next year. Stocks bottomed out after the Great Recession ended, a little more than          seven full years ago. That’s a timely signal for a “seventh-inning stretch” to tune stock portfolios, possibly to make some lineup changes. It is not a time for rookies.

Company Summary NSE BSE Hindustan UniLever Loading data... ADD TO PORTFOLIO ADD TO WATCHLIST SHARE YOUR OULOOK ChartsValuation & Peer ComparisonCommunity Buzz PEER COMPANIES Fast-moving consumer goods company Patanjali’s aim to outclass multinational rivals in the domestic market appears well on course, according to numbers disclosed by it on Thursday. The Baba Ramdev-led company clocked revenue of Rs 10,561 crore in FY17, making it the second-largest pure-play FMCG player after market leader Hindustan Unilever. What’s even more impressive is that Patanjali’s revenue put in the shade the combined sales of MNC giants Colgate-Palmolive, GSK Consumer Healthcare and P&G Hygiene and Healthcare. Ghee is the bestseller for Patanjali, contributing 14% to total revenues, followed by toothpaste (9%) and hair oil (8%). Its Divya pharmacy store contributed 8%. At Rs 825 crore, Patanjali’s hair oil sales are higher than that of key player Bajaj Corp. And adding a smile to Patanjali’s revenues are its toothpaste sales at Rs 940 crore, a segment where the home-bred player has captured 14% market share. Profits are galloping too, and have increased 100%, though actual numbers have not been disclosed yet. Also, it is unclear how much of the revenues have accrued from trading activities. The company aims to double revenues in the current fiscal year. From the looks of it, Patanjali may well do it, reports Kiran Kabtta Somvanshi.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 4 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Always Discreet® Launches Campaign with Walmart to Inspire Women with Bladder Leaks to Live Life Without Shame or Compromise CINCINNATI–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Embarrassed. Old. Frustrated. These negative feelings are just a few of the most common ways women describe how they feel about having bladder leaks. In order to help normalize the topic of bladder leaks, Always Discreet® is working with retailers to educate women nationwide. As an example, today, Procter & Gamble’s Always Discreet brand has worked with Walmart to launch a new, inspirational video to help women understand how common bladder leaks are and to rethink their negative feelings. Click here to watch the video and see the emotional responses women had when it came to talking about their bladder leaks: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySYOFGGAGo4 As the new, compelling video demonstrates, one out of three women over the age of 18 experience bladder leaks, but a new national survey from Always Discreet shows more than half (57 percent) of women who are 45 and older and experience bladder leaks are embarrassed to talk about it. The new survey also reveals that nearly half (48 percent) of these women currently do not to talk to anyone about their bladder leaks, including nearly a third (32 percent) of women who avoid talking about it even with their doctors. In fact, more than 60 percent of women would surprisingly rather talk about their weight or their political opinions. However, more than 70 percent of women agree that women would be more comfortable talking about bladder leaks if they knew that one in three women experience them too. Always Discreet, with Walmart, is on a mission to help women let go of the discouraging feelings they have about themselves, their bodies and incontinence by comforting and reassuring them that they’re not alone. “Because many women avoid talking about their bladder leaks, they can often feel alone in their experience, embarrassed to bring up the topic, and hesitant to shop for and wear incontinence products,” said Barbara Hannah Grufferman, positive living expert, author and Always Discreet spokesperson. “Over the years, I’ve spoken to thousands of women around the country who have bladder leaks, and most women don’t realize how common and normal it is. The good news is that once women realize how many other women experience it too, they feel better about it and themselves. That’s what’s been captured in this video, and the hope is that women watch it, make that connection for themselves and feel more confident, empowered and compelled to live their best lives and stand in solidarity with the many other women who experience bladder leaks too.” The new Always Discreet survey also revealed: Three-quarters of women (75 percent) are generally comfortable talking about almost anything with other women, but nearly three in five women say bladder leaks are embarrassing to talk about. Four in 10 women agree that bladder leaks are a taboo topic in our society. Over half (53 percent) of women who experience bladder leaks would be less embarrassed about their leaks if they knew one in three women have bladder leaks. Since 2014, Always Discreet has helped to increase the number of women using the right bladder protection from one in nine to one in seven. Through this new campaign, Always Discreet, with Walmart, continues to end the stigma surrounding bladder leaks and inspires women to not hold back, let their negative feelings go and live their best life with the right protection. For additional information on Always Discreet please visit www.alwaysdiscreet.com. Survey Methodology The Always Discreet Study was conducted by MSLGROUP Research and surveyed a total of 622 women aged 45 years or older who experience bladder leaks. The online survey was implemented between the dates of April 20, 2017 through April 25, 2017.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 4 May 2017 by Rahul Jadhav Global Organic And Natural Feminine Care Market 2017 To Expand At A Marvelous Cagr Of 7.09% to 2021 Summary Orbis Research Presents Global Organic and Natural Feminine Care Market 2017-2021 has been prepared based on an in-depth market analysis with inputs from industry experts. Description Recent Research Report – Global Organic and Natural Feminine Care Market 2017-2021 The Following Companies As The Key Players In The Global Organic And Natural Feminine Care Market: Bodywise, Corman, Maxim Hygiene, And The Honest Company. Other Prominent Vendors in the market are: Armada & Lady Anion, ALYK (LOLA), BON, COTTON HIGH TECH, Edgewell Personal Care, Wet & Dry Personal Care, First Quality Enterprises, GladRags, Kimberly-Clark, Lunapads, MedAltus, NutraMarks (Nutraceutical), NatraTouch, Bella Flor, Ontex, OI the Organic Initiative, P&G, Seventh Generation, Time of the Month, TOM ORGANIC, Unicharm, Veeda USA, and Vivanion. Commenting on the report, “One trend in market is increasing demand for natural and organic products. There has been an increasing demand for natural and organic feminine care products due to their skin friendly and environment friendly nature. These products are made of non-Genetically Modified (non-GMO) certified organic cotton, which is free from artificial dyes, rayon, and fragrances.” According to the report, one driver in market is growing awareness about hygiene and related products. Feminine hygiene care products such as menstrual pads, tampons, and pantyliners have been in the market for a longer period. But the awareness about the correct use of these products has been low. However, the rising advertisements and campaigns by vendors and governments worldwide, and growing educated population have helped to increase awareness about these products, the way of maintaining proper hygiene, and the correct way of disposal. For instance, The Great WASH Yatra (also known as Nirman Bharat Yatra in India) has been undertaken by the Water Supply and Sanitation Collaborative Council (WSSCC) in various countries to educate women about hygiene and convince them to replace the use of cloth menstrual pads with menstrual pads. This created a noteworthy influence on the demand for numerous feminine hygiene products, especially in emerging countries. Get a PDF Sample of Global Organic and Natural Feminine Care Market Research Report @: http://www.orbisresearch.com/contacts/request-sample/275695 Further, the report states that one challenges in market is presence of counterfeit products. Counterfeit products are one of the biggest challenges in the market. Since they are cheap and fake, they affect the brand image and profits of company with the original products. For instance, counterfeit pads contain harmful substances that cause uterine cancer to women. In the US, in 2014, many law enforcement authorities seized counterfeited products of the Always menstrual pads. These products were openly sold in many retail stores in New York, Pennsylvania, and Florida. Also, Asia is considered as the largest source for counterfeit products, with China as the single largest source economy. In 2013, in China, more than 19 million counterfeited menstrual pads of P&G and Unicharm were seized along with raw materials. Similar incidents have occurred in South Africa, Lebanon, and Vietnam. Stringent laws are required to prevent the manufacturing of these counterfeit products. The study was conducted using an objective combination of primary and secondary information including inputs from key participants in the industry. The report contains a comprehensive market and vendor landscape in addition to a SWOT analysis of the key vendors.

Ya Libnan Lebanon News and World News Live from Beirut Featured News Lebanon News World News Opinion Business News Arts & Culture Sci & Tech Video Apple’s cash pile of $250 billion fuels expectations April 30, 2017 by yalibnan 1 Comment In its quarterly results on Tuesday, Apple Inc. likely will report that its cash hoard has topped a quarter of a trillion dollars, an unrivaled milestone for a private corporation that raises a question: Why would any company want to hold that much money? Apple has added to its pile at a blistering pace, doubling it in just over four-and-a-half years. In the last three months of 2016 it wracked up new cash at a rate of about $3.6 million an hour. Its current total, not accounting for debt, exceeds the market values of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and that of Procter & Gamble Co., and outstrips the foreign-currency reserves of the U.K. and Canada combined. The stash has drawn fresh attention recently as President Donald Trump tries to revamp the U.S. tax regime. Apple, like many big companies, keeps most of its cash offshore — some 93% of its $246.09 billion total cash, cash equivalents, and securities as of December — to avoid U.S. corporate taxes that executives consider too high. The Trump administration this week proposed a one-time tax holiday to encourage companies to bring that cash home, and said it wants to slash the U.S. corporate-income-tax rate to 15% from 35% and largely exempt future foreign profits. That could make it easier for Apple to put its money to use, through acquisitions or by doling out more to shareholders. The latter prospect has propelled Apple’s stock to record highs. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook early this year said he was eager to bring cash home if tax changes enable it, and Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said such a move would give Apple flexibility to do more capital returns. Neither has given detailed plans. One possible approach would be a special dividend. Apple could deliver such a windfall, benefitting investors including Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc., which more than doubled its Apple position in January. Wall Street analysts tend to focus more on companies’ net cash position than the headline number. Apple has racked up some $88 billion in debt to fund payouts to shareholders. But even subtracting that, Apple would be left with more cash than the total stockpile of Microsoft, the next richest tech company, which boasts $126 billion in cash, not accounting for debt. With the exception of financial companies, Apple’s stash exceeds that of any other U.S. company in recent history, said Jennifer Blouin, an accounting professor at University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School. “I have never seen a company in this kind of extreme position, barring a winding-down,” she said. “Apple’s a cash box right now.” Former executives say Apple’s thrift has deep roots, inspired in part by a brush with bankruptcy in the late 1990s. That forced Chief Executive Steve Jobs to arrange a cash infusion from Microsoft Corp. and set his resolve to keep reserves for future emergencies. Mr. Jobs also believed Apple could better boost its stock price by using its money to develop new products than through buybacks or dividends. His biggest product, the iPhone, has only supercharged the cash machine. Apple has sold more than 1 billion of the devices in the decade since it was introduced, and today claims 91% of all the profits in the smartphone sector. Mr. Cook has been somewhat more accommodating of shareholder desires than his predecessor. He started a dividend-and-stock-buyback program in 2012 that has since sent more than $200 billion to shareholders. And he has invested more in some areas, such as R&D. But the CEO also stared down Carl Icahn in 2013 and 2014 when the activist investor bought a stake in Apple and demanded it increase buybacks. And Apple remains frugal in other realms, such as marketing. It spent less than $1.8 billion on advertising last year — not even half the amounts laid out by smaller rivals Alphabet Inc. and Amazon.com Inc., according to company filings. Apple also avoids large acquisitions. It bought at a rate of 15 to 20 companies a year over the past four years, generally spending several hundred million dollars on companies it can easily assimilate. Its biggest deal was the $3 billion it spent to buy Beats Electronics LLC in 2014. The swelling war chest has fueled hopes for bigger deals to vault Apple in new directions such as self-driving cars and entertainment. At Apple’s 2015 shareholder meeting, one investor asked Mr. Cook about buying Tesla Inc., which today is valued around $51 billion. The CEO didn’t directly respond. Robert Nichols of Windward Capital Management Co., an Apple shareholder, says it should buy Netflix Inc., valued around $65 billion, to jumpstart its video-streaming business and bolster its position against Amazon. “You can either build [content and distribution] or you can buy it,” and buying would help Apple gain ground where it is behind, he said. With $250 billion, Apple could buy both Tesla and Netflix and still have plenty left over. It also might want to use some cash to pay down some of its debt or look to boost U.S. manufacturing after facing calls last year from then-President-elect Trump to build a plant in the U.S. Either way, there is a growing sense that Apple’s cash hoard has far outstripped its needs. “If this a rainy day fund, they’re saving for a millennial flood,” said Lee Pinkowitz, a Georgetown University professor of finance.   FOX Filed Under: Business News vs Facebook tries to fix violent video problem with 3,000 new workers http://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-crime-idUSKBN17Z1N4 Featured News Trump: Middle East peace is ‘not as difficult as people have thought Trump, Australia’s Turnbull declared that they “get along great” Obama endorses French presidential candidate Macron Trump to Visit Saudi Arabia, Israel and Vatican, Meet With Pope Francis Lebanon News A man who sold his one year old daughter and buyer arrested in Lebanon Aoun, Hariri sign into law a bill that restores Lebanese citizenship to expats Lebanon speaker warns: No deal on an electoral law means “no country or institutions” Beirut to show the world in ‘Design Week’ that ‘Lebanon is not just about political instability’ World News Trump: ‘One of the best chemistries I had was with’ Merkel UK snap election: What does it mean?

That nostalgic slogan from Bata triggers flashbacks of school days and the white canvas shoes that children wore in decades past. The neighbourhood footwear brand is now modernising its image, moving with the times from old- school to cool. Rather than just dressing the feet of primary school students and mature shoppers, the staid Czech label, now 123 years old, is pumping a little swagger in its shoes. Think contemporary sneakers with floral embroidery, sleek high-heeled pumps in metallic rose gold and, for men, dapper hightop brown leather shoes with a wingtip pattern. The family-owned company staged its first fashion weekend in Prague two weeks ago to kick off its rejuvenation drive. The two-day showcase featured fashion shows, exhibits of its heritage products and live demonstrations of shoemaking techniques. In one show, the models changed their shoes on the runway, suggesting that flipping the footwear can totally transform a look. A model in a red power suit swopped her black stilettos for white sneakers with metallic details. This changed her powerful office look to a playful, sporty get-up. 5 things you may not know about Bata 1 Bata is a family business. The current chairman is Thomas G. Bata, grandson of founder Tomas Bata, who established the company 123 years ago. The chairman's son, Thomas A. Bata, is the brand's chief marketing officer. 2 The company was recognised in 2004 by Guinness World Records as the world's largest shoe manufacturer and retailer.  3 It has its own university. Named after the founder, Tomas Bata University was established in Zlin, Czech Republic, in 2001. There are six faculties offering programmes in technology, humanities and healthcare, for instance, up to the PhD level.  4 According to the brand, more than one million customers shop at Bata every day. It has more than 5,200 stores in more than 70 countries, including 42 in Singapore.  5 Bubblegummers, Bata's children's shoe line, has interesting name origins. According to chairman Thomas G. Bata, when the rubber shoes were first made, they smelt really bad. A Bata employee poured perfume on them to counter the stench. This resulted in a fruity bubblegum scent.

Geometric laser-cut sneaker, $39.95, available in Bata stores in mid-May. Brown leather wingtip highcut shoe from the Made In Italy collection, $189, in Bata stores next week. Navy blue leather sneaker with interwoven pattern from Bata’s Made In Italy collection, $139, in Bata stores. Bata Bullets collaboration with French Designer Julien David, $99, available at the Actually Store in Orchard Gateway from Monday. All the shows were trendy, upbeat and surprisingly fun. The dapper direction is spearheaded by chief executive officer Alexis Nasard, who joined Bata in April last year. At the event, he highlighted Bata's new manifesto, "Me & Comfortable with it". He says the label will offer sexy, comfortable and surprisingly affordable shoes to a younger target group of women and men of all shapes and sizes. "We refuse the dictate that a woman in the 21st century has to choose between being gorgeous, beautiful and comfortable. "We refuse the dictate that style has to be obscenely expensive and we refuse the dictate that for a woman to be beautiful and feel good about herself, she needs to be 180cm tall and 60kg light." Lebanon-born Mr Nasard, who has a Master of Business Administration from the University of California, Berkeley, was previously the global chief marketing officer at beer brand Heineken and a general manager at multinational manufacturer Procter & Gamble. Speaking to The Straits Times during the event, president of Bata Asia Pacific Roberto Longo admitted that in the past, the label did not pay as much attention to style, but "focused on more everyday shoes". The 59-year-old Italian, who has been with Bata for 40 years, says today's consumer is more sophisticated, affluent and more in touch with fashion trends. "Today, every lady has at least 20 pairs of shoes in her wardrobe. So we said, we would like to be present in that wardrobe with Bata shoes." Mr Longo says the brand decided to have its own fashion weekend to announce to the world that Bata is changing and aligning itself with the current demands of the younger customer. "We realise that some were no longer shopping at Bata. They were getting out to other stores because they were not finding what they wanted here. This repositioning is an invitation to come back to Bata." Mr Longo says that the brand, long regarded in Singapore as the go-to supplier of school shoes and footwear for the more mature set, wants to focus on working adults who are aged 20 to 35. Bata is so serious about catering to this market segment that it has created two characters that embody its new target customer. These characters, the creation of Mr Nasard, have been named Angela and Roberto. They are used to guide Bata's shoe designs, marketing campaigns and the way sales staff will be trained to approach customers. Mr Longo, who says the male character was not named after himself, notes that Angela and Roberto are between the ages of 20 and 35, working and possibly have young children. The same two personas are used all over the world, with the characters in each country having some distinctions. "We keep these two individuals in mind when we design collections. We ask ourselves, 'what do they need?'. When they go to work, go for parties in the evening, when they spend the weekend walking about Singapore, what shoes do they need at every stage, every day?" Mr Longo, who is based in Singapore, says it is the most evolved market in South-east Asia. "It is much more influenced by the European styles - what happens on the runways there. The acceptance of new trends is also faster in Singapore." On the impetus for rebranding, he says: "We realised that today's working women want to be sexy. And shoes are a part of the sexy feminine image. But we saw that most of the time, sexy shoes are not comfortable. So our mission is to combine the two. We want to make sexy comfortable while making comfortable sexy." Bata was founded in Zlin, a city in south-eastern Moravia in the Czech Republic, in 1894 by Tomas Bata. He organised operations into autonomous workshops and departments, creating an efficient production, distribution and marketing system which allowed Bata to expand. By 1912, the company was employing 600 full-time workers. By 1939, it had established its presence in more than 30 countries. Its global spread continued even as the company was handed down to younger generations of the Bata family. Bata entered Singapore in August 1931, planting its first store at Capitol Building in Stamford Road. The label now has 42 locations here. Shoes are made in various countries, including Indonesia, India, Italy and China. Though the brand declines to release sales figures, Bata has been consistently opening new stores. It opened more than 800 concept stores internationally in the last four years. Last year, in Singapore, Bata opened six new stores. Today, it has more than 5,200 retail stores in over 70 countries. The brand also intends to change the look of its stores. It is putting aside the cluttered and old-fashioned image for wider shelves to better present shoe collections. There will be structured themes - such as a section dedicated to ballet flats of different colours and another featuring floral-themed sneakers - to guide customers along each shoe range. Stores will also be more spacious to create a better ambience. Mr Longo says these changes were first tested in Singapore in Bata's new Westgate location which opened in February this year. Tough road ahead even with rebranding The label is also renovating and expanding its store in VivoCity to match its rebranding message. The store will reopen next month. "The store in VivoCity will have screens that showcase fashion trends and information about the latest Bata shoe technologies," says Mr Longo. Technologies include Bata Insolia, which helps to boost the comfort of high-heeled shoes. According to Bata, the patented weight- shift technology distributes weight equally between the toe and the heel areas. Bata sales staff have been trained to better serve younger customers who want better service, for instance, sharing knowledge about shoe benefits like Insolia. He adds: "We realised that Angela and Roberto would want to be served by professionals who can help them to find the right fit of shoe and understand the material of the shoes." But will this be an uphill climb for a brand with a conservative image so entrenched in people's minds? Mr Longo says no. "The store at Westgate with the new look has been very well received." The Bata veteran also makes it clear that the company will not alienate its current customers. "Now we see that a dominant segment of the market are those who are 20 to 35. But we will also never forget the customers that have patronised our stores all these years." Price points will remain the same, for instance, in the range of $30 to $60. Retail experts agree that the label needs to rebrand if it is to stay relevant and relate to the elusive millennial crowd. Dr Lewis Lim, associate professor of marketing practice at Nanyang Business School, says: "The new millennial generation has a very different concept of 'cool footwear' and the previous Bata brand image doesn't fit the modern definition of 'cool'." Bata needs to refresh its image to remain relevant in the competitive and cluttered marketplace, he says. National University of Singapore associate professor of marketing Ang Swee Hoon says the rebranding also targets a segment that spends more on shoes and clothing. "The younger generation wants more shoes - whether for work or for leisure. And for those who have not bought a house yet, they have no mortgage loans to consider. Hence disposable income is relatively high." As to whether the rebranding will succeed, experts say Bata may have to do more. Dr Lim says it cannot simply be about introducing trendy shoe designs. He says: "Young consumers are fussy about choosing brands that allow them to express their attitudes. When a young consumer puts on a pair of Bata shoes, the shoes need to say something complimentary about the person. There needs to be a level of sophistication in the brand personality." He adds that the label cannot expect to be seen as a cool brand if it is available only in neighbourhood stores. "The shoes need to hit the shelves of trendy fashion stores and be available at leading online stores where young consumers shop for apparel and accessories." Mr Samuel Tan, course manager of diploma in retail management at the Temasek Polytechnic School of Business, says the challenge for Bata is whether the re-invention differentiates it enough from competitors. "Brands that are appealing to younger customers are also required to constantly evolve to stay relevant to market demands. Bata would have to do this to succeed." Customers who shop at the well-known footwear provider say they are looking forward to the change. Graphic designer Fiona Tan, 29, who has been buying bags and wallets from Bata for the last three years, says she will check out the label's new footwear because she trusts the quality of Bata products and likes their affordability. "So far, I've not bought their shoes because the designs are not to my liking. They aren't very eye-catching and colours can be dull. But I would give them a chance if they are more stylish." Mother-of-one Hannah Tsang, 31, who buys Bata shoes about twice a year, says she will buy more if trendier options are available. "I've gone to Bata since I was young and have the impression that their shoes are long-lasting. But the designs have been quite outdated or 'aunty-ish'. If that changes, it will be good." Changing customer perceptions will not be easy, but Mr Longo is confident in Bata's established history and new aspirational manifesto. "I think that with this rejuvenation of Bata, plus the fact that we are always updating and improving the quality and construction of our material, we can offer the most surprising designs at the best affordable price to our consumer." As for the Singaporean spin on what Bata means, Mr Longo says he has heard of the Buy And Throw Away acronym. "But I have another version which I prefer. Buy And Treasure Always."

BUSINESS COMPANY TOWN Cord cutting and a soft advertising market take a toll on media stocks The Escape Hatch Identification Michael Yarish / Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc. "The Big Bang Theory" on CBS remains one of the most popular TV shows. "The Big Bang Theory" on CBS remains one of the most popular TV shows. (Michael Yarish / Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc.) Meg JamesContact Reporter A slowdown in advertising spending and a rise in cord-cutting by pay-TV customers are giving Wall Street fresh jitters about the health of the television industry. During the first quarter of the year, an estimated 762,000 pay-TV customers unplugged their satellite or cable TV subscriptions — a dramatic acceleration of the cord-cutting trend. At the same time, media companies began struggling to sell their commercial spots, particularly those on cable television channels. CBS Corp., Time Warner Inc., Viacom, AMC Networks and NBCUniversal all reported declines in advertising spending in the first quarter — a consistent refrain that alarmed analysts. “Given some uncertainty in the economy, we think that advertisers are holding back a little bit,” John Martin, chief executive of Time Warner Inc.’s Turner networks, including TBS, TNT and CNN, told analysts Wednesday during an earnings call. “They're taking a little bit more of a wait-and-see approach.” TV ratings have been strained as younger consumers spend less time watching traditional channels in favor of Netflix and other streaming options. That has dampened the enthusiasm of advertisers who now have more options for where to spend their dollars. Those pressures, along with signs of a possible economic slowdown, have caused a decline in advertising revenue that buttress the economics of the television business. AMC Networks saw advertising revenue fall 6% in the first quarter compared with a year earlier. Viacom reported U.S. ad sales declined 4% during the same period. Ad revenue declined about 3% at NBCUniversal's cable channels and 2% at Time Warner's Turner networks. Want to watch movies at home sooner? Warner Bros. chief reports 'good progress' on touchy issue Meg James Hollywood studios have been nudging theater chains to let them release new movies on home video only weeks after the movies hit the big screen.

Theaters don't like that idea, but according to the head of Warner Bros. Entertainment, they might be coming around. “We continue to have constructive... (Meg James) “There are real factors underlying a slowdown in the media economy,” said Brian Wieser, advertising analyst with Pivotal Research Group. “There are technology issues, with changing consumer preferences [and] macro economic uncertainty.” The weak advertising market comes at an inopportune time for the television industry. In less than two weeks, the major broadcasters will unveil their new fall prime-time schedules to advertisers in New York as part of an annual ritual to encourage them to fork over big bucks for commercial time. Networks sell the bulk of their advertising time during the springtime advertising market known as the upfront. The soft advertising sales at Time Warner triggered the sell-off of media stocks, which continued Thursday with additional earnings’ reports. New York-based Viacom, which owns Comedy Central, MTV and Nickelodeon, delivered better-than-expected earnings and revenue growth but its stock still got punished. Viacom’s shares tumbled nearly 15% in just two days and executives tried to assure investors that its ratings-challenged cable channels were still in demand. Viacom closed down $2.80, or 7.1%, at $36.46 on Thursday. “Pay TV has gotten very expensive,” Viacom Chief Executive Bob Bakish acknowledged Thursday in a conference call with analysts. “You are talking $100-plus [monthly revenue to pay-TV companies] in a world where people have to pay for cellphones and the like. There’s a lot of stress on that machine.” Other media stocks also got pinched this week. AMC Networks' shares have declined 8% since Monday. Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox lost 5% of its value, CBS Corp. declined 4.5% and Comcast, owner of NBCUniversal, lost 3%. Walt Disney Co., which reports earnings Tuesday, declined 3%. Several media executives said Thursday that they’ve seen demand for their advertising time steadily increase in recent weeks, but not fast enough to help their first-quarter numbers. The slowdown is troublesome because many economists consider advertising spending a bellwether for the health of the overall U.S. economy. Companies spend more on marketing when they feel confident about the future. Media executives said automobile and pharmaceutical companies in particular have been trimming spending. In an ominous sign, consumer products giant Procter & Gamble announced last week that it would shave $2 billion from its marketing budgets over five years. Pay-TV providers have been hardest hit. Charter Communications’ shares lost about 7% of their value since Monday. Charter disclosed this week that it had lost about 100,000 video customers in the quarter. AT&T U-Verse service lost 233,000 subscribers in the quarter. And Frontier Communications lost 80,000 pay-TV subscribers during the period. Telecommunications analyst Craig Moffett said the drop of about 762,000 video customers for the quarter was five times worse than the 141,000 shed in the first quarter of 2016. “The first quarter is usually a seasonally strong one for pay-TV. It wasn't this year," Moffett said. "It was the worst-ever first-quarter subscriber loss." The sell-off was an echo to the media meltdown in the summer of 2015 when Disney executives disclosed that the company’s ESPN networks were losing more subscribers than anticipated because millions of consumers had opted for “skinny” pay-TV bundles with fewer channels. Despite the market’s reaction, TV executives this week were optimistic that advertisers would continue to line up to buy television time in the upfront market, which will kick off in two weeks. “The upfront, to me, is going to be very strong. There is a lot of demand for our product,” CBS Chief Executive Leslie Moonves told analysts on an earnings call Thursday. Late Thursday, CBS reported a 30% decline in advertising spending to $1.6 billion, but the company said tough comparisons were responsible for the drop. In 2016, CBS broadcast the Super Bowl and an additional NFL playoff game — which brought in more than $350 million in ad revenue. Removing the Super Bowl and NFL playoff game revenue from the equation, CBS said its ad revenue would have fallen by only about 1% in the quarter. CBS shares closed up Thursday 39 cents, or less than 1%, to $63.85. Caption 'The Fate of the Furious' movie review by Justin Chang Justin Chang reviews "The Fate of the Furious," directed by F.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 4 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Use of Recyclable Toothpaste Tube to Emerge as Trend in Oral Care Market Albany, NY — (SBWIRE) — 05/04/2017 — MarketResearchReports.biz has announced the addition of a new market study to its repository, titled „Global Oral Care Market (Toothbrush, Tooth Whitener, Denture Care And Toothpaste) Size, Trends & Forecasts (2017-2021).” The growing awareness about the benefits of maintaining oral hygiene is the key driver for this market. The growing prevalence of various dental issues among people across the world is another factor creating a heightened demand for oral care products. Loss of teeth, dry mouth, dental caries, oral cancer, and the prevalence of periodontitis among the geriatric population are some of the other factors ensuring the consistent demand for oral care products. In addition to this, attractive and improvement in product packaging is pushing the global oral care market further. Some of the factors inhibiting the growth of the oral care market are: high cost of products, growing competition, and a lack of awareness about many advanced oral care products. View Report @ http://www.marketresearchreports.biz/analysis/1064497 Players in the market are focusing on enhanced packaging of oral care products. Also, developing newer formulations is a key strategy adopted by players in the market to stay ahead of competition. Moreover, aggressive promotional and marketing activities comprise some of the most commonly adopted strategies by leading players. Players in the market are competing with each other on the basis of price, service, innovation, quality, reputation, promotion, and distribution. However, an increase in competition will lead to each player trying to reduce product price and this in turn will affect the profit margins and thus, the future growth prospects of the company. Some of the key players profiled in the market are: Colgate-Palmolive, Glaxo Smith Kline, Unilever, and P&G Get Sample Copy Of This Report @ http://www.marketresearchreports.biz/sample/sample/1064497 One of the recent trends in the market is the use of recyclable tubes or packaging for toothpaste. This is promoting and encouraging consumers to buy products that contribute to sustainability, thereby benefitting the manufacturer. A case in point would be Colgate-Palmolive. The company has started making use of recyclable toothpaste tubes and this has resulted in a number of users purchasing their products as an increasing number of urban and educated people opt for eco-friendly products, in a bid to save the environment. Another trend in the market is the use of automated tooth brush. Online purchase of oral care products is becoming increasingly popular. The trend of using whitening toothpaste for beauty purpose is also gaining traction. View Press Release @ http://www.marketresearchreports.biz/pressrelease/4340 On the basis of geography, the market is segmented into Europe, Asia Pacific, North America, and the Rest of the World. Of these, North America led in the oral care market owing to a higher patient awareness about oral hygiene. Europe trailed North America in terms of lead, boosted by the presence of many key players. It is estimated that Asia Pacific will show remarkable growth in the coming years on account of the improving awareness among the masses and increase in the healthcare expenditure in the developing nations of India, China, and South Korea.

Black ash from a stack of smouldering tyres falls like snow on workers picketing outside the Whirlpool plant in Amiens over the company's plans to move their jobs to Poland. It was here that the battle lines in the presidential run-off were drawn, when Le Pen -- who has run as the candidate of the dispossessed -- upstaged Macron by making a surprise whirlwind visit to the picket line as Macron was meeting unions to discuss the plant's future. The pro-EU Macron arrived afterwards, mobbed by the workers who initially booed him, but he eventually managed to turn the situation around and engage them in dialogue about the pros and cons of globalisation. For the workers, the dust-up between Le Pen and Macron -- over which the two candidates traded blows in Wednesday's TV debate -- was a zero-sum game. "They came looking for votes and to make promises. It was a publicity stunt," Corinne Bizet, one of the 290 Whirlpool workers whose jobs are on the line, said Wednesday. The announcement in January that Whirlpool was moving production to the Polish city of Lodz was a blow for Amiens, a city of 130,000 people in northern France still reeling from the loss of 1,100 jobs at a Goodyear tyre factory in 2014. Marine Le Pen was warmly received at the factory STR, AFP Like many of the workers, Bizet has spent nearly two decades at the plant, where she met her husband. At 49, she now fears being left on the jobs shelf. Standing in the car park, a besuited Macron attempted to convince the strikers that, far from protecting factory jobs, Le Pen's proposals to pull France out of the EU would deter new investment. "The man has no heart. He only came here because she came," said Bizet, a chatty mother of three with plum hair and a small stud earring under her lower lip. But while praising Le Pen as "closer to the people", Bizet expressed misgivings about Le Pen's proposal to leave the EU and dump the euro after a period of negotiations. "Le Pen thinks that will turn France around but there's no magic wand," she said with an air of resignation. - 'Survival of the fittest' - Emmanuel Macron's visit to the same factory was chaotic Eric FEFERBERG, AFP Globalisation has dominated the most divisive French election in decades, with a string of factory closures fuelling fury with Europe and mainstream politics. On Wednesday, Le Pen, who has pushed a French-first approach to jobs and trade, accused Macron of hanging out workers to dry with a "survival of the fittest" approach. "Your strategy is to tell lots of lies, you don't propose anything," Macron retorted, charging that Le Pen -- who floated the prospect of investing state money to save the Whirlpool plant -- of peddling "rubbish". David Gallopin, a line manager at Whirlpool, said he had gone from "zero percent convinced to 50 percent convinced" by Macron after his visit to the factory. The 39-year-old politician cited an export-led Procter & Gamble detergent plant employing over 1,000 people just five kilometres (three miles) away from Whirlpool in Amiens as an argument against protectionism. "Without leaving Europe, there are things we need to change," said Gallopin, a softly-spoken 49-year-old whose son works at P&G. "If we can't stop companies offshoring, we have to ensure they don't leave people by the wayside when they leave," he argued. - Echoes of conflict - Tyres were burning as Emmanuel Macron made his visit Eric FEFERBERG, AFP The debate over globalisation has particular resonance in the northern Somme area which saw fierce fighting during World War I. Philippe Melen, a 64-year-old jazz musician whose British grandfather died in France during the war, joined around 160 people on a march through Amiens on Wednesday to show his opposition to Le Pen and her anti-immigration National Front. "Madame Le Pen wants to put France in a glass case but it's not possible. That could take us back down the path of war," said the white-haired, moustachioed Melen, who wore a suit and his grandfather's war medal for the occasion. Addressing the gathering outside Amiens town hall, centrist mayor Brigitte Foure expressed understanding for the frustration of the Whirlpool workers. "But this anger must not lead to a vote of revolt and protest on behalf of the far right," she urged. Tonio Abenhosa, one of the plant's union leaders, said he would cast a blank vote to protest what he saw as the powerlessness of French politicians in the face of multinationals and the EU. "We need a revolution to win back our rights," he declared. Gallopin said he was counting on Macron to pressure Whirlpool into giving the workers a good redundancy package if elected. "He said he would not let us down," he said. "I hope he keeps his word."

Investors in Facebook Inc. should channel their zen. Nothing in the social network's first-quarter results merits getting stressed out about, despite the dip in the shares on Thursday. Yes, Facebook warned that revenue growth would slow "meaningfully" this year because it can't keep increasing how many ads it pumps out on its news feed without driving users away. But Mark Zuckerberg can count on Instagram to take up some of the slack. Morgan Stanley estimates that selling more ads on the photo-sharing app will add $3.6 billion of incremental ad revenue this year, about 10 percent of the analysts' annual forecast. And Facebook is doing smart things to develop video across its apps to get its hands on money that's now being spent on television ads. As Facebook nears the five-year anniversary of its initial public offering, it's worth reflecting on how far it's come. In 2012, Zuckerberg's baby was the world's tenth-biggest seller of ads behind a bunch of traditional media companies such as CBS Corp. and 21st Century Fox Inc., according to Zenith Media. It has trounced almost all of them to rise to number two in the rankings, surpassed only by Alphabet Inc., the Google parent that dominates search ads. Together, these two companies controlled one-fifth of the $543 billion spent on ads last year, Zenith says, up from 11 percent in 2012. They're quite the duopoly, as Gadfly's Shira Ovide has explained.  In five years, Zuckerberg has made Facebook a place that global brands can't avoid if they want to reach a growing audience of almost 1.94 billion people. Many brands probably wish it were otherwise. Just look at the complaints about Facebook's flawed video metrics, concerns about violence on its live streaming and Procter & Gamble Co.'s lament about "crappy" web ads. But Facebook's size and detailed targeting data make it irreplaceable to advertisers trying to sell everything from laundry soap to trucks.  Even a slower-growing Facebook will be a money-spinning juggernaut for a long while. Does it really matter if Facebook sales are increasing by about 40 percent a year versus 60 percent if what it offers to brands is better than other advertising outlets? Nope.  No Worries Facebook's rate of sales growth is slowing but it remains a powerful, irreplaceable advertising outlet Source: Zenith Media, company reports The Q1 2017 figure is compared to the same quarter a year earlier And Facebook's grip on the number two spot is strong. TV networks simply can't offer the same scale as global internet platforms. And Asia's formidable giants, including Tencent Holdings Ltd. and Baidu Inc., haven't yet ventured abroad much. Twitter Inc. and Snap Inc. still only appeal to niche audiences. Look at this chart of how the world's biggest sellers of advertising have evolved in the past five years. Tech groups are displacing TV companies at a rapid clip. In 2012, only Google and Facebook were in the top ten. In 2016, half the top ten were digital: Verizon Communications Inc. joined with its pending acquisition of Yahoo, as did Baidu Inc. and Microsoft Corp. And the shift of marketing dollars from old media to new isn't even over. Online ad spending will surpass television this year for the first time.

Church & Dwight Reports Q1 Reported EPS of $0.51; Adjusted EPS of $0.52 Exceeds Q1 Outlook 2017 Full Year EPS Outlook: $1.75 to $1.77; Adjusted $1.92 +8.5% May 04, 2017 07:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time EWING, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Church & Dwight Co., Inc. (NYSE:CHD): 2017 First Quarter Results   2017 Full Year Outlook Reported sales growth +3.3%; Organic +2.3% Reported and Organic sales growth of approximately +3% Reported Gross Margin +90 bps; Adjusted +110 bps Reported Gross Margin +60 bps; Adjusted +40 bps Reported Operating Margin +130 bps; Adjusted +170 bps Reported EPS $1.75-$1.77 flat; Adjusted +8.5% Reported EPS growth of 18.6%; Adjusted 20.9% Cash from operations $650MM Church & Dwight Co., Inc. (NYSE:CHD) today announced first quarter 2017 reported EPS of $0.51 per share, an 18.6% increase. Adjusted EPS was $0.52, a 20.9% increase excluding a $0.01 charge related to the sale of the Brazil Specialty Products business and including a $0.03 per share positive impact from adopting the new stock option accounting standard. First quarter 2017 reported net sales grew 3.3% to $877.2 million. Organic net sales grew 2.3% driven by global Consumer products growth of 2.6%. Organic sales were driven by volume growth of 2.7%, partially offset by 0.4% from unfavorable product mix and pricing. This organic growth is on top of 5.2% organic growth in Q1 2016. Matthew Farrell, Chief Executive Officer, commented, “We have delivered strong results as momentum from 2016 has continued into early 2017 including organic net sales growth of 2.3%, adjusted gross margin expansion of 110 basis points and adjusted earnings growth of 20.9%. The International business grew organic sales 11.8% as our investment strategy continues to pay off. We are pleased that 6 out of 10 power brands gained share.” First Quarter Review Consumer Domestic reported net sales were $659.7 million, a $11.9 million or 1.8% increase. Organic sales increased by 0.8% primarily due to growth in ARM & HAMMER liquid and unit dose laundry detergents, BATISTE dry shampoo, ARM & HAMMER baking soda, ARM & HAMMER cat litter, partially offset by declines in TROJAN condoms and XTRA laundry detergent. Results were in line with the Company’s expectations as the business anniversaried its highest quarterly growth rate last year (4.5%). Volume growth contributed 1.1% to organic sales partially offset by a decrease of 0.3% attributable to product mix and pricing. ARM & HAMMER unit dose laundry detergent continues to grow share by growing nearly twice the category for the fourth consecutive quarter. Sales in non-measured channels continued to grow, especially online retail sales which approximately doubled. Growth in non-measured channels accounted for approximately 110 basis points of organic sales growth. Consumer International reported net sales were $143.1 million, a $15.7 million or 12.3% increase driven by broad based household and personal care sales across a number of countries. Organic sales increased by 11.8%, driven primarily by BATISTE, FEMFRESH and OXICLEAN in the export business and ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry detergent and ARM & HAMMER cat litter in Canada. Volume increased 13.2%, partially offset by 1.4% from unfavorable product mix and pricing. Specialty Products reported net sales were $74.4 million, a $0.6 million or 0.8% increase. Organic sales decreased 0.3% due to lower volumes in specialty chemical products. The animal productivity business improved in both price and volume on higher demand from the U.S. dairy industry as milk prices and dairy farm profitability appear to have stabilized. Gross margin increased 90 basis points to 45.5% on a reported basis. On an adjusted basis, excluding the Brazil charge, gross margin increased 110 basis points. The increase was due to productivity programs and the impact of a higher margin acquired business, offset by higher raw material costs. Marketing expense was $90.8 million, a decrease of $1.7 million or 1.8%. Marketing expense as a percentage of net sales decreased 60 basis points to 10.3%. Selling, general, and administrative expense (SG&A) was $112.4 million or 12.8% of net sales, a 20 basis point increase primarily due to the Brazil charge. On an adjusted basis, excluding the Brazil charge, SG&A was flat as a percentage of net sales. Income from Operations on a reported basis was $196.1 million or 22.4% of net sales, a 130 basis point increase. On an adjusted basis, excluding the Brazil charge, operating margin increased 170 basis points to 22.8% of net sales. The reported effective tax rate was 30.9%, compared to 34.7% last year. On an adjusted basis, the effective rate was 30.3%, excluding the Brazil charge. The full year adjusted tax rate is forecasted to be 33.5%. Operating Cash Flow For the first three months of 2017, net cash from operating activities was $131.5 million, a $46.3 million decrease from the prior year due to an increase in working capital partially offset by higher cash earnings. The working capital increase was primarily driven by $25 million in deferred and incentive compensation and profit sharing payments. Capital expenditures for the first three months were $2.8 million, a $5.7 million decrease from the prior year. The Company’s full year outlook for capital expenditures is estimated to be approximately $50 million. At March 31, 2017, cash on hand was $139.5 million, while total debt was $1,278.6 million. The Company continues to have significant financial flexibility for acquisitions. Acquisition On May 1, 2017, the Company acquired Agro BioSciences, Inc. for $75 million plus a contingent payment of up to an additional $25 million based on business performance. Agro BioSciences, Inc. is an innovator and leader in developing custom probiotic products for poultry, cattle and swine. This business is complementary to the Company’s animal productivity business. Annual sales are approximately $11 million. The business is expected to grow rapidly to meet the growing demand for probiotic products to maintain the health and productivity of animals in an antibiotic free environment. The acquisition was financed with debt and is expected to be neutral to EPS in 2017 due to transition costs. In 2018, we expect the acquisition to be accretive to EPS. The Company intends to continue to aggressively pursue acquisitions. Sale of Brazil Chemical Business In March, the Company completed the previously announced sale of its Brazil chemical business for $4.5 million. EPS was impacted $0.01 from charges related to the sale. 2017 New Products Mr. Farrell commented, “Innovation continues to be a big driver of our success. In support of our long term strategy to drive revenue and earnings growth, we have launched new products in several categories. We launched ARM & HAMMER SLIDE cat litter, a revolutionary new litter that doesn’t stick to the litter box, and ARM & HAMMER PLUS OXICLEAN unit dose 3-in-1 POWER PAKS laundry detergent. We are restaging OXICLEAN liquid laundry detergent with improved efficacy, claims and packaging. VITAFUSION is launching a new energy gummy vitamin that supports everyday energy needs and alertness. TROJAN launched a new XOXO upscale condom targeting both men and women with a soft touch, aloe lubricated latex in a unique portable carrying case. We are expanding offerings and distribution of the BATISTE brand, leveraging its #1 U.S. share position in the dry shampoo category.” Outlook for 2017 Mr. Farrell stated, “2017 is off to a strong start with solid first quarter results. We believe that we are positioned to continue to deliver strong sales and earnings growth with our balanced portfolio of value and premium products, the launch of innovative new products, aggressive productivity programs and tight management of overhead costs. Although categories are growing slower than expected due to continued discounting by competitors, we are confident in achieving our 2017 business targets.” With regard to 2017, Mr. Farrell said, “We expect reported and organic sales growth of approximately 3%. We expect reported and adjusted gross margin to expand by approximately 60 and 40 basis points, respectively, reflecting rising commodity costs and foreign exchange headwinds. We expect marketing spending to be 12.0% of net sales, a 20 basis point decrease, as we make incremental investments in trade and couponing in support of our new products. SG&A is expected to increase 160 basis points. On an adjusted basis, SG&A is expected to increase 20 basis points to 12.8% of net sales after excluding expenses related to the sale of the Brazil chemical business and previously announced U.K. pension settlement charges. The 20 basis point increase is primarily due to amortization from our three most recent acquisitions. Reported operating margin is expected to decrease 80 basis points or increase 40 basis points when adjusted to exclude the pension and Brazil charges.” Mr. Farrell said, “2017 will be an exciting year for Church & Dwight based on our continued focus on innovation and confidence in gross margin expansion. On a reported basis, EPS is expected to be $1.75 to $1.77 per share, which includes a $0.01 negative impact from the Brazil charge and $0.14 to $0.16 negative impact from the pension settlement. Excluding these items, we expect to achieve 8.5% adjusted EPS growth or $1.92 per share which includes a $0.03 impact from adopting the new stock option accounting standard. The 2017 outlook equates to 9.5% currency neutral adjusted EPS growth excluding a 1% negative impact from foreign exchange. In 2017, we expect adjusted free cash flow to exceed adjusted net income as we have in previous years.” In conclusion, Mr. Farrell said, “For the second quarter, we are off to a strong start and expect reported and organic sales growth of approximately 1-2%. We are supporting our key new product launches with a significant increase in promotion and coupon support and, as planned, a significant shift of marketing spend from Q4 into Q2 and Q3 to support our innovation. Gross margin for the first half is expected to be flat. Marketing is expected to be in excess of 14% of net sales in Q2. We expect reported EPS of $0.21 to $0.23 and adjusted of $0.37 per share in the second quarter. We expect first half adjusted EPS to increase approximately 5%.” Church & Dwight Co., Inc. will host a conference call to discuss first quarter 2017 earnings results on May 4, 2017 at 10:00 a.m. Eastern time.

Organic Sales Growth: This press release provides information regarding organic sales growth, namely net sales growth excluding the effect of acquisitions and foreign exchange rate changes. Management believes that the presentation of organic sales growth is useful to investors because it enables them to assess, on a consistent basis, sales trends related to products that were marketed by the Company during the entirety of relevant periods, excluding the impact of acquisitions and excluding foreign exchange rate changes that are out of the control of, and do not reflect the performance of, the Company and management. Adjusted Gross Margin: This press release provides information regarding adjusted gross margin, namely gross margin excluding the effect of charges taken in 2016 and 2017 related to the Brazil Specialty Products business. We believe that excluding these charges from gross margin provides a useful measure of the Company’s ongoing operating performance and a more effective comparison to prior periods by excluding significant one-time events. Adjusted SG&A: This press release presents information regarding adjusted SG&A, namely selling, general and administrative expenses excluding 2017 charges related to the Brazil Specialty Products business and a 2017 expected settlement charge related to our U.K. pension. We believe that this metric enhances investors’ understanding of the Company’s year over year expenses by excluding certain significant one-time items. Adjusted Operating Income and Margin: This press release provides information regarding adjusted operating income and margin, which exclude the effect of charges taken in 2016 and expected to be taken in 2017 related to the Brazil Specialty Products business and an expected settlement charge related to our U.K. pension. We believe that excluding these charges from operating income and margin provides a useful measure of the Company’s ongoing operating performance and a more effective comparison to prior periods by excluding significant one-time events. Adjusted EPS: This press release also presents adjusted EPS, namely, earnings per share calculated in accordance with GAAP, as adjusted to exclude significant one-time items that are not indicative of the Company’s period to period performance. We believe that this metric provides investors a useful perspective of underlying business trends and results and provides useful supplemental information regarding our year over year earnings per share growth. Adjusted and forecasted EPS for 2017 excludes charges related to the Brazil Specialty Products business and the settlement charges related to our U.K. pension. Adjusted EPS for 2016 excludes charges related to the Brazil Specialty Products business. Free Cash Flow: Free cash flow is defined as cash from operating activities less capital expenditures. Management views free cash flow as an important measure because it is one factor in determining the amount of cash available for dividends and discretionary investment. Free Cash Flow as Percentage of Adjusted Net Income: Free cash flow as percentage of adjusted net income is defined as the ratio of free cash flow to net income excluding the Brazil Specialty Products business and the settlement charges related to our U.K. pension. Management views this as a measure of how effective the Company manages its cash flow relating to working capital and capital expenditures.   CHURCH & DWIGHT CO., INC.

Addressing an annual press conference of his Patanjali brand of consumer goods, Ramdev told the media that India should “follow Israel’s cue and behead 100, if they decapitate even one or two of our soldiers”. “I have seen the relatives of those soldiers crying and asking why my child’s body was mutilated,” he said. India has accused the Pakistani army of Monday’s killing and mutilation of two Indian soldiers on the Line of Control. Continuing in the same vein, he referred to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and said “patriotism is in his blood and he won’t flinch from following his duty”. On his brand Patanjali, Ramdev said by next year the homegrown label will have a production capacity of Rs 60,000 crore. Presently, he said, it is Rs 30,000 crore. He said that Chinese products “must be boycotted”, and cited the boycotting of foreign goods called for by Mahatma Gandhi and Chandrashekhar Azad during British rule. “Even if one is supposed to shell out a few paise more for ‘swadeshi’ products, he must do so. We require a general will power for the boycotting of Chinese goods.. Foreign companies have always looted India,” Ramdev said, and gave the example of the East India Company run by the British during the colonial period as one of ‘plunderers’. He also accused multinational brands like Colgate, Unilever, Proctor and Gamble, of “hoarding capital worth over Rs 50 lakh crore in India”. On May 3, Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated a research institute run by Ramdev’s Patanjali Ayurveda in Uttarakhand’s Haridwar. The institute claims to have developed new varieties of wheat and chilli seeds that can more than double the yield – an attempt to fight back criticism after a set of recent reverses that saw the firm’s products fail laboratory tests and taken off shelves in army stores. tags Baba Ramdev Line of Control India-Pak tension Patanjali brand Indian jawans mutilated more from india Congress appoints new state chiefs in Uttarakhand and Punjab May 04, 2017 16:52 IST Mutilation of soldiers: Pakistan says ‘provocative statements’ by India will vitiate environment May 04, 2017 16:30 IST Is Your Couch Making You Cough?

We like this definition. New members bring diverse experience in business, investment, philanthropy and enhancing the lives of children and adults with autism NEW YORK (PRWEB) May 04, 2017 Autism Speaks, which is dedicated to promoting solutions across the spectrum and throughout the life span, announces the election of three new members to its board of directors, effective immediately. “We couldn’t be more grateful for the commitment and generosity of these accomplished leaders,” said Angela Geiger, Autism Speaks president and CEO. “Not only do they bring years of experience in business, investment and nonprofit leadership, each new member is motivated by a personal connection to the autism community.” TOM BERNARD had a 30-year career in global finance before retiring in Aspen, Colo. to devote himself to writing and philanthropy. He has served on several corporate and nonprofit boards, and was board president of Aspen Words, the literary arm of the Aspen Institute. In 2004, Mr. Bernard and his wife Sallie – a former Autism Speaks board member – founded The Extreme Sports Camp, which provided summer and winter recreational opportunities for children on the autism spectrum. The nonprofit organization expanded to include adults and year-round programs beyond recreation, including job training, life skills and the arts. With the organization’s broadened mission came a new name: Ascendigo. Mr. Bernard also purchased and remodeled a home in Carbondale, Colo., called The Yellow House, which is now home to three young men with autism, including the Bernards’ son, Bill, and a host couple. The Yellow House Operations, LLC staff rotates to provide 24 / 7 supervision, and the residents participate in Ascendigo programs along with non-residents. With state-of-the-art safety and supervisory technology, the house is a model of supervised community living for adults who are more significantly impacted by autism. "The needs in autism are tremendous and so much work needs to be done,” Mr. Bernard said. “I look forward to being part of an organization that can change the research, services, and public views of autism in large and meaningful ways." BRIAN L. HARPER is the chief executive officer of Rouse Properties, a New York-based real estate investment company. Its portfolio consists of 24 million square feet of shopping centers across 21 states. Mr. Harper was one of the original members of the team that was instrumental to the company’s formation and the initial public offering in 2012. He previously served as the company’s chief operating officer and executive vice president of leasing and acquisitions. Before joining Rouse, Mr. Harper was the senior vice president of leasing for the real estate investing company GGP, where he oversaw the leasing efforts of a $2 billion multi-state portfolio. Prior to his tenure at GGP, he was a vice president at RED Development and an associate at Cohen-Esrey Real Estate Services, LLC. Mr. Harper has been involved with all facets of real estate, from new development, asset repositions, distressed real estate and stabilized asset management. With more than 18 years of experience in the industry, he holds numerous awards and was selected for the 2014 list of Chain Store Age’s “10 Under 40” in real estate. He is also a frequent lecturer at several leading universities. Mr. Harper is on the board of directors for Liberty Church, and he was a co-founder of Breaking Ground Foundation, whose mission is to build sustainable community centers in developing nations. He earned his bachelor’s degree from the University of Kansas. Mr. Harper and his wife, Laleh, have two children. “I have a child with autism, and I am fully aware that our world needs to have a better understanding of autism spectrum disorder,” said Mr. Harper. “I am deeply passionate about ensuring that all those with autism have the same opportunities available to them that those without this diagnosis have.” As a board member, Mr. Harper will co-chair the “Autism Speaks to Wall Street Celebrity Chef Gala.” One of the organization’s signature fundraisers, the gala brings together dozens of top chefs, each cooking table-side to create an intimate dining experience for small groups of guests.

About Autism Autism, or autism spectrum disorder, refers to a broad range of conditions characterized by challenges with social skills, repetitive behaviors, speech and nonverbal communication, as well as by unique strengths and differences. We now know that there is not one autism but many subtypes, most caused by a combination of genetic and environmental influences. An estimated 1 in 68 children is on the autism spectrum. About Autism Speaks Autism Speaks is dedicated to promoting solutions, across the spectrum and throughout the life span, for the needs of individuals with autism and their families. We do this through advocacy and support; increasing understanding and acceptance of autism spectrum disorder; and advancing research into causes and better interventions for autism spectrum disorder and related conditions.

The bipartisan legislation would provide clear and equal protections under federal law for all Americans in vital areas of life, like employment, access to public spaces, housing, credit, education, jury service, and federally-funded programs. Today, in a majority of U.S. states (31), LGBT people remain at risk of being fired, evicted or denied services because of sexual persecution for who they are. “No person’s fundamental rights should be determined by which side of a state line they live on,” said HRC President Chad Griffin. “The Equality Act will once and for all end the unacceptable patchwork of non-discrimination laws across this country that leaves LGBT people at risk. Every American should have a fair chance to earn a living, provide for their families, and live their lives without fear of discrimination. And at its core, that’s what the Equality Act is all about.” “Not only is discrimination is a real and persistent problem for far too many LGBT Americans, but this morally repugnant behavior is perfectly legal in most places,” said James Devine, a New Jersey Democratic strategist. “Americans have a right to privacy and deserve to be protected from bigotry.” Devine said polling has confirmed that nearly two-thirds of self-identified LGBT Americans report experiencing discrimination — including people like Carter Brown, a transgender man from Texas who lost his job after he was outed by his colleagues. Currently, 50 percent of LGBT Americans live in states where they are at risk of being fired, denied housing, or refused service because of who they are. There is no federal law explicitly protecting LGBT people from discrimination, and 31 states still lack fully-inclusive non-discrimination protections for LGBT people. Today’s announcement included unprecedented support from the business community: 92 major corporations have now joined HRC’s Business Coalition for the Equality Act. While the overwhelming majority of America’s leading businesses have already started addressing workplace fairness for LGBT employees, these major employers know how important the need is for a federal standard that treats all employees the same no matter which state they live in. The slate of companies endorsing the Equality Act have combined operations in all 50 states, headquarters spanning 23 states, and collectively generate $2.6 trillion in revenue. In total, these companies employ more than 5.8 million people across the United States. The overwhelming majority of Americans support full federal equality for LGBT people. Polling released last year by the nonpartisan Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI) found that support for a bill like the Equality Act topped 70 percent nationally, including a majority of Democrats, Republicans and Independents. PRRI’s groundbreaking survey included 42,000 interviews in 50 states and found majority support for the Equality Act in all 50 states. The Equality Act is co-sponsored by 241 members of Congress. It was first introduced in 2015 by Representative David Cicilline (D-RI) and by Senators Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) and Cory Booker (D-NJ). Major corporations that have endorsed the Equality Act include Abercrombie & Fitch Co.; Accenture; Adobe Systems Inc.; Advanced Micro Devices Inc.; Airbnb Inc.; Alcoa Inc.; Amazon.com Inc.; American Airlines; American Eagle Outfitters; American Express Global Business Travel; Apple Inc.; Arconic; Automatic Data Processing Inc.; Bank of America; Best Buy Co., Inc.; Biogen; Boehringer Ingelheim USA Corp.; Booz Allen Hamilton Inc.; Broadridge Financial Solutions Inc.; Brown-Forman Corp.; CA Technologies Inc.; Caesars Entertainment Corp.; Capital One Financial Corp.; Cardinal Health Inc.; Cargill Inc.; Chevron Corp.; Choice Hotels International Inc.; Cisco Systems Inc.; The Coca-Cola Co.; Corning Inc.; Cox Enterprises; CVS Health Corp.; Darden Restaurants Inc.; Delhaize America Inc.; Diageo North America; The Dow Chemical Co.; Dropbox Inc.; E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Co. (DuPont); eBay; EMC Corp.; Facebook Inc.; Gap Inc.; General Electric Co.; General Mills Inc.; Google Inc.; The Hershey Company; Hewlett Packard Enterprises; Hilton Worldwide Inc.; HP Inc.; HSN Inc.; Hyatt Hotels Corp.; IBM Corp.; Intel Corp.; InterContinental Hotels Group Americas; Johnson & Johnson; JP Morgan Chase & Co.; Kaiser Permanente; Kellogg Co.; Kenneth Cole Productions; Levi Strauss & Co.; Marriott International Inc.; MasterCard Inc.; McGraw Hill Financial; Microsoft Corp.; Mitchell Gold + Bob Williams; Monsanto Co.; Moody’s Corp.; Nike Inc.; Northrop Grumman Corp.; Office Depot Inc.; Oracle Corp.; Orbitz Worldwide Inc.; PepsiCo Inc.; Procter & Gamble Co.; Pure Storage Inc.; Qualcomm Inc.; Replacements Ltd.; Salesforce; SAP America Inc.; Sodexo Inc.; Symantec Corp.; T-Mobile USA Inc.; Target Corp.; Tech Data Corp.; TIAA; Twitter Inc.; Uber Technologies Inc.; Unilever; Warby Parker; Wedding Wire Inc.; Williams-Sonoma Inc.; and Xerox Corp. “Fairness and equality are core American values. But millions of LGBT Americans are still viewed as less than equal in the eyes of the law today,” said Cicilline. “I’m proud to introduce the Equality Act of 2017 with Senator Jeff Merkley. This bill ensures that every LGBT person can live their lives free from the fear of discrimination. Above all, it’s about honoring the values that have guided our nation since its founding. It’s critical that Congress pass the Equality Act into law.” “For far too long, the door of discrimination has been slammed shut on LGBTQ Americans,” added Senator Merkley. “It’s been slammed shut on equality, it’s been slammed shut on opportunity, and this must end. It’s time to have the Equality Act on the floor of the House and the floor of the Senate for a full debate.” “We cannot grow complacent in the quest for equal rights for all.  Every day it is evident that we still have work to do.  Basic constitutional human rights must be protected in every state,” LGBT Equality Caucus Co-Chair Jared Polis said.  “The Equality Act will finally give all LGBTQ Americans protections from discrimination. Equal rights are what sustain us as a unified nation, as the land of the free, and as an example for the entire world.” Despite significant advances, LGBT people across the country remain vulnerable to discrimination on a daily basis and too often have little recourse. With the advent of nationwide marriage equality, in many states, same-sex couples have the right to marry but have no explicit non-discrimination protections. In most states, this means that a same-sex couple could legally marry one day and risk being fired from their jobs, evicted from their apartment, or kicked out of a restaurant the next. The Equality Act ensures that the same protections already extended to other protected classes are equally available to LGBT Americans. It amends existing federal civil rights laws to explicitly prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity in education, employment, housing, credit, Federal jury service, public accommodations, and the use of Federal funds. In some of these areas, federal law prohibiting sex discrimination has already been properly interpreted by federal courts and administrative agencies to include discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. The Equality Act affirms that understanding of existing law and makes the prohibition against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity explicit, in order to provide greater clarity to members of the public, employers, schools, businesses and other affected parties. In areas where sex discrimination is not already prohibited, the bill amends existing law to bar discrimination on the basis of sex, as well as sexual orientation, and gender identity. Cicilline, who also led the introduction of the Equality Act of 2015, introduced the proposal today with more co-sponsors than ever before in the U.S. House. Today also marks the first time that the bill is being introduced as a bipartisan proposal in the House. The full text of the Equality Act can be viewed by clicking here.

KUALA LUMPUR, May 4 — In our previous article, we looked at what it takes to drive the knowledge-driven economy from a helicopter view.   In today’s article we will be focusing on how businesses can leverage on their intellectual property (IP) in transforming their business model.  More often than not, businesses spend significant time or money on their creation without thoroughly evaluating it for commercial potential, including considering all of its advantages and disadvantages.  In order to leverage on your technology, you need to know yourself. When I mention “know yourself”, I am referring to your business model. It is pivotal to have a clear understanding of your business model and identify the strengths and weaknesses of your business concept.  There are a few key ingredients that businesses need to know when developing a strong business concept and value propositions which will open doors to greater commercial opportunities such as licensing, franchising, alliance and collaborations or even divestments and spin-offs.  How does a company set about focusing the business dimension of its IP management? Although a full answer to this question requires some complex analyses, a good starting point is to think in terms of this simple three-step process:  Define what your company expects to gain from the management of its IP Determine the specific roles IP can play in support of your company’s business Select and pursue a basic IP strategy to meet these objectives Assembling a team with a good composition of technical, legal, marketing and key management personnel would be a good starting point to develop a well-considered business expansion plan.  In many organisations, the R&D, strategy, and legal functions are poorly integrated. Consequently, firms miss out on opportunities to create and exploit the value of intellectual property.  Functional silos are one reason arising from the lack of integration. More importantly, the lack of a common framework and even language that would allow engineers, lawyers, and business executives to manage IP assets better is a common problem.  At this stage, the team needs to identify their organisation objectives and align it with their intellectual property strategy. Once this has been crafted, the next step is the formation of a good IP strategy.  The IP strategy will be the crux of the business model that will drive organisation to the desired monetisation avenue.  The formation of an IP strategy will start off with what is to be protected within the said technology, product or services. It is very important to know your technology/product/services by dissecting the strengths and weaknesses for your creation.  Once this is identified, you need to identify the countries for your business concept and market information gathering such as market size, market share and market readiness.  This will help to develop appropriate tactics to penetrate the market. Did you know that a technology or product may consist of more than one type of IP protection?  A thorough study needs to be made in order to have the best IP protection for your creation as this will be a good strategy when you tackle competition.  The next element that is very crucial is the cost structure of the technology, product or services and its business legality for the various markets identified.  This factor is often overlooked due to the lack of market screening and customer acceptance. Price analysis should be conducted to develop a sound cost structure which is feasible to be adopted in various stages of the business cycle.  Once this has been achieved, businesses should strategise their exploitation models which could comprise one or more of the following models: Outright sale Donation/publication License Joint venture or alliance Reduce competitive threat Incorporation into existing business Create a new business The common trend that I notice in the Malaysian business landscape is that businesses tend to use their IP for defensive purposes only.  Their goals are to protect their own innovations, to ensure that they don’t infringe the IP of others, and to obtain more IP.  The costs in filing fees, enforcement and other legal expenses can be high. Another common approach is cost-control level where companies at this level still have a defensive approach, but now focus on finding ways to obtain protection while simultaneously minimising the costs of creating and maintaining their IP.  Many innovative companies fall into the integrated or visionary level. At integrated level, the company’s business units have grasped the power of using IP for a range of business roles.  The IP is used for business and becomes integrated across all of the company’s business activity. An interesting example is the Procter & Gamble Company (P&G) that revolutionised the at-home market when it introduced Crest Whitestrips, offering consumers a cheaper method to whiten their teeth.  P&G patented the strips, an adhesive material that guaranteed the whitening agent would remain in contact with the teeth for an extended period of time.  The cleverly designed patenting strategy made it close to impossible to invent around P&G’s product. Because the new product complimented the Crest brand more generally, P&G gained market share broadly across its oral care products.  At the visionary level of IP management sophistication, companies take a long-term view of the company’s role in business and in its industry.  They seek to use the company’s IP to create more strategic value. Visionary companies have IP portfolios that cover not only current products, but technologies that anticipate where the market will be in the future.  As for Google, it has become so huge and powerful where it has changed the paradigm of sharing information.  Once you have decided on your IP strategy and the ownership, allocate your resources and execute it. There is a life cycle to every intellectual property right and technology.  The management of IP is all about handling innovation with the procedures and processes that are required to turn that innovation into valuable rights.   An organisation without a clear IP direction is similar to a blind man without his cane.  * Biruntha Mooruthi is Vice President and Head of IPR Services of PlaTCOM Ventures Sdn Bhd, the national technology commercialisation platform of Malaysia—a wholly-owned subsidiary company of Agensi Inovasi Malaysia (AIM) formed in collabouration with SME Corp Malaysia.                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Model under fire for posing nude in latest Instagram trend Wolves return to Denmark for first time in 200 years ‘Flawless’ heart-shaped diamond highlights Geneva auction Egypt’s mannequin makers feel the pinch Human noise pollution is everywhere, risks animals’ survival in the wild Adorable Maori toddler does the Haka, owns the Internet (VIDEO) Celebrities embrace avant-garde challenge at 2017 Met Gala (VIDEO) This picture cost a US Army photographer her life Meet Ayumi Hamasaki’s yoga ‘sensei’ Praise Allah!

Addressing an annual press conference of his Patanjali brand of consumer goods, Ramdev told the media that India should "follow Israel's cue and behead 100, if they decapitate even one or two of our soldiers". Baba Ramdev. PTI file image "I have seen the relatives of those soldiers crying and asking why my child's body was mutilated," he said. India has accused the Pakistani army of Monday's killing and mutilation of two Indian soldiers on the Line of Control. Continuing in the same vein, he referred to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and said "patriotism is in his blood and he won't flinch from following his duty". On his brand Patanjali, Ramdev said by next year the homegrown label will have a production capacity of Rs 60,000 crore. Presently, he said, it is Rs 30,000 crore. He said that Chinese products "must be boycotted", and cited the boycotting of foreign goods called for by Mahatma Gandhi and Chandrashekhar Azad during British rule.
