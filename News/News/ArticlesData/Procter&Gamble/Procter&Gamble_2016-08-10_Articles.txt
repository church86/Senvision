"Following" : "Follow"}} August 11, 2016 5:08pm   Comments Share: Related PG Benzinga's Top Initiations Wall Street's M&A Chatter From November 11-13 P&G caught in river rights feud (Seeking Alpha) Deutsche Bank's Bill Schmitz commented on Procter and Gamble's (NYSE: PG) new turnaround strategy, while taking back market share and re-strengthening its core brands. The analyst maintained his Buy rating and $95 price target. "After several years of organic growth disappointments and relative under performance, company is taking off the kid gloves and aggressively reinvesting across brands, categories, countries and channels to get things moving in the right direction," said Schmitz. The Deutsche Bank analyst cited category growth improvements, margin enhancements driven by volume growth and guidance for providing "plenty of cushion" making Proctor and Gamble "a relative winner, boosting earnings growth and multiple." After meeting with management, Schmitz thought Procter and Gamble was putting in significant effort to have a balance between growth and profitability. The Deutsche Bank analyst added, "Our take away, reading between the lines, is that this is the year company is going to make up for lost time, investing aggressively in advertising, innovation, channels and sales coverage to get the top line moving again, armed with $0.50 or more of earnings cushion relative to guidance to make the magic happen again." Throwback to 2001 Shmitz thought the strategy "smelled" a lot like 2001-2004 when Proctor and Gamble went on its "last innovation and marketing driven land grab which was also, not surprisingly, the last time the company grew well above peers and the stock relatively outperformed the group." Shmitz is among the best analyst's covering Proctor and Gamble with a 78 percent success rate and a +12.5 percent average return per recommendation. The analyst is ranked 63 out of 4110 analysts. Proctor and Gamble traded at $86.73, up 0.49 percent Thursday.

Targeted Ads Procter & Gamble announced yesterday the company has decided to scale back on their targeted Facebook advertisements, citing limited effectiveness. The world's largest ad buyer will not cut back on the overall funding for Facebook advertisements, but instead will reduce the number of targeted ad buys. “We targeted too much, and we went too narrow,” Marc Pritchard, chief financial officer at P&G, said to The Wall Street Journal, “and now we're looking at: What is the best way to get the most reach but also the right precision?” “Facebook has been one of our first and most consistent partners,” a spokesperson at P&G said to DMN. “Facebook offers both mass reach with precision targeting and our brands will continue to use Facebook to reach consumer, including targeting where it makes sense.” However, this scale back in advertisement should not be perceived as a failure by either company, according to Joshua Backer, Co-Founder and President of Advertising at Unified. “P&G did what a smart marketer should do: test and learn based on results,” said Backer to DMN. “Highly segmented targeting on all campaigned and investments was a sound hypothesis, but the data did not support hyper-segmentation across the board.” Facebook's ad platform has evolved over time, offering advertisers more opportunity to get granular in who they reach and track the efficacy of their ads. Key milestones include interest targeting (launched in 2007) and its partnership with Datalogix, which helped advertisers track whether ads led to offline purchases (launched in 2012). “Our partnership with P&G grows every year in service of effect and efficient advertising,” a Facebook spokeswoman said to DMN. “We learn from each other and iterate. That has always been the spirit of how we work together and challenge one another.” P&G also said that it would cut back on spending on publisher websites, citing a lack of reach in comparison to the social media behemoth. Facebook had an average of 1.13 billion daily active users and 1.71 monthly active users in June, according to the company's website. This shift underscores the uneasy relationship between Facebook and publishers, who depend on Facebook's referral of free traffic while the company courts ad revenue from legacy advertisers like P&G. In 2012, General Motors announced that it would stop advertising on Facebook, citing poor performance. The news resulted in a slight dip in Facebook's stock as it was the first time a major brand publicly questioned the value of Facebook advertising. The company returned the next year. The timing of P&G's announcement cannot be ignored though, as the same day Facebook revealed plans to launch a digital program that will render the functionality of ad blockers useless. “We've designed our ad formats, ad performance and controls to address the underlying reasons people to ad blocking software,” said a Facebook press release. “Rather than paying ad blocking companies to unblock the ads we show - as some of the companies have invited us to do in the past - we're putting the control in people's hands with our updated ad preferences and our other advertising controls.” This program will also create more online ad space for Facebook, which pulled in $17.08 billion in ad revenue last year.

By DC Velocity Staff Comment Managing a team of more than 60,000 supply chain employees for the Illinois-based, global food and beverage conglomerate Mondelēz International might seem like an intimidating job. For Daniel Myers, however, the position is a logical next step in a long and distinguished career. Prior to his current position, he led business units at Procter & Gamble Co. (P&G) for 33 years. He's also worked in more than four dozen countries ... so far. His accomplishments include integrating Gillette's global supply chain after it was acquired by P&G in 2005 and helping to create an efficient, snack-focused supply chain at Mondelēz when Kraft Foods Inc. created the company by spinning off its North American grocery operations in 2012. As executive vice president for integrated supply chain, Myers has earned a reputation for developing the next generation of supply chain professionals and managers. Myers received his Bachelor of Science degree in chemical engineering from the University of Tennessee and serves on the board of the Global Supply Chain Institute at the university's Haslam College of Business. For this profile, Myers answered seven questions about his life experiences and lessons learned from four decades of leadership in the global supply chain. Q: What's your proudest professional achievement, and why? A: I've had the blessing and privilege to do so much in my career, but the greatest thing is to get a group of people to do the extraordinary together and achieve what they did not think was possible. [For example,] we are currently reinventing the entire supply chain for our company, for every region and every category. We have committed to save $3 billion in gross savings over two years—$1.5 billion net—taken out of COGS (the cost of goods sold). Q: You've worked for decades in logistics and supply chain at Procter & Gamble, Kraft, and now Mondelēz International. What first drew you to this profession? A: I started in engineering, then moved to manufacturing, customer service, and procurement, so I've been exposed to different functions in the value chain. That continuous flow of getting products into consumers' hands is what makes a business succeed or fail. I have worked in 49 countries around the world now; it's exciting. Q: What are some of the biggest changes you've seen during your career? A: I have seen us move in the industry from a siloed [view] to sharing information. We call my division the "integrated supply chain" because breaking down divisions is the secret to business success. We've got to be consumer-driven and optimize the total value chain to succeed, moving from silos to a focus on common metrics. The Information Age allows you to do that. Q: What hasn't changed? A: The focus on having leaders of integrity who can build trust and "followership." You can sense when you have a great leader because people want to be there. That's true for all generations; Millennials want to work for something greater than money—they want to work for something they're proud of. Q: What are some of the truisms that should be forgotten? In other words, what rules do companies need to break? A: Each of us has the tendency to look at ourselves in the mirror, but when you look through the window first, at whoever is best in the world, then [your own] reflection looks different. We looked at who is best in safety, and that was DuPont. They're not in the food business, but they had the best standard, so we aimed for that. And we would not have dropped our injury rate by threefold if we had just continued to improve by our own measure. Maybe that comparison will make you uncomfortable, but it creates a level of dissatisfaction, and your rate of improvement is directly proportional to your level of dissatisfaction. Q: You are known for nurturing and developing supply chain leadership.What advice would you give someone just starting a career in supply chain management? A: No one's going to remember what you do in your own career. What people remember is what you're done to nurture their growth and development. Learning agility—the ability to learn and grow over your lifetime—is really what sets apart people who make a difference. As you learn you develop mastery, then you can pass that knowledge on to others. Q: What attributes do you look for when recruiting someone to your team? A: Integrity. Personal drive to be the best. Learning agility. Capacity. Raw talent. Intelligence. Capability. #Professional Development #Supply Chain Management #Logistics Resources Mentioned In This Article Mondelez International Procter & Gamble University of Tennessee Related Articles Survey: Consumers demand blend of online and in-store shopping options Shopify integrates with Shyp for outsourced fulfillment Bennett International launches transportation logistics firm Logistics gives back NRF sweeps into NYC on Jan. 15 More Videos » Strategy Videos MHI – now and in the future.

But maybe there is a downside to such microtargeting. P&G CMO Marc Pritchard told the WSJ:  “We targeted too much, and we went too narrow,” he said in an interview, “and now we're looking at: What is the best way to get the most reach but also the right precision?” It's hard to not read this as a failure of Facebook advertising account management - that team should be the one guiding large advertisers like P&G through the right mix. But, separately, maybe a CPG like P&G has done mass marketing for a reason. No amount of social media posts are going to alert any company when someone is in the market for dish detergent. Here's Facebook's statement to DMN: "Our partnership with P&G grows every year in service of effective and efficient advertising. We learn from each other and iterate. That has always been the spirit of how we work together and challenge one another. The cornerstone of our ad strategy is a mix of mass reach and personalized targeting that lends well to mobile consumption and is a strong complement to TV. Our clients tell us this strategy works because we can deliver relevant marketing to the right audiences, with unprecedented scale. It enables partners like P&G to drive the business metrics they care about.” * This blog post previously implied P&G was cutting back on Facebook advertising. It is scaling back targeted advertising but planning to keep its overall spend the same. DMNotes is DMN's around-the-clock blog. Yes, a blog in 2016.

The Cincinnati-based consumer goods company said it will scale back its targeted ads on Facebook. Considered the biggest advertising spender in the world, P&G said the targeted ads were producing limited revenue for the company. P&G still plans to maintain advertisements on Facebook, but it will use targeted ads only where it makes sense. The company has recently increased spending on both websites and traditional platforms. P&G spent about $8.3 billion on global advertising this year, down eight percent year-over-year. The company plans to increase its advertising spending by five percent for the year that started on July 1.

Un trend che sembra emergere tra i big spender di Sharon Terlep - traduzione di Giorgia Crespi Scarica il pdf Condividi su FacebookCondividi su TwitterCondividi via emailCondividi su Google+Condividi su LinkedinCondividi su WhatsApp Commenta Stampa Riduci carattere Ingrandisci carattere Vota 0 Voti Procter&Gamble, primo spender pubblicitario al mondo, prenderà le distanze dagli annunci pubblicitari su Facebook che mirano a un pubblico specifico dopo aver verificato che la pratica ha un’efficacia limitata. Il social network di Mark Zuckerberg ha impiegato anni a sviluppare la capacità di concentrarsi sui consumatori sulla base di dati demografici, abitudini di acquisto e avvenimenti importanti della vita di ognuno. P&G, leader nel settore casalinghi con prodotti del calibro di Pampers, inizialmente ha colto al volo l’opportunità di organizzare direttamente l’attività di marketing in base a sottocategorie di acquirenti, dagli adolescenti ai neoproprietari di case. Marc Pritchard, chief marketing officer della multinazionale di Cincinnati, ha rivelato che l’azienda ritiene di essersi spinta troppo oltre con questa strategia. «Abbiamo esagerato con il targeting e abbiamo ristretto eccessivamente il campo», ha ammesso in un’intervista, «e ora stiamo valutando il modo migliore per ottenere la massima presa, ma anche la giusta precisione». Pritchard ha precisato che P&G non rinuncerà completamente all’investimento su Facebook e impiegherà annunci mirati nei casi in cui lo riterrà sensato, come per esempio indirizzare la promozione dei pannolini alle mamme in attesa. La spesa è stata intensificata sia sul digitale sia sulle piattaforme tradizionali. La sterzata di P&G evidenzia i limiti di questo genere di targeting per i grandi marchi, uno dei capisaldi del business pubblicitario di Menlo Park. Il social network può imporre prezzi più elevati con il marketing mirato: più è circoscritto il bersaglio, più è costoso l’annuncio. P&G potrebbe essere l’indicatore principale del trend nella pubblicità digitale dell’industria dei beni di consumo e i big brand. Nel corso dell’ultimo anno i player di questa industria hanno identificato il bisogno di ampliare il pubblico nella pubblicità sui siti dei social media, spiega James Douglas, direttore esecutivo dell’agenzia di social media Society di Interpublic Group. Secondo Douglas i casi di studio dimostrano che le aziende possono realizzare un più consistente aumento delle vendite se raggiungono una quota più significativa del pubblico generale di una piattaforma. Per esempio, due anni fa P&G ha sperimentato gli annunci mirati con il deodorante per ambiente Febreze, puntando sui proprietari di animali domestici e le famiglie numerose. Durante l’esperimento è stata riscontrata una stagnazione delle vendite, che sono migliorate quando lo spettro della campagna è stato ampliato per includere tutti i soggetti maggiori di diciotto anni. A sentire la portavoce di Facebook, la partnership con P&G «cresce ogni anno», e le due imparano l’una dall’altra. Facebook ha iniziato a lavorare al sistema di targetizzazione delle inserzioni nel 2007, quando era ancora una startup con tre anni di vita e meno di 60 milioni di utenti attivi. Allora, la piattaforma di marketing era costituita dalle pagine gratuite attraverso le quali le aziende potevano promuovere il prodotto mentre ora, con un’utenza mensile composta da 1,7 miliardi di persone, lo scorso anno ha messo a segno 17,08 miliardi di dollari di entrate pubblicitarie, un incremento del 49% anno su anno. I pubblicitari possono individuare il target di riferimento con precisione. I candidati politici possono concentrarsi sulla base dei distretti congressuali, le catene di ristoranti possono lanciare campagne per gli amanti del cibo piccante e le aziende di traslochi possono intercettare chi ha in programma un trasferimento in un’altra casa. «Se è possibile fare un’inserzione e raggiungere un milione di persone o fare un annuncio mirato per raggiungerne 5.000, i rendimenti su queste 5.000 devono essere davvero notevoli perché ne valga la pena», riflette Peter Daboll, amministratore delegato di Ace Metrix, che testa l’efficacia degli annunci e collabora con Facebook. Nell’ultimo esercizio P&G ha destinato circa 7,2 miliardi di dollari alla pubblicità in tutto il mondo, un rialzo dell’1% rispetto all’anno precedente. Inoltre ha messo in conto una maggiorazione del 5% circa per quest’anno. Prima del leggero incremento degli ultimi dodici mesi, aveva tagliato la spesa per due anni di fila. La spinta verso l’ampliamento della focalizzazione pubblicitaria si evince anche dai recenti aumenti nella spesa televisiva. Stando a indiscrezioni, verso la fine dello scorso anno P&G ha iniziato a ridestinare risorse alla televisione. Durante il primo trimestre l’investimento nella pubblicità ha registrato un balzo dell’11% a 429 milioni di dollari rispetto all’anno precedente (dati Kantar Media). Per molti dei grandi inserzionisti, gli strumenti di targeting sponsorizzati da Facebook sono un limite, riflette Brian Weiser di Pivotal Research. «Più grande è il brand, più ampia deve essere la presa e i media meno mirati», sottolinea. Il targeting è di primaria importanza per i soggetti che mirano a convincere gli utenti a scaricare un’app di gioco o per una piccola impresa che vuole attirare la clientela locale.

Procter & Gamble also comes in above the median of analyst picks among the broader S&P 500 index components, claiming the #204 spot out of 500. In forming this rank, the analyst opinions from the major brokerage houses were tallied, and averaged; then, the underlying components were ranked according to those averages. Investors often interpret analyst opinions from different angles — a popular analyst pick could mean that many sharp minds individually came to the same bullish conclusion, and therefore the stock should do well, but it could also mean that if the company stumbles, that would come as a negative surprise.

It can, of course, but a bullish investor could also take the contrarian angle and read into the data that there is lots of room for upside because the stock is so out of favor. 9 Stocks to Buy That Will Sprint Past Everything Else For these reasons, we at ETF Channel find value to putting together these rankings, because both the top and the bottom ends of the lists can often make for some interesting stock picking ideas for further research.

August 10, 2016 8:51am Nasdaq:FB NYSE:PG ShareTweet Consumer products giant Procter & Gamble Co (NYSE:PG) recently said it would spend less money on targeted ads on Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB), citing limited effectiveness of the campaigns. Now investors are scrambling to determine whether the move is a sign that Facebook’s explosive ad revenues are topping, or if P&G’s decision is simply a one-off event that the social media giant will take in stride. From the Wall Street Journal: Procter & Gamble Co., the biggest advertising spender in the world, will move away from ads on Facebook that target specific consumers, concluding that the practice has limited effectiveness. Facebook Inc. has spent years developing its ability to zero in on consumers based on demographics, shopping habits and life milestones. P&G, the maker of myriad household goods including Tide and Pampers, initially jumped at the opportunity to market directly to subsets of shoppers, from teenage shavers to first-time homeowners. Marc Pritchard, P&G’s chief marketing officer, said the company has realized it took the strategy too far. “We targeted too much, and we went too narrow,” he said in an interview, “and now we’re looking at: What is the best way to get the most reach but also the right precision?” While P&G isn’t actually spending less money on Facebook’s platform, targeted ads usually cost significantly more money than wider-reaching ads. Thus, FB will likely be getting a lower amount per ad from the world’s largest advertiser. Procter & Gamble’s brands include household names like Tide detergent, Bounty paper towels, Pampers diapers, and many more. If other big companies begin to follow P&G’s lead, Facebook’s targeted ads — which have been a cornerstone of its meteoric revenue growth — could face significant pressure. That would mean a leveling off or perhaps even a decline in revenue per page. Plenty of other advertisers will continue to use Facebook’s targeting out of necessity — think local political ads, car dealerships, etc. But it may be that national brands just don’t see the returns from targeting specific user types than originally hoped. While P&G pulls back on targeting, companies like Priceline and others are actually ramping up. Their results in doing so help determine the fate of Facebook’s ad platform at large. Facebook shares were mostly flat in premarket trading Wednesday at $125.03. FB has gained 19.5% year-to-date, more than doubling the performance of the S&P 500 index in the same period.

O Facebook passou anos aprimorando sua capacidade de selecionar consumidores em sua rede social baseado em fatores demográficos, hábitos de compra e acontecimentos marcantes na vida dos usuários. A P&G, fabricante do detergente Tide e das fraldas Pampers, incialmente abraçou a oportunidade de direcionar seus anúncios para grupos particulares, desde mulheres grávidas até proprietários do primeiro imóvel. Marc Pritchard, diretor de marketing da P&G, diz que a empresa americana concluiu que a estratégia foi longe demais. “Miramos demais e afunilamos demais”, disse ele numa entrevista ao The Wall Street Journal, “e agora estamos perguntando: Qual a melhor maneira de ter o maior alcance, mas também a precisão correta?” Pritchard diz que a P&G não vai cortar seus gastos no Facebook e vai continuar usando publicidade direcionada quando fizer sentido, como anunciar fraldas para grávidas. Ele diz que a empresa aumentou seus gastos tanto na internet como em plataformas mais tradicionais. A empresa, porém, reduziu a publicidade em sites menores, que não têm o alcance de gigantes como Facebook, Google e YouTube. De forma mais geral, a mudança promovida pela P&G ressalta os limites da publicidade direcionada de grandes marcas, um dos pilares do negócio do Facebook. Dois anos atrás, por exemplo, a P&G tentou direcionar os anúncios de seu spray aromatizante Frebreze para donos de animais de estimação e famílias numerosas. As vendas da marca ficaram estagnadas durante a campanha, mas aumentaram a partir de março, quando ela foi expandida no Facebook e outros veículos para qualquer pessoa com mais de 18 anos. Uma porta-voz do Facebook diz que a parceria da rede social com a P&G “fica maior a cada ano” e que as duas empresas aprendem uma com a outra. O Facebook começou a trabalhar num sistema de publicidade direcionada em 2007, quando ainda era uma “startup” deficitária de três anos de idade e sua rede social tinha só 60 milhões de usuários ativos. Na época, a principal plataforma de marketing do Facebook eram páginas gratuitas onde as empresas promoviam seus produtos. Desde então, o Facebook se tornou uma plataforma de marketing de dimensões notáveis. No ano passado, a empresa americana faturou US$ 17,08 bilhões com publicidade, 49% a mais que em 2014, aproveitando o desejo dos anunciantes de alcançar os seus agora 1,7 bilhão de usuários ativos mensais. No Facebook, os anunciantes podem selecionar o alvo de suas propagandas com precisão. Políticos disputando eleições, por exemplo, podem se focar nos eleitores de seu distrito, redes de restaurantes podem promover campanhas para os amantes de comidas apimentadas e empresas de mudança podem encontrar internautas que “muito provavelmente” vão se mudar. “Se você pode publicar um anúncio e atingir um milhão de pessoas ou direcionar outro só para 5 mil, você tem que ter um retorno expressivo no de 5 mil para que ele valha a pena”, diz Peter Daboll, diretor-presidente da Ace Metrix, firma que mede a eficácia de anúncios e trabalha com o Facebook. A P&G, que é sediada em Cincinnati, no Estado americano de Ohio, gastou aproximadamente US$ 8,3 bilhões com publicidade no mundo todo durante o ano fiscal encerrado em junho de 2015, 8% menos que no ano anterior, segundo documentos públicos da empresa. A P&G afirma que elevou os gastos com publicidade em 1% no seu ano fiscal recém-terminado e que pretende aumentá-los em cerca de 5% no ano corrente, iniciado em 1º de julho. O esforço da P&G para encontrar uma audiência mais ampla para seus anúncios também fica evidente nos aumentos recentes que a empresa fez em seus gastos com propagandas na televisão, dizem pessoas a par do assunto. Próximo do fim do ano passado, a empresa começou a transferir uma fatia maior do orçamento de volta para a televisão, dizem as fontes. Durante o primeiro trimestre deste ano, os gastos com anúncios saltaram 11% em relação ao mesmo período de 2015, para US$ 429 milhões, afirma a Kantar Media, que monitora gastos com publicidade das empresas. Para muitos dos maiores anunciantes do mundo, as ferramentas de publicidade direcionada oferecidas pelo Facebook não são tão atraentes assim, diz Brian Weiser, analista da firma de pesquisa Pivotal Research. “Quanto maior a sua marca, mais você precisa de um alcance maior e menos de mídia direcionada”, diz ele. Propaganda para grupos específicos é vital, por exemplo, para anunciantes tentando convencer usuários a baixar um aplicativo de videogame ou para pequenas empresas tentando atrair clientes locais. O Facebook começou a oferecer novas ferramentas especificamente para grandes anunciantes, inclusive uma maneira de aumentar a exposição da marca ao mostrar anúncios para pessoas mais propensas a prestar atenção neles. O ponto principal da estratégia de publicidade do Facebook é uma mistura de alcance de massa e personalização, o que é adequado ao consumo via aparelhos móveis e é um forte complemento para a TV, diz a porta-voz do Facebook. E nem todos os grandes anunciantes estão reduzindo sua publicidade direcionada no Facebook. A empresa de viagens Priceline Group Inc., por exemplo, planeja elevar seus gastos com esse tipo de anúncios. “Concluímos que algumas coisas que fizemos no Facebook funcionaram bem”, diz o diretor-presidente Jeffrey Boyd.

SmartCommerce provides unique, brand-focused solutions that help build brand-customer connections in the rapidly changing CPG marketplace. Related Media Products, not experience, drive Millennials to online shopping Consumer expectations are driving rapid and exciting change in the retail environment. Omnichannel, always-on shopping behavior is increasingly becoming the norm, and technology solutions like buy online pick-up in store (BOPIS), Instacart and AmazonFresh are taking off because they are tailored to meet the needs of today’s "omnishoppers.” The key is that shopping behaviors including product discovery, selection and ordering are no longer discrete activities that only occur in stores; they are integrated into everyday life. Run out of mayonnaise while making a sandwich? Quickly drop that into your online shopping cart while you’re thinking about it. See an ad for new storage bags that would be perfect for sending your kids to camp? Click to buy them now. Discover a great mixer at a party? Don’t try to remember it the next time you go to the store — add it to your Instacart list on your smartphone. That’s “omnishopping,” and based on our research, it’s happening across all demographics and geographies. The old paradigm depended on brand target customers remembering the products they wanted during weekly shopping trips, but the omnishopper model rewards brands and retailers who bring the store to the shopper. This is achieved by keeping a cart close by at all times to “catch” impulse buys as they occur throughout the day. Delighting omnishoppers requires a new cooperation between brands and retailers, which may initially seem uncomfortable to both until they realize they’re leaving their old school competitors in the dust. Brands drive most of the out-of-store discovery of their product through marketing efforts like ads, social media, public relations and so on; each of these digital touchpoints should be cart-enabled, with direct connections to the retailers most relevant to each individual shopper. Retailers make up the fulfillment part of the process and should make this process as frictionless as possible. They can find ways to make it super easy for shoppers to collect products digitally, and receive them how/when it best fits their needs from numerous options like local delivery, curbside pickup or subscription box deliveries. Omnishopper nirvana is when shoppers feel almost like they just have to think about wanting a product and it’s dropped in a cart for them, and that products seem to magically appear in their lives at just the right time. With smartphones, new IoT tools and emerging B2B services, we have the technology to make this a reality. Expect to see the brands and retailers who drive this change get disproportionately rewarded.

Banco Popolare: precisazione su notizie stampa Comunicato della Banca Popolare di Milano In primo piano P&G, meno pubblicità su Facebook –di Marco Valsania 11 agosto 2016 Facebook, il re della pubblicità digitale assieme a Google, subisce la defezione del leader mondiale assoluto nelle inserzioni, Procter & Gamble. Una defezione relativa: il big dei prodotti di largo consumo ha deciso che tirerà i remi in barca sugli “spot” dedicati a specifici consumatori, che le sue ricerche hanno dichiarato inefficaci, mantenendo però invariata la voce del budget destinata al social network. Ma è un ritiro che scotta ugualmente: mette in discussone uno dei principali pilastri dell’appeal di Facebook per i grandi marchi, i rivoluzionari strumenti sviluppati dal 2007 in avanti con l’obiettivo di raggiungere audience sempre più segmentate per abitudini, gusti, caratteristiche demografiche e quant’altro. Peccato, ha sentenziato ora P&G dall’alto di una spesa mondiale in pubblicità di oltre 7 miliardi l’anno, che questa articolata “piattaforma” non funzioni affatto così facilmente, nè per pannolini e sapone da bucato, nè per i rasoi o le necessità dei neoproprietari di case. «Troppo targeting e un focus troppo ristretto», ha commentato il responsabile del marketing di P&G al Wall Street Journal. Svelando, forse, segreti di Pulcinella gelosamente custoditi dai colossi della new economy: non è tutto automaticamente trasformabile in oro ciò che luccica sull’autostrada elettronica. Ed eccedere nei social media può far male anche a chi vuole coltivare con intelligenza i cittadini nei panni di consumatori. L’interrogativo, per Pritchard e P&G, riguarda così oggi la ricerca di un inedito ed elusivo equilibrio in strategie tuttora in evoluzione sui new media: «Come avere sia il maggior raggio d’azione possibile che la corretta precisione». Perchè, pur con tutti i dubbi e le necessarie correzioni di rotta, Fb alla stregua di Google con la sua espansione è ormai diventato un ineludibile canale pubblicitario per la Corporate America: con i suoi 1,7 miliardi di utenti al mondo genera una raccolta annuale di 17,04 miliardi di dollari (+49% in un anno). «La nostra partnership con P&G - precisa in una nota Facebook - cresce ogni anno nell'offerta di servizi di advertising efficienti ed efficaci. I nostri clienti ci dicono che questa strategia funziona perché siamo in grado di fornire al pubblico giusto la pubblicità giusta, in una scala senza precedenti». © Riproduzione riservata Argomenti: Pubblicità 0 commenti Partecipa alla discussione Annulla Disclaimer Pubblica 0 Commenti | Aggiorna Vedi tutti i commenti Carica altri commenti I più letti di Finanza & Mercati Ultime novità Dal catalogo del Sole 24 Ore Scopri altri prodotti Le gallery più viste Motori24 16 novembre 2016 Alfa Romeo Stelvio, tutte le foto del debutto a Los Angeles Motori24 19 novembre 2016 Jeep Compass, tutte le foto della seconda generazione Motori24 16 novembre 2016 Alfa Romeo Stelvio, ecco le foto del primo suv del biscione Motori24 7 novembre 2016 Eicma 2016, le foto delle moto al debutto Motori24 17 novembre 2016 L'improbabile megasuv con i gradini per entrare Foto 15 Luxury 23 novembre 2016 La Sicilia del buon gusto, 15 tappe con le Soste di Ulisse 32 Luxury 23 novembre 2016 Il grand opening di Palazzo Versace Hotel & Resort a Dubai 11 Arte 23 novembre 2016 Chris Ware: Il Palazzo della Memoria.

Bachelder, has built her career on being a different sort of leader. In early June 2016 Bachelder discussed her views on leadership, business, faith and more with Religion & Liberty’s Sarah Stanley at the Popeyes’ headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia. Bachelder has a long list of accomplishments. She’s currently the CEO of Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen, which she joined in November 2007 after serving as an active member of the company’s board for a year. At Popeyes, she promptly established a “Road Map for Results that focused on four key tenets of growing a restaurant chain: build a distinctive brand, run great restaurants, grow restaurant profits and ramp up new unit growth.” Before joining Popeyes, Bachelder was president and chief concept officer for KFC Corporate, and before that she served as vice president of marketing and product development for Domino’s Pizza. Prior to her restaurant experience, Bachelder served as general manager of the LifeSavers Division of RJR Nabisco. Her early career years included brand management roles at Gillett and Procter & Gamble. She is the author of Dare to Serve: How to Drive Superior Results by Serving Others (Berrett-Koehler 2015). Bachelder holds a Bachelor of Science degree in Business Administration and a Master of Business Administration in Finance and Marketing from the Kelley School of Business at Indiana University. R&L: When you took over the helm of the troubled Popeyes organization, you worked hard to restore trust with franchisees, many of whom felt that they’d been let down by the company. How did you begin that process? Cheryl A. Bachelder: Well, the company is 35 years old. So it’s been here a long time. A franchisee signs a 20-year contract to represent our brand, so it’s a very long-view investment for them and for their families. In the seven years prior to my arrival, they had met four different CEOs. There had been a lot of turnover in the role. And I was just another one. Their first look at me was, “Well, what’s so great about you?” It so quickly became evident that I had a lot of work to do to restore any kind of trust and credibility with them that would allow me to lead. Trust always begins by one thing: listening. One of the other execs and I went on a seven-city listening tour. We had small group meetings with our franchise owners, our restaurant general managers and our customers. And we just took notes. It took us about three weeks to get to all seven cities and absorb all the feedback. But I think that’s the key—to not assume you know. And also that you never forget that the people closest to the business actually do know what’s going on. It’s a way to demonstrate respect, that their input’s valuable, and they do have some ideas they’d like to share about how to turn the business around. So we collected all that input and those ideas, and that’s where we began to form a thesis about our business plan, where we should put our attention, what needed to change in what order. We created the Roadmap for Results, a one-page summary of the goals and strategies we would pursue to turn the company around. But we didn’t just start doing it. We went back on the road and did town hall meetings in multiple cities to give people a chance to look at our thinking and to test it and say, “Does that ring true? Is that what you were trying to tell us? Is that a plan you could be excited about?” In your book, Dare to Serve: How to Create Superior Results by Serving Others, you talk a lot about solving problems and managing with a fact-based approach. It’s been said that not everything one measures is important and not everything important can be measured. Do metrics have a limit to their usefulness in managing a large corporation? I suppose you can measure too much and confuse the organization by having so many measures that nobody knows what’s important. But in our company we’ve typically focused on four to six measures. We evaluate all of our restaurants and our company performance on the same measures year after year. And now people understand that if we do those things well, they deliver sustained performance. And so they’ve become real guideposts. We just set new bold goals for our investors, and we announced that at our last investor call earlier this year. We said, “It’s time to stretch again and go farther faster.” We have a saying that one of our operations team members created that says you move what you measure. And we haven’t found a way to improve ourselves without a measure. It’s a marker. It’s feedback. It tells you whether you’re going forward or going backwards. And so we are incredibly focused on measuring the things we think are important to move. With a lot of political momentum behind the push for minimum wage hikes, which is happening in Seattle right now, for example, how will Popeyes cope with these mandated costs? How much can be automated? Well, you’re right that the cost of wages is probably the single pressing issue on a restaurant operator today. And people forget that restaurant operators typically own four or five restaurants and live in a small town. These are not big corporations. People also think that restaurants make a ton of money. They don’t. The average restaurant in our business has sales between a million two and a million four. And they make less than 10 percent after tax profit. So then $120,000 to $140,000 a year. Or $10,000 a month. That is not a lot of money. The total wages we pay in an average restaurant are $350,000, more than double the profit for the restaurant. So what people forget is that economics is an ecosystem. I believe we should pay fair wages. I also believe we should charge fair prices to our guests. And I also believe a small business person has a right to fair profits. Now interestingly, in a policy talk, if we decided to double our prices overnight, there’d be a bit of a problem in the media. Or if our franchise owner said, “I think it’s my right to make twice as much money,” there’d be a little bit of a problem in the media. But we think it’s just fine to double wages overnight? The ecosystem won’t work. There isn’t enough money to make that work. The only levers in a profit and loss statement are to raise your prices or cut your cost. It’s very simple math. And so what we will see, if wages move too rapidly, we move from $7.25 to $15, which has already happened in several cities, prices will go up very fast for guests, hours will come down for the employees, because we will find a way to do it with less. We have to. We will have to seek automation. There will be no option. We’ll just eliminate the need to have people talk to you. And then, finally otherwise, if it only comes out of the profits, there will be no restaurants. And if you read the follow-up on Seattle, for example, the restaurants have left the city limits of Seattle because they can’t make a fair profit. Does Popeyes operate in Seattle? We do. In the suburbs. Our franchisee operates near Seattle. And not only does he have wage challenges, but he also has beverage taxes, sick day policies. The amount of regulation in the West Coast states is almost defeating to an entrepreneur. In fact, some restaurant companies have decided to retreat from West Coast states. These things are really making it difficult for entrepreneurs to make a living, a fair living, for their families, to put their kids through college. And what people forget in the restaurant business, in Popeyes, 41 percent of our owners are immigrants to this country who came here to pursue the American Dream. They are some of the most hardworking, cool people you’ve ever met. And all they want to do is get a nice little apartment for their family and put their kids through college, things that all of us take for granted. I often say that entrepreneurs are not being defended in today’s policy conversations because they’re too busy working. And what we need is a millionperson march on Washington, the hardworking entrepreneurs who really are the backbone of our country, of economic growth and of this thing that we’ve always held dear—the American Dream. Focusing on this idea of the “American Dream,” you say in your book that “democratic capitalism creates conditions for entrepreneurs to invest and grow small businesses.” Do you think the hope for that American Dream has become more difficult today? Yes. I’ll give you one specific example of how it’s more difficult. Today, because the economics are not as strong in the business, it is harder to borrow money to start a business. And therefore, the banks are only lending money to larger businesses. And so you’re seeing in the restaurant industry, the mom-and-pop businesses are declining. The small chain operators are becoming big and the opportunity for that one-restaurant person has declined materially—and with that, the opportunity for that onerestaurant person to become a hundredrestaurant owner. We have people in Popeyes who started as a fry cook in an inner-city restaurant in Chicago and are multimillionaires today because they own 50, 60 restaurants. The opportunities are huge in this business. And you don’t have to have an MBA. And you don’t have to have a ton of money to get in. You have to have a work ethic and a passion for putting together a good team and taking care of your customers. Why would we want to discourage that? That’s why we work at this task. Try to influence it. You worked for Tom Monaghan for years at Domino’s Pizza. You credit him for instilling in you a zeal for operational excellence and an emphasis on character. Could you describe some of the character lessons you learned there? Well, the first thing I learned from him was how you run a restaurant company, which was huge. I’d never worked for a restaurant company before. And Tom had literally started the first Domino’s with $200 and a Volkswagen in Ann Arbor, Michigan. When I was there they had 5,000 or 6,000 restaurants. So he was a phenomenal restaurant operator and created a model that’s gone to take on the world, with over 9,000 stores today. The reason I went to work for Tom is that I really wanted to work for a man whose character was an important part of his convictions about how he led. And I met Tom in his life, after he’d sold off a lot of businesses and rabbit trails that he’d gone on in his life, and he was very focused on Domino’s, and he was very focused on charitable work. I got to watch up close how his character and his values impacted the company. And I got to watch up close how he, the man, was living his life at the age of 60 or so at the time. I then got to watch him sell the company and make a big announcement. The headline of the Detroit paper was, “I’m Going to Die Broke,” because he had a plan to give it all away between that day and the end of his life. And he’s doing that today. He talked a lot about the Golden Rule. And I don’t think I even realized how deeply imbedded that’s become in my leadership thinking. But it actually is one of the central ideas that you hear me talk about when I write about the turnaround of this company, because a huge part of leadership is being the leader you wished you worked for. I find lots of people tell me that they want to be a great leader. And I ask them, “Describe a great leader that you’ve worked for.” And they quickly tell me all the traits of that leader. And I say, “Are you being that leader to the people that work for you?” And there’s always a long pause. As in small things, we struggle to hold ourselves accountable to the Golden Rule in leadership as well. We struggle to be the leaders that we would want to work for ourselves. And it’s become a very provocative theme that I discuss with my leaders all the time. You know, they’ll come in upset about the performance of an individual. And I’ll say to them, “Well, how would you want to be treated in this circumstance? What conversation would you want your boss to have with you right now? Where would you like them to start?” Because it flips the frame around. And it makes the leader far more accountable for their actions than just to lash out at the person they’re upset with because of their performance. And I always say, “Look first at yourself and then to the other person. Look first at your behaviors, your actions, before you criticize the next,” but, boy, that’s hard to do. None of us are good at it. Your book, Dare to Serve, offers a path for corporate leadership that we don’t get often enough. What we usually get is the Hollywood stereotype of the greedy, selfish Wolf of Wall Street character who tramples down everyone in his way. Which of these two paths do you see more of in corporate leadership? The leadership approach of our culture is what Robert Greenleaf called “Leader First.” And too often that means that the power of the position assumed by the leader is used to accomplish the leader’s ambitions. And if it, by chance, serves the people in the enterprise, well, great. But the primary motive of a leader-first leader is his or herself. It’s the leadership model we teach, reward and celebrate in our culture. It’s on our magazine covers. It’s in our business schools. It’s in our universities. It’s in our homes. Greenleaf said at the other end of the spectrum is a leader who serves first. And he said this over 40 years ago. And he was not an academic or a consultant. He was kind of a Dilbert. He was in middle management at a large corporation called AT&T, just observing human behavior. He said there’s this other idea where you could be serving first. You would understand you have power (because leadership does come with power), but you would understand that you would use that power for the benefit of those that have been entrusted to your care. Very novel idea. And interestingly, he’s looked at as kind of an interesting essay writer from a long time ago. He’s the one who coined “servant leadership” as a phrase in the secular business world. But his ideas have not taken hold. Interestingly, other people have tried to make them more mainstream. The book Good to Great by Jim Collins is a seminal business book. It’s all about servant leadership. He calls it level 5 leadership. But it basically proves that humble, courageous leaders deliver the best financial performance. He decided not to call them servant leaders because it wasn’t a popular term. So he called them level 5 leaders. Then another guy recently, Adam Grant, the youngest tenured professor at Wharton, wrote Give and Take. It’s another book just like the first which says these people who think of others first or give more than they take actually outperform the rest. So it’s been documented. There’s another one called Firms of Endearment. So there are three major research-based, documented reports that companies that led in this fashion outperform the S&P 500 and their peers competitively. So why not more? It’s really countercultural. It’s so hard for people to even comprehend— after they’ve been raised up through team sports to be winners, through college to be ambitious, through jobs—how we promote ourselves and become the top dog in a company. All of that is aimed at self-development, with little regard for anybody else. This is deep-rooted in our culture. And the reason I wanted to write about it is I wanted to be a provocative voice of how you might actually do this, because I’m not an academic or a consultant either—I’m a doer. And there hadn’t been a doer book written since Bill Pollard wrote about ServiceMaster more than 30 years ago. And Max De Pree wrote about Herman Miller, the furniture company in Michigan. Those are the last two people that wrote about doing it. So my hope is that we can rejuvenate the conversation. But in our culture it’s going to have to be about performance, because that’s all we care about. If we did not have results, no one would be listening to this story or reading this book. It has to yield results to capture the attention of our culture. And that’s what we’ve set out to kind of prove here, “Hey, take a look at this. It’s counterculture.” You’re very open about your faith. Is that ever a problem as the leader of a major public company? Is there a certain mode in which the faith expresses itself—words or deeds? I believe strong leaders have strong convictions and beliefs. I think you could prove that if you look at leaders who have impacted history or change or business. They had a point of view. My point of view is faith-based. My convictions are biblical principles. And yet I work in a publicly traded stock environment. I believe I can live out all those principles without citing chapter and verse. And that makes the principles real, approachable and interesting to other people who may never have heard of the principles before or where they come from. So I love living them out. You mentioned words or deeds, and, you know, that thing your mom used to say, “Actions always speak louder than words.” I spend my energy checking to see if I’m living my convictions, and I try to rein in my instincts to talk about my convictions. Talk is cheap. Action is where the hard part comes and where the tests come of your convictions, the place where people see if you’re true to those convictions, right? So I’ve tried to put my energy into how I withstand the pressures of this job, how I treat people in good times and in bad, how I share my convictions in a concerned, loving way for other people, not a preachy, I got-it-all-together way. I am very open about my faith. I speak in many faith environments. And I decided, at some point, that that was who I am and that was who I was comfortable being. And if it’s a problem for people, they haven’t told me very often. So I don’t know. It’s worked so far. Are there any Biblical or religious themes that you apply to your corporate leadership? The Bible verse that’s on my calendar every day is Philippians 2:3. Because I haven’t found one that’s more paramount to how I want to lead in my family and in my work. And that is, “Do nothing from selfish ambition or conceit, but in humility count others more significant than yourselves.” That’s an ESV version, because I really like the choice of words around counting others more significant than yourselves. I believe we’re all born with an inner 2-year-old. And we’d really still like to be laying on the floor, kicking and screaming because we didn’t get the candy bar we wanted. It’s pretty hardwired that we’re self-absorbed little people. And we learn to fake it well, but we’re still pretty much that 2-year-old on the inside. I find that biblical perspective really challenging in every aspect of my day—how I’m spending my time, the decisions that I make. To put them through a filter of whether I’m thinking about myself or whether I’m thinking about others. I mean, it gets you into some really interesting conversations. “Am I doing this because I’ll get a bigger bonus check? Or am I really thinking about the long term interest of this company? Am I doing this truly for my franchise owners, or am I getting some personal benefit that I haven’t been willing to acknowledge?” Those kinds of provocative self-mirror questions hold you to a higher standard. I always say servant leadership is an aspiration, because you can really never claim you’ve arrived. Because as soon as you do, someone will find you—and in a trap of self-interest. It’s something you’re always working toward. Because we all are. We’re all in that trap. So the only question is, are you going to aspire to it, or are you going to use that as filter for your actions and decisions? And try to hold yourself more and more accountable to that over time. With your success, how do you measure achievement in a personal sense? One of my favorite lines from Robert Greenleaf is, “The only test of leadership is that somebody follows.” That’s a simplified version of the question. But I love that text. And I think what I’ve come to understand about my purpose and my calling is that I’m supposed to use my leadership to have an impact on the lives of others and specifically to develop better leaders for our communities, our families and our country. And so I have a personal purpose statement. Mine is to inspire purpose-driven leaders to exhibit confidence and character in all aspects of their lives. And that again holds me to, what am I doing today? As a woman in a prominent leadership role, can you talk about your experience as a businesswoman both now as an influencer, but also when you had positions that were lower on the totem pole? I often get asked, “When did you first know you were a leader?” And I think because I’m an oldest child, I thought I was a leader at a very young age. My first remembrance is when I was directing the family musical play at a reunion at nine years old and telling my sister she was the tree and my brother what song part he was supposed to sing. My siblings would tell you I’ve been giving direction for a very long time. That’s not necessarily leadership. So I think I grew up with a personality for leadership, a desire that helped organize and make things happen. And I experienced my father, who was an incredible business leader. I learned so much about both competence and character from my father, the single most important person in shaping who I am. So I didn’t enter work to be a working woman. I didn’t enter work to change the world or make an impact at all. None of that was really operative. I was trying to figure out how to take the things that I felt gifted to do—I loved marketing in college, and I loved leadership— and figure out, you know, how could I jump in this pond and do some of the things my father was able to do? And he always made it clear that he was impacting lives in business. He never saw it as just a paycheck. He ran 16 factories in Asia and knew people of every culture in the world. He had a deep-rooted love for developing leaders in those countries, in those factories, and he did. So I lived in this bubble where leadership was a cool thing to aspire to. My dad told us, “Do well in school. Work really hard. Give it your best, and things will turn out OK.” He was a deeply faith-based man—always talking to us about character decisions and what’s true and what’s not true in culture— and so that’s had a tremendous impact. The woman question is one I really didn’t think a lot about. Now, I was always among men. It was apparent that I was one of very few women, in particular when you get to the VP level, there are very few women to look to for role models. I can tell you that I was largely confused by the lack of women role models, because if there are no women role models, you have to look mostly at men for your cues. And I believe men and women are different. And so I think it was hard to find my leadership approach without role models. I think it would have been easier if I’d had people to check in with and say, “I do this a little differently. Do you think that’d be ok?” Rather than trying to constantly live by the standards of men that have been doing it this way for years. Trying to fit in. So I always tell particularly young leaders that the most important learning for me as a woman was learning to lead out of my authentic self, my wiring, my gifts, my calling. I needed to stop thinking about what the rest of the world thought about it. Did they think I should work? Did they think I shouldn’t work? Did they think I should do it this way or that way? That really was tripping me up and making me less effective than when I kind of figured out who I was and how I would contribute to the conversation. I’ve been a better leader since. So the sooner you can get to that version of your authentic self, the better. It takes experience. It doesn’t happen overnight. I’m watching that now in my daughters. But that’s where you want to get to. And from a faith perspective, live your life for an audience of One, not all these other people that have opinions about how you should live your life. So I really think that’s where I encourage young leaders to sort out, who do you live your life for? What are your convictions and beliefs? And are you living them authentically in your leadership? up Email Page Journal of Markets & Morality Purchase a subscription to the Journal of Markets & Morality to get access to the most recent issues.

Segundo matéria do jornal "Wall Street Journal", a P&G investiu muito em anúncios na rede social, justamente, por reconhecer que Facebook passou anos desenvolvendo a sua capacidade de concentrar consumidores com base em dados demográficos, hábitos de compra e marcos da vida. Marc Pritchard, diretor de marketing da P&G, disse que a empresa percebeu que levou a estratégia longe demais. "Agora vamos investir em publicidade que nos renda o máximo alcance e tenha maior precisão", disse o executivo ao "Wall Street Journal". Pritchard disse que a P&G não vai cortar gastos com o Facebook, mas terá uma estratégia mais direcionada, como anúncios de fraldas para gestantes. Ele disse que a empresa aumentou os investimentos em sites e plataformas digitais tradicionais e está reduzindo a publicidade em sites menores. Facebook começou a trabalhar com anúncio segmentado em 2007, quando tinha menos de 60 milhões de usuários ativos. No momento, a sua principal plataforma de marketing são as páginas dos usuários em que as empresas promovem gratuitamente seus produtos. No ano passado, o Facebook arrecadou US$ 17,08 bilhões em receita publicitária, aumento de 49% em relação a 2014 e detinha uma base de 1,7 bilhão de usuários ativos mensais. A P&G gasta aproximadamente US$ 7,2 bilhões em publicidade por ano em todo o mundo e já informou que planeja aumentar essas despesas neste ano. O esforço da companhia para melhorar o alcance dos anúncios é evidente. Perto do final do ano passado a empresa começou a apostar mais em anúncios em televisão, de acordo o WSJ. Durante o primeiro trimestre de 2016, os gastos com publicidade da empresa saltaram 11%, para US$ 429 milhões, informou a consultoria Kantar Media.

Ben Sun, an early Jet investor, writes about his optimism for the e-commerce site's sale to Walmart by Ben Sun Aug 11, 2016, 8:00am EDT tweet share Linkedin Marc Lore, CEO of e-commerce site Jet.com, which was recently acquired by Walmart. We were thrilled to wake up to Monday’s headlines announcing Walmart’s $3.3 billion purchase of Jet.com — the largest U.S. e-commerce transaction to date, but a small price to pay, given Walmart’s $230 billion market cap and drive to secure a toehold against its main rival, Amazon. Jet.com is an attractive buy for Walmart — the company has made a huge dent in the online retail market in just one year’s time, and it’s a great differentiator for Walmart. It’s no surprise that Jet.com is an attractive buy for Walmart; led by Marc Lore, co-founder of Quidsi (parent of Diapers.com), the company has made a huge dent in the online retail market in just one year’s time, and it’s a great differentiator for Walmart, which has been playing catch-up to Amazon’s e-commerce domination for years. As the only New York-based seed fund in Jet’s first round (we invested alongside New Enterprise Associates, Accel, Bain Capital Ventures and MentorTech), Primary Venture Partners has long believed in the company’s strategic vision. With Lore at the helm — he’s a repeat entrepreneur looking to make huge waves in a pool he knows so well — this investment decision was one that we immediately jumped at when we were given the chance two short years ago. The balance that’s hard to beat First, a bit about the titan that Jet has been challenging. Amazon has built a successful $240 billion business by leveraging its scale to find the right balance of price, selection and convenience. Finding that right balance enables consumers to buy anything they want, whenever they want, with just the few clicks of a button, and at prices that rival any brick-and-mortar store. It has shaped the way we think, the way we shop and the way we demand, and it’s largely responsible for our dwindling patience when it comes to waiting in lines. Amazon has come closest to finding that balance with Amazon Prime, which gives users free one- or two-day shipping on most items for just $99 per year (or $10.99 per month, for the commitment-phobic). The offering makes up the majority of Amazon’s gross merchandise volume, and Prime subscribers are increasing by leaps and bounds (the Prime customer base grew from 19 million to 63 million in the last year). Moreover, subscribers making twice as many purchases and spending more than double, on average, than non-Prime customers. With market share of 42 percent of the ecommerce market, and more than 7 percent of total retail sales occurring online, there’s no one who can beat Amazon at its own game in the foreseeable future. There’s one inherent weakness to the Prime offering and its encouragement of the single-unit purchase mentality — it is extremely expensive and logistically complex for the supplier Prime is a great deal for consumers, to be sure, enabling them to make impulse purchases with nary a thought to back-end shipping costs and logistics. But there’s one inherent weakness to the Prime offering and its encouragement of the single-unit purchase mentality. With Prime, Amazon has made itself an indispensable way of life for consumers who want to log on and quickly purchase any item they need, whenever they need it — be it a few sticks of deodorant or a flat-panel TV — without any consideration for shipping costs. This way of shopping, while attractive from the consumer side, is extremely expensive and logistically complex for the supplier. Amazon has attempted to streamline fulfillment through programs like Vendor Flex, which it launched in 2013 in an attempt to ship goods faster and cheaper by co-locating an Amazon fulfillment center within a manufacturer’s warehouse. The arrangement has eliminated many overhead and shipping costs, enabling Amazon to sell diapers and other items cheaper than its competitors. Amazon building a warehouse next to where P&G stores its Pampers allows the company to sell a pack of Pampers at the lowest price. However, if a customer wants to add to that purchase a small bottle of California Baby Lotion (which is not owned by P&G), that item will be shipped from a different warehouse, which means that the additional costs of shipping ultimately fall to the customer. However, if a supplier could combine the two items into one box, it could pass those shipping savings onto the customer and offer a better price. It was this notion that Marc Lore and the Jet team went after, knowing that they couldn’t compete with Amazon for single-unit orders. Fighting back with a price-first approach In his time at Quidsi, Lore had a front-row seat as Amazon snowballed and gained more and more traction. He realized that he could never beat Amazon at its own game, but he observed the structural weakness of the single-unit purchase consumer mentality, and found his angle of attack. He launched Jet as the anti-single-unit marketplace, and its value proposition lies in incentivizing consumers to purchase multiple items at once by discounting prices. So while Amazon tinkers with finding the perfect balance between price, selection and convenience, Jet prioritizes price, in hopes of being the go-to e-commerce platform for those that value price (which are a lot of people).. Marc Lore launched Jet as the anti-single-unit marketplace, and its value proposition lies in incentivizing consumers to purchase multiple items at once by discounting prices. From his years in ecommerce, Lore understands better than most that designing a site experience and back-end fulfillment infrastructure to support multiple-unit orders is very different than the processes involved in single-unit orders. He built Jet from the ground up with the specific customer experience, marketing, technology, supply chain, fulfillment logistics and infrastructure processes to encourage and support multi-unit purchases. Lore realized that if he got this right, it’s a model that Amazon wouldn’t be able to easily (if ever) replicate with its existing infrastructure that’s so squarely focused on single-unit purchases. We’ve seen this same price versus multi-unit purchase battle between Costco and Walmart. Seemingly after a similar customer, the discount retailers are vying for market share with two vastly different business models: Walmart via sheer scale and enormous selection of goods (it carries 120,000 SKUs and boasts a $230 market cap), and Costco via a warehouse model that makes most of its revenue on annual membership fees. Costco’s membership fee offers a big advantage for customers, as it enables Costco to sell its wares at the lowest prices without having to sweat its negligible profit margins. Those low prices, in turn, encourage customers to purchase more items at once — an approach that has resulted in an average Costco order of almost $400. So despite having fewer retail stores than Walmart and only 4,000 SKUs, Costco has been able to claim a meaningful position in the market, with a $75 billion market cap to boot. The moral of the story? With a differentiated merchandising strategy and the right infrastructure in place, a meaningful portion of the consumer population can be trained to value price over selection and convenience. Jet’s strategy offers Walmart a critical toehold Jet is chipping away at Amazon’s e-commerce dominance in the same way, and its success just 12 months out of the gate has proven that the battle for the e-commerce kingdom is far from over. The company has already hit a $1 billion run-rate gross merchandise value. It’s no wonder, then, that Jet is such an attractive buy for Walmart, which has been modeling its e-commerce strategy on Amazon’s for years. That mimicry hasn’t gotten the company very far, however, with Amazon far outpacing it in every facet of the digital game. Walmart now realizes that its path to success lies in fighting back in a nontraditional way, and has chosen Jet as its key differentiator. Jet gives Walmart a smart, alternative model for competing with Amazon. Rather than struggling to find that same balance of price, convenience and selection that Amazon has nearly perfected with Prime, Jet strives to gain loyal customers by valuing price above all. Lore and his founding team of repeat entrepreneurs are playing their own game by their own rules, and in Jet they’ve built an operation that’s already claimed a meaningful share of the ecommerce market. Backed by Walmart’s supplier clout, customer reach, and balance sheet strength, we expect Team Jet to be upping their game radically in the months and years to come.

(Getty) Ryan Lochte and Michael Phelps will face off Thursday night in what could be their final showdown. With both competing in the 200-meter individual medley final, Phelps and Lochte will compete against each other one last time in the Olympics. The Rio Olympics mark the fourth games the two have competed as teammates, and rivals. Both have experienced enormous success in their swimming careers and as a result, earned millions of dollars through endorsement deals. Here’s what you need to know about Lochte’s net worth, sponsorship deals, and medal wins. 1. He Has a Net Worth Estimated at $6.2 Million Lochte ranks second all time among Olympic swimmers with 12 overall medals, including six golds. (Getty) While Olympic athletes aren’t paid for their participation in the games, top finishes in the global spotlight can lead to increased marketability and business opportunities. Although an exact figure is not known, Lochte’s net worth is estimated to be around $6.2 million, according to Money Nation. The bulk of his wealth is from lucrative endorsement deals. 2. He Has Signed Major Endorsement Deals With Companies Including Speedo & Gatorade I am #TeamSpeedo, are you? https://t.co/6FZbEcrwzT pic.twitter.com/sPlhxYTXIH — Ryan Lochte (@RyanLochte) July 27, 2016 Lochte has been able to capitalize on strong performances in Beijing, and London by signing major endorsement deals. Prior to the 2012 Olympics, Fortune Magazine estimated that Lochte earned $2.3 million from endorsement deals with brands including Speedo, Gatorade and Ralph Lauren. Throughout his swimming career, Lochte has signed major endorsement deals with companies including Gillette, Mutual of Omaha, Nissan, AT&T, and Procter and Gamble. His most lucrative deal has been with Speedo. The deal began in 2006 and has earned him an estimated half million per year since then, according to Money Nation. The website states that Gatorade and Gillette have paid Lochte figures close to $3 million each. Money Nation reports that his contracts with Nissan, AT&T and Ralph Lauren are within the range of $1.5 million to $1.8 million each. In 2013, the 32-year-old even had his own reality TV show What Would Ryan Lochte Do? on E! but it was canceled after one season. 3. He Has Earned $225,000 From Olympic Medals 4 Olympics straight we've won this relay. So humbled to be apart of this moment! #USA #oly… https://t.co/conSe3uks1 pic.twitter.com/RcNXfD0bLx — Ryan Lochte (@RyanLochte) August 10, 2016 American athletes winning medals at the Rio Olympic Games receive a cash prize from the U.S. Olympic Committee. The awards vary based on the medal won. Those awards are on top of the actual value of a “gold” medal – which is around $366 for the Rio games. The gold medal is a mixture of a small amount of 24-karat gold, some copper and a lot of sterling silver, according to Time. With six gold and three each of silver and bronze, that’s $225,000 in cash payouts. That total is based on $25,000 for each of the six Olympic gold medals Lochte has won, plus $15,000 for each of his three silvers and $10,000 for each of his three bronzes. 4. He Has Made an Estimated $1.1 Million From Swimming Competitions Since 2004 Ryan Lochte swims the breaststroke leg of a preliminary heat of the men’s 200m IM during the 2016 Arena Pro Swim Series. (Getty) Cash awards aren’t only at the Olympics– other world swimming competitions also offer athletes the opportunity to rake in some dough. For a swimmer like Lochte, who has competed in dozens of global swimming competitions, that can add up to thousands of dollars. Since 2005, Lochte has competed in World Championships every two years since 2005, where he has earned 18 gold medals, five silver and four bronze. While there are not exact figures on the cash awards for medals in those non-Olympic contests, Money Nation applied the Olympic payouts for an estimate. Those payouts in addition to his Olympic earnings add up to an estimated $1.1 million, according to the website. 5. His Parents Lost Their Home in Foreclosure Ryan Lochte and his mother attend the 2011 Golden Goggles at JW Marriott Los Angeles. (Getty) Lochte’s parents lost their home in Port Orange, Florida to foreclosure in 2013. Steven and Ileana Lochte stopped making mortgage payments several months after Steven was arrested for a DUI, according to the Daily Mail. Radar Online reported that the Lochtes were first sued in 2012 by CitiMortgage, who claimed the couple took out a loan for $258,000 in 2007, which was due at a rate of $1,609.58 per month. According to court documents obtained by RadarOnline, the couple stopped making mortgage payments in 2011 and owed more than $242,000. The Lochtes, who have five children, divorced in February 2011, after nearly 36 years of marriage.

Fraz says: August 19, 2016 at 6:59 pm So sad. Lochte is an immature, entitled child who thinks and acts like a 16 year old. No doubt his parents and coaches indulged him throughout his life which caused him to believe he was entitled to do whatever he wanted, whenever and wherever he wished.

Banks Thursday, August 11, 2016 Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email Print SMS More Reddit Google Stumbleupon For media inquries, contact: Media Inquiries 202.797.6103 The past few years have brought good news for wind and solar electricity generation, especially in terms of declining costs and deployment of more and more capacity, but skepticism remains about renewable energy, perhaps driven by insufficient awareness of what’s actually happening in electricity markets. Author John P. Banks Nonresident Senior Fellow - Foreign Policy, Energy Security and Climate Initiative There is no question that deploying higher percentages of wind and solar generation poses challenges for the electricity system. But addressing these challenges is feasible: solutions are being implemented to accommodate clean renewable electricity at a reasonable cost and without threatening the stability of the grid. Many groups have been documenting this experience, such as the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, the International Energy Agency, the Regulatory Assistance Project, America’s Power Plan, and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory among others. But perhaps more importantly, customers–from households to large corporations–are demanding cleaner sources of energy, and system operators and many electric utilities are meeting this demand. Giving customers what they want: Corporate America and the electricity industry embrace renewables System operators are integrating higher percentages of renewable electricity generation, with several organized markets across the United States experiencing record levels of wind energy production. In February of this year, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) achieved 45 percent wind penetration on its grid, and the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) reached a record 13,084 megawatts (MW) from wind. In one recent survey of utility executives, nearly 70 percent identified utility scale renewables as the technology in which they are most invested, and in 2014, renewable energy accounted for at least 20 percent of total retail electricity sales for four major utilities: Xcel Energy, Pacific Gas & Electric, Sempra Energy, and Edison International. The Edison Electric Institute (EEI), representing the nation’s investor-owned utilities, emphasizes clean energy as one of the industry’s three strategic initiatives (the others being grid modernization and customer engagement).

In April 2014, Citigroup declared that the “age of renewables is beginning,” and Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and others have all announced multi-year, multi-billion dollar investments in clean energy technology. One of the more interesting trends emerging in the past several years is large corporations demanding renewable energy to power their businesses. In 2015, corporate customers such as Google, General Motors, Philips, Dow, Apple, Facebook, Owens Corning, Kaiser Permanente, and Procter & Gamble purchased 3.2 gigawatts (GW) of renewable energy. “Utility scale solar can really address the needs of the Clean Power Plan and other objectives we have.” – Nick Akins, CEO, AEP A recent report stated that nearly half of Fortune 500 companies, and 60 percent of Fortune 100 companies have “aggressive” clean energy goals. Recently, EEI joined World Resources Institute and the World Wildlife Fund to create a partnership– the Utility-Corporate Buyer Collaborative Forum–to further facilitate how utilities can meet corporate demand for renewable energy. Utilities such as Duke, Dominion, NV Energy, PSEG and others are beginning to respond specifically to this demand, developing shared solar, green tariff, and utility services and procurement products. “If you want to play in the future, you’ve got to be part of the solar industry.” – Ken Zagzebski, President, AES Implementing solutions to support high levels of renewable electricity Skepticism of renewables revolves around a view that wind and solar are too expensive and too variable, pose technical integration problems, threaten the reliability of the grid, and that addressing these concerns is costly. As noted, this perspective is based in part on how wind and solar are different than convention fuels–especially in how they interact with the grid–but it is also plainly true that solutions do exist to accommodate these resources on the grid and in electricity markets because it is clearly happening today. Capital costs and policy support There is a general perception that renewables are too expensive–driven by high up-front capital costs–and require subsidies and other policy support that raise prices for consumers. While some renewable technologies remain expensive, such as offshore wind or concentrated solar thermal, the costs of onshore wind and solar PV technology have declined dramatically in recent years, making these renewable technologies increasingly competitive. Lazard’s most recent assessment of the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) for various generation technologies indicates that onshore wind and utility scale solar PV–unsubsidized–are cost competitive with natural gas combined cycle and coal-fired power plants and cheaper to build than nuclear generation. Recent data from Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF) also indicates that in some regions in the United States, wind PPA prices are below on-peak wholesale prices: In 2015, average wind PPA prices were $19-35/MWh in Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, and Nebraska (although higher in New England). Wind PPAs in Texas–unsubsidized–are at an LCOE of around $50/MWh. In a nutshell, these prices are very competitive. At its annual summit in April, Bloomberg New Energy Finance estimated that globally wind costs have fallen 50 percent since 2009, and solar PV module costs have fallen 80 percent since 2008. Have policy supports for renewables increased prices for consumers? The most recent assessment by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) of renewable portfolio standards (RPS) implemented by 29 states and the District of Columbia reveals that RPS compliance costs were only 1.3 percent of average household bills in 2014. Some also assert that direct policy support for renewables, especially subsidies such as the federal production tax credit (PTC) for wind of 2.3 cents per kWh, represents a market-distortion. This type of criticism overlooks the fact that there are all sorts of non-market transactions, or interventions, in energy markets for specific technologies, not to mention market failures that policy tries to correct. Indeed, the PTC may be a subsidy, but you could argue that it represents about the added cost to account for carbon externalities if applied to the electricity produced by a coal-fired plant that the wind generator displaces. And right now, that coal plant is effectively getting a subsidy by allowing it to emit carbon into the atmosphere.

By Frances Seymour and Jonah Busch 2016 C Upcoming Challenges in the Process of China’s Urbanization Edited by Karen Eggleston, Jean C. Oi, and Yiming Wang 2016 A more relevant, constructive and certainly legitimate critique is to re-assess the most efficient policy approaches in light of de-carbonization goals, the level of a technology’s commercialization, and other factors. The current debate over whether and how to address the declining competitiveness of some nuclear power plants reflects this broader issue, and the New York Public Service Commission’s recent recommendation that several nuclear plants receive a credit based on the social cost of carbon indicates one specific approach as part of this discussion. Variability and intermittency It is often claimed that variable renewable energy (RE) resources are unreliable: The wind doesn’t always blow and sun doesn’t always shine (variability), and the weather is difficult to forecast with enough accuracy to ensure reliability of the system (intermittency). This is perhaps the most common critical refrain concerning renewable electricity generation. What is actually happening in markets illustrates that variability and intermittency are manageable and much less of a problem than imagined. System operators can’t control RE generators, but rather accommodate them through a suite of tools and approaches that provide system flexibility. In short, flexibility is the new paradigm for electricity systems, and this flexibility is being achieved in a variety of ways: Fast markets: The cheapest approaches involve adapting market rules to accommodate renewables. Simply stated, these tools, such as sub-hourly scheduling and dispatch, allow markets to adapt more rapidly and closer to real time to changing wind and solar conditions. For example, ERCOT and MISO have five minute, real-time energy markets. These “faster” markets are more efficient and reliable, and reduce reserves needed to balance the system. Expanded grid operating areas: Larger operating areas allow grid operators to access a wider array of resources, thus mitigating variability, ensuring reliability, and lowering costs. For example, the Western Energy Imbalance Market (EIM) was launched on November 1, 2014, with the goal to connect disparate balancing authorities across California, Oregon, Nevada, Washington, Utah, Idaho, and Wyoming. In fact, one of the reasons this occurred is because of the recognition that having a larger grid operating area is essential as the amount of renewable energy resources continues to grow. The California Independent System Operator (CAISO) just released its quarterly assessment of the EIM, quantifying benefits of $64.6 million since its inception. These benefits are related to more efficient dispatch, reduced renewable energy curtailment, and reduced flexibility reserves needed. Improved forecasting: Wind forecasting capabilities have greatly improved in recent years helping to address intermittency. Experience reveals that wind is far more predictable than previously thought within typical dispatch times, and that most of the major ISO markets in the United States are dispatching wind based on wind levels 10 minutes before real time “with an accuracy comparable to that of load and conventional generators.” Xcel Energy has been working with the National Center for Atmospheric Research since 2009 to develop state of the art weather forecasting models. Xcel estimates that by 2014 these models saved the utility’s customers $40 million largely in “fuel savings due to more efficient system dispatch.” Flexible demand: Another way to provide flexibility to accommodate RE is implementing approaches that allow demand to be managed. Demand response (DR) programs can participate in capacity and ancillary service markets, and help load balancing during large supply losses. For example, more than 10,000 MW of DR resources were procured in the most recent PJM capacity market auction for the 2019/2020 delivery year. Flexible generation: Increasing the amount of variable renewable electricity generation requires the existing conventional fleet of dispatchable generators to cycle more, i.e., ramp up and ramp down, to accommodate RE. While nuclear, coal, and some (non-peaking) natural gas units have not typically been designed to cycle in this manner, raising concerns over increasing wear and tear and added maintenance costs, there are approaches to increase the flexibility of conventional generators. NREL worked with a coal-fired facility in the U.S. demonstrating the ability to load follow, run at minimum generation levels, and start-up and shut-down in the same day, accomplished with a variety of operational changes. Xcel Energy in Colorado has implemented similar changes for its natural gas plants, and nuclear plants in some circumstances are also capable of flexible operation: Jim Conca recently wrote about Germany’s 1,400 MW Grohnde reactor that, although typically used as baseload, is now running 600 hours per month to regulate load. Finally, while using conventional generators as flexible resources does add cost, evidence to date suggests that these costs are far outweighed by the savings in fuel costs as coal and natural gas fired units run fewer hours. NREL estimated that with up to 33 percent penetration of wind and solar in the western U.S. grid, cycling costs would increase $35 to $157 million annually (or $0.47 to $1.28/MWh), but would save $7 billion in annual fuel costs. Storage: Storage provides flexibility through load shifting (using excess renewable production for later peak periods), balancing (reducing net load ramps), and participating in ancillary services markets (addressing frequency and regulation needs). Skeptics of the role that renewables can play, and the amount that can be deployed, often base their view on two assertions: that RE needs storage to work, and that storage is too costly and will remain so for the foreseeable future. First, storage is but one tool to provide flexibility, as shown above, and second, while cost is still a challenge for storage, there is strong evidence that costs are coming down, deployment is increasing, and there is more and more policy and regulatory support emerging to promote storage.The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) reports that non-hydro storage capacity in the United States doubled in the period 2010-2015, and BNEF’s New Energy Outlook 2016 projects battery costs to decline 60 percent by 2030. Greentech Media’s most recent storage market assessment reports that 20 states and four regional markets have storage policies. Programs and policies are also emerging at the federal level exemplified by a recently announced White House initiative to promote storage, and the Senate’s draft energy legislation (S. 2012) proposing $50 million annually from FY2017 to FY2026 for DOE to carry out storage R&D (although it remains to be seen if this legislation will move forward). In a recent survey of U.S. utility executives, 65 percent ranked energy storage as the technology in which they should invest more. Utilities are actively responding to these trends. In late 2014, Southern California Edison awarded contracts for 260 MW of storage as part of a procurement to replace the retirement of the San Onofre nuclear station and several large natural gas generation units, and Oncor, the largest transmission and distribution company in Texas, announced plans to invest over $5 billion in storage. Integration costs Many critiques of renewables not only highlight their high up-front capital costs, but also the cost of integrating them, which many warn are not factored into overall costs. The IEA neatly summarizes three categories of integration costs: network (transmission interconnection); balancing (increased need for ancillary services); and capacity adequacy (backup generation capacity). Experience thus far, however, indicates that RE integration costs are modest and manageable. NREL’s assessment of a number of studies concludes that integration costs are between $5 to $12/MWh (and frequently below $5/MWh) for wind capacity levels up to 40 percent of peak load. Moreover, it’s worth highlighting two facts about electricity system operation, as articulated by NREL: Greater penetration of RE does require more flexibility, i.e., more responsive conventional generation and responsive load, but does not increase overall capacity requirements; and second, all generators impose costs when added to a power system, but they are “seldom calculated as integration costs and never applied to conventional generators as integration costs.” Technical integration RE resources pose technical integration challenges: Since they are not synchronous generation–there is no direct electro-mechanical link to the grid–they are incapable of providing some typical ancillary services, such as stabilizing inertia (helping maintain frequency) and reactive power (helping maintain voltage levels). Nevertheless, approaches are being implemented to make ancillary service markets and the renewable energy generators themselves more flexible. ERCOT is working on developing a new ancillary service to better address frequency response (its Fast Frequency Response product), and CAISO is proposing a Flexible Ramping Product to secure up-ramping and down-ramping resources in both the day-ahead and real-time markets. Markets and utilities also are increasingly allowing or requiring RE to participate in ancillary service markets. While there are differences in implementation rules across system operators, PJM, MISO, ERCOT, NYISO, and ISO-NE allow wind to participate in ancillary service markets, providing such services as frequency response and voltage regulation. Capacity factor and baseload capacity Another critique of RE is that variability means they run fewer hours and produce less of their rated capacity compared to conventional, dispatchable resources, and are unable to provide baseload capacity. The reality is that capacity factors for renewables have been improving dramatically. BNEF estimates an average capacity factor for onshore wind in the United States of 37 percent for the second half of 2015, with capacity factors in Texas over 50 percent. LBNL research reports an average capacity factor of 27 percent for utility-scale solar (including both PV and CSP projects), with some individual installations reaching 35 percent. Meanwhile, the U.S. EIA estimates that the average capacity factors in 2015 for gas combined cycle plants and coal steam plants were both around 55 percent (for nuclear, capacity factor is around 90 percent). “The idea of baseload power is already outdated.” – Steve Holliday, CEO of National Grid Baseload is an economic concept in transition. For over a century the power sector has been structured around using controllable generation technologies to meet variable demand. However, the fundamental challenge going forward is to think about electricity systems differently: As more and more variable generation is deployed, the new paradigm for electricity markets is flexibility. As experts at America’s Power Plan aptly state: “In previous decades, grid operators looked at demand as an independent variable, and dispatched supply to meet it. Now, supply is more variable and demand is more controllable.” This reality is reflected more and more in the views of utilities. Steve Holliday, the CEO of National Grid summarized: “An extraordinary amount of capital was tied up for an unusual set of circumstances: to ensure supply at any moment. This is now turned on its head. The future will be much more driven by availability of supply: by demand side response and management which will enable the market to balance price of supply and of demand. It’s how we balance these things that will determine the future shape of our business.” Transmission Renewable energy resources are often located far from demand, requiring expensive and difficult to site transmission infrastructure. There is no question that building new transmission is difficult: It often takes up to 10 years in the United States and other locations, owing to regulatory review, permitting and siting requirements, property and eminent domain disputes, and not-in-my-backyard sentiment across multiple jurisdictions. Nevertheless, there are recent examples of successful approaches to addressing the transmission challenge, including innovative planning and cost allocation methodologies. The CEO of the Southwest Power Pool credited the Highway-Byway Cost Allocation process with allowing that market to deliver higher levels of wind generation. In 2008, the Texas Public Utilities Commission authorized the creation of five “competitive renewable energy zones” (CREZ), designating wind rich areas in the western part of the state and authorizing transmission expansion and new construction to bring the electricity to demand centers in the east. A recent report from the University of Minnesota documented how 11 utilities across Minnesota, Wisconsin, North Dakota, and South Dakota collaborated and worked with local stakeholders to “plan, develop, and build $2.1 billion worth of new high-voltage transmission lines spanning nearly 800 miles.” Competitive Renewable Energy Zones in Texas are credited with facilitating the addition of 3,500 miles of transmission lines and reducing curtailments of wind generation from 17 percent of total wind production in 2009 to 0.5 percent in 2014. While estimates of transmission-related costs to accommodate higher levels of renewable energy penetration vary, they are generally a small percentage of total costs. For example, NREL examined a variety of scenarios of wind penetration by 2024 in the Eastern Interconnect of the United States and found incremental transmission costs to be less than 10 percent of total system costs up to 30 percent wind penetration. Large-scale renewables are a growing part of the generation mix Adding a significant amount of renewable energy does indeed challenge the way electricity systems have been structured and operated for over a century. But cost-effective solutions exist, and high levels of renewable energy in the electricity mix are possible, presenting more of an economic challenge than technical one. NREL’s assessment of numerous grid integration studies concludes that deployment of RE of “at least 30 percent is achieved by implementing largely well-understood changes to system operations along with transmission capacity expansion,” and its Renewable Electricity Futures Study showed relatively small rate increases over next 40 years with 80 percent renewable energy in 2050. And it’s not just a variety of studies championing RE: electric companies and system operators are integrating more and more of these resources each year. In fact, electric utility companies are responsible for virtually all of the wind energy in the United States and about 60 percent of the solar energy deployed is owned by electric utilities. Thus, it is no longer a question of whether deploying and integrating large-scale renewables is possible. Rather, the key questions going forward are: working out the most effective and efficient policies to incentivize as many low carbon resources as possible, and; integrating distributed energy resources–specifically, “understanding the complete value chain for all parties…and getting the pricing right.” Renewables are not the only answer to the energy-climate challenge, but we need every low carbon MWh available, and skeptics should at least recognize what corporate America, Wall Street, system operators, a growing number of utilities, and more and more households already do–that innovations in policy, technology, and market operations are taking place in real-time allowing the integration of higher levels of clean renewable energy while maintaining reliability and affordability.

Snapchat When Snapchat unleashed its ad-tech program Snap Partners in June with plans to serve video ads between stories, observers wondered how users would respond to seeing ads alongside their friends' videos and photos. Two months in, Snapchat is already expanding its initial pilot to include more advertisers eager to reach the app's 150 million daily users. The ads appear between strings of photos and videos that users have share with their followers. Snapchat caps the amount of ads so that each person is served three so-called Snap Ads Between Friends promos per day—one in the morning, one in the afternoon and one at night. Over the past few weeks, the number of ads has steadily increased. Based on Adweek's own testing, each Snapchat user views the same number of daily ads, regardless of how much content they consume. In other words, someone who watches 100 stories per day is exposed to the same number of ads as someone who watches a handful of clips. Snapchat declined to comment about its ad load. Ten brands—including Verizon, Express and Procter & Gamble—piloted the ad format earlier this summer, and now the format is available to a wider group of marketers. Dunkin' Donuts, Unilever's skin care brand Simple, L'Oreal-owned Maybelline, Starbucks and JCPenney have all run ads between snaps in the past week. Similar to Snapchat's broader Snap Ads format that runs within Discover and Live Stories, the length of a skippable video ad in between snaps is limited to 10 seconds. They can also be targeted by age, gender, location, type of device, carrier and content affinity. But unlike Discover or Live Story ads, vertical videos between snaps don't include options to "swipe up" to watch a longer video clip or visit a website, which Snapchat has been pushing advertisers to experiment with in recent months. The move to limit the number of daily ads is part of what many see as Snapchat's steady but aggressive advertising push to reach $350 million in revenue this year and $1 billion by the end of 2017, according to leaked documents. To get there and compete for budgets alongside Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest and others, the rollout of ads on Snapchat has been gradual in order to avoid ruining the user experience. The ad formats mimic the app's popular features like lenses and filters that its millennial-heavy audience loves. In 36 days in June and July, Snapchat sold 14 sponsored lenses in the U.S. that can cost upwards of $600,000 for a one-day takeover on non-holiday days. "We have to be thoughtful about the inventory, ad load and the ad experience," Peter Sellis, Snapchat's head of monetization product, told Adweek in June when launching its API. "By doing this the right way, focused on creativity and doing it early, it allows us to be extraordinarily conservative. Something that I think often gets lost is that ad effectiveness can be inversely correlated with the number of ads that the viewer sees. If you see 50 ads in a day, the probability of you remembering them is low."

Apparently, its $11-billion operating budget is lower than the Athens Olympics budget ($15 billion) of 2004! It isn’t the most watched Olympics on TV either. Fewer viewers watched the opening ceremony than during London. And only 82 per cent of the tickets have been sold, even at half the price of London. But it has many firsts: It’s the first in a South American city. First in a Portuguese-speaking country. Motto: Um mundo novo (A new world). First to host a Refugee Olympic Team (country code: ROT). And yet. The Olympics have never been just about sports and a spectacle, they are a statement of power. In sheer numbers, the India-Pakistan 2015 World Cup match had the highest number of viewers of any sport. One billion! So it’s not about just viewership. They are a statement of power on a global stage. With 207 participants – for the individuals who participate and wish to make a statement (think Jesse Owens), for the country that hosts (fact: Between 1950 and 2005, Olympic host cities were in countries with an average real GDP per capita of $9,546) and the brands that use it as a marketing event. Samsung pulled away from its Korean roots and took its rightful place at the global brand table by sponsoring the Olympic Games in 1988. P&G went from being a concealed ‘House of Brands’ to a warm, loveable “Proud Sponsor of Moms” at the Olympics of 2012, adding over $500 million in product sales in the bargain. It will continue to build on this association till 2020. Its Rio campaign (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQ3k6BFX2uw) celebrates how mothers shape achievers. GE has pursued its agenda of turning green by pursuing sustainability with the IOC since 2005. And yet. Rio 2016 will mark several species of change for the marketing community, changes that will test their creativity all over again. Change One: Rule 40 The new IOC rule has had athletes and brands up in arms. Non-sponsors can’t use words such as “Olympics,” “Summer Games,” or even generic words such as “games,” “gold,” or “Rio”. And athletes can tweet about their sponsors, but without using those words. This means marketers must find new ways of bypassing the rule. See the breathtaking, almost poetic ad for Under Armour with Michael Phelps (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xh9jAD1ofm4). No mention of Olympics, but it’s very clearly about Olympics! Obviously, the IOC has created the rule to protect the interests of the five big sponsors who dole out $200 million each … but there is research to show that viewers also associate high-profile brands as sponsors of the Olympics. Change Two: Many screens Because of the time zone of South America, most viewing will be time-adjusted around the world (YouTube’s Olympic Channel will start August 21). Olympic Broadcasting Services, host broadcaster, has itself stated that for the first time in Olympic history, its digital-oriented footage will outnumber the amount of television-oriented footage. The marketer has to make sure his brand messaging has the ability to hold its own across many screens. And what holds attention on any screen size? Stories. Authentic stories. Marketers are using the authenticity of the stories of the athletes they sponsor to bypass the cynicism of the viewers. Phelps’ son has his own Instagram account (https://www.instagram.com/boomerrphelps/?hl=en) which translates like this in communication parlance: “I adore Boomer + I respect Phelps = I most likely will like brand (Under Armour) he is sponsored by.” Usain Bolt has an animation film from Gatorade, a feature film trailer out on Twitter and an Instagram logic of Usain = Champion = Champion Razors. Nike uses Serena Williams and our very own Dipa Karmakar is on WSJ Videos, explaining how she had a flat foot and was told she would never be good at gymnastics. Change Three: Live & 360 degree So, while on the one hand conditions will encourage deferred viewing, it will also be the most live broadcast Olympic ever: 85 hours in 360-degree virtual reality formats by the Olympic Broadcasting Services, plus Twitter with its Periscope and Vine. Here is Sania Mirza launching the Indian flag emoji on Twitter (https://twitter.com/mirzasania/status/760462829224878080)…there are 207 emojis, one for each nation! So how does the marketer sustain interest when everything is live? Where does the message sneak in? Google is doing it by bypassing the Olympics altogether. It is focusing instead on the venue, but enriching it with 360 degree views (https://www.google.com/cultural institute/beta/u/0/project/rio-de- janeiro). And one last thing, as Steve Jobs used to say. The Russian track and field and weightlifting teams were banned from the Rio 2016 Games for doping. Their absence makes a substantial difference. After all, in London 2012 the team took home a total of 82 medals. Cheating at the Olympics grows cleverer and cleverer. One opinion is that cheaters are five to ten years ahead of detectors. But rather than get into a competition between cheaters and catchers outside the arena, what if we conducted a thought-experiment where everything was allowed inside the arena? Who would win? What else would they use (Exo-skeletons? Bionic limbs? CRISPR-Cas9)? What tricks would marketers encourage their athletes to use? It’s an interesting question and I urge you to read all about it here: http://www.diamandis.com/ blog/unlimited-olympics-would-you- watch-it (This article was published on August 11, 2016) Related TOPICS sport | Get more of your favourite news delivered to your inbox SEND MY NEWS Please enter your email.

New Generation Latino Media, created by Leguizamo and David Chitel in 2013, works with Procter and Gamble, Ford Motor, and Amtrak, using digital video. The content firm “creates and distributes sponsored content across Latino-oriented sites using proprietary technology that serves videos in ads.” READ: John Leguizamo Says “We’ve Gotta Do Everything To Help Our Black Brothers And Sisters” NGL has already produced 20 videos for Orgullosa, in which Afro-Latinx actresses Gina Rodriguez and Dascha Polanco explain their journey into acting, with Rodriguez speaking to a group of young actresses of color, and Polanco shedding light on her Dominican upbringing in New York. The digital videos touch on a generation of Latinx kids who are growing up with new forms of media—seeing positive reflections of various aspects of themselves and various aspects of their identity is critical. Until recently, Latinx portrayals have had negative effects on the community, but digital media videos might be able to change the narrative.

By Shira Ovide. Added by Agency Staff on 11 August 2016. Saved under Top, World Tags: Facebook, Google, Mark Zuckerberg Tweet Mark Zuckerberg Facebook collects less than the 5% of the US$500bn spent on advertising each year. To achieve the deepest, darkest dreams of Mark Zuckerberg, the company must become the first one that dominates both the kind of precision ads that built Google and the emotional ads that made TV the world’s dominant marketing force. Facebook has so far cracked the first half of that equation, following in the footsteps of Google by locking down what’s called “direct response” advertising. If I own a store in Brooklyn that sells running shoes, I naturally want to find people who are in the market for what I’m selling. If someone types “running shoes Brooklyn” into Google, the company has a pretty good clue that is a person I want. My store can pay to show a link to my website to this probable Brooklyn runner. Largely because Google became an efficient way for many businesses to find people who are looking for exactly what the businesses are selling, direct response ads make up the majority of online advertising. Facebook is pretty good at this type of advertising, too, again because we tell Facebook who we are and what we like. But dominating direct response ads with Google isn’t enough for Facebook. About $200bn is spent each year on TV commercials, mostly on direct response’s handsome brother, branded advertising. Brand ads are those TV commercials of a smiling couple driving an Audi through a snowy mountain range. The next time we go car shopping, Audi wants us to have this innate feeling that its vehicles will make us happy and beautiful. Away from the Internet, brand ads make up a majority of advertising. And they’re lucrative. The average cost to reach a thousand people with a prime-time TV ad was $50 in 2015, according to a Bloomberg Intelligence analysis. The comparable ad price on Facebook was $5. Facebook wants these pricey brand ads desperately. Facebook’s Sheryl Sandberg is fond of saying that for advertisers and their $500bn budgets, the social network is like the Super Bowl every night. She’s wrong. Facebook is way bigger than the Super Bowl. More than 1,1bn people use Facebook daily. About 110m people watch the Super Bowl telecast. Sandberg’s pitch is about convincing advertisers to think of Facebook as a place that is even bigger than TV’s biggest stage but with the stockpile of personal information to target ads only to people who are most likely to buy an Audi. In Facebook’s view, it is the best of Google’s bloodlessly efficient direct response advertising with the mass reach and charm of TV commercials. It sounds beautiful, but it turns out it can be hard to be both Google and television. The world’s biggest advertiser, Procter & Gamble, told the Wall Street Journal that it found targeting niches like teenage shavers on Facebook generated too narrow an audience for P&G brands that need to sells millions of bottles of Tide and Gillette razors. This seems, I don’t know, blindingly obvious? P&G said it won’t spend less money on Facebook, but it and some other big advertisers seem to be falling back in love with TV. The top 100 marketers spent 1% more on TV ads in the first quarter of this year compared with the amount in the period a year earlier, according to a Morgan Stanley analysis published in May. That was a lift from a 2% decline in their combined TV ad spending last year. P&G was among a handful of top brand advertisers — also including GM, Pepsi and Verizon — that sharply increased their TV ad spending this year after pulling back in 2015. “Investors should feel better about TV’s place in ad budgets today than they did a year ago,” Morgan Stanley wrote. What’s good for TV is probably not good for Facebook’s ambitions in brand advertising. Still, the winds are at Facebook’s back. Younger people in particular are spending more free time on their phones, including on Facebook, and less on TV. Facebook is expanding the pool of potential advertisers to small businesses that never advertised beyond the Yellow Pages. Facebook’s commitment to online video — which looks a lot like TV — helps it lure brand ads, too. It won’t be easy for Facebook, but the company knows it won’t crack the next 95% of that advertising spending unless it figures out how to become the perfect advertising medium for companies hunting for the best blend of TV and the Web.  — (c) 2016 Bloomberg LP Share this article Tweet Connect with TechCentral Follow TechCentral on Twitter Connect with TechCentral on Facebook Connect with TechCentral on Google+ Subscribe to our newsletter Articles by comments (7 days) 9Why SA Connect tender was cancelled 9Vodacom to launch VOD platform 7A radical proposal for state-owned fibre 5MTN’s Mteto Nyati takes the fight to No 1 5One day I will tell you the truth – Zuma Home About Advertise Newsletter Contact RSS ↑ TechCentral TechCentral Log in - (c) 2009 - 2015 NewsCentral Media

As we munched on the Indo-Western fusion choice of Pav Bhaji Tortillas, we spoke about a wide range of things: how Amazon Prime will be a huge fillip to Amazon India, the media’s obsession with Indian e-commerce, how fintech is the next big thing for Indian start-ups and so on. As someone tracking investments, I popped the question, “What do you think about the Unilever Dollar Shave acquisition?” He said, “It can’t get more benign than this, right,” essentially alluding to the simplicity of Dollar Shave Club—a start-up that’s a little over four years old and offers a blades-by-subscription service for as little as $3 a month (including shipping and handling). “Perhaps that is what makes it so compelling too,” he was quick to add. There is some merit to that comment. After all, a buttoned-down Unilever, which gives you an impression of an uptight, global biggie, snapped up a scrappy Dollar Shave that feels more like it belongs in the tech sector than the consumer products industry. The announcement of the billion-dollar acquisition, in fact, raised hopes for a lot of venture capitalists back home, with some of them giving themselves a pat on the back as if their thesis of backing niche e-commerce start-ups had just received validation. Some of them also took to Twitter and LinkedIn to voice their enthusiasm. But what makes Dollar Shave so appealing is not a testament to the attraction of e-commerce so much as it is about building a formidable online brand, says a Bloomberg report. Going through media reports will tell you what Dollar Shave achieved in such a short span of time: it actually created a market for razor blades. A report in Harvard Business Review said the online market for razor blades has grown from virtually zero to $263 million, citing estimates from Slice Intelligence, a market research firm, owing to the momentum of Dollar Shave Club. The company turned out to be a disruptive rival and actually snatched market share from incumbents like Gillette, still the No. 1 razor brand, which saw its market share fall from 71% in 2010 to 59% in 2015. (And for the record, Gillette, owned by Procter and Gamble, sued Dollar Shave Club late last year for patent infringement. Dollar Shave Club filed a counter-suit in February.). Also, Dollar Shave turned the industry upside-down with its direct-to-consumer marketing tactics: the day it started selling subscriptions in March 2012, the company released a YouTube video starring founder Michael Dubin. He tells viewers the product is f***ing great, “so gentle a toddler could use it”. The website crashed, but the blades sold out in six hours. So, my question is, do we have a Dollar Shave Club in India? I asked quite a few venture capitalists. The answer ranged from “None” to “We will get there” to “Oh yes! We do.” Predictably, the third bunch pointed to a new phenomenon—vertical e-commerce start-ups emerging in India. The names thrown around included niche plays building in jewellery segments, apparel and so on. Really? Are these assets unique? Has any of them built a direct-to-consumer engine where a large traditional company can come tomorrow to bolt its other brands on and pay such a huge strategic premium? Have any of them actually created a new market to grow at a lightning speed and snatched market share from incumbents? Coming specifically to vertical e-commerce plays in India dubbed as “brands”, it is more like a mixed bag. We already know that many online apparel firms are in trouble. However, the good news is that some players are taking a full stack approach and realizing that the era of lead-generation is over. A few like Bluestone come to mind. Looking at the Unilever-Dollar Shave Club deal, involving the acquisition of a disruptive rival for a five-times revenue multiple, as snapping up just another e-commerce start-up is a puerile way of looking at things. The key here is that Dollar Shave built a unique, formidable, and disruptive digital brand, which pretty much upended the industry’s traditional business model. Also, if one reads the blog of early investor David Pakman , he never saw Dollar Shave Club as an e-commerce firm from the very beginning. Venture capitalists trying to build another Dollar Shave Club in India should start with such a thesis. There is a huge macro opportunity out there—any report from a large consulting firm will tell you that the consumer market in India is exploding. The fact is that this market is right now being driven a lot by pricing and a little by convenience. There is a huge potential to build a habit-forming product such as Dollar Shave and make it addictive. “If I open the drawer of my son, it is stacked up with razor blades of Dollar Shave. One, he is too lazy to (cancel the subscription service), and second, he just loves the offering,” said another US-based venture capital investor. Dollar Shave became addictive by learning about its audience; it curates messages specifically meant to keep them engaged. With each delivery, customers get a Bathroom Minutes magazine. So before you club it with all the other e-commerce companies, think twice. And just so you know, there is a report today which says that the desi version of Dollar Shave Club—Bombay Shave Club—has raised money from angel investors. It shouldn’t be a mere copy of Dollar Shave Club but a desi version that works in India. Just like Pav Bhaji Tortillas. Shrija Agrawal is Mint’s deals editor.

InvestorPlace 8/10/2016 Charles Sizemore © Jerome Favre/Bloomberg The Apple Inc. logo is displayed at one of the company's stores in Hong Kong. People come from all around the world to see Mount Everest. But if you lived in Nepal and saw it lurking in the distance every day, it might not seem nearly as impressive. You might take it for granted or even dismiss it as no big deal.  Quotes in the article Apple Inc AAPL ▼ 111.17 -0.63 -0.56% Twitter Inc TWTR ▼ 18.18 -0.45 -2.39% Kellogg Co K ▼ 73.30 -1.19 -1.60% That’s really where we are today with Apple (AAPL) and the absolutely gargantuan Apple cash hoard. The tally for Apple’s cash and marketable securities has been so large for so long that no one really pays attention to it anymore. In fact, it seems the most common thing I hear said about the Apple cash stockpile these days is that “it’s really not that big.” People cite the fact that much of the quoted cash pile is really longer-term securities and remind you about Apple’s debt and potential tax implications. Frankly, that’s ridiculous. Apple Has a Lot of “Cash” Even allowing for a massive tax haircut, AAPL’s cash hoard would rank as one of history largest treasures … a fortune that would make Croesus blush. As of Apple’s latest quarterly earnings report, the company had $231.5 billion in cash and marketable securities. The Apple cash balance — the gross number, before any debt or tax considerations — would represent the 13th-largest company in the world: bigger than Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT) and Procter & Gamble Co (PG), and just a few billion shy of JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM). 9 Stocks That Will Sprint Past Everything Else Of course, Apple’s cash is mostly overseas, while Apple’s $72.4 billion in debt is mostly domestic. But let’s pretend that AAPL suddenly got religion and decided it wanted to be debt-free now. And let’s further assume that Apple wanted to move its entire cash hoard stateside because … go America! And let’s take this one step further and assume that Apple is paying the full 35% U.S. corporate tax rate on the whole pile of money. (None of these are realistic assumptions, mind you, but let’s go through the exercise anyway.) After taxes, Apple’s $231.5 billion in cash and securities becomes $150.5 billion. That would still put the Apple cash hoard in the top 30 largest companies in the S&P 500 … about on par with Phillip Morris International (PM). After stripping out the $72.4 billion in debt, the $150.5 billion becomes $78.1 billion. That’s still not exactly chump change. In fact, that’s nearly double the average (mean) market cap of all S&P 500 companies and more than four times bigger than the median market cap of all S&P 500 companies! And remember, this all assumes the absolute worst-case scenario for taxes. Were Apple to actually attempt to repatriate its cash, it would likely negotiate much better terms. After all, if AAPL really thought it was going to get hit at 35% no matter what … wouldn’t it have gritted its teeth and brought the cash ashore by now? So, yes. The Apple cash hoard is a big deal, no matter how you slice it. Taking a Deeper Look at Apple’s War Chest A skeptic will point out that only $18.2 billion of the $231.5 billion is actual “cash” in the bank. The rest is held in “marketable securities.” That’s true, but let’s dig a little deeper there. The quarterly 10-Q report gives a fair amount of detail as to what makes up the Apple cash hoard: Cash and Marketable Securities Fair Market Value (millions) as of 6/25/2016 Cash$9,118 Money Market Funds$3,318 Mutual Funds$1,587 U.S. Treasury Securities$45,998 U.S. Agency Securities$7,511 Non-U.S. Government Securities$7,177 CDs and Time Deposits$3,729 Commercial Paper$4,708 Corporate Securities$128,898 Municipal Securities$961 Mortgage- and Asset-Backed Securities$18,515 Total: $231.52 billion The biggest slice of Apple’s portfolio is made up of corporate bonds, which at $128.9 billion comprise about 56% of the total. The accounting sticklers are technically correct when they say these bonds are not technically “cash.” They’re not. Unlike cash and U.S. Treasury securities, corporate bonds do have credit risk. But credit risk over a diversified bond portfolio is manageable and not particularly concerning. And that other great scourge of bond investors — interest rate risk — isn’t much of an issue because Apple intends to hold them until maturity. But let’s say that Apple needs to unload some of its bonds. As of quarter-end, AAPL was sitting on modest capital gains of about $1.3 billion on its total portfolio and about $750 million on its corporate bonds. So, even allowing for slight slippage due to transactions costs, Apple could liquidate its portfolio for cash if it needed to. But the key takeaway here is that Apple’s marketable securities — while not technically “cash” — are close enough to cash for our purposes here. These are bonds, CDs, money market funds and other conservative savings vehicles you might find in the proverbial widows-and-orphans portfolio. Bottom Line: Quit the Nitpicking Yes, while the Apple cash hoard may no longer awe us like it once did … frankly, it should. Apple has managed to maintain its war chest while also embarking on one of the most aggressive dividend and share repurchase programs in history. If all goes as planned, Apple will have delivered more than $300 billion to shareholders in dividends and repurchases by 2017 since starting the program in 2012. No matter how you slice it, that’s impressive. Charles Lewis Sizemore, CFA is the principal of Sizemore Capital Management, a registered investment adviser in Dallas, Texas.

World MEXICO & THE AMERICAS As Venezuela's farms and factories falter, the country struggles to feed its people Venezuela supermarket Juan Barreto / AFP/Getty Images Empty shelves in a supermarket in Caracas illustrate the ongoing food shortages afflicting Venezuela. Empty shelves in a supermarket in Caracas illustrate the ongoing food shortages afflicting Venezuela. (Juan Barreto / AFP/Getty Images) Chris Kraul and Mery Mogollon Just a decade ago, Venezuela was producing nearly all of the sugar it needed. But this week, 30,000 tons of imported Guatemalan sugar is being offloaded at the port city of Puerto Cabello for delivery to government-run supermarkets across the country, where desperate shoppers typically line up for hours to buy basic foodstuffs. In some ways, the sacks of sugar being lowered on pallets to waiting trucks at Dock 10 symbolize the plight of a country that has seen the production of sugar and other products plummet. Venezuela now imports 80% of all the sugar it consumes, and many economists say 17 years of socialist policies are to blame. Looting and unrest continue roiling Venezuela as shortages persist and protesters demand food Chris Kraul and Mery Mogollon Venezuela, where anger over food shortages is still mounting, continued to be roiled this week by angry protests and break-ins of grocery stores and businesses that have left five dead, at least 30  injured and 200 arrested, according to various news reports. The latest fatality came from the southwest... Venezuela, where anger over food shortages is still mounting, continued to be roiled this week by angry protests and break-ins of grocery stores and businesses that have left five dead, at least 30  injured and 200 arrested, according to various news reports. The latest fatality came from the southwest... (Chris Kraul and Mery Mogollon) Last year,  the country produced 242,306 tons of refined sugar, less than one-third of  the 740,000 tons produced in 2006 when the country came close to meeting annual consumer demand of 900,000 tons, according to figures from Fesoca, the Venezuelan sugar trade association. But 2006 also was the year that President Hugo Chavez nationalized 10 of the 16 privately owned sugar refineries and turned them over to worker cooperatives, part of his “21st Century Socialism” agenda. After taking office in 1999 and until his death in 2013, Chavez also seized thousands of acres of sugar cane plantations and made them communal properties. Comradely gestures to be sure, but sugar production has rapidly declined ever since the seizures. In May, scarcities got so bad that Coca-Cola temporarily suspended production of its popular line of soft drinks, saying it couldn’t buy enough supplies of the industrial sweetener. Sugar production isn’t the only sector battered by the policies instituted by Chavez and continued under his successor, President Nicolas Maduro. Beef, coffee, toothpaste, auto parts, toilet paper and various medicines are just some of the items that Venezuela once produced on a large scale and that now must be imported to meet domestic demand. At the same time productivity is plunging, the steep drop in global oil prices over the last two years has cut into oil revenue on which Venezuela depends for foreign currency and to bolster its budget. As a result, Maduro can’t afford to sufficiently increase imports of basic goods, which have already doubled from the mid-1990s, to meet consumer demand. The upshot: long lines of shoppers waiting hours outside stores to buy increasingly scarce household items. People line up to buy basic items outside a supermarket this week in Caracas. Once-booming Venezuela now suffers from shortages of food, medicine and basic goods. Juan Barreto / AFP/Getty Images People line up to buy basic items outside a supermarket this week in Caracas.

Once-booming Venezuela now suffers from shortages of food, medicine and basic goods. (Juan Barreto / AFP/Getty Images) Maduro insists it’s all the fault of an “economic war” waged by the United States. Juan Pablo Olalquiaga, president of Conindustria, the largest trade group of Venezuelan manufacturers, counters that industry has been decimated by nationalizations, government-imposed price and currency controls, as well as difficulties in obtaining component parts or materials to make things. The latter factor was cited by Kimberly Clark in July when the U.S.-based company announced it was closing its factory where it manufactured toilet paper, disposable diapers and feminine hygiene products. In a statement, the company said economic conditions in Venezuela made it “impossible” to do business here. Maduro called the closure illegal and promised to reopen and staff the factory with 1,000 laid-off workers, but analysts were skeptical that the factory would fare any better than the nationalized sugar mills. Kimberly Clark’s departure follows those of other multinationals since Maduro took office in 2013, including Clorox, Bridgestone, Procter & Gamble, General Mills and Ford, not to mention hundreds of domestic firms. Conindustria estimates that Venezuela has lost 1.2 million direct and indirect manufacturing jobs since 1999. “Two decades ago, Venezuela had 12,700 industrial companies,” Olalquiaga said. “Only 4,000 are left….The government of President Maduro has been absolutely incompetent in taking correct policies and so the deterioration of the few companies left has continued.” The auto industry has been hit especially hard. According to Cavenez, the Venezuelan automobile trade association, this year Venezuelan assembly lines are on course to produce around 4,000 cars. During the 1980s, Venezuela sometimes averaged upwards of  200,000 autos assembled yearly. Minister of Industry Carlos Farias, the Cabinet official in Maduro’s government responsible for managing the supply of consumer goods to the nation, is the latest to occupy the hot seat. His predecessor, Miguel Perez Abad, only lasted seven months on the job, and the minister before him, Luis Salas, for one month. Maduro’s appointment of Abad in January led some to think industrial policies might be redirected to stimulate private investment as a way to restart the country’s poor productivity.   But his abrupt firing Aug. 2, after making statements that seemed to presage free-market-friendlier policies, put an end to such optimism. Abad had favored liberalizing Venezuela’s currency laws and said in May that the government would cut down on imports to be able to pay its debts. See more of our top stories on Facebook » Maduro has hosted conferences with government officials and business leaders to attempt to “reactivate productive motors” and called on entrepreneurs to “break their piggy banks and bring your dollars.” But critics say he had done little to rectify the effects of nationalizations, price controls and scarcity of spare parts. So, any short-term reactivation of Venezuelan industry is a long shot and the economy could take years to recover. The International Monetary Fund expects inflation to reach 700% this year and the economy to shrink by 10 percentage points. The government will be hard pressed to pay $10 billion in foreign debt obligations this year. Meanwhile, Maduro’s Cabinet ministers accentuate the positive.  “Everything we have recovered is in the hands of the people,” said oil and mining minister  Eulogio Del Pino,  another Maduro hard-liner. “No steps backward.” Special correspondents Kraul and Mogollon reported from Bogota, Colombia, and Caracas, Venezuela, respectively.

Adblock Plus, which claims to be the most popular ad-blocking browser extension, has reacted to the social network’s move by accusing it of being “anti-user,” and that it “takes a dark path against user choice.” In a blog post, subtly titled “Oh well, looks like Facebook just got all anti-user,” Ben Williams, operations manager for Adblock Plus owner Eyeo, questioned just how effective ads were on Facebook. “It’s hard to imagine Facebook or the brands that are being advertised on its site getting any sort of value for their ad dollar here: publishers (like Facebook) alienate their audience and advertisers (the brands) allow their cherished brand name to be shoved down people’s throats. Yikes.” He also noted how Facebook described ads as “annoying” and “disruptive” in its own blog post. Williams may have a point; on the same day as Facebook’s announcement, Proctor and Gamble, the world’s largest ad spender, said it was moving away from targetted ads on the social network because they weren’t proving very effective. “We targeted too much and we went too narrow. And now we're looking at: What is the best way to get the most reach but also the right precision?" said P&G chief marketing officer Marc Pritchard to the Wall Street Journal. There’s a hint of hypocrisy about the outrage coming from Adblock Plus. Its controversial acceptable ads program allows companies to pay for their advertising to pass through the Adblock Plus filter. Eyoe has made a lot of money from the likes of Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Taboola, who make payments equivalent to 30 percent of ad revenues to be whitelisted.

There are very few things that are guaranteed in the investing world, but the best dividend stocks always come through for shareholders quarter after quarter. Source: Simon Cunningham via Flickr The biggest concern for investors searching for dividend stocks is that a company will cut its dividend at the first sign of financial hardship. As impressive as is for companies to maintain its dividends through thick and thin, some companies kick dividend reliability up a notch higher. Remarkably, a handful of blue-chip dividend stocks have an impeccable track record of more than 50 consecutive years of dividend hikes. That’s right, the Vietnam War, stagflation, two oil booms and busts, the Dot Com Bubble and the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression have come and gone, and these five dividend stocks have upped their payouts in each of the last 50 years. Five of the Most Reliable Dividend Stocks Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) owns popular brands like Motrin, Tylenol, Benadryl, Band-Aid and Listerine. The dividend stock currently yields 2.6% after an incredible 54 consecutive years of dividend hikes. 9 Stocks to Buy That Will Sprint Past Everything Else JNJ stock issued its most recent dividend hike in May, when its quarterly payment climbed from $0.75 to $0.80. In the last 50 years, the S&P 500 has produced a total return of 1,880%. In that same time, JNJ’s total return is a staggering 4,800%. In recent years, the dividend stock has shown no signs of slowing down. JNJ’s total return in the last decade is 94%, significantly greater than the S&P 500’s return of 70%. The Coca-Cola Co (KO) Not to be outdone, The Coca-Cola Co (NYSE:KO) stock has its own streak of 54 years of consecutive dividend hikes. In addition to Coca-Cola Classic, KO owns 19 other billion-dollar drink brands, including Dasani, Sprite, Powerade and Minute Maid. KO’s current yield is 3.2%, including its most recent quarterly dividend hike from $0.33 to $0.35 in March. KO stock has returned 3,050% in the past 50 years and 99% in the last 10 years. The company’s remarkable consistency has even caught the eye of Warren Buffett, one of the dividend stock’s largest investors. Lowe’s Companies, Inc. (LOW) When Lowe’s Companies, Inc.

But here’s a new idea -- the best ones are also marketers. They boost employer brand and improve the overall experience for employees. And when HR adopts marketing techniques, they can better manage talent. Here are the marketing principles every HR leader should incorporate: 1. Have a target audience. Marketers have a deep understanding of their audiences. They study demographics, attitudes and behaviors to create detailed customer personas and target messages to specific groups of people. Related: What HR Pros Need to Learn From the Rest of the Company HR can use the same strategy to better reach employees. After all, employees receive hundreds of emails every week -- yet 50 percent of those surveyed in theEMPLOYEEapp’s Mobile Trends in the Workplace survey said they still feel out of the loop. Why? Because the messages aren’t tapping into their interests. Start by learning everything about the employees targeted in the message. What motivates them? What are their goals? What do they value most? What are their concerns? What financial and non-financial “offers” will they respond to? How do these answers vary from department to department? Between managers and employees? Then, use this knowledge to target messages and HR programs to specific groups of employees, instead of sending generic information to everyone. For example, company announcements should look, feel and sound different depending on who the audience is -- different employees want different information in different ways. They want to know how it will affect them. How will it change their everyday work life? What’s in it for them? Let’s say the company is adding a new wellness program. The message to employees should outline the program and how it can benefit them. What are the rewards for participation? The message to team leaders, on the other hand, should outline ways to encourage their team to get involved. Think like a marketer to deliver the most relevant and important information to each employee. 2. Every channel. One brand voice. Marketers know that if they want to get the attention of their audience, they need to use more than one method. A campaign cannot be successful through emails and newsletters alone. Marketers use a mix of media to convey their messages. They use video, images, interactive websites, social media and more. In fact, the best marketing is viral -- it’s what other employees say about the programs. Related: A Comprehensive Guide to Building a Better Content Marketing Strategy And emails aren’t enough to reach employees. In theEMPLOYEEapp survey, 80 percent of employers said they use email to communicate, but 30 percent of employees said they ignore emails from their employer. According to Wrike’s 2016 Mobile Productivity Report, 90 percent of surveyed professionals believe a mobile device is critical to getting their jobs done. So use text messages, mobile apps, internal social networks and other mobile-optimized resources to communicate. Upload videos and pictures to engage employees in newsletters and announcements. Start a company blog and double down on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and other platforms employees use. The more ways employees can access and digest information, the better. But reaching everyone with a wide array of uncoordinated themes, benefits, colors, and tone seems scattered. Would P&G, Unilever, Disney or the best brand-builders in the world take a shotgun approach to building the value of their most important assets? Have a strategy and a voice, and have them show up in everything the company does. 3. Bring it all together. Marketers want to make the buying process easy for customers. And like marketers, HR wants employees to “buy” into programs, initiatives and benefits enrollment. It connects them to their work in broader ways. When HR focuses on a branded employee experience, encouraging program participation becomes easier. Bring all programs, initiatives and information together in one easy-to-use platform. Think of it as a hub that integrates the most important HR benefits, programs and initiatives in one convenient place. Employees don’t have to switch back and forth between multiple websites and keep track of information separately. When they can access everything in as few places as possible, participation becomes so much easier. And, in many cases, it’s much easier for employers to manage, too. 4. Measure effectiveness. Marketers track and measure everything to find the best strategies, adjust what isn’t working and get the most bang for their buck. Data is everything in modern marketing. Related: HR Analytics: How Should Big Data Be Used in the Workplace HR teams can also track and measure data to continually improve processes. Decide what metrics are most important to the company culture and overall business goals and track them to drive employee engagement. Are employees responding to messages? Are they getting the right messages at the right time? Are they participating in programs? Are they happy? What can be done better? Some new HR systems learn about people and take action so employers don’t even have to. HR isn’t an easy job. But when leaders look at it from a marketing perspective, HR strategies can improve the employee experience and build a consistent and strong employer brand.  Henry Albrecht Henry Albrecht is the CEO of Limeade, the corporate wellness technology company that measurably improves employee health, well-being and performance.

Alphabet’s birth was announced in a blog post by Google co-founder Larry Page on 10 August 2015. The missive makes clear that financial clarity drove the decision to restructure. Nevertheless, Page also wanted people to get “super excited” and for the entity to stand for something new. The markets have since rewarded Alphabet for clarity about how much money Google’s search activity was making against how much the pre-revenue moonshots were burning through: it briefly became the world’s most valuable company. But a year in is a good moment to ask what it has achieved vis a vis these other two objectives. An indicative answer is provided by The FutureBrand Index, an annual exercise where thousands of people worldwide rate the world’s 100 largest listed companies across 18 attributes. The companies are then ranked according to how positively each is perceived. Alphabet had inherited Google’s listing but we threw in Google for good measure, to compare impressions. As an early verdict on Alphabet in brand strategy terms, the results are not encouraging. Whereas Google had topped the Index in previous years and would have done so again in 2016, Alphabet sank to position 21. Apple now moved up to occupy the first position, leading Alphabet even more emphatically in perception than in valuation terms. Further, people are projecting what they know of Google onto Alphabet because the perception profiles of both entities are very similar, ie they are both relatively stronger in the same attributes. However, what is particularly worrying is that Alphabet comes 25th in terms of the innovation attribute in isolation, when innovation is the very thing the restructure was designed to foster. In sum, it appears that people simultaneously struggle to distinguish Alphabet from its predecessor and are not as excited by it. This matters. Research by Weber Shandwick concluded that corporate brand is as important as product brand when it comes to purchase decisions. Buyers, whether businesses or consumers, take account of the reputations of parent companies. Further, our own research has demonstrated a correlation between positive perceptions and stock market out-performance over time. These factors, along with the need to be employers of choice, is why there has been so much effort on the part of ‘house of brands’ corporations such as P&G and Unilever to seek the advantages accruing to strong ‘master brand’ companies such as IBM, Nike and Apple. An enhanced profile resting on a clearly defined purpose that unites its otherwise disparate brands can be the right approach to position a parent company and its subsidiaries for future success. In fact, Google was well placed to pursue the master brand strategy, having accrued enormously positive associations and with several sister companies already sharing the Google name (eg Google X and Google Ideas, now ‘X’ and ‘Jigsaw’ respectively). But its founders opted instead for a new vehicle: a parent that stays out of the limelight to let its subsidiary brands shine. At the same time they willed it to be an enthusiasm-inducing and eminently investable proposition, only in the absence of a public interface and with no discernible push to shape perceptions. Looking ahead, any halo effect Alphabet enjoys as Google’s new incarnation will likely further wane. Moreover, allowing the view to persist that Alphabet is Google by another name surely runs counter to the founders’ intentions. That is why in entering year two it would serve Alphabet well to weave a compelling narrative beyond the financial one, that connects its burgeoning family of companies. A narrowly focused Google, shorn of cutting-edge activities, must for its part guard against becoming perceived as a mundane internet advertising company. The new name and company structure has created challenges when such a move is typically designed to resolve them, because of negative associations with a sector for example (think Philip Morris being reinvented as Altria). Google had no such problems in 2015 so we must wait to see if the move becomes a masterstroke or an unforced error. Because of the early uncertainty however, Alphabet only scores a B for its brand strategy.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Jacob Bogage August 10 Follow jacobbogage Internet and advertising research firm ComScore shuffled its leadership team Wednesday, tapping company co-founder Gian Fulgoni as chief executive and naming a new chairman and chief financial officer. The changes come as the Reston, Va.-based firm has delayed reporting its financial results in the wake of an inquiry into its accounting practices. “The first half of 2016 was not business as usual for the company because of the distraction caused by the investigation,” Fulgoni said in a conference call Wednesday with analysts, according to a transcript. Fulgoni said the board agreed to put in place new leadership “that’s fully dedicated to operating the business with only minimal distraction.” ComScore, which specialized in measuring Internet and advertising traffic across computers, cellphones and other devices, began a probe in February into how it reported unspecified “nonmonetary revenue,” or transactions with no money attached. The company said co-founder Magid Abraham resigned as executive chairman last month to focus on his work as executive chairman of APX Labs and his work as a visiting scholar at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. (He remains on the ComScore board). On Wednesday, it said CEO Serge Matta would become executive vice chairman and become an adviser to Fulgoni. Former Procter & Gamble executive Joan M. Lewis was named chairman, and David Chemerow assumed the role of chief financial officer. The company said it would postpone financial reports until the conclusion of its in-house investigation. “The internal investigation is substantially complete, and the Audit Committee has identified certain areas of potential concern, including with respect to certain accounting and disclosure practices and controls that the Company, with input from its consultants and counsel, is further analyzing,” the company said in a filing Wednesday with the Securities and Exchange Commission.   business business true Please provide a valid email address.

 16-year-old Laurie Hernandez winked at the judges before one of the biggest routines of her life Cork Gaines Aug. 9, 2016, 5:36 PM 41,306 facebook linkedin twitter email print Charlie Riedel/AP Laurie Hernandez may be the youngest member of the US women's gymnastics team, but that doesn't mean that the spotlight of the Rio Olympics is going to make her nervous. With the women's team cruising to their second-straight gold medal in the women's team all-around competition, Hernandez stepped up for her floor-exercise routine. Despite being just 16 and in her first Olympics, she took a moment to let the judges know that she was ready in a very confident way: She winked at them. NBCOlympics.com That wink is amazing. The little grin at the end is even better. Hernandez went on to score a 14.833 on the floor exercise, the highest score of the day up to that point. The women's team went on to win the gold by more than eight points, an enormous margin in a sport where scores are measured to the thousandth of a point. That's crazy. Amazingly, this is not the first time when one of the gymnasts had a memorable wink during a floor routine. During the P&G Gymnastics Championships in June, Simone Biles took a moment in the middle of her routine to wink at a teammate, as if to say, "It's good, I got this." Yes, @simonebiles we caught the wink ;) hahaha love it! Check out the full video on YouTube!

Say What!? Previous Brands Beat Generics Next How I Learned to Start Loving Social Media's Darkside Facebook's Panda Update So far this year publishers have lost 52% their Facebook distribution due to: increased ad load (another record quarter for Facebook!!!) shifting of the news feed "relevancy" algorithm toward friends promotion of new formats, like live video (if they subsidize it with direct payments, they're also algorithmically subsidizing its distribution) Instant Articles may have worked for an instant, but many publishers are likely where they were before they made the Faustian bargain, except they now have less control over their content distribution and advertising while having the higher cost structure of supporting another content format. When Facebook announced their news feed update to fight off clickbait headlines, it sure sounded a lot like the equivalent of Google's Panda update. Glenn Gabe is one of the sharpest guys in the SEO field who regularly publishes insightful content & doesn't blindly shill for the various platform monopolies dominating the online publishing industry & he had the same view I did. Wow, just realized this is a Panda-like Facebook algo update. "posts shared from domains & Pages will appear lower" https://t.co/IurVgPeL8D— Glenn Gabe (@glenngabe) August 4, 2016 Further cementing the "this is Panda" view was an AdAge article quoting some Facebook-reliant publishers. Glad we have already shifted our ways. Nice to see them moving in the same direction we are. etc. ... It felt like reading a Richard Rosenblatt quote in 2011 about Demand Media's strong working relationship with Google or how right after Panda their aggregate traffic level was flat. January 27, 2011 Peter Kafka: Do you think that Google post was directed at you in any way? Richard Rosenblatt: It’s not directed at us in any way. P K: they wrote this post, which talks about content farms, and even though you say they weren’t talking about you, it left a lot of people scratching their heads. R R: Let’s just say that we know what they’re trying to do. ... He’s talking about duplicate, non-original content. Every single piece of ours is original. ... our relationship is synergistic, and it’s a great partnership. May 9, 2011 Kara Swisher: What were you trying to communicate in the call, especially since investors seemed very focused on Panda? R R: What I also wanted to show was that third-party data sources should not be relied on. We did get affected, for sure. But I was not just being optimistic, we wanted to use that to really understand what we can do better. K S: Given Google’s shift in its algorithm, are you shifting your distribution, such as toward social and mobile? R R: If you look at where trends are going, that’s where we are going to be. K S: How are you changing the continued perception that Demand is a content farm? R R: I don’t think anyone has defined what a content farm is and I am not sure what it means either. We obviously don’t think we are a content farm and I am not sure we can counter every impact if some people think we are. A couple years later Richard Rosenblatt left the company. Since the Google Panda update eHow has removed millions of articles from their site. As a company they remain unprofitable a half-decade later & keep seeing YoY media ad revenue declines in the 30% to 40% range. Over-reliance on any platform allows that platform to kill you. And, in most cases, you are unlikely to be able to restore your former status until & unless you build influence via other traffic channels: I think in general, media companies have lost sight of building relationships with their end users that will bring them in directly, as opposed to just posting links on social networks and hoping people will click. I think publishers that do that are shooting themselves in the foot. Media companies in general are way too focused on being where our readers are, as opposed to being so necessary to our readers that they will seek us out. - Jessica Lessin, founder of TheInformation Recovering former status requires extra investment far above and beyond what led to the penalty. And if the core business model still has the same core problems there is no solution. "I feel pretty confident about the algorithm on Suite 101." - Matt Cutts Some big news publishers are trying to leverage video equivalents of a Narrative Science or Automated Insights (from Wochit and Wibbitz) to embed thousands of autogenerated autoplay videos in their articles daily. But is that a real long-term solution to turn the corner? Even if they see a short term pop in ad revenues by using some dumbed-down AI-enhanced low cost content, all that really does is teach people that they are a source of noise while increasing the number of web users who install ad blockers. And the whole time penalized publishers try to recover the old position of glory, the platform monopolies are boosting their AI skills in the background while they eat the playing field. The companies which run the primary ad networks can easily get around the ad blockers, but third party publishers can't. As the monopoly platforms broadly defund ad-based publishing, they can put users "in control" while speaking about taking the principle-based approach: “This isn’t motivated by inventory; it’s not an opportunity for Facebook from that perspective,” Mr. Bosworth said. “We’re doing it more for the principle of the thing. We want to help lead the discussion on this.” ... Mr. Bosworth said Facebook hasn't paid any ad-blocking software company to have its ads pass through their filters and that it doesn’t intend to. Google recently worked out a deal with Wikimedia to actually cite the source of the content shown in the search results: it hasn’t always been the easiest to see that the material came from Wikipedia while on mobile devices. At the Wikimedia Foundation, we’ve been working to change that. While the various platforms ride the edge on what is considered reasonable disclosure, regulatory bodies crack down on individuals participating on those platforms unless they are far more transparent than the platforms are: Users need to be clear when they're getting paid to promote something, and hashtags like #ad, #sp, #sponsored --common forms of identification-- are not always enough. The whole "eating the playing field" is a trend which is vastly under-reported, largely because almost everyone engaged in the ecosystem needs to sell they have some growth strategy. The reality is as the platform gets eaten it only gets harder to build a sustainable business. The mobile search interface is literally nothing but ads in most key categories. More ads. Larger ads. Nothing but ads. And a bit of scrape after the ads to ensure the second or third screen still shows zero organic results. @glenngabe those SERPs look even sexier when there are 3 or 4 AdWords above the knowledge graph. pic.twitter.com/tjdCuPBrCQ— aaron wall (@aaronwall) June 22, 2016 And more scraping, across more categories. Google monopolist not satisfied with above the fold they've now claimed "page 2" cc @kaufer #byeorganic pic.twitter.com/qGXmt2Z5K5— Jeremy Stoppelman (@jeremys) August 5, 2016 What's more, even large scaled companies in big money fields are struggling to monetize mobile users. On the most recent quarterly conference call TripAdvisor executives stated they monetize mobile users at about 30% the rate they monetize desktop or tablet users. What happens when the big brand advertisers stop believing in the narrative of the value of precise user tracking? We may soon find out: P&G two years ago tried targeting ads for its Febreze air freshener at pet owners and households with large families. The brand found that sales stagnated during the effort, but rose when the campaign on Facebook and elsewhere was expanded last March to include anyone over 18. ... P&G’s push to find broader reach with its advertising is also evident in the company’s recent increases in television spending. Toward the end of last year P&G began moving more money back into television, according to people familiar with the matter. For mobile to work well you need to be a destination & a habit. But there is tiny screen space and navigational searches are also re-routed through Google hosted content (which will, of course, get monetized). In fact, what would happen to an advertiser if they partnered with other advertisers to prevent brand bidding? Why that advertiser would get sued by the FTC for limiting user choice: The bidding agreements harm consumers, according to the complaint, by restraining competition for, and distorting the prices of, advertising in relevant online auctions, by reducing the number of relevant, useful, truthful and non-misleading advertisements, by restraining competition among online sellers of contact lenses, and in some cases, by resulting in consumers paying higher retail prices for contact lenses. If the above restraint of competition & market distortion is worth suing over, how exactly can Google make the mobile interface AMP exclusive without earning a similar lawsuit? AMP content presented in the both sections will be “de-duplicated” in order to avoid redundancies, Google says. The move is significant in that AMP results will now take up an entire phone screen, based on the example Google shows in its pitch deck. Are many publishers in a rush to support Google AMP after the bait-n-switch on Facebook Instant Articles?

Mark Zuckerberg’s social-networking giant said on Tuesday it will begin thwarting ad-blocking software on its site, escalating a battle between advertisers and users who are annoyed by ads. Facebook said that while it will protect ads from being blocked, it also is striving to make ads less annoying by making them more relevant and beneficial to users. “What we’ve heard is that people don’t like to see ads that are irrelevant to them or that disrupt or break their experience,” Andrew Bosworth, vice president of ads and business platform, wrote in a blog post. Accordingly, Facebook is introducing “tools to help people control their experience,” he said, by, for example, letting them opt out of seeing certain kinds of ads. Separately, Procter & Gamble told the Wall Street Journal Tuesday it is cutting back its use of targeted ads on Facebook, saying they weren’t effective. P&G added, however, that it isn’t reducing its overall ad spending on Facebook.

 Your readers don't like being lied to Myles Udland Aug. 11, 2016, 9:18 AM 1,113 facebook linkedin twitter email print Here's an interesting chart from Mark May and the team at Citi.  Looking at branded content — specifically as it relates to Facebook's opportunity in the space — Citi found that 48% of US internet users felt deceived upon realizing an article or video was not a piece of news or commentary, but was in fact a commercial.  Certainly, readers don't like being lied to. This is more or less a standard human response. What else this chart tells us is a bit less clear. For instance: Do the 32% of users who clicked an ad they thought was an article but don't feel deceived enjoy the ad? Do they buy something from the ad? What about the 20% who don't know? Is it because "branded content" is sort of nonsense jargon people outside the advertising/media industry simply don't understand? And so on.  Citi More broadly, May's read on the branded content space for Facebook is that by clarifying its policies around these kinds of ads the company opens up opportunities for revenue inside of its Newsfeed. May notes that Facebook announced changes to its policies in April.  "The new rules will make the sponsorship nature of this type of content more transparent to users, and also clarify how media partners can better monetize this form of advertising across the Facebook network (note that the guidelines apply to many platforms, including Instant Articles and live videos)," May writes. "As such, we see this as a win-win-win for FB users, FB media partners/advertisers, and for FB itself." Earlier this week, reports indicated that Procter & Gamble, the world's biggest ad spender, would cut down on the number of targeted ads it placed on Facebook but not reduce its total spend on the platform.  The implication here, it seems, is that P&G feels branded content will be more effective. Particularly if readers don't feel deceived.  SEE ALSO: P&G, the world's biggest ad spender, is cutting back on targeted Facebook ads because they weren't effective NOW WATCH: Elon Musk just unveiled something that could revolutionize how you power your home Loading video...

 Adblock Plus says Facebook's decision to block ad blockers is 'anti-user' Lara O'Reilly Aug. 10, 2016, 5:50 AM 6,124 facebook linkedin twitter email print Eyeo communications and operations manager Ben Williams. Adblock Plus Adblock Plus has reacted to the news that Facebook is going to prevent ad blocking software from working on its desktop site by accusing the social network of becoming "anti-user." Facebook announced Tuesday it was updating its tech to circumvent ad blocking software on its website. At the same time, Facebook said it will update its ad preferences tools to make it easier for individuals to tailor the types of ads that are served to them on the site.  Adblock Plus says the move "takes a dark path against user choice." Writing in a blog post entitled "Oh well, looks like Facebook just got all anti-user," Adblock Plus owner Eyeo's communications and operations manager Ben Williams pointed out that Facebook's own blog post announcing the changes says the primary reason people use ad blockers is to "stop annoying, disruptive ads." Williams says this shows there is good reason for consumers to download ad blockers and questions why, therefore, users are being prevented from deciding what they can and can't block. He continued: "In any case, it’s hard to imagine Facebook or the brands that are being advertised on its site getting any sort of value for their ad dollar here: publishers (like Facebook) alienate their audience and advertisers (the brands) allow their cherished brand name to be shoved down people’s throats. Yikes." Facebook first admitted it was starting to worry about ad blocker users back in January, highlighting in its annual 10-K filing that they have impacted its ad revenue "from time to time"  Meanwhile on Tuesday, Procter & Gamble, the world's largest ad spender, said it was cutting down on targeted Facebook ads. P&G chief marketing officer Marc Pritchard told The Wall Street Journal: ""We targeted too much and we went too narrow. And now we're looking at: What is the best way to get the most reach but also the right precision?" Update: On Thursday, Adblock Plus said users have figured out a workaround that will see its ad blocker (and others) work on Facebook's desktop site.

Say What!? Previous Reinventing SEO Next Brands Beat Generics Neofeudal Web Publishing Best Practices Guide At the abstract level, if many people believe in something then it will grow. The opposite is also true. And in a limitless, virtual world, you can not see what is not there. The Yahoo Directory Before I got into search, the Yahoo! Directory was so important to the field of search there were entire sessions at SES conferences on how to get listed & people would even recommend using #1AAA-widgets.com styled domains to alphaspam listings to the top of the category. The alphaspam technique was a carry over from yellow page directories - many of which have went through bankruptcy as attention & advertising shifted to the web. Go to visit the Yahoo! Directory today and you get either a server error, a security certificate warning, or a redirect to aabacosmallbusiness.com. Poof. It's gone. Before the Yahoo! Directory disappeared their quality standards were vastly diminished. As a webmaster who likes to test things, I tried submitting sites of various size and quality to different places. Some sites which would get rejected by some $10 directories were approved in the Yahoo! Directory. The Yahoo! Directory also had a somewhat weird setting where if you canceled a directory listing in the middle of the term they would often keep it listed for many years to come - for free. After many SEOs became fearful of links the directory saw vastly reduced rates of submissions & many existing listings canceled their subscriptions, thus leaving it as a service without much of a business model. DMOZ At one point Google's webmaster guidelines recommended submitting to DMOZ and the Yahoo! Directory, but that recommendation led to many lesser directories sprouting up & every few years Google would play a whack-a-mole game and strip PageRank or stop indexing many of them. Many have presumed DMOZ was on its last legs many times over the past decade. But on their 18th birthday they did a spiffy new redesign. Different sections of the site use different color coding and the design looks rather fresh and inviting. Take a look. However improved the design is, it is unlikely to reverse this ranking trend. Lacking Engagement Why did those rankings decline though? Was it because the sites suck? Or was it because the criteria to rank changed? If the sites were good for many years it is hard to believe the quality of the sites all declined drastically in parallel. What happened is as engagement metrics started getting folded in, sites that only point you to other sites become an unneeded step in the conversion funnel, in much the same way that Google scrubbed affiliates from the AdWords ecosystem as unneeded duplication. What is wrong with the user experience of a general web directory? There isn't any single factor, but a combination of them... the breadth of general directories means their depth must necessarily be limited. general directory category pages ranking in search results is like search results in search results. it isn't great from the user's perspective. if a user already knows a category well they would likely prefer to visit a destination site rather than a category page. if a user doesn't already know a category, then they would prefer to use an information source which prioritizes listing the best results first. the layout for most general web directories is a list of results which are typically in alphabetical order rather than displaying the best result first in order to sound authoritative many directories prefer to use a neutral tone If a directory mostly links to lower quality sites Google can choose to either not index it or not trust links from it. And even if a directory generally links to trustworthy sites, Google doesn't need to rank it to extract most the value from it. The trend of lower traffic to the top tier general directory sites has happened across the board. Many years ago Google's remote rater guidelines cited Joeant as a trustworthy directory. Their traffic chart looks like this. And the same sort of trend is true for BOTW, Business.com, GoGuides.org, etc. There is basically nothing a general web directory can do to rank well in Google on a sustainable basis, at least not in the English language. Even if you list every school in the city of Winnipeg that page can't rank if it isn't indexed & even if it is indexed it won't rank well if your site has a Panda-related ranking issue. There are a couple other issues with such a comprehensive page: each additional listing is more editorial content cost in terms of building the page AND maintaining the page the bigger the page gets the more a user needs something other than alphabetical order as a sort option the more listings there are in a tight category the more the likelihood there will be excessive keyword repetition on the page which could get the page flagged for algorithmic demotion, even if the publisher has no intent to spam. Simply listing things by their name will mean repeating a word like "school" over 100 times on the above linked Winnipeg schools page. If you don't consciously attempt to lower the count a page like that could have the term repeated over 300 times. Knock On Effects In addition to those web directories getting fewer paid submissions, most are likely seeing a rise in link removal requests. Google's "fear first" approach to relevancy has even led them to listing DMOZ as an unnatural link source in warning emails to webmasters. What's more, many people who use automated link clean up tools take the declining traffic charts & low rankings of the sites as proof that the links lack value or quality. That means anyone who gets hit by a penalty & ends up in warning messages not only ends up with less traffic while penalized, but they also get extra busy work to do while trying to fix whatever the core problem is. And in many cases fixing the core problem is simply unfeasible without a business model change. When general web directories are defunded it not only causes many of them to go away, but it also means other related sites and services disappear. Editors of those web directories who were paid to list quality sites for free. Web directory review sites. SEOs, internet marketers & other businesses which listed in those directories Now perhaps general web directories no longer really add much value to the web & they are largely unneeded. But there are other things which are disappearing in parallel which were certainly differentiated & valuable, though perhaps not profitable enough to maintain the "relevancy" footprint to compete in a brand-first search ecosystem. Depth vs Breadth Unless you are the default search engine (Google) or the default social network everyone is on (Facebook), you can't be all things to all people. If you want to be differentiated in a way that turns you into a destination you can't compete on a similar feature set because it is unlikely you will be able to pay as much for traffic-driven partnerships as the biggest players can. Can niche directories or vertical directories still rank well? Sure, why not. Sites like Yelp & TripAdvisor have succeeded in part by adding interactive elements which turned them into sought after destinations. Part of becoming a destination is intentionally going out of their way to *NOT* be neutral platforms. Consider how many times Yelp has been sued by businesses which claimed the sales team did or was going to manipulate the displayed reviews if the business did not buy ads. Users tend to trust those platforms precisely because other users may leave negative reviews & that (usually) offers something better than a neutral and objective editorial tone. And that user demand for those reviews, of course, is why Google stole reviews from those sorts of sites to try to prop up the Google local places pages. It was a point of differentiation which was strong enough that people wanted it over Google. So Google tried to neutralize the advantage. Blogs The above section is about general directories, but the same concept applies to almost any type of website. Consider blogs. A decade ago feed readers were commonplace, bloggers often cross-linked & bloggers largely drove the conversation which bubbled up through mainstream media. Google Reader killed off RSS feed readers by creating a fast, free & ad-free competitor. Then Google abruptly shut down Google Reader. Not only do whimsical blogs like Least Helpful or Cute Overload arbitrarily shut down, but people like Chris Pirillo who know tech well suggest blogging is (at least economically) dead. Many of the people who are quitting are not the dumb, the lazy, and the undifferentiated. Rather many are the wise trend-aware players who are highly differentiated yet find it impossible to make the numbers work: The conversation started when revenues were down, and I had to carry payroll for a month or two out of my personal account, which I had not had to do since shortly after we started this whole project. We tweaked some things (added an ad or two which we had stripped back for the redesign, reminded people about ad-blockers and their impact on our ability to turn a profit, etc.) and revenue went back up a bit, but for a hot minute, you’ll remember I was like: “Theoretically, if this industry went further into the ground which it most assuredly will, would we want to keep running the site as a vanity project? Probably not! We would just stop doing it.” In the current market Google can conduct a public relations campaign on a topic like payday loans, have their PR go viral & then if you mention "oh yeah, so Google is funding the creation of doorway pages to promote payday loans" it goes absolutely nowhere, even if you do it DURING THE NEWS CYCLE. So much of what exists is fake that anything new is evaluated from the perception of suspicion. While the real (and important) news stories go nowhere & the PR distortions spread virally, the individual blogger ends up feeling a bit soulless if they try to make ends meet: "The American Mama reached tens of thousands of readers monthly, and under that name I worked with hundreds of big name brands on sponsored campaigns. I am a member of virtually every ‘blog network’ and agency that “connects brands with bloggers”. ... What’s the point of having your own space to write if you’re being paid to sound like you work for a corporation? ... PR Friendly says “For the right price, I will be anyone you want me to be.” ... I’m not saying blogging is dying, but this specific little monster branch of it, sponsored content disguised as horribly written “day in the life” stories about your kids and pets? It can’t possibly last. Do you really want to be stuck on the inside when it crumbles?" If you can't get your own site to grow enough to matter then maybe it makes sense to contribute to someone else's to get your name out there. I recently received this unsolicited email: "Hello! This is Theodore, a writer and chief editor at SomeSiteName.Com I noticed that you are accepting paid reviews online and you will be glad to know that now you can also publish your Sponsored content to SomeSite via me. SomeSite.Com is a leading website which deals in Technology, Social Media, Internet Stuff and Marketing. It was also tagged as Top 10 _____ websites of 2016 by [a popular magazine]. Website Stats- Alexa Rank: [below 700] Google PageRank: 6/10 Monthly Pageviews: 5+ Million Domain Authority: 85+ Price : $500 via PayPal (Once off Payment) Let me know if you are interested and want to feature your website product like nothing! This will not only increase your traffic but increase in overall SEO Score as well. Thanks" That person was not actually a member of that site's team, but they had found a way to get their content published on it. In part because that sort of stuff exists, Google tries to minimize the ability for reputation to flow across sites. The large platforms are so smug, so arrogant, they actually state the following sort of crap in interviews: "There's a space in the world for art, but that's different from trying to build products at scale. The one thing that does make me a little nervous is a lot of my designer friends are still focused building websites and I'm not sure that's a growth business anymore. If you look at people who are doing interesting work, they tend to be building inside these platforms like Facebook and finding ways to do interesting work in there. For instance, journalists. Instant Articles is a really great way for stories to be told." Sure you can bust your ass to build up Facebook, but when their business model changes (bye social gaming companies, hello live streaming video) best of luck trying to follow them. And if you starve during the 7 lean years in between when your business model is once again well aligned with Facebook you can't go back in time to give yourself a meal to un-starve. Content Farms Ehow.com has removed *MILLIONS* of pages of content since getting hit by Panda. And yet their ranking chart looks like this What is crazy is the above chart actually understates the actual declines, because the shift of search to mobile & increasing prevalence of ads in the search results means estimates of organic search traffic may be overstated significantly compared to a few years prior. A half-decade ago a bootstrapped eHow competitor named ArticlesBase got some buzz in TechCrunch because they were making about $500,000 a month on about 20 million monthly unique visitors. That business was recently listed on Flippa. They are getting about a half-million unique monthly visitors (off 95%) and about $2,000 a month in revenues (off about 99.6%). The negative karma with that site (in terms of ability to rank) is so bad that the site owner suggested on Flippa to publish any new content from new authors onto different websites: "its not going to get to 0 as most of the traffic is not google today, but we would suggest to push out the fresh daily incoming content to new sites - thats where the growth is." Now a person could say "eHow deserves to die" and maybe they are right. BUT one could easily counter that point by noting... the public who owns the shares owns the ongoing losses & many top insiders cashed out long ago Google was getting a VIG on eHow on their ride up & is still collecting one on the way down (along with funding other current parallel projects from the very same people with the very same Google ad network) Demand Media's partner program where they syndicate eHow-like content to newspapers like USA Today keeps growing at 15% to 20% a year (similar process, author, content, business model, etc. ... only a different URL hosting the content) look at this and you'll see how many publishing networks are still building the same sort of content but are cross-marketing across networks of sites. What's more some of the same names are at the new plays. For example, Demand Media's founder was the chairman of an SEO firm bought by Hearst publishing & his wife is on the about us page of Evolve Media's ModernMom.com The wrappers around the content & masthead logos change, but by and large the people and strategies don't change anywhere near as quickly. Web Portals & News Sites As the mainstream media gets more desperate, they are more willing to partner with the likes of Demand Media to get any revenue they can. You see the reality of this desperation in the stock charts for newspaper companies. Or how about this chart for Yahoo.com. It doesn't look particularly bad, especially if you consider that Yahoo has shut down many of their vertical sites. Underlying flat search traffic charts misses declining publisher CPMs and the click traffic mix shift away from organic toward paid search channels as search traffic shifts to mobile devices & Google relentlessly increases the size of the search ads. Yahoo may still rank #3 for keyword x, but if that #3 ranking is below the fold on both mobile and desktop devices they might need to rank #1 to get as much traffic as #3 got a couple years ago. Yahoo! was once the leading search portal & now they are worth about 1/5th of LinkedIn (after backing out their equity stakes in Alibaba and Yahoo! Japan). The chart is roughly flat, but the company is up for a fire sale because organic search result displacement & the value of traffic has declined quicker than Yahoo! can fire employees & none of their Hail Mary passes worked. Ms. Mayer compared the [Polyvore] deal to Google’s acquisition of YouTube in 2006, arguing that “you can never overpay” for a company with the potential to land a huge new base of users. ... “Her core mistake was this belief that she could reinvent Yahoo,” says a former senior executive who left the company last year. “There was an element of her being a true believer when everyone else had stopped.” The same line of thinking was used to justify the Tumblr acquisition, which has went nowhere fast - just like their 50+ other acquisitions. Yahoo! shut down many verticals, fired many workers, sold off some real estate & is exploring selling their patents. Chewing Up the Value Chain Smaller devices that are harder to use means the gateways have to try to add more features to maintain relevance. As they add features, publishers get displaced: The Web will only expand into more aspects of our lives. It will continue to change every industry, every company, and every life on the planet. The Web we build today will be the foundation for generations to come. It’s crucial we get this right. Do we want the experiences of the next billion Web users to be defined by open values of transparency and choice, or the siloed and opaque convenience of the walled garden giants dominating today? And if converting on mobile is hard or inconvenient, many people will shift to the defaults they know & trust, thus choosing to buy on Amazon rather than a smaller ecommerce website. One of my friends who was in ecommerce for many years stated this ultimately ended up becoming the problem with his business. People would email him back and forth about the product, related questions, and basically go all the way through the sales process with getting him to answer every concern & recommend each additional related product needed, then at the end they would ask him to price match Amazon & if he couldn't they would then buy from Amazon. If he had more scale he might have been able to get a better price from suppliers and compete with Amazon on price, but his largest competitor who took out warehouse space also filed for bankruptcy because they were unable to make the interest payments on their loans. We live in a society which over-values ease-of-use & scale while under-valuing expertise. Look at how much consolidation there has been in the travel market since Google Flights launched & Google went pay-to-play with hotel search. Expedia owns Travelocity & Orbitz. Priceline owns Kayak. Yahoo! Travel simply disappeared. TripAdvisor is strong, but even they were once a part of Expedia. How different are the remaining OTAs? One could easily argue they are less differentiated than this article about the history of the travel industry makes Skift against other travel-related news sites. How many markets are strong enough to support the creation of that sort of featured editorial content? Not many. And most companies which can create that sort of in-depth content leverage the higher margins on shallower & cheaper content to pay for that highly differentiated featured content creation. But if the knowledge graph and new search features are simply displacing the result set the number of people who will be able to afford creating that in-depth featured content is only further diminished. Over 5 years ago Bing's Stefan Weitz mentioned they wanted to move search from a web of nouns to a web of verbs & to "look at the web as a digital representation of the physical world." Some platforms are more inclusive than Google is & decide to partner rather than displace, but Bing's partnership with Yelp or TripAdvisor doesn't help you if you are a direct competitor of Yelp or TripAdvisor, or if your business was heavily reliant on one of these other channels & you fall out of favor with them. Chewing Up Real Estate There are so many enhanced result features in the search results it is hard to even attempt to make an exhaustive list. As search portals rush to add features they also rush to grab real estate & outright displace the concept of "10 blue links." There has perhaps been nothing which captured the sentiment better than .@mattcutts I think I have spotted one, Matt. Note the similarities in the content text: pic.twitter.com/uHux3rK57f— dan barker (@danbarker) February 27, 2014 The following is paraphrased, but captures the intent to displace the value chain & the roll of publishers. "the journeys of users. their desire to be taken and sort of led and encouraged to proceed, especially on mobile devices (but I wouldn't say only on mobile devices). ... there are a lot of users who are happy to be provided with encouragement and leads to more and more interesting information and related, grouped in groups, leading lets say from food to restaurants, from restaurants to particular types of restaurants, from particular types of restaurants to locations of those types of restaurants, ordering, reservations. I'm kind of hungry, and in a few minutes you've either ordered food or booked a table. Or I'm kind of bored, and in a few minutes you've found a book to read or a film to watch, or some other discovery you are interested in." - Andrey Lipattsev What role do publishers have in the above process? Unpaid data sources used to train algorithms at Facebook & Google? Individually each of these assistive search feature roll outs may sound compelling, but ultimately they defund publishing. Looks like Symptom Cards will lead to additional, more-focused searches (& not to third party sites.) #seo pic.twitter.com/vhkz5ZflMJ— Glenn Gabe (@glenngabe) June 20, 2016 Not a "Google Only" Problem People may think I am unnecessarily harsh toward Google in my views, but this sort of shift is not a Google-only thing. It is something all the large online platforms are doing. I simply give Google more coverage because they have a history of setting standards & moving the market, whereas a player like Yahoo! is acting out of desperation to simply try to stay alive. The market capitalization of the companies reflect this. Google & Facebook control the ecosystem. Everyone else is just following along. "digital is eating legacy media, mobile is eating digital, and two companies, Facebook and Google, are eating mobile. ... Since 2011, desktop advertising has fallen by about 10 percent, according to Pew. Meanwhile mobile advertising has grown by a factor of 30 ... Facebook and Google, control half of net mobile ad revenue." - Derek Thompson The same sort of behavior is happening in China, where Google & Facebook are prohibited from competing. As publishers get displaced and defunded online platforms can literally buy the media: “There’s very little downside. Even if we lose money it won’t be material,” Alibaba's Mr. Tsai said. “But the upside [in buying SCMP] is quite interesting.” The above quote was on Alibaba buying the newspaper of record in Hong Kong. As bad as entire industries becoming token purchases may sound, that is the optimistic view. :D Facebook's Instant Articles and Google's AMP those make a token purchase unnecessary: "I don't think it's any secret that you're going to see a bloodbath in the next 12 months," Vice Media's Shane Smith said, referring to digital media and broadcast TV. "Facebook has bought two-thirds of the media companies out there without spending a dime." Those services can dictate what gets exposure, how it is monetized, and then adjust the exposure and revenue sharing over time to keep partners desperate & keep them hooked. “If Thiel and Nick Denton were just a couple of rich guys fighting over a 1st Amendment edge case, it wouldn't be very interesting. But Silicon Valley has unprecedented, monopolistic power over the future of journalism. So much power that its moral philosophy matters.” - Nate Silver Give them just enough (false) hope to stay partnered. All the while track user data more granularly & run AI against it to disintermediate & devalue partners. TV networks are aware of the risks of disintermediation and view Netflix with more suspicion than informed SEOs view Google: for all the original shows Netflix has underwritten, it remains dependent on the very networks that fear its potential to destroy their longtime business model in the way that internet competitors undermined the newspaper and music industries. Now that so many entertainment companies see it as an existential threat, the question is whether Netflix can continue to thrive in the new TV universe that it has brought into being. ... “ ‘Breaking Bad’ was 10 times more popular once it started streaming on Netflix.” - Michael Nathanson ... the networks couldn’t walk away from the company either. Many of them needed licensing fees from Netflix to make up for the revenue they were losing as traditional viewership shrank. And just like Netflix, Facebook will move into original content production. The Wiki Wikipedia is certainly imperfect, but it is also a large part of why other directories have went away. It is basically a directory tied to an encyclopedia which is free and easy to syndicate. Every large search & discovery platform has an incentive for Wikipedia to be as expansive as possible. The bigger Wikipedia gets, the more potential answers and features can be sourced from it. More knowledge graph, more instant answers, more organic result displacement, more time on site, more ad clicks. Even if a knowledge graph listing is wrong, the harm done by it doesn't harm the search service syndicating the content unless people create a big deal of the error. But if that happens then people will give feedback on how to fix the error & that is a PR lead into the narrative of how quickly search is improving and evolving. "Wikipedia used to instruct its authors to check if content could be dis-intermediated by a simple rewrite, as part of the criteria for whether an article should be added to wikipedia. There are many rascals on the Internets; none deserving of respect." - John Andrews Sergy Brin donates to fund the expansion of Wikipedia. Wikipedia rewrites more webmaster content. Google has more knowledge graph grist and rich answers to further displace publishers. I recently saw the new gray desktop search results Google is tested. When those appear the knowledge graph appears inline with the regular search results & even on my huge monitor the organic result set is below the fold. The problem with that is if your brand name is the same brand name that is in the knowledge graph & you are not the dominant interpretation then you are below the fold on all devices for your core brand UNLESS you pay Google for every single click. How much should a brand like The Book of Life pay Google for being a roadblock? What sort of tax is appropriate & reasonable? How high will you bid in a casino where the house readjusts the shuffle & deal order in the middle of the hand? I recently did a search on Bing & inside their organic search results they linked to a Mahalo-like page called Bing Knows. I guess this is a feature in China, but it could certainly spread to other markets. If they partnered with an eBay or Amazon.com and put a "buy now" button in the search results they'd have just about completely closed the loop there. Broad Commodification The reason I started this article with directories is their role is to link to sites. They are categorized collections of links which have been heavily commodified & devalued to the point they are rendered unnecessary and viewed adversely by much of the SEO market (even the ones with decent editorial standards). Just like links got devalued, so did domain names. And, as mentioned above in the parts about blogging, content farms, web portals & news sites ... the same trend is happening to almost every type of content. Online ad revenues are still growing quickly, but they are not flowing through to old media & many former leading bloggers consider blogging dead. Big platform players like Google and Facebook broaden cross-device user tracking to create new relevancy signals and extract most the value created by publisher. The more information the platform owns the more of a starving artist the partners become. As partners become more desperate, they overvalue growth (just like Yahoo! with Polyvore): "It's the golden age right now," [Thrillist CEO Ben Lerer] said. "If you're a digital publisher, you have every big TV company calling you. When I look at media brands, if a media brand disappeared tomorrow, would I notice?" he said. "And there are a bunch of brands that have scale, and maybe a lot of money raised, and maybe this and that, but, actually, I might not know for a year. There's so many brands like that. Like, what does it really stand for? Why does it exist?" Disruption is not a strategy, but the whole point of accelerating it & pushing it (without an adequate plan for "what's next") is to re-establish feudal lords. The web is a virtual land where the commodity which matters most is attention. If you go back in time, lords maintained wealth & control through extracting rents. A few years ago a quote like the following one may have sounded bizarre or out of place These are the people who guard the company’s status as what ranking team head Amit Singhal often sees characterised as “the biggest kingmaker on this Earth.” But if you view it through the some historical context it isn't hard to understand "The nobles still had the power to write the law, and in a series of moves that took place in different countries at different times, they taxed the bazaar, broke up the guilds, outlawed local currencies, and bestowed monopoly charters on their favorite merchants. ... It was never really about efficiency anyway; industrialization was about restoring the power of those at the top by minimizing the value and price of human laborers." - Douglas Rushkoff Google funding LendUp & ranking their doorway pages while hitting the rest of the industry is Google bestowing "monopoly charters on their favorite merchants." Headwinds The issue is not that the value of anything drops to zero, but rather a combine set of factors shrinks down the size of the market which can be profitably served. Each of these factors eat at margins... lower CPMs the rise of ad blockers (funded largely by some big ad networks paying to allow their own ads through while blocking competing ad networks) rise of programmatic ads (which shift advertiser budget away from publisher to various forms of management) larger ad sizes: "Based on early testing, some advertisers have reported increases in clickthrough rates of up to 20% compared to current text ads. " increase of vertical search results in Google & more ads + self-hosted content in Facebook's feed shift of search audience to mobile devices which have no screen real estate for organic search results and lower cost per click (there's a reason Google AdSense is publishing tips on making more from mobile) increased algorithmic barrier to entry and longer delay times to rank The least sexy consultant pitch in the world: "Sure I can probably rank your website, but it will take a year or two, cost you at least $80,000 per year, and you will still be below the fold even if we get to #1 because the paid search ads fill up the first screen of results." That isn't going to be an appealing marketing message for a new small business with a limited budget. The Formula “The open web is pretty broken. ... Railroad, electricity, cable, telephone—all followed this similar pattern toward closedness and monopoly, and government regulated or not, it tends to happen because of the power of network effects and the economies of scale” - Ev Williams. The above article profiling Ev Williams also states: "An April report from the web-analytics company Parse.ly found that Google and Facebook, just two companies, send more than 80 percent of all traffic to news sites." The same general trend is happening to almost every form of content - video, news, social, etc.. a big platform over-promotes a vertical to speed up buy-in (perhaps even offering above market rates or other forms of compensation to get the flywheel started) other sources join the market without that compensation & then the compensation stream gets yanked displacement of the source by a watered down copy (eHow or Wikipedia styled rewrite), or some zero-cost licensing arrangement (Facebook Instant Articles, Google AMP, syndicating Wikipedia rewrites) strategic defunding of the content source promise of future gains causing desperate publishers to lean harder into Google or Facebook even as they squeeze more water out of the rock. Hey, sure your traffic is declining & your revenue is declining faster. You are getting squeezed out, but if you trust the primary players responsible for the shift & rely on Instant Articles or Google's AMP this time will be different. ...or maybe not... Facts & Opinions When I saw some Google shills syndicating Google's "you can't copyright facts" pitch without question I cringed, because I knew where that was immediately headed. A year later the trend was obvious. The Internet commoditized the distribution of facts. The "news" media responded by pivoting wholesale into opinions and entertainment.— Naval Ravikant (@naval) May 26, 2016 So now we get story pitches where the author tries to collect a few quote sources to match the narrative already in their head. Surely this has gone on for a long time, but it has rarely been so transparently obvious and cringeworthy as it is today. How modern journalism works pic.twitter.com/i2CRnwAWZy— Nick Cohen (@NickCohen4) June 15, 2016 And if you stray too far from facts into opinions & are successful, don't be surprised if you end up on the receiving end of proxy lawsuits: Can we talk about how strange it is for a group of Silicon Valley startup mentors to embrace secret proxy litigation as a business tactic? To suddenly get sanctimonious about what is published on the internet and called News? To shame another internet company for not following ‘the norms’ of a legacy industry? The hypocrisy is mind bending. The desperation is so bad news sites don't even attempt to hide it. And part of what is driving that is bot-driven content further eroding margins on legitimate publishing. Google not only ranks those advertorials, but they also promote some of the auto-generated articles which read like: As many as 1 analysts, the annual sales target for company name, Inc. (NYSE:ticker) stands at $45.13 and the median is $45.13 for the period closed 3. The bearish target on sales is $45.13 and the bullish estimate is $45.13, yielding a standard deviation of 1.276%. Not more than 1 investment entities have updated sales projections on upside over the last week while 1 have downgraded their previously provided sales targets. The estimates highlight a net change of 0% over the last 1 weeks period. Sales estimated amount is a foremost parameter in judging a firm’s performance. Nearly 1 analysts have revised sales number on the upside in last one month and 1 have lowered their targets. It demonstrates a net cumulative change of 0% in targets against sales forecasts which were given a month ago. In latest quarterly period, 1 have revised targeted sales on upside and 1 have decreased their projections. It demonstrates change of 4.898%. I changed a few words in each sentence of that quote to make it harder to find the source as I wasn't trying to out them specifically. But the auto-generated content was ranked by Google & monetized via inline Google AdSense ads promoting the best marijuana stocks to invest in and warning of a pending 80% stock market crash coming soon this year. Hey at least it isn't a TOTALLY fake story! Publishers get the message loud and clear. Tronc wants to ramp up on AI driven video content at scale: "There's all these really new, fun features we're going to be able to do with artificial intelligence and content to make videos faster," Ferro told interviewer Andrew Ross Sorkin. "Right now, we're doing a couple hundred videos a day; we think we should be doing 2,000 videos a day." All is well, news & information are just externalities to a search engine ad network. No big deal. "With newspapers dying, I worry about the future of the republic. We don’t know yet what’s going to replace them, but we do already know it’s going to be bad." - Charlie Munger Build a Brand Build a brand, that way you are protected from the rapacious tech platforms. Or so the thinking goes. But that leads back to the above image where The Book of Life is below the fold on their own branded search query because there is another interpretation Google feels is more dominant. The big problem with "brand as solution" is you not only have to pay to build a brand, but then you have to pay to protect it. And the number of search "innovations" to try to siphon off some late funnel branded traffic and move it back up the funnel to competitors (to force the brand to pay again for their own brand to try to displace the "innovations") will only continue growing. And at any point in time if Disney makes a movie using your brand name as the name of the movie, you are irrelevant and need of a rebrand overnight, unless you commit to paying Google for your brand forever. Having an offline location can be a point of strength and a point of differentiation. But it can also be a reason for Google to re-route user traffic through more Google owned & controlled pages. Further, most large US offline retailers are doing horrible. Almost all the offline growth is in stores selling dirt cheap unbranded imported stuff like Dollar General or Family Dollar & stores like Ross and TJ Maxx which sell branded item remainders at discount prices. And as Amazon gets more efficient by the day, other competitors with high cost structures & less efficient operations grow relatively less efficient over time. The Wall Street Journal recently published an article about a rift between Wal-Mart & Procter & Gamble: “They sell crappy private label, so you buy Swiffer with a crappy refill,” said one of the people familiar with the product changes. “And then you don’t buy again.” In trying to drive sales growth, P&G is resorting to some Yahoo!-like desperate measures, included meetings where "Some workers donned gladiator-like armor for the occasion." Riding on other platforms or partners carries the same sorts of risks as trusting Google or Facebook too much. Even owning a strong brand name and offline distribution does not guarantee success. Sears already spun out their real estate & they are looking to sell the Kenmore & Craftsman brands. The big difference between the web and offline platforms is the marginal cost of information is zero, so they can quickly & cheaply spread to adjacent markets in ways that physically constrained offline players can not & some of the big web platforms have far more data on people than governments do. It is worth noting one of the things that came out of the Snowden leaks is spooks were leveraging Google's DoubleClick cookies for tracking users. As desperate stores/platforms see slowing growth they squeeze for margins and seek to accelerate growth any way possible. Chasing growth ultimately leads to the promise of what differentiates them disappearing. I recently bought some "hand crafted" soaps on Etsy, which shipped from Shenzen. I am not sure how that impacts other artisinal soap sellers, but it makes me less likely to buy that sort of product from Etsy again. And for as much as I like shopping on Amazon, I was uninspired when a seller recently sent me this. Amazon might usually be great for buyers & great for affiliates, but hearing how they are quickly expanding their private label offerings wouldn't be welcome news for a merchant who is overly-reliant on them for sales in any of those categories. The above sort of activity is what is going on in the real world even among brands which are not under attack. The domestic economic landscape is getting quite ugly: America’s economy today is in some respects more concentrated than it was during the Gilded Age, whose excesses prompted the Progressive Era reforms the FTC exemplifies. In sector after sector, from semiconductors and cable providers to eyeglass manufacturers and hotels, a handful of companies dominate. These giants use their market power to hike prices for consumers and suppress wages for workers, worsening inequality. Consolidation also appears to be driving a dramatic decline in entrepreneurship, closing off opportunity and suppressing growth. Concentration of economic power, in turn, tends to concentrate political power, which incumbents use to sway policies in their favor, further entrenching their dominance. And the local abusive tech monopolies are now firmly promoting the TPP: "make it more difficult for TPP countries to block Internet sites" = countries should have less influence over the web than individual Facebook or Google engineers do. In a land of algorithmic false positives that cause personal meltdowns and organizational breakdowns there is nothing wrong at all with that! I kept waiting. For a year and a half, I waited. The revenues kept trickling down. It was this long terrible process, losing half overnight but then also roughly 3% a month for a year and a half after. It got to the point where we couldn’t pay our bills. That’s when I reached out again to Matt Cutts, “Things never got better.” He was like, “What, really? I’m sorry.” He looked into it and was like, “Oh yeah, it never reversed. It should have. You were accidentally put in the bad pile.” Luckily the world can depend on China to drive growth and it will save us. Or maybe there is a small problem with that line of thinking... Beijing’s intellectual property regulator has ordered Apple Inc. to stop sales of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus in the city, ruling that the design is too similar to a Chinese phone, in another setback for the company in a key overseas market. Can any experts chime in on this? Let's see... First, there is Wal-Mart selling off their Chinese e-commerce operation to the #2 Chinese ecommerce company & then there's this from the top Chinese ecommerce company: “The problem is the fake products today are of better quality and better price than the real names. They are exactly the same factories, exactly the same raw materials but they do not use the names.” - Alibaba's Jack Ma Published: June 20, 2016 by Aaron Wall in publishing & media Previous Reinventing SEO Next Brands Beat Generics New to the site?

Photo: Reuters Are the recent acquisitions of Monster Worldwide Inc. by Randstad Holding NV and of Jet.com by Wal-Mart the last roar of the old economy? The two deals coming within days of each other continue a trend of acquisitions by large old economy companies of start-ups from the digital world. Thus, last month Verizon Inc. bought Yahoo! Inc., a year after it acquired the former America Online for $4.4 billion. Last January, Capital One acquired San Francisco-based money management app, Level Money, and in January 2013, Avis Budget Group Inc. bought Zipcar which changed the car rental business with its hourly rentals plans. In December 2011, health insurance giant Aetna acquired mobile health startup, Healthagen, the developer of the popular health app iTriage. Much like Verizon and Aetna, the 56-year old Randstad Holding NV, a Dutch multinational, has been a global leader in its business. While Monster’s bread and butter and mainstay is its website, Randstad focuses on recruitment centres. It has some 4,500 branches. Wal-Mart is, of course, a global behemoth, the largest company in the world by sales. By contrast, the companies they have acquired are products of the digital age, whose promise often exceeded their performance. Both Monster and Jet.com had reached the end of the road. A day before the announcement of the acquisition, Monster reported a net loss in the second quarter of $124.2 million. One of the pioneers of the new economy, the company has seen its fortunes plummet over the years. Its stock peaked at more than $86 a share at the height of the Internet bubble in March 2000, valuing the company at almost $8.4 billion. From there to a valuation of $429 million, the price which Randstad paid, is the story of many digital start-ups that left it too late. These acquisitions mark the coming together of two intersecting currents. Start-ups who have lost their way and are either running out of cash or simply out of momentum and see no future are putting themselves up for adoption. And old economy giants petrified by the changes around them and fearful of being left behind in the new digital world are using their last weapons—their vast cash hoards—to buy them up, often to the bafflement of outsiders. Also Read: Randstad to buy job ads site Monster for $429 million Thus, even as Wal-Mart, whose online sales made up just 3% of total revenue in fiscal 2016, coughed up $3.3 billion to buy Jet.com, analysts seemed more concerned about the impact of anti-trust moves in Japan on Amazon’s operations, than the challenge to its business from the Wal Mart-Jet combine. Wal-Mart’s move also comes at a time when Amazon is pushing the boundaries of technology in retailing by developing artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted shopping. Jet’s acquisition still doesn’t get Wal-Mart anything resembling Amazon’s Alexa AI which is its equivalent of a digital shopping assistant. In fact, all the major computing platforms from Microsoft, Google and Apple have some form of voice-activated AI assistant with search capability. There is thus a touch of desperation in the Bentonville-based giant’s purchase of Jet.com. Its revenues are stagnating—down at -0.7% for its year ending March 2016, while operating income declined by 11% in the same period. By contrast, Amazon’s Q2 revenue was up 31% y-o-y while operating income was up 180% to $1.3 billion. Bit players like Jet.com have increasingly got left behind in the winner-takes-all world of digital services. Wall Street Journal reported that Procter & Gamble Co., the world’s biggest advertising spender, in a rejig of its digital advertising strategy, is scaling back spends on smaller websites that lack the reach of sites such as Facebook, Google and YouTube. That has meant a rash of new-economy start-ups available for a song. And large, old economy companies are past masters at beating down such acquisition targets. But whether buying a start-up when its descent down the cliff has already started, is such a great idea, no matter the cost, is open to debate.
