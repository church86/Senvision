Procter & Gamble (P&G) conmemoró el Día Mundial del Agua con el estreno del documental 'Desafiando el Futuro: la Transformación del Agua'. En este se busca crear conciencia sobre la importancia de que la niñez tenga acceso al agua potable. El video fue producido por National Geographic Latinoamérica y muestra los testimonios en primera persona de las familias latinoamericanas que han sido beneficiadas por el programa Agua Limpia para los Niños, iniciativa sin fines de lucro de P&G que, desde 2004, lleva agua limpia a las comunidades que no tienen acceso al agua potable para beber. Por otro lado, la compañía creó los sobres de Purificador de Agua P&G, cuyo propósito es funcionar como una pequeña planta de tratamiento de agua, que transforma el agua sucia y contaminada en una limpia para beber. Alianza. Walmart de México y Centroamérica y P&G se unen por tercera vez para llevar agua limpia a los costarricense. Del 20 de abril al 5 de julio del 2017 por cada producto P&G tal como Ariel, Pantene, H&S, Gillette, Pampers entre otros, comprado en las tiendas Walmart, MasXMenos, Palí y MaxiPalí, P&G donará el equivalente a un día de agua limpia, para seguir recaudando donaciones destinadas al fondo global de Agua Limpia para los Niños. "Beber agua potable es algo que muchos de nosotros ni nos damos cuenta que estamos haciendo en nuestro día a día, pero es un reto diario para muchas familias en todo el mundo", dijo Fernando Calderón, gerente de Comunicaciones P&G. "El agua limpia tiene el poder de transformar la vida de esas personas, proporcionándoles salud y una mejor calidad de vida. Por eso, trabajamos en forma continua para aumentar la sensibilización acerca de ese tema global tan significativo y el documental producido por National Geographic es una herramienta muy importante para lograr este objetivo”, añade Viviana Calderón, embajadora de P&G. El programa Agua Limpia para los Niños se implementa en Costa Rica desde julio del 2015 a través de una alianza público privada conformada por el Ministerio de Salud, el Instituto Costarricense de Acueductos y Alcantarillados (AyA), la empresa Procter and Gamble (P&G) y la Asociación Empresarial para el Desarrollo (AED). Ha beneficiado a más de 1000 familias. Comparta este artículo Somos Célebres P&G realiza documental junto a NatGeo Rellene los campos para enviar el contenido por correo electrónico.

The facility was built in partnership with Proctor & Gamble. The $200 million project included collaboration with local city, county and state leaders including the Albany-Dougherty Payroll Development Authority, as well as the Georgia Public Service Commission and Georgia Power, which will purchase power at or below avoided cost from Constellation. The facility will provide 100 percent of the steam and 60-70 percent of the total energy needed to run the adjacent P&G facility where they manufacture paper towels and toilet paper. The plant is expected to provide 30-35 full-time jobs over the next 20 years. Fifty percent of those jobs will go to local residents, while the other 50 percent are specialized and will be filled by current Exelon Energy employees. The plant is currently in the midst of its initial testing phase, expected to run until March 31.

How Dollar Shave Club's Founder Built a $1 Billion Company That Changed the Industry Michael Dubin is just getting started. Michael Dubin, the fresh face of men’s grooming. Image credit: David Yellen Jaclyn Trop Current Issue Subscribe now ---Shares March 28, 2017 This story appears in the April 2017 issue of Entrepreneur. Subscribe » Michael Dubin occasionally allowed himself to envision the moment when everything paid off. He’d be ushered into a grand ceremony, where some conglomerate, eager to own his massively successful company, would offer him a fortune for the pleasure. “I thought we would pass a really nice pen around in a wood-paneled boardroom with portraits of men with white hair,” he says. When the moment actually came, on July 19, 2016, there was none of that. He was in his pajamas, lying on a bed at the Skytop Lodge in the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania. His lawyers had been working through the night, and now the sun was up and Dubin had his cellphone pressed to his ear. In two hours, he was set to take the stage in the hotel’s ballroom, where leaders of the multinational conglomerate Unilever would gather for its biannual conference. There, they’d announce that he was now part of their team: Dollar Shave Club was being acquired for $1 billion. But first, the deal had to be finalized. Dubin listened as, one by one, the executives on the phone gave their approval. Then it came down to him. Related: Know When and How to Sell Your Business Today, Dubin swears he hadn’t been looking to sell the company so early. (He declines to say whether other offers had come along.) The way he saw it, his five-year-old Dollar Shave Club was only getting started. When he launched it in 2012, the razor market was dominated by Gillette, which claimed 72 percent of the U.S. market and had been purchased by Procter & Gamble for $57 billion in 2005. Schick was a distant second. But Dubin saw an opening. He could start by undercutting the big competitors on razors, and then build out something that felt less like a shaving supply company and more like a full-scale men’s club -- a subscription-based grooming brand with personality, that men actually identify with. “If anyone else had brought me the idea, I would have said, ‘Well, it’s a tough category with lots of global competitors,’” says venture capitalist Kirsten Green, founder of Silicon Valley-based Forerunner Ventures. But Dubin quickly convinced her to be one of his company’s early investors. Spend any time with Dubin and it’s easy to understand why. Tall, sandy-haired and preppy, the 38-year-old entrepreneur can vacillate between guy’s-guy sarcasm and serious, intense shop talk. He’s also a voracious reader, giving every new employee copies of two of his favorite books: Thich Nhat Hanh’s How to Sit and Peter Drucker’s The Effective Executive. “Within the first 10 minutes of meeting Michael, I was completely drawn into his idea and vision and him,” Green says. In the years that followed, Dollar Shave Club released a full range of products, made a name for itself with viral online videos and produced the kind of growth rarely seen in the once sleepy category of men’s grooming. Other mail-order companies, such as Harry’s and ShaveMOB, entered the space, and Amazon got into the game as well. By 2015, four years after Dubin began, web sales for men’s shaving gear had more than doubled industry-wide, to $263 million -- and the following year, Dollar Shave Club was the number one online razor company, with 51 percent of the market, compared with Gillette’s 21.2 percent, according to research firm Slice Intelligence. This clearly spooked the industry giant; Gillette launched its own Gillette Shave Club and bought promoted tweets to claim things like “two million guys and counting no longer buy from the other shave clubs.” But Dubin’s company kept growing, more than doubling its revenue every year since launching. It started with $6 million in 2012 and is on track for more than $250 million this year. Photo stills courtesy of Dollar Shave Club   Still, the sale to Unilever was a detour from his initial roadmap. He hadn’t built Dollar Shave Club for a quick cash-out. He thought his company could become “a brand that sits on the shelf next to the Starbucks and the Nikes and the Red Bulls of the world,” he says, and he wanted to be the one to lead it there. That meant Dollar Shave Club must retain what made it special -- its culture, its voice and its free spirit. But would his then-205 employees and three million-plus members, who were attracted to its lovable scrappiness, still feel that connection once the startup became part of a corporate giant? “I think it’s always a concern of a founder,” Dubin says. “The most important aspect of culture is how people feel about their role. You need clear financial and spiritual objectives and benefits. If you don’t get that right, it doesn’t matter how many beanbag chairs you have.” The company’s open floor plan in a Los Angeles suburb doesn’t have beanbag chairs at all, actually, but it does have a strong culture of communal fun and a tireless work ethic: free lunch on Tuesday, events like bouquet making on Valentine’s Day and Play­Station and Nintendo boxes beneath a neon sign in pink cursive that says get back to work. (“That’s a bit of our dry humor,” says spokeswoman Kristina Levsky.) Related: Learn the Traits of Successful CEOs Unilever, however, promised that the company he built would stay the same -- and he would have the financial freedom to truly achieve his vision. So in the hotel room, still in his pajamas, Dubin flipped open his laptop and brought up DocuSign. The $1 billion contract appeared in front of him. He clicked OK. Sale finalized. Then DocuSign’s standard message popped up: “You’re done signing. A copy of this document will be sent to your email address when completed by all signers. You can also download or print using the icons above.” “I took a screenshot,” Dubin says, “because it was so unceremonious.” A few hours later, as planned, Dubin went onstage to be introduced as Unilever’s newest leader. Then he and Unilever’s president of North American operations, Kees Kruythoff, flew to Los Angeles to tell Dollar Shave Club’s employees. As Dubin recalls, “He said, ‘Congratulations; you just bought Unilever,’ which was his way of saying it was important for us to maintain our culture.” Dubin had taken the company this far. Now everyone looked to him to keep it going. Dubin grew up in Bryn Mawr, Pa., not far from the Pocono Mountains, where he signed that deal of a lifetime. After graduating from Emory University, he moved to New York City, where he took several jobs in marketing and advertising, seeking work in the smaller, more nimble business units of companies including NBCUniversal and Time Inc. “I like molten environments that have yet to harden, because it allows you the opportunity to have a voice and to shape things, and I do think that I’m a good shaper of things,” he says. At night, he took classes in accounting, corporate finance and comedy improvisation, a combination that helped him see business as a fluid, ever-changing space. “One of the tenets of improv is to use what’s given to you and make the most out of it,” he says. “You can’t be overly precious about the way you had outlined things in your head at the beginning of a venture.” In 2011, Dubin met a friend’s father-in-law at a party. Over cocktails, the man told Dubin that he needed to unload a warehouse full of surplus razor blades. Dubin’s improv instincts kicked in; he offered to help. Dubin thought about his long-standing irritation with the razor-buying process -- go to the store, ask a salesclerk to open the plexiglass-encased “razor fortress” and pay more than seems reasonable for a small pack of blades. If he could mail blades to customers for a lower price, he reasoned, men would appreciate the problem he was solving. And from there, the opportunity only got bigger. “American men are evolving in their bathroom routine,” Dubin says. “Five years ago, if you spent time in front of the mirror, people would have called you a metrosexual. We now live in the age where it’s OK to hug guys and compliment and give advice.” But while some major brands had shifted to serving those guys -- Axe shook off its bro image, Old Spice rebooted its marketing and Dove launched a line of men’s products with a 2010 Super Bowl ad -- nobody had tried to build a community around affordable men’s grooming products. Dubin thought he could. He registered the domain dollarshaveclub.com within a week and began sketching out his notion for a grooming empire. A few months later, he quit his job to work on it full-time. And on March 6, 2012, at 6 a.m. Pacific time, he published a video that announced Dollar Shave Club to the world and would establish the voice it always spoke in. It opens on Dubin at a desk, pitching his razors. But then he stands up and walks with a swagger. “Are the blades any good?” he asks. “No.” Then he stops next to a sign that says our blades are f***ing great -- and from there, the video turns into a self-aware, shticky, hilariously slapstick pitch, with Dubin wielding a machete, driving a forklift and dancing with a guy in a bear costume while scattering dollar bills into the air with a leaf blower. It cost $4,500 to make, which came out of Dubin’s meager savings, and it proved an instant success. The company took 12,000 orders that day. The video has since been watched 24 million times on YouTube. “It spoke to a psychographic that wants to take life lightly,” says Olivier Toubia, a Columbia Business School professor who teaches the video as a case study. “Sometimes customers just want something simple.” This was an audience that the likes of Gillette had overlooked, with its self-serious, high-tech blades and vibrating handles. And Dubin, relying on the insights he’d learned by working in marketing, intentionally timed the release for maximum impact -- just before South By Southwest, when reporters were in a lull waiting for big digital news to break. He coupled the video’s launch with the announcement that his company had closed $1 million in seed funding, so, Dubin says, “the tech press picked it up first, and then the mainstream press picked it up from there. At that point it was viral.” Even at the start, when Dollar Shave Club was functionally a one-man operation selling surplus blades, Dubin wanted to pay off on the “club” part. What could he offer, aside from a mail-order product? He decided to designate himself the company’s first “Club Pro.” It was a spin on customer service; rather than just helping people with their orders, a Club Pro would be on hand to answer any grooming questions -- a kind of on-call concierge, available by email, phone, text, online chat or social media. If a man somewhere wondered why his skin was red on the days he didn’t shave, Dubin would find the answer. Once Dubin hired a few employees, he and a small team began traveling the country to learn more about people’s grooming habits. They focused on regional events like the Maine Lobster Festival and the Gilroy Garlic Festival -- places where grooming conversations weren’t exactly the norm. The point was to meet average guys on their turf and learn what they wanted. “We figured out how to talk to people, not at them,” says Cassie Jasso, one of the company’s first 10 hires. Dubin was eager to expand into other products, but the festivals taught him that he couldn’t just start stocking his digital shelves. Men were happy to talk about grooming, but they weren’t always knowledgeable or adventurous about it. To succeed, Dollar Shave Club would have to be more than a voice -- it would have to be the leader of a conversation, and an educator that men actually wanted to hear from. At 10 a.m. on a Tuesday morning this past January, Dubin is presiding over a glass-enclosed conference room in the modern, low-slung warehouse in Marina del Rey, Calif., that Dollar Shave Club has occupied since 2015. Eight members of the company’s creative team have convened for a brainstorming session; they want to script a video that explains their sulphate-free soap and hairstyling products. The company has expanded into more than 30 products across five categories, and promoted them with hundreds of funny videos for TV, YouTube and its own website. Dubin still stars in some, but other staffers get camera time as well. Today the group considers Fadi Mourad, the company’s gregarious, tattooed chief innovation officer, who is responsible for developing new products. Related: The Secret to Selling to Big Companies “What if we dressed Fadi as Clippy from Microsoft?” someone suggests, and then makes his voice squeaky to impersonate the software’s much-maligned paper clip mascot. “Hmm … looks like you’re buying shampoo!” They run through several more scenarios: Fadi as mad scientist, Fadi as zany Swedish chef. Someone proposes a cooking show format where Fadi shows how shave butter is made. “Bingo,” Dubin says. “I love that. I think that’s a really fun format to play with. I like the juxtaposition of the scientist with the average guy. That cuts to the heart of the brand and who we are.” That sense of brand -- and of what people expect from it -- has steered not just the company’s marketing but its product development as well. It took Mourad some time to adjust to it. He had spent 15 years developing products for Estée Lauder and Bumble and Bumble and was used to long meetings where trend forecasters would dissect runway shows and fashion magazines. “My first executive meeting here was eye-opening because nobody cared what those trends were,” says Mourad. Instead, the company often turned to regular guys to say what they needed, what they were excited to try, and what basics could be improved upon. “That’s never how I would have started the innovation process anywhere else.” Much like its foray into oddball festivals, Dollar Shave Club began this process with a lot of small consumer panels. “We talk through the ‘shit, shave and shower’ routine with our customers and uncover pain points,” Mourad says. Surprising ideas would come out of these, like when one panel began complaining about rough toilet paper. From this, the company created its popular One Wipe Charlies, a flushable, moist cloth it bills as the “#1 way to clean up after #2.” “No trend would have told you that guys are looking for butt wipes,” Mourad says. (Meanwhile, when beard oils and dry shampoos briefly became a thing, Dollar Shave Club passed; its panels just didn’t seem interested.) This saves Dollar Shave Club a lot of hassle. About 80 percent of the products it tries out eventually make it to market. Of course, this doesn’t mean the company always hits the bull’s-eye. Last year, it launched an exfoliating cloth marketed to men as a “shower tool,” but the reviews weren’t great. “We didn’t hide the reaction,” says chief marketing officer Adam Weber, who previously worked at Procter & Gamble and Gilt Groupe. “We had a very transparent conversation with our customers and redesigned it in less than two weeks.” Then they sent a refund to all 64,000 members who bought the old version, even if they hadn’t asked for one. “That was the moment we realized we needed a much bigger member panel,” Weber says. Its other panels had helped products develop, but Dollar Shave Club had no way of testing products once they actually existed. Last year, it created a 500-member, invite-only group of long-standing customers. They now test new products and give instant feedback, which Weber says has helped the company overall. “It creates a sense of urgency to react faster,” he says. For the three million-plus customers who aren’t in that little group, Dollar Shave Club is continually seeking ways to engage them with more than just sales pitches. It has hired writers and editors to create MEL, an online men’s lifestyle magazine; a funny pamphlet called “Bathroom Minutes,” which comes in every delivery; and the company’s podcast, which tackles topics such as “Why Is Everyone on the Internet So Angry?” and “Which Body Parts Can You Actually Grow Back?” And although Dubin long ago stopped having time to personally answer customers’ grooming questions, he’s replaced himself with more than 100 Club Pros, who now work out of the company’s headquarters. In fact, as the company continued to grow, Dubin was increasingly being drawn away from the club members he’d courted. “I went out and raised money every 12 months, which takes three months at the very least and becomes your number one, all-consuming priority,” Dubin says. It’s something every startup CEO has to deal with, of course. But then an unexpected conversation had him envisioning a very different routine. In 2015, when Dubin was interviewing investment banks to help raise Series D funding, he met J.P. Morgan managing director Romitha Mally. Shortly after, Mally ran into her friend Kees Kruythoff, president of Unilever’s North American operations, at the Virgin Atlantic lounge at Heathrow. “I told him about this amazing company we just raised money for, a 21st-century men’s grooming platform with sticky customers,” she says. Intrigued, Kruythoff asked to meet Dubin. The three of them had dinner at the Mandarin Oriental hotel in New York. “There was instant chemistry between the two of them,” Mally says. There was synergy between the companies, too. Both men saw the possibilities in combining the resources of a multinational conglomerate with a disruptive innovator. Dubin thought he could recruit Kruythoff to serve in an advisory role or on Dollar Shave Club’s board. Unilever had a bigger vision. Five months after that dinner, Unilever called Mally after seeing Dollar Shave Club’s Super Bowl commercial to say it wanted to buy the company. Unilever was especially interested in the company’s substantial trove of customer data and potential to scale globally. “Most consumer packaged-goods companies distribute through a retailer, so you never know who your best customers are,” Mally says. “But Michael found a powerful way to connect directly with the consumer.” The offer flattered Dubin. And the more he sat with it, the more he liked it. Unilever was offering to keep everything the same: Dubin and his company would stay in Marina del Rey, under his leadership. And with Unilever’s money, Dubin would be freed up to focus on growing the business at a rate he couldn’t have imagined before. “When we began the discussions with Unilever, I thought, Wow, what could I do with 25 percent more of my time? What amazing results we could have,” Dubin says. “We didn’t want to open this up to competitive bidding. At a certain point, it became too attractive to say no.” “Excuse me?” A guy with long hair and a beard bends over our table. “Are you the founder of Dollar Shave Club?” Dubin nods; this happens regularly, ever since his first viral video made him an internet star. “Love what you did with the razors,” the guy says, proffering a fist bump before walking away. We are at Superba Food + Bread, a casual breakfast spot in Dubin’s Venice, Calif., neighborhood that he visits most mornings before heading into the office. He knows the secret parking spots and usually has a black coffee waiting for him on the counter. As the man walks away, Dubin sizes up his grooming habits. “He looked like the kind of guy who uses an electric razor,” Dubin says. “He had great hair, so he must use our amazing hair products.” Dubin is feeling relaxed these days. He’s loving the life of a CEO who doesn’t fundraise or worry about running out of money. “The ability for me to focus more completely on operations and running the business has de-stressed me a bit,” he says. And he’s energized by planning Dollar Shave Club’s next big move: international expansion. The company already operates in Canada and Australia, and is now plotting its footprint in Europe and Asia. Related: You're a Real CEO When Your Company Is Bigger Than Your Title New cultures will create new challenges for Dollar Shave Club. After all, the company grew by keenly understanding the American man. Now it will have to dissect very different cultures, with very different grooming standards. But Dubin’s team treats this as liberating -- allowing it to follow new paths and enter new product categories, all while following the same instincts Dubin used to grow the company in the first place. “Michael can look into the future better than anyone I’ve ever met,” Weber, the CMO, says. “Some people call it luck, but I think Michael has a very good sense of when to do what. There’s no set template. You can’t go and buy the playbook.” So what’s next? The conversations inside Dollar Shave Club may shock the average dude. Hair color. Vitamins. Some are even talking about men’s color makeup, something Mourad, the innovation officer, truly believes American men will soon want. But if those guys take a while to come around, that’s fine: Dollar Shave Club can now hone those products in more fashion-forward countries. And one day, when guys here are ready for makeup, Dollar Shave Club will probably do what it does best: make a video that transforms a quiet category into something surprisingly special.

(GuruFocus) Related PG Kevin Kelly's Consumer Staples Trade Household Names JPMorgan Initiated Ratings On This Week According to CNBC's Jim Cramer, nearly every Wall Street analyst failed to talk about Snap Inc (NYSE: SNAP)'s one major advantage that no other social media platform has yet to copy: the ability for kids to communicate without their parents monitoring their activity. Cramer explained during CNBC's "Squawk on the Street" segment on Tuesday that the problem with Snap's whole appeal is two-fold. First, iconic household names such as Procter & Gamble Co (NYSE: PG) may not want their brands associated with some of the content that kids are secretly sharing among each other. Second, whatever advantage Snap holds in the social media landscape can be copied by Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB)'s CEO Mark Zuckerberg. In fact, Cramer said the Facebook co-founder is the "most competitive CEO" to lead a company since Larry Ellison. Facebook Launches 'Snap Two' Cramer further suggested that Facebook's new feature announcement on Tuesday is essentially "Snap Two." Masks, frames and interactive filters have long been a hallmark of Snapchat, but that is no longer the case and Snap's 4 percent decline on Tuesday, despite some support from Wall Street analysts earlier in the day, is showing how investors really feel about Zuckerberg's ambitions to take away all of Snap's advantages. "I'm telling you this guy [Zuckerberg] does not like anybody encroaching on his turf," Cramer emphasized.

from the world's unstructured and unconnected data to enable optimal commercial decisions News provided by Signals Analytics Mar 28, 2017, 10:39 ET Share this article NEW YORK, March 28, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Signals Analytics, the Sequoia Capital-backed decision science company that enables companies to continuously experience the "aha moment" through Signals Intelligence Streams, a cloud-based machine learning and predictive analytics platform for product decisions, continues its global expansion with the establishment of its New York City headquarters. The organization brings the proven military principles of Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) to the consumer goods and life sciences industries, enabling brands to maximize product portfolio health, accelerate new product development and propel breakthrough innovation. Signals Analytics serves over 60 of the world's foremost companies, including Johnson & Johnson, Procter & Gamble and Pepsico, with European operations in Geneva and Signals Labs in Tel Aviv. Co-founded by CEO Gil Sadeh and Chief Research Officer Kobi Gershoni, Signals Analytics is built on the vision of applying the principles of military intelligence to product portfolio management and corporate innovation. "Using our training, we set out to develop a cloud-based platform that detects signals from the noise and provides a unified system-of-record for product decisions, one that empowers executives to respond to conditions of uncertainty and anticipate a constantly changing marketplace," states Gil Sadeh, "Historically, the military has been decades ahead of business in leveraging unconventional approaches that support real-time decision making and result in optimal outcomes. 90% of all data is unstructured and unconnected, and our offerings present a unique opportunity to transform corporate intelligence right up to the boardroom." While leading organizations have invested millions of dollars to support data-driven cultures, some 80% of the world's top 500 brands still experienced a decline in market share during 2016.  Conventional big data solutions are having little effect in stemming these losses: $115 million is the average cost of launching a new product; 80% of new products remain on the shelf for less than 12 months and 96 percent of all innovations ultimately fail to return their cost of capital. "Corporate insight must evolve to confront market realities: customer experience is omnichannel, digital is now the center of gravity and mobile is the new front door," states Kobi Gershoni, "The detection, modeling and analysis of data generated via social footprint, digital body language and web properties is now exceeding the utility of internal data sets and is providing life to legacy brands, ensuring new product success and uncovering previously hidden growth horizons." Focusing on core market segments across the life sciences, consumer good and retail industries, Signals Intelligence Streams are comprised of Signals Hive, a cognitive computing, foundation that transforms and interprets disparate data sets, as well as situationally reveals actionable insights, and Signals Playbook, the central hub for preconfigured guided decision models that includes an early warning system for instant notification of real-time marketplace developments and disruptions. The platform is backed by Signals Labs, a team of data wranglers, scientists and modelers that provides continuous monitoring and central control to assure quality and tune performance.  Shmil Levy, Partner of Sequoia Capital and Board Member of Signals Analytics explains, "We chose to partner with Signals Analytics because we strongly believe in the potential of this new way of approaching open source intelligence and capitalizing on the data economy. Signals Analytics brings a proven track record of transformational impact with marquee clients and presents an overwhelming growth opportunity." Doug Leone, Global Managing Partner of Sequoia Capital continues, "Signals Analytics' unique approach is helping big global brands uncover fundamental truths about their customers, competition and cultures, and take the actions needed to build and launch more innovative products."   About Signals Analytics Signals Analytics (www.signals-analytics.com) is a decision science company that enables global brands to continuously experience the "aha moment" through Signals Intelligence Streams™, a cloud-based machine-learning and predictive analytics platform that transforms diverse, unstructured and unconnected data sources into actionable insights that maximize product portfolio health, accelerate new product development and propel breakthrough innovation.

The organization brings the proven military principles of Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) to the consumer goods and life sciences industries, enabling brands to maximize product portfolio health, accelerate new product development and propel breakthrough innovation. Signals Analytics serves over 60 of the world's foremost companies, including Johnson & Johnson, Procter & Gamble and Pepsico, with European operations in Geneva and Signals Labs in Tel Aviv. Co-founded by CEO Gil Sadeh and Chief Research Officer Kobi Gershoni, Signals Analytics is built on the vision of applying the principles of military intelligence to product portfolio management and corporate innovation. "Using our training, we set out to develop a cloud-based platform that detects signals from the noise and provides a unified system-of-record for product decisions, one that empowers executives to respond to conditions of uncertainty and anticipate a constantly changing marketplace," states Gil Sadeh, "Historically, the military has been decades ahead of business in leveraging unconventional approaches that support real-time decision making and result in optimal outcomes. 90% of all data is unstructured and unconnected, and our offerings present a unique opportunity to transform corporate intelligence right up to the boardroom." While leading organizations have invested millions of dollars to support data-driven cultures, some 80% of the world's top 500 brands still experienced a decline in market share during 2016.  Conventional big data solutions are having little effect in stemming these losses: $115 million is the average cost of launching a new product; 80% of new products remain on the shelf for less than 12 months and 96 percent of all innovations ultimately fail to return their cost of capital. "Corporate insight must evolve to confront market realities: customer experience is omnichannel, digital is now the center of gravity and mobile is the new front door," states Kobi Gershoni, "The detection, modeling and analysis of data generated via social footprint, digital body language and web properties is now exceeding the utility of internal data sets and is providing life to legacy brands, ensuring new product success and uncovering previously hidden growth horizons." Focusing on core market segments across the life sciences, consumer good and retail industries, Signals Intelligence Streams are comprised of Signals Hive, a cognitive computing, foundation that transforms and interprets disparate data sets, as well as situationally reveals actionable insights, and Signals Playbook, the central hub for preconfigured guided decision models that includes an early warning system for instant notification of real-time marketplace developments and disruptions. The platform is backed by Signals Labs, a team of data wranglers, scientists and modelers that provides continuous monitoring and central control to assure quality and tune performance.  Shmil Levy, Partner of Sequoia Capital and Board Member of Signals Analytics explains, "We chose to partner with Signals Analytics because we strongly believe in the potential of this new way of approaching open source intelligence and capitalizing on the data economy. Signals Analytics brings a proven track record of transformational impact with marquee clients and presents an overwhelming growth opportunity." Doug Leone, Global Managing Partner of Sequoia Capital continues, "Signals Analytics' unique approach is helping big global brands uncover fundamental truths about their customers, competition and cultures, and take the actions needed to build and launch more innovative products."   About Signals Analytics Signals Analytics (www.signals-analytics.com) is a decision science company that enables global brands to continuously experience the "aha moment" through Signals Intelligence Streams™, a cloud-based machine-learning and predictive analytics platform that transforms diverse, unstructured and unconnected data sources into actionable insights that maximize product portfolio health, accelerate new product development and propel breakthrough innovation. Leading companies, including Procter & Gamble, Nestle, Johnson & Johnson, Bayer, General Motors and 3M, have partnered with Signals Analytics to anticipate and react to change, optimize commercial decision making and drive superior business outcomes quicker and with less risk. Backed by Sequoia Capital, Qumra Capital and TPY Capital, Signals Analytics has been dubbed "The App Store for Innovation" by Forbes, awarded Cool Vendor of 2016 by Gartner and honored the past two years as a Deloitte Fast 50 Technology Company.

All Resources By Peter Moore · March 28, 2017 There’s a federal bid opportunity that every medium to large ($15 million) third-party logistics provider (3PL) should read and consider responding to. This $2 billion dollar, long-term contract is to provide extensive supply chain management services to the U.S. Department of State (DOS) Bureau of Diplomatic Security (DS), including supplying U.S. embassies, consulates and other domestic and overseas locations with security-related equipment and supplies. Reference the Government’s Federal Business Opportunities portal , Solicitation No. SAQMMA17R0168 for additional information. And as your reading through the request for proposal (RFP), keep in mind that, for shippers and 3PLs, this is a “heads up” on changes coming to logistics contracting. DOS is seeking a new approach to a single source contract that, at its core, is doing what 3PLs do best: providing customized, reliable services through multiple modes of transportation. However, in addition to these operations, DOS is adding such functions as an engineering front-end and the management of items requiring return or replacement. The solicitation states: “The sites that are supported by the SCM program vary from over 350 domestic and overseas locations housing U.S. embassies, consulates and missions, to other domestic U.S. government-operated facilities.” This is an opportunity for 3PLs with a global reach to use their resources to aid the DOS. And what a great project to work on—supporting the security needs of our embassies and consulates across the world, keeping U.S. personnel, facilities and information secure. But best of all, this is coming up immediately. There is an industry day on April 3, with draft and a final RFP to follow. The targeted contract award date will be the first quarter of 2018. Keep in mind that this is significant because the DOS has committed to embarking toward a collaborative relationship with a key commercial supply chain management partner after many years of using the transactional model followed by government and civilian shippers for many years. “There are numerous examples now in federal and state agencies in the United States and Canada as well as several EU countries moving to collaborative contracting such as ‘vested’,” says Dr. Karl Manrodt Ph.D., a professor at Georgia College and co-author of four vested outsourcing books. “This is great news for 3PLs that have been fighting the commoditization of their services and are now being recognized and rewarded for bringing real value for their clients.” Most changes in contracting take leadership from large pioneering organizations, and these leaders can then create interest in markets for many types of service contracts. On the commercial side there are published cases (see vestedway.com) such as Microsoft, Dell, Proctor & Gamble and others that are adopting collaborative contract methods.   “When I see very large logistics buyers such as DOS adopt such an innovative approach to 3PL service contracts, I’m excited for the future for shippers and providers as they both gain from utilizing new pricing and service models.” — Peter Moore On the government side, the Department of State is joining the U.S. Air Force, the State of Tennessee, two Canadian provinces and others in focusing on innovation as the path to improving service and cost metrics. Shipper buyers and 3PL sellers are adopting business models that include incentives for both sides to originate and support greater creativity and productivity increases. This trend toward collaborative contracting is something that smart shipper and buyers are finding out about to their benefit. In this shift, shippers will notice that they’re focusing more on service outcomes and spending less time telling providers how to do their job by describing processes, technologies and even particular people that must be used to get the job done. When I see very large logistics buyers such as DOS adopt such an innovative approach to 3PL service contracts, I’m excited for the future for shippers and providers as they both gain from utilizing new pricing and service models.

So, we are planning to set up a new factory in North India, either in NCR Delhi or in Uttar Pradesh this year,” he said. He said the company would invest ₹25 crore in the new manufacturing unit. Nobel Hygiene already operates a factory in Nashik in Maharashtra where it has put up six manufacturing lines with fully-automated machines. The unit manufactures adult and baby diapers, underpads and baby diaper pants. Mr. Johari said that the company was also planning to set up a manufacturing base outside India. However, he did not disclose the location. “We may start very soon,” Mr. Johari said. Globally, the disposable hygiene market is estimated at $50 billion and this includes diapers and sanitary napkins according to industry officials. In India, this market is estimated at ₹6,000 crore. The Indian market is dominated by three MNCs: Procter & Gamble, Kimberly-Clark and Unicharm of Japan, that manufacture and sell their brands Pampers, Huggies and MamyPoko respectively. Nobel Hygiene has two brands: Friends for adult diapers and Teddyy for baby diapers. Mr. Johari said his company had been growing at 30-40% for the last seven years as compared with the average industry growth of 20-25%. “We are the only company in India which manufactures all types of diapers and underpads. Besides, we have designed diapers as per the Indian body structure and thus our diapers do not leak,” he said. The adult diapers market is estimated at ₹350 crore at MRP level while the baby segment is worth more than ₹5,500 crore. “The penetration level of diapers in India is 6% as against 35% in China. This leaves vast scope for growth,” Mr. Johari said. He said the company is targeting to manufacture 20 lakh pieces of diapers per day by 2019 as compared to 10 to 12 lakh pieces currently. The company exports to Middle East, Africa, Central Europe and USA. Private equity investors CLSA and Access Investment have invested in the company. The adult diapers market is growing by 18 to 25% in the cities while in the rural areas the growth in the range of 2 to 10%. The awareness on adult diapers is growing and families are now willing to spend ₹6000 on diapers per month due to enhanced comforts they provide to the elderly and the sick. The diapers have given the elderly the freedom to move around and the respect they deserve at a stage when they lose all control to promptly respond to nature’s call.

Catalyst Multimedia Today's Paper Topics ePaper WealthCheck SEARCH Follow Home News Markets Companies Money & Banking Economy Info-tech Opinion Specials Portfolio BLink Stocks Forex Commodities Gold & Silver Today's Pick Portfolio Tracker IiAS seeks greater clarity on basis for royalty payouts Our Bureau comments   ·   print   ·   T+  ·   T- Tweet Though legitimate, ‘value must be evidenced in sales growth or higher pricing power’ Mumbai, March 28:   Royalty payments by multinational companies in India outpace their local subsidiaries’ performance, according to a new analysis by the proxy advisor Institutional Investor Advisory Services (IiAS). In FY16, aggregate royalty payments of 32 MNCs in the BSE 500 aggregated ₹7,100 crore, up from ₹6,300 crore in FY15. The trend of increasing royalty payouts without commensurate improvement in revenues and profits continues, according to IiAS. In FY16, the paid out royalty aggregated approximately 21 per cent of the MNCs’ pre-royalty pre-tax profits, reporting a 13.2 per cent five-year CAGR. In contrast, pre-royalty pre-tax profits have grown at a CAGR of 9.6 per cent and net sales have grown by 8.7 per cent. IiAS said companies must provide greater clarity regarding the basis on which royalty is paid out, given that it has outpaced both sales and profits in the past five years.Dip in post-royalty margins Royalty is a legitimate payment, but its value must be evidenced in sales growth or higher pricing power (and therefore higher margins). Revenue growth for MNCs has been higher than that of S&P BSE 200 companies over the past five years and at margins that are comparable as well. However, royalty payouts are high, resulting in average post-royalty margins being lower by over 7 per cent in recent times as compared to pre-royalty pre-tax margins. According to the analysis, Gillette India, Procter & Gamble and Cummins India rank the highest because they have never paid royalties to parent companies that are higher than the dividends paid to domestic shareholders. At the other end of the spectrum are BASF India, Schneider Electric and United Spirits who have annually paid more in royalties and haven’t grown as well in income, profits or dividends.Appropriate level Royalty payment is a compensation for brand and technical knowhow given to the subsidiary. However, such payments need to be pegged at an appropriate level, IiAS said. While the brands that these MNCs bring carry value — faster revenues at comparable margins to other S&P BSE 200 companies — the question remains on what is the appropriate level of royalty. An over 7 per cent lowering of margins driven by royalty alone is significant, and deprives investors of the EPS upside, of investing in a stronger business or brand proposition, the report concluded.

For 2017, we are already reiterating with a great deal of confidence our target of revenue growth of 10% combined with consistently solid margins. Given our key strengths, we can now aspire to becoming a world-class player in long-term care. That said, our focus will resolutely remain on providing high-quality care and creating value. Full-year 2016 results: growth, profitability and solid finances In m (IFRS)   FY 2016   FY 2015   % change Revenues   2,841.2   2,391.6   +18.8% EBITDAR (Recurring EBITDA before rents) 769.3 652.4 +17.9% Recurring EBITDA 474.5 400.5 +18.5% Recurring operating profit 348.1 303.6 +14.7% Net financial result 2 -111.6 -96.8 +15.2% Pre-tax profit on ordinary activities 2 236.5 206.7 +14.4% Attributable net profit excluding the discounting of deferred taxes2   177.6   153.3   +15.8% Attributable net profit 2   257.6   153.3   N/A Another year of strong profitable growth 2016 revenues posted a strong increase of 18.8% to 2,841.2m. Organic growth3 ahead of our target (6.0%, excluding the positive effect of the leap year) and the contribution made by international acquisitions, including in Germany, Poland and Spain, were the main drivers. EBITDAR (recurring EBITDA before rent) advanced by 17.9% to 769.3m and accounted for 27.1% of revenues  a clear improvement on its level of 26.7% in the first half of 2016. The EBITDAR margin excluding the principal acquisitions4 consolidated for the first time in 2016 came to 27.6%, up 30 basis points (bp) compared with 2015. Rental expenses came to 294.8m, compared with 252.0m in 2015. This increase was primarily attributable to the first-time consolidation of certain companies acquired during the period (Celenus, Vitalis and Residenz Gruppe in Germany), which lease almost all of their facilities. At comparable structure, rental costs recorded a very modest increase of 0.6%. Recurring EBITDA rose 18.5% to 474.5m, accounting for 16.7% of revenues, stable compared with 2015. The EBITDA margin excluding acquisitions4 was 17.6%. This strong improvement of 90bp on 2015 demonstrated the effectiveness of ORPEAs real estate strategy of securing ownership of a larger proportion of its facilities. The cost of debt2 rose 15.2% to 111.6m against the backdrop of major real estate investments and acquisitions of businesses over the past 12 months. This tight grip on interest expenses was achieved through a 60bp reduction in the average cost of debt compared with 2015. Non-recurring items totalled 22.9m, compared with 19.5m in 2015. After 85.6m in income tax expense5 (up 12.2%), attributable net profit5 for 2016 came to 177.6m, excluding the positive impact of discounting deferred taxes at the last known rate. This represented a strong increase of 15.8%. Taking into account the positive impact of 80m from discounting deferred taxes at the last known rate of 28.92% in France, 2016 attributable net profit5 totalled 257.6m. Dividend payment of 1.0 per share proposed At the Annual General Meeting on 22 June 2017, the Board of Directors will propose paying out a dividend of 1.0 per share in respect of the 2016 financial year, compared with 0.90 in respect of the previous financial year. A high-quality real-estate portfolio worth 4.1bn In keeping with its strategic goal of lifting its real-estate ownership rate, ORPEA increased the size of its portfolio in 2016 by 644m (net of 140m in asset sales), a rise of 18.7%. At 31 December 2016, its portfolio was worth a total of 4,089m6, representing a developed area of 1,525,000m² and an ownership rate of 39%, compared with 36% at 31 December 2015. Its valuation by independent appraisers showed an average capitalisation rate of 6.1%, compared with 6.3% at year-end 2015. This real estate strategy gives ORPEA a unique position in the sector. It will secure its cash flow over the long term and give it additional flexibility to go ahead with extensions and restructuring projects without driving up its real estate costs. Flexible financial structure At 31 December 2016, ORPEAs net financial debt totalled 3,680m7, of which 84% was real-estate debt (compared with 78% at 31 December 2015). ORPEAs debt ratios at 31 December 2016 were well below the maximum levels permitted by its bank covenants and reflect its tremendous financial flexibility: lower financial leverage restated for real estate assets = 2.3x (authorised level of 5.5x); adjusted gearing = 1.5x (authorised level of 2.0x). Thanks to the optimised hedging of its floating-rate debt and additional financing raised at an attractive cost, the average cost of debt has continued to decline, falling to 3.2% in 2016, down from 3.8% in 2015. The debt is now entirely fixed-rate, and its cost will continue to decline gradually to 2.9% by 2022, irrespective of the direction of interest rates. ORPEA still boasts a substantial debt capacity and can borrow on favourable terms from both banks and credit investors owing to the highly predictable nature of its business activities and the strength of its finances, which is built on its real-estate portfolio. Network of 77,094 beds in 10 countries Further strong network expansion in 2016: 9,313 additional beds During 2016, ORPEA continued to expand its network selectively. It grew by 9,313 additional beds, representing an increase of 14.4% as a result of: strategic acquisitions with 6,491 beds added by deals for Medi-System in Poland, Vitalis in Germany and Sanyres in Spain; selective developments through the creation of new facilities, extensions and acquisitions, accounting for 2,822 additional beds, mostly in attractive locations such as Prague, Vienna and Barcelona. European network with strong growth potential ORPEAs network now comprises 77,094 beds at 751 facilities in 10 countries. The number of beds outside France (43,972) now accounts for 57% of the overall network, twice the figure of two years ago. Following the opening of around 2,500 beds in 2016, ORPEAs growth pipeline remains solid, with 9,115 beds being restructured or under construction, 75% of these outside France.     Total number of sites   Total number of beds   Beds in operation   Including beds under redevelopment   Beds under construction France   357   33 122   31 743   1 030   1 379 Germany   165   16 824   14 518   -   2 306 Austria   59   4 995   4 776   -   219 Belgium   60   7 389   5 651   239   1 738 China   1   140   140   -   - Spain   45   7 857   7 697   -   160 Italy   16   1 738   1 331   60   407 Poland   10   1 174   704   -   470 Czech Rep.   6   784   210   -   574 Switzerland   32   3 071   2 538   -   533 TOTAL   751   77 094   69 308   1 329   7 786 In China, the pilot Nanjing facility, which opened its doors in 2016, provides a unique showcase for ORPEAs know-how in a country experiencing tremendous demand. ORPEA, the first foreign group to open a high-end facility in China for elderly people requiring long-term care, has gained an excellent reputation, attracting interest from major Chinese public- and private-sector investors. To expand further, while keeping its risks under control, the Group is also planning to enter into management agreements and joint ventures with well-known local investors. Unwavering ethical commitment to continuous improvement Every year, the ORPEA Groups International Ethical and Scientific Board holds the ORPEA Excellence Awards. The event aims to promote a professional and pragmatic culture of clinical ethics and to encourage teams from all its countries to innovate and make constant improvements to the care they provide to residents and patients. This year, 24 projects led by Group subsidiaries in 8 countries made the cut. The projects include: Cine-Ethics, which consists in organising an evening film screening for patients and their friends and family followed by a debate, to start a dialogue between professionals and service users a research programme into chronic pain and post-traumatic stress ORPEA also supports academic research projects. These include the Pain-free residence programme in Austria as part of cooperation between the Paracelse faculty of medicine in Salzburg and Senecura facilities. This initiative led to improved detection of pain in elderly residents, and 300 nurses received algology training. This integrated programme of improvements is paying off: It has earned recognition from industry professionals, with ORPEA receiving prizes at the Trophées Silver Eco and Trophées de la Fédération de lHospitalisation Privée awards It is appreciated by residents and their families: the end-of-year satisfaction survey of residents and families revealed a recommendation rate of over 91.6% in each country (France, Belgium, Italy, Spain, Germany, Switzerland and Austria). Strategy and outlook for 2017 In 2017 and beyond, ORPEA intends to continue pursuing its strategy of international expansion by: building new facilities to a high standard of quality in prime locations in every country in which it has a presence; making selective acquisitions to complement its existing network, while strictly observing the Groups profitability criteria; steadily raising its real-estate ownership rate by retaining and/or acquiring assets in the most attractive locations; expanding to new geographical territories where there is substantial demand for long-term care, and especially to regions with strong purchasing power; developing the complementary nature of ORPEAs offering with homecare and services, independent living facilities and outpatient treatment to broaden the spectrum of care it provides. For 2017, ORPEA is confidently reiterating its revenue target of 3,125m, a 10% increase on 2016, without factoring in the impact of any new developments, with the operating margin remaining consistently firm. Dr Jean-Claude Marian is retiring as Chairman, and Philippe Charrier has been appointed Non-Executive Chairman. Dr Jean-Claude Marian has been named Honorary Chairman Now 78 years old, Dr Marian has decided to focus on his private life after spending 28 years building up the ORPEA group and making it a leading provider of integrated long-term care in Europe. Dr Marian said: "For several years, I have naturally been thinking about passing on the reins. In 2011, the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer were split, with the appointment of Yves Le Masne as Chief Executive Officer, responsible for the operational management and for the development of ORPEA. Over the past three years, I have taken tremendous satisfaction from ORPEAs spectacular transformation. It has gone from being a French company with several European subsidiaries to a truly multinational group. Together with their teams, Yves Le Masne and Jean-Claude Brdenk have been the driving force behind the powerful expansion momentum in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Poland and Czech Republic, and have striven to build a strong strategic and managerial organisation to oversee these developments. It became clear that we needed to look for a suitable Non-Executive Chairman. We have chosen to appoint Philippe Charrier, whose entrepreneurial drive, knowledge of the healthcare sector and personal values will enable him to support and continue the roll-out of ORPEAs business model. Dr Jean-Claude Marian has retired from his duties as a director and the Board of Directors, after consulting with Executive Management, has co-opted Philippe Charrier, who has been named as Non-Executive Chairman of ORPEA. Dr Marian has been appointed Honorary Chairman. To display its full confidence in the senior management team, the Board of Directors has also decided to renew Yves Le Masnes term in office as Chief Executive Officer and Jean-Claude Brdenks term as Chief Operating Officer. Philippe Charrier, 62, is a graduate of the HEC business school and began his career with Procter & Gamble where he later became Chairman and CEO for France in 1999. Since then his career has been more entrepreneurial, and he took the helm at two French companies  Oenobiol (food supplements) and Labco (European leader in clinical diagnostics)  that he successfully built into multinationals operating in a number of countries including Spain, Germany and Italy. He is also a director of MédiPôle Partenaires until the merger with Elsan, which has given him solid experience of the healthcare sector. He is currently Executive Chairman of Ponroy Santé (natural health products). Philippe Charrier has also been active in the charity sector. He has been involved in projects to combat the social exclusion of vulnerable individuals with neurologic and psychiatric conditions through social and employment integration projects. Yves Le Masne, Chief Executive Officer, and Jean-Claude Brdenk, Chief Operating Officer, added: "On behalf of all our teams, we wish to express our sincere gratitude and extend our best wishes to Dr Marian, who has worked for close to 30 years to build a European leader in long-term care. Dr Marian has helped to change practices in our industry, and in particular to raise the standard of care. This longstanding central concern has guided his actions on a daily basis. We have all learned a great deal from him. He has passed on his passion, his experience and his ground-breaking vision to us. We have always shared his strategic decisions, such as, for example, in 1990, to secure a high level of real-estate ownership and, from 2004, to export the model outside France. This decision was anticipated, and plans were in place for it a long time ago, and we are very confident that we will able to maintain ORPEAs growth momentum with a view to making a world leader. Next press release: Q1 2017 revenues 2 May 2017 after the market close About ORPEA (www.orpea-corp.com) Founded in 1989, ORPEA is a European leader in integrated Long-Term Care and Post-Acute Care, with a network of 751 healthcare facilities, with 77,094 beds (9,115 of them under refurbishment or construction), including: 33,122 beds in France at 357 facilities (2,409 beds under refurbishment or construction); 43,972 beds in the rest of Europe (Germany, Austria, Belgium, China, Spain, Italy, Czech Republic, Poland and Switzerland) at 394 facilities (6,706 beds under refurbishment or construction).

The lightweight packaging is made entirely of post-consumer materials such as milk and orange juice containers, and morning coffee lids. The box is produced from a single process Polypropylene with no added chemicals. The modular design allows it to be used as a stackable, interlocking component of a product display or storage system, Nike says. “These are all intentional features and qualities which revolve around the intent of every Miniwiz product — reducing the impact on the environment in every way it can,” Huang said in a statement. “In this case, we’re adding features and efficiency to an existing product (shoe boxes) and by re-using non-virgin materials in a sustainable and responsible way.” The package can also be used as a backpack and is recyclable. Nike begin using the shoe box for its  NikeLab Air Max 1 Royal in China this month and will launch the product and its sustainable packaging globally next month. Nike’s announcement comes as several leading companies are employing circular economy approaches to creating new packaging from various waste streams. In January Procter & Gamble, in partnership with recycling and environmental management companies TerraCycle and Suez, developed the world’s first recyclable shampoo bottle made from up to 25 percent recycled beach plastic. Late last month Dell developed the technology industry’s first packaging trays made with 25 percent recycled ocean plastic content. Sustainable packaging can help companies save money on material and transportation costs, while also reducing their environmental impacts. Plus, it is becoming increasingly popular among consumers. For these reasons the global demand for recyclable, bio-based and other sustainable packaging types will reach about $440.3 billion by 2025, growing at a compound annual growth rate of around 7.7 percent, according to a Research and Markets report.

News sign-up Agencies can't forget creative intuition News, 29 March 2017 Topics Theories & ideas of communications NEW DELHI: Data will only take a campaign so far as agency creatives must use their 'creative intuition' to truly connect with consumers, a senior agency executive believes. "Data opens the mind, intuition unlocks the soul," said Josy Paul, Chief Creative Officer and Chairman of BBDO India, talking at the recent ad:tech event in New Delhi. "(Data is) important and we believe in it. However my view is that data is a power point, and intuition is a powerful point. It takes balls to balance data and intuition," he said. (For more, read WARC's exclusive report: Turning data into magic: The power of creative intuition in India.) Paul cited the agency's Share The Load campaign for laundry detergent brand Ariel, which won the 2016 WARC Prize for Asian Strategy, as an example where creative intuition overtook data to create work which directly challenged Indian societal norms. "We had three scripts for the brand (Ariel) that were approved, everything was going perfectly well. And it had taken us two months to get to that stage," Paul said. But at the last minute, the creative team was struck by fresh inspiration. "We thought about our own lives, we thought about how we could incite change. We thought about things that we had not spoken about before because suddenly a new rush of emotion took over," he added, revealing that the team created a new script in just a few hours. "No data could have helped us make that decision… It had to be conviction based on our own personal lives." Paul saluted the client, Procter & Gamble, for its willingness to support the last minute idea. "It takes guts on the part of the brave guys at P&G to say 'yes, let's go with that'. Especially when you have spent two months doing fantastic work, and then one day changing it all," Paul said.

Sapna Agarwal Photo: Indranil Bhoumik/Mint I am not a big fan of shopping at D-Mart. Don’t get me wrong—it’s not that I dislike it. I like to buy my fresh fruits and vegetables at the farmers’ market on Sunday at a park close to where I live in Juhu. They also sell staples, organic honey, preserves and cookies. I enjoy the interaction with the farmers, the experience and discovery. To me retail is not just about value for money, functionality and utility, it’s also about theatre, experience and discovery. Unlike me, millions of consumers in western India love shopping at D-Mart. The fact that the no-frills discount retail chain’s parent Avenue Supermarts Ltd listed on 21 March with a 115% premium to its sale price is testimony to that. To be sure, it’s not without reason that investors drove up the stock so steeply. The regional chain is India’s most profitable retailer. Over 90% of D-Mart’s customers are regular shoppers who buy from the retailer 2-3 times a month on average. This is despite having no loyalty programme. What seems to be working for D-Mart is offering limited merchandise at prices lower than its rivals. If Future Retail’s large format stores like Big Bazaar stock 30,0000-50,000 units on average, a D-Mart store stocks just 40-50% of that merchandise. Most of this seems to defy logic. After all, over the years, we have been getting used to increased choices. Today, there are around 141 models of passenger vehicles from 15 car manufacturers on Indian roads. This is without taking into consideration luxury car models such as BMW, Audi and Mercedes. In the early 1990s, there were just four passenger car manufacturers with about a dozen car models, which included Hindustan’s Ambassador and Contessa, Premier Padmini, Standard Herald and 2000, the Maruti 800, Omni and Gypsy, and a range of Mahindra utility vehicles. A search for soap on online retailer Amazon.com Inc.’s India website shows up 324,992 results whereas a search for shampoo produces 17,028 results. A huge change from 30-40 years ago when bath soaps were dominated by the red Lifebuoy, pink Lux, Liril and Cinthol soaps and hair wash options were largely Shikakai soap, Halo and Sunsilk shampoo. However, too much is not always a good thing. Especially given our stressful and busy urban lives, offering more options to consumers may just lead to confusion, making shopping an ordeal instead of a pleasure. Psychologists Sheena Iyengar and Mark Lepper said that consumers who are offered fewer choices are more likely to purchase, based on an experiment that they conducted with jam at an upscale food market in a landmark study in 2000. The psychologists put up a display of 24 varieties of gourmet jam on one table one evening and on another day, shoppers saw a similar table, except that only six varieties of the jam were on display. The large display attracted more interest than the small one. But when the time came to purchase, people who saw the large display were one-tenth as likely to buy as people who saw the small display. In his provocative book, The Paradox of Choice, Barry Schwartz warns that giving consumers more product choices actually lowers their purchase satisfaction. Schwartz reasons that having too many options makes us fear missing out, which causes anxiety, analysis paralysis and regret. Globally, some of the biggest success stories in food retailing in recent years are not that of US retailer Wal-Mart Stores Inc. or UK retailer Tesco Plc. They are of the international expansion of German no-frills retail chains Aldi and Lidl, founded in 1946 and 1973, respectively. Aldi and Lidl only offer between 2,000 and 3,000 lines. In comparison an average Walmart store has 100,000 products and an average retailer 45,000 items. It’s not only in retail. Look at some of the most successful brands—Tesla Inc., Apple Inc. and Google’s home page. What stands out is the simplicity of design, a clean interface, and no clutter. Among large retailers and manufacturers, the shift towards simplicity and offering less choice has already started happening. In 2015, Tesco announced cutting its range on its retail shelves by a third. Walmart reduced its average number of store displays by 15%. Even Procter and Gamble reduced its range of Head and Shoulders shampoos by nearly half—and ended up seeing a 10% bump in sales. Interestingly, for India, the journey from having no choices to having a plethora of choices, and now to preferring our choices curated for us has happened in a very short time frame of 25-26 years. It was only in 1991 that India opened its doors to multinationals and we saw our markets being flooded by foreign manufacturers like The Coca-Cola Co. and PepsiCo Inc. The lessons, though, are crystal clear. D-Mart, even though much smaller in size, on listing, had a market capitalization of Rs39,916.44 crore, more than the aggregate of all of its key listed national rivals including Future Retail Ltd, Shoppers Stop Ltd and Trent Ltd. Shop Talk will take a weekly look at consumer trends, behaviour and insights.

Arriving at O'hare airport on Airforce One Tuesday, early evening was First Lady Michelle Obama, daughter Malia and Vice President Joe Biden along with wife, Jill Biden. Making a final journey as the 44th President of the United States, expressways and local South Side streets were cleared as traffic stood at a complete when the 20-vehicle caravan made its way to Valois Restaurant in Hyde Park. There, President Obama conducted a one-on-one interview with NBC anchorman, Lester Holt before proceeding to give his farewell speech at McCormick Place. Nearly 20,000 attendees packed the nearly standing-room only space in the East wing of the McCormick Place as VIP attendees sat upfront to hang onto the President's every word. There were various groups that traveled from far and near to be a part of history including celebrity sightings from Sharon Stone to Empire's Jussie Smollett--local and state dignitaries. Opening up the ceremony was a special performance by Hip hop/R&B singer, BJ the Chicago Kid showcasing belting out the national anthem is a smart blue suit. Once President Obama hit the stage, the electric energy of emotions ran throughout the audience. At times, the crowd's applause was so loud that it impossible to hear him but there were moments that silence rippled throughout the venue--knowing this would be his last time addressing his hometown as Chief of Staff. In his signature style of class, poise and honor--he addressed the various strides that he and his administration has made over the last eight years in protecting America's democracy. His emotions got the best of him when he addressed his wife, First Lady Michelle Obama and daughter Malia who sat in the front row along with Vice President Joe Biden, wife Jill and his mother-in-law--Marian Shields Robinson. <blockquote> <p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Malia and Sasha, under the strangest of circumstances, you have become two amazing young women, smart and beautiful, but more importantly, kind and thoughtful and full of passion.  You wore the burden of years in the spotlight so easily.  Of all that I’ve done in my life, I’m most proud to be your dad.”</span></p> </blockquote> <p class="p1">After the speech, the Obama family took time out to walk along the barricades, greeting and shaking hands with supporters and friends. The scene was definitely historic and we knew it was the end of an era of class that will not be duplicated in the White House for a very long time.</p> <p class="p1"><a href="http://www.twitter.com/globalmixx">Follow Mary L.

Saved under Breaking News, International, Legal, National, NY State, NYC, Politics Tags: 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics, All Out, AtoS, Brad Hoylman, Coca Cola, Comptroller John Liu, Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli, Daniel Dromm, Daniel O’Donnell, Dow Chemical, General Electric, McDonald’s, Omega, Panasonic, Proctor & Gamble, Queer Nation, Russia, Russian anti-gay law, Samsung, Visa Share This Post Tweet New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli. | ANDREW HILL/ NYS COMPTROLLER’S OFFICE BY ANDY HUMM | Ten major Olympic sponsors from Coke to Dow Chemical –– none of which has acceded to calls that they speak out forcefully against Russia’s laws making it a crime to be gay in public –– are now being pressured by the $161 billion New York State Common Retirement Fund, led by Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli, to do that and more. New York City Comptroller John Liu and 19 private investment firms also signed the December 3 letter, which has yet to yield a response from the sponsors of the Olympics scheduled for February in Sochi, Russia. “The Russian government’s discriminatory laws have cast a shadow over the Olympics,” DiNapoli said in a December 5 release calling on the sponsors to “stand up for the respect and equality enshrined in the Olympic movement, advocate for human rights, and confront abuses.” DiNapoli joined by City Comptroller Liu, 19 investment firms DiNapoli, a Democrat, called it “not just the right thing to do, it protects shareholder interests and corporate reputations.” Liu, also a Democrat, said, “If they fail to step up and speak out in support of equal rights for all, they risk damaging their reputations and their value to investors.” Shelly Alpern, a director at Clean Yield Management, a signatory to the letter, said that since the Olympic Games derive 92% of their revenue from sponsorship and TV rights, they have enormous “influence over the International Olympic Committee and host countries. There is simply no justification for silence and inaction.” The letter called on the sponsors to take three steps –– make sure that their own “nondiscrimination policies are strong, inclusive, and enforced globally,” especially for employees in Russia; tell Russia’s leaders to rescind the anti-gay laws; and tell the International Olympic Committee (IOC) “to obtain firm and express commitments from the Russian government” on the safety and rights of athletes and visitors at the Sochi Games. The letter noted the recent protests against the inaction of the sponsors and the activist calls for boycotts of their products and services, emphasizing that taking the actions requested “will help protect your company’s brand and reputation, and, consequently, your profits and our investments.” New York City Comptroller John Liu. | NYC COMPTROLLER’S OFFICE The letter says, “Russia has drawn worldwide condemnation by its enactment of laws restricting the rights of LGBT citizens to free speech and assembly. These actions have cast a shadow over the competition and violate both the spirit of the Olympic Games and the Olympic Charter.” It also says, “We believe strongly that the corporations in which we invest have the opportunity to and should confront the wrongs that result from Russia’s new laws.” The laws have whipped up an extremely anti-gay atmosphere in Russia that has led to the torture and deaths of Russians perceived to be LGBT, an intensified crackdown on any public protest by LGBT people or anyone else, and terrorist attacks on gay bars and the offices of LGBT groups. Russia has taken action to stop adoptions of Russian children in countries that permit same-sex marriage and is considering a bill to take away children from Russian gay and lesbian parents outright. The recently concluded LGBT film festival in St. Petersburg was interrupted five times by bomb threats, and after its closing day out gay director Gus Van Sant and screenwriter Dustin Lance Black, in defiance of the new laws, unveiled a big rainbow banner outside reading “Support Russian Gays.” The banner was made by Rainbow Flag creator Gilbert Baker and brought into Russia by Black. DiNapoli has faced calls in recent months to divest from Russia by Upper West Side Assemblyman Daniel O’Donnell, West Side State Senator Brad Hoylman, and Jackson Heights City Councilman Daniel Dromm. The three out gay Democrats praised the move by the state and city comptrollers and either dropped or weakened their calls for divestment. “It’s a really great step,” said O’Donnell. “If others in DiNapoli’s position do the same thing, that might make the sponsors start to see their sponsorship as a bad thing, not a good thing.” DiNapoli’s move is believed to be the first such action from a state comptroller. There is a bill in the California Legislature calling for divestment from Russia, but it has not moved. Hoylman called it a “strong message” and said sponsors “must take action against Russia’s discriminatory laws targeting the LGBT community.” He termed their doing anything less “an abdication of their corporate social responsibility.” Saying, “The comptroller’s action and divestment are not mutually exclusive,” Hoylman indicated he is continuing to discuss the issue with DiNapoli’s office. Queer Nation NY, which has been out in the streets protesting the Russian laws for months now, issued a statement calling the comptrollers’ action “a small step,” adding that “if DiNapoli believes ‘strongly that the corporations in which we invest have the opportunity to and should confront the wrongs that result from Russia’s new laws’ then he should follow his own advice and immediately sell all the Russian assets held by the Common Retirement Fund. Unfortunately, DiNapoli has refused to even disclose the Russian assets held by the fund in response to a Freedom of Information request from Queer Nation.” In response to Queer Nation, Eric Sumberg, a DiNapoli spokesman wrote in an email, “Corporate engagement is the first step in any shareholder action. Comptroller DiNapoli is the trustee of the Fund and must ensure that the interests of the members, beneficiaries, and retirees of the retirement system are paramount in any investment decision.” Demonstrators from Queer Nation and allied groups protesting Russian President Vladimir Putin supporters who appeared at the Metropolitan Opera’s gala opening in September. | SAM SPOKONY Andre Banks, executive director of All Out, which has focused a lot of its efforts against the Russian laws on the Olympic sponsors, called the letter “a really bold and extremely important move. It sends a clear message that tacit support for Russian anti-gay laws is bad for business.” Banks said, “ We are running a campaign targeting Coca Cola and other sponsors that is going to ramp up at the beginning of the year and through the Games at Sochi. The comptroller’s action shows increased scrutiny and public criticism is a real liability” for these sponsors. He said the response from Coke so far has been “weak.” “They are talking to the IOC about these issues, but refuse to make an affirmative statement against the anti-gay laws,” Banks said. The major sponsors in addition to Coke and Dow are AtoS, General Electric, Omega, McDonald’s, Panasonic, Proctor & Gamble, Samsung, and Visa. DiNapoli’s release said that their failure to speak up against the Russian laws was “not acceptable.” Bloomberg News reported that Coca-Cola “won’t withdraw sponsorship to avoid undermining gay athletes who’ve spent years preparing for the competition. ‘A more positive impact can be made through continued involvement, rather than by sitting on the sidelines,’ Anne Moore, a spokeswoman for Coca-Cola, said by email.” Bloomberg also reported that Omega issued a statement saying it would be “inappropriate for us to take any position that could have even the appearance of partisanship.” Among the investors signing the DiNapoli letter were the Sisters of St. Francis of Philadelphia, the Unitarian Universalist Association, the Oneida Tribe of Indians of Wisconsin, Northstar Asset Management, Trillium Asset Management Corporation, and the Nathan Cummings Foundation. 11 Responses to NYS Comptroller to Olympic Sponsors: Condemn Russian Anti-Gay Laws William Stribling December 5, 2013 at 2:07 am This is very encouraging. I appreciate that our comptrollers are taking on this issue – we are hearing mostly stone silence from so many quarters. The safety and freedom of the Russian GLTB community is all our responsibilitie. This evil should , need not, be left in place. Shame on all these corporations and NBC who are showing their real colors. Time for our GLBT community to boycott NBC and MSNBC in response.
