Over 50 women owned business entrepreneurs (WBEs) located in Ibadan, Oyo State, took part in the training, which was held at the P&G Ibadan Plant Site recently. The programme was designed to improve the entrepreneurial potential of the women and also expand the supplier development programmes beyond the walls of P&G to women entrepreneurs through connections and trainings. Speaking on the training sessions, P&G’s Ibadan Plant Manager, Peter Orji and one of the programme facilitators, elaborated on the importance of empowering women. He explained that P&G is renowned for women empowerment and as an extension, the organisation decided to partner with WeConnect in order to empower women entrepreneurs. According to him, “P&G is committed to advancing and supporting the growth of Nigerian small, medium scale enterprises owned by women and improve their management and operational skills. Women need to be up skilled alongside their male contemporaries in thriving economic climes in order to actively contribute to the growth of the nation at large.” The women entrepreneurs were trained on modules such as: Entrepreneurship and Strategy Development, Human Resource Development, Assessing Finance and Visibility for Personal & Corporate Branding using Digital Media & Tools. Insights were also given on P&Gs procurement processes which intimated the participants on the company’s sourcing principles and how to do business with P&G. One of the participants at the training and a certified WeConnect member, Chief Creative Director of My World of Bags, Femi Olayebi appreciated P&G and WeConnect for prioritising women and creating diverse opportunities to empower them. She stated that “many organisations do not give women enough support but partnerships like these have equipped me to positively contribute to the family and to the nation at large.” According to a report by McKinsey’s in 2016, if women were allowed to equally participate in the economy, they could add as much as $28 trillion or 26 percent to the annual global GDP in 2025. P&G is one of the global advocates of women empowerment. Currently there is a global campaign led by the organisation tagged ‘We See Equal’ which is a celebration of women and gender equality. This initiative will empower millions of women and create global pride in women breaking the glass ceiling and help shape the societal perception of women in business and in general.

It was V V S Laxman’s consistent winning streak against Australia that earned him the title of ‘Very Very Special Laxman’. His score of 281 against Australia in the Test match at Eden Gardens in 2001, is considered as one of the greatest Test innings. Laxman was in the city on Wednesday joining hands with P&G Shiksha’s ‘Shiksha Superheroes’ movement, to educate and impact the lives of underprivileged children and support and build schools in Karnataka. He donned the avatar of a ‘Shiksha Superhero’ for the students of a P&G Shiksha school in the city. In a chat with Surupasree Sarmmah, Laxman talks about his life after cricket and more. How has life changed after cricket? I have really enjoyed my life as a cricketer since that was my passion. After retirement, I realised that my other passions included providing education to the underprivileged and quality cricket coaching to budding cricketers in Hyderabad. So it’s great that I am being able to pursue them and also spend time with my family. It’s been quite relaxing. What keeps you busy these days? I am working as a mentor for Sunrisers Hyderabad and as a batting consultant for the Cricket Association of Bengal. I run my own cricket academy in Hyderabad and have started a foundation that’s looking after underprivileged kids and their education. Your most memorable match... The Test match against Australia in 2001 in Kolkata is one of my most memorable matches. The situation we were in and how we bounced back and won the match and the series was quite a thrilling experience. A cricketer who is most entertaining in the dressing room... We have a lot of characters off-field like Harbhajan Singh, Zaheer Khan, Ashish Nehra, Yuvraj Singh and Virender Sehwag who lighten the atmosphere in the dressing room. We not only enjoyed playing on the field but also had a lot of fun off it. A young cricketer you admire... I have always been a big fan of Virat Kohli. I admire the way he has transformed himself in all aspects in the last three years. Virat is a role model as he keeps improving his game. If a biopic is made on you, which actor would you want in it? I am not sure (laughs). Many filmmakers have approached me from the Telugu and Hindi film industries for a biopic, but I was not very keen. I have actually never thought about it. Did you watch ‘Sachin: A Billion Dreams’? Yes, it is a brilliant movie and I got really emotional watching it. There were flashbacks of the good and the tough times we had together. He is an inspiration and the movie is just motivating many others to shine in life. Your thoughts on the present Indian team... It is fantastic. The way the team has handled the transition and made India the number one Test cricket-playing nation in the world is amazing. They have done really well in T20 and in the one-day format as well. I also believe that the Virat Kohli led team is formidable and I call them the ‘modern invincibles’. 2012 was your last year in international cricket. How would you sum up your career? The morning after I announced my retirement, I woke up feeling satisfied and content which is what matters.

Laxman expressed his delight at witnessing a difference being brought to the lives of underprivileged children through the endeavour. Laxman said he felt nostalgic reminiscing about his school days while interacting with the P&G Shiksha School students. Now in its 13th year, P&G Shiksha continues to make critical infrastructure and learning interventions by building and supporting schools across the country thereby providing underprivileged children with access to education. P&G Shiksha started 'Shiksha Superheroes', a campaign to acknowledge consumers, the real-life superheroes who make a simple brand choice of buying P&G products and contribute to this noble cause impacting the lives of thousands of underprivileged children. "This is the first time I have associated with P&G Shiksha and I am delighted to witness the difference that this movement has made by building and supporting more than one thousand schools that will impact the lives of more than one million children across India. I feel strongly for this cause as Education has played a vital role in shaping my professional and personal life," the right-handed batsman said. "Today, with the P&G Shiksha School students here, I was nostalgic reminiscing my school days. It felt amazing to interact with these young kids who have a bright future ahead of them. "My role is that I am a Shiksha Superhero and have been making a difference over the years by choosing P&G products like Old Spice, Head & Shoulders, Gillette, Vicks, etc. and hence I am contributing towards the education of underprivileged children," he added. When asked about how one can contribute to the cause, the 42-year-old cricketer explained: "I realised today that it is very easy to be a Shiksha Superhero in real life and make a contribution. All you have to do is choose P&G products and become part of the P&G Shiksha movement that will enable you to contribute towards the education of underprivileged children. "Like me, I want to encourage the people of India to be 'Shiksha Superheroes' by making this simple choice. It is a simple act and a very small contribution from our end but has a large impact on the lives of these children," he said. Tags: CSR P&G Shiksha former India batsman V.V.S.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: 5 Things You Didn't Know About Kimberly-Clark Corporation Here are a few key facts investors should know about this consumer goods giant. Demitrios Kalogeropoulos (TMFSigma) May 31, 2017 at 5:01PM It's one of the biggest consumer goods companies on the market, with dozens of global brands including Huggies diapers, Kleenex tissues, and Cottonelle toilet paper. But while you may be familiar with most of Kimberly-Clark's (NYSE:KMB) hit franchises, read on for a few key operating and financial facts you might not know about this business. Long sales slump Kimberly-Clark's annual revenue has slipped in each of the last two fiscal years after peaking at just under $20 billion in 2014. The decline is entirely thanks to foreign exchange rate shifts, though. Last year's 2% gain, for example, was the result of a slight uptick in organic growth that was swamped by a 4% hit from currency moves.  Image source: Kimberly-Clark. Stripping out the effects of exchange-rate moves still leaves a business facing major industry challenges. Kimberly-Clark's organic growth slowed to a 2% pace in 2016 from 5% in the prior year. The company expects 2017 to mark a second straight year of deceleration, too. Heavy reliance on rich markets Kimberly-Clark generates just over half of its sales -- and 70% of profits -- from the U.S. market. Peer Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), whose blockbuster Pampers brand battles against Kimberly-Clark's Huggies franchise, counts just 44% of its business from the U.S. The heavy reliance on this market has extracted a price on the business over the last few years. Since that industry segment has slowed to near zero growth, Kimberly-Clark has seen its organic growth pace fall as peers rebound or hold steady. P&G is on track to speed up its expansion pace to between 2% and 3% this year, from 1% in 2016, and Unilever is growing at a hefty 4% pace. Improving profitability The company generated a record high $2.2 billion of profit last year despite the sinking sales base. Cost cuts played a key role in this happy result as Kimberly-Clark sliced $435 million from its expense infrastructure. The trend continued into 2017, with $110 million of costs removed in the first quarter. In fact, operating margin has climbed to over 18% of sales, and executives believe they can reach 20% in the next few years, which would put Kimberly-Clark in the same company as industry leaders Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) and Clorox (NYSE: CLX). KMB Operating Margin (TTM) data by YCharts. Falling prices Kimberly-Clark aims to generate growth that's driven by increasing sales volumes but also includes a healthy dose of rising prices. Yet prices fell by more than a full percentage point in the most recent quarter. The decline was due to spiking competition in the U.S. market, management explained, where organic sales dove by 3%. Executives said its market segments worsened to a 0.5% growth pace from 1.5% last year. That decline is the main reason the company believes it will slightly underperform last year's 2% organic growth in 2017. Rich dividend history The company has boosted its dividend in each of the last 44 years, with the most recent annual raises weighing in at 5.4% this year and 4.5% in 2016. That puts the company ahead of P&G, whose latest two dividend increases were 3% and 1%. P&G has a longer track record of raises, though, boasting 60 straight annual hikes. Thanks to rising profitability and the declining negative impact of foreign currency moves, Kimberly-Clark remains on track to boost adjusted earnings by between 3% and 5% to mark a slight slowdown from the prior year's 5% boost. Improved growth in 2018 and beyond will depend on the health of the industry and on whether the company's latest innovations in its core tissue and diaper brands are a hit with consumers.

The site quickly became a haven for young girls to communicate, play games, get inspired, and more; and by 2008 it attracted the massive corporation, Procter & Gamble, which invested in and valued Miss O and Friends at $15 million. Three years later, Juliette’s teenage passion project had a steady user stream of 3 million monthly visitors. As Miss O and Friends continued full-steam ahead, Juliette did as well, even earning her college degree while running her thriving enterprise. And now, at 28, she’s taking yet another monumental step in her career: Juliette is executive producing a television series, Hyperlinked, based on her own story (including a namesake character specifically based on her). The 10-episode series, launching today on YouTube Red and was written and directed by an all-female team, will follow a fictional group of girls creating their own girls’ websites and navigating the all-too-common issues that face young teens coming of age. Teen Vogue caught up with Juliette to talk her website, TV show, and how she’s overcome the struggles of being a female entrepreneur. TV: Why did you start the website Miss O and Friends? JB: Miss O and Friends was first inspired by drawings I did when I was 10. We were driving back from vacation and I was bored, so I started doodling these girls I called “cool girls.” I gave them to my mom who’s a designer and she turned them into these characters: one for me and one for my little sister, Olivia. For years we’d just play with them. Then for Olivia’s 8th birthday, my mom made “Miss O-like” characters for her friends. When her friends saw these girls blown up big and mounted on thick foam core, they went CRAZY for them! They kept saying how cool they were and how they wished they had stuff with these characters. It was also at this birthday party where I started seeing things going on with Olivia and her friends that my friends and I, who were 13 and in middle school, were dealing with too. Things like: girls forming cliques or not wanting to eat birthday cake because they didn’t want to gain weight. They were only 8! It was really shocking… and seeing this, I wanted to do something to help Olivia and her friends through the next years of their lives and make it a little easier for them to navigate. A lot of girls think they are alone in whatever it is they are going through, but they aren’t. I wanted to create a community of girls that helped one another, where girls could get advice and be inspired, while having fun at the same time by playing games and winning prizes. Olivia’s nickname is “Miss O” and I started the site for her and friends, hence, the name Miss O and Friends! TV: Did you ever anticipate it would grow to be so big? JB: I always dreamed it would! TV: Procter & Gamble invested in your site when you were still a teenager. What do you think drew them to it? What do you think made (and makes) the site so successful? JB: They saw the authenticity in the site and how we were successfully able to tap into a very hard-to-reach demographic. Miss O and Friends wasn’t a company that was created by adults, for girls. It was actually created by girls, for girls and because of that, the site has always been able to stay relevant. It’s our community of girls that drives everything you see on the site, and I think that’s the biggest reason why we’ve been a success. TV: Did you learn coding after founding the site? If so, what was that experience like? JB: I’ve learned a lot of coding since we launched the site. It does take a lot of practice and patience, but it really is cool when you see the finished product. My mom and I have been learning together over the years, and when we both figure out how to do something new, we call each other and are so excited and proud! TV: You also went to college while running Miss O and Friends. What did you study, and what was that experience like? JB: I went to Washington University in St. Louis and studied Anthropology and Public Health. I loved college, and had an incredible four years in St. Louis. At the beginning of every semester, I’d write an email to my professors and let them know about Miss O and Friends and how sometimes there might be times I needed to miss class, or take an exam early. I found the more proactive I was about flagging any potential conflicts, the more understanding they were…because you know how the universe works…everything always happens at the same time! TV: How did the idea for Hyperlinked come about? JB: Our mission at Miss O and Friends has always been to empower and inspire young girls, and create media for girls that helps to build self-esteem. We had been doing this for years with the website, and wanted to grow that, which is why we wanted to create a show. My mom and I were constantly trying to think of ideas for what a series would look like, and one day we were like, “DUH! It should be about the story of how Miss O and Friends started.” The two of us and Larry Reitzer (the third creator of Hyperlinked) worked for months to develop the series and our characters, molding it into a show we are all very proud of and think kids and families will enjoy. TV: What are you most excited about with this series? JB: I’m so excited for girls and families to get to know the strong, empowering, relatable characters we’ve created. I really think they are something to look up to and I think a lot of people will relate to the story lines and situations they deal with. TV: What message do you hope the series sends? JB: I hope anyone watching is inspired, motivated, and empowered to go out and create! Whether it’s a website, an app, a YouTube Channel, or the next big medical breakthrough, you shouldn’t be held back by norms or stereotypes. I want everyone to go out and find what they love and do it. TV: What are some of the biggest challenges you’ve faced as a young, female entrepreneur? JB: When you’re starting out as young, female entrepreneur there definitely will be challenges. I’m young, so people don’t think I know what I’m doing, or that I don’t have enough experience. There are a lot of things when it comes to running a business that I don’t know, but I am either learning or trying something new. And it’s those new things that can be great and different. As a woman, many times the stereotype that I’m probably emotional is used against me and I’m viewed as weak or less qualified. I think that being emotional is actually one of my greatest qualities, because it’s what makes me so passionate and in turn, leads to my successes. When it comes down to it, there will always be people who doubt you or don’t take you as seriously as someone who is older, or male, but look at it as an opportunity to push yourself harder. TV: What advice do you have for girls and women who want to pursue careers in STEM or entrepreneurship, including those who may be scared or hesitant to do so? JB: It’s important for girls and women to feel confident in their STEM skills and know that if it’s something that interests them, keep doing it! Being good at or interested in STEM doesn’t make you nerdy. It makes you smart. And being smart is ALWAYS a good thing. Starting your own company isn’t easy, but if it’s something you believe in and are passionate about, it’s truly worth the journey. Think about why you’re creating it, why it’s important, what niche does it fill, and what you need to make this dream a reality. Once you start figuring out the base, you can work to build your plan of what you need and how you’re going to do it.

Brazilian Federal Police launched a major operation in several Brazilian states with search and arrest warrants for directors of the country's main meat-producing companies, such as JBS and BRF. Thirty-three employees of the Ministry of Agriculture were removed from office for alleged involvement in a corruption scheme and receiving a bribe for allowing spoiled meat to circulate in Brazilian supermarkets. (Photo by Victor Moriyama/Getty Images) Marketing Batista brothers resign from top JBS S.A. posts New board chair announced. May 27, 2017 Compiled by Cheryl Day JBS S.A., the world’s largest meatpacker, announced Friday that Joesley Batista resigned as chairman and member of the board. The Board of Directors unanimously elected Tarek Farahat as Batista’s replacement. Company owners and brothers Joesley and Wesley Batista entered into a plea bargain deal that accused Brazil’s President Michel Temer of endorsing the bribing of a witness in the country’s largest meat scandal. The brothers’ testimony, released last week, unleashed a political crisis, alleging that they bribed hundreds of politicians, reports Reuters. Both brothers resigned from their senior posts effectively immediately. Tarek Farahat has worked for Procter & Gamble for 26 years, serving in a number of leadership positions in several regions around the globe, including the Middle East, Europe and Latin America. From 2006-12, he served as president of P&G Brazil. In 2012, he became president of P&G Latin America and an officer of the company’s executive board. Farahat has been a member of the Board of Directors of JBS since 2013 and has served as global president of Marketing and Innovation since 2015. In the same meeting, José Batista Sobrinho was unanimously elected vice chairman of the Board. The Board also ratified the creation of a Governance Committee, which will be led by Farahat and whose main objective will be to implement global best practices in corporate governance and compliance at JBS. “Governance is my utmost priority. We will work hard to restore trust with the market and protect the more than 235,000 families that are part of JBS. There is a significant amount of work to be done in order to regain the trust of our stakeholders,” states Farahat. “We remain focused on offering consumers the highest quality products and services while maintaining a close partnership with our suppliers and clients, and supporting our more than 235,000 team members worldwide,” adds Farahat. 0 comments Hide comments Comment * More information about text formats Text format CommentsPlain text Comments Allowed HTML tags: <em> <strong> <blockquote> <br> <p> Plain text No HTML tags allowed.

"We are writing to express our strong support for the United States remaining in the Paris Climate Agreement," it said. "President Trump, stay in Paris and negotiate a better deal that creates jobs," according to the commercial that is also available on YouTube. The advertisement was signed by the heads of 3M, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase, Proctor & Gamble, General Electric, Johnson & Johnson, The Dow Chemical Company, Tesla, Citigroup and The Disney Company. The Paris Agreement, which was spearheaded by former President Barack Obama and signed by 195 countries in April 2016, aims to fight climate change by reducing carbon emissions and limiting global temperature rise to below 2 degrees Celsius. During his election campaign, however, Trump called global warming "a hoax" and promised to scrap the agreement and return jobs to the coal industry that is often an easy target for environmentalists. "I will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!," Trump said via Twitter on Wednesday.

These medications, which are used to treat heartburn and acid reflux disease, work by reducing the amount of acid produced by the stomach. PPI kidney injury lawsuits began mounting after two studies linked the heartburn drugs to an increased risk of kidney disease. One lawsuit was recently filed on behalf of an Alabama woman. Parker Waichman LLP has spent decades representing clients in drug injury lawsuits. The firm continues to offer free legal consultations to individuals with questions about filing a PPI kidney damage lawsuit. According to court records, the lawsuit was filed in the Superior Court of the State of Delaware on Mar. 31, 2017. The complaint states that the plaintiff suffered from kidney injuries, allegedly due to using over-the-counter PPIs including Nexium, Prilosec and Prevacid. The suit names AstraZeneca, Procter & Gamble and Takeda Pharmaceuticals as defendants. The lawsuit alleges that the drug makers “actively concealed” the “true and significant risks” associated with using PPI medications. “Defendants concealed and continue to conceal their knowledge that PPIs can cause kidney injuries from Plaintiff, other consumers, and the medical community,” the complaint states. “Specifically, defendants have failed to adequately inform consumers and the prescribing medical community against the serious risks associated with PPIs and have completely failed to warn against the risk of CKD and ESRD.” In 2016, two studies found that use of PPIs were associated with an increased risk of chronic kidney disease. Litigation has mounted following the studies, with plaintiffs alleging that Nexium, Prilosec and Prevacid caused kidney injuries and that manufacturers failed to warn of the risks. There are roughly 100 PPI kidney injury lawsuits pending, Law360 reports. According to legal experts, that number is expected to rise; there could be as many as 5,000 lawsuits alleging that PPIs caused kidney disease. For example, the makers of Nexium and Prevacid were sued last June. The lawsuit was filed on behalf of a man in the New York Eastern District Court in Brooklyn. He began taking both Nexium and Prevacid in 2006 and developed acute kidney injury. The lawsuit alleges that taking these heartburn medications caused kidney injury and that drug makers failed to warn of the risks. According to the complaint, PPI side effects have resulted in the need for medical care and monitoring for the rest of his life. As with other PPI kidney disease claims, the plaintiff alleges that he would not have taken the drugs if he were fully informed of the risks. Another complaint was filed over Prevacid and its maker, Takeda Pharmaceuticals. The lawsuit was filed on behalf of a plaintiff who used Prevacid from May 2005 through May 2012. The plaintiff has developed renal disease, and alleges that Prevacid is to blame. He alleges that the PPI maker should have warned adequately about the risk of kidney injury associated with Prevacid. PPI Kidney Disease Background PPI makers have been facing mounting litigation following two studies linking the gastric acid suppressors to an increased risk of kidney disease. One study was published January 2016 in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine. Compared to participants who did not use the heartburn drugs, PPI users had a 20 to 50 percent increased risk of developing chronic kidney disease. The study also found that higher doses of PPI medications increased the risk of kidney injury. In patients taking PPIs once a day, the risk of kidney disease increased 15 percent compared to 46 percent for patients taking the medications twice daily. In April 2016, another study linked PPI use to an increased risk of kidney injury. Researchers found that use of medications such as Prilosec, Nexium and Prevacid was associated with a higher risk of developing chronic kidney disease. Investigators analyzed data from 170,000 new PPI users and 20,000 new users of H2 receptor blockers, another class of heartburn medication. The study, published in the American Society of Nephrology, identified a 28 percent increased risk of chronic kidney disease among PPI users. Although only a small handful of patients developed end-stage renal failure (ESRD), use of PPIs was associated with a 96 percent increased risk of ESRD. Both studies identify a correlation between PPI use and kidney disease. These findings do not say anything about causality; in other words, they do not prove that PPIs cause kidney damage. Additional research is needed to learn more about the relationship between PPIs and kidney injury. While the studies do not show causality, the findings underscore that PPIs should not be used unless they are truly necessary. PPIs have been the subject of other studies as well. The Journal of the American College of Cardiology published a study suggesting that taking PPIs and Rocephin (a type of antibiotic) may be associated with heart risks when taken together. Neither drug is associated with significant cardiovascular risks on their own. The study found that taking these drugs together may be associated with an increased risk of long QT syndrome, a condition that can cause heart rhythm irregularities and in rare cases, sudden death. Another study, conducted by researchers from the Australian National University recently found that use of PPIs may be associated with an increased risk of infectious gastroenteritis, also known as the stomach flu. Patients were 70 percent more likely to be hospitalized with infectious gastroenteritis if they were using PPIs, the study found. “The elderly and those with chronic bowel problems are most at risk. These patients should be having a conversation with their doctor to ensure that they are on right dose and that these drugs are the right fit for them,” the authors said. In 2011, consumer advocacy group Public Citizen filed a petition asking the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to place additional information about potential adverse events on PPI warning labels. The agency approved updates to the label in 2014, including language about the risks of acute interstitial nephritis, among other things.

Laxman teaches keen learners during an event organised by P&G Shiksha, a project aimed at providing free and quality education for children.   N.Sudarshan BENGALURU, May 31, 2017 21:24 IST Updated: May 31, 2017 21:25 IST more-in The former player says the team is more experienced than the one that triumphed in 2013 Even as he chose not to comment on the coaching conundrum Indian cricket currently finds itself in, V.V.S. Laxman believed that the team will set aside all distractions as it embarks on its defence of the Champions Trophy title. Laxman, along with Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav Ganguly, is a member of the cricket advisory panel which appointed Anil Kumble as India coach last year and now has to repeat the process. High expectations “You are representing a billion people, there is so much responsibility and expectations,” said Laxman at an event organised by P&G Shiksha, a project aimed at providing free and quality education for children. “I believe that all the distractions will be kept aside. This is the first time Virat Kohli will be leading the side in an ICC tournament. We also need to remember that the 2019 World Cup is going to be in England. If India can do well in this Champions Trophy, then they will go to the World Cup with a lot of confidence. India definitely has a chance to win the title.” Laxman’s confidence perhaps stems from the fact that the current team appears to be an upgrade on the outfit which won the title four years ago. “Definitely more experienced,” Laxman said when asked to compare the two teams. “A lot of players from that side are still part of the core group of this team. “Take the example of Umesh Yadav — the way he has evolved since 2013... more mature, understands his bowling a lot more. He is not only looking to bowl fast — which has always been his strength — but [he is] also bowling with control.” However, Laxman cautioned that for success in the one-day format India’s bowling in the middle overs (15 to 40) must be up to the mark. “In 2013, the bowlers, especially the spinners, were picking up wickets in the middle overs. I am expecting the same [this time]. With the new ball, you can get swing it and pick up wickets. Bhuvneshwar Kumar and [Jasprit] Bumrah are two of the best death bowlers in the world. “But picking up wickets in the middle overs is very important. Once you do this, then you don’t allow a partnership to blossom.” “[Ravindra] Jadeja has evolved into a wicket-taking spinner. And Ashwin is a class bowler. So even though the conditions may not assist them, the two are skilled enough to deceive the batsmen,” said Laxman.

Back in August last year we featured a HOT OR NOT property for sale on Brereton Avenue Cleethorpes. Although the property was full of original features including fireplaces, sash windows and skirting boards if you wished to look round the property it came with a warning to exercise caution as you entered at your own risk! Potential viewers were warned that the floors were rotten in places and the bathroom gave out an unpleasant odour. Property Search For Sale For Sale To Rent Commercial Find an Agent GO Read more: The Victorian home in Grimsby with its own BALL PIT At the time is was up for sale at a modern action for £40,000 and Paul Ablett of P&G Properties bought it, and worked their magic. We caught up with Paul and his son William as they were putting the finishing touches to this very spacious, completely refurbished three bed bedroomed terraced Cleethorpes home. And eight-months down the line you wouldn't recognise the place. After a lot of hard graft from Paul and his team alongside specialist tradesmen, this spacious terraced property is looking it's best and ready for viewers. A proud Paul said: "This is what we do, it's what we're good at. "We buy properties that perhaps have gone too far for people to improve. We refurbish them back to a modern and saleable home," he added. And with 40 years experience in the trade, Paul knows a thing or two about renovating properties, from little flats to an historic Grade II Country Hall in Sheffield. That was until he bought this property on Brereton Avenue! Paul smiled and recalled: “I remember walking in the property and thought, what have I done! “To start with I had to spend £30 on Jeyes Fluid to help get rid of the terrible odours and germs that might be lurking before we could start working on the building. “The downstairs floors were in a terrible state and very dangerous. We had to replace all of the downstairs floorboards and joists. “I don't think I have ever worked on a property so badly far gone before," he added.

Paul said: “There is only so far you can go, depending on it's location, when you weight up the purchase price and the cost of refurbishments etc. “Everyone is on a budget and depending on the type of property and location, you have to know how far you can go, before you price yourself out of the market," Paul added. And walking into number 169, the transformation is stunning. From new double glazed windows, new floors, new carpets, new windows, new ceilings, new plaster, new central heating system, newly rewired, kitchen, new utility room, solid interior doors, new bathroom, low maintenance front and rear gardens Paul and his team have transformed a rundown and neglected property into a spacious three double bedroomed family home overlooking a park. And Paul has certainly worked his magic and is very proud, with not only on the now odourless brand new bathroom but also the kitchen turning it into a kitchen/diner, retaining the bay window making for a spacious living space. With built-in appliances, this room will surely be the heart of this family home. With two further reception rooms there is space for a growing family. Paul's son William, also helped his father on the project as he is interested in following his father's footsteps and did quite a lot of painting and decorating in between attending university. “He enjoyed the project and now Jackson, Green and Preston's have offered him a taster week to learn all about the estate agency and property trade," said Paul. Paul bought the property last year through a 'modern auction' a new process for buying property which some house buyers and developers are not happy with. “This 'modern' way of buying houses through auction is not right," said Paul. “The only advantage to buying this 'modern' way is that you have longer to complete the transaction. “But maybe people don't realise that you have to pay the auctioneers £5,000 plus VAT (total £6,000) up front just to be able to purchase a property."

The Brockville plant – which employs 480 workers – will be permanently closed in late 2020 or early 2021. P&G has operated in Brockville for nearly 40 years.

"We are writing to express our strong support for the United States remaining in the Paris Climate Agreement," it said. "President Trump, stay in Paris and negotiate a better deal that creates jobs," according to the commercial that is also available on YouTube. The advertisement was signed by the heads of 3M, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase, Proctor & Gamble, General Electric, Johnson & Johnson, The Dow Chemical Company, Tesla, Citigroup and The Disney Company. The Paris Agreement, which was spearheaded by former President Barack Obama and signed by 195 countries in April 2016, aims to fight climate change by reducing carbon emissions and limiting global temperature rise to below 2 degrees Celsius. During his election campaign, however, Trump called global warming "a hoax" and promised to scrap the agreement and return jobs to the coal industry that is often an easy target for environmentalists. "I will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!," Trump said via Twitter on Wednesday.

News Sports Living Obits Item Banner Cars Jobs E-Edition Subscriber Services log in Site Site Archive Stocks slide as banks, energy companies sink Wednesday May 31, 2017 at 11:12 AM May 31, 2017 at 4:34 PM The Associated Press NEW YORK — U.S. stocks are slipping for the second day in a row Wednesday, led by a slump in banks as investors worry how their trading businesses are doing this quarter. Energy companies are falling with the price of oil. Big technology companies and small-company stocks are also down. Those declines are canceling out gains for drug companies and household products makers. KEEPING SCORE: The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 4 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,408 as of 2:45 p.m. Eastern time. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 34 points, or 0.2 percent, to 20,995. The Nasdaq composite fell 19 points, or 0.3 percent, to 6,184. The Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks again did worse than the other major indexes. It retreated 5 points, or 0.4 percent, to 1,365. The S&P 500 is on track to finish May with a 1 percent gain. After a three-month losing streak last summer it has risen six out of the last seven months. BANKS: Banks fell as investors worried that their revenue from trading stocks, bonds and currencies is going to weaken in the second quarter. Executives from JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America both spoke about that issue at industry events on Wednesday. Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan said trading revenue will fall 10 percent compared to a year ago. The banking industry had an outstanding first quarter, and trading was a key reason for that. JPMorgan Chase fell $1.87, or 2.2 percent, to $82.03 and Capital One slumped $1.63, or 2.1 percent, to $76.65. Goldman Sachs, which had an unusually bad quarter as its trading business struggled, gave up $7.28, or 3.3 percent, to $211.14. Bond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.20 percent from 2.21 percent. That also hurt banks, as lower bond yields force interest rates lower on loans, reducing banks' profits from lending. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude lost $1.34, or 2.7 percent, to $48.32 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the standard for international oil prices, fell $1.53, or 3 percent, to $50.31 a barrel in London. Energy stocks continued to decline. Chevron sank 61 cents to $103.45 and Hess declined $1.04, or 2.2 percent, to $45.63. FEELING BETTER: Pfizer rose 58 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $32.71 and Irish drugmaker Perrigo climbed $3.71, or 5.5 percent, to $71.63 after its first-quarter report was better than expected. Health care products maker Johnson & Johnson advanced $1.45, or 1.1 percent, to $128.56. Household products companies also rose. Clorox gained $1.31, or 1 percent, to $136.24 and Kimberly-Clark, which makes Huggies diapers and Kleenex tissue, picked up $1.98, or 1.5 percent, to $130.95. Procter & Gamble, which makes Tide detergent and Charmin toilet paper, advanced 77 cents to $88.17. KORS GETS CORED: Michael Kors Holdings hit a five-year low after it said it will close up to 125 stores as its sales have remained weak. The luxury retailer said sales at older stores dropped in its latest quarter and investors were disappointed with its projections for the current quarter. The stock tumbled $3.51, or 9.7 percent, to $32.76. CLOUDY DAY FOR SOLAR: Solar power companies took losses as investors expected President Donald Trump to pull the U.S. out of the Paris climate change agreement. Officials from the European Union said the EU and China will maintain their commitments to the pact. Shares of First Solar, the largest U.S. solar company, declined 92 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $38.58. SunPower fell 23 cents, or 2.8 percent, to $7.92 while solar wafer maker Canadian Solar retreated 73 cents, or 5.4 percent, to $12.81. HITTING RESET: Technology companies turned lower. The tech sector has reached its highest levels since the dot-com boom and companies like Apple, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook have done far better than the rest of the market in 2017. Apple and Facebook are up 32 percent this year, and Alphabet is up 24 percent. All three slid Wednesday. CURRENCIES: The dollar slipped to 110.68 yen from 110.78 yen. The euro rose to $1.1239 from $1.1188. The British pound rose to $1.2882 from $1.2813. The currency was volatile after polls and surveys showed the general election on June 8 might be closer than expected. Early on, observers expected the Conservative Party of Prime Minister Theresa May to win in a landslide. May supports Britain's exit from the European Union, and if she wins a smaller majority, it could hurt her side as Britain negotiates its departure from the union. OTHER ENERGY TRADING: Wholesale gasoline lost 3 cents to $1.61 a gallon. Heating oil gave up 3 cents to $1.52 a gallon. Natural gas dropped 7 cents to $3.07 per 1,000 cubic feet. METALS: Gold rose $9.70 to $1,265.40 an ounce. Silver fell 2 cents to $17.41 an ounce. Copper gained 2 cents to $2.58 a pound. OVERSEAS: European stocks gave up an early gain. The DAX in Germany remained up 0.1 percent, but France's CAC 40 lost 0.4 percent and the British FTSE 100 fell 0.1 percent. Japan's Nikkei 225 index dipped 0.1 percent and South Korea's Kospi gained 0.2 percent. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong inched down 0.1 percent.

PTI file image. Despite the off-field tensions, India have made the right beginning to their Champions Trophy title defence by producing fine performances in the two warm-up games. Staying away from controversies and focusing on the responsibilities at hand will be the best way forward for the men-in-blue, feels legendary batsman VVS Laxman. If the uncertainty over their participation in the tournament was the first controversy that hit them, the team is once again in focus, this time over an alleged rift between skipper Virat Kohli and coach Anil Kumble. Despite the negative stories, Laxman is confident the players will concentrate only on the campaign. “I believe that all the distractions will be kept aside when the team walks on to the park. The way they performed in the warm-up games shows they are focusing on the job at hand. When you play for your country, all you want to do is go out and give your best. You are representing a billion people, there is so much expectations. We also need to remember that the 2019 ICC World Cup is in England. If India can do well in this Champions Trophy, then they go to that World Cup with a lot of confidence,” Laxman said on the sidelines of P&G Shiksha Superhero, an initiative to educate and impact the lives of underprivileged children. India do not enjoy a good record against their arch-rivals in Champions Trophy, winning only one of their three encounters so far. “It’s good to get the tough match at first. I have always believed that when you play against Pakistan it is important to remove all the distractions from your mind. India must focus on the task at hand and I am sure Virat will be telling his team the same. The idea is to go out, express themselves and play their natural game,” the former India batsman explained. When India lifted their second Champions Trophy title in 2013, it was a young side that clicked as a group. Laxman felt the current squad is better thanks to the experience it holds. “Definitely, this squad is more experienced. A lot of players from that side are still the nucleus of this team. Every player evolves. Take the example of Umesh Yadav... the way he has evolved since 2013.. more mature, understands his bowling a lot more,” he noted.

Chipmaker Analog Devices is up after its quarterly results were better than Wall Street had expected. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) BEIJING (AP) — Chinese stocks declined Thursday after a survey showed manufacturing weakening while other Asian markets gained after Wall Street fell for a second day. KEEPING SCORE: The Shanghai Composite Index lost 0.5 percent to 3,102.21 while Tokyo's Nikkei 225 gained 1 percent to 19,854.27. Hong Kong's Hang Seng advanced 0.4 percent to 25,752.44 and Seoul's Kospi shed 0.1 percent to 2,344.29. Sydney's S&P-ASX 200 gained 0.2 percent to 5,733.90 and benchmarks in New Zealand, Taiwan and Southeast Asia also advanced. WALL STREET: U.S. stocks fell on a sharp drop for banks and a rare loss for tech companies. That offset gains for drug makers and consumer-focused companies. Banks fell after executives from JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America said their trading businesses are having a rough second quarter. Energy companies fell with oil prices. Investors picked consumer-focused companies, drug makers and high-dividend utilities and household goods companies. The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost less than 0.1 percent to 2,411.80. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 0.1 percent to 21,008.65. CHINESE MANUFACTURING: The Chinese business magazine Caixin said its purchasing managers' index declined for a third month, falling to 49.6 from April's 50.3 on a 100-point scale on which numbers below 50 show activity contracting. That came after a separate PMI on Wednesday by the National Bureau of Statistics and an industry group, the China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing, improved to 54.5 from 54. "Yesterday's official PMI reading had hinted at growth having remained broadly stable last month," said Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics in a report. "But today's downbeat unofficial PMI suggests conditions may not have held up as well as previously thought." Get news headlines sent daily to your inbox Sign Up!

TRUMP AND CLIMATE: President Donald Trump was preparing to announce a decision on whether to pull the United States out of the Paris climate accord. Trump promoted his announcement Wednesday night on Twitter, after a day in which U.S. allies around the world sounded alarms about the likely consequences of a U.S. withdrawal. Trump himself kept everyone in suspense, saying he was still listening to "a lot of people both ways." Abandoning the pact would isolate the U.S. from allies who spent years negotiating the 2015 agreement to fight global warming by reducing carbon emissions. Withdrawing would leave the United States aligned only with Russia among the world's industrialized economies. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. oil gained 38 cents to $48.70 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract plunged $1.34 on Wednesday to close at $48.32.

Democrat photo by Amanda Williams FacebookTwitter FacebookTwitter DayOne Response Amy Cagle, an El Dorado County native who grew up in Pleasant Valley, knew she wanted to be a humanitarian in some fashion – she is doing just that. “We provide clean water for disaster relief. With any type of dirty water, including wastewater or highly contaminated water, the water bags turn it into clean water in 30 minutes. They are lightweight and easy to use.  The water bags remove all of the bacteria and viruses from the water” said Cagle. DayOne Response has brought their water bags to several locations across the globe, including Nepal after a severe earthquake, in Haiti after a typhoon and in the Philippines. Right now, DayOne is responding to East Africa as tit is experiencing a drought. An ah-ha moment for Cagle, she said, was a humanitarian relief effort DayOne responded to in Benin, West Africa. “The water had the color of chocolate milk and I saw it change to clear in the DayOne bag – it’s a life changing moment,” Cagle said. Cagle and the co-founder of the company, Trisha Markman, met in college when the idea came about. In 2010 the women started working together and idea turned into reality. Both women work as a team. Cagle is more the business side and Markman is more the engineering side, Cagle said. DayOne Response bags are for sale at the Placerville Hardware store on Main Street and are good for anyone wanting to go to a remote location where there may not be clean water available. Albert Fausel, third generation owner of Placerville Hardware, said he is excited to carry the merchandise. “I have been looking for a company like this.  For anyone who is going up to the high country this is a good thing to have,” Fausel said. How it works: A multiple treatment process is used for filtration of possible contaminated water to make it ready to drink. The package contains P&G flocculant/disinfectant packets and a turbidity filter. Simply fill the bag, which can hold up to 2.5 gallons, up to the fill-line, open one of the packets and add its contents to the water bag. Close it tightly and mix the contents of the packet with the water “vigorously” as it says on the packaging – wait 25 minutes before drinking. When the process of turning the dirty water to consumable water is finished, the water will be clear. The ladies at DayOne Response don’t seem to be slowing down anytime soon and would like to have a filtration system in a DayOne Response water bag someday that turns salt water into drinkable water.       FacebookTwitter Amanda Williams Story Archive Search Recent Posts RUSD’s Swart signs off as super Caltrans District 3 employees awarded California’s Medal of Valor Grow For It!

KEEPING SCORE: The Shanghai Composite Index lost 0.5 percent to 3,102.21 while Tokyo's Nikkei 225 gained 1 percent to 19,854.27. Hong Kong's Hang Seng advanced 0.4 percent to 25,752.44 and Seoul's Kospi shed 0.1 percent to 2,344.29. Sydney's S&P-ASX 200 gained 0.2 percent to 5,733.90 and benchmarks in New Zealand, Taiwan and Southeast Asia also advanced. WALL STREET: U.S. stocks fell on a sharp drop for banks and a rare loss for tech companies. That offset gains for drug makers and consumer-focused companies. Banks fell after executives from JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America said their trading businesses are having a rough second quarter. Energy companies fell with oil prices. Investors picked consumer-focused companies, drug makers and high-dividend utilities and household goods companies. The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost less than 0.1 percent to 2,411.80. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 0.1 percent to 21,008.65. CHINESE MANUFACTURING: The Chinese business magazine Caixin said its purchasing managers' index declined for a third month, falling to 49.6 from April's 50.3 on a 100-point scale on which numbers below 50 show activity contracting. That came after a separate PMI on Wednesday by the National Bureau of Statistics and an industry group, the China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing, improved to 54.5 from 54. "Yesterday's official PMI reading had hinted at growth having remained broadly stable last month," said Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics in a report. "But today's downbeat unofficial PMI suggests conditions may not have held up as well as previously thought." TRUMP AND CLIMATE: President Donald Trump was preparing to announce a decision on whether to pull the United States out of the Paris climate accord. Trump promoted his announcement Wednesday night on Twitter, after a day in which U.S. allies around the world sounded alarms about the likely consequences of a U.S. withdrawal. Trump himself kept everyone in suspense, saying he was still listening to "a lot of people both ways." Abandoning the pact would isolate the U.S. from allies who spent years negotiating the 2015 agreement to fight global warming by reducing carbon emissions. Withdrawing would leave the United States aligned only with Russia among the world's industrialized economies. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. oil gained 38 cents to $48.70 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract plunged $1.34 on Wednesday to close at $48.32. Brent crude, used to price international oils, advanced 40 cents to $51.16 in London. It dropped $1.48 the previous session. CURRENCY: The dollar gained to 110.92 yen from Wednesday's 110.76. The euro edged down to $1.1244 from $1.1247. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

Investors picked consumer-focused companies, drug makers and high-dividend utilities and household goods companies. The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost less than 0.1 percent to 2,411.80. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 0.1 percent to 21,008.65. CHINESE MANUFACTURING: The Chinese business magazine Caixin said its purchasing managers' index declined for a third month, falling to 49.6 from April's 50.3 on a 100-point scale on which numbers below 50 show activity contracting. That came after a separate PMI on Wednesday by the National Bureau of Statistics and an industry group, the China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing, improved to 54.5 from 54. "Yesterday's official PMI reading had hinted at growth having remained broadly stable last month," said Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics in a report. "But today's downbeat unofficial PMI suggests conditions may not have held up as well as previously thought." TRUMP AND CLIMATE: President Donald Trump was preparing to announce a decision on whether to pull the United States out of the Paris climate accord. Trump promoted his announcement Wednesday night on Twitter, after a day in which U.S. allies around the world sounded alarms about the likely consequences of a U.S. withdrawal. Trump himself kept everyone in suspense, saying he was still listening to "a lot of people both ways." Abandoning the pact would isolate the U.S. from allies who spent years negotiating the 2015 agreement to fight global warming by reducing carbon emissions. Withdrawing would leave the United States aligned only with Russia among the world's industrialized economies. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. oil gained 38 cents to $48.70 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract plunged $1.34 on Wednesday to close at $48.32. Brent crude, used to price international oils, advanced 40 cents to $51.16 in London. It dropped $1.48 the previous session. CURRENCY: The dollar gained to 110.92 yen from Wednesday's 110.76. The euro edged down to $1.1244 from $1.1247. Top Stories Appeals court rules on Crystal Boyett's request for new trial Court overturns man's murder conviction of Vidor teen Tyler Co.

(AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) Posted: Wednesday, May 31, 2017 10:58 am | Updated: 12:41 pm, Wed May 31, 2017. US stocks slide further as banks and energy companies sink Associated Press | 0 comments NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stock indexes edged lower for the second day in a row Wednesday as a sharp drop for banks and a rare loss for technology companies canceled out gains for drugmakers and consumer-focused companies. Banks fell hard as executives from JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America said their trading businesses are having a rough second quarter. An eight-day winning streak for technology companies ended. Energy companies fell with oil prices. Investors picked consumer-focused companies, drugmakers, and high-dividend utilities and household goods companies. The New York Stock Exchange was evenly split between gainers and losers. "The stock market has been strong and all the while bond yields have dropped during the year," signaling caution about the economy, said Brent Schutte, chief investment strategist for Northwestern Mutual Management. "In the next couple of months we're going to solve which is right: the bond market or the stock market." The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 1.11 points, or less than 0.1 percent, to 2,411.80. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 20.82 points, or 0.1 percent, to 21,008.65. The Nasdaq composite fell 4.67 points, or 0.1 percent, to 6,198.52. The Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks slipped 0.99 points, or 0.1 percent, to 1,370.21. Banks skidded a day earlier as bond yields dropped, which hurts banks by forcing interest rates on loans lower. Yields were little changed Wednesday, but financial firms fell again as investors worried that banks' revenue from trading stocks, bonds and currencies is going to weaken in the second quarter. At a financial industry conference in New York, Marianne Lake, JPMorgan Chase's chief financial officer, said JPMorgan's trading revenue is down about 15 percent this quarter because of a drop in fixed-income trading. She said that was because of low interest rates and remarkably low market volatility. "There is not a lot to trade around," she said. "People have cash but no conviction." At a different industry event Wednesday, Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan said second-quarter trading revenue will fall 10 percent compared to a year ago. The banking industry had an outstanding first quarter, and trading was a key reason. JPMorgan Chase fell $1.75, or 2.1 percent, to $82.15 and Bank of America lost 43 cents, or 1.9 percent, to $22.41. Capital One slumped $1.36, or 1.7 percent, to $76.92 and Goldman Sachs, which saw its vaunted trading business hit a speed bump in the first quarter, gave up $7.16, or 3.3 percent, to $211.26. Bond prices were little changed. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note remained at 2.21 percent. Technology companies turned lower. The tech sector has reached its highest levels since the dot-com boom and companies like Apple, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook have done far better than the rest of the market in 2017. Apple and Facebook are up 32 percent this year, and Alphabet is up 25 percent. All three slid Wednesday. Pfizer rose 52 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $32.65 and Irish drugmaker Perrigo climbed $4,93, or 7.3 percent, to $72.85 after its first-quarter report was better than expected. Health care products maker Johnson & Johnson advanced $1.14 to $128.25. Benchmark U.S. crude lost $1.34, or 2.7 percent, to $48.32 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the standard for international oil prices, fell $1.53, or 3 percent, to $50.31 a barrel in London. Energy stocks continued to decline. Exxon Mobil sank 60 cents to $80.50 and Hess declined 78 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $45.89. Michael Kors Holdings hit a five-year low after it said it will close up to 125 stores as its sales have remained weak. The luxury retailer said sales at older stores dropped in its latest quarter and investors were disappointed with its projections for the current quarter. The stock tumbled $3.09, or 8.5 percent, to $33.18. Solar power companies sank as investors wondered if President Donald Trump will seek to remove the U.S. from the Paris climate change accords. Officials from the European Union said the EU and China will maintain their commitments to the pact. Shares of First Solar, the largest U.S. solar company, declined 99 cents, or 2.5 percent, to $38.51. SunPower fell 28 cents, or 3.4 percent, to $7.87 while solar wafer maker Canadian Solar retreated 73 cents, or 5.4 percent, to $12.81. The dollar slipped to 110.57 yen from 110.78 yen. The euro rose to $1.1246 from $1.1188. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline lost 3 cents to $1.61 a gallon. Heating oil gave up 3 cents to $1.52 a gallon. Natural gas dropped 7 cents to $3.07 per 1,000 cubic feet. Gold rose $9.70 to $1,265.40 an ounce. Silver fell 2 cents to $17.41 an ounce. Copper gained 2 cents to $2.58 a pound. European stocks gave up an early gain. The DAX in Germany remained up 0.1 percent, but France's CAC 40 lost 0.4 percent and the British FTSE 100 fell 0.1 percent. Japan's Nikkei 225 index dipped 0.1 percent and South Korea's Kospi gained 0.2 percent. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong inched down 0.1 percent. ___ AP Markets Writer Marley Jay contributed to this story.

Scrap tires take up far too much space, they can spawn devastating tire fires that burn for weeks or even months when stored together in large numbers, and they they leach chemicals into soil and groundwater. Recycling is an absolute necessity, but not easily done. Most developed countries have produced millions of scrap tires (at the very least), and many developing country are either already there or well on their way to having a similar massive recycling problem on their hands. Scrap tires also provide perfect breeding grounds for mosquitoes. Mosquitoes are bad enough in the US, but it’s fairly rare for them to carry disease. Not so in South American countries, especially those sitting so close to the equator, like Venezuela. Mosquitoes easily flourish there without the extra help of stagnant rainwater sitting in old tires, and these mosquitoes’ bites pack some infamously nasty diseases, including Zika virus and malaria. Malaria had completely disappeared from Venezuela for half a century, but it has come back with a vengeance in recent years, with nearly 23,000 cases reported in spring of 2014 alone. The vast majority of the country is still labeled as a malaria transmission area by the CDC today, despite efforts to reduce the mosquito populations. New tire recycling efforts in Venezuela will help to bring the mosquito populations down further and eliminate the threat of these viruses. Sharing the Solution The global nature of the scrap tire problem is why it’s so critical for companies like Eco Green to take their high-powered shredding machinery into the worldwide market and act as leaders in the tire recycling industry. Which is exactly what Eco Green has been doing since 2008, when we first started working with Latin American companies. Now, instead of being leaders in the awful race towards having the biggest, most dangerous tire stockpile, developed countries can use the crumb rubber coming out of ECO Crumblers to pave the way towards legitimate green solutions. That doesn’t mean it’s easy. Doing business across borders can be delicate and challenging even in times of economic growth and prosperity. During periods of unrest, many companies prefer to retreat to comfortable home territory and not risk losing profit or getting tangled up in international politics. Eco Green Equipment is not one of those companies. Why Venezuela? Latin America is home to some of Eco Green’s oldest international customers, and that includes Venezuela, where we’re still going strong in spite of the economic upheaval caused by falling oil prices and the conflict surrounding the Maduro regime. Several big-name US companies, such as Bridgestone, General Mills, Ford Motor Co., General Motors, Kimberly-Clark, and Procter & Gamble have all scaled back their operations in Venezuela because of the political and economic instability, hyperinflation, and the tendency of the socialist government to seize their local facilities and assets. However, Eco Green hasn’t been conducting its business with Venezuela in the same way. These companies had factories and plants in the country, and this level of investment is a large part of what made them vulnerable. Eco Green does not maintain operations in Venezuela, it merely sells tire shredding equipment to Venezuelan companies. One such company we’d like to focus on is Eco Transformadora de Gomas. Eco Transformadora de Gomas With seven of its cities ranking 49th, 34th, 24th, 20th, 7th, 5th, and 1st on a list of the world’s most dangerous cities, Venezuela is certainly a scary place to be overall, but the city of Turmero and the neighboring state capital Maracay are nowhere on that list. Turmero is home to Transformadora de Gomas and their booming tire recycling plant. This Venezuelan company’s stated purpose is to collect, recycle, and transform out-of-use tires. They encourage other entrepreneurs to encourage waste recycling across their country, and they have a vision to “develop a model of social contribution through the installation of a tire recycling plant in Aragua state.” Furthermore, they want to see the recycled tires all the way to their new destination, whether that be playground equipment and surface, turf for sports fields, floor slabs, or a number of other applications. Transformadora de Gomas is not a new customer. Almost three years ago, they purchased an ECO Crumbler Granulator, and they’ve been adding to their operation ever since. They now own a complete lineup of Eco Green’s machines, including the ECO Krumbuster® System, an ECO Green Giant, and a second ECO Crumbler Granulator. They are able to process used car and truck tires at an average rate of 750 per hour. Until halfway through 2016 when a mining company opened one in Colombia, there wasn’t a large-scale tire recycling operation anywhere in South America. With the tire shredding equipment bought from Eco Green, Transformadora de Gomas has added another plant to the map, one that our own CEO, Brad Swenson, acknowledges as “one of the best tire recycling facilities [he’s] been in.” He anticipates doing further business with Transformadora de Gomas as demand for shredded tires and crumb rubber continues to grow. Eurek Adrian, owner of the Venezuelan company, feels equally satisfied with what Eco Green’s equipment has allowed and will allow him to achieve. In their capable hands, our machines will be able to grind all the hazards posed by scrap tires to literal crumbs. In such desperate economic times, the metal and rubber produced by shredding tires will prove vital to essential industries such as road paving, roofing, and automobile production. The tire recycling plant won’t just recycle tires; it will play a role in stimulating Venezuela’s economy. Join the Fight If you or your company, like Transformadora de Gomas, are ready to join in the worldwide fight to turn dangerous, mosquito-infested mountains of scrap tires into usable materials, then contact our experts to learn more about how Eco Green can help you make it happen. It’s never too late to start making the world a better, safer, and greener place. Customer comments No comments were found for International Tire Recycling Spotlight: Venezuela.

To help families stay safe, the American Red Cross is issuing the top six hurricane preparedness tips should a hurricane or tropical storm head for your community. Here are the top six things you should do now to be ready for Hurricane Season 2017: Talk with household members and create an evacuation plan. Be prepared to evacuate quickly and evacuate if told to do so. Build an emergency kit with a gallon of water per person, per day, non-perishable food, a flashlight, battery-powered radio, first aid kit, medications, supplies for an infant if applicable, a multi-purpose tool, personal hygiene items, copies of important papers, cell phone chargers, extra cash, blankets, maps of the area, and emergency contact information. Get access to NOAA radio broadcasts. Purchase a battery-powered or hand-crank NOAA weather radio in the Red Cross Store. Protect windows with permanent storm shutters or invest in one-half inch marine plywood that is pre-cut to fit your doors and windows. Identify a place to store lawn furniture, toys, gardening tools and trash cans (away from stairs and exits) to prevent them from being moved by high winds and possibly hurting someone. Be informed. Learn about your community’s hurricane response plan. Plan routes to local shelters, register family members with special medical needs as required and make plans for pets. If travel is in your plans, learn about how emergency situations are communicated at your destination. Download the free Red Cross Emergency App for expert guidance on what to do before, during and after hurricanes as well as 34 other types of emergencies. All Red Cross apps can be found in smartphone app stores by searching for American Red Cross or by going to redcross.org/apps. If someone already has a disaster kit, now is the time make sure the food and water is still okay to consume and that copies of important documents are up to date. If an emergency plan already exists for the household, family members should talk about it again so everyone knows what to do and where to go if an emergency occurs.

It’s no longer niche and it’s no longer negligible. Here Cosmetics Design examines all things indie—what’s trending, how conventional beauty is responding, and more. Bringing something new to market is always a risk. The innovative technology behind the Youth Revealed Anti-Aging Skin Care Masks from Nannette de Gaspé Beauté (as mentioned in part 1 of this article ) for example had no precedent in beauty. It’s commonly indie beauty brands that test the market readiness of new products and concepts. Trending Bold indie brands are often on the leading edge (if not ahead of the curve) of what’s coming next in beauty, fragrance, and personal care. While industry giants like IFF Lucas Meyer and Johnson & Johnson are researching and slowly rolling out products that engage productively with the skin or scalp’s microbiome, brands like Mother Dirt and Gallinée have already taken the wonder and science of bacteria as the focus of their brands. Just as environmentalism and corporate social responsibility have become cherished initiatives for multinational corporations, cultural and societal causes have inspired entire indie brands, like Pinch of Colour . The brand founded by Linda Treska not only makes lip color and complexion products without water but also works closely with water conservation causes worldwide. All natural fragrance is a trendy niche thanks to forward-thinking brands like Pour le Monde. In a Two Views piece on Cosmetics Design late last year that brand’s founder Wendi Berger, commented that, “in the three years since Pour le Monde launched, there has been enormous growth in the natural beauty space as more consumers question ingredients found in personal care. They scrutinize and hold companies accountable and expect transparency, efficacy, sustainably sourced ingredients and cruelty free products.” The rise in hair and color cosmetics for non-Caucasian consumers has also been nudged forward by the indie beauty movement. “Finally, we’re seeing products and services—created by people of color—that address the beauty needs of women of color in authentic ways,” Jihan Thompson, co-founder and CEO of Swivel Beauty, an app that helps women of color find the right salon and stylist, told Cosmetics Design . As the app exemplifies, digital technology makes it easier for new brands and services to reach consumers directly. And indie seems to be where the athleisure trend got a running start. Scarcely an article goes by about active beauty in the consumer media that doesn’t mention the innovative Sweat Cosmetics brand . And indie beauty brands led that trend in terms of simplicity (like Feather & Bone face gems ), portability (like Stowaway Cosmetics ), and practicality (like Switch Fresh ) too. Funding Money talks. Big beauty has adopted an entrepreneurial attitude and embraced indie beauty, with awards, through incubators, and with investments or acquisitions. Startups are all the rage and competitions like the L’Oreal NEXT awards (this year’s application deadline in June 17) create a space where the latest outside-the-box tech and innovation can cross-pollinate with the experience and reach of big beauty.   Incubators for finished goods brands like P&G’s Preneur project and for startup supply-side companies like Johnson & Johnson’s JLABS , for individual entrepreneurs like Sephora Accelerate —these all act as catalysts to advance indie and to inspire legacy brands to borrow and build on the best of what’s new. Venture capitalists, investment firms, and bankers, all have a keen interest in indie beauty today; and it’s as much for that reason as it is for the disruptive, entrepreneurial spirit of the whole thing that indie beauty is here to stay.

KEEPING SCORE: The Shanghai Composite Index lost 0.5 per cent to 3,101.37 while Tokyo's Nikkei 225 gained 1.1 per cent to 19,867.93. Hong Kong's Hang Seng advanced 0.3 per cent to 25,749.34 and Seoul's Kospi shed 0.1 per cent to 2,344.14. Sydney's S&P-ASX 200 was little-changed at 5,730.90 and India's Sensex also was unchanged at 31,164.38. Benchmarks in New Zealand, Taiwan and Southeast Asia advanced. WALL STREET: U.S. stocks fell on a sharp drop for banks and a rare loss for tech companies. That offset gains for drug makers and consumer-focused companies. Banks fell after executives from JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America said their trading businesses are having a rough second quarter. Energy companies fell with oil prices. Investors picked consumer-focused companies, drug makers and high-dividend utilities and household goods companies. The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost less than 0.1 per cent to 2,411.80. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 0.1 per cent to 21,008.65. CHINESE MANUFACTURING: The Chinese business magazine Caixin said its purchasing managers' index declined for a third month, falling to 49.6 from April's 50.3 on a 100-point scale on which numbers below 50 show activity contracting. That came after a separate PMI on Wednesday by the National Bureau of Statistics and an industry group, the China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing, improved to 54.5 from 54. "Yesterday's official PMI reading had hinted at growth having remained broadly stable last month," said Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics in a report. "But today's downbeat unofficial PMI suggests conditions may not have held up as well as previously thought." TRUMP AND CLIMATE: President Donald Trump was preparing to announce whether he will pull the United States out of the 150-nation Paris climate accord. Trump promoted his announcement Wednesday night on Twitter, after a day in which U.S. allies around the world sounded alarms about the likely consequences of a U.S. withdrawal. Trump said he still was listening to "a lot of people both ways." Abandoning the pact would isolate the U.S. from allies who spent years negotiating the 2015 agreement to fight global warming by reducing carbon emissions. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. oil gained 48 cents to $48.80 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract plunged $1.34 on Wednesday to close at $48.32. Brent crude, used to price international oils, advanced 45 cents to $51.21 in London. It dropped $1.48 the previous session. CURRENCY: The dollar gained to 110.95 yen from Wednesday's 110.76. The euro edged down to $1.1246 from $1.1247.       E-mail this Article Print this Article Share this Article           Story Tools   E-mail this Article Print this Article Share this Article   Font: * * * * *   Image: * * * *     Related Topics   business The Canadian Press 2017         Business Videos         Most Popular canada.com E-mailed Shared     Sponsored By           FP Business Wire »   FP Business Wire   GSMA Reveals Shortlist for 2017 Asia Mobile Awards NTT DATA Announces Strategic Investment and Expands Business Alliance with MarkLogic Gensource Announces First Closing of up to $6,000,000 Private Placement           News Business Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Health Travel Technology Don't Miss: Happening Now Video Centre Live chats Blogs on canada.com canada.com on Facebook Most Popular Formats Sitemap / RSS Contests Blogs Photo Galleries Videos Canada.com About Us Contact Us Advertise with Us FAQs Tools Canada.com Search for a Job Buy / Sell a Car Infomart Place a Classified Ad Newsletters and Alerts Flyercity.ca About canada.com | Privacy Statement | Terms | Copyright & Permissions © 2010-2017 Postmedia Network Inc.
