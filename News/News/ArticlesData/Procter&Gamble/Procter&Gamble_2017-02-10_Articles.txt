Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Saturday, 11 February 2017 P&G Malaysia backs MRC viewability standards by daljit dhesi Nadiah: ‘For media buys, viewability is one of several important factors that we consider.’ P&G Malaysia is working closely with its partners to adopt the US-based Media Rating Council (MRC) viewability standards for digital media as well as reviewing agency contracts following the recent call by its parent Procter & Gamble Company (P&G) for greater transparency rules in digital advertising. Although the move has drawn mixed reactions from marketers and agencies, the company’s communications and government relations leader (Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei) Nadiah Syed Nahar tells StarBizWeek that it will follow through and adopt the MRC standard. P&G Malaysia is a subsidiary of Procter & Gamble Company of the US, which is the biggest advertiser in the world. She says P&G’s ruling are relevant and applicable globally, including in Malaysia. Many of P&G’s digital partners (Google, Facebook, etc) are global, she says, adding that the company will work with its partners and agencies on these issues. “Right now, at minimum, our focus is on the adoption of MRC viewability standard to enable comparative measurement and learning. For media buys, viewability is one of several important factors that we consider. We work with our partners on the specifics as to how we buy media from them. We are also currently reviewing agency contracts. “I can’t divulge at this stage except the fact that we are aligned with P&G’s chief brand officer Marc Pritchard’s direction and intent of reviewing agency contracts. We have begun that work and it will continue on the timing that it takes,” she says. MediaCom is P&G’s media agency in Malaysia. Last month, Pritchard stressed that there was a need for a thorough review of all media-agency contracts plus requirements that everyone use industry-standard viewability metrics, fraud protection and third-party verification. The new rules scheduled to be out this year include requiring funds to be used for media payments only, ie, payments or fees should be matched with the services rendered. All rebates, at the same time, should be disclosed and returned as well as transactions being subjected to audit. Another is the endorsement by P&G of the controversial MRC viewability standards for digital media. It defines a viewable impression as requiring a minimum of 50% of pixels in view for one consecutive second for display and two consecutive seconds for video. Industry players agree there should be a common viewability standard in the advertising industry in the country as currently there are no fixed standards or measurements.  Tags / Keywords: Earnings , Economy , Advertising & Media , P G Related Stories MAS brings unity to new heights Malaysia an important part of China’s Asean expansion Serba Dinamik debuts on Bursa with 2 sen premium TA Global subsidiary completes Trump hotel acquisition F&N sees margins to remain pressured, acts to maintain revenue and profit growth You May Be Interested Mah Sing on transformation mode BBCC developer signs deal for Zepp concert hall Leong has come a full circle Spritzer starts UK exports P&G Malaysia backs MRC viewability standards Experiencing painful menses?

February 9, 2017 10:36 by KIM PORTRATE 3 Ten points to Marc Pritchard for making his “not sexy” marketing topics as sexy as all hell last week. If common sense prevails, the themes of his address at IAB’s Annual Leadership meeting in Florida will actually prove to be the industry’s sexiest topics of 2017. Last week P&G’s chief brand officer caned large swathes of the online advertising industry for a string of shortcomings that the world’s biggest advertiser is no longer willing to avert its gaze from. Pritchard put us all on notice. All the industry’s sacred cows – ludicrous viewability standards, the rise of bot and methbot fraud along with online ad platforms marking their own scorecards – were put under the microscope in a scorching and fearless speech. And in probably the most pragmatic assessment of the modern marketing playbook, he admitted that P&G, like many others, has been distracted by the “latest shiny objects” and taken its eyes off real stuff: like demanding to know what it is paying for. Now, I don’t think any one group – marketers or agencies or media owners – owns this issue but I do think it’s time to take a collective look and inject common sense back into the work we do. You know, the basic rules that seem to have been suspended in a mad rush to embrace the cult of the shiny and new. So let’s have a look at Pritchard’s views and see why they are set to become the industry’s hottest topics of 2017. 1. Viewability, anyone? P&G, he said, spends too much time comparing the contrary viewability metrics of Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat, Pinterest, YouTube and others. Take a squizz at the table below and you can see his point: the definition of what constitutes a “view” is, not to put too fine a point on it, a total soup. The reports that emerge from these inconsistencies – big numbers from global internet companies to impress, confuse and obfuscate – are what I call ‘Numberwanging’ (our candidate for the sexiest marketing word of 2017). The lack of standards creates confusion and cost and all too often the numbers shed no light on reality or the key metrics marketers are interested in – the ones that show an impact on profitable sales. There’s also the big question of whether your online video ads are actually viewable on the screen. “Not nearly as reliably as you’d like”, according to Nielsen. Generally, 50% of digital ad impressions aren’t viewable, said the research house in late 2015. “Of course, if an ad isn’t viewable, it will have no impact,” added Nielsen. “If you’re going to go all-digital, your agency must address the viewability issue or you will be wasting a good part of your media spend.” You certainly will, according to a report by Integral Ad Science Report in September 2016 which also found that more than half of Australia’s digital ad inventory remained unviewed. And that’s assuming your digital ads will actually be delivered to the audience you target. Nielsen data on more than 30,000 digital ad campaigns showed that only about 60% of digital ad impressions reach the intended audience. TV, of course, is different. Broadcast TV ads take up 100% of the screen 100% of the time. It’s viewability on steroids. Not only that but OzTAM’s third-party measurement panel system ensures that the ad and the program have to be played at normal speed – with the sound on – to be credited in the ratings. If only the same could be said of the interweb, which us leads to another of Pritchard’s bugbears. 2. Bot fraud The staggering scale of bot and methbot fraud was underlined just before Christmas when security firm White Ops revealed that a group of Russian criminals are making up to US$5 million every day in the biggest digital ad fraud ever uncovered and perpetrated by faking clicks on online video ads. These crafty crims create tons of fake impressions and tons of fake actions to get tons of real money from brands. It’s a bit like placing your ad in a free newspaper and stumbling across a stack of them dumped at the tip a million miles high, wrappers still on. It underscores the inherent risks of buying blind through programmatic exchanges rather than through a trusted, premium publisher. And so to Pritchard (and Portrate’s) final pet peeve. Kim Portrate: ThinkTV 3. “Media that mark their own homework” Pritchard was refreshingly blunt on the “ridiculousness” of the current situation where massive online platforms like Facebook and Google craft performance figures with no accredited third-party measurement verification. Online platforms can work fantastically well for many advertisers, in particular when mixed with other mediums, but – as Pritchard pointed out – regardless of how much we trust and respect the people from whom we buy media, we need an “objective and impartial judge to perform the measurement”. He said: “We have this for TV but not broadly in place for digital, despite the fact that Nielsen, Moat and many others have the capabilities. Instead we have too many who are self-reporting, and incredibly we as clients are still tolerating it.” Clients who use OzTAM’s third-party measurement panel can sleep soundly tonight knowing it is independent and audited, and is about to increase by 50% in size this year, making Australia the largest per capita people metered market in the world. Brands should tolerate nothing less, just as you should expect the same rigour from every platform you spend your precious money with. So here’s to three of the industry’s raciest topics for 2017: viewability, third-party verification, and protection from bot fraud. Let’s put our heads together and bring sexy back. It’s good for all of us, you know it feels right, and it will ultimately mean growth for brands. topics Facebook, kim portrate, Marc Pritchard, OzTam, television, ThinkTV Share Tweet Share Comments: 3 Add Comment hi 9 Feb 17 I’m confused – haven’t you just repeated Marc Pritchard’s talk – it’s not an opinion piece if you just paraphrase Marc’s talk. Your opinion could have just been – I agree with Marc, and being the CEO of Think TV it’s hardly surprising. The issue with going hard on agreeing with someone else so emphatically, and not adding to the debate, you are undermining not just yourself – but his opinion too, as you are coming from such a biased perspective. I’d encourage Think TV to let others do the talking, or at the very least find your own words and arguments to add to the debate. Reply deja vu 9 Feb 17 Sounds like 2016.

According to an announcement, which was made during a meeting of the United Nations Secretary-General's High Level Panel on Women's Economic Empowerment, which was held for the first time in the Middle East region and hosted by the UAE Gender Balance Council, the implementation of P&G's commitment will include four key areas for 2017, which will be undertaken in partnership with UN Women and other female-empowerment organizations. Mohamed Samir, IMEA President for P&G, said: "P&G has been championing the cause of gender equality both inside and outside of P&G, leveraging the strengths of our business and operations, our scale and our advertising voice to address gender bias and enable education for girls and women's economic empowerment." For one, P&G will expand its supplier development and sourcing from women-owned business in our supply chains across the world, including the Indian subcontinent, Middle East and Africa. It will continue to reveal gender bias and spark conversations through P&G brand advertising campaigns and encourage the wider advertising industry to do the same. In addition, the company said it will extend its programmes to keep girls in school in India, Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa, and Tanzania. Working with its NGO partners on the ground, P&G said it will empower women & girls impacted by the Syrian refugee crisis to realize their potential. In India, P&G hires 50% women into entry level management roles and they get promoted into next assignments at the same progression as men. The company's Hyderabad plant was one of the first plants to have 30% women across the workforce. P&G was the also the first consumer goods company with a license to employ women in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) and now employs 15% women managers in KSA across all commercial disciplines including finance, HR, sales & marketing.

Attracting about 111 million viewers based on Nielsen's estimates, Super Bowl 51 wasn't the highest-rated game of all time, but it might be the most memorable. From the on-field dramatics, to Lady Gaga's halftime show, to innovative marketing approaches, the NFL's big game delivered on all fronts. Here are the greatest lessons marketers can take away from the Patriots-Falcons showdown. The classic call-to-action still works One of the most memorable commercials of Super Bowl 51 was a spot by 84 Lumber showing a mother and daughter immigrating to the United States. The commercial showed only the beginning portion of the ad and asked viewers to visit the brand's website to see the conclusion. The strategy proved to be so successful that the promoted website crashed from too many visits. Find the sweet spot between humor and strange There was something inherently awkward about watching a woman flirt with a cartoon Mr. Clean in this year's P&G Super Bowl spot. And yet, there was something captivating about it. It's this borderline between strange and humor that led Business Insider to deem this ad Super Bowl 51's most memorable commercial. Hashtag marketing is only getting stronger Sports are always a social experience, and social media analytics provider Netbase estimates that this year's big game hashtags — including #SB, #SB51, and #superbowl2017 — generated about 86 billion impressions. And while the Patriots were the ones to take home the trophy, Airbnb was the big winner when it came to social media, receiving the most overall engagement with its hashtag #WeAccept. According to social analytics platform provider Socialbakers, Airbnb was mentioned 854 times by Twitter users during the big game, and #WeAccept received an average of 25,757 interactions per tweet. Take relevant risks It's no secret that it's a politically divisive time in the U.S., with people ardently for or against President Donald Trump, his new administration, and his policies. Many brands decided to use their Super Bowl 51 ad time as a podium to voice their opinions. The response was not always positive, but it did create impressions. Take Budweiser, for example. The beer company released a commercial called “Born the Hard Way,” which depicted the immigrant beginning of the brand. According to marketing technology company Amobee, Budweiser's digital content engagement increased 606% since the ad first appeared online. Stay social There were 27.6 million Super Bowl tweets and retweets across the globe between the hours of 3:00 P.M. and 11:00 P.M., according to Netbase. And between 3:00 A.M. and 12:00 A.M., Facebook and Instagram engaged a combined 110 million people who generated 400 million interactions, including posts, comments, and reactions. These social audiences provided brands and marketers with a wealth of opportunities to communicate and interact. Loading links....

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Business Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Business Sat, Feb 11, 2017 - Page 10　 Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp World Business Quick Take Agencies MEXICO Central bank hikes rates The central bank said it has raised its benchmark interest rate by a half-point to 6.25 percent in a bid to contain rising inflation. The Bank of Mexico announced the hike from the previous 5.75 percent on Thursday, after the country recorded a 4.7 percent annual inflation rate last month. The bank said its goal is restoring inflation to 3 percent. The peso has fallen dramatically against the US dollar in recent years and particularly since the election of US President Donald Trump. CHEMICALS Elementis to buy US firm British speciality chemicals maker Elementis PLC yesterday said it will buy US-based SummitReheis Inc from an affiliate of private equity firm One Rock Capital Partners LLC for an enterprise value of US$360 million to expand its personal care business. Elementis said the deal would increase the annual sales of its personal care business to US$200 million and boost its adjusted earnings in the current financial year. SummitReheis counts Procter & Gamble Co and Colgate-Palmolive Co among its clients. GREECE Minister urges haste in talks The country needs to wrap up its debt negotiations quickly to avoid the risk of having to deal with a new set of European leaders after looming elections, Alternate Minister of Finance George Chouliarakis said on Thursday. The Netherlands is holding national elections in March, France has a presidential vote in April and Germany is preparing for its federal poll in September. “As they say, better the devil you know,” Chouliarakis told an audience in London. “It is a good reason to conclude the negotiations as quickly as you can.” CHINA Movie quota might be raised The government is likely to raise the quota of imported films allowed into the country, the state-run Global Times newspaper said, a potential fillip for Hollywood producers who are increasingly looking to tap the country’s fast-growing box office. The newspaper, citing experts, predicted that about a dozen films could be added to the annual quota of 34 imported movies, while foreign producers would get closer to the 40 percent of ticket revenues they receive in other overseas markets. That would be up from the current 25 percent. AUTOMAKERS Renault books record year French automaker Renault SA yesterday said it booked a record year last year and added it would not set aside any provisions for potential financial fallout from a diesel emissions probe. Renault said in a statement that profits leapt about 20 percent last year, driven by strong sales. Net profit last year jumped by 19.7 percent to 3.54 billion euros (US$3.77 billion) on a 13.1 percent increase in revenues to 51.2 billion euros, the statement said. PUBLISHING News Corp loses US$290m News Corp, the publishing arm of Rupert Murdoch’s corporate empire, swung to a loss in the last quarter, forced to write down the values of its Australian newspapers. The New York-based company — whose newspaper assets also include the Wall Street Journal and Times of London — reported a loss of US$290 million in the fiscal quarter ending Dec. 31 last year, compared with a profit of US$62 million a year earlier.

(image captured from video) By Tim Baysinger, Reuters Feb 6, 2017 at 8:14 am | Print View NEW YORK — With Americans’ attention more finely tuned to the political climate under U.S. President Donald Trump, brands that dove headfirst into that conversation generated the most reaction from viewers during Sunday’s Super Bowl. For much of the evening, the chatter around commercials by Airbnb Inc, Coca-Cola Co and Budweiser was more exciting than the Super Bowl itself. That changed late in the game, the New England Patriots pulled off a 25-point comeback to defeat the Atlanta Falcons in the National Football League’s first-ever overtime Super Bowl. With the thrilling finish, viewers could exceed the 114.4 million who watched 2015 Super Bowl in 2015, providing a massive audience for advertisers who paid more than $5 million for 30 seconds of airtime. A teaser for the second season of Netflix Inc’s hit show “Stranger Things,” as well as celebrity-studded and humorous ads from T-Mobile US Inc and Procter & Gamble Co’s Mr. Clean, drew the most attention on social media. Still, brands such as Airbnb, that leaned into subjects of diversity and immigration, by and large sparked the most conversation among viewers. The company’s ad, featuring a diverse group of employees touting a message of acceptance, will be seen by many as a criticism of Trump’s immigration policies. Airbnb was one of the last to buy a Super Bowl spot; co-founder Brian Chesky wrote on Twitter they purchased and shot the ad last Thursday. The commercial was among the most discussed by viewers, generating nearly 78,000 tweets between 6:30 p.m. and 11 p.m. EST, data from digital marketing technology company Amobee shows. During the pregame, Coca-Cola re-aired its ad from the 2014 Super Bowl, which featured “America the Beautiful” sung in different languages, which prompted more than 74,000 tweets. Budweiser’s spot, telling the story of Anheuser-Busch’s immigrant co-founder Adolphus Busch, and Pennsylvania-based building materials company 84 Lumber Co’s ad were among the most talked about as well. 84 Lumber’s commercial had to be reworked after Fox rejected an initial version that featured a border wall, which was in the company’s full-length online version. Amobee data found the sentiment for the ads skewed positive. Advertisers have been grappling with how to reach consumers in the political climate under Trump, when viewers’ increasingly partisan attitudes make it more difficult to market to a broad audience. “It’s America paying attention to us and really ranking us, when they so often try to ignore what advertising does,” said Ted Royer, chief creative officer of creative agency Droga5, which created Sprint Corp’s ad targeting rival carrier Verizon Communications Inc. Trump’s November election, and his subsequent action on immigration and other issues has nearly split the population. That divide has left the stakes higher for advertisers devising campaigns for some of the biggest U.S. brands, which typically avoid politics, for fear of upsetting consumers. “There’s a lot more anxiety, self-inflicted anxiety, in the country than there has been ever in the past,” said Mike Sheldon, chairman and chief executive of ad agency Deutsch, who created Busch’s first-ever Super Bowl ad.         Your next Nation & World articles Ford investing $1 billion in start-up New York man accused of bomb plot admits ...

Submit news MediaCom South Africa promotes Ashish Williams to CEO 10 Feb 2017 | Save | Email | Print |  PDF    Issued by: MediaCom Ashish Williams has been named as the new CEO for MediaCom South Africa, replacing Julian Neuburger who is retiring. Ashish and Julian will be working closely together over the next few months to ensure that the transition is as smooth as possible and that the handover doesn't affect the day to day of the agency's client business. Ashish WilliamsAshish joined MediaCom South Africa in 2014 as Strategic Planning Director on P&G, having previously worked in China and India. He has vast experience working in growing economies and assisting advertisers to adapt to the ever-changing landscape of digital transformation. In January 2015, he accepted the position as COO. In this role, he led the implementation of programmatic technology and a new approach to data at MediaCom, creating a lean, streamlined buying team that has added hugely to the agency’s ability to target efficiently and effectively. “Ashish has proved himself to be a successful leader as COO in South Africa, and we are confident that he will lead the team to immense success as CEO,” says Nick Lawson, CEO of MediaCom EMEA. “We will be investing heavily to support MediaCom in this important market and ensuring that all our clients have access to the best tools and insight that we can provide.” In turn, Ashish says, “I’m delighted to be taking on the role of CEO at a time when media advice and expertise have never been more successful for brands. Digital transformation is the critical challenge for brands and MediaCom has never been more prepared to help its clients on that journey.” His appointment follows the decision by Julian Neuburger, who has been interim CEO since April 2014, to retire. Julian has been a tremendously valued leader, working very closely with his team by providing the guidance, strategic approach, and advice necessary to secure accounts such as Coca-Cola SA, Henley & Partners, and Fastjet amongst many others for MediaCom South Africa. During his time as CEO, MediaCom has moved from being the sixth-largest agency in South Africa to number four, with a growth rate of 35% over the past year alone (Source: RECMA). He has also been part of the MediaCom Global Leadership Team for more than two decades. Julian was a key driver of growth, not just in South Africa but globally, handling large regional and global accounts such as Procter & Gamble, Mars, VWG, Coca-Cola and Warner Bros.

Submit news Effectiveness in the Digital Age report indicates renewed focus on reach will drive sales 10 Feb 2017 | Save | Email | Print |  PDF     Warc has released its trend report Effectiveness in the Digital Age, indicating that marketing effectiveness in the digital age requires striking the right balance between close targeting and mass reach. David TiltmanDavid Tiltman, head of content at Warc, says, “The decision by Procter & Gamble last year to cut back on targeted advertising on Facebook has led to an ‘intellectual battle’ with media owners - both traditional and digital - engaged in a race to prove how effective their channels are in driving business outcomes and how best to combine channels. “The big-picture issue is close targeting (particularly via digital channels) versus mass reach - and a number of FMCG brands have concluded that a renewed focus on reach will drive sales growth. With budgets under ongoing pressure, more studies along these lines can be expected in 2017.” “At a time when businesses are talking about ‘digital transformation’, marketers are ideally placed to engage with customers in new ways across emerging touchpoints in a more informed manner,” adds Jason Warnes, digital marketing partner, Deloitte Digital. Key insights 1. Major FMCG advertisers are pulling back from granular targeting: In August, Procter & Gamble’s chief brand officer, Marc Pritchard publically questioned the value of close targeting of audiences on Facebook. In doing so, he cast doubt on one of digital’s key benefits over so-called traditional media - the ability to target more closely - and resurfaced the industry debate on close targeting versus reach. 2. Short-termism weakens links between creativity and effectiveness: Research by marketing consultant Peter Field, based on data from the IPA, a UK ad agency association, and The Gunn Report, a ranking of creative advertising, found that short-termism and pressure on budgets are weakening creative effectiveness. The shift of budget into digital media, where short-term metrics are common, has exacerbated this shift. In short, the impact of highly creative work has halved since 2011 because of these forces. 3. However, digital platforms are making TV more effective: A further study by Peter Field and Les Binet of adam&eveDDB suggests that digital platforms can be used to make so-called ‘traditional’ media more powerful than they used to be. They do so in two ways. They provide additional reach for video content by, for example, combining TV with online video. They also provide a wide range of activation channels that can complement the long-term brand-building efforts of other channels. 4. Digital has a ‘reach ceiling’ and is most effective supporting TV: Research by Nielsen confirms that TV remains the biggest single driver of reach, ahead of digital platforms. Brands currently investing in TV who want to maintain reach are advised not to go digital-only; doing so may mean they hit a ‘reach-ceiling’. However, digital does add an average incremental reach to a TV campaign of 4.4%. The research also suggested that mobile is now performing on a par with or better than desktop at delivering impressions to an intended audience. 5. Mainstream channels are fighting back in the effectiveness ‘arms race’: Industry bodies representing several mainstream media channels have released a number of in-depth studies supporting the effectiveness credentials of those channels. For example, a UK report on radio, by trade body Radiocentre, claimed that the channel delivered a 7:1 return on investment and that one of the key benefits of radio is its ability to extend the reach of brand campaigns. Separate research by trade body Newsworks concluded that advertising in newspapers makes TV twice as effective and online display four times as effective. 6. Social sites are starting to focus on business outcomes: Facebook has openly criticised some of the measures marketers are using on the social site (and, by extension, other social platforms). It is focusing on research that links advertising exposure on Facebook to sales increases.Effectiveness in the Digital Age is one of six key trends featured in Warc’s Toolkit 2017. The annual report, produced in association with Deloitte Digital, brings together the best of Warc’s content over the past year - the latest ideas, research and examples. A Warc webinar on Effectiveness in the Digital Age will take place on Wednesday 22 February. Attendees may register here to listen.

Photograph: Alamy Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close Julia Kollewe Friday 10 February 2017 13.08 EST First published on Friday 10 February 2017 04.57 EST Reckitt Benckiser, the company behind Nurofen, Dettol and Durex, is moving into baby food with the $16.6bn (£13.3bn) acquisition of a US infant formula maker, its biggest deal to date. Mead Johnson Nutrition manufactures Enfa formula, which it says is the main infant nutrition brand in the world and will become the combined group’s biggest “powerbrand”, with sales of $3.7bn a year. The company also produces Choco Milk, Lactum and other milk-based products for children. Reckitt’s top brands at present are Durex condoms, Mucinex cough remedy and Dettol and Lysol cleaners. Adding baby food to its vast portfolio of household products will raise the company’s standing among consumer multinationals Unilever, Nestlé, Danone and Procter & Gamble. Mead is the third-largest baby food company in the world, after Nestlé and Danone, according to market research company Euromonitor International. The global baby food market is forecast to grow by between 7.4% and 8.5% annually in the coming years. Reckitt’s chief executive, Rakesh Kapoor, hailed the acquisition as a “significant step” forward for the company. “This deal will in one move almost double our consumer health business. This is about trusted relationships with the medical community. Maybe this company [Mead] is not very well known in the UK investor base, but it fits our definition of consumer health,” he said. Kapoor said the acquisition would strengthen Reckitt’s presence in developing markets, particularly China. These will make up 40% of the combined group’s sales, with China the second-largest market after the US. Five years ago, China was not in Reckitt’s top 10 markets, he said. The deal is estimated to bring £200m in annual cost savings. The two companies have not discussed job losses yet, Kapoor said, but employees in the UK will not be affected, as Mead only has a small business in the country. It generates half of its sales in Asia, one-third in North America and Europe (mostly in the US), and 17% in Latin America. Mead employs 7,600 people globally, while Reckitt has a workforce of 37,000. The regular Enfa infant formula is not on sale in the UK, but some specialist Enfa products are. Kapoor said it was too early to say whether Enfa would be sold more widely in the UK after the takeover. But Reckitt noted that it had made a success of taking on localised brands and rolling them out across the world. Lianne van den Bos, a senior analyst at Euromonitor, said: “Reckitt Benckiser’s takeover bid of Mead Johnson is one that surprised us all as it signifies little overlap with their current business, but it hints at future growth strategies for the consumer packaged goods industry. “Health nutrition is the way forward and marks many companies’ changing direction for growth, the latest examples being Danone and Nestlé. “Reckitt Benckiser’s plunge in[to] a market [China] set to drive half of future global baby food growth could well pay off in the long run.” Reckitt is paying $90 per share in cash. Including Mead’s debt, the value of the deal is $17.9bn. The takeover needs to be approved by shareholders and regulators. Facebook Twitter Pinterest The top 10 companies in the baby food market. Photograph: Euromonitor International The company, founded in 1905 by Edward Mead Johnson, later passed into the ownership of US drugmaker Bristol-Myers Squibb and floated on the stock market when it was spun off eight years ago. The acquisition comes after a tough year for Reckitt that saw slowing sales, a toxic disinfectant scandal in South Korea and a fine in Australia, as well as shareholder anger over Kapoor’s £23m pay package. Several South Korean retailers dropped Reckitt’s products after a humidifier steriliser made by the company caused deadly lung problems. Kapoor issued a personal apology at the company’s annual meeting in May. In Australia, Reckitt was fined AUS$1.7m (£1m) for making misleading claims about its Nurofen painkillers. Mead faces a lawsuit from a whistleblower (paywall), a former employee alleging that she was unfairly dismissed after raising safety issues over bottles of infant formula.

This infographic shows how only 10 companies own nearly all the world’s food brands (PHOTO) Feb, 10 2017 Author: newsroom Is this free market? Related Eight billionaires richer that half of the world’s poorest people Just when you think there’s no end to the diversity of junk food lining supermarket aisles, an insanely detailed infographic comes along to set us all straight. Out of the hundreds of products at our disposal, only ten major corporations manufacture the bulk of what we toss in our shopping carts. So whether you’re looking to stock up on anything from orange soda to latte-flavored potato chips, Mondelez, Kraft, Coca-Cola, Nestlé, PepsiCo, P&G, Johnson & Johnson, Mars, Danone, General Mills, Kellogg’s, and Unilever own just about everything you could hope to buy. It seems that six degrees of separation theory has been proven after all, if only because we all drink Diet Coke every now and then. In order to visually elucidate that point, Oxfam International created a comprehensive infographic that reveals the extensive reach of the “Big 10” food and beverage companies. Unlikely ties between brands we largely don’t associate with one another show how easy it is to be misinformed about the American food system. For example, PepsiCo produces Quaker granola bars, and Nestlé makes Kit Kat bars but also frozen California Pizza Kitchen pies. To the surprise of many, Pineapple Fanta isn’t sourced straight from the mythical Fanta Islands, but canned right alongside Barq’s root beer at the Coca-Cola factory. Obviously, the horrors extend far beyond our own shattered daydreams. Massive corporations squash entrepreneurial diversity and make it nearly impossible for startups and small businesses to compete. According to Oxfam’s report, “The world’s largest food and beverage companies have a lot of power – but you have more. And because they’re not using theirs enough to help poor communities or the planet, you can use yours to change the way they do business.” If you’re looking to avoid contributing to the Big 10 world takeover, try shopping at local farmers’ markets and maybe skip out on soda and highly processed foods altogether. Your body will thank you for it in the long run anyway.   (Click to enlarge)   Source Tags With: capitalismcompaniesfood brands ← What the f…reeze: MIT researchers create nano-ice at scorching temperatures!

A total of four Grand Prix and 12 Special Awards were presented last night at an event in London hosted by MEC. A campaign for M&Ms' 75th Anniversary took the Grand Prix for Effective Use of Partnerships as well as the Special Award for Collaboration with An Influencer. The initiative used digital partnerships to reinvent the brand's iconic Candyman song, helping it to engage millennials and reverse a sales decline. "The results were stellar," observed Anna Watkins, partner at MoFilm and one of the judges. BBDO NY and MediaCom also won the Grand Prix for Effective Channel Integration with its Snickers: Crisper campaign. It increased both purchase intent and sales in the US by leveraging a popular cultural trend and creating a new lexicon across multiple touchpoints. "I liked the thinking behind it and they found the right way for each channel," said judge Dominique Touchaud, global brand strategist at Procter & Gamble. In the Best Use of Data category, Affinity took the Grand Prix and the Special Award for Data-Driven Insight for its Narellan Pools campaign Diving Into Data. Chair of the judging panel, Sital Banerjee, Global Head of Media, Philips, commented on the campaign: "They turned things around with a declining budget and were able to leverage data. That stood out for me." The Grand Prix for Effective Use of Tech was awarded to Leo Burnett Melbourne's Reword campaign for the Australian mental health foundation Headspace. The organisation helped to reduce instances of online bullying by young internet users through the introduction of an online tool that encourages people to reconsider what they've written before posting. James Lewin, Head of Innovation, Mindshare APAC, and a judge for this category, said: "It is a brilliant piece of tech and the results speak for themselves." Also in the Tech category, Old Spice's Nature Adventure from Wieden+Kennedy, a gaming-led campaign in the US and Canada on live-streaming platform Twitch, took the Special Early Adopter Award. Kraft Heinz's Serving What's Trending campaign through Starcom, took the Real Time Special Award. UK insurance brand Aviva won two special awards: one in the tech category for Programmatic with its Data Storytelling campaign, and the Consumer's Friend award in the Best Use of Data category for its Safer Driving Challenge. The final special award winner in the data category was KeyBank's Hassle-Free Account, through Compass Point/McCann in the US, for Attribution. The US Army and Independence Day won the Special Award in Partnerships & Sponsorships for Successful Sponsorship, while Under Armour's Game Changer campaign, through Optimum Sports and Droga5, took the Special Award for Effective Native Content. In the Effective Channel Integration category, LEGO's Make LEGO the Star of Christmas campaign, through UM Australia, netted the Cross-Channel Special Award, while Project Akshar for SmartLife, through FP7/DXB, won the Low Budget Special Award. The final special award for paid, owned and earned media was awarded to Almap BBDO's Antarctica Beer campaign, The World's Best Social Network.

According to a person familiar with the party’s strategy, BJP has spent close to Rs150 crore on advertising for the ongoing state elections with an aggressive campaign across TV, print, radio and outdoor. A majority of the spends are being directed towards Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand, said the person, on condition of anonymity. Besides television, the ruling party is also using movie theaters in these areas for its campaign. The party, in its advertisements and manifesto has made a pitch for development and meeting people’s aspirations through empowerment. It is promoting its anti-corruption narrative, expansion of social sector schemes as well as education and employment. According to a person who has worked with the BJP’s media research team, issues of good governance and women’s safety are also being highlighted. “We are taking up issues prevalent in the country and how the party has tried to resolve these. We are trying to communicate our schemes actively through all interactive mediums, be it social media, television, print or electronic media. We are trying to reach as many people as possible,” said Gopal Krishna Agarwal, a BJP spokesperson.

Advertising firm Ogilvy & Mather which worked with BJP on its campaigns for the general elections as well as the state elections of Maharashtra and Haryana continues to work for the party. The agency’s executive chairman and creative director (South Asia) Piyush Pandey declined to share details.

Uttar Pradesh will go through a seven-phase voting between 11 February and 8 March. Manipur will have elections in two phases on 4 and 8 March. A single phase election for Uttarakhand is scheduled for 15 February. BJP is currently in power in Goa and in an alliance with the Shiromani Akali Dal in Punjab; the Congress is in power in Uttarakhand and Manipur; and the Samajwadi Party rules Uttar Pradesh. Assembly polls are also due in Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh in the second half of the year.

Roughly Speaking: Celebrating the cuisine of the seven banned nations News Maryland Howard County Howard Magazine Ellicott City start-up 'rethinks' bottled water Rethink Water Jen Rynda / Baltimore Sun Media Group Matthew Swanson, co-founder and CEO of Rethink Water, and Chris Donovan, co-founder and head of sales, pose for a photo at their office in Ellicott City.

(Jen Rynda / Baltimore Sun Media Group) Allison EatoughFor Howard Magazine These 30-year-olds are aiming to change the way we consume water. The first time Matt Swanson and Chris O’Donovan, both 30, dipped their toes into entrepreneurship, they failed. In 2010, the founders of Ellicott City-based Rethink Water envisioned creating a flavorless, vitamin-enhanced, no-calorie water. They spent six months researching the concept and developing a business plan. But after sharing the idea with a flavor developer, they discovered that the beverage would quickly spoil and have a short shelf life. So they went back to the drawing board. For several years, they researched water quality, packaging and demand. “We kept seeing how plastic was so bad for the environment,” says Swanson, who grew up in Highland. To reduce packaged water’s environmental impact, Swanson and O’Donovan designed a recyclable container using 70 percent paperboard, a renewable resource, and filled it with highly filtered water. Rethink Water, named to reflect Swanson and O’Donovan’s drive to reimagine the packaged water industry, was born in October 2015. Rethink Water Jen Rynda / Baltimore Sun Media Group Rethink Water is sold in more than 2,000 Mid-Atlantic stores. Rethink Water is sold in more than 2,000 Mid-Atlantic stores. (Jen Rynda / Baltimore Sun Media Group) “We’re all about building an incredibly successful company that creates needed change,” O’Donovan says. Unlike Rethink’s packaging, most plastic water bottles are produced from crude oil, a nonrenewable resource. And while plastic bottles are recyclable, Americans still throw away 2.5 million of them every hour, according to Recycle Across America. Swanson and O’Donovan met as students at Washington College in Chestertown. After graduating in 2009, they went their separate ways to build their careers, both in sales — Swanson, who splits his time between Michigan and Maryland, at Procter & Gamble and then Google, and O’Donovan, a Chevy Chase resident, for Body Armor sports drink and then Tessemae’s All Natural, a Maryland-based condiment maker.

When it came time to cast their ballots in the 2016 Best of Howard readers’ poll, more than 15,000 voters chimed in. Voting opened just days after a historic flood wiped out many of the businesses on Ellicott City’s Main Street, but that didn’t...Read the story In their spare time, they built and raised $500,000 for Rethink. Among the early investors: Ken Ulman, former Howard County executive, and Gary Rezeppa, a Glenwood resident and former executive with Vitamin Water. Both founders eventually quit their jobs to focus on Rethink full time. “There’s entrepreneurs and wantrepreneurs,” says O’Donovan, who sold cases of Rethink Water out of his car. “You have to go all in, or it’s not going to work.” The concept seems to be working so far. Rethink has reached $500,000 in sales and can be found in more than 2,000 Mid-Atlantic stores, including Giant, Wegmans and Target. This year, with distributor partners on both coasts, plans to double their staff and a line of children’s flavored water due out this spring, Swanson and O’Donovan are projecting $5 million in sales. George Boarman, manager of Boarman’s Old Fashioned Meat Market in Highland, was one of the first to sell the Rethink Water soon after it launched. “I thought it was a fantastic idea,” Boarman says. “I believed in the product more than anything.” The price, at $1.49 for a 16.9-ounce carton and $1.99 for a liter, is close to other, less environmentally friendly packaged waters, he says, and customers like the local connection. “It’s quickly becoming a brand people recognize,” he says. “I think it’s something that’s going to change the dynamic across the board for water.” That’s what Swanson and O’Donovan are hoping for.

About Us Archives Advertise Technique Search for: Home Search for: Home News Opinions Consensus Opinion Letters to the Editor Political Cartoon Life Entertainment Sports Time Out Blogs Technocrats The Rambler Advertising Provocative Mr. Clean commercial shakes up Superbowl By Maura Currie on February 10, 2017 Leave a reply Photo courtesy of Procter & Gamble; Design by Rushika Pandya Tweet Americans tuning into Super Bowl LI for an evening of good football, bombastic halftime entertainment and subversive advertisement were treated to all three. Though controversy was somewhat expected given the politically-charged nature of the American zeitgeist and the fashionability of making liberal, anti-Trump stands as a marketing method, one commercial stood alone in ruffling some feathers: Mr. Clean. Mr. Clean burst onto the advertising scene in 1958, initially played by a live actor but transitioning to a burly two-dimensional man with a single earring and a comically large torso narrowing to a lithe waist. He was typically depicted in this incarnation as a domestic god of sorts, ringing the doorbell when an individual was distressed by the amount of household cleaning he needed accomplished. Sometimes it is a married couple in which the wife is an expert testifying to the power of Mr. Clean’s cleaning prowess; other times, it is a single woman, living in a suspiciously filthy home. Is she truly alone? Does she live with roommates? Is she a housewife, lounging and lamenting while her husband and pack of children are away for the day? It is a mystery, but Mr. Clean does not seem to care. He is there to help, to soothe the pain of washing the floors and the clothes and the windows by simply accomplishing it all himself. “You can wash the dog, laundry too! Mr. Clean, I love you,” croons one such woman in a 1958 advertisement. Mr. Clean does not seem to reciprocate her romantic advances but instead departs when his job is done. Everyone is happy. The Mr. Clean of 2017 appears to have a more perverse agenda. In his Super Bowl spot, which Elle Magazine is calling “brilliant” and “sexy,” Mr. Clean arrives to the home of a lone woman lamenting a stove stain and begins both cleaning up and getting dirty. First his groin is visible in a shot that pans up to his still-bald and still-earring adorned face quickly, but not quickly enough. He wrings out a sponge — ostensibly his titular Magic Eraser — in one large hand, sending a gush of liquid to the ground. He stands intimately close to the woman before whirling around in a bizarre and yet hygienic mating dance; he gyrates to the rhythm of the mop firmly stroking the floor from his hands. Whereas Mr. Clean is animated to be almost lifelike save for the cartoonish glint in his eye, the woman is a live-action, definitely real human being. It is unclear how much money Proctor and Gamble spent animating all thirty seconds of the ad or if they used motion capture. One has to wonder how and if the tone would change should Mr. Clean have been replaced by a real human — animation seems to lend an aura of innocence and harmlessness to the commercial’s premise. If Mr. Clean were a real man, ripped in all capacities and obviously older judging by the white brows, entering a woman’s home and swaying his hips, would this commercial even have aired? Would the sexuality have become overt to the point of being inappropriate for young eyes? The sexualization of Mr. Clean ends up being comical when it is revealed that he is nothing more than a specter, imagined by the woman to represent her decidedly un-sexy husband who is trying to clean. Herein lies the secret to the runaway success of this advertisement, the origin of the memes and hundreds of middle-aged women swooning on Facebook, that yes, this definitely was the best Super Bowl commercial this year. As far as advertising executives can tell, women are so exhausted by the notion of housework and cleaning that the thought of not doing those things is arousing. The sheer value of not being confined to gendered conceptions of housekeeping is an aphrodisiac, liberating and exciting and bolstering to the ego. In fact, this sensual reincarnation of a classic cleaning product persona may have been foreshadowed by Mr. Clean winning one of People Magazine’s Sexiest Men Alive in 1998. Even 20 years ago, women found his cleanliness attractive. Women have better things to do than mop and scrub the stove, and being trapped in the predicament of choosing between the two spheres has been present since and before the 1950s. A man who offers to take away such menial tasks, foregoing whatever manly work he has to do, might as well be built like Idris Elba and have the moves of Patrick Swazye in “Dirty Dancing.” Get you a man who can do both, as one might say in internet parlance. This Super Bowl was rife with high-budget advertisements competing to make the sneakiest political statement. 84 Lumber, for example, aired a short of a mother and daughter’s immigration journey from Mexico to the U.S., and their website soon crashed. But among the drama of politically charged commercials and the spectacle of Lady Gaga’s half time show was one commercial with no agenda but to be provocative and silly. Similar in a way to the “Fifty Shades of Grey” phenomenon, Sexy Mr. Clean borders on ridiculous pandering but is just self-aware enough to be interesting. Maybe his antics will boost bleach and Magic Eraser sales, or perhaps his new image will damage sales irrevocably because no one can bear to look Mr. Clean in the eyes. Regardless of the financial effect on the Procter & Gamble Company, an impact was made that still ripples through the streams of the internet almost a week later.

Photo: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg News By Mike Shields Mike Shields The Wall Street Journal BiographyMike Shields @digitalshields mike.shields@wsj.com Updated Feb. 10, 2017 9:17 a.m. ET 3 COMMENTS Facebook has pledged to undergo audits by the media industry’s measurement watchdog, the Media Rating Council, people familiar with the matter say, a move that will likely please ad-industry executives who are skeptical of the tech giant’s data-reporting practices. Ad executives have been clamoring for more independent verification of Facebook’s metrics, especially after a series of disclosures by the company in recent months about mistakes in its data. Representatives from Facebook, including Carolyn Everson, the company’s vice president of global marketing solutions, delivered a presentation Thursday in Washington, D.C. to the board of the Association of National Advertisers, a trade group for marketers, the people familiar with the matter say. Ms. Everson informed the group that Facebook plans to provide more granular data to third-party measurement partners such as Integral Ad Science and Moat. That will include metrics such as how many ads in a given campaign are viewable, how long these ads appear on various screens and whether sound was on for video ads. Related The Most Powerful Player in Media You’ve Never Heard Of A Primer on the Facebook Measurement Wars Facebook Overestimated Key Video Metric for Two Years That could mean that more Facebook data will be vetted by independent third parties, which advertisers can then use when evaluating media buys on the platform. In addition, Ms. Everson pledged that Facebook will undergo MRC-administered audits to help marketers feel that Facebook is more accountable, the people familiar with the matter said. The MRC, the media industry body that certifies measurement methods, declined to comment. Representatives from ANA couldn't be reached for comment. Facebook has been under fire of late for a series of embarrassing data mishaps. And advertisers have generally been frustrated by their belief that Facebook and other big digital platforms do the equivalent of grading their own homework, while not allowing for genuine third-party inspection of their data. Marc Pritchard, chief brand officer for Procter & Gamble, who has called for more transparent measurement practices by big tech companies, attended the ANA session and was pleased with Facebook’s pledge. “Facebook’s actions on media transparency are a positive step forward, particularly coming from one of the largest media players in the industry,” he said in a statement. He said he hopes Facebook’s move “builds more momentum to create a clean and productive digital media supply chain.” During the meeting, Ms. Everson also laid out a number of new ad-buying options requested by advertisers, including the ability for brands to pay only for video ads that run to completion. But she also laid out some of the downsides of such tactics. For example, buying ads based on how long they are viewed can lead to reaching older users who scroll slowly through their newsfeeds and can drive up ad costs, she told marketers.

The Herald-Mail via AP Kevin G. Gilbert 1 of 4 i By DAVID DISHNEAU Associated Press LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story HANCOCK, Md. Environmental activists crowded a TransCanada open house Thursday in western Maryland, blocking access to displays about the company's proposed pipeline beneath the Potomac River to carry natural gas from Pennsylvania to West Virginia. Protest leaders pledged a sustained campaign against the project, planned by the same Canadian energy company behind the disputed Keystone XL oil pipeline. Russell Mokhiber of Berkeley Springs, West Virginia, told the peaceful protesters they can defeat the Eastern Panhandle Expansion Project by making their concerns about potential leaks known to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission once TransCanada files its application in March. "We're going to defeat this pipeline and move on to a better world with solar energy," Mokhiber said after leading scores of demonstrators in singing, "Down to the River to Pray," in the community room of the Hancock Town Hall. TransCanada spokesman Scott Castleman said it was unfortunate that people curious about the project had difficulty reaching company executives stationed at seven tables around the room. He said the pipeline, 72 feet below the river bed, would support growth in the region by increasing a gas supply that is nearing capacity due partly to a Procter & Gamble manufacturing plant under construction near Tabler Station, West Virginia. "We're looking to have conversations with people in the community who want questions answered by our experts," Castleman said. The 3.4-mile project would connect a TransCanada pipeline in Pennsylvania to a Mountaineer Gas line in West Virginia by late 2018. Opponents say a gas leak could taint local aquifers and the Potomac, a drinking-water source for downstream communities including Washington, D.C. The project will require permits from the state of Maryland, which owns the Potomac, and the National Park Service since the pipeline also would run beneath the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park. The canal parallels the river for nearly 185 miles from Washington to Cumberland. The line would cross the river near Hancock, a town of about 1,500 about 120 miles upstream from Washington. The Keystone XL project would extend from Canada's tar sands through Montana, South Dakota and Nebraska, where it would connect with the existing Keystone pipeline route to carry crude oil to specialized refineries along the Texas Gulf Coast. The Obama administration rejected the company's State Department permit application, citing climate-change concerns, but President Donald Trump has invited TransCanada to reapply.

Feb 10, 2017 Ads for the likes of Mercedes-Benz, Waitrose and Marie Curie are raising money for extremist groups, says report whatsapp facebook twitter google+ linkedin email Ethan Miller/Getty Images Some of the world's biggest brands, companies and charities could be inadvertently funding terror groups from their advertising budgets. Analysis by The Times of online extremist content suggests blacklists designed to prevent digital adverts from appearing next to certain content are not working. See related  Fake news: Seven bizarre stories that went viral Promotions for hundreds of large companies, universities and charities, including Mercedes-Benz, Waitrose and Marie Curie, appear "on hate sites and beside YouTube videos created by supporters of terrorist groups such as Islamic State and Combat 18, a violent pro-Nazi faction", says the paper. It adds that the practice "is likely to generate tens of thousands of dollars a month for extremists". It's not just terrorism, neither: the paper has found advertising similarly placed against online pornography, as well as taxpayer and publicly funded bodies advertising on fake news websites. An ad next to a YouTube video "typically earns whoever posted the video $7.60 (£6) for every 1,000 views". Some of the most popular extremist videos "have more than one million hits". Which brands are involved? The Times highlights an advert by car firm ­Mercedes which appeared on a pro-IS video on YouTube and was viewed 115,000 times. Sandals Resorts, the luxury holiday operator, is advertised next to a video promoting al-Shabaab, the East African jihadist group affiliated to al-Qaeda, while adverts for Honda, Halifax, the Victoria & Albert Museum, Liverpool University, Argos, Churchill Retirement, Waitrose, Lloyds Bank, John Lewis, Disney and Marie Curie, among others, appear against a range of websites linked to Islamic extremists and far-right groups. Commercials for government-funded programmes such as the International Citizen Service, which is paid for out of the foreign aid budget, and publicly funded bodies including Save The Children, the National Theatre and Liverpool University appear next to fake content, adds the paper. Why are the brands advertising on the sites? It's not deliberate. Companies, mostly through large agencies, are buying increasing numbers of online advertising each year, some of which is purchased through systems run by Google, among others. Such advertising is placed "programmatically", which means it is automatically assigned by algorithms "in the milliseconds" it takes a page to load based on things such as the browsing history of the person viewing the page. Many agencies' programmatic divisions "apply mark-ups to digital commercials without the brands’ knowledge" and a portion of the money paid can end up in the pockets of the owners of the content. Blacklists are meant to stop adverts from appearing against certain content, while the likes of YouTube are supposed to police content and take down inappropriate material. @thetimes investigation: How big brands fund terror #infographic pic.twitter.com/rPVSZKj0Au — Matt Swift (@m_r_swift) February 9, 2017 What has been the reaction? Mostly, the brands insist they have had no awareness of adverts appearing on these sites and have hit out at the companies managing the process, including the agencies and Google, which owns YouTube. Marc Pritchard, chief brand officer at Procter & Gamble, the world’s biggest advertiser, warned last week: "We have a media supply chain which is murky at best and fraudulent at worst. We need to clean it up." Last night, MPs called on Google to explain why extremists were making money from advertising on YouTube. Labour's Chuka Umunna, a member of the home affairs select committee, said: "This is deeply disturbing. There is no doubt the social media companies could be doing far more to prevent the spread of extremist content." A Google spokesperson said: "When it comes to content on YouTube, we remove flagged videos that break our rules and have a zero tolerance policy for content that incites violence or hatred."
