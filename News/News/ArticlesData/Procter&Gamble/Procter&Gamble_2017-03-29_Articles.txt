Saatchi & Saatchi Synergize 29 Mar 2017 | Save | Email | Print |  PDF     By: Leigh Andrews Local digirati shone at the recent IAB Bookmark Awards 2017. Here's some feedback from Saatchi & Saatchi Synergize paid media director Adam Mitchell. Saatchi Synergize walked away with paid search marketing craft silver for clients ADT, P&G and Toyota as well as a paid search marketing bronze pixel for the Toyota vehicle range’s ‘Driving media efficiency’. That’s why the team sent through the above GIF of Homer Simpson doing the happy dance on the spot to show how they’re currently feeling. The Saatchi Synergize paid search team on stage at the Bookmarks 2017 Adam Mitchell, paid media director, says: “The Saatchi & Saatchi Synergize paid media team has an ethos of quality over quantity. We are a tight-knit team of specialists who feel the overall calibre of digital work is getting better and better each year in terms of creativity, innovation, technology and data usage, as well as adding real value to consumers and businesses. We are extremely pleased with our two paid search wins – a category bronze for Toyota and a craft silver for ADT, P&G and Toyota.” Trumpeting entry testimonials Mitchell also sent through testimonies from their entries that speak of their specific paid search work results: P&G: “Saatchi Synergize have been a partner for over three years and in that time have transformed the way P&G think about search and content marketing globally. The results have been nothing short of spectacular, reducing spend by 45% in paid search whilst driving double the amount of traffic to key touch points by increasing organic visibility and increasing engagement scores across all content. Synergize has since been recognised by our client as best in class globally and the work has also been recognised by independent third party reviewers, reaching the highest accolade of ‘genius in category’. They continue to exceed expectations around the world.” – John Kinder, global digital director at Saatchi & Saatchi Worldwide. Toyota: “Our agency initially partnered with Synergize so they could conduct a performance audit on our existing work, and from there grew into a full account restructure. From the start, our partnership with Synergize has delivered immediate and ongoing value, netting tangible efficiencies and allowing Toyota’s closely managed paid search budget to deliver an even better ROI. The team at Synergize is staffed with true SEM subject matter experts, each able to identify not only opportunities for improvement, but also actionable solutions.” – Conrad Nussbaum, group director and general manager of business and analytics at Saatchi & Saatchi LA.

ADT: “In a market where we are facing severe competitive pressure, there is a strong need to constantly increase our customer lead volumes. Saatchi & Saatchi Synergize helped us maximise quality lead generation, keeping our sales call centre busy, by managing our paid search campaigns with high attention to detail in a complex environment. They regularly provided recommendations from learnings to increase campaign performance and leads, covering everything from keyword suggestions right through to unique landing pages per product. Synergize helped us to maintain our market share over the past year which is a great achievement for a market leader.” – Simon Morgan, national marketing manager at ADT Security.

Folorunso Alakija These was the assertion of Mrs Alakija, who was the keynote speaker at the launch of  the campaign dubbed,  “#WeSeeEqual,” to advocate for gender equality in commemoration of the International Women’s Day, IWD,   in Lagos. She  said that there is evidence that women can be agents of economic change According to her, “the world economy is now in such a way that the men cannot do it on their own, we need bold women to step it up and take their rightful place.” “As women, we have to take the bull by the horn and make the change happen by ourselves. As women, you need to go out there and fight for what you need to get and get where you want to be.” She went further to say also that Women need to be giving the opportunities to tap into their talents, and energy is being wasted on a daily basis.” On her part, Group Manager for Design and Financial Analysis EMEA Oral Care at P&G, Bukki Agbeniga P&G has been championing the cause of gender equality both inside and outside of the company, leveraging the strengths of their business and operations, and using their scale and advertising voice to address gender bias and enabling education for girls and women’s economic empowerment, said This ultimately led to a partnership with the International Women’s Society, IWS  Nigeria to sponsor the IWS breakfast forum. In addition to their sponsorship of the IWS breakfast, P&G also sponsored WeConnect’s W.I.N Exhibition and Conference .   Okogba View all posts by Okogba → Previous Post Foundation repairs 35 women with VVF Disclaimer Comments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.

Priyanka Mittal Damages of over Rs 2 crore have been sought by P&G in its original suit against HUL for allegedly ‘tarnishing its goodwill and reputation’. Photo: Bloomberg New Delhi: Leading fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) company, Proctor & Gamble, on Wednesday moved the Delhi high court in appeal against an order dismissing its plea over alleged disparaging shampoo advertisements being aired by its competitor, Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL). The brands in question are HUL’s Clinic Plus shampoo and P&G’s Head & Shoulders shampoo. The matter was brought before a bench headed by Justice Pradeep Nandrajog who refused to pass any order and said that the matter would be taken up on a later date. On 17 February, Justice Rajiv Sahai Endlaw had dismissed three suits by the FMCG majors, HUL and P&G, who had approached the court seeking to stop the other from airing their shampoo advertisements, alleging that these advertisements are “hurting their reputation and goodwill”. The court had also refused to consider posting the matter for trial and held that the nature of the suits did not merit trial. Both the companies had filed suits against each other and claimed that the other’s ads were disparaging its brand. The matter did not end there as HUL took the shampoo advertisement battle ahead through a cross-suit against P&G. This was based on a total of seven advertisements being aired by P&G since April, which compare Clinic Plus’s shampoo sachet with Head & Shoulders and say that the latter was more effective on dandruff. Another cross-suit was subsequently filed by P&G. Damages of over Rs 2 crore have been sought by P&G in its original suit against HUL for allegedly ‘tarnishing its goodwill and reputation’. HUL stated in its suit that the company had a copyright over the Rs1 sachet of Clinic Plus shampoo. The comparison sought to be made was deemed to be one of “comparing apples with oranges”, HUL had submitted while arguing before the single judge. The petitioner added that it would encourage unfair competition because Clinic Plus is a non-anti dandruff shampoo and never claimed to remove dandruff, unlike Head & Shoulders, which has always pitched itself as an anti-dandruff specialist. The matter will be heard next on Friday.

Chris Hill (TMFWizard) Mar 29, 2017 at 10:58PM In this podcast, the Market Foolery team turns its attention to the latest controversy at YouTube as major advertisers have complained about their ads appearing next to objectionable videos. As the online advertising race between Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) intensifies, the internet giant has no choice but to address the issue quickly. To wrap up the show, the team also answers a listener question for Canadian investors before discussing the state of March Madness. A full transcript follows the video. This video was recorded on March 27, 2017. Chris Hill: It's Monday, March 27th. Welcome to Market Foolery. I'm Chris Hill. Joining me in studio today, from Million Dollar Portfolio, Jason Moser; and from Stock Advisor Canada, Taylor Muckerman. Happy Monday! Jason Moser: Hey, now! Taylor Muckerman: We're doing it! Hill: We are doing it. Welcome back! You've been busy. Muckerman: Yeah, a couple weeks. You were at South by Southwest. We've been overlapping each other. Hill: There we go. It's good to have you back in the studio. Muckerman: It's good to be back. Hill: We're going to dip into the Fool mailbag. We have to start with a story that's been brewing for a little while. I'll be honest. This is a story, I saw a headline on this a week or two ago, and it registered like, huh, that's interesting, and it continues to balloon. This is the fact that a week ago, Google formally apologized for running customer's ads alongside objectionable videos. We've talked before about YouTube and how important it is in the world of search, and how it's one of the most popular places to search. And you see these stories about, if YouTube was a stand-alone company, it'd be worth somewhere in the neighborhood of $75 billion. Google makes this apology a week ago, and here we are a week later, and I guess, among other things, Jason, probably a reminder that YouTube is a really big place with lots of videos, and therefore it's hard even for the owners to monitor it. The Wall Street Journal had this big story about how Coca-Cola, Microsoft, Amazon, Procter & Gamble, these mainstream brands, are still seeing their ads alongside videos with racist content, anti-Semitic, all of this stuff where the advertisers, rightfully so, say, "I don't want my ads next to that." Moser: Yeah. We're going to hit a point here, sooner or later, it's going to be like you do with your kids, they can say sorry only so many times before you're like, "I get that you're sorry. Just don't do it again. I'm not looking for sorry anymore." So, I think with Google and YouTube, this is obviously something that's a big deal. It's not something that immediately impacts their bottom line. When we talk about the bread and butter for Google's money-making machine, it's search advertising. But, there's a good percentage, close to 20% of that money, comes through advertising with third-party customers. So, when ads go next to objectionable content, of course, those parties are going to express concern, they want to know what's going on, why is this happening, and what are you going to do to make it stop? Because there is no middle ground here. It's just, flat-out, "This is unacceptable, don't let it happen anymore." This is sort of one of those things with this age of automation, as we go more toward automating everything, particularly on the consumer-facing side, I think it's really difficult to ever fall back on the old, "Well, the algorithm did it, it wasn't our fault." Because, ultimately, someone built the algorithm.  I think what Google needs to figure out here is, what is happening to make this happen, and how do they fix it? And whether it is through technology, whether it's through humanizing it a little bit more, and actually bringing on more people to add a human touch to these customer relationships, they need to do something with this before this gets out of hand. We've talked about this a lot, especially in MDP, we own shares of Alphabet, and we own shares of Facebook: We own a far larger position in Facebook, and part of the reason for that is, when you look at the direction things are headed in social, and in internet behavior, there's no question that Facebook is becoming a place, not just Facebook, but its properties, whether it's WhatsApp or Instagram or whatever properties they buy in the future, that's a place where eyeballs go to hang out for a while. Google is more utilitarian in nature, right? You need some information, you find it on Google, and you go to your next place. Facebook is catching up very quickly. They've expressed some concerns that perhaps the last decade was the Google decade, and perhaps this next decade is the Facebook decade. If that is the case, and the numbers certainly point toward that, the argument could at least be made there, Google has got to figure out something yesterday as to how to address this and fix it, because blaming it on the technology is not going to fly. Muckerman: I'm pretty confident that they're going to figure out a way to fix it. Especially when you're talking about Facebook, they had the whole issue around the election with fake news on their site. And you had a group of college kids come out and make an algorithm that was able to identify fake news on the site, and they've been able -- not using their algorithm, but, Facebook has been able to address that. I'm confident that Google will. You talk about big headlines about this, but I'm waiting for the headline to come out that says, right now, people think that less than 1% of Google's revenue is at risk because of this. It's a $90 billion revenue company, I've seen headlines that say $750 million might come off of YouTube's revenue in 2017 because of this. Bigger fraction of YouTube's revenue, but you're not just an investor in YouTube when you buy a stock in Alphabet. So, I'm still confident that they'll figure it out. And between the two of them, Facebook and Google, they're pretty much the only two that are growing in the digital ad space. So, I find it hard to believe that advertisers are going to completely move away from Google. Right now, Facebook is really the only alternative, and that space would become far too crowded too quickly if there was a mass exodus from Google. I'm fairly confident that, because you said 20% of their revenue comes from that search advertising, they're going to figure this out. Hill: It is a small amount of money, and yet, when you look at the headline of Pepsi, Starbucks, General Motors, Wal-Mart have pulled some of their ad spend with YouTube. Those are big-name companies. I think, if you're Facebook, you're not throwing a parade over this, but I think if you're selling video advertising for Facebook, you're on the phone to different media agencies, and I also think television networks. If you're a broadcast network or cable network, to use your phrase, Jason, you're putting the human touch to work, and you're calling these companies and saying, "Listen, don't take a risk with the programmatic algorithm approach to YouTube. You know what you're going to get with our networks, and you're going to get something that associates well with your brand." Muckerman: With some of those companies you mentioned, those are companies that can afford to pull back for a week or two on advertising and make a statement. That's almost advertising in itself. They're still advertising using Google's name, just not using Google's platform. So, I think they'll come back eventually. Probably not too far down the line. Those brands are brands already. You're probably looking at the smaller players, questioning whether or not they can afford to back off of Google's platform a little bit more than Coke or Pepsi. Moser: Yeah, and I think it's also worth noting, for the longest time, YouTube has been synonymous with online video. That's what got this ball rolling. And they've enjoyed such a phenomenal competitive position for so long. What an acquisition Google made for ... what did they buy it for? Hill: $1.6 billion. Muckerman: Pennies on the current dollar. Hill: And the reason I remember it was $1.6 billion is because I was one of the people saying, "Boy, they sure did pay a lot of money for that." Moser: So, I think you fast forward today and you see how this competitive environment has changed, Google and YouTube are not the only players in the online video space. And you see all sorts of companies, from Facebook and Twitter to Verizon and AT&T developing their online video offerings. To your point, I think it's very easy to see these customers pulling back for a week, a month, and saying, "Hey, let's reasses what's going on here." Google and YouTube are too big to say, "We don't want to be a part of your environment." That's just foregoing a tremendous reach that anybody in their right mind would want to be a part of. But, what it could do is, it could result in some pricing competition. It can certainly make Google have to get in there and compete a bit more on pricing, lose a bit, perhaps, of that pricing power, particularly as we ship to mobile, and we know those mobile advertisements are not nearly as lucrative as the desktops were, from a real estate perspective. But, these are smart people running a very, very big company. The solution to this really is as simple as, listen to your customers and give them what they want. So, from that perspective, I don't see any reason why they can't fix it. I guess it's going to be interesting to see how they fix it, and how quickly they go about fixing it, because they don't enjoy that same competitive position that they enjoyed, perhaps, five years ago. Hill: Our email address is marketfoolery@fool.com. From Matt Saunders in Nestleton, Ontario. "I was hoping you could explain the effects of currency exchange on stock purchases. I'm in Canada and our dollar is quite low compared to the U.S. dollar. However, it wasn't too many years ago, we peaked a little higher than the U.S. dollar. My concern is that if I buy a U.S. company at this point and the dollar rises again, will that work against the value of the U.S. company that I purchased? Or does buying on the TSX compensate for that somehow? Thanks for all your help with this. P.S. please tell Steve Broido, we just made a trip to Orlando and had a great visit to an Olive Garden there. Definitely a fan." Steve will appreciate that, I'm sure. Muckerman: Yeah. Thanks for listening all the way from Ontario. This was a question that we receive quite often in Stock Advisor Canada, Pro Canada, and now Dividend Investor Canada. We put a special report about this a couple years back. Over those couple years, not much has changed. Remain to see the Canadian dollar still trading below the U.S. dollar. I think right now, it's around $0.75 to the U.S. dollar. As you did mention earlier in the 2000s, the Canadian dollar did peak around $1.20 to the U.S. dollar. That ramp-up really did cramp Canadian investors' returns when you look at it, from investing in the U.S. dollar. When the Canadian dollar does appreciate, you lose a little bit there when you sell back into the Canadian market. So, what we generally tell our members to do is, A) we absolutely recommend investing in the U.S. market, because when you look at the Canadian market, about two-thirds of it relies on the energy, financials, and the materials sector, two very volatile sectors, in the energy and materials sector and then financials, really, the bulk of that is driven by the big banks, TD, Scotia, CIBC, BMO, and RBC. They're very highly concentrated if you don't move outside of the Canadian market. When you look at the largest sector in the U.S., IT, I think that's around almost 22% of the S&P, it's 2.7% of the S&P TSX. So, you're missing out on a lot of potential growth there. And less than 1% of the S&P TSX is healthcare. If you think about that, you're missing out on some huge potential growth there. It was a little higher, but Valeant obviously reduced the share of that overall market when that fell precipitously over the last couple years.  But, the long-term average of the Canadian dollar to the U.S. dollar is right around $0.85. There's about 13% upside from where it is right now until it reaches the long-term average, I think we have information going back to 1971 on our site. That's over 30 to 40 years of data with the long-term average of $0.85 to the U.S. dollar. So, you're not far away from that. Compared to that $1.20 you saw in the early 2000s, we view that as a one-off event, especially with oil where it is these days, and the likelihood that remains subdued as compared to when it was over $100, which, coincidentally, timed very well with when it was peaking with the U.S. dollar there. So, we advocate people considering the Canadian dollar to the U.S. dollar exchange rate, but we don't say, "Just invest Canadian only." Put some dollars into a separate account, leave them there for the long-term so you don't have to pay the cost to exchange back and forth, because banks do charge for that. And you don't get charged if the company pays you a U.S. dollar dividend and you leave it in U.S. dollars. You don't get charged every time they deposit the dividend to your account. You only get charged if you put it back into CAD. So, if you're a long-term investor, we just say, create two accounts, one with Canadian dollars and one with U.S. dollars, and let it ride, because if you don't, you're going to miss out on tons of opportunity. TSX and TSX Venture stocks make up about 20% of the -- Hill: Toronto Stock Exchange. Muckerman: Yep. They make up about 20% of the total stocks available to you in U.S. markets. So, not only are you missing out on diversification, but you're missing out on opportunity, in terms of breadth of choices. So, don't let the currency fluctuations scare you away from it. That's our opinion. Hill: You've been to the Toronto Stock Exchange, haven't you? Muckerman: Yeah, it's pretty cool. We went there a few years ago, poked around when we were first launching Stock Advisor Canada in 2013. Been up there a couple times since, but to not the same fanfare that we went up there a few years back. Hill: Definitely a lot of fun. Fitting that I'm sitting with too proud sons of the Carolinas because, for any sports fans out there, the final four is set. We have Gonzaga, we have the University of North Carolina, we have Oregon, and we have, surprisingly, the University of South Carolina. And the potential for an all-Carolina final. Moser: Amazing. If you think about it this way, you had Clemson just win the National Championship in college football. There is still the potential, certainly, for the Gamecocks to go in there and win this thing in basketball. Which, I mean, there's no way that's ever been achieved before. Muckerman: They have to win this, because the likelihood of a potential rematch with North Carolina in the final, highly unlikely. Although, this could boost recruiting. Moser: About half of my graduating class in high school went to USC. The other half -- Hill: The other USC. Most people hear USC and they think University of Southern California. Moser: The East Coast, South Carolina. The other half went the Clemson. And I was the one lone straggler that went the opposite direction and went to a 15-person liberal arts college. Go, Wofford Terriers. Hill: Wait, isn't Wofford in North Carolina? Moser: Wofford is in South Carolina. You have Davidson that's in North Carolina. Muckerman: Steph Curry. Moser: But, wow, the finish to that game yesterday was ... Muckerman: The Carolina game? Yeah, my gosh. Moser: Yeah, it was unbelievable. I have to believe that right now, the Carolinas are figuring out a way to, perhaps, join together, erase that border. Hill: There was a story I read this morning -- and, obviously, there's so many millions of dollars involved in the NCAA basketball tournament. But one of the stories I read this morning was about the business impact in North and South Carolina. And, not surprisingly, bars and restaurants doing huge business over the weekend, and presumably will do it again next weekend. Moser: That'd be like one of those things in an earnings report where, that's one of those one-time events. So, when you're saying, "Well, we don't expect this next March, but we had a very robust beginning of 2017, thanks to ... " Hill: You're saying Jason's Barbecue and Sports Bar, in South Carolina, when it's reporting earnings in the spring of 2018, it's like, "Look, tough comp. Last year, we had the final four. We had Clemson in the football championship." Muckerman: Seriously. Clemson. USC has to catch up. Maybe think about extending Tobacco Road a little for their South. Hill: I don't know how big the concentration of Buffalo Wild Wings is in the Carolinas but I do remember -- Muckerman: There's quite a few. Hill: -- two years ago, when Tom Brady was first suspended by the NFL, and he was going to miss four games, and this was going into the fall of 2015, I do remember that on a conference call, there was an analyst who asked CEO Sally Smith, this analysts had the numbers and basically said, "Here's how many Buffalo Wild Wings locations are in New England. Tom Brady is going to miss," and he ended up appealing and not missing, but he missed the first four of this most recent season, but -- and I give credit to this analyst, he did his homework. It's just like, "Look, you have a bunch of Buffalo Wild Wings locations in New England. The star quarterback of the home team is going to miss the first four games. Are you factoring that?" Legit question. Moser: I guess my question here is, Oregon is with Under Armour, too. Hill: Wait a minute, Oregon? No, that's a Nike -- Moser: Is Oregon Nike? OK. I was just thinking, I saw something, I was looking at this headline, Oregon Signs Record-Breaking Apparel Deal With Under Armour, and -- Hill: Are you sure it's not Oregon State? Moser: No, it says Oregon. Hill: Because University of Oregon is Phil Knight's alma mater. Muckerman: Their football field is Nike sole turf. Moser: I'm aware! Let's go in and confirm this, but this is back from 2014, but Oregon signs record-breaking apparel deal with Under Armour. The deal was announced just hours after Phil Knight announced he would no longer allow Nike to be associated with Oregon, citing his frustration with a lack of national championships. Muckerman: This isn't The Onion? Moser: No, this is SB Nation. [laughs] I guess Phil Knight got sick of a bunch of losers! And he decided to bag it. If that's the case, how interesting that you would then have two representatives of Under Armour and two of Nike. Muckerman: So, Gonzaga and Carolina obviously -- Moser: Carolina is Nike, and I think Gonzaga is too. Oregon is the one I was questioning, because South Carolina is definitely Under Armour, and I think Oregon is, too. Muckerman: Michael Jordan hasn't eschewed Carolina just yet, I guess. Moser: That's pretty cool. Hill: Yes. And the University of Oregon women's team is in the regional final that's being played tonight. They're playing UConn. Muckerman: I'm so sorry for them. Moser: Right, I was going to say, why don't they just hand them the trophy? It's Connecticut, can they really ... Hill: You know what? That's what amazing Cinderella stories are made out of. Moser: At some point, everybody thought Kentucky was going to win, but Wisconsin, was it Wisconsin? Hill: Yeah, back in the day, a couple years ago. Look, if Goliath was undefeated, where's the fun in that? We need David to knock off Goliath every once in awhile. So who knows? The lady Ducks might get it done against UConn. Muckerman: Lady Ducks and the Gamecocks.  Hill: That's your lead story, by the way, if the UConn women don't end up winning the national championship. All right, Jason Moser, Taylor Muckerman thanks for being here, guys. Muckerman: Cheers! Moser: Thank you! Hill: As always, people on the program may have interests in the stocks they talk about, and The Motley Fool may have recommendations for or against, so don't buy or sell stocks based solely on what you hear.

The Lowdown is Ad Age's weekly look at news nuggets from across the world of marketing, including trends, campaign tidbits, executive comings and goings and more. Kit Kat maker Nestle joins the list of marketers halting Google/YouTube spending.   Credit: Nestle via KitKat via YouTube Add Nestle to the list of marketers that have stopped Google spending over the issue of ads being placed with objectionable content. "We have decided to pause our media buying with Google/YouTube and Google Display Network pending reassurances from them on actions to address the problem of brand advertising appearing on inappropriate websites," a spokeswoman said in an email statement. "Nestle uses a significant amount of online advertising for our brands, and we have taken measures to ensure that our media placements only appear on appropriate websites and other online channels." Nestle joins J&J, Walmart, General Motors, PepsiCo and others making similar moves since last week. Google declines to comment on advertising decisions by individual advertisers but said in a blog post last week that it's taking steps to give advertisers more control over where their ads appear and prevent placements on inappropriate content. Sure the Kraft Heinz takeover offer for Unilever seemed like a stretch, but how big? According to strategic consultancy Brand Finance, the value of the Unilever brand portfolio is more than double that of Kraft Heinz -- $42.9 billion vs. $20.2 billion. Then again, if the Brand Finance numbers are to be believed, maybe Kraft Heinz was onto something in terms of Unilever being undervalued. Unilever's sales are also more than twice as high as Kraft Heinz's, but the difference in sales is actually bigger than the difference in brand value, suggesting those sales aren't producing quite the value bang per buck for Unilever. At any rate, Unilever stock remains about 20% above where it stood before the offer, as its board continues to mull strategic options, so Kraft Heinz and their friends at 3G Capital seemingly did Unilever shareholders a favor. The deal fell through after Unilever rejected it and Berkshire Hathaway Chairman-CEO Warren Buffett made clear he wouldn't back a hostile bid. Unilever's Dove in recent years has celebrated curly hair without making an explicitly ethnic appeal, but now Procter & Gamble Co.'s Pantene is doing just that for an African-American market that often feels overlooked by mass brands. "There is still a level of inequality in how African-American hair is represented in popular culture and in mainstream hair-care advertising," Pantene said in a release. "Mass brands, like Pantene, have inadvertently been a part of this pervasive hair bias with a history of advertising showcasing a limited representation of African-American hairstyles." To address that, the brand launched an ad last week by Grey New York featuring brand ambassador Jillian Hervey with African-American women of all ages. The brand also has launched the Gold Series of premium products for African-American women. "Brad's wife," who as seemingly everyone knows by now was apparently let go from her 11-year job at Cracker Barrel, continues to generate buzz for the restaurant chain. Bradley Reid first posted about the issue on his personal Facebook page in late February, followed by another post in early March on his birthday, and things have escalated since then. So far, Cracker Barrel has let #JusticeforBradsWife and other comments lead the conversation. Digital content engagement around the brand has soared 304%, when comparing Feb. 27-March 28, 2017 to the month before, data from Amobee shows. Social interaction has picked up in the last few days, as people continue to pepper Cracker Barrel with comments and questions tied to Brad's wife and promote a Change.org petition seeking answers from the CEO on the dismissal of Nanette. From March 22-28, 92% of all Cracker Barrel digital engagement was related to Brad, Amobee said. Cracker Barrel, which has not responded to a request for comment, is seeing negative sentiment. From March 22 through 1 p.m. EDT March 28, the @CrackerBarrel handle was mentioned 7,400 times on Twitter. Sentiment around those tweets was 85% negative, 6% neutral and 9% positive, Amobee said. And as Cracker Barrel appears to be waiting this out, at least one other restaurant is getting into the conversation. A Chick-fil-A posted an image on Facebook with a "Now hiring Brad's wife" sign on March 23, and from then through March 28, 20% of all of Chick-fil-A's digital engagement was related to Brad. Someone let Nanette know. #justiceforbradswife #bosscow pic.twitter.com/8fEZQpW9f2 — ChickfilA GeorgiaSt (@cfageorgiast) March 24, 2017 "'Brad's Wife' didn't start as a Cracker Barrel-generated campaign but it can end as one," Jonathan Cohen, Amobee's principal brand analyst, said in a statement. "By finding a way to respond to the meme, and by amplifying that messaging across paid media, Cracker Barrel can leverage the high level of interest around the story and turn a negative into a positive." Onto some less-polarizing restaurant news … Some of Taco Bell's Live Más scholarship recipients got more than money to pursue and showcase varied passions. The scholarship was started to award students interested in a mix of topics, rather than basing funding on academics and athletics, and applicants submit videos to enter. Now, Taco Bell is promoting the effort in new ads created by and featuring recipients. The ads also feature taco packaging designed by scholarship recipients. The push coincides with the fifth anniversary of the Doritos Locos taco. Commercials that began airing Sunday remind people that for each a la carte Doritos Locos taco purchased March 23-April 8, Taco Bell will donate 10 cents (up to $500,000) to continue funding the scholarships. Taco Bell said it plans to award $1.3 million this year to 155 students, with awards ranging from $5,000 to $25,000. O'Keefe Reinhard & Paul created the commercials with content from the scholarship recipients, who were listed in the credits. "As we continue to grow the Live Más Scholarship program, our vision is that it becomes 'for the kids, by the kids,'" Chief Marketing Officer Marisa Thalberg said in a statement. Waze is taking the idea of in-app marketing and personalization one step further in a new partnership with longtime advertiser Dunkin' Donuts. Members of the Dunkin' Donuts DD Perks program who have the coffee chain's app can now order ahead within Waze. The navigation and traffic tracking app will locate the nearest Dunkin' Donuts restaurant and launch Dunkin's on-the-go ordering. Waze and Dunkin' said users can cut the line inside Dunkin' Donuts once they get there, but there's still not an option to jump to the front of the drive-thru line. Waze plans to roll out the order ahead feature "with more brand advertisers in the near future," Jordan Grossman, Waze's head of business partnerships, North America, said in a statement. One of marketing's longest-running streaks of success recently ended when Kroger Co. reported comparable-store sales fell in the fourth quarter, ending 52 quarters of growth in the measure that were fueled largely by a loyalty program run by Dunnhumby USA and later Kroger's fully owned offshoot of the agency, 84.51. CEO Rodney McMullen noted in a conference call earlier this month that he was "disappointed." Chief Financial Officer Mike Schlotman did offer some explanations, including grocery price deflation and the removal of 35 strong-performing stores from the calculation due to them being relocated or expanded. It's certainly not as exciting as Game 7 of last year's World Series, but T-Mobile is offering its users unlimited live streaming baseball for an entire year at no cost. The promotion kicks off April 4 during Major League Baseball's opening week, allowing subscribers to download both MLB.TV Premium and MLB.com At Bat Premium for free. The carrier's push is part of a weekly giveaway via the its "T-Mobile Tuesdays" app. Common freebies include free Papa John's Pizza or $15 Lyft credits. Next month's promotion, however, might be the biggest of the year, as both MLB.TV and MLB At Bat retail for about $115 combined. The promotion ends April 5. Ford Performance Credit: Ford Here's the latest example of brand-as-media provider: Ford announced today that it will be the exclusive live distribution channel this season for the FIA World Rallycross Championship Presented by Monster Energy. Twelve races will be streamed live on the Ford Performance Facebook page. "We are always looking for innovative ways to provide more value to our fans and customers in the U.S.," Henry Ford III, global marketing manager for Ford Performance, said in a statement. "Our partnership with IMG will not only make it easier for fans to watch Ken Block and Andreas Bakkerud live as they compete for the 2017 world championship, but it will also be an enhanced experience for those viewers." Finally, Lowdown has one executive move to report this week … Popeyes Chief Brand Officer Dick Lynch is leaving the chain now that it has been acquired by Restaurant Brands International Inc. Cheryl Bachelder, who just left the role of Popeyes CEO, in a statement called Mr. Lynch a "catalyst for Popeyes remarkable growth over the past nine years." Mr. Lynch led the effort of focusing on Popeyes' Louisiana roots in is food and marketing featuring spokeswoman Annie. He has been heavily involved in working on marketing succession plans, including finding a new chief marketing officer, Popeyes said. Contributing: Jack Neff, Jessica Wohl, George Slefo, E.J.

Reproflex 3 is the first company in the UK to purchase a Zünd G3 digital cutting table for this application in the packaging market. Until its installation, the company was hand-cutting or outsourcing die-cutting work on a flat-bed machine.  With three sites in Cramlington, near Newcastle upon Tyne, plus a facility in Dubai, Reproflex 3 manages the transition of new packaging designs to finished, printed products, in particular flexible packaging. Its client list is primarily blue chip brands and design agencies and includes Unilever, Procter and Gamble, Coca-Cola and Müller and supplies over 20,000 sqm of polymer each year.  To manage this sizeable output, Reproflex 3 researched options for a digital cutting system that would hit the ground running and last well into the future. Having seen the Zünd G3 at printing industry show Drupa and compared it with its competitors, the company installed the solution late last year.  "We tested the competition and found that the Zünd's workflow technology was by far the easier to use," explains Andrew Hewitson, Managing Director of Reproflex 3. "It has an open platform meaning our existing systems are able to drive it – the workflow is seamless.  "Zünd has an amazing reputation and we've found that the quality of our polymer plates has improved for sure. We have more options for our packaging, with specific sizes now possible to make superior end products. It all just makes sense." Reproflex 3 also has a department for carton designs, with the Zünd G3 being put to use creating mock-ups of finished designs in cut carton, board and corrugated materials before full production. The Zünd G3 is an advanced, highly automated cutting table with modular tool and material-handling systems to enable exceptional output for a wide range of applications, across the packaging market and beyond. It has been designed by experts at Zünd's Swiss development facility to meet the needs of each unique user, with an extensive set of complementary tools and modules available to ensure the perfect configuration both upon installation and as requirements change in the future – with a robust build to withstand updates and 24-7 production. "We work with many companies across the packaging market but Reproflex 3 is the first in the UK to use our equipment in the finishing of polymer plates, further proving its versatility," says Peter Giddings, Sales Director, Zünd Plotting Systems (UK) Ltd.       Tweet       Email    Print    Order Reprints   Post a Comment To post a comment Log In or Become a Member, doing so is simple and free   Industry News Alliance Franchise Brands Adds Aleyant tFLOW to its WorkStream Technology Package Esko solutions automate the printing process and extend productivity at Graphics Canada 2017  Brian Platte Lifetime Achievement Award Presented at Xploration 17 Sun Chemical Forms Joint Venture with Alliance Holding Company, LTD NPES Announces Sponsorship of IPMA 2017 Annual Conference Neenah Introduces Newly Revised CLASSIC Papers Portfolio with New Colors and New Textures  NPES and Idealliance Members Hit Capitol Hill Urging Support for Postal Reform All Today's Industry News » SHARE Email Tweet Print Video New Software Technology Introduced to a Printer RPIprint Achieves Near-Touchless Order-to-Delivery Process with Workflow Automation Xeikon introduces their first UV Inkjet Label Production Printer Guy Gecht on the State of the Inkjet Business Global Graphics: Working to Support Industry Efficiency CalPoly Students Create Book about Printing Pioneer Michael Bruno More Video » WhatTheyThink Job Board CEO at Brilliant, Inc in Exton, PA Print Press Manager/Operator at Schur Star Systems, Inc. in Carlsbad, CA prepress technician at Goodcopy Printing Center Inc in New Haven CT MIS Software Sales at Tharstern, Inc in Chicago / New York Project Manager of Consulting & Programming at IDEALLIANCE in Alexandria, VA View More Jobs Recent Blog Posts Customer Experience 2.0 (Digital Nirvana) 25 Tips for Successful Content Marketing (Digital Nirvana) Unemployment Rate Steady at 6.3%; Data Imply Stabilizing Labor Market (Dr. Joe) What is Responsive Web Design?

They showcased exemplary corporate initiatives in responding to the call for greater equality and diversity at the Second annual HeforShe conference held in Shanghai on Tuesday. Hosted by AmCham (American Chamber of Commerce) Shanghai, the event this year was themed on “Paving the Way to the Top — Solutions for Advancing Gender Diversity,” and focused on corporate responses that make a real difference. The HeforShe Solidarity movement, launched by UN Women in September, 2014, calls for men and women to work together to end gender inequality. Sarah Kochling, co-founder and co-chair of the AmCham Shanghai Women’s Executive Network, highlighted the importance of educating people about gender balance at work. “Today’s corporate leaders recognize that diversity is just smart business — whether it’s providing them better access to female-driven markets, strengthening their workforce engagement or supporting superior innovation initiatives by accommodating different points of view,” she said. “Just like working across cultures, working across genders is increasingly being identified as an important management skill for all employees,” Kochling said. Recent Catalyst Corporate winners Gap Inc. and Procter & Gamble have introduced policy initiatives and programs to encourage diversity, highlighting how their focus on women has helped business. “At Gap Inc, equality for all employees has been deeply embedded in our culture since our company has been equally invested by a female and a male, Doris and Don Fisher,” said Aina Konold, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Gap Inc, Greater China. She said she has been fortunate to work for and be mentored by many working women, many of whom are mothers like her. Konold also identified some factors affecting working women, as shaped by Chinese culture, for instance: the great availability of grandparents to help with the care of grandchildren, and the greater parental and social pressure for women aged 25-30 to find a spouse, or be seen as “leftovers.” Such factors affect their ability to work. Norbert Ehlert, general manager of human resources at P&G in China, stressed the company’s commitment to providing equal access to education and economic opportunities. “As a company that understands women and girls, we are leveraging our insights to uncover gender bias and taking action to spark conversations and set new expectations that motivate change,” Ehlert said. Identifying female leadership Ehlert says his company has been good at identifying female leadership very early in their life, adding the company is achieving diversity goals through its brands, its corporate voice, and the help of people and partners inside and outside the company. Li Qiang, Co-Country Managing Partner China for DLA Piper, points out China’s policies have boosted the number of women working. In China women’s labor participation has been consistently very high. Problems remain. During the March 8 Women’s Day, women might have a day off, have some fun, but there are still challenges in our understanding of diversity. Li stressed the importance of gender equality, pointing out that as a professional service provider, the key to success is building trust within the team. Michael Wong, HR partner for EY Greater China, pointed to the importance of assessing performance by focusing on results, rather than face time, as family obligations mean flexibility in working hours might work better for some women employees. “As a result of technology, as long as they can finish their job, it does not really matter whether this is done at home, on a train, or a plane,” he says. Panelists also discussed what companies are doing to increase the visibility of women in traditionally male dominated STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) organizations. Since gender equality is not just a women’s issue, AmCham Shanghai believes that men have a crucial role to play in achieving equality and diversity. AmCham Shanghai’s Women’s Executive Network was established in 2014 as part of the Chamber’s commitment to promoting female leadership and gender equality in the workplace.

News and Press Release Distribution, Since 1995 Deliver Your News to the World Sign In Create a Free Account Home News How We Work Compare Services FAQ All WebPost WebPost PPC WebRelease Targeted Media Wire Service Top WBENC Consumer Companies Join Together for the First Time in Collective Initiative to Source from Women-Owned Businesses BENTONVILLE, ARK. – WEBWIRE – Wednesday, March 29, 2017 Walmart announced today that they are one of nine corporations joining in a collaborative effort to track and report sourcing from self-identified and certified women-owned businesses (WOBs) over the next five years. This marks the first time the Womens Business Enterprise National Council (WBENC), the largest third-party certifier of businesses owned, controlled and operated by women in the U.S., will launch a formal initiative to publicly report aggregated spending on WOBs. Walmart helped form this unified front of major corporations, including Campbell Soup Company, The Coca-Cola Company, ExxonMobil, General Mills, Johnson & Johnson, Mondelēz International, PepsiCo and Procter & Gamble, in order to create a more visible movement and raise awareness for the importance of sourcing from women-owned businesses. Walmart made the announcement on behalf of the other companies involved and WBENC at Walmarts Womens Economic Empowerment (WEE) Summit in Washington, D.C., a convening of leaders from business, government, NGOs and academia to discuss and celebrate the achievements of womens empowerment. Creating economic opportunity and growth is central to who we are as a company, said Doug McMillon, president and CEO of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. We are proud to be part of this important initiative, and together we can make an even bigger impact in elevating these successful women-owned businesses. Our customers care where products are sourced, and we believe supporting women-owned businesses helps us put innovative products on our shelves while helping these businesses thrive and grow. Campbell is proud to join this collaborative effort in order to raise awareness and foster more opportunities for female business owners, said Denise Morrison, president and CEO, Campbell Soup Company. One of the core values of our company is to seek the power of different and we are committed to assemble a supplier base that reflects the diversity of the consumers and communities we serve. Empowering women entrepreneurs and women-owned firms is smart business and smart economics, said Muhtar Kent, chairman and CEO of The Coca-Cola Company. Whenever you do the right thing and give businesswomen a real opportunity to compete, this creates a positive ripple effect that allows her to strengthen her company, her family and her community. And stronger families and communities help fuel more growth and opportunity. Women and minority-owned businesses are critical to both their communities and our company as they spur economic development and drive growth, said Irene Rosenfeld, Chairman and CEO of Mondelēz International. We are proud to support this important initiative, as we continue to strive for inclusion and diversity in our company and womens empowerment around the world. Supporting women-owned businesses and diversity across our suppliers is central to who we are at PepsiCo, said Indra K. Nooyi, Chairman and CEO of PepsiCo. Our commitment to diversity is not only a source of pride, it is a source of strength. And its part of our broader commitment to what we call Performance with Purpose, our approach to building a healthier, sustainable future for all our stakeholders  from our suppliers to our shareholders to our consumers, customers, employees, and the communities we serve. P&G is committed to Gender Equality, said Carolyn Tastad, group president of P&Gs North America business. Supplier Diversity has been an important business strategy at P&G in the United States for more than 40 years. We are proud to join this initiative to empower women-owned businesses, as we believe in the power of economic inclusion. When the ownership of our supply base reflects the diversity of our employees, consumers, and stakeholders, our business grows and our community thrives. By participating in this initiative, these companies will help fuel innovation and growth for women-owned businesses across the U.S., said Pamela Prince-Eason, president and CEO of WBENC. With women-owned businesses currently supporting the creation or maintenance of 23 million American jobs, investing in their growth means investing in more opportunities for the workforce overall. The initiative comes at a critical time when women entrepreneurs across a range of countries report having smaller and less diverse networks, leaving them at a disadvantage for growth, innovation and ability to be relevant to a global market (Global Entrepreneurship Monitor). Walmart helped to recruit this initial group of corporations to take part in this initiative and is encouraging others to join as well. This announcement comes on the heels of the culmination of Walmarts five-year Global WEE Initiative, which included a set of goals to help empower women around the world through sourcing, training and supporting diversity and inclusion. As part of the WEE Initiative, Walmart sourced $20 billion from women-owned businesses in the U.S. and increased sourcing from women-owned businesses internationally. Additionally, in 2014, working with WBENC and WEConnect International, a global network that connects women-owned businesses to qualified buyers around the world, Walmart helped fund the creation of the Women-Owned logo which can be used by any woman-owned supplier certified by those organizations at any retailer to highlight their products to consumers. Today, Walmart has more than 1,500 suppliers who identify as women-owned businesses, producing everything from apparel to produce. In addition to participating in this collective initiative, Walmart announced plans to launch a Knowledge Center that will house the key tools, resources, learnings and achievements of the WEE Initiative and help serve as a guide for any company or institution in their work to empower women.

Matthew Frankel, The Motley Fool 6:32 a.m. ET March 29, 2017 There are some stocks that tend to do better than the market during tough times. Customers walk out of a Dollar Tree Store in Barre, Vt. (Photo: Toby Talbot, AP) 3 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Q: With the stock market at record highs, I'm worried that we could be overdue for a crash. What are some stocks that could help protect my portfolio? There are several types of stocks that tend to outperform the market during crashes and corrections. One big category is long-established dividend-growth stocks, particularly those that have raised their dividend every year for a long time period. Companies like AT&T, Procter & Gamble and Johnson & Johnson immediately come to mind. These stocks have increased their dividends by 32, 60, and 54 consecutive years, respectively, and all three handily beat the S&P 500 in 2008, the last time the market crashed. In addition, consider companies that sell non-discretionary items at the cheapest prices. Dollar stores, such as Dollar Tree, are an excellent example of this, as they sell products that people need (as opposed to things they want) at lower prices than their competitors. Many businesses like this actually do better in tough economies, as they benefit from consumers who become more value-conscious. In fact, while the S&P 500 lost nearly 38% in 2008, Dollar Tree actually gained 65% for the year. As many successful investors know, it's more important to outperform during the tough times than it is to capture the market's performance in years when everything is going up. And while there's no way to accurately predict when the next market correction or crash will come, stocks like these can help you get through it in good shape.

Work, relationships, and money problems are some of the most common triggers, according to the National Health Service. When you have a lot going on at work, it can get even harder to focus. This can result in a build-up of more work you haven't been able to concentrate on, thus causing a vicious cycle of a more stress. CEOs and founders of big companies have all gone through stressful moments like everyone else, and they all have different ways of dealing with the tough times. Here are how some of the most successful people in the world have learned to unwind after years of managing the stress that comes with running a global business. 1. Bill Gates reads before he goes to bed Bedtime reader: Bill Gates (AP Photo/Nati Harnik) Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates likes to read before bed. He told The Seattle Times he reads for at least an hour, no matter how late it is. The best books on happiness- in pictures 7 show all The best books on happiness- in pictures 1/7 Boost the happiness in your life with a little help from one of these books... 2/7 Stumbling on Happiness by Daniel Gilbert It’s probably fair to say that we all make certain choices without thinking too much about the consequences , whether that’s to overeat, over drink or over spend- even though we know we’ll regret it later. Psychologist Daniel Gilbert looks into the neuroscience behind this as well as why most of us have no idea how to make ourselves happy. Exploring our inability to really see what will and will not bring us a brighter future, Gilbert’s dry wit makes this a great read. We confidently predict that reading it will lift your mood. £10, Amazon, Buy it now 3/7 -A Guide to Developing Life’s Most Important Skill by Matthieu Ricard Why is it that even when we are living a life that, once upon a time, we could only dream of do we still often feel unfulfilled? In this refreshing book, scientist- turned- Buddhist monk Ricard talks about the art of creating happiness out of what we have now, rather than things we think will transform our lives in the future. Filled with practical exercises and free of superfluous jargon, Ricard’s own happiness emanates from the language, making the reader believe that it really is possible to create a happier life. £10, Amazon, Buy it now 4/7 Happy by Fearne Cotton There’s something reassuring about reading a book that’s not been written by an expert- in Fearne Cotton’s hotly anticipated Happy you get the sense that you’re chatting with a friend. Bringing to light her own struggles with mental health issues, Cotton shares some easy-to-follow, everyday exercises and anecdotes that have helped her get through tough times. Not to be dismissed as merely ‘another celebrity memoir,’ it brings together the common challenges faced that can impede upon everyday happiness, rather than thinking of happiness in a grandiose or abstract way. This is a great one to dip in and out of. £7, Amazon, Buy it now 5/7 Better Than Before by Gretchen Rubin In this hilarious mixture of anecdotes and research-backed advice, Rubin addresses the inherently human behaviour of making and breaking habits. From diets to practicing an instrument every day, we are always trying to start or stop a habit. But why is it that even when it’s something we love, or something we know is really bad for us, can’t make the habit stick? Rubin answers questions such as this in a bit to help us lead our best lives. Of course, the best part of any self-help book is when you get to look at yourself- this book provides ample opportunity for that in the form of personality quizzes and practical guides to help you better understand your own behaviour. £6.30, Amazon, Buy it now 6/7 The Book of Joy by the Dalai Lama & Desmond Tutu You’d think that years of hardship and oppression would make you miserable, but for Nobel Peace Prize laureates Desmond Tutu and the Dalai Lama, this simply isn’t the case. In this collaboration, two of the world’s most joyful global figures reflect upon their own lives and try to answer the question that burns all of us: how can humans find happiness in the face of suffering? £9, Amazon,Buy it now 7/7 Year of Yes by Shonda Rhimes What if you said yes to every opportunity that came your way for a whole year? Well that’s exactly what Shonda Rhimes did to hilarious and often poignant effect. Written by the creator of Grey’s Anatomy and Scandal, it offers insight into how accepting opportunity- even if you don’t initially want to- can transform your life. £9, Amazon,Buy it now Gates has also taken a lot of advice from Warren Buffett over the years. In an interview with Fortune magazine, Gates said something he learned from Buffett was to keep things simple. "His ability to boil things down, to just work on the things that really count, to think through the basics — it's so amazing that he can do that. It's a special form of genius." In other words, strip away all the fuss and it's easier to focus on the task at hand. 2. Tim Cook tunes out the cynics Tuning out: Apple CEO Tim Cook (AP) After receiving an honorary degree from The University of Glasgow, Apple CEO Tim Cook advised students to stay positive and tune out a lot of the noise you'll come up against in life. Listening to everyone all the time is incredibly stressful. "In today's environment, the world is full of cynics and you have to tune them out," he said. "Because if not, they become a cancer in your mind, in your thinking, and you begin thinking that you can't or that life is negative." 3. Meg Whitman goes fly-fishing Meg Whitman has had an amazing career at several massive companies, including P&G, eBay, and now Hewlett-Packard. In an interview with Fast Company, Whitman mentioned her love of fly-fishing. She and her son go about six times every year. According to research from the University of California's Merced campus, engaging in leisure activities can provide immediate stress relief, and can also have other health benefits. Research from the National Library of Medicine also showed regular leisure activity can manage negative feelings such as stress. 4. Warren Buffet plays the ukulele Warren Buffet, one of the most successful investors in the world, is a man of many hobbies. He enjoys playing the ukulele, and has even performed on live news. The study from the University of California, Merced, also found engaging in a mentally stimulating activity such as learning an instrument can help reduce stress. 5. Sheryl Sandberg turns off her phone at night Switching off: Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg For Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, it isn't so much about what she does, but what she doesn't do. She tries to stop herself scrolling through social media or reading emails at night by turning her phone off. She told USA Today it's painful to switch off, but she gets the benefits of not being disturbed throughout the night. After all, a better night's sleep makes it a lot easier to deal with stressful situations the morning after. Looking at our laptop and phone screens late at night is very bad for us, according to research which has shown the light can prevent our bodies from releasing a hormone called melatonin which helps us sleep. Basically, the less screen time at night, the more your body clock will thank you. 6. Jack Dorsey sticks to a schedule Man with a plan: Twitter boss Jack Dorsey (Matt Writtle) In an interview with Forbes, Twitter cofounder and CEO Jack Dorsey said the way he deals with having a lot on his plate is by having a schedule, and sticking to it. Dorsey likes to compartmentalise tasks for certain days of the week. Mondays are for meetings, Tuesdays are for developing products, Wednesdays are for marketing tasks, Thursdays are for networking, and Fridays are for building company culture. Saturday he can take a break, but it all starts up again on Sunday, which is recruitment day. "I think generally stress comes from things that are unexpected," Dorsey told Forbes. "The more you can set a cadence around what you do and the more ritual and the more consistency you can build in your schedule, the less stress you're going to have." According to New York Magazine, Dorsey also goes for a six mile run every morning. World bucket list destinations - in pictures 29 show all World bucket list destinations - in pictures 1/29 See Santorini The white walls of Santorini have to be seen to be believed. And that’s not too much of a chore – when done from an infinity pool, overlooking the blues of the Aegean. Skip summer’s party season and head there in late spring. Same island, less company. 2/29 Swim in Iceland's Blue Lagoon Iceland’s not just about the Northern lights - there's also time for unforgettable indulgence. Unwind in its geothermal spas; the bluest lagoons you'll ever see. Here’s photographic proof that it’s the 2017 destination of choice. Visit Iceland 3/29 New Zealand's South Island Yes, it’s far away. But a journey to New Zealand’s South Island is worth its weight in tourist snaps. There are almost too many things to do in New Zealand – sailing, trekking, horse-riding – so we’ll settle for gawping at the scenery. Visit New Zealand 4/29 Cruise down the Amazon The Amazon isn’t for the casual tourist; it’s wildlife overload. Take a river cruise, become a nature expert and catch some pink dolphins. 5/29 Track the Incas in Peru Peru’s the place to be but it’s not just for trendy tourists. The Inca trail to Machu Picchu is one of the best ways to gawp at human history REX 6/29 Lavender season in Provence. Does anything sound more romantic than Provence’s lavender fields? Endless rows of purple that smells as good as they look. Go in late June to see the season in full force. Shutterstock 7/29 Roadtrip through California Roadtrip through California and take in some iconic scenery. This has all the makings of a great movie; marvel at human engineering of San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge and nature's handiwork at Big Sur, on California's central coast. End up in L.A. for a Hollywood ending. The Style Traveller 8/29 Travel to Cinque Terre Travel to Cinque Terre. Italy’s rocky coastline is a UNESCO heritage site where the pastel houses cling onto the cliff edge like goats. You can spend your time trekking from village to village or just sunbathe on the rocks. It’s worth planning your trip in advance; tourist season packs these villages to the - pleasingly tattered - rafters. Shutterstock 9/29 See the real Tokyo Forget Lost in Translation and embrace the authentic side of Tokyo. There’s more to the city than neon lights and karaoke rooms. Visit the Jimbocho neighbourhood with its 180 second hand bookshops. Seek out culinary inspiration at the Isetan Department Store food hall where the candy looks like lip gloss. Or spend a cosy night in a sleep capsule at the Siesta hotel. Tie in a Christmas or New Year trip with a ski season - the ski resorts' snow monkeys are an eigth wonder of the world. Shutterstock 10/29 Marvel at Gaudi's Barcelona Marvel at Gaudi’s Barcelona. Spend hot days and long nights in the Spanish city which doubles as an architectural dream. There's coastline, a clifftop chapel and the best unfinished cathedral in the world. Gaudi’s designs are an unforgettable backdrop to a city which heaves with good food, great bars and a never-ending Picasso museum. Shutterstock 11/29 Modern art in Marfa Hidden in Texas’ vast desert is this arts hub where the art galleries look like spaceships . Make like the Instagram pack and book in at the El Cosmico campsite - sleep in a trailer under the Texan stars. At the Chinati Foudnation, you'll find Carl Andre, Claes Oldenberg and Dan Flavin. Don’t miss the Instagram opportunity at the fake Prada pop-up, just outside the town on the highway. Beyonce snapped a photo there in 2012 and two years later, Vogue labelled it a ‘pop culture landmark’. 12/29 Wildebeest migration in the Serengeti If Planet Earth 2 has got you craving nature, watching the wildebeest migration in the Serengeti is a must. Over 1.5 million wildebeest head for dry refuge in the Maasai Mara in May and witnessing the phenomenon is the ultimate in travel luxury. ROBERTO SCHMIDT/AFP/Getty Images 13/29 Climb Skellig Islands The wonderfully atmospheric backdrop for the latest Star Wars. The monastery on Skellig Michael - the larger of the two Skellig islands – was a travel destination for Christians in the sixth century. You will feel worthy; there are 600 perilous steps to climb to the top of the monastic site. No matter your convictions, something will come across you at the top. Even if it’s just the desire for an Instagram of the puffins. Shutterstock 14/29 Kick back in the Bora Bora The white sand beaches of Bora Bora are almost too pretty; its coral gardens are an unforgettable. This is honeymoon material (albeit luxury honeymoon material). 15/29 Dive the Great Barrier Reef This bucket list cliché stays on wish lists for a reason. Scuba dive through coral islands (there are 83 species of the stuff), watch out for shark fins and trek through the Daintree National Park (which can stake a claim to being the oldest tropical rainforest in the world). Getty Images/Jeff Hunter 16/29 See the Taj Mahal in person The Taj Mahal is the 17th century jewel in India’s crown. It’s been attracting tourists and royalty for centuries. It was commissioned by the emperor as a tomb for his favourite wife, and that sense of lavish romance spills into the 21st century. Pose for a photo on that bench – made famous by Diana and recreated by William and Kate – and then explore Agra by bike. Sundown on the Yamuna will be an unforgettable end to the day. 17/29 Sail around the Caribbean Experience beaches upon beaches of Caribbean tranquillity. The most exciting way to explore these far-flung islands is by boat. Pick an island (or two), drop anchor, and dive in. 18/29 The Great Wall of China It's a good walk, made extraordinary by human engineering. Trek the wall which - although you can't see it from space - still feels otherworldly. 19/29 Sail the Galapagos Islands Darwin visited in the 19th century and the islands still offer visitors magic and inspiration (though discovering an epochal scientific theory is not guaranteed). Biodiversity is big; snorkel with white-tipped sharks and sea lions. 20/29 Take in the ruins at Tulum Mexico's Mayan walled city has something for everyone. Specatular ruins, hotels approved by the fashion crowd and bars that stay open late into the night. Sink margeritas and enjoy the world class seafood which is as fresh as it gets. It's got tough competition from other entries on this list, but Tulum might also have the best beaches in the world. White sand, clear waters - it's best to see for yourself. 21/29 Wadi Rum in Jordan Channel your inner Indiana Jones and head to Wadi Rum in Jordan. It's the second Star Wars-approved bucket list destination on this list and it earns it: awe-inspiring scenery conspires with lunar landscapes for maximum impact. Getty Images 22/29 Go off-grid in the Sahara Rent a four wheel drive or go for extra horse power on a camel. Sweeping dunes await, as do iconic Hollywood locations. Recreate the English Patient in the Cave of the Swimmers. But stick to where's safe; many of the more remote parts of the desert are off-limits. FADEL SENNA/AFP/Getty Images 23/29 Explore the secret gardens of Marrakech The Morrocan capital is having a moment. Yves Saint Laurent is opening a museum for the label’s founder in 2017 and Jasper Conran unveiled his first hotel venture this year. Experience the hustle and bustle of the city's markets - and seek out calm on one of its rooftops. Getty Images 24/29 Visit Lapland in winter Winter in Lapland is straight from a Christmas card. Finland is trendy and Lapland adds tradition to that mix. Visit the huskies, the reindeer and Santa. But also take a trip to the Arktikum, the glass-roofed museum that houses the history and culture of Finland – underneath those famous green lights. Alamy 25/29 Visit orang-utans in Borneo The Borneo rainforest is full of sights that could provide a lifetime of memories. But something special lies in the orang-utan sanctuaries. Sepilok rehabilitation centre (a favourite of David Attenborough’s) lets you see the orphaned orangutans. You can take a river cruise and see the best of Borneo – proboscis monkeys, monitar lizards – and if you’re lucky, an orang-utan in the wild. EPA/BARBARA WALTON 26/29 The Grand Canyon The Grand Canyon is closest thing you’ll get to space without stepping outside this stratosphere. This is an adventurer’s sweet spot; kayak in the gorges, follow horse trails in the mountains. Or if you’re feeling above it all, hire a helicopter and view one of America’s oldest national parks from the skies. Rex Shutterstock 27/29 See Singapore’s sky gardens The gardens by the bay reach to the sky like technicolour cathedrals. The nature park was built to fill Singapore with flora and fauna. There’s nothing quite like it in the world. When you’ve got your foliage fix, take a trip to the street food van with a Michelin star. Lunch at Hong Kong Sauce Chicken Rice and Noodle is cheaper than a Big Mac, and you’re more likely to send a postcard home about it. ROSLAN RAHMAN/AFP/Getty Images 28/29 Walk New York’s High Line New York can get stuck in cliché – a snow globe of Times Square, the Empire State and the MOMA . Thank god for the High Line: this is a genuinely exciting addition to the Big Apple. Take a leisurely walk down and soak in New York’s finest; public art exhibitions and endless avenues of high rises. Maybe you’ll get snapped by the Sartorialist. Go now and see the relocated Whitney art museum, now proudly placed at the start of the High Line. Kate Lough 29/29 Drive a classic car through the Cotswolds The Cotswolds is a dreamy network of honey-coloured stone cottages, boutique spa hotels, luxury delicatessens and pubs so good one of them was just awarded a Michelin star. Top the whole experience off by renting a Jaguar E-type for the weekend. Kate Lough 7. Susan Wojcicki makes time for family holidays For YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki, managing stress is all about taking enough time off for herself. She spoke on Today about the importance of properly addressing her family life before returning to work. "I think it's really important to take time off," she said, "I've also found that sometimes you get really good insights by taking time off, too." 8. Elon Musk faces his fears head-on Facing fears: Elon Musk (AFP/Getty Images) In 2008, the worldwide economy wasn't looking good. Car companies were going bankrupt, and Tesla was struggling. CEO Elon Musk was also going through a divorce at the time. However, he managed to get through it and thrive, making calm, collected decisions along the way. So what was his secret? At the Dublin Web Summit in 2013, he explained how it's all to do with fear, and that Silicon Valley entrepreneurs just aren't afraid to fail. "Fear is finite, hope is infinite. We are afraid of failing, but it doesn't stop us from trying," he said. "People should certainly ignore fear if it's irrational. Even if it's rational and the stake is worth it, it's still worth proceeding."

Indra Nooyi focuses on self-confidence PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi learned her confidence and work ethic at a young age. She told Business Insider that every night at the dinner table, her mother would challenge her and her sister to write a speech about what they would do if they were prime minister or president. Every day it would be a different world leader they would have to pretend to be, and Nooyi's mother would vote for either her or her sister. Nooyi's grandfather, a charismatic judge, also helped her confidence. If she was unable to do something, he would make her write "I will not make excuses" 200 times on a piece of paper. All of this fuelled Nooyi on to achieve a successful career, and she reminds herself of everything she is capable of if things get stressful. "In my heart I said, 'I can do this better than anyone else can, and if everything else fails, they're going to come to me and say, 'Fix it,' because I know I'm that good," she told Business Insider. "Remember, I could be president of India!" 10. Jeff Bezos laughs a lot Lol: Jeff Bezos (Ted S. Warren/AP) "In my particular case, I laugh a lot," said Amazon founder Jeff Bezos in an interview with Academy of Achievement. He also said a large part of feeling stressed is ignoring things that you shouldn't be ignoring. "Stress primarily comes from not taking action over something that you can have some control over," he said. "I find as soon as I identify it, and make the first phone call, or send off the first e-mail message, or whatever it is that we're going to do to start to address that situation — even if it's not solved — the mere fact that we're addressing it dramatically reduces any stress that might come from it." In other words, identify the problem, take control of it, and move forward.

Mass brands, like Pantene, have inadvertently been a part of this pervasive hair bias with a history of advertising showcasing a limited representation of African-American hair styles and textures and promoting long, shiny, smooth hair as the pinnacle of hair health and beauty. Pantene has set out to change this perception and empower all women to embrace their strong and unique hair, because all strong hair is beautiful hair. Now, as part of the next chapter of its “Strong Is Beautiful” story, Pantene launches a new ad that celebrates the heritage, diversity and beauty of African American hair, proving all strong hair is beautiful. Featuring Pantene Brand Ambassador, Jillian Hervey, alongside African-American women of all ages and with a broad representation of hair textures and styles, the ad is a celebration of all strong, beautiful hair. The varieties of striking and varied styles shown are the artistic creation of Pantene Celebrity Stylist, Chuck Amos. “We believe that all strong hair is beautiful, whether it’s straight, or curly, natural or in a protective style,” says Jodi Allen, Vice President of Hair Care for North America at Procter & Gamble. “Pantene has the power and voice to take action, spark conversations, and motivate a change in perceptions. We recognize the importance for African American women to feel confident wearing their hair in any style they choose, and we’re celebrating their strength in doing so.” “Learning to embrace my natural curls has been a hard process for me and I know that many other African American women relate,” says Hervey. “I’m thrilled Pantene is taking a step in the right direction to celebrate all strong, beautiful textures and styles.” Like us on Facebook for the latest news As a part of Pantene’s commitment to better serve the unique hair needs of African American women, the brand created a premium collection of products – Pantene Gold Series – which delivers the strength hair needs to conquer any desired style. With 15 years of research and development to understand the needs of textured hair, the collection of eight care and styling products delights the most discerning hair care and styling consumers. Pantene Gold Series is the Brand’s first hair care collection co-created with a team of African American PhD’s, scientists, stylists and dermatologists, specifically designed to deliver Pro-V Nutrient Blends to provide superior strength and moisture for women with relaxed, natural and transitioning hair. “I love that Pantene is making a commitment to African American women. With the help of the innovative Gold Series Collection, women now have the best products to achieve their desired looks, while having the strongest, healthiest and most beautiful hair,” says Chuck Amos, Pantene Celebrity Stylist.

Startseite > News & Analysen > Finanzmarkt EQS-News: Airopack Initiation of Coverage by Research Dynamics 29.03.2017 - 07:00 | Quelle: DGAP EQS Group-News: Research Dynamics / Schlagwort(e): Research Update Airopack Initiation of Coverage by Research Dynamics 29.03.2017 / 07:00 This report is published by Research Dynamics, an independent research boutique Airopack a game changer in the packaging industry as a planet friendly alternative to traditional aerosol dispensers   A better and effective product for consumers and manufacturers Airopack offers various benefits over aerosol dispensers. These include a consistent dispensing throughout the use of the product unlike aerosol dispensers, which experience a pressure-drop problem once the propellant has been used up. Also, since there are no propellents, the consumers spray (or dispense) only the product. The technology allows for dispensing at all angles, while the transparent packaging enables users to see exactly how much formulation is left in the container. Airopack is cost-effective for manufacturers as it benefits from using low-cost PET materials for the Airopack containers, and the open-neck filling process eliminates the need for using expensive machinery to fill the formulation using valves. We think that the technology presents a win-win situation for both manufacturers and consumers. Addressing the rising environmental concerns The aerosol industry has long been under the watch of environment protection organisations for using harmful chemicals as propellants, resulting in a ban on use of Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) in various countries. The CFCs have since then been replaced by butane and propane, which are considered less hazardous, but companies have always been on a lookout for better alternatives. Airopack bridges this gap by providing a more environment friendly product which has a significantly lower carbon foot-print (-26%) and total environmental footprint (-32%) as compared to aluminium Bag on Valve (BOV) cans. This is mainly because of the use of recyclable PET material in Airopack dispensers besides the application of compressed air instead of chemical-based propellants. These characteristics start to be perceived well by producers and consumers, illustrated by the fact that P&G recently launched a new range of Gillette shave gels exclusively in Airopack dispensers. Financing backed by Apollo The company has a strong financial backing from Apollo Global Management which has an extensive experience of investing in companies in the packaging industry. We believe the strategic partnership with Apollo, which has committed to support Airopack in its long-term growth plans, will assist the company to meet its targets. Valuation Although the company is currently in a ramp-up phase and the planned targets are challenging, we remain optimistic about the growth prospects of Airopack. The company has promising plans and aggressive strategies in place to achieve the specified targets, along with a global financing partner to back it up. Based on a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) approach, we have arrived at a valuation of CHF14.3 per share.

These include a consistent dispensing throughout the use of the product unlike aerosol dispensers, which experience a pressure-drop problem once the propellant has been used up. Also, since there are no propellents, the consumers spray (or dispense) only the product. The technology allows for dispensing at all angles, while the transparent packaging enables users to see exactly how much formulation is left in the container. Airopack is cost-effective for manufacturers as it benefits from using low-cost PET materials for the Airopack containers, and the open-neck filling process eliminates the need for using expensive machinery to fill the formulation using valves. We think that the technology presents a win-win situation for both manufacturers and consumers. *Addressing the rising environmental concerns* The aerosol industry has long been under the watch of environment protection organisations for using harmful chemicals as propellants, resulting in a ban on use of Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) in various countries. The CFCs have since then been replaced by butane and propane, which are considered less hazardous, but companies have always been on a lookout for better alternatives. Airopack bridges this gap by providing a more environment friendly product which has a significantly lower carbon foot-print (-26%) and total environmental footprint (-32%) as compared to aluminium Bag on Valve (BOV) cans. This is mainly because of the use of recyclable PET material in Airopack dispensers besides the application of compressed air instead of chemical-based propellants. These characteristics start to be perceived well by producers and consumers, illustrated by the fact that P&G recently launched a new range of Gillette shave gels exclusively in Airopack dispensers. *Financing backed by Apollo* The company has a strong financial backing from Apollo Global Management which has an extensive experience of investing in companies in the packaging industry. We believe the strategic partnership with Apollo, which has committed to support Airopack in its long-term growth plans, will assist the company to meet its targets. *Valuation* Although the company is currently in a ramp-up phase and the planned targets are challenging, we remain optimistic about the growth prospects of Airopack. The company has promising plans and aggressive strategies in place to achieve the specified targets, along with a global financing partner to back it up. Based on a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) approach, we have arrived at a valuation of CHF14.3 per share.

The company also conceded that it’s failed to reach another goal set around the same time: to double the amount of products and services sourced from women-owned companies outside of the country. Why employers' efforts to support pregnant workers can backfire Read more The mixed success shows the challenges for big companies to narrow the gaping gender gap. While Walmart’s initiative has doubled the amount of money it spends with women-owned suppliers, it’s still only 2% of the retailer’s global purchases. Yet that’s twice the global average retailers spend with women-owned businesses. The retail giant launched the Global Women’s Economic Empowerment Initiative in 2011 to increase the number of its women-owned suppliers. The initiative also provided training and other services to female entrepreneurs. As the world’s largest retailer, Walmart’s decision to take on gender equality or other sustainability work carries a significant weight among its competitors and suppliers. Promoting women-owned business reflects not just the company’s values, its executives said. It’s also good for business, said Kathleen McLaughlin, chief sustainability officer for Walmart and president of the Walmart Foundation, which spearheaded the initiative. “We’ve found that products from women-led companies have better sell-through rates and better margins,” McLaughlin said. She believes women entrepreneurs do well because they tend to get involved in businesses – especially food, apparel and toys – that can make use of their personal experiences. Walmart’s finding corresponds with data compiled by American Express, which shows that the number of women-owned businesses in the US has grown 45% from 2007 to 2016, compared with a 9% increase in businesses owned by men. During that same time period, women-owned businesses saw 35% higher revenue increases than men-owned businesses. The retail giant now buys products and services such as accounting and consulting from more than 1500 women-owned businesses worldwide, McLaughlin said. The company also has given out $134m of grants for training to 1 million women in its global supply chain and outside of it. The initiative taught some good lessons for Walmart. For example, the company underestimated the breadth of the challenges women entrepreneurs face in certain countries, McLaughlin said. It has managed to double the amount of money it spends with women-owned businesses in Mexico, but has otherwise struggled to increase international purchases from women-led companies. “In China, for example, it’s taken us years just to identify the women-led businesses,” McLaughling said, because, she explained, there was no private or government data to help with the research. “In Japan, women haven’t traditionally been encouraged to start businesses, so we had to begin with pitch contests there to inspire women to participate.” The company also has learned that creating a successful work environment for women involves more than just training female executives. “About halfway through the factory program we realized we had to train men, too, to show them that they might need to change how they’re communicating with the women on their staffs,” McLaughlin said. The struggle by large companies to close the gender gap internally or among their partners isn’t surprising, said Barbara Annis, co-author of the forthcoming book, Results at the Top. Initiatives like Walmart’s, although well intended, usually don’t do enough to reduce gender disparity, she said. “Companies tend to say, ‘Let’s create programs for women or networks or training’, and all of that stuff does have an impact on engagement and feeling valued, so in that sense it’s great,” Annis said. “But it has zero correlation to advancement. And that’s where a lot of times these sorts of initiatives end up being window dressing that has very little lasting impact.” McLaughlin said Walmart understands the difficulties of creating a lasting change and seeks to intensify its effort to support women business leaders by asking its large, male-led suppliers to report on the gender makeup of employees on their key, internal teams. “We didn’t set any quotas or requirements, we just asked them to share the information, and just through that we saw the diversity of those teams increase,” she said. Risky business: do companies pay a price for expressing political views? Read more Walmart also announced Wednesday that it will join eight other multinational companies – Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Exxon-Mobil, General Mills, Campbell’s Soup, Procter & Gamble, Johnson & Johnson and Mondoleez – to commit to sourcing more from women-owned companies. These companies plan to report their progress each year to the Women’s Business Enterprise National Council, a nonprofit in Washington DC that validates companies that are owned or operated by women, given that government agencies and the private sector run programs to promote women-owned businesses. The council will use the data to produce an annual report. McLaughlin said she hopes other companies will join the initiative as well. Ariela Balk, founder and CEO of Smart & Sexy, a lingerie company in New York City, mentored women as part of Walmart’s initiative. She noted that the program opened the door, but it wasn’t meant to guarantee success. “No one is asking for any special privileges and advantages,” said Balk, who has been selling her products to Walmart for more than a decade. “Business is tough. The customer votes and the best product wins.” Topics Guardian sustainable business Values-led business Women in the boardroom Walmart Retail industry Gender Entrepreneurs news Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Reuse this content View all comments > Order by newest oldest recommendations Show 25 25 50 100 All Threads collapsed expanded unthreaded Loading comments… Trouble loading?
