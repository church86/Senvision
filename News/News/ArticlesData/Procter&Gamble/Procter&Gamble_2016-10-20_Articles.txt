Published on October 20, 2016. 'On every part of the canvas, craft matters,' Procter & Gamble Chief Brand Officer Marc Pritchard said ad the ANA Masters of Marketing conference on Thursday. Credit: Clarion Pictures Most Popular Too many marketers, Procter & Gamble Co. included, have gotten caught in a content "crap trap," and one way out may be to start treating agencies better, according to Procter & Gamble Co. Chief Brand Officer Marc Pritchard. Mr. Pritchard has talked about P&G's crap-to-craft journey a few times this year, including at Cannes. But a new wrinkle in his Thursday keynote address to the Association of National Advertisers Masters of Marketing Conference in Orlando was an acknowledgment that marketers generally, and P&G specifically, need to let up on pressuring agencies. What sounded like a peace offering may take on added weight given that Mr. Pritchard, now vice chairman of the ANA, is expected to be announced as chairman on Friday, succeeding former Subway CMO Tony Pace. Both have served in their roles the past two years, a period after which the ANA board typically elevates the vice chair. The ANA has had an increasingly contentious relationship with agencies -- particularly media agencies -- over the past 18 months as it probed alleged undisclosed rebates and other non-transparent dealings in the U.S. Mr. Pritchard was specifically addressing issues with creative agencies, given the focus of his talk on "Raising the Creative Bar." But he said it's time to lower pressure on agencies – which has included P&G cutting its agency and production fees the past two year by $570 million to $1.4 billion. Related Stories ANA CEO: 'Marketers Must Take Their Industry Back' Big Hike in Ad Spending Helps P&G Beat Expectations, but Agency Cuts Continue P&G's Pritchard to Agencies: Your Complexity Not Our Problem "Let's also remember that advertising is a creative business, and our agencies are made up of people," he said. "The last few years have been admittedly tough on agencies, P&G included. And it's time to turn the page. The negative narrative needs to stop, because the people in our agencies are good people, the ones who do good work to create magic together with all of us. Let's tap into all that positive human energy to create the most abundant explosion of creativity the world has ever seen." Improving creativity requires craft that "belongs in the hands of serious professionals," Mr. Pritchard said. "Don't ever accept mediocrity. Don't be seduced into the crap trap of just getting something out. On every part of the canvas, craft matters." Doing good creative work also requires time, he said. "And we have a problem, because we're spending too much of our time on measurement of advertising vs. the quality. We're fiddling with measurement debates while consumers are blocking our ads. Measurement is not going to make crappy advertising better." That line generated applause from among what ANA CEO Bob Liodice said is a record 2,700 registrants this year, including 1,500 ANA marketer members. But Mr. Pritchard said he hasn't quit being concerned about measurement, particularly on the media side, as he shifted the transparency discussion toward media companies rather than agencies. "Our patience has run out," Mr. Pritchard said. "It's time to insist that all media partners adopt common, transparent measurement standards and accept third-party verification." Realistically, key players, including Google and Facebook, which dominate digital media, have bowed to marketer demands for third-party measurement in the past year. It was why P&G and others who have outside firms measuring viewership, such as Unilever, weren't surprised by Facebook's recent revelation that it had been overstating average video view times. On creative measurement, while P&G certainly hasn't abandoned copy testing, Mr. Pritchard said he favors a different test for deciding to proceed with work, which is "whether it makes my spine tingle." If it does, it should at least get further development, he said. So the examples he raised from the crap side of the ledger -- such as a Pantene social-media post with a rather unappetizing photo of enchiladas and rice, and a Pepto Bismol video about a boy raised by goats that didn't provide a clue about the brand involved until after the 4-minute mark -- are things he hopes are in the rearview mirror. He expects to see more from the craft side, including a variety of funny or tear-jerking work for Gillette, Tide, Ariel and SK-II.

Breakdown of Q3 2016 revenue by region   EUR  Revenue Organic  Reported Million Q3 2016 Q3 2015 growth growth Europe 643 625 +7.6% +2.9% North America 1,254 1,292 -4.0% -2.9% Asia Pacific 261 260 -0.4% +0.4% Latin America 89 87 +13.1% +2.3% Middle East & Africa 68 61 +4.1% +11.5% Total 2,315 2,325 +0.2% -0.4%     2 - REVENUE AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2016   In the first nine months of 2016, Publicis Groupe's consolidated revenue totaled 7,068 million euro, up 2.9% from 6,867 million euro for the corresponding period in 2015.  Exchange rates adversely affected revenue by 150 million euro, i.e. the equivalent of 2.2% of revenue for the first nine months of 2015.  Net acquisitions contributed 222 million euro during the first nine months, i.e. the equivalent of 3.2% of 2015 revenue for the same period.  Growth at constant exchange rates was +5.2%, and organic growth stood at +1.9% at September 30, 2016.   Breakdown of revenue at September 30, 2016 by region   EUR  Revenue Organic  Reported Million 9M 2016 9M 2015 growth growth Europe 1,992 1,894 +6.2% +5.2% North America 3,874 3,767 -0.5% +2.8% Asia Pacific 764 746 +2.9% +2.4% Latin America 241 278 +5.1% -13.3% Middle East & Africa 197 182 +1.0% +8.2% Total 7,068 6,867 +1.9% +2.9%   Europe's revenue grew by 5.2%.  When the impact of acquisitions and exchange rates is factored out, organic growth stands at +6.2%, with a strong performance in France (above 5%), and strong momentum in Germany and Italy (growth of close to 10%), helped by a more conducive macroeconomic environment.  The situation was volatile in Russia where growth stood at more than 9% at September 30 after growth of almost 5% in the first half year.  The UK has picked up sharply and recorded growth of almost 5% (including +7% in the third quarter). Digital continued to post high growth in Europe generally (+13.9%)   North America reported growth of 2.8% at September 30, though organic growth was -0.5% (organic growth was -4.0% in the third quarter).  This downturn was attributable to media subsequent to the loss of certain media accounts in the 2015 media palooza, as well as the end of several digital projects at a time when new projects have not reached their full growth potential yet.   Asia Pacific reported growth of 2.4% (organic growth of 2.9%), with especially satisfactory performance levels in China and India.   Latin America was down 13.3% on a reported basis mainly due to exchange rates as this area recorded positive organic growth of 5.1%.  Brazil picked up to record strong revenue growth of 10.9% in the third quarter, and Mexico continued to boast high growth (+20.5% in Q3 after 11.5% in the first half year).    The Middle East & Africa achieved reported growth of 8.2% and organic growth of 1.0%.   Breakdown of revenue at September 30, 2016 by region: digital and analog     Europe North America Asia Pacific Latin America Middle East & Africa Total Digital +13.9% +0.3% +19.2% +3.2% +7.8% +4.9% Analog -0.2% -1.8% -4.7% +5.5% -0.9% -1.3% Total +6.2% -0.5% +2.9% +5.1% +1.0% +1.9%   The Groupe's growth continued to be driven by its digital activities (organic growth of +4.9%), with double-digit growth in Europe and Asia Pacific.  North America only grew by +0.3% due to the media account losses of 2015 and the end of several digital projects when new projects have been recorded a slow start.  Despite the Q3 slowdown of organic growth that can be ascribed to the very strong comparable period in 2015, Sapient continues to be buoyed posting a satisfactory growth rate at September 30.  It should also be pointed out that analog activities continued to decline.   3 - NET DEBT   At September 30, 2016, net debt amounted to 2,452 million euro, compared with 1,872 million euro at December 31, 2015.  The Groupe's average net debt at September 30, 2016 was 2,443 million euro after 2,305 million euro at September 30, 2015.  It should be recalled that the Sapient acquisition was completed on February 6, 2015.     4 - HIGHLIGHTS AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2016   4.1 - Transformation   During the first half of 2016, Publicis Groupe ended the traditional structure of the holding company and silos and has reorganized its operations by putting clients at the heart of the Groupe. Thus, clients have access to all the Groupe's capabilities ("The Power of One") to meet their needs in commerce, marketing or transformation.   The Groupe should reap the benefits of this organization in the forthcoming quarters.  The initial results are very promising with accounts gained that include Wal-Mart, P&G's home care brands, Asda, GSK, HPE and USAA.   4.2 - Digital    Activities in digital and technology now represent 54% of Groupe revenue. The Sapient integration is going well and its performance is very satisfactory. Razorfish, which suffered headwinds for several quarters, recorded in the third quarter its best quarter ever in terms of new business in its history thanks to the support of Sapient and "The Power of One".   4.3 - Groupe commitment to start-ups   -    Viva Technology Paris. In conjunction with Groupe les Echos, Publicis Groupe staged a global event in Paris bringing together start-ups and the main stakeholders in the digital environment.  This rendez-vous, held from June 30 to July 2, attracted 5,000 start-ups, dozens of major industrial groups and investors, and included over 300 conferences with the top names in the global high-tech sector.  With over 45,000 visitors in three days, Viva Technology proved a tremendous success and underscored the pre-eminent place of Publicis Groupe in the global digital economy.  This event should be staged every year from now on. -    Publicis90. On the occasion of its 90th anniversary, Publicis Groupe launched a project named Publicis90. The idea was to provide 90 projects or start-ups with financial aid and the support of the Groupe's digital experts.  After an initial phase of stringent selection over a period of several months, the winners were selected from among the 3,500 contestants from 130 countries, and received their awards at a ceremony held during Viva Technology.   4.4 - Global partnership with Tencent   Publicis Groupe has entered into a strategic partnership with Tencent, the internet giant that operates the most popular social and media platforms in China.  This partnership is a first-of-its-kind collaboration between a global communications group and China's biggest internet company.  It spans the Groupe's three solutions hubs (Publicis Media, Publicis Communications and Publicis.Sapient) as well as Tencent's eleven product lines.  This agreement will cement the groups' relationship at a global level while providing clients with access to all Tencent's innovative solutions via a unique, borderless approach built on three pillars: -    a tremendous capacity for innovation: through this partnership, Publicis Groupe and Tencent will launch an incubation facility in China called "Drugstore".  The goal is to curate, invest in and cultivate the start-ups of the future.  This will provide breakthrough offerings to our clients in data and ad tech, as well as across new virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) platforms; -    an exceptional source of data: Publicis Groupe will have access to digital behavior databases that will benefit its clients through improved programmatic offerings and cross-screen planning capabilities; -    innovative web content: the two companies will partner on the creation and co-investment of web-native content to drive unique content opportunities and new content models for key clients.   4.5 - Acquisitions   -    MercerBell is a leading Australian agency in the field of customer experience. MercerBell is specialized in CRM and digital strategy, creativity, content and technology, and will be integrated into Saatchi & Saatchi. This agency, which was founded in 1999, has a team of 65 professionals and a customer base that includes Toyota, Foxtel, Quantas, BT, Allianz and ASX. -    Vertiba, the Salesforce partner, is specialized in marketing solutions.  Founded in 2010, Vertiba is headquartered in Boulder, Colorado.  Vertiba's skills will be integrated into the Publicis.Sapient platform. -    Seven Seconds, the London (UK) based e-commerce and digital specialist, was founded in 2013 and will be integrated into BBH.  Its main clients are British Airways, Barclays, Boots, Tesco Retail and Tesco Bank. -    Venus Communications is one of the leading public relations agencies in Vietnam.  Venus has been integrated into the MSL brand, which in turn is part of Publicis One in Vietnam.  Over the last 10 years, Venus and MSL have worked together successfully on numerous assignments. The agency, which was founded in 1998, has over 40 employees and a prestigious client portfolio that includes MasterCard, FedEx, Rolls Royce, BAT, Mead Johnson and Sanofi.  -    Troyka Group, in which Publicis Groupe has taken a stake, is West Africa's first fully-integrated communications services group.  The Troyka group is comprised of six agencies, i.e. Insight Communications, The Thinkshop, All Seasons Media, Media Perspectives, The Quadrant Company, and Hotsauce.  Starting out with Insight Communications in 1980, the Troyka group now has 300 employees over six agencies across the entire region.  The Troyka agencies work with prestigious international brands such as Heineken, Shell, Samsung, Unilever, Google, P&G, Microsoft, Ford and Axa, as well as with national brands including Oando, Nestoil, Africa Investor, Jagal, and Olam.  Publicis Groupe has been investing regularly in Africa in recent years, in view of the high growth potential of this market.  By way of this equity investment, Publicis Groupe will use Troyka to launch its network in Nigeria, thereby creating a powerful communications entity that will have a competitive edge in all skill sets in West Africa.     5 - OUTLOOK   The Groupe's transformation is the most radical ever imagined in its sector.  It is being carried out to meet clients' new requirements in selling their products or in their own transformation.  Publicis Groupe has abolished the notion of holding company with silo-type operating structures.  The results to date, obtained with the implementation of the new "Power of One" organization, have been very promising, with accounts gained including Wal-Mart, Asda, P&G's home care products, GSK, HPE, Coty and USAA.   Publicis Groupe is confirming its previous guidance for 2016 in spite of the 250 to 300 basis point negative impact on the growth of the second half of 2016.  On top, the fourth quarter is usually characterized by uncertainty surrounding advertisers' budget management.  We approach 2017 cautiously given the lack of visibility owing to elections in the US, France and Germany, and the consequences of "Brexit", not just for the UK for also for the rest of Europe.    The Management Board will be proposing that the 2018 objective of a 42% payout (compared with 39.5% in 2015) be brought forward in respect of financial 2016.       *         * *     Disclaimer   Certain information contained in this document, other than historical information, may constitute forward-looking statements or unaudited financial forecasts.  These forward-looking statements and forecasts are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected.  They are presented as at the date of this document and, other than as required by applicable law, Publicis Groupe does not assume any obligation to update them to reflect new information or events or for any other reason.  Publicis Groupe urges you carefully to consider the risk factors that may affect its business, as set out in the 2015 Registration Document filed with the French Autorité des Marchés Financiers (AMF) and which is available on the website of Publicis Groupe (www.publicisgroupe.com), including an unfavorable economic climate, an extremely competitive market sector, the possibility that our clients could seek to terminate their contracts with us at short notice, the fact that a substantial part of the Group's revenue is derived from certain key clients, conflicts of interest between advertisers active in the same sector, the Group's dependence on its directors and employees, laws and regulations which apply to the Group's business, legal action brought against the Group based on allegations that certain of the Group's commercials are deceptive or misleading or that the products of certain clients are defective, the strategy of growing through acquisitions, the depreciation of goodwill and assets listed on the Group's balance sheet, the Group's presence in emerging markets, the difficulty of ensuring internal controls, exposure to liquidity risk, a drop in the Group's credit rating and exposure to the risks of financial markets.     About Publicis Groupe - The Power of One Publicis Groupe [Euronext Paris FR0000130577, CAC 40] is a global leader in marketing, communication, and digital transformation. Active across the entire value chain, from consulting to creation, and production, Publicis Groupe offers its clients a transversal, unified and fluid model allowing them access to all the Groupe's tools and expertise around the world. Publicis Groupe is organized across four Solutions hubs: Publicis Communications, Publicis Media, Publicis.Sapient and Publicis Health .

Published on October 21, 2016. Most Popular Procter & Gamble Co. Chief Brand Officer Marc Pritchard took over as chairman of the Association of National Advertisers officially on Friday, outlining his priorities at the group's Masters of Marketing conference in Orlando. McDonald's CMO Deborah Wahl takes over for Mr. Pritchard as vice chair, putting her in line to likely chair the group starting in 2018. And the ANA elected a slate of new and returning board members, with the new group including Maryam Banikarim, global CMO of Hyatt Corp.; Suzy Deering, CMO-North America of eBay; Melisa Goldie, CMO of Calvin Klein; Maggie Chan Jones, CMO of SAP; Denise Karkos, CMO, TD Ameritrade; and Karen Walker, CMO of Cisco Systems. In a video interview with Advertising Age, Mr. Pritchard outlines his priorities for the ANA. And he looks at why "less is more" when it comes to content for P&G and for advertisers broadly. ~ ~ ~ CORRECTION: An earlier version of the story incorrectly listed Melisa Goldie as CMO of SAP. She is CMO of Calvin Klein. Another new board member, Maggie Chan Jones, CMO of SAP, was omitted.

Marc Pritchard, Global Brand Officer at Procter & Gamble, discussed this subject at the Association of National Advertisers' (ANA) 2016 Masters of Marketing Conference. And he suggested that the manufacturer of Tide detergent, Pampers diapers and Crest toothpaste – and, indeed, the world's biggest advertiser – is currently forced to expend too much energy on issues surrounding metrics. "Frankly, our patience has run out. It's time to insist that all media partners adopt common, transparent measurement standards and accept third-party verification," said Pritchard. (For more details, read Warc's exclusive report: P&G seeks to end the measurement debate – for the sake of creativity.) Expanding on this argument, he suggested that the outsized effort required to address measurement reduces the time available to generate breakthrough creative. "Beautiful craft requires time. And we have a problem, because we're spending too much of our time on [the] measurement of advertising versus the quality," Pritchard said. The need to move on from insular debates about metrics, and instead focus on delivering ads worthy of consumer attention, is brought into stark relief by several trends observable in the digital ecosystem. Examples of these shifts include the surging popularity of ad-blocking software, as well as the habit of fast-forwarding through TV commercials and skipping pre-roll messages whenever possible. "We're fiddling with measurement debates while consumers are blocking our ads. Measurement is not going to make crappy advertising better," Pritchard reported. "We need to stop wasting time on measurement transactions, and invest in what's really important, which is elevating the craft of our work." And focusing on craft, he continued, can help marketers foster much deeper relationships with consumers. "The consumers that we serve deserve our very best, and it is the key to unlocking growth."

In celebration of 25 years of Habitat’s ReStore program, Swiffer will donate $1 for every transaction at the secondhand outlets until the end of October. “Since 2013, P&G and Swiffer have been strong supporters of Habitat for Humanity Canada and we couldn’t be happier to partner again to help celebrate this landmark anniversary for Habitat ReStore,” said Corinne Durieu, communications manager from Procter & Gamble Canada. “We encourage Canadians to visit their local ReStore and take part in this promotion, which is a step towards ensuring all Canadians have a safe and affordable place to call home.” With nearly 100 locations across Canada, including 3311 Oak St. here in Saanich, Habitat for Humanity’s ReStores are home and building supply stores that accept and resell quality new and used building supplies, home furnishing, appliances and décor. Habitat’s ReStores accept donations of secondhand, overstocked and discontinued items, as well as salvageable building materials donated by manufacturers, stores, contractors and individuals. Proceeds fund Habitat for Humanity operations and homebuilding projects in communities across the country. “Supporting Habitat for Humanity’s ReStore means more families are able to partner with Habitat for Humanity, building strength, stability and self-reliance,” said Mark Rodgers, president and CEO of Habitat for Humanity Canada. “We’re so grateful that Swiffer has come on board to help us celebrate the 25th anniversary of Habitat’s ReStore and that this promotion will encourage more Canadians to get out to their local store.” To provide additional incentive, Swiffer is also giving out a free Swiffer Duster with all purchases while supplies last. The funds generated through this campaign will be used towards Habitat for Humanity Victoria’s builds in the local community.   It’s estimated that Habitat’s ReStores in Canada have been directly responsible for the construction of 1,200 Habitat for Humanity homes and in excess of 250,000 tonnes of material being diverted from landfills.     We encourage an open exchange of ideas on this story's topic, but we ask you to follow our guidelines for respecting community standards.

Organic growth for the period was 1.9%. Unsurprisingly, growth decelerated in the third quarter to 0.2%. As announced, the third and fourth quarters of the year are the most significantly impacted by accounts lost in the media palooza. This was compounded by projects recently completed at Razorfish that will only be relayed by new projects in the fourth quarter, but that will produce their full effect in 2017. Therefore, on the geographical standpoint, North America showed a sharp downturn (-4.0%) while Europe reported a strong growth (+7.6%). As anticipated, it is in 2017 that we will reap the full benefits of the new "Power of One organization we are implementing. The initial results are already there, as evidenced by the large accounts awarded to us by advertisers such as Wal-Mart, GSK, HPE, Coty and USAA. It is worth noting "The Power of One" has been very successful at Razorfish which experienced the best ever quarter for new business. Regarding the fourth quarter, like every year, economic uncertainties can result in marketing investments becoming the adjustment variable in the equation towards the end of the year. We have nonetheless confidence in our ability to reach our objectives, which is why the Management Board has moved that the 42% payout ratio we had been targeting for 2018 be decided as of 2016. As indicated quite some time ago, the formal process of identifying my successor will commence in November, leading to a decision to be taken by the Supervisory Board, no later than at its meeting of February 2017. » 1  Q3 2016 REVENUE Publicis Groupes consolidated revenue for the third quarter of 2016 was 2,315 million euro, 0.4% below the 2,325 million euro reported for the corresponding period in 2015. Exchange rates impacted revenue negatively by 45 million euro, i.e. the equivalent of 1.9% of Q3 2015 revenue. Net acquisitions contributed 31 million euro to revenue in Q3 2016, i.e. the equivalent of 1.3% of Q3 2015 revenue. Growth at constant exchange rates was +1.5%. Organic growth was +0.2% in the third quarter, below the growth rate at June 30 due to the more significant impact of media accounts lost in the 2015 media palooza  an impact that will remain high in Q4  and to the end of several digital projects when new projects have not reached their full growth potential yet.

Exchange rates adversely affected revenue by 150 million euro, i.e. the equivalent of 2.2% of revenue for the first nine months of 2015. Net acquisitions contributed 222 million euro during the first nine months, i.e. the equivalent of 3.2% of 2015 revenue for the same period. Growth at constant exchange rates was +5.2%, and organic growth stood at +1.9% at September 30, 2016.

When the impact of acquisitions and exchange rates is factored out, organic growth stands at +6.2%, with a strong performance in France (above 5%), and strong momentum in Germany and Italy (growth of close to 10%), helped by a more conducive macroeconomic environment. The situation was volatile in Russia where growth stood at more than 9% at September 30 after growth of almost 5% in the first half year. The UK has picked up sharply and recorded growth of almost 5% (including +7% in the third quarter). Digital continued to post high growth in Europe generally (+13.9%) North America reported growth of 2.8% at September 30, though organic growth was -0.5% (organic growth was -4.0% in the third quarter). This downturn was attributable to media subsequent to the loss of certain media accounts in the 2015 media palooza, as well as the end of several digital projects at a time when new projects have not reached their full growth potential yet. Asia Pacific reported growth of 2.4% (organic growth of 2.9%), with especially satisfactory performance levels in China and India. Latin America was down 13.3% on a reported basis mainly due to exchange rates as this area recorded positive organic growth of 5.1%. Brazil picked up to record strong revenue growth of 10.9% in the third quarter, and Mexico continued to boast high growth (+20.5% in Q3 after 11.5% in the first half year). The Middle East & Africa achieved reported growth of 8.2% and organic growth of 1.0%. Breakdown of revenue at September 30, 2016 by region: digital and analog   Europe   North   Asia   Latin   Middle East   Total         America   Pacific   America   & Africa     Digital   +13.9%   +0.3%   +19.2%   +3.2%   +7.8%   +4.9% Analog   -0.2%   -1.8%   -4.7%   +5.5%   -0.9%   -1.3% Total   +6.2%   -0.5%   +2.9%   +5.1%   +1.0%   +1.9% The Groupes growth continued to be driven by its digital activities (organic growth of +4.9%), with double-digit growth in Europe and Asia Pacific. North America only grew by +0.3% due to the media account losses of 2015 and the end of several digital projects when new projects have been recorded a slow start. Despite the Q3 slowdown of organic growth that can be ascribed to the very strong comparable period in 2015, Sapient continues to be buoyed posting a satisfactory growth rate at September 30. It should also be pointed out that analog activities continued to decline. 3  NET DEBT At September 30, 2016, net debt amounted to 2,452 million euro, compared with 1,872 million euro at December 31, 2015. The Groupes average net debt at September 30, 2016 was 2,443 million euro after 2,305 million euro at September 30, 2015. It should be recalled that the Sapient acquisition was completed on February 6, 2015. 4  HIGHLIGHTS AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 4.1 - Transformation During the first half of 2016, Publicis Groupe ended the traditional structure of the holding company and silos and has reorganized its operations by putting clients at the heart of the Groupe. Thus, clients have access to all the Groupe's capabilities ("The Power of One) to meet their needs in commerce, marketing or transformation. The Groupe should reap the benefits of this organization in the forthcoming quarters. The initial results are very promising with accounts gained that include Wal-Mart, P&Gs home care brands, Asda, GSK, HPE and USAA. 4.2  Digital Activities in digital and technology now represent 54% of Groupe revenue. The Sapient integration is going well and its performance is very satisfactory. Razorfish, which suffered headwinds for several quarters, recorded in the third quarter its best quarter ever in terms of new business in its history thanks to the support of Sapient and "The Power of One. 4.3  Groupe commitment to start-ups - Viva Technology Paris. In conjunction with Groupe les Echos, Publicis Groupe staged a global event in Paris bringing together start-ups and the main stakeholders in the digital environment. This rendez-vous, held from June 30 to July 2, attracted 5,000 start-ups, dozens of major industrial groups and investors, and included over 300 conferences with the top names in the global high-tech sector. With over 45,000 visitors in three days, Viva Technology proved a tremendous success and underscored the pre-eminent place of Publicis Groupe in the global digital economy. This event should be staged every year from now on. - Publicis90. On the occasion of its 90th anniversary, Publicis Groupe launched a project named Publicis90. The idea was to provide 90 projects or start-ups with financial aid and the support of the Groupes digital experts. After an initial phase of stringent selection over a period of several months, the winners were selected from among the 3,500 contestants from 130 countries, and received their awards at a ceremony held during Viva Technology. 4.4  Global partnership with Tencent Publicis Groupe has entered into a strategic partnership with Tencent, the internet giant that operates the most popular social and media platforms in China. This partnership is a first-of-its-kind collaboration between a global communications group and Chinas biggest internet company. It spans the Groupes three solutions hubs (Publicis Media, Publicis Communications and Publicis.Sapient) as well as Tencents eleven product lines. This agreement will cement the groups relationship at a global level while providing clients with access to all Tencents innovative solutions via a unique, borderless approach built on three pillars: - a tremendous capacity for innovation: through this partnership, Publicis Groupe and Tencent will launch an incubation facility in China called "Drugstore. The goal is to curate, invest in and cultivate the start-ups of the future. This will provide breakthrough offerings to our clients in data and ad tech, as well as across new virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) platforms; - an exceptional source of data: Publicis Groupe will have access to digital behavior databases that will benefit its clients through improved programmatic offerings and cross-screen planning capabilities; - innovative web content: the two companies will partner on the creation and co-investment of web-native content to drive unique content opportunities and new content models for key clients. 4.5 - Acquisitions - MercerBell is a leading Australian agency in the field of customer experience. MercerBell is specialized in CRM and digital strategy, creativity, content and technology, and will be integrated into Saatchi & Saatchi. This agency, which was founded in 1999, has a team of 65 professionals and a customer base that includes Toyota, Foxtel, Quantas, BT, Allianz and ASX. - Vertiba, the Salesforce partner, is specialized in marketing solutions.

Its main clients are British Airways, Barclays, Boots, Tesco Retail and Tesco Bank. - Venus Communications is one of the leading public relations agencies in Vietnam.

The agency, which was founded in 1998, has over 40 employees and a prestigious client portfolio that includes MasterCard, FedEx, Rolls Royce, BAT, Mead Johnson and Sanofi. - Troyka Group, in which Publicis Groupe has taken a stake, is West Africas first fully-integrated communications services group. The Troyka group is comprised of six agencies, i.e. Insight Communications, The Thinkshop, All Seasons Media, Media Perspectives, The Quadrant Company, and Hotsauce. Starting out with Insight Communications in 1980, the Troyka group now has 300 employees over six agencies across the entire region. The Troyka agencies work with prestigious international brands such as Heineken, Shell, Samsung, Unilever, Google, P&G, Microsoft, Ford and Axa, as well as with national brands including Oando, Nestoil, Africa Investor, Jagal, and Olam. Publicis Groupe has been investing regularly in Africa in recent years, in view of the high growth potential of this market. By way of this equity investment, Publicis Groupe will use Troyka to launch its network in Nigeria, thereby creating a powerful communications entity that will have a competitive edge in all skill sets in West Africa. 5 - OUTLOOK The Groupes transformation is the most radical ever imagined in its sector. It is being carried out to meet clients new requirements in selling their products or in their own transformation. Publicis Groupe has abolished the notion of holding company with silo-type operating structures. The results to date, obtained with the implementation of the new "Power of One organization, have been very promising, with accounts gained including Wal-Mart, Asda, P&Gs home care products, GSK, HPE, Coty and USAA. Publicis Groupe is confirming its previous guidance for 2016 in spite of the 250 to 300 basis point negative impact on the growth of the second half of 2016. On top, the fourth quarter is usually characterized by uncertainty surrounding advertisers budget management. We approach 2017 cautiously given the lack of visibility owing to elections in the US, France and Germany, and the consequences of "Brexit, not just for the UK for also for the rest of Europe. The Management Board will be proposing that the 2018 objective of a 42% payout (compared with 39.5% in 2015) be brought forward in respect of financial 2016. * * * Disclaimer Certain information contained in this document, other than historical information, may constitute forward-looking statements or unaudited financial forecasts.

Published on October 21, 2016. Most Popular Tony Pace's two-year reign as chairman of the Association of National Advertisers ended this week when Procter & Gamble Co. Chief Brand Officer Marc Pritchard took over the lead role. Ad Age caught up with Mr. Pace at the ANA's Masters of Marketing conference in Orlando this week to get his perspective on his two-year term, during which the ANA drew headlines for taking on media rebates and other transparency issues in media buying and selling. "I think we made some real good progress there but I think there is a lot more to be done" on transparency, he said. With the issue consuming much of the ANA's attention, Mr. Pace said he regrets not being able to spend more time addressing the industry's training and development issues. Closing the talent gap is among the priorities of the ANA's CMO-led "Masters Circle" leadership alliance program that was announced in Orlando. That includes working with the ANA's educational foundation and other organizations to "ensure that university students are encouraged to consider careers in advertising and marketing," according to priorities outlined this week. Mr. Pace -- the former Subway CMO who now runs a consultancy called Cerebral Graffiti -- addressed the transparency issue and more in a video interview: In this article: Agencies Regulation Special Report: ANA Annual Meeting 2016 Become a Member Register Now Renew Membership Benefits Datacenter Advertising Age     Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Instagram YouTube Tumblr Copyright © 1994-2016 Crain Communications Privacy Statement Terms of Use About Us Advertise Reprints Contact Us AD AGE Creativity LookBook Datacenter Resources Events Jobs On Campus Site by AREA 17 x Scroll to Continue

The in-depth report, underwritten by Eyeview, surveyed more than 200 senior brand marketers, including interviews with leaders from P&G, Honda, Clorox and Bank of America, highlights how brands can harness the power of video to reach consumers and influence their in-store buying decisions. The study’s most noteworthy findings indicate that to demonstrate real ROI from video marketing campaigns, brands must embrace a one-to-one model instead of one-to-many. With this approach, brands stand not only to gain foot-traffic into their stores and drive sales, but they are able to demonstrate ROI directly from their video campaigns. “When it comes to digital video advertising, marketers have traditionally relied on the medium to deliver branding objectives with less of a focus on sales goals. However, the following research reveals that digital video is at its inflection point of the adoption curve, moving from a branding to a sales tool,” said Jim Spaeth, former President of The Advertising Research Foundation (ARF) and co-author of the study (pictured top left). “Digital video has strong financial returns and unique capabilities to drive sales while still building brands. Indications are that this medium is poised and ready to mature in the next 1-2 years.” Through in-depth interviews with marketers from today’s leading auto, CPG, retail and travel brands, the report highlights the efforts companies are making to embrace this vision, wins they have recorded as a result and what hurdles continue to hold them back. According to the study, 65 percent of marketers say that digital video is growing in importance for driving offline sales. However, that near-future view contrasts with the current state, where a smaller 42 percent of advertisers see digital video as superior to other leading media. Marketers today are more likely to view digital video as a branding tool with more than half seeing it as superior for building brand awareness and favorability, telling their brand’s story and connecting with consumers emotionally. “The future of marketing is about business outcomes, not media outputs. Marketers now can deliver on the long-awaited promise of marrying the engagement and appeal of television-quality video advertising with data and targeting capabilities in order to drive sales,” said Oren Harnevo, CEO and Co-founder, Eyeview. “Where before marketers always had to choose between promoting the brand or making a sale, today, video can do more than branding and drive significant incremental offline sales for clients across all screens, television, desktop, mobile and social.” Additional key findings from the report include: Marketers’ Perceptions of Digital Video Are Shifting. The study revealed a disconnect between marketers’ perceptions and their experience with digital video — 87 percent reported enjoying positive ROIs with the medium. Evidence Shows Strong Potential for Digital Video to Drive ROI. A substantial proportion of marketers, 40 percent, already see digital video as a sales driver while 28 percent of marketers recognize it to be both a superior branding medium and a superior sales driver. Will video be the next performance-driven, marketing category? Marketing categories like search and retargeting have been held to a higher standard of accountability with sales and ROI as the main measures of campaign success. Evidence shows strong potential for digital video to drive ROI as 65 percent of marketers agree that video can be personalized like search and display. Fifty-six percent see that video fits with the current emphasis on data, targeting, efficiency and programmatic. Fifty-four percent believe it’s easy to track and prove digital video’s impact. The Death of TV Advertising or TV Advertising Reinvented? Return on ad spend (ROAS) or sales lift per dollar will surpass traditional branding in importance as a measure of digital video success within the next one to two years. This shift from measuring success by media outputs like impressions and CPMs to business outcomes such as sales will drive a major step change with how marketers plan, activate and determine traditional linear TV and video success.

PEAK SEASON: K Street is drafting contingency plans to address all potential outcomes of the election, Catherine Ho reports for The Washington Post. “The period from November to March around a presidential transition is probably the busiest time for lobby and public affairs firms,” said Stewart Verdery of Monument Policy Group. “Trying to figure out how to engage a new administration, who the appointments are, changes with [congressional committee] chairmen. That’s a huge amount of work for clients. At least 60 percent of business development work is done in the next couple months.” Key issues to the business community include immigration, tax reform and infrastructure spending. CHAMBEROLOGY: The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is expected to announce changes in its leadership structure with the impending departure of Bruce Josten, who will retire at the end of the year after 22 years, The Washington Post’s Catherine Ho reports. All eyes are on president and chief executive Tom Donohue and his executive vice president and adviser Suzanne Clark. “Tom is the Chamber outside Washington, Bruce is the Chamber inside Washington,” said one Republican lobbyist. “Together they’re a phenomenal act.” The restructuring will offer clues to its future lobbying strategies and operations. “The country is moving in a more populous mood, versus a what’s-good-for-business-is-good-for-America kind of thing,” lobbyist Rick Hohlt said. TAX TASTING: Speaker Paul Ryan’s Senior Tax Counsel, George Callas, led a discussion on tax reform Wednesday at an invitation-only luncheon hosted by Steptoe & Johnson at Sonoma Restaurant & Wine Bar. On hand from Steptoe’s tax team were firm Chair Phil West, who previously served as Treasury’s international tax counsel; Lisa Zarlenga and Cameron Arterton, who served as Treasury’s tax legislative counsel and deputy legislative counsel, respectively; and Leslie Belcher, a Hill veteran and close friend ofRyan and his wife, Janna.

The letter, led by the National Association of Manufacturers, stressed the “urgent need to restore faith in our vital economic and government institutions and to bolster the promise of America.” To #BeTheSolution, let’s start with infrastructure, a bipartisan priority. Let’s rebuild our roads, bridges, ports, passenger rail and transit systems. Let’s invest in pipelines, railroads, tunnels and airports as well as drinking water and wastewater systems. The “Building to Win” initiative lays it all out. From transportation infrastructure to the energy infrastructure that powers our country, we can build a stronger, more inclusive economy. America is falling behind the rest of the world, but with a serious, targeted plan we can secure our economic leadership, spur real economic growth and offer more people the dignity of work.

And why have so many been so silent about it? A recent article in the Wall Street Journal reports that not one CEO at a Fortune 100 company has donated to Donald Trump's campaign, whereas one-third supported Mitt Romney in 2012. Many in business have said privately that they are terrified of a Trump administration and the possibility of trade wars and ballooning deficits, yet few CEOs vocally oppose him. So why isn't a CEO social movement taking to the barricades against a Trump presidency? One possibility: To mobilize a movement, you need a social network, and CEOs no longer have one. In other words, corporate America's "old boys' club" is dead. The question is: Is that entirely a good thing? As our research – and Trump's rise – shows, not necessarily. Building the old boys' club For most of the postwar era, American corporations were overseen by a group of elite executives and directors who all knew each other or had friends in common. In 1974, there were roughly 100 people (all male and all but one white) who each served on five or more corporate boards. Corporate America was controlled by an "old boys' club." Social network analysis shows that the board members of any two corporations were rarely more than three or four degrees of separation apart. A sneeze in one boardroom could have triggered a flu epidemic infecting more than 90 percent of the Fortune 500 within a few months. Louis Brandeis, who served on the Supreme Court from 1916 to 1939, warned about this concentration of power in his 1914 book Other People's Money: And How the Bankers Use It. To him, the network among corporate directors was an "endless chain" that served as the "most potent instrument of the Money Trust." In the 1950s, sociologist C. Wright Mills labeled this group the "power elite," interweaving business, government and the military, and subsequent researchers documented how pervasive these ties were. The heyday of corporate influence President George W. Bush's first Cabinet may have been the high-water mark of the corporate network's influence. A few highlights: Before he became vice president, Dick Cheney served on the boards of Electronic Data Systems, Procter & Gamble and Union Pacific. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld had previously been CEO of GD Searle and General Instrument and served on the boards of Amylin Pharmaceuticals, Gilead Sciences and Tribune Co. Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill was CEO of Alcoa and director of Eastman Kodak and Lucent Technologies. And Labor Secretary Elaine Chao was on the boards of CR Bard, Clorox, Dole, HCA Healthcare, Marine Transport, Millipore, Northwest Airlines, Protective Life and Raymond James Financial. In all, the Bush Cabinet was directly tied to 21 corporations, two degrees from another 228 and three degrees of separation from over 1,100 companies listed on Nasdaq or the New York Stock Exchange. No administration in history had as many direct personal contacts with corporate America. Such network ties have a tangible effect on corporate actions. Scholars found that ideas about how to run a corporation spread from board to board through shared directors, just as fads and fashions spread through contact among people. Moreover, a number of studies showed that these connections shaped how corporations and their executives engaged in politics. For example, executives at companies linked together by shared directors tended to donate to the same political candidates. At the center of this network reigned a small, linked group of powerful executives – Wharton Business School professor Michael Useem dubbed them the "inner circle" – who came to share a common viewpoint about what was best for the long-term interests of American business as a whole. Serving on many boards, particularly big bank boards (which were bigger and often filled with well-connected CEOs), gave this group an expansive view of what was best for all of business and not just particular companies and industries. As Useem's work showed, this group tended to be prominent in both business and civic life, often including corporate executives, leaders of nonprofit and cultural institutions and former government officials. Being in regular contact with each other made concerted action possible, which helped them achieve their own aims but could also have positive societal benefits, such as organizing a successful Olympics bid. It also gave the group the potential to influence government policy – for better or worse. The demise of the power elite This world of cozy, highly connected boards is now gone. The JP Morgan Chase board in 2001 had 15 directors, and all but two of them served on other boards. One director served on eight boards, including the bank itself, five held five seats each, and another five were on three or four. Today, the bank's board consists of a dozen directors, half of them retirees from prior corporate jobs. One serves on four boards, another serves on three. The rest are on just one or two. For the corporate network as a whole, by 2012, only one director sat on five major boards (compared with about 100 who sat on that many or more in 1974). So what killed the inner circle? The corporate scandals of the early 2000s and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 were the precipitating factors. As our research shows, before these events, serving on many boards was a source of prestige, and the largest corporations courted well-connected directors. But after the scandals, being a well-connected director became suspect. For example, in 2002, Forbes published an article that profiled the five directors with the most S&P 500 board seats, asserting that they were too overstretched to provide adequate oversight. In 2004, Institutional Shareholder Services, which advises large institutional investors on corporate governance, began recommending that its clients vote against directors who served on too many boards. Within a few years, the inner circle had disintegrated. From group think to kingmakers Did the demise of the inner circle stop the 1 percent from dictating policy? Well, not exactly. Each individual in the corporate elite still wields considerable influence. But as sociologist Mark Mizruchi has pointed out, they now tend to do so as individuals pursuing their own idiosyncratic agendas rather than as a group. Think Sheldon Adelson or the Koch Brothers rather than the Business Roundtable. This has not been altogether a good thing. When a single network connected corporate America, executives were forced to listen to opinions from a range of peers. And although the group skewed Republican on average, individual directors held a range of political opinions. The most well-connected leaders converged on a preference for more moderate candidates and policies and often ended up donating to both parties' candidates, not just one. The support of this group was useful, if not absolutely essential, for potential presidential candidates, and it is hard to imagine that a putative anti-establishment candidate like Trump would have passed muster. The dense web of connections allowed the inner circle to police the corporate ranks and present a unified, middle-of-the-road message to policymakers. Our own research, forthcoming in the American Journal of Sociology, finds that board ties are now too sparse to provide a means for business executives to forge common ground. CEOs today rarely serve on two or more boards, and, as a result, they no longer have monthly opportunities to hear what peers who support another point of view might think. Those board connections turned out to be a force for political moderation, and annual gatherings in Davos are not enough to replace them. American politics has arrived at a millennial inflection point. While Mills and his fellow critics lambasted the well-connected corporate inner circle for furthering their own interests over those of the majority of society, we now see that the alternative may be dysfunction and an inability to find common ground. Extremists in every corner of the political universe can gather power by targeting well-heeled funders like Adelson on the right and George Soros on the left. In this new world, compromise is frowned upon. While we don't want to return to a world where a handful of powerful white men held rule over corporate America and by extension the nation, we may benefit from building structures that operate like board ties previously did, acting as a force for compromise and moderation. To hold together, American society may require new institutions that connect a broad and diverse spectrum of business and nonprofit leaders to each other, forcing individuals to consider the views of their peers.

PHOTO: Life of Pix Bangalore-based Wipro, an IT services company, plans to acquire Indianapolis-based Appirio for $500 million in a bid to build a global cloud transformation process. In a filing to the Securities and Exchange Board of India, Wipro said it expects the acquisition to enhance its market share and positioning in the cloud enterprise applications space, especially in Salesforce and Workday.  It also said it would "make it a partner of choice for clients who are looking at modernizing their processes and platforms onto next generation cloud applications." Established in 2006, Appirio is a global services company that helps customers advance employee and customer experience through cloud technologies. It has about 1,250 employees in offices in Indianapolis, San Francisco, Dublin, London, Tokyo and Jaipur, India. It was an early partner of Salesforce.com, Workday and Google, and a pioneer in crowdsourcing. Appirio brings Topcoder, a crowdsourcing marketplace that connects more than one million designers, developers and data scientists, to customers. The deal, announced this week, is expected to close by the end of the year subject to customary closing conditions. In other enterprise technology news ... Progress Releases DigitalFactory Progress has officially released its DigitalFactory suite, a cloud-based digital transformation solution built for developers, IT administrators and marketers to help them deliver customer experiences at a global scale.  Announced in May, the platform is aimed at helping businesses create omnichannel digital experiences. At the same time, Bedford, Mass.-based Progress also rebranded from Progress Software. Ian Gertler, marketing evangelist for Progress, told CMSWire then that the company's 2014 acquisition of Web CMS provider Telerik, the makers ofSitefinity Web CMS, was a major contributor to the company’s enhanced digital experience product suite.   Company officials said DigitalFactory helps enterprises simplify delivery including the ability to deliver native mobile capabilities using a single approach; overcome infrastructure challenges and support the business and technology at scale. "We spent the last year laying the foundation for Progress DigitalFactory, leveraging our skills and proven web content, mobility and data assets," Michael Benedict, chief product officer of Progress, said. "We made an investment in the future of our customers, to better enable them to rapidly innovate by providing more advanced capabilities that drive business agility and governance." Gartner: Global IT Spending to Reach $3.5T Worldwide IT spending will reach $3.5 trillion in 2017, according to Gartner analysts. That's up 2.9 percent from this year's estimated spending of $3.4 trillion, according to the latest forecast.  Software spending is projected to grow 6 percent in 2016, and it will grow another 7.2 percent in 2017 to total $357 billion. IT services spending is on pace to grow 3.9 percent in 2016 to reach $597 billion, and increase 4.8 percent in 2017 to reach $943 billion.  "The immediate impact of Brexit has caused modest growth in IT spending to turn negative for 2016," John-David Lovelock, research vice president at Gartner, said. "Without the UK, global IT spending growth would have been modestly positive at 0.2 percent in 2016, but with the UK included, IT spending is expected to decrease 0.3 percent. The immediate impact of the British pound will also cause the IT spending patterns to shift as prices for IT will increase."

Admap Editor Colin Grimshaw believes this is a hot topic right now. "We think this is a big issue. Many brands, including P&G, Mars and McDonald's, having jumped in to experiment with social media, and in some cases taking money from traditional media to do this, are now re-evaluating their use of social media. "But I think there is also a broader issue around how traditional media and new media fit together in the marketing landscape," he added. This is the sixth year of the Admap Prize, sponsored by Kantar, an essay contest that encourages and rewards individual excellence in strategic thinking in brand communications. Entry is free, essays are judged by a panel of the industry's foremost thought leaders, with all awarded essays being published in Admap. The closing date for entries is January 31 2017, and there will be a prize giving event in Cannes in June. Full details are available on the Prize website. Entrants are asked to consider how TV and social media can be used solus or in combination in meeting the challenges and seizing the new opportunities in today's advertising world. Different marketing categories often require different advertising and channel strategies, so essays will need to consider a specific marketing category – FMCG, autos, retail, financial services, food, telecommunications, etc – or a more granular product/service category within a marketing category. "Watching TV transform and interact with social media and creating new possibilities will be the biggest revolution in marketing since...the birth of TV," said Marco Rimini, CEO, Central Team, Mindshare Worldwide, and one of this year's judges. "I can't wait to see what the brightest, research-based minds think about what will happen." Fellow judge Darren McColl, Chief Brand & Marketing Strategy Officer, Global for SapientNitro, commented: "As social media matures, it is clearly becoming another core marketing and content channel like TV. However, the participatory nature of social channels is redefining the landscape for content and marketing. Our expectations are changing, our behaviours are changing, our marketing must change accordingly."

A shopper learns about a product, considers whether to buy it, decides to do so, goes to a shop. If he likes it, he may buy it again. Marketers have long obsessed over each step, and consultants have written treatises on how to nudge people along. E-commerce is already changing the process, but now retailing gurus are imagining a future in which shopping becomes fully automatic. The idea is that a combination of smart gadgets and predictive data analytics could decide exactly what goods are delivered when, to which household. The most advanced version might resemble Spotify, a music-streaming service, but for stuff. This future is inching closer, thanks to initiatives from Amazon, lots of startup firms and also from big consumer companies such as Procter & Gamble (P&G). Buying experiments so far fall into two categories. The first is exploratory. A service helps a shopper try new things, choosing products on his or her behalf. Birchbox, founded in 2010, sends beauty samples to subscribers for $10 each month. Imitators have proliferated, offering everything from dog toys to trainers. MySubscriptionAddiction.com, which reviews these services in English-speaking countries, counts 998 new subscription boxes so far this year, up from 284 new ones in 2013. Retailers such as Walmart have followed suit with their own boxes. The scope for such services, however, may be limited. One third of those surveyed by MySubscriptionAddiction.com said they cancelled at least as many subscriptions as they added this year. Consumers, naturally, will delegate purchases to a third party only when they receive products they like. In future, firms that comb purchase histories and search data may be able to send more reliably pleasing product assortments. For now, a consumer who becomes an unwitting owner of toeless socks, which were included recently in a box called FabFitFun, may decline further offers. The second category of automated consumption is more functional. A service automates the purchase of an item that is bought frequently. Nine years ago Amazon introduced a “Subscribe & Save” feature, offering consumers a discount for agreeing to buy certain goods regularly, such as Pampers nappies. Dollar Shave Club, a male-grooming-products firm, sells razors to subscribers directly, and P&G now has its own, similar service. It is also testing one for laundry detergent. Amazon is going further. Last year it began selling so-called Dash buttons, designed to be placed around the house to order everyday products—one for Campbell’s soup, for instance, and another for Whiskas cat food (pictured). Investors see this as the first step in its bid fully to automate buying of daily necessities. Already, some manufacturers have integrated Amazon into their devices; General Electric, for example, offers washing machines that shop for their own detergent. Such services have obvious appeal for Amazon and for big consumer brands. If a shopper automates the delivery of a particular item, the theory is that he is likely to be more loyal. For some brands, the buttons are working especially well: more than half of all the many Amazon orders for Maxwell House coffee in America, for example, are made through the Dash button. Amazon says that across America, an order from a Dash button is being placed more than twice each minute.    But neither Amazon nor the big product brands should celebrate a new era of shopping just yet. Amazon does not release comprehensive data on its automated services, but Slice Intelligence, a data firm in California, reported in March that fewer than half of those with Dash buttons had ever pressed them. One problem may be the e-commerce giant’s prices, which fluctuate often. Another report, by Salmon, a digital agency inside WPP, an advertising group, found that far more British consumers would prefer a smart device that ordered the cheapest item in a category to one that summoned up the same brand each time. That suggests that automated shopping, as it expands, might make life harder for big brands, not prop them up. twitter icon facebook icon more iconMore linkedin icon googleplus icon mail icon print icon purchase-rights icon Be the first to comment Editors’ picks GlobalisationThe third wave First free movement of goods, then ideas.

Consumer goods companies have been grappling with slowing volume sales over the past year, hit by falling household spending across the world, fierce competition from retailers' own-brand products and economic weakness in emerging markets. The pound's plunge since the June Brexit vote has put extra pressure on firms like Unilever <ULVR.L>, whose brands include Marmite yeast spread and Dove soap, by driving up the cost of their imports to Britain and dollar-traded commodities. Last week the Anglo-Dutch company tried to raise the prices of a range of products by 10 percent in Britain, prompting a stand-off with the country's largest supermarket, Tesco <TSCO.L>, which balked at the demand. The dispute - which showed an early effect of Britain's decision to leave the EU - was quickly resolved, but gave the public a rare glimpse into the difficult discussions that industry sources say are happening across the sector. An executive at one of Unilever's main rivals said it was also discussing possible price increases with UK supermarkets. A source at another rival said it faced the same pressures as Unilever but that it was not yet ready to raise prices and first wanted to exhaust cost-cutting options. Spirits company Pernod Ricard <PERP.PA> told Reuters it was planning price increases in Britain too. The Unilever row illustrated how reliant the company is on price rises - rather than increased volume sales - to make more money from shoppers around the world and how difficult that strategy may be to keep up, even as volatile currency and commodity environments drive up costs. The day "Marmitegate" dominated the front pages of British newspapers, the company reported a 3.2 percent rise in quarterly sales - with a 0.4 percent drop in the number of goods sold comfortably offset by a 3.6 percent increase in prices. It is not alone among its peers in this trend of slowing volumes and rising prices. This could put the sector on course for a long battle with big retailers like British supermarkets, which conversely need high sales volumes because of their tight margins and fixed costs, and low prices due to fierce competition in the domestic market. How this conflict might play out is unclear, with the Tesco row perhaps just a taste of what is to come. French food group Danone <DANO.PA>, which makes Activia yoghurt and Aptamil baby formula, reported a 0.7 percent fall in third-quarter volumes this week but, like Unilever, used price increases to drive a 2.1 percent rise in sales. Britain's Reckitt Benckiser's <RB.L>, which does not break down its sales by volumes and price rises, reported its weakest quarterly growth in over five years on Wednesday. Nestle <NESN.S> also posted its weakest sales growth in more than a decade on Thursday, with volumes slowing. Procter & Gamble <PG.N> reports results next week. Unilever, Reckitt and P&G all declined to comment on any future plans for price increases, while Danone did not respond to a request for comment. WHY UNILEVER? Unilever is the No. 1 supplier of ice cream, deodorants, bath and shower products and margarines and spreads in many countries, and has invested in marketing and brand innovation over the years, which gives it pricing power. But industry experts said the company's request for 10 percent price rises in Britain was aggressive, and that they did not expect its rivals to demand such high increases. "We think all UK food producers are going to need price increases in the next few months but we can't see 10 percent," said Jefferies analyst Martin Deboo. "Unilever's pricing strategy does seem to be about as aggressive as it could be." Unilever said its reliance on price increases was largely down to factors including weak consumer demand in emerging markets and the sharp devaluation of Latin American currencies. It is more exposed to these regions than most of its peers. Emerging markets as a whole account for almost 60 percent of its sales, with Latin America generating 16 percent of sales. Much of the company's third-quarter price rises were to offset currency devaluations in Latin America. It said currency swings globally had made its commodity costs 600 million euros ($659.5 million) more expensive this year, with a large part of that coming from Argentina, Brazil and Mexico. Unilever also said the rise in palm oil and crude prices was driving up the cost of manufacturing skin cleansers and laundry detergents - product categories where it is the dominant player in many markets including Britain. The Tesco dispute and earnings report raised investor concerns about the strength of its business, pushing its shares down more than 6 percent. Trevor Green, head of UK Equities at Unilever shareholder Aviva Investors, expressed confidence in CEO Paul Polman's team, telling Reuters they had done a good job of balancing price and volume growth over the past seven years. Another Unilever investor, Swiss asset management firm GAM, said the fall in sales volumes was tolerable for now. "If it's a quarter or two quarters, I'm not worried," GAM fund manager Xavier Van Hove said. "If it persists for more than four quarters, then yes, I would start to worry."

She previously worked for Reuters and the Wall Street Journal. Follow @labboudles Facebook Twitter Email Print Share Oct 20, 2016 7:46 AM EDT When Maurice Levy steps down next year, he will have been the head of Publicis for three decades. With the support of the Badinter family, which founded the company, he built Publicis from a sleepy regional player into the world's third-biggest ad agency.  Third-quarter organic sales growth 0.2% But this lion of ad land is limping to the end of his tenure. Levy will leave his yet-to-be-identified successor with a long to-do list. Since his plan to merge Publicis with second-largest rival Omnicom fell apart in 2014, the French-based agency has been losing market share to competitors including WPP, Omnicom and Havas. It lost marquee brands such as Procter & Gamble and Coca-Cola when a spate of U.S. contracts went up for renewal last year. Painful Stretch Publicis has trailed competitors in terms of organic sales growth since the failure of a planned merger with Omnicom in May 2014. Source: Bloomberg Intelligence Those contract losses are being felt. Third-quarter sales (excluding acquisitions) grew by only 0.2 percent to reach 2.32 billion euros, the company said on Thursday. The figures narrowly missed analyst estimates and sent the shares down 6 percent. That takes organic sales growth in the first nine months of the year to 1.9 percent, which is better than 1 percent in the same period last year. But it pales in comparison to the 3.4 percent that Omnicom has achieved in the same period. Publicis's problem isn't about cost controls -- at 17.4 percent its 2015 Ebitda margin was the best among the top five agencies. It's more a question of revenue and coaxing employees to generate more of it. Sales per employee trail its peers. Labor Intensive Advertising agencies' main cost of doing business is salaries so squeezing the most out of their talent is a competitive advantage. Publicis trails leader Omnicom in terms of sales per employee. Source: Bloomberg Intelligence Publicis replaced managers after the contract losses, and overhauled its structure to ensure disparate agencies worked better together. While the company has won some new business lately, including Wal-Mart, investors will hope more benefits lie ahead. Worse, the $3.7 billion acquisition of digital agency Sapient in 2014 hasn't yet delivered the hoped-for boost to growth. The deal was designed to help Publicis offer more technology consulting services to clients. Sapient has an army of 8,500 developers in India who build mobile apps and e-commerce systems. The deal set Publicis apart from rivals and pits it against consultants like Accenture and Deloitte who are creeping onto ad agency turf. Levy cast the deal as a visionary move and promised it would raise group operating margins by 2018.  It will be up to his successor to get more out of the business. Publicis's return on invested capital, which includes acquisitions, trails its peers, as this chart shows. M&A Machines Advertising agencies do lots of acquisitions to bolster digital skills and geographical reach. Yet the return on invested capital at Publicis has been worsening in recent years. Source: Bloomberg Intelligence Succeeding the charismatic Levy was always going to be a big task. A board committee has started work, and a decision is expected early next year. Levy has hinted that internal candidates are preferred. Arthur Sadoun, who heads all of Publicis' creative agencies, is a leading candidate, and may share the CEO title with Alan Herrick, who joined with the Sapient deal,  according to a recent report in Les Echos.  Whether Levy is asked to stay on as a board member or vice-chairman would be a sign of whether the Badinter family want him to help with the transition or prefer a clean break. Either way, his successor needs find a way to sharpen up the Publicis pitch. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.

REUTERS/Philippe Wojazer/File Photo prev next prev next Thumbnail Enlarge Caption  Email More A A LONDON: Unilever's push to raise the prices of its brands in Britain in response to a fall in the pound exposed the vulnerabilities of a company: and wider consumer brands industry: that can no longer count on selling more goods to deliver revenue growth. Consumer goods companies have been grappling with slowing volume sales over the past year, hit by falling household spending across the world, fierce competition from retailers' own-brand products and economic weakness in emerging markets. The pound's plunge since the June Brexit vote has put extra pressure on firms like Unilever , whose brands include Marmite yeast spread and Dove soap, by driving up the cost of their imports to Britain and dollar-traded commodities. Last week the Anglo-Dutch company tried to raise the prices of a range of products by 10 percent in Britain, prompting a stand-off with the country's largest supermarket, Tesco , which balked at the demand. The dispute - which showed an early effect of Britain's decision to leave the EU - was quickly resolved, but gave the public a rare glimpse into the difficult discussions that industry sources say are happening across the sector. An executive at one of Unilever's main rivals said it was also discussing possible price increases with UK supermarkets. A source at another rival said it faced the same pressures as Unilever but that it was not yet ready to raise prices and first wanted to exhaust cost-cutting options. Spirits company Pernod Ricard told Reuters it was planning price increases in Britain too. The Unilever row illustrated how reliant the company is on price rises - rather than increased volume sales - to make more money from shoppers around the world and how difficult that strategy may be to keep up, even as volatile currency and commodity environments drive up costs. The day "Marmitegate" dominated the front pages of British newspapers, the company reported a 3.2 percent rise in quarterly sales - with a 0.4 percent drop in the number of goods sold comfortably offset by a 3.6 percent increase in prices. It is not alone among its peers in this trend of slowing volumes and rising prices. This could put the sector on course for a long battle with big retailers like British supermarkets, which conversely need high sales volumes because of their tight margins and fixed costs, and low prices due to fierce competition in the domestic market. How this conflict might play out is unclear, with the Tesco row perhaps just a taste of what is to come. French food group Danone , which makes Activia yoghurt and Aptamil baby formula, reported a 0.7 percent fall in third-quarter volumes this week but, like Unilever, used price increases to drive a 2.1 percent rise in sales. Britain's Reckitt Benckiser's , which does not break down its sales by volumes and price rises, reported its weakest quarterly growth in over five years on Wednesday. Nestle also posted its weakest sales growth in more than a decade on Thursday, with volumes slowing. Procter & Gamble reports results next week. Unilever, Reckitt and P&G all declined to comment on any future plans for price increases, while Danone did not respond to a request for comment. WHY UNILEVER? Unilever is the No. 1 supplier of ice cream, deodorants, bath and shower products and margarines and spreads in many countries, and has invested in marketing and brand innovation over the years, which gives it pricing power. But industry experts said the company's request for 10 percent price rises in Britain was aggressive, and that they did not expect its rivals to demand such high increases. "We think all UK food producers are going to need price increases in the next few months but we can't see 10 percent," said Jefferies analyst Martin Deboo. "Unilever's pricing strategy does seem to be about as aggressive as it could be." Unilever said its reliance on price increases was largely down to factors including weak consumer demand in emerging markets and the sharp devaluation of Latin American currencies. It is more exposed to these regions than most of its peers. Emerging markets as a whole account for almost 60 percent of its sales, with Latin America generating 16 percent of sales. Much of the company's third-quarter price rises were to offset currency devaluations in Latin America. It said currency swings globally had made its commodity costs 600 million euros (US$659.5 million) more expensive this year, with a large part of that coming from Argentina, Brazil and Mexico. Unilever also said the rise in palm oil and crude prices was driving up the cost of manufacturing skin cleansers and laundry detergents - product categories where it is the dominant player in many markets including Britain. The Tesco dispute and earnings report raised investor concerns about the strength of its business, pushing its shares down more than 6 percent. Trevor Green, head of UK Equities at Unilever shareholder Aviva Investors, expressed confidence in CEO Paul Polman's team, telling Reuters they had done a good job of balancing price and volume growth over the past seven years. Another Unilever investor, Swiss asset management firm GAM, said the fall in sales volumes was tolerable for now. "If it's a quarter or two quarters, I'm not worried," GAM fund manager Xavier Van Hove said. "If it persists for more than four quarters, then yes, I would start to worry."

Ronald McDonald clowns around Apriil 22, 2016, at a youth basketball game in Olympia Fields. McDonald's recently has put its clown mascot on a bit of a commercial hiatus as a rash of creepy clown sightings have made headlines. (Allen Cunningham / Daily Southtown) Robert ReedContact ReporterChicago Tribune So it's come to this: McDonald's is benching the Ronald. As the Tribune recently reported, clown mascot Ronald McDonald is on a commercial hiatus, the result of a company effort to distance one of the world's most recognized corporate symbols from a recent flurry of bizarre and disturbing clown sightings that have been linked to threatening incidents near college campuses and elsewhere. McDonald's decision is understandable. Companies ignoring issues that could hurt their reputations, including multimillion-dollar investments in corporate mascots and symbols, are just begging for trouble, experts contend. That goes for businesses that are innocent victims of outside events, like McDonald's, and those that cook up their own difficulties, such as Wells Fargo, which allegedly created more than 2 million fraudulent customer banking accounts over five years. Computer outage could tarnish Delta's on-time reputation Tribune news services We don't cancel flights. That's been the message for the past two years from Delta Air Lines. Double decker buses roamed the streets of New York, wrapped in ads proclaiming "canceling cancellations." Delta executives boasted about the number of days without a single flight scrapped. That all literally... We don't cancel flights. That's been the message for the past two years from Delta Air Lines. Double decker buses roamed the streets of New York, wrapped in ads proclaiming "canceling cancellations." Delta executives boasted about the number of days without a single flight scrapped. That all literally... (Tribune news services) We've heard the adage: "Never let a good crisis go to waste." Too often, however, companies mismanage their calamities and end up making matters worse. "You got to say your apologies, fix the problem and wait," says Kent Grayson, associate professor of marketing at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management. It may seem funny, but shielding a corporate mascot is one of the first lines of defense. McDonald's declined to comment on that matter, so I connected with another corporate symbol with deep Chicago roots: the Pillsbury doughboy. The doughboy, aka Poppin' Fresh, was created by Rudolph Perz when he worked for Chicago-based advertising agency Leo Burnett. Mess with the doughboy and expect a call from one of owner General Mills' phalanx of attorneys, who protect the 50-year-old symbol and other product icons like Betty Crocker from being mistreated in pop culture, on the internet or anywhere else. "If we see the doughboy being misused, we remedy that situation," said a spokesman for Minneapolis-based General Mills. "The Pillsbury doughboy is our brand ambassador." Stamping out urban myths about corporate symbols is also a priority of consumer product companies. An example: Procter & Gamble, the maker of Tide and Mr. Clean, takes legal aim at groups or individuals caught spreading wild rumors that Cincinnati-based P&G is affiliated with Satanism and that an old corporate symbol of the moon and stars included a subliminal homage to the devil. That fight has been going on for decades. Ronald McDonald has kept low profile long before clown scare Samantha Bomkamp Ronald. Paging Ronald. Are you there, Ronald? McDonald's said Tuesday that its trusty clown mascot Ronald McDonald is taking a hiatus in response to a rash of creepy clown sightings across the U.S. and even across the pond. But he was keeping a low profile long before that. Ronald McDonald has... Ronald. Paging Ronald. Are you there, Ronald?

But he was keeping a low profile long before that. Ronald McDonald has... (Samantha Bomkamp) While damaging gossip is enough to make anyone see red, companies that inflict pain on themselves have the hardest time repairing their reputations. Consider Volkswagen, which was caught in a nasty scandal after U.S. regulators claimed the German-based automaker allegedly rigged emission testing on more than 1 million of its diesel vehicles. In a 2016 Harris annual poll on corporate reputations for the nations' 100 most visible companies, Volkswagen's troubles gave it enough notoriety to break into that ranking, coming in at 100. But it also racked up a "very poor" reputational rating, a decline from its "very good" result a year before, when it was not in the Harris top 100 but was more widely respected. The Harris survey attributed Volkswagen's plummet to a breakdown in public trust, admiration, respect and social responsibility. Volkswagen has vowed to regain customer trust. Can damaged enterprises salvage their reputations? Experts say it is possible, provided companies shake the delusional view that the crisis is merely a public relations snafu or an annoyance. Some consumers shy away from Wells Fargo in wake of scandal Jonnelle Marte Some consumers may be shying away from Wells Fargo after learning that employees used customers' information to open sham accounts, according to new figures reported by the bank. The nation's largest retail bank beat expectations when it reported more than $5.6 billion in profit for the past three...

The nation's largest retail bank beat expectations when it reported more than $5.6 billion in profit for the past three... (Jonnelle Marte) That's especially important if the public determines the root cause of a corporate crisis is executive greed, ruthlessness or incompetence. If so, then issuing a perfunctory apology and urging everyone to move forward won't cut it. Instead, a company that's under fire should act to change its culture, which typically means replacing some upper management, working with critics or government to solve the problem, discontinuing systemic practices that allowed the crisis to fester and then realizing it will take time before anyone notices a difference. But consumers will cut companies some slack even after being let down. The Harris poll indicates folks get annoyed but don't hold a long grudge when technological woes or work stoppages temporarily disrupt service. The same goes for companies dealing with short-term financial stumbles that may momentarily freak out Wall Street but are shrugged off by Main Street. Even so, more companies are realizing corporate reputations are part of a fragile compact with society, one that requires attention, tending and protection. Or to put it another way: That's why McDonald's isn't just clowning around. roreed@chicagotribune.com Twitter @reedtribbiz Copyright © 2016, Chicago Tribune Wells Fargo Leo Burnett There's high interest in cracking down on payday lending — and pushback, too Meet the Ohio resident who quit his law firm job to run a Cubs blog Illinois business: Let's make a Cuba trade deal Breaking Sports Trending Opinion Suburbs Entertainment Business Advertising 32°

Consumer goods companies have been grappling with slowing volume sales over the past year, hit by falling household spending across the world, fierce competition from retailers' own-brand products and economic weakness in emerging markets. The pound's plunge since the June Brexit vote has put extra pressure on firms like Unilever, whose brands include Marmite yeast spread and Dove soap, by driving up the cost of their imports to Britain and dollar-traded commodities. Last week the Anglo-Dutch company tried to raise the prices of a range of products by 10 percent in Britain, prompting a stand-off with the country's largest supermarket, Tesco , which balked at the demand. The dispute - which showed an early effect of Britain's decision to leave the EU - was quickly resolved, but gave the public a rare glimpse into the difficult discussions that industry sources say are happening across the sector. An executive at one of Unilever's main rivals said it was also discussing possible price increases with UK supermarkets. A source at another rival said it faced the same pressures as Unilever but that it was not yet ready to raise prices and first wanted to exhaust cost-cutting options. Spirits company Pernod Ricard told Reuters it was planning price increases in Britain too. The Unilever row illustrated how reliant the company is on price rises - rather than increased volume sales - to make more money from shoppers around the world and how difficult that strategy may be to keep up, even as volatile currency and commodity environments drive up costs. The day "Marmitegate" dominated the front pages of British newspapers, the company reported a 3.2 percent rise in quarterly sales - with a 0.4 percent drop in the number of goods sold comfortably offset by a 3.6 percent increase in prices. It is not alone among its peers in this trend of slowing volumes and rising prices. This could put the sector on course for a long battle with big retailers like British supermarkets, which conversely need high sales volumes because of their tight margins and fixed costs, and low prices due to fierce competition in the domestic market. How this conflict might play out is unclear, with the Tesco row perhaps just a taste of what is to come. French food group Danone, which makes Activia yoghurt and Aptamil baby formula, reported a 0.7 percent fall in third-quarter volumes this week but, like Unilever, used price increases to drive a 2.1 percent rise in sales. Britain's Reckitt Benckiser's, which does not break down its sales by volumes and price rises, reported its weakest quarterly growth in over five years on Wednesday. Nestle also posted its weakest sales growth in more than a decade on Thursday, with volumes slowing. Procter & Gamble reports results next week. Unilever, Reckitt and P&G all declined to comment on any future plans for price increases, while Danone did not respond to a request for comment. WHY UNILEVER? Unilever is the No. 1 supplier of ice cream, deodorants, bath and shower products and margarines and spreads in many countries, and has invested in marketing and brand innovation over the years, which gives it pricing power. But industry experts said the company's request for 10 percent price rises in Britain was aggressive, and that they did not expect its rivals to demand such high increases. "We think all UK food producers are going to need price increases in the next few months but we can't see 10 percent," said Jefferies analyst Martin Deboo. "Unilever's pricing strategy does seem to be about as aggressive as it could be." Unilever said its reliance on price increases was largely down to factors including weak consumer demand in emerging markets and the sharp devaluation of Latin American currencies. It is more exposed to these regions than most of its peers. Emerging markets as a whole account for almost 60 percent of its sales, with Latin America generating 16 percent of sales. Much of the company's third-quarter price rises were to offset currency devaluations in Latin America. It said currency swings globally had made its commodity costs 600 million euros ($659.5 million) more expensive this year, with a large part of that coming from Argentina, Brazil and Mexico. Unilever also said the rise in palm oil and crude prices was driving up the cost of manufacturing skin cleansers and laundry detergents - product categories where it is the dominant player in many markets including Britain. The Tesco dispute and earnings report raised investor concerns about the strength of its business, pushing its shares down more than 6 percent. Trevor Green, head of UK Equities at Unilever shareholder Aviva Investors, expressed confidence in CEO Paul Polman's team, telling Reuters they had done a good job of balancing price and volume growth over the past seven years. Another Unilever investor, Swiss asset management firm GAM, said the fall in sales volumes was tolerable for now. "If it's a quarter or two quarters, I'm not worried," GAM fund manager Xavier Van Hove said. "If it persists for more than four quarters, then yes, I would start to worry."

Published on October 21, 2016. Most Popular As chief marketing officer of Koch Industries' Georgia-Pacific Corp., Douwe Bergsma has brought on Droga5, Deutsch, Cutwater, the Martin Agency and most recently VaynerMedia to rework the marketing across eight brands. But along with that, he's taught his entire marketing department about storytelling with the help of Character LLC in a process that includes improv training. In a talk to the Association of National Advertisers Masters of Marketing Conference in Orlando on Friday, Mr. Bergsma said that's helped his brands grow sales and share despite not boosting spending -- and getting outspent by the likes of Procter & Gamble Co. and Kimberly-Clark Corp. Among other things, his marketers have learned that good stories frequently involve conflict – something that the brand has worked into the narrative around Brawny's "Stay Giant" campaign from Cutwater, which is about personifying the brand's inner contradiction about being both tough and gentle. In a video interview with Advertising Age, Mr. Bergsma talked about why storytelling training is important for marketers, and how the approach has played out for Brawny.

About a third of S&P 500 companies are scheduled to report next week, including Apple on Tuesday. Amazon.com and Google's parent Alphabet are set to post quarterly results on Thursday, the busiest day of the earnings season. "If nothing changes … we would say we came out of the earnings recession this quarter and that the second quarter was the final quarter of this earnings recession," said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. Financials, materials and technology are expected to show the most earnings per share growth this quarter, Stovall said, while energy industrials and telecom are forecast to be the laggards. In the past week, financials were among the top performers after the major bank earnings topped expectations. The S&P 500 gained about 8 points for the week to end at 2,141 Friday. Next week, "I think really the big focus is going to be on earnings," said Casey Clark, vice president of investment strategy at Glenmede. "I think we're in a situation where investors are focusing on earnings and traditional drivers of equity markets. Part of that is there's more comfort on global central bank policy." A UBS study in October showed that over the last five years, the S&P 500 moves more in sync with earnings per share than the level of interest rates. The correlation between stocks and earnings was very high, almost 90 percent, vs. less than 40 percent correlation between stocks and interest rates. Correlation of S&P 500 vs. interest rates and EPS, last five years, in % Source: UBS, as of October 20, 2016. The average year-end S&P 500 target is 2,198, according to CNBC's Market Strategist Survey conducted in October. But strategists are watching whether earnings growth will sustain further gains in the market. "Next year's earnings look too high, and that might mean the market is a tad more expensive than it looks, but it's helpful that the third-quarter earnings [are beating so far]," said Brian Nick, chief investment strategist at TIAA Global Asset Management, which has about $915 billion in assets under management. "We're still making our way out of this period where energy earnings look weak compared to where they were one year ago," Nick said. Most analysts expect the Federal Reserve to raise rates at its December meeting, but will watch data ahead of the central bank's meeting on Nov. 1 and 2. The Markit manufacturing and services PMI are scheduled for release next Monday and Wednesday, respectively. Three Fed speakers are set to speak Monday ahead of the blackout period heading into the Fed's meeting Nov. 1 and 2. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard speaks on the U.S. economy and monetary policy Monday morning, while Chicago Fed President Charles Evans is set to speak on current economic conditions and monetary policy in the afternoon. Fed Governor Jerome Powell is scheduled to speak later in the day on the future of Treasury market settlement. The first read on U.S. gross domestic product is due next Friday, and the consensus estimate from Reuters is 2.5 percent. The final read on second-quarter GDP showed an annual rate of 1.4 percent growth. A print between 1.5 percent and 3 percent is "probably a number consistent with the Fed passing in November but hiking in December," said John Canally, chief economic strategist at LPL Financial. Other data scheduled for release next week include the Markit manufacturing and services PMI, the employment cost index, consumer sentiment and pending home sales. Overseas, the preliminary estimate on third-quarter U.K. GDP is due for release Thursday, the first full-quarter GDP data since the surprise U.K. vote to leave the European Union. "Brexit negotiations [are] always on slow boil every week and next week is no different," Canally said. "A very weak number on the U.K.[GDP] may weaken Prime Minister May's hand temporarily." European Central Bank President Mario Draghi is scheduled to speak Tuesday in Berlin on "Stability, Equity and Monetary Policy."

Credit: Target More like this Apple commits to run off 100% renewable energy Apple’s $850M solar plant rockets it to first place among U.S. corporations Rooftop solar installation prices drop as does payback time Video Mingis on Tech: From superfast SSDs to Bluetooth locks and solar shingles Target has surpassed perennial champion Walmart as the U.S.'s top corporate user of solar power, according to a new report. Target has installed 147 megawatts (million watts or MW) of solar capacity on 300 stores, according to the 2016 Solar Means Business Report from the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA). "We're incredibly proud of the progress we've made in improving building efficiencies and reducing environmental impact. Our commitment to installing solar panels on 500 stores and distribution centers by 2020 is evidence of that progress," John Leisen, vice president of property management at Target, said in the SEIA statement. Walmart had held the top spot for the previous four years and still claims second place with 145MW of solar power installed on 364 buildings, according to the SEIA, which has been tracking corporate solar deployments for the past five years. This year, real estate developer Prologis came in third with 107.8MW of solar. Apple, which is in fourth place with 93.9MW of installed solar power, is a likely contender for first place sometime next year. Last year, Apple announced it was investing $850 million in a solar power plant through a partnership with First Solar, one of the nation's largest photovoltaic (PV) manufacturers and provider of utility-scale PV plants. Through a 25-year purchasing agreement, Apple will get 130MW from the new California Flats Solar Project. The project is currently under construction and is expected to be completed by the end of this year. Other Top 10 companies recognized in the SEIA's report include Costco (50.7 MW), Kohl's (50.2 MW), IKEA (44 MW), Macy's (38.9 MW), General Growth Properties (30.2 MW) and Hartz Mountain Industries (22.7 MW). While IKEA is in seventh place, it powers 91% of its retail locations through solar, according to the SEIA. Overall, U.S. corporations have doubled their solar installations year over year and are expected to close out 2016 with nearly 280MW of solar power -- compared to 130MW in 2015. The SEIA's report covers corporate solar installations in 38 states plus Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico; it tracks almost 1,100MW of solar installations at 2,000 U.S. companies. "To put that in context, that's enough electricity to power the equivalent of 193,000 homes every year," the report stated. "Also noteworthy, in just the first three quarters of 2016, the report found 142MW of corporate solar was added in the U.S., more than was installed in all of 2015 (129 MW)." In 2014, frustrated by a lack of renewable energy and a purchasing system that's too complicated, major U.S. companies joined an initiative to force the government and utilities to change. Along with the World Wildlife Fund and the World Resources Institute, the corporations signed a pact supporting six principles to clearly identify what's needed when purchasing renewable energy. The initial companies included Bloomberg, Facebook, General Motors, Hewlett-Packard, Intel, Johnson & Johnson, Mars, Novelis, Procter and Gamble, REI, Sprint and Walmart. The companies called for six specific changes they wanted the energy industry to adopt to increase renewable energy use: Greater choice in procurement options More access to cost competitive options Longer- and variable-term contracts Access to new projects that reduce emissions Streamlined third-party financing Increased purchasing options with utilities "Solar plays a vital role within our renewable energy portfolio," Mark Vanderhelm, vice president of energy for Walmart, said in a statement.

We are here providing food, shelter, relief supplies and other support to help thousands of people whose lives have been upended by this storm,” said Brad Kieserman, Red Cross vice president, Disaster Operations and Logistics. “We’re in the middle of a vast response, and our work is far from over. The Red Cross will be here as long as people need our help.” MAKE A DONATION The massive Red Cross relief effort in response to Hurricane Matthew in the U.S. could cost between $24 – $28 million as volunteers continue to help in the weeks ahead while residents recover from the devastation – yet, the Red Cross has raised only $8.1 million in designated donations and pledges for the response to Matthew thus far. The Red Cross depends on donations to provide immediate relief. Help people affected by Hurricane Matthew by visiting redcross.org, calling 1-800-RED CROSS, or texting the word MATTHEW to 90999 to make a $10 donation. Donations enable the Red Cross to prepare for, respond to and help people recover from this disaster. The Red Cross depends on donations to provide immediate relief. Help people affected by Hurricane Matthew by visiting redcross.org, calling 1-800-RED CROSS, or texting the word MATTHEW to 90999 to make a $10 donation. Donations enable the Red Cross to prepare for, respond to and help people recover from this disaster. RED CROSS RESPONSE Preliminary reports indicate more than 12,000 homes across four states have been affected. The Red Cross has deployed more than three-fourths of its emergency vehicle fleet, along with 5,500 disaster workers to provide relief. Working alongside dozens of partners, this help includes: Opened 378 Red Cross and community shelters with more than 97,000 overnight stays in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina. Today, nearly 1,000 people remain in shelters in Florida, North Carolina and South Carolina. Served more than 1.1 million meals and snacks with the help of Southern Baptist Disaster Relief, and deployed 25 mobile kitchens. Distributed more than 238,000 relief items, including hygiene and cleaning supplies. Provided almost 23,000 health services, such as replacing lost medications and eyeglasses and emotional support contacts. ROLL UP A SLEEVE TO REPLENISH THE BLOOD SUPPLY Hurricane Matthew has had far-reaching impacts in the Southeast, forcing the cancellation of approximately 110 blood drives resulting in nearly 3,500 uncollected blood and platelet donations. Right now, there is an emergency need for platelet donations in many areas of the country. Platelets are a key clotting component of blood often needed by cancer patients that must be transfused within five days of donation. Eligible blood and platelet donors are urged to make an appointment as soon as possible to help replenish the blood supply for patients in need. Appointments can be made by using the Red Cross Blood Donor App, visiting redcrossblood.org or calling 1-800-RED CROSS (1-800-733-2767). HELPING IN HAITI The American Red Cross, with a permanent team in Haiti of almost 200 staff, continues to work with local and international partners to deliver critical relief to aid many of the 175,000 residents displaced by Hurricane Matthew. American Red Cross and Haitian Red Cross teams have been distributing items including cholera-kits, hygiene kits and kitchen (cooking) kits, water purification products, shelter items and mosquito nets to meet people’s urgent needs. Cholera is an increasing threat due to damaged water systems and the lack of potable water; thus the provision of cholera kits —which contain items like soap, water purification tablets and oral rehydration salts – are an effort to help stem this threat. The American Red Cross is also supporting the Haitian Red Cross in coordinating between local authorities and other humanitarian organizations, and is working directly with the United States government to help distribute relief supplies. In addition, the American Red Cross has also brought in and set up generators and telecommunications equipment to support communications capabilities and deployed 11 disaster response specialists to lend their humanitarian relief expertise in areas such as emergency distribution and telecommunications support. In Haiti, the American Red Cross currently estimates spending more than $4 million to help the country recover. To date, the American Red Cross has received approximately $400,000 in donations and pledges specifically for the Caribbean, including Haiti. In addition, the American Red Cross will utilize some funds raised for the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, which were allocated specifically for contingencies and unexpected events such as disasters, as well as funds from grants and other donations designated for international causes. CORPORATIONS HELP The generous donations from members of the Red Cross Annual Disaster Giving Program (ADGP) and the Disaster Responder Program enable the American Red Cross to prepare communities for disasters big and small, respond whenever and wherever disasters occur and help families during the recovery process.

affected News provided by American Red Cross Oct 21, 2016, 13:20 ET Share this article WASHINGTON, Oct. 21, 2016 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- More than two weeks after Hurricane Matthew began its path of destruction, the American Red Cross has served more than a million meals and snacks, and provided 97,000 overnight shelter stays to people in need, prompting the charity to issue a call for the public's help. "The effects of Hurricane Matthew are still causing significant flooding in parts of North Carolina and South Carolina. We are here providing food, shelter, relief supplies and other support to help thousands of people whose lives have been upended by this storm," said Brad Kieserman, Red Cross vice president, Disaster Operations and Logistics. "We're in the middle of a vast response, and our work is far from over. The Red Cross will be here as long as people need our help.

American Red Cross staff provide food for Hurricane Matthew survivors in Lumberton, NC. MAKE A DONATION The massive Red Cross relief effort in response to Hurricane Matthew in the U.S. could cost between $24 – $28 million as volunteers continue to help in the weeks ahead while residents recover from the devastation – yet, the Red Cross has raised only $8.1 million in designated donations and pledges for the response to Matthew thus far. The Red Cross depends on donations to provide immediate relief. Help people affected by Hurricane Matthew by visiting redcross.org, calling 1-800-RED CROSS, or texting the word MATTHEW to 90999 to make a $10 donation. Donations enable the Red Cross to prepare for, respond to and help people recover from this disaster. RED CROSS RESPONSE Preliminary reports indicate more than 12,000 homes across four states have been affected. The Red Cross has deployed more than three-fourths of its emergency vehicle fleet, along with 5,500 disaster workers to provide relief. Working alongside dozens of partners, this help includes: Opened 378 Red Cross and community shelters with more than 97,000 overnight stays in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina. Today, nearly 1,000 people remain in shelters in Florida, North Carolina and South Carolina. Served more than 1.1 million meals and snacks with the help of Southern Baptist Disaster Relief, and deployed 25 mobile kitchens. Distributed more than 238,000 relief items, including hygiene and cleaning supplies. Provided almost 23,000 health services, such as replacing lost medications and eyeglasses and emotional support contacts. ROLL UP A SLEEVE TO REPLENISH THE BLOOD SUPPLY Hurricane Matthew has had far-reaching impacts in the Southeast, forcing the cancellation of approximately 110 blood drives resulting in nearly 3,500 uncollected blood and platelet donations. Right now, there is an emergency need for platelet donations in many areas of the country. Platelets are a key clotting component of blood often needed by cancer patients that must be transfused within five days of donation. Eligible blood and platelet donors are urged to make an appointment as soon as possible to help replenish the blood supply for patients in need. Appointments can be made by using the Red Cross Blood Donor App, visiting redcrossblood.org or calling 1-800-RED CROSS (1-800-733-2767). HELPING IN HAITI The American Red Cross, with a permanent team in Haiti of almost 200 staff, continues to work with local and international partners to deliver critical relief to aid many of the 175,000 residents displaced by Hurricane Matthew. American Red Cross and Haitian Red Cross teams have been distributing items including cholera-kits, hygiene kits and kitchen (cooking) kits, water purification products, shelter items and mosquito nets to meet people's urgent needs. Cholera is an increasing threat due to damaged water systems and the lack of potable water; thus the provision of cholera kits —which contain items like soap, water purification tablets and oral rehydration salts – are an effort to help stem this threat. The American Red Cross is also supporting the Haitian Red Cross in coordinating between local authorities and other humanitarian organizations, and is working directly with the United States government to help distribute relief supplies. In addition, the American Red Cross has also brought in and set up generators and telecommunications equipment to support communications capabilities and deployed 11 disaster response specialists to lend their humanitarian relief expertise in areas such as emergency distribution and telecommunications support. In Haiti, the American Red Cross currently estimates spending more than $4 million to help the country recover. To date, the American Red Cross has received approximately $400,000 in donations and pledges specifically for the Caribbean, including Haiti. In addition, the American Red Cross will utilize some funds raised for the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, which were allocated specifically for contingencies and unexpected events such as disasters, as well as funds from grants and other donations designated for international causes.

(NYSE: TRV) which traded down 5.86% at $109.42. The stock’s 52-week range is $101.23 to $119.32. Volume of 3.36 million was more than double the daily average of around 1.4 million shares. The insurance company posted weak third-quarter earnings this morning.. Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE: VZ) traded down 2.64% at $49.05. The stock’s 52-week range is $43.79 to $56.95. Trading volume was about 60% above the daily average of around 12.1 million. The company reported third-quarter results this morning and a drop in revenues and subscribers did shares in. Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE: CAT) traded down 0.85% at $96.49. The stock’s 52-week range is $56.36 to $89.87. Volume was about 10% below the daily average of around 4.3 million shares. The heavy equipment maker had no specific news Thursday. The Procter & Gamble Co. (NYSE: PG) traded down 0.75% at $84.90. The stock’s 52-week range is $73.61 to $90.33.

In 1947 Valerie, the wife of an Army officer, was living in Camberley, Surrey, and expecting her third child. She was not looking forward to the prospect of washing, ironing and drying the traditional towelling nappies which were all that were available at the time.  “I just didn’t want to wash them,” she told an interviewer last year. “You had to iron them as well. It was awful labour. I was amazed you couldn’t buy a disposable version. I enquired of the US and you couldn’t buy them there. It was extraordinary.”  So she decided she had better do something about it herself.  Valerie Hunter Gordon with her daughter Frances After a certain amount of trial and error (initially she used old nylon parachutes, of which there were many spare after the war), and drawing on her considerable needlework skills, she came up with a pair of adjustable PVC waterproof pants fastened with poppers, with a cord around the waist, which could be wiped clean, or washed and bleached. Into these she slipped a pad of cellulose wadding with a thin layer of cotton wool next to the baby’s skin to prevent soreness. The waterproof pants prevented leakage and were shaped to ensure that the pad remained in position without safety pins. Unlike modern all-in-one disposable nappies, Valerie’s design meant that only the biodegradable dirty pads were disposed of, while the waterproof pants could be rinsed and used again. This  system created very little permanent waste; it also significantly reduced the water and electricity consumption associated with washing cotton nappies.  Design for the Paddi nappy Credit: Universal News (Europe) The nappies were a huge success on her baby son Nigel and she soon began taking orders from the wives of other senior officers at Staff College in Camberley. “My husband used to cut out the pads on the floor of the attic when he came home from work and I used to run them up with my mother’s old sewing machine... I would go out for tea with the wives and babies, and they would say, 'Oh Valerie, wouldn’t you make one for me?’ It became a full-time job. It was more hard work than washing the damn things.”   The old Singer sewing machine remained in regular use in her children’s nursery until the final years of her life. Of the pre-PVC prototypes, Valerie ended up making some 400 pairs of plastic pants in her kitchen from parachute nylon and other experimental materials and selling them for five shillings each. In 1948 she and her husband applied for a patent. A breakthrough came when Valerie Hunter Gordon’s father, Sir Vincent de Ferranti, met Sir Robert Robinson, a director of Robinsons of Chesterfield, manufacturer of old-fashioned women’s sanitary belts, and told him about his daughter’s invention.  In 1949, when the family moved to Inverness-shire, Robinsons agreed to start manufacturing the nappies. The pants were patented as a “Paddi”, while the “Paddi Pad” throw-away inserts were made a registered design. An early advertisement for the Paddi Credit: Peter Jolly/Northpix They were not an immediate success. In the frugal postwar years many women found the disposable element of the Paddi wasteful and extravagant, but the idea began to catch on and the product was featured in the Ideal Home Exhibition in 1952.  The BBC then featured the Paddi as one of the six most innovative items of the year and by the end of that year 750,000 packs had been sold. By 1960 sales had reached six million and the royalties contributed to the Hunter Gordons’  increasing household expenditure (they went on to have three more children). Valerie Hunter Gordon travelled up and down the country to the Robinsons headquarters in Chesterfield, fine-tuning designs for Paddi and, later on, designing other products including a similar product for women, the Nikini (with “Nikini Pads”), based on the Paddi concept. Rather to her surprise the Nikini earned more royalties overall than the Paddi, though as she reflected, “there are probably more menstruating women in the world than incontinent babies.” The Paddi brand went into decline in the 1960s with the arrival of Proctor and Gamble’s all-in-one disposable nappy, Pampers. Robinsons fought back with Paddi Cosifits, but were unable to unable to invest sufficiently in marketing to compete with the American product. While the Paddi’s PVC pants could be reused, the Pads were disposable, so few examples of the product in their unused, pristine form still exist. The V&A possesses a pack “found in the donor’s mother’s attic”, observing that “due to their ephemeral nature [they] are quite rare.” Valerie Hunter Gordon with her children (from left to right) Alison, Nigel and Hugh Credit: Universal News (Europe) Valerie Ziani de Ferranti was born at Baslow, Derbyshire, on December 7 1921, the daughter of Sir Vincent de Ferranti and Dorothy Hettie Wilson. Her grandfather, the inventor Sebastian de Ferranti, was the founder of the eponymous family electrical engineering company. She attended the Convent of the Sacred Heart, Woldingham, and in 1940 married Patrick Hunter Gordon, then a lieutenant in the Royal Engineers, who had won an MC earlier in the year after blowing up a bridge under heavy gunfire during the retreat to Dunkirk. He suffered post-traumatic illness and Valerie Hunter Gordon unflaggingly supported him over years of investigation and treatment, shielding her children from crises and developing her products all the while.  She was lunching with Lord Lovat when he joked that her two daughters, in identical tartan dresses, looked like sponge bags In 1959 she designed the family’s hi-tech house in Inverness-shire. It featured electric self-closing curtains and sophisticated heating systems. She constructed a magnificent garden and would do the weeding in an old raincoat she referred to as her “mink”. Valerie Hunter Gordon was rarely satisfied with things as they were; she liked to make improvements. She did not believe, for example, that you could only have one Scottish tartan. She was lunching with Lord Lovat one day when he joked that her two daughters, dressed in identical Gordon tartan dresses, looked like sponge bags.  Determined to find an alternative pattern, she consulted the thread count registers collected by the Highland Society in the 19th century and reconstructed another tartan that was recorded as having been created by Gordon weavers. A lively pattern with shades of pink, red, green and black, it became one of the most popular Gordon tartans worldwide, marketed as Red Gordon. Patrick Hunter Gordon died in a car accident in 1978. Valerie Hunter Gordon is survived by their six children.

The Enquirer/Madison Schmidt Buy Photo Winold Reiss created this mosaic for Union Terminal. It's now re-installed on the west face of the Duke Energy Convention Center. This is a scene from the Aeronautical Corp. of America, which built aircraft at Lunken Airport. (Photo: The Enquirer/Patrick Reddy)Buy Photo He was always larger than life. Even during it, even before artist Winold Reiss forever captured his likeness in the massive mosaic that towers above Central Avenue. John Hentz was a man of few words but many stories. Tales other people told, of course. They still do. And some of those stories – legends, really –  take different shapes depending on who is telling them today. Just take that whole matter of his eye. The one that couldn't see. For his oldest grandson, Don Beck, it was first a battle wound, a scar from his stint in his native Hungary's military. Later, relatives revealed it was actually a mishap with a pair of scissors that stole half of his vision. But Jean Beiting, his only granddaughter, heard whispers that the weapon was something else entirely: a particularly strong batch of his home-brewed wine. Buy Photo Grace Beck (left) talks with her sister-in-law, Jean Beiting, whose grandfather, John Hentz, is depicted working behind her.  (Photo: The Enquirer/Patrick Reddy) But strip away the myths, the murmurs and Hentz was a lot like anyone else living here in the first half of the 20th century. He worked hard and the work was hard. Took his coffee black and his beer cold. Loved to cheer on the Reds from the Crosley Field bleachers – almost as much as he loved to complain about manager Bill McKechnie. That must have been why Hentz caught the German-born artist’s eye when he visited American Oak Leather Co. in 1931, with his sketchbook and camera in hand. All the ways Hentz was common. One of us. That was Reiss's commission from the Union Terminal architects, after all. CINCINNATI.COM Council votes to support murals move With nickel-sized glass tiles and tinted mortar, he was to forge a sparkling monument to the city's laborers. By translating the daily grind into glittering tiles of 8,000 colors, he elevated the tired bodies and rough hands that built this city. These are "real people doing real work," said Cliff Radel, a former reporter who led an Enquirer project identifying the featured workers. All these years later, Hentz – and the 13 other works that are part of what's known as Reiss's industrial or worker murals – are still a symbol of this city. "They represent a lot of the greatness that makes Cincinnati the city that it is, in terms of industrial prowess," said City Manager Harry Black. "These murals capture the ambition, the innovation and the grit that makes Cincinnati what it is today." And as of Thursday, Hentz's depiction and eight other 20-by-20 foot pieces are officially back home. Buy Photo Nine murals created by Winold Reiss in the early 1930s for Union Terminal have been re-installed on the west face of the Duke Energy Convention Center. A dedication ceremony for the display happened Thursday.  (Photo: The Enquirer/Patrick Reddy) After decades hidden in shuttered terminals at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport, nine of these 8-ton masterpieces are now on display on the exterior wall of the Duke Energy Convention Center along Central Avenue. Underneath the Cincinnati sign, men now cut soap in the Procter & Gamble factory again. Another butchers hogs at E. Kahn's & Sons just above the sidewalk. And don't miss the muscle-bound Hentz hunched over his leather roller at American Oak Leather. "They are works of art about the art of hard work," said Radel. And a lot of hard work went into the mural dedication at the convention center, too, he noted. Most recently, the move from CVG to Downtown took months and cost more than $2 million. And it required collaboration between the City of Cincinnati, Kenton County Airport Board in Kentucky and the Convention Facilities Authority of Hamilton County (CFA). But before that, community advocates toiled for decades to protect these nine precious and often displaced pieces of Cincinnati history. They were rescued, for the first time, when the murals moved to the airport in 1973. The Union Terminal train concourse displaying them was set to be demolished. The second save? After officials announced plans to raze the airport terminals, the city rallied to bring them back home. The timing of the celebration at Duke Energy Convention Center Thursday, however, recalled the very beginning of this Cincinnati story, before time and prestige made it history. It was Oct. 20, 1931, that Reiss was getting ready to come to Cincinnati, Radel said. Exactly 85 years ago. He had hotel reservations at the Netherland, just blocks from his murals today.

Read today's eNewspaper News Opinion Editorial An atmosphere of neglect Highlights from the third presidential debate of 2016 Highlights from Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump's third and final debate before the Nov. 8 presidential election. Oct. 20, 2016.  Highlights from Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump's third and final debate before the Nov. 8 presidential election. Oct. 20, 2016.  How did climate change get so ignored in the election? On Wednesday, Maryland lawmakers held a hearing to learn more about an issue of pressing fiscal importance: climate change. A few hours later and 2,500 miles away, the two leading candidates for president engaged in a debate in which the issue was treated as no more than an afterthought. Not only was a question about climate change absent from the stage in Las Vegas but it was never raised in the previous two presidential debates either. How climate change could be regarded as so irrelevant to the presidential contest yet so crucial to state government finances says a lot about the national state of denial and neglect over the harmful effects of man-made greenhouse gas emissions. In Annapolis, what lawmakers heard is that Maryland needs to adjust the investments in the state's $45 billion pension portfolio to minimize its carbon footprint. Why? Not because of some bleeding-heart desire to make the planet a slightly better place (although applying ethical considerations to investment decisions deserves proper consideration, too) but because the future profitability of greenhouse gas polluters looks dismal. That's right, on strictly a dollar and cents calculation, Maryland needs to divest from big polluters like coal, oil, large manufacturing and other companies that rely on fossil fuels. That shouldn't come as too great a shock. Coal mining companies have been filing for bankruptcy faster than Donald Trump's Atlantic City casinos did a decade ago. Other large pension holders have been adding climate change risk experts to manage their portfolios for the same reason. And it isn't just pensions. The adverse effects of climate change have been worrying Wall Street for years. As a recent report notes, insurance companies — property and casualty firms, in particular — have been fretting about worsening climate change risks. As global warming leads to more catastrophic weather, the danger of huge payouts to policyholders has increased, and they, like pensions and other big investors, are putting their money into renewables.

When the Republican nominee for president refused to say he would accept the results of the election, he rattled American democracy and openly flirted with the notion of a contested transition of power. He overshadowed an otherwise... (KATHLEEN HENNESSEY) The list of corporations that are making strategic decisions about their future with an eye to climate change reads like the Dow Jones Industrial Index: Walmart, Procter & Gamble, Johnson & Johnson, Starbucks, Goldman Sachs and on and on. This isn't just some public relations move; farsighted executives see a huge advantage in steering their businesses toward a reduced carbon footprint, either through less energy consumption or greater use of less polluting forms of energy as temperatures rise. Trump, Clinton trade caustic barbs as roast turns bitter JONATHAN LEMIRE The annual Alfred E.

Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner, a white-tie gala in New York that is often the last time the two presidential nominees share a stage before Election Day, is traditionally a time when campaign hostilities are set aside. Not this year. Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton traded... (JONATHAN LEMIRE) Yet despite this surge of activity within corporate leadership and investment communities, the presidential contenders can't be asked over the length of four and a half hours of debate about what the federal government should be doing? Shame on the various moderators for not insisting that Mr. Trump and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton speak directly on such a critically important topic. It's an embarrassment to journalism that the closest anyone got to a climate question was the one about energy-related jobs offered by red-sweater-enthusiast Ken Bone. As it happens, the candidates' positions are no secret. Mr. Trump has said he is not a "big believer" in man-made climate change (even describing it on Twitter as a Chinese hoax) and has attacked the Obama administration's efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions. Ms. Clinton believes the problem is real and a threat to the nation's security. She has supported international agreements to limit emissions (saying in her Democratic nomination acceptance speech that she was proud to have helped shape them) and has pledged to accelerate clean energy deployment. Granted, Maryland's pension investments aren't going to drive national, let alone global, policy on climate change. But it's certainly prudent to make smarter investments, a choice made easier if corporations were required to publicly reveal more about their carbon footprints. That kind of Wall Street reform is not just socially responsible, it's something investors ought to demand. And who should lead the way? That's the proper role of a U.S. president — to not only seek legislative and regulatory relief but to use the bully pulpit of his or her position to call attention to this enormous environmental threat and rally public support behind reasonable solutions. For the record, one candidate appears qualified and prepared to do so and one does not.

REUTERS/Phil Noble/File Photo 1/2 left right The logo of the Unilever group is seen at the Miko factory in Saint-Dizier, France, May 4, 2016. REUTERS/Philippe Wojazer/File Photo 2/2 By Martinne Geller | LONDON LONDON Unilever's push to raise the prices of its brands in Britain in response to a fall in the pound exposed the vulnerabilities of a company - and wider consumer brands industry - that can no longer count on selling more goods to deliver revenue growth. Consumer goods companies have been grappling with slowing volume sales over the past year, hit by falling household spending across the world, fierce competition from retailers' own-brand products and economic weakness in emerging markets. The pound's plunge since the June Brexit vote has put extra pressure on firms like Unilever (ULVR.L), whose brands include Marmite yeast spread and Dove soap, by driving up the cost of their imports to Britain and dollar-traded commodities. Last week the Anglo-Dutch company tried to raise the prices of a range of products by 10 percent in Britain, prompting a stand-off with the country's largest supermarket, Tesco (TSCO.L), which balked at the demand. The dispute - which showed an early effect of Britain's decision to leave the EU - was quickly resolved, but gave the public a rare glimpse into the difficult discussions that industry sources say are happening across the sector. An executive at one of Unilever's main rivals said it was also discussing possible price increases with UK supermarkets. A source at another rival said it faced the same pressures as Unilever but that it was not yet ready to raise prices and first wanted to exhaust cost-cutting options. Spirits company Pernod Ricard (PERP.PA) told Reuters it was planning price increases in Britain too. The Unilever row illustrated how reliant the company is on price rises - rather than increased volume sales - to make more money from shoppers around the world and how difficult that strategy may be to keep up, even as volatile currency and commodity environments drive up costs. The day "Marmitegate" dominated the front pages of British newspapers, the company reported a 3.2 percent rise in quarterly sales - with a 0.4 percent drop in the number of goods sold comfortably offset by a 3.6 percent increase in prices. It is not alone among its peers in this trend of slowing volumes and rising prices. This could put the sector on course for a long battle with big retailers like British supermarkets, which conversely need high sales volumes because of their tight margins and fixed costs, and low prices due to fierce competition in the domestic market. How this conflict might play out is unclear, with the Tesco row perhaps just a taste of what is to come. French food group Danone (DANO.PA), which makes Activia yoghurt and Aptamil baby formula, reported a 0.7 percent fall in third-quarter volumes this week but, like Unilever, used price increases to drive a 2.1 percent rise in sales. Britain's Reckitt Benckiser's (RB.L), which does not break down its sales by volumes and price rises, reported its weakest quarterly growth in over five years on Wednesday. Nestle (NESN.S) also posted its weakest sales growth in more than a decade on Thursday, with volumes slowing. Procter & Gamble (PG.N) reports results next week. Unilever, Reckitt and P&G all declined to comment on any future plans for price increases, while Danone did not respond to a request for comment. WHY UNILEVER? Unilever is the No. 1 supplier of ice cream, deodorants, bath and shower products and margarines and spreads in many countries, and has invested in marketing and brand innovation over the years, which gives it pricing power. But industry experts said the company's request for 10 percent price rises in Britain was aggressive, and that they did not expect its rivals to demand such high increases. "We think all UK food producers are going to need price increases in the next few months but we can't see 10 percent," said Jefferies analyst Martin Deboo. "Unilever's pricing strategy does seem to be about as aggressive as it could be." Unilever said its reliance on price increases was largely down to factors including weak consumer demand in emerging markets and the sharp devaluation of Latin American currencies. It is more exposed to these regions than most of its peers. Emerging markets as a whole account for almost 60 percent of its sales, with Latin America generating 16 percent of sales. Much of the company's third-quarter price rises were to offset currency devaluations in Latin America. It said currency swings globally had made its commodity costs 600 million euros ($659.5 million) more expensive this year, with a large part of that coming from Argentina, Brazil and Mexico. Unilever also said the rise in palm oil and crude prices was driving up the cost of manufacturing skin cleansers and laundry detergents - product categories where it is the dominant player in many markets including Britain. The Tesco dispute and earnings report raised investor concerns about the strength of its business, pushing its shares down more than 6 percent. Trevor Green, head of UK Equities at Unilever shareholder Aviva Investors, expressed confidence in CEO Paul Polman's team, telling Reuters they had done a good job of balancing price and volume growth over the past seven years. Another Unilever investor, Swiss asset management firm GAM, said the fall in sales volumes was tolerable for now. "If it's a quarter or two quarters, I'm not worried," GAM fund manager Xavier Van Hove said. "If it persists for more than four quarters, then yes, I would start to worry."

Quarterly revenue rose by a mere 0.2 percent on an organic basis to 2.32 billion euros ($2.55 billion), held back by the previously-flagged loss of large media accounts in the United States in 2015, but also missing the forecast by a Reuters poll of analysts that predicted growth of 0.97 percent. Publicis Chief Executive Officer Maurice Levy said full-year organic growth in 2017 will be higher than in 2016, but pointed to the economic uncertainties following the British vote to leave the European Union, and surrounding the U.S. presidential election next month. Shares were falling by 5.95 percent at 0808 GMT, on track for their worst day in four-and-a-half months, making Publicis the worst-performer of the French CAC 40 stock index. Publicis shares are up 2.7 percent since January. * Nine-month revenue rose 1.9 percent on an organic basis to 7.07 billion euros * Publicis confirmed full-year guidance for 2016 * The advertising group, the world's third-largest, gained clients such as Wal-Mart, P&G's home care products, Coty and USAA. * Management board will propose to bring forward the 2018 target of a 42 percent payout to 2016. * Levy said total acquisitions in 2017 should be lower than 500 million euros. * Levy, who is slated to leave his position as CEO in 2017, confirmed that the board would make a decision on his successor in February 2017. * Levy said he was ready to take another position in the company's corporate governance to assure a smooth transition, if the board asked him to do so. * American Rival Omnicom said this week that its third-quarter organic sales growth was 3.2 percent. UK-based WPP, the top advertising company in the world, will report third-quarter sales on Oct. 31, while Havas will do the same after market close on Oct. 25.

Third-quarter revenue missed analysts’ estimates, dragged down by the loss of U.S. media-buying accounts like Procter & Gamble Co. and Coca-Cola Co. in the past year. Some U.K. customers in finance and other segments have pulled back because the U.K.’s vote to leave the European Union may hurt business. “We approach 2017 cautiously given the lack of visibility owing to elections in the U.S., France and Germany, and the consequences of Brexit,” for the U.K. and the rest of Europe, Maurice Levy, the company’s 74-year-old chief executive officer, said in a statement. Publicis, whose clients include Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Nestle SA, reported a 0.4 percent decline in sales, to 2.32 billion euros ($2.54 billion), below analysts’ average estimate of 2.33 billion euros. Organic growth, which strips out effects from acquisitions and currency swings, was 0.2 percent, bolstered by advances in digital business in Europe and the Asia Pacific region. The French company warned in April that it would be hit by the loss of several media-buying accounts during the following quarters. That effect has been compounded by projects recently completed at digital ad agency Razorfish, at a time when new ones haven’t reached their full potential yet, Levy said. Sales declined 4 percent in North America in organic terms in the third quarter. Publicis fell as much as 6.5 percent, on track for the biggest loss since Oct. 22, 2015. The stock was down 4.8 percent to 63.8 euros at 3:14 p.m. in Paris. In London, rival WPP Plc lost as much as 3.2 percent -- a read-through from the slump reported by Publicis and the weaker outlook, Charles Bedouelle, an analyst at Exane BNP Paribas, said in an e-mail. At 0.2 percent, organic growth at Publicis was slightly below expectations, and the company’s comments on the fourth quarter and full-year 2017 were circumspect, Bedouelle said in a note to clients.  For more on Maurice Levy and Publicis succession, click here. Although Publicis has decided to keep all its operations in the U.K. following the country’s June 23 vote to leave the European Union, many customers are considering moving London-based operations to continental Europe, “notably in finance but not only,” Levy told reporters. “They are worried that a hard Brexit could close some doors to European markets. They are very cautious.” At recent roadshows and private discussions with the French broker, managers in global advertising have all highlighted their fear that the market was too complacent about Brexit and political risk, Exane BNP Paribas’s Bedouelle said. “None were really seeing major impact yet they were expecting it to hit in 2017,” Bedouelle said. Publicis said it will raise its dividend payout ratio to 42 percent in 2016 from 39.5 percent last year, achieving a target it originally set for 2018. Levy, who has led Publicis into the digital age, plans to step down next year after almost 30 years as CEO. The process of finding a successor will start in November and is expected to be completed by February. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

2016 /PRNewswire/ -- The global 9-decanoic acid methyl ester market is expected to reach USD 240.0 million by 2025, according to a new report. Rising awareness regarding the use of green chemicals coupled with rapidly growing demand for esters in flavors & fragrances industry is likely to boost 9-decanoic acid methyl ester consumption in upcoming years. The increasing number of biorefineries to fulfill ever rising biodiesel and other bio-chemicals' demand is expected to trigger its production over the forecast period. The price for decanoic acid methyl esters is higher than its synthetic counterparts owing to the involvement of specialized processes such as metathesis, which require costly catalysts. Further, these processes are time and energy consuming which in turn leads to high production cost, thus pushing the overall price of product upwards. The flavors & fragrances application segment is predicted to gain traction over the forecast period. The ability of esters to impart fruity flavors is a key factor for their increasing demand in flavors and fragrances industry. The segment is likely to grow an estimated CAGR of 5.0% from 2016 to 2025.

The major averages eventually ended the session on opposite sides of the unchanged line. While the Nasdaq rose 15.57 points or 0.3 percent to 5,257.40, the Dow dipped 16.64 points or 0.1 percent to 18,145.71 and the S&P 500 edged down 0.18 points or less than a tenth of a percent to 2,141.16. For the week, the Dow edged slightly higher, while the S&P 500 climbed by 0.4 and the Nasdaq advanced by 0.8 percent. The tech-heavy Nasdaq benefited from a strong gain by Microsoft (MSFT), with the software giant jumping by 4.3 percent. With the gain, Microsoft reached a record closing high. The advance by shares of Microsoft came after the company's first quarter adjusted earnings per share and revenues exceeded forecasts, helped by a strong performance by its Cloud business. Global payments company PayPal (PYPL) also moved notably higher after reporting third quarter earnings that matched estimates and a growing number of active accounts. Shares of McDonald's (MCD) moved to the upside after the fast food giant reported third quarter earnings and sales that beat analyst estimates. Global same-store sales rose 3.5 percent during the quarter. Meanwhile, General Electric (GE) closed modestly lower after the conglomerate reported third quarter earnings that beat estimates but on lower than expected revenues. GE also lowered its full-year revenue growth forecast. Sector News While many of the major sectors ended the day showing only modest moves, considerable strength was visible among internet stocks. Reflecting the strength in the sector, the Dow Jones Internet Index advanced by 1.8 percent. PayPal helped to lead the sector higher, although j2 Global (JCOM), Twitter (TWTR), and VeriSign (VRSN) also posted notable gains. Tobacco stocks also saw some strength on the day, with Reynolds American (RAI) rising sharply after British American Tobacco (BTI) offered to acquire the 58 percent stake in the company it does not already own for $47 billion. On the other hand, natural gas stocks came under pressure over the course of the session, dragging the NYSE Arca Natural Gas Index down by 1.7 percent. Southwestern Energy (SWN) posted a steep loss after reporting weaker than expected third quarter earnings. Other Markets In overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region moved mostly lower during trading on Friday. Japan's Nikkei 225 Index fell by 0.3 percent, while Australia's All Ordinaries Index dipped by 0.2 percent. The Hong Kong markets were closed for a holiday. Meanwhile, the major European markets ended the day roughly flat. While the German DAX Index inched up by 0.1 percent, the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index and the French CAC 40 Index both edged down by 0.1 percent. In the bond market, treasuries showed a lack of direction before closing roughly flat for the third consecutive session. As a result, the yield on the benchmark ten-year note, which moves opposite of its price, edged down by less than a basis point to 1.740 percent. Looking Ahead Next week's economic calendar is relatively light, but traders are likely to keep an eye on reports on consumer confidence, new home sales, durable goods orders, and third quarter GDP. A slew of well-known companies are also due to release their quarterly results next week as earnings season hits full stride. Visa (V), 3M (MMM), Caterpillar (CAT), General Motors (GM), Procter & Gamble (PG), Sprint (S), AT&T (T), Coca-Cola (KO), Dow Chemical (DOW), Sony (SNE), UPS (UPS), Twitter (TWTR), and Exxon Mobil (XOM) are just a few of the companies due to report their results. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com Business News Preview: Thanksgiving Week Economic Data Top Ten Corporate Comeback Stories The Most Influential Books In Business More Top Stories Fiat Chrysler Recalls Cars For Wiper, Fuel Leak Issues Stocks Move Modestly Lower Amid Quiet Trading Day - U.S. Commentary Dupont Will No Longer Contribute To Pensions Fitch Warns On Trump Trade Policies Stocks Seeing Modest Weakness In Mid-Day Trading - U.S. Commentary Trump Taps Sessions As AG, Pompeo As CIA Director, Flynn As Security Advisor Stocks Showing A Lack Of Direction In Early Trading - U.S. Commentary U.S. Leading Economic Index Inches Higher For Second Straight Month Sen Sessions To Be Attorney General, Gen Flynn Touted As NSA: Reports CFO Shake-up For Actuant Ohio Congressman Challenges Nancy Pelosi For House Dem Leader Japanese Prime Minister Abe Says He Has Great Confidence In Trump Stocks May Show A Lack Of Direction In Early Trading - U.S. Commentary Trump Reportedly Picks Sen.

The evening opened with the national anthem by "The President's Own" United States Marine Band, "God Bless America" by Janine Stange followed by inspiring remarks from the Second Lady of the United States, Dr. Jill Biden. "Our country has one sacred obligation -- to equip those we send to war and to care for them and their families during deployments and when they return home," Biden said. "This commitment to our military and their families is something that you, the USO, does better than anyone else." Gala attendees included the USO Board of Governors, corporate sponsors, senior military officials, honorees and their families. Special guests included members of the 75th Anniversary Honorary Committee including the iconic Ann-Margret along with Trace Adkins, Nigel Barker, Carla Hall, Craig Morgan, Kellie Pickler, Warrick Dunn, Alex Trebek and Miss USA 2016 Deshauna Barber. Together, they collectively represent the talent that donate countless hours to support the USO and entertain American service members around the world. Chef Robert Irvine -- a British Royal Navy veteran and tireless USO supporter -- designed the fall-inspired menu and Ryan Seacrest presided over the evening as master of ceremonies and shared his earnest sentiments about the USO's milestone year. "For 75 years, the USO has delivered programs and services that connect, support, comfort and inspire America's troops and their families wherever they serve," Seacrest said. "As someone with deep and abiding respect for our service men and women and the sacrifices they and their families make every day on behalf of our country -- it has been a tremendous joy and pleasure to share this evening with you." Guests were treated to an exclusive preview of USO's 75th anniversary documentary, "USO - For The Troops," made possible by Johnson & Johnson, the Official Healthcare Partner of the USO. Partisan Pictures' filmmaker and producer Peter Schnall was on hand to lend his support and Courtney Billington, an Army veteran and Johnson & Johnson Vice President of Janssen Supply Chain, invited all who attended to watch the full documentary set to air Nov. 7 on PBS. After a heartfelt tribute to USO celebrity entertainers past and present -- USO CEO and President Dr. J.D. Crouch II took the stage and proudly introduced the USO's new Force Behind the Forces -- a campaign that aims to bridge the military-civilian drift by inviting all Americans to take action in support of service members. "The American people must remain engaged with their military, and our Force Behind the Forces campaign aims to connect the American people to those they serve," Crouch said. "Today's USO -- your USO -- has been 75 years in the making, and our milestones were achieved because of the network of volunteers, partners, corporate donors and service chiefs who have never wavered in supporting this noble cause." The Grammy Award-winning Zac Brown Band delivered a passionate four-song set and spoke about their experiences connecting with service members on USO tours to the war zone. PenFed Credit Union, Deloitte, LLP and the National Football League served as the Chairman's Circle for the evening, and USO leaders acknowledged the many contributors who have donated to the organization's Force Behind the Forces: A $7.5 Million Challenge Campaign -- an effort supporting the expansion and refurbishment of more than 35 USO centers and programs by the end of 2016. Warrick Dunn, a former NFL player and avid USO supporter, announced the NFL recently contributed $5 million to the USO and that a portion will go to the USO's Challenge Campaign. "This funding will help serve more than 125,000 service members and military families, which means a better experience for more than 2 million visitors to USO centers each year," Dunn said. "I hope you will stop and think of the men and women in service tonight. Go back to your families and work places and do what you can to express your personal gratitude." The first award of the evening -- presented by retired Army General George W. Casey, Jr., Chairman of the USO Board of Governors -- went to The Coca-Cola Company, this year's Spirit of the USO Honoree. Coca-Cola has proudly served on the front lines with the USO since World War II, helping provide service members with the kindness, caring, comfort, compassion, encouragement and support they deserve. "Tonight on behalf of all of my Coca-Cola associates, we thank you for this kind award, and we commit to being part of the team for the next 75 years," said J. Alexander M. Douglas Jr., Executive Vice President and President, Coca-Cola North America. The Pritzker Military Museum and Library President and CEO Kenneth Clarke paid special tribute to Janice K. Emmert -- a tireless advocate of the USO's mission for decades. Emmert died in July, and the USO renamed its highest volunteer award in her honor. Two honorees, Ron Meier of the Bob Hope USO in Palm Springs, California, and Ralph Nelsen of USO Osan, South Korea, proudly received the award. Air Force General Paul J. Selva, Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, joined service chiefs and senior military officials to honor six service members from each service branch. Miss USA 2016 Deshauna Barber -- an Army Reserve officer -- presented each service member with their well-deserved award. Selva ended the evening by acknowledging the community of USO supporters and entertainers who serve as the driving force behind the more than 180 networked USO locations worldwide. "If you do the numbers, over 35 million soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines and Coast Guardsmen, and countless family members have been touched by the USO," Selva said. "Those of us who wear the cloth of the nation or stand behind those who wear the cloth of the nation thank you." The USO congratulates its awardees and thanks its sponsors for making its milestone year a success. Click here for more information about the 2016 USO Gala and its honorees.
