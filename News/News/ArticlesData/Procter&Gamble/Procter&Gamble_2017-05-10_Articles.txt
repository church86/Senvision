Combined Company year-over-year change in net revenues is presented giving effect to the completion of the acquisition of the P&G Beauty Business (the „Merger”), as if the Merger had occurred as of July 1, 2015. “NM” indicates calculation not meaningful.   Third Quarter Fiscal 2017 Summary Net revenues of $2,032.1 million increased >100% as reported compared to Legacy-Coty net revenues in the prior-year period and increased 6% at constant currency compared to combined Legacy-Coty and P&G Beauty Business net revenues in the prior-year period Excluding the positive contribution from the acquisitions of ghd and Younique and one month of the Brazil Acquisition, the combined company net revenues declined 2% on a constant currency basis. This performance reflects the benefit of approximately 1% as a result of pre-shipments to customers in advance of the termination of transition services for North America under the Transition Services Agreement („TSA”), which occurred on May 1 Reported operating loss of $(192.5) million decreased from $23.0 million for Legacy-Coty in the prior-year period due to $213.5 million in restructuring and acquisition related charges Adjusted operating income of $208.3 million increased >100% from $102.6 million for Legacy-Coty in the prior-year period Reported net income of $(164.2) million decreased from $(26.8) million for Legacy-Coty in the prior-year period, as Coty initiated its cost savings program with $213.5 million in pre-tax restructuring and acquisition related charges, while adjusted net income of $110.3 million increased from $47.8 million for Legacy-Coty in the prior-year period Reported earnings per diluted share of $(0.22) decreased from $(0.08) for Legacy-Coty in the prior-year period, while adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.15 increased from $0.14 for Legacy-Coty in the prior-year period Net cash provided by operating activities was $43.3 million compared to $(71.8) million in the prior-year period for Legacy-Coty, reflecting improved working capital for the combined company First Nine Months Fiscal 2017 Summary Net revenues of $5,409.0 million increased 65.2% as reported compared to Legacy-Coty net revenues in the prior-year period and was flat on a constant currency basis compared to combined Legacy-Coty and P&G Beauty Business net revenues in the prior-year period Excluding the positive contribution from the acquisitions of ghd, Younique and seven months of the Brazil Acquisition, the combined company net revenues declined 6% on a constant currency basis Reported operating loss of $(158.8) million decreased from $257.1 million for Legacy-Coty in the prior-year period due to $454.1 million in restructuring and acquisition related charges Adjusted operating income of $682.7 million increased 29% from $528.7 million for Legacy-Coty in the prior-year period Reported net income of $(117.4) million decreased from $187.9 million for Legacy-Coty in the prior-year period due to $454.1 million in pre-tax restructuring and acquisition related charges, while adjusted net income of $411.9 million increased from $439.5 million for Legacy-Coty in the prior-year period Reported earnings per diluted share of $(0.19) decreased from $0.53 for Legacy-Coty in the prior-year period, while adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.67 decreased from $1.23 for Legacy-Coty in the prior-year period Net cash provided by operating activities was $706.7 million compared to $445.3 million in the prior-year period, primarily as a result of improved working capital for the combined company partially offset by lower cash-related net income Commenting on Q3 financial results and strategic outlook, Camillo Pane, Coty CEO said: “Q3 was a better quarter. The underlying net revenue trend, excluding the contributions from ghd, Younique and one month of the Brazil Acquisition, improved sequentially to -2% at constant currency compared to a high single digit decline in the first half. This improvement was driven by good growth performance in the Luxury division, flat performance in Professional Beauty, and some improvement but continued negative performance in the Consumer Beauty division. Equally encouraging was the performance of our acquired businesses of the Brazil acquisition, Younique and ghd. These three businesses combined showed strong performance year over year, outperforming their respective markets and are expected to materially strengthen the growth profile of the total company. As to profits, our Q3 performance was very solid, with our adjusted operating income more than doubling in Q3 versus the prior year period, underlining the margin strength of our business. It is clear that fiscal 2017 is a transitional year and the path to recovery will take some time and will not be a straight line. For example, we expect the constant currency net revenue trends in Q4 excluding Younique and ghd to weaken sequentially versus Q3. In Q3, we continued to execute on the strategy I outlined last quarter to position Coty to become a challenger and leader in beauty, and drive sustained profitable growth over time. We aim to achieve these strategic objectives through four key pillars, specifically the repositioning some of the brands, making significant changes to our innovation and product development process, accelerating our end-to-end digital transformation including e-commerce, and revamping our in-store execution. I am pleased with the progress made in the quarter on the four pillars, especially on the announced partnerships with new creative agencies and the implementation of changes to our innovation process. On the integration of the P&G Beauty Business, we are making good progress and we just exited the Transitional Services Agreement in North America on May 1, which is a significant milestone in this journey. Regarding acquisitions, the recently announced agreement to acquire the long term exclusive license of the Burberry Beauty business should further strengthen our Luxury portfolio of brands without a material impact to our leverage ratio, highlighting our disciplined approach to valuation, and maintaining a strong balance sheet. In sum, I am confident that the strategies and action plans we are deploying throughout the organization are setting the stage to realize the enormous potential of Coty as a global leader and challenger in beauty.” Basis of Presentation and Exceptional Items To supplement financial results presented in accordance with GAAP, certain financial information is presented herein using the non-GAAP financial measures described in this section. The term “combined company” describes net revenues of Coty Inc. and the P&G Beauty Business giving effect to the Merger for purposes of the three and nine months ended March 31, 2017 as if it had occurred on July 1, 2015. Combined company year-over-year and combined company constant currency year-over-year do not include any adjustments related to potential profit improvements, potential cost savings or adjustments to fully conform to the accounting policies of Coty. The term “combined company constant currency” describes the combined company net revenues excluding the effect of foreign currency exchange translations. The term “adjusted” primarily excludes the impact of restructuring and business realignment costs, amortization, costs related to acquisition activities, private company share-based compensation expense, and asset impairment charges to the extent applicable. Refer to “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for additional discussion of these measures as well as the definition of free cash flow. Net revenues are reported by segment and geographic region and are discussed below on a reported (GAAP) basis and combined company constant currency basis. Operating income is reported by segment. All changes in margin percentage are described in basis points rounded to the nearest tenth of a percent. Net revenues are presented on an actual, combined company and combined company constant currency. Operating income, net income, operating income margin, gross margin, effective tax rate, and earnings per diluted share (EPS (diluted)) are presented on a reported (GAAP) basis and an adjusted (non-GAAP) basis. Adjusted EPS (diluted) is a performance measure and should not be construed as a measure of liquidity. Net revenues on a combined company basis, net revenues on a combined company constant currency basis, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating income on a constant currency basis, adjusted operating income margin, adjusted effective tax rate, adjusted net income, adjusted gross margin, adjusted EPS (diluted) and free cash flow are non-GAAP financial measures. Refer to „Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for additional discussion of these measures. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results can be found in the tables and footnotes at the end of this release. Coty only provides guidance on a non-GAAP basis and does not provide reconciliations of such forward-looking non-GAAP measures to GAAP due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying certain amounts that are necessary for such reconciliation, including adjustments that could be made for restructuring, integration and acquisition-related expenses, amortization expenses, adjustments to inventory, and other charges reflected in our reconciliation of historic numbers, the amount of which, based on historical experience, could be significant. Third Quarter Fiscal 2017 Summary Operating Review Net revenues of $2,032.1 million increased >100% as reported compared to Legacy-Coty net revenues in the prior-year period and increased 6% at constant currency compared to combined Legacy-Coty and P&G Beauty Business net revenues in the prior-year period. The 6% constant currency net revenue growth compared to the combined company revenues in the prior-year period reflected an 8% contribution from ghd, Younique, and one month of the Brazil Acquisition, and a 2% decline in the underlying business. The sequential improvement in the underlying revenue performance was driven by growth in the Luxury division, flat performance in Professional Beauty, with continued underlying challenges in the Consumer Beauty division that were partially offset by strong performance in Brazil. Q3 trends reflect the benefit of approximately 1% as a result of pre-shipments to customers in advance of the termination of transition services for North America under the TSA, which occurred on May 1. Gross margin of 59.8% decreased from 61.2% for Legacy-Coty in the prior-year period, while adjusted gross margin of 63.3% increased from 61.8% for Legacy-Coty in the prior-year period, reflecting the addition of the higher gross margin P&G Beauty and Younique businesses. Operating income decreased to $(192.5) million from $23.0 million for Legacy-Coty in the prior-year period, as the income contribution from the acquired businesses was more than offset by increased restructuring costs and acquisition related costs. As a percentage of net revenues, operating margin decreased to (9.5)% from 2.4%. Adjusted operating income increased >100% to $208.3 million from $102.6 million for Legacy-Coty in the prior-year period, reflecting the profit contribution from P&G Beauty Business and Younique. As a percentage of net revenues, adjusted operating margin remained flat at 10.3% at actual rates. Reported effective tax rate was 36.9% compared to (133.3)% for Legacy-Coty in the prior-year period. Adjusted effective tax rate was 22.2% compared to 25.1% for Legacy-Coty in the prior-year period. Net income decreased to $(164.2) million from $(26.8) million for Legacy-Coty in the prior-year period, reflecting lower operating income and higher interest expense. Adjusted net income increased to $110.3 million from $47.8 million for Legacy-Coty in the prior-year period, primarily reflecting higher adjusted operating income partially offset by higher interest expense. As a percentage of net revenues, adjusted net income margin increased to 5.4% from 5.0% in the prior-year period. Cash Flows Net cash provided by operating activities in the quarter was $43.3 million, compared to $(71.8) million for Legacy-Coty in the prior-year period, reflecting improved working capital for the combined company. Free cash flow was $(82.5) million in the quarter compared to $(108.6) million for Legacy-Coty in the prior-year period, reflecting higher cash from operations partially offset by increased capital expenditure. On March 10, 2017, the Company paid a quarterly dividend of $0.125 per share for a total of $93.4 million. Cash and cash equivalents of $767.0 million increased by $394.6 million, total debt of $7,184.8 million increased by $3,014.7 million, with net debt of $6,417.8 million up $2,620.1 million from the balance on June 30, 2016. This increase reflected the assumption of approximately $1,941.8 million of debt as part of the P&G Beauty Business transaction and financings for the acquisition of ghd and the investment in Younique.   Third Quarter Fiscal 2017 Business Review by Segment     Three Months Ended March 31, Net Revenues   Change   Reported Operating Income   Adjusted Operating Income   Actual   Combined   Combined       Year – Company Company over – Year- Constant (in millions) 2017 2016 Year Over-Year   Currency 2017   Change   2017 Change Luxury $ 634.6 $ 405.9 56 % 1 % 2 % $ 60.9 >100% $ 86.1 94 % Consumer Beauty 988.6 488.5 >100% 5 % 5 % 63.0 61 % 121.5 >100% Professional 408.9 56.3 > 100% 11 % 14 % (18.2 ) NM 0.7 (95 %) Corporate —   —   N/A   N/A     N/A   (298.2 ) NM   —   N/A   Total $ 2,032.1   $ 950.7   >100% 5 %   6 % $ (192.5 ) NM   $ 208.3   >100%   Luxury Luxury net revenues of $634.6 million increased 56% as reported compared to Legacy-Coty net revenues in the prior-year period reflecting the contribution from the acquired P&G Beauty Business. Luxury net revenues increased 2% at constant currency compared to combined Legacy-Coty and P&G Beauty Business net revenues in the prior-year period, reflecting revenue momentum in several brands including Hugo Boss, Calvin Klein, and Chloe behind strong launch activity in the quarter partially offset by declines in philosophy and Marc Jacobs. Adjusted operating income for Luxury increased 94% to $86.1 million from $44.4 million in the prior-year period, resulting in a 13.6% adjusted operating income margin, an increase of 270 basis points versus Legacy-Coty in the prior-year period. Consumer Beauty Consumer Beauty net revenues of $988.6 million increased >100% as reported compared to Legacy-Coty net revenues in the prior-year period reflecting the contribution from the acquired P&G Beauty Business and Younique. Consumer Beauty net revenues grew 5% at constant currency compared to combined Legacy-Coty and P&G Beauty Business net revenues in the prior-year period, reflecting a 11% contribution from Younique and one month of the Brazil Acquisition, and a 6% decline in the underlying business. This decline reflected an improvement relative to the trends in the first half FY17, driven by continued underlying challenges in the Consumer Beauty division that were partially offset by strong performance in Brazil. Adjusted operating income for Consumer Beauty increased >100% to $121.5 million from $43.2 million for Legacy-Coty in the prior-year period, resulting in an 12.3% adjusted operating income margin, an increase of 350 basis points versus Legacy-Coty in the prior-year period. Professional Professional Beauty net revenues of $408.9 million increased > 100% as reported compared to Legacy-Coty net revenues in the prior-year period reflecting the contribution from the acquired P&G Beauty Business and the ghd acquisition. Professional Beauty net revenues increased 14% at constant currency compared to combined Legacy-Coty and P&G Beauty Business net revenues in the prior-year period, reflecting a 14% contribution from ghd, and strength in professional hair offset by declines in OPI. Adjusted operating income for Professional decreased to $0.7 million from $15.0 million for Legacy-Coty in the prior-year period, resulting in a 0.2% adjusted operating income margin versus 26.6% for Legacy-Coty in the prior-year period as the seasonally weak period in the Salon market weighed on the margin profiles of both Salon Hair and ghd.   Third Quarter Fiscal 2017 Business Review by Geographic Region   Three Months Ended March 31, Net Revenues   Change     Combined   Combined Company Company Reported Year-Over- Constant (in millions) 2017 2016 Basis Year Currency North America $ 685.1 $ 311.1 >100% 3% 4% Europe 848.4 402.0 >100% —% 4% ALMEA 498.6   237.6   >100% 17% 13% Total $ 2,032.1   $ 950.7   >100% 5%   6%   North America Reported net revenues increased >100% compared to Legacy-Coty net revenues in the prior-year period and increased 4% at constant currency compared to combined Coty and P&G Beauty Business net revenues in the prior-year period driven primarily by the contribution from Younique, partially offset by declines in the U.S., primarily in the Consumer Beauty division.

All forward-looking statements made in this release are qualified by these cautionary statements. These forward-looking statements are made only as of the date of this release, and the Company does not undertake any obligation, other than as may be required by law, to update or revise any forward-looking or cautionary statements to reflect changes in assumptions, the occurrence of events, unanticipated or otherwise, or changes in future operating results over time or otherwise. Comparisons of results for current and any prior periods are not intended to express any future trends or indications of future performance unless expressed as such, and should only be viewed as historical data. Non-GAAP Financial Measures The Company operates on a global basis, with the majority of net revenues generated outside of the U.S. Accordingly, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can affect results of operations. Therefore, to supplement financial results presented in accordance with GAAP, certain financial information is presented excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange translations to provide a framework for assessing how the underlying businesses performed excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange translations (“constant currency”). Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period-over-period, with the current period’s results calculated at the prior-year period’s rates. The Company calculates constant currency information by translating current and prior-period results for entities reporting in currencies other than U.S. dollars into U.S. dollars using constant foreign currency exchange rates. The constant currency calculations do not adjust for the impact of revaluing specific transactions denominated in a currency that is different to the functional currency of that entity when exchange rates fluctuate. The constant currency information presented may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. The Company discloses the following constant currency financial measures: combined company net revenues and adjusted operating income. The Company presents year-over-year comparisons of net revenues on a combined company and combined company constant currency basis. The Company believes that combined company year-over-year and combined company constant currency year-over-year better enable management and investors to analyze and compare the Company’s net revenues performance from period to period, as the total business and individual divisions are being managed on a combined company basis. In the periods described in this release, combined company year-over-year and combined company constant currency year-over-year give effect to the completion of the Merger for purposes of the three months and nine months ended March 31, 2017 as if it has been completed on July 1, 2015. Combined company growth and combined company constant currency growth do not include any adjustments related to potential profit improvements, potential cost savings or adjustments to fully conform to the accounting policies of Coty. For reconciliation of combined company year-over-year, combined company constant currency year-over-year, and combined company constant currency organic sales (LFL) year-over-year, see the table entitled “Reconciliation of Reported Net Revenues to Combined Company Net Revenues.” For a reconciliation of the Company’s combined company year-over-year, combined company constant currency year-over-year and combined company constant currency excluding the impact of acquisitions other than the acquisition of the P&G Beauty Business by segment and geographic region, see the tables entitled “Net Revenues and Adjusted Operating Income by Segment” and “Net Revenues by Geographic Regions.” The Company presents operating income, operating income margin, gross margin, effective tax rate, net income, net income margin, net revenues and EPS (diluted) on a non-GAAP basis and specifies that these measures are non-GAAP by using the term “adjusted”. The Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures better enable management and investors to analyze and compare operating performance from period to period. In calculating adjusted operating income, operating income margin, gross margin, effective tax rate, net income, net income margin and EPS (diluted), the Company excludes following items: Costs related to acquisition activities: The Company excludes acquisition-related costs and acquisition accounting impacts such as those related to transaction costs and costs associated with the revaluation of acquired inventory in connection with business combinations because these costs are unique to each transaction. The nature and amount of such costs vary significantly based on the size and timing of the acquisitions and the maturities of the businesses being acquired. Also, the size, complexity and/or volume of past acquisitions, which often drives the magnitude of such expenses, may not be indicative of the size, complexity and/or volume of any future acquisitions. Restructuring and other business realignment costs: The Company excludes costs associated with restructuring and business structure realignment programs to allow for comparable financial results to historical operations and forward-looking guidance. In addition, the nature and amount of such charges vary significantly based on the size and timing of the programs. By excluding the above referenced expenses from the non-GAAP financial measures, management is able to evaluate the Company’s ability to utilize existing assets and estimate their long-term value. Furthermore, management believes that the adjustment of these items supplement the GAAP information with a measure that can be used to assess the sustainability of the Company’s operating performance. Amortization expense: The Company excludes the impact of amortization of finite-lived intangible assets, as such non-cash amounts are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are significantly impacted by the timing and/or size of acquisitions. Management believes that the adjustment of these items supplement the GAAP information with a measure that can be used to assess the sustainability of the Company’s operating performance. Although the Company excludes amortization of intangible assets from the non-GAAP expenses, management believes that it is important for investors to understand that such intangible assets contribute to revenue generation. Amortization of intangible assets that relate to past acquisitions will recur in future periods until such intangible assets have been fully amortized. Any future acquisitions may result in the amortization of additional intangible assets. Asset impairment charges: The Company excludes the impact of asset impairments as such non-cash amounts are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are significantly impacted by the timing and/or size of acquisitions. Management believes that the adjustment of these items supplement the GAAP information with a measure that can be used to assess the sustainability of the Company’s operating performance. Share-based compensation adjustment: The Company excludes the impact of the fiscal 2013 accounting modification from liability plan to equity plan accounting for the share-based compensation plans as well as other share-based compensation transactions that are not reflective of the ongoing and planned pattern of recognition for such expense. Refer to “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” contained in the respective forms filed with the SEC for a full discussion of the share-based compensation adjustment. Interest and other (income) expense: The Company excludes foreign currency impacts associated with acquisition-related and debt financing related forward contracts as the nature and amount of such charges are not consistent and are significantly impacted by the timing and size of such transactions. Loss on early extinguishment of debt: The Company excludes the loss on extinguishment of debt as this represents a non-cash charge, and the amount and frequency of such charges is not consistent and is significantly impacted by the timing and size of debt financing transactions. Tax: This adjustment represents the impact of the tax effect of the pretax items excluded from Adjusted net income. The tax impact of the non-GAAP adjustments are based on the tax rates related to the jurisdiction in which the adjusted items are received or incurred. The Company has provided a quantitative reconciliation of the difference between the non-GAAP financial measures and the financial measures calculated and reported in accordance with GAAP. For a reconciliation of adjusted gross margin to gross margin, adjusted EPS (diluted) to EPS (diluted), and adjusted net revenues to net revenues, see the table entitled “Reconciliation of Reported to Adjusted Results for the Consolidated Statements of Operations.” For a reconciliation of adjusted operating income to operating income and adjusted operating income margin to operating income margin, see the tables entitled “Reconciliation of Reported Operating Income to Adjusted Operating Income” and „Reconciliation of Reported Operating Income to Adjusted Operating Income by Segment.” For a reconciliation of adjusted effective tax rate and adjusted cash tax rate to effective tax rate, see the table entitled “Reconciliation of Reported Income Before Income Taxes and Effective Tax Rates to Adjusted Income Before Income Taxes, Effective Tax Rates and Cash Tax Rates.” For a reconciliation of adjusted net income and adjusted net income margin to net income, see the table entitled “Reconciliation of Reported Net Income to Adjusted Net Income.” The Company also presents free cash flow. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities, less capital expenditures. Free cash flow excludes cash used for private company stock option exercises and cash used for acquisitions. Management believes that free cash flow is useful for investors because it provides them with an important perspective on the cash available for debt repayment and other strategic measures, after making necessary capital investments in property and equipment to support the Company’s ongoing business operations, and provides them with the same measures that management uses as the basis for making resource allocation decisions. For a reconciliation of Free Cash Flow, see the table entitled “Reconciliation of Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities to Free Cash Flow.” These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. – Tables Follow – COTY INC. & SUBSIDIARIES CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS (Unaudited)     Three Months Ended March 31, Nine Months Ended March 31, (in millions, except per share data) 2017   2016 2017   2016 Net revenues $ 2,032.1 $ 950.7 $ 5,409.0 $ 3,273.5 Cost of sales 816.1   369.0   2,153.2   1,280.4   as % of Net revenues 40.2 % 38.8 % 39.8 % 39.1 % Gross profit 1,216.0 581.7 3,255.8 1,993.1 Gross margin 59.8 % 61.2 % 60.2 % 60.9 %   Selling, general and administrative expenses 1,092.4 494.2 2,741.5 1,493.9 as % of Net revenues 53.8 % 52.0 % 50.7 % 45.6 % Amortization expense 102.6 20.9 219.0 59.0 Restructuring costs 155.8 6.6 179.0 79.3 Acquisition-related costs 57.7 37.0 275.1 98.3 Asset impairment charges —   —   —   5.5   Operating (loss) income (192.5 ) 23.0 (158.8 ) 257.1 as % of Net revenues (9.5 %) 2.4 % (2.9 %) 7.9 % Interest expense, net 60.8 25.1 159.1 55.7 Loss on extinguishment of debt — — — 3.1 Other (income) expense, net (0.5 ) 6.6   0.2   30.4   (Loss) income before income taxes (252.8 ) (8.7 ) (318.1 ) 167.9 as % of Net revenues (12.4 %) (0.9 %) (5.9 %) 5.1 % (Benefit) provision for income taxes (93.4 ) 11.6   (220.6 ) (42.5 ) Net income (159.4 ) (20.3 ) (97.5 ) 210.4 as % of Net revenues (7.8 %) (2.1 %) (1.8 %) 6.4 % Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 3.5 2.4 14.2 12.1 Net income attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests 1.3   4.1   5.7   10.4   Net income attributable to Coty Inc. $ (164.2 ) $ (26.8 ) $ (117.4 ) $ 187.9   as % of Net revenues (8.1 %) (2.8 %) (2.2 %) 5.7 % Net income attributable to Coty Inc. per common share: Basic $ (0.22 ) $ (0.08 ) $ (0.19 ) $ 0.54 Diluted $ (0.22 ) $ (0.08 ) $ (0.19 ) $ 0.53 Weighted-average common shares outstanding: Basic 747.3 337.9 607.9 347.8 Diluted 747.3 337.9 607.9 356.9   Cash dividend declared per common share $ 0.125 $ — $ 0.525 $ 0.250     COTY INC.

Time Handout from Gillette (Photo: Gillette) 4 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE CINCINNATI — Procter & Gamble has overhauled its online Gillette business, offering customers the new option of on-demand purchases or the traditional subscription service. Previously called the Gillette Shave Club, P&G has redubbed the unit Gillette On Demand. To order new cartridges, customers need only text the word "BLADES." P&G, which cut its razor prices this spring to better compete with online rivals such as Dollar Shave Club and Harry's, is aggressively courting subscription customers frustrated with getting too many blades in the mail. The company's research says 41% of former subscription customers complain they got more blades than they needed. “Gillette On Demand’s as-needed ordering capabilities and its convenient subscription options give guys smart choices, not trade-offs," said Mark Jeffreys, Gillette's brand director. "This new service puts them in control without having to choose between convenience and flexibility, or between great quality and value." Lori Powers, CEO of local marketing firm the Powers Agency, said it was telling Gillette renamed its digital razor business to stress its flexibility to offer razors without a subscription. Powers' agency is not involved with the P&G initiative. "They're trying to one-up their competition," Powers said, adding the consumer products giant was also clearly courting digitally-centric and convenience-obsessed Millennial customers making blades available via a one-word text message. "Texting is a fantastic way to engage Millennials," Powers added. "Their generation grew up with this type of convenience. It's not just nice to have, they expect this." P&G is under pressure to preserve Gillette's market dominance as recent sales data has shown customers inclined to buy cheaper products. Company executives also bemoan more men growing facial hair. In February, company officials announced that some Gillette prices would drop as much as 20% depending on the product and pack size, while other razors will see no change in price. Officials said the change came as P&G sees gaps between its highest-priced razors and lower-tier products. Online sales — both directly by P&G, but also by retailers selling their products — are a growing part of company sales. Last month, P&G executives disclosed online sales of all brands now account for 5% of total revenue or more than $3 billion. Gillette anchors P&G's $6.8 billion grooming business that includes other razor brands, such as Fusion, Mach3, Prestobarba and Venus and electric shaver brand Braun. Worldwide, P&G's shaving business enjoys nearly a 65% share of the market. 4 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2q31rlN

Ya Libnan Lebanon News and World News Live from Beirut Featured News Lebanon News World News Opinion Business News Arts & Culture Sci & Tech Video Apple’s cash pile of $250 billion fuels expectations April 30, 2017 by yalibnan 3 Comments In its quarterly results on Tuesday, Apple Inc. likely will report that its cash hoard has topped a quarter of a trillion dollars, an unrivaled milestone for a private corporation that raises a question: Why would any company want to hold that much money? Apple has added to its pile at a blistering pace, doubling it in just over four-and-a-half years. In the last three months of 2016 it wracked up new cash at a rate of about $3.6 million an hour. Its current total, not accounting for debt, exceeds the market values of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and that of Procter & Gamble Co., and outstrips the foreign-currency reserves of the U.K. and Canada combined. The stash has drawn fresh attention recently as President Donald Trump tries to revamp the U.S. tax regime. Apple, like many big companies, keeps most of its cash offshore — some 93% of its $246.09 billion total cash, cash equivalents, and securities as of December — to avoid U.S. corporate taxes that executives consider too high. The Trump administration this week proposed a one-time tax holiday to encourage companies to bring that cash home, and said it wants to slash the U.S. corporate-income-tax rate to 15% from 35% and largely exempt future foreign profits. That could make it easier for Apple to put its money to use, through acquisitions or by doling out more to shareholders. The latter prospect has propelled Apple’s stock to record highs. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook early this year said he was eager to bring cash home if tax changes enable it, and Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said such a move would give Apple flexibility to do more capital returns. Neither has given detailed plans. One possible approach would be a special dividend. Apple could deliver such a windfall, benefitting investors including Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc., which more than doubled its Apple position in January. Wall Street analysts tend to focus more on companies’ net cash position than the headline number. Apple has racked up some $88 billion in debt to fund payouts to shareholders. But even subtracting that, Apple would be left with more cash than the total stockpile of Microsoft, the next richest tech company, which boasts $126 billion in cash, not accounting for debt. With the exception of financial companies, Apple’s stash exceeds that of any other U.S. company in recent history, said Jennifer Blouin, an accounting professor at University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School. “I have never seen a company in this kind of extreme position, barring a winding-down,” she said. “Apple’s a cash box right now.” Former executives say Apple’s thrift has deep roots, inspired in part by a brush with bankruptcy in the late 1990s. That forced Chief Executive Steve Jobs to arrange a cash infusion from Microsoft Corp. and set his resolve to keep reserves for future emergencies. Mr. Jobs also believed Apple could better boost its stock price by using its money to develop new products than through buybacks or dividends. His biggest product, the iPhone, has only supercharged the cash machine. Apple has sold more than 1 billion of the devices in the decade since it was introduced, and today claims 91% of all the profits in the smartphone sector. Mr. Cook has been somewhat more accommodating of shareholder desires than his predecessor. He started a dividend-and-stock-buyback program in 2012 that has since sent more than $200 billion to shareholders. And he has invested more in some areas, such as R&D. But the CEO also stared down Carl Icahn in 2013 and 2014 when the activist investor bought a stake in Apple and demanded it increase buybacks. And Apple remains frugal in other realms, such as marketing. It spent less than $1.8 billion on advertising last year — not even half the amounts laid out by smaller rivals Alphabet Inc. and Amazon.com Inc., according to company filings. Apple also avoids large acquisitions. It bought at a rate of 15 to 20 companies a year over the past four years, generally spending several hundred million dollars on companies it can easily assimilate. Its biggest deal was the $3 billion it spent to buy Beats Electronics LLC in 2014. The swelling war chest has fueled hopes for bigger deals to vault Apple in new directions such as self-driving cars and entertainment. At Apple’s 2015 shareholder meeting, one investor asked Mr. Cook about buying Tesla Inc., which today is valued around $51 billion. The CEO didn’t directly respond. Robert Nichols of Windward Capital Management Co., an Apple shareholder, says it should buy Netflix Inc., valued around $65 billion, to jumpstart its video-streaming business and bolster its position against Amazon. “You can either build [content and distribution] or you can buy it,” and buying would help Apple gain ground where it is behind, he said. With $250 billion, Apple could buy both Tesla and Netflix and still have plenty left over. It also might want to use some cash to pay down some of its debt or look to boost U.S. manufacturing after facing calls last year from then-President-elect Trump to build a plant in the U.S. Either way, there is a growing sense that Apple’s cash hoard has far outstripped its needs. “If this a rainy day fund, they’re saving for a millennial flood,” said Lee Pinkowitz, a Georgetown University professor of finance.   FOX Filed Under: Business News vs Facebook tries to fix violent video problem with 3,000 new workers http://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-crime-idUSKBN17Z1N4 elie meanwhile chinese are working under shitty conditions in apple factories.

Jumped Today The beauty company got a boost after reporting a strong start to 2017. Here's what to watch for the rest of the year. Seth McNew (TMFMcNew) May 10, 2017 at 1:24PM What happened Shares of Coty Inc. (NYSE:COTY) surged as much as 15% in early trading today after the company reported better-than-expected fiscal third-quarter earnings, including increased confidence in the rest of its fiscal year.  So what  For the quarter, Coty posted sales grew more than 100%, as a result of the acquisition of 44 beauty brands from Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) in late 2016 On a combined company basis, adjusting for the added PG Beauty brand's year-over-year growth, sales were still up about 5%. However, even that takes into account a few other small acquisitions, and excluding those, sales were down 2% over the same period in 2016. The company reported a loss of $0.22, which is down from the $0.08 loss in the same period last year. Most of that looks like a rough quarter, but Coty's adjusted income of $0.15 per share was better than analysts had expected -- hence today's stock rise.  Image source: Coty Inc. Now what Coty management has expressed confidence throughout the year, even as adjusted sales continue to lag. In this release, CEO Camillo Pane spoke candidly in the earnings release, saying that 2017 was "a transitional year and the path to recovery will take some time and will not be a straight line." Still, Pane believes that the sales trend is improving: Q3 was a better quarter. The underlying net revenue trend, excluding the contributions from ghd, Younique and one month of the Brazil Acquisition, improved sequentially to -2% at constant currency compared to a high single digit decline in the first half. This improvement was driven by good growth performance in the Luxury division, flat performance in Professional Beauty, and some improvement but continued negative performance in the Consumer Beauty division. Management plans to continue to invest in product development, revamp its in-store experience, and accelerate its e-commerce distribution. Even though this fiscal year has been mixed, the company has been very bullish on its long-term growth, reporting in its first-quarter earnings that it anticipates 2020 earnings per share of $1.53, which would be three times higher than reported fiscal 2016 EPS.   Seth McNew has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Alts Equities Smart-Beta New ETFs ETF Ecosystem Webcasts ETF Newsletter Video Podcasts ETF Strategist Channel Smart Beta Channel Search You Are Here: Home → 2017 → May → A Dividend ETF to Lean On for Consistency A Dividend ETF to Lean On for Consistency May 10, 2017 at 12:42 pm by Brenton Garen The Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF (NYSEArca: VIG) is the largest dividend exchange traded fund trading in the U.S. In addition to its low fee, one of the lowest among U.S. dividend ETFs, investors love VIG for its dividend consistency. In a sign that plenty of VIG’s 180 holdings have dividend increase well in excess of 10 years, some of the fund’s marquee holdings, including Dow components Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) and Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG), are dividend aristocrats. Dividend aristocrats are those S&P 500 members that have increased dividends for at least 25 consecutive years. VIG targets U.S. stocks that have increased dividends on a regular basis for at least 10 consecutive years. Company stocks that issue high dividend yields can be masking their distressed books or may not be sustainable and are heading for dividend cuts. Consequently, these quality dividend ETFs try to limit the impact of these value traps by requiring a history of sustainable dividend growth. VIG tracks the NASDAQ US Dividend Achievers Select Index (formerly known as the Dividend Achievers Select Index). “This index is a subset of the NASDAQ US Broad Dividend Achievers Index and is administered exclusively for Vanguard by NASDAQ. The fund attempts to replicate the target index by investing all, or substantially all, of its assets in the stocks that make up the index, holding each stock in approximately the same proportion as its weighting in the index,” according to Vanguard. Given President Donald Donald Trump’s campaign promises, the markets believe a Trump administration could foster growth and fuel inflationary pressures, adding to speculation that the Fed would hike interest rates to rein in an overheating economy. Consequently, many expect higher yields and a steeper yield curve are on the horizon. While income seekers may welcome the prospects, bond market yields may continue to remain in the low end of the spectrum. Many of VIG’s sector allocations could actually prove sturdy in a rising rates environment whereas some high dividend strategies could be vulnerable. “VIG is run with an intelligent design and it emphasizes stronger companies. Even if the companies may be expensive today, it’s a good place for investors to buy in the event the market starts to decline and there’s a comfortable price point for entry,” according to a Seeking Alpha analysis of VIG.

The BBC presenter revealed how she and husband Kenny, a former rugby player,  ditched a formal chat in favour of an 'ongoing conversation' with their 11-year-old twins about puberty and growing up - and urged other parents to do the same. 'It doesn't have to be a serious sit down an "I have something important to tell you",' she said in an interview with FEMAIL. 'You could scare a child.' The 43-year-old said the key is to find ways to get your child to open up, explaining that while her daughter Lois is confident asking about periods and shaving, her son Reuben can be more reserved. 'It is about learning what buttons to press,' she said. Gabby also spoke about her and Kenny's decision to not give their children mobile phones, saying she did not want them to become 'fixated' on their screens or to think it's the 'only way to communicate'. But she admitted it couldn't last forever. Open: Gabby Logan said she spoke to daughter Lois, pictured, about puberty and periods Family: Gabby, centre, on holiday with husband Kenny, son Reuben and daughter Lois Research by Boots and P&G revealed that nearly 70 per cent of parents find it difficult to talk about puberty with their teenagers while one in five are unsure about how to start.  For Gabby, it was important for her children to know they could ask questions about anything. 'Children I think are much more candid today,' she said.  'I don't think I could have talked to my parents in the way my children talk to me.'

And she is asking about moods and hormones.  'She started to ask about shaving her legs when her leg hair got a little bit more noticeable, you know because they see you doing it.' Protecting their children: Gabby and Kenny have not given their children mobile phones With Reuben, Gabby takes a different approach. 'Reuben can be really surly and moody,' she continued. 'I find the best way into a conversation with him is asking him about his lunch. It then leads into other things.'  HOW TO HAVE 'THE TALK': GABBY'S TIPS Be open 'The talk' can be an 'ongoing discussion' rather than a sit-down chat. Just ask Gabby said: 'It is important for them to feel like they are contributing, asking questions. You could ask them to think about what they want to know,' and take it from there.  Use the TV  TV shows, magazines and the radio can be a great way to introduce topics to the conversation.  Share your experience It is important for children to know that they are not experiencing puberty alone. Gabby said: 'Make sure they understand that you went through it and that they are not going through it in isolation.  'I spent so much time worrying about puberty... I don't want my daughter or son spending time worrying about they can't put off or avoid.'   Gabby, who along with daughter Lois has partnered with Boots and P&G on the #TeenTalk campaign, said television and radio can be a great way for parents to broach potentially awkward topics with their children.  She said: 'A lot of kids now have access to movies and TV shows where issues are brought up. So the issues are much more on their agenda. She continued: 'If you hear something about menstrual troubles on the radio or something, it might be a way to say to your daughter, "what do you think about your period?" or "when do you think you are going to get it?"'  While many parents with children of the same age might find themselves worrying about the dangers of social media, Gabby and Kenny, a former Scotland international player, have lessened the problem by not giving Reuben and Lois mobile phones. Gabby explained: 'I don't want them to become fixated, I don't want it to become the only way that they communicate and I don't want them to post things that are there forever.  'It is very permanent, you have to be very careful about where you go, what you do on the internet... It is about safety.' However she acknowledged there is a very 'practical' side of having a mobile and said there will be a time when they both have one, musing: 'Maybe when they are 13.' Speaking out: Gabby and Lois are partnering with Boots and P&G for the #TeenTalk campaign As part of the #TeenTalk campaign, Boots is offering great offers on the purchase of relevant products such as Venus, Always and Tampax products from the 10th May – 6th June and a free gift with purchase.

The stock, down by a third over the past 12 months, climbed more than 7 per cent in pre-market trading as investors took heart from the improved sales performance. For the fiscal third quarter ending in March, revenue came in at $2.03bn – up 5 per cent compared to year ago period and ahead of the $1.94bn the market had forecast thanks to strong demand for high end perfumes such as Hugo Boss and Calvin Klein. Shares in Coty have come under pressure in recent months as the integration of the beauty business it acquired from Procter & Gamble last year for $12.5bn proved more complicated than expected. While the acquisition has propelled Coty into the world’s third-largest cosmetics seller, the deal came at a time of fierce competition in the mass beauty and personal care industry. Investors have been concerned about whether Coty would have the resources needed to revitalise the 41 brands it took on from P&G as well as invest in its own brands such as Rimmel. “Q3 was a better quarter,” said chief executive Camillo Pane. “This improvement was driven by good growth performance in the Luxury division, flat performance in Professional Beauty, and some improvement but continued negative performance in the Consumer Beauty division.” Warning that 2017 is a transitional year, Mr Pane said “the path to recovery will take some time and will not be a straight line.” Indeed, despite the better than expected top line performance, losses widened at Coty during the first three months of the year as the company continues to book restructuring charges related to the integration of the more than 40 brands it bought from P&G. Net loss attributable to Coty increased to $164.2m, or 22 cents per diluted share, during the quarter, compared to$26.8 million, or 8 cents per share, a year earlier. The bulk of the losses stemmed from the $213.5m of restructuring and acquisition charges it booked during the quarter. Excluding this, Coty earned 15 cents per share, ahead of the 12 cents the market was expecting. Sample the FT’s top stories for a week You select the topic, we deliver the news.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 10 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman How AI is Reinventing the Design of Planes, Trains and Automobiles Deep learning is coming to 3D design. Just ask Dassault Systèmes. The company’s 3DExperience Platform is used for everything from Tesla cars and Boeing airplanes to Procter & Gamble consumer products. Now, it’s amping up 3D design and simulation with deep learning and GPUs. “What people have done with  deep learning for image and speech recognition, we’re doing to transform how products are designed and experienced,” said Patrick Johnson, vice president for corporate research at the 3D modeling software company. AI by Design Traditionally, designers and engineers had to start each new product from scratch. With NVIDIA GPUs and deep learning, Dassault will soon be able to harness the history of previous designs. The system’s 3Dbots use this knowledge to predict and propose a whole new range of designs in a exploratory innovation space. Romain Perron, R&D web apps and services director for Dassault’s flagship CATIA brand, will illustrate those cognitive augmented design 3Dbots in more detail on Thursday at GTC “From there, you just select the ones you want for faster and better design leveraging know-how and past designs,” Johnson said. Engineers can use the company’s software to plan the ideal manufacturing process and see how their design will function in the real world. Shipmaker Meyerwerft used Dassaullt Systemes’ GPU-powered 3D design software to create this ship, which has 300,000 different parts. 3D Design at GTC The company is out in force at the GPU Technology Conference, with three sessions upcoming about how it’s using deep learning, virtual and augmented reality, and NVIDIA Iray rendering software to advance 3D modeling: Enterprise AR: Industry Opportunities and Technology Challenges – Wednesday, May 10, 4:30 p.m., Room 230A Homebyme: How Iray, VCA, Deep Learning and VR Helps You Experience Your New Apartment –  Thursday, May 11, 9 a.m., Room 230C Cognitive Augmented Design with AI-Powered 3DExperience – Thursday, May 11, 11 a.m., Room 230C To learn more about how AI computing is transforming industries, watch for replays of these and other talks from the GPU Technology Conference, May 8-11, in Silicon Valley.

This is the most fascinating aspect of the business of investing. To spot a potential bubble at an early stage in its life cycle and to be able to ride the bull market until the bubble becomes unsustainable and the investment argument translates from truism to fantasy is the most rewarding and exciting part of the cycle of investing. The genesis of any bull market is premised on a logical, credible investment argument followed by a strong surge of liquidity. It is not unreasonable for investors to multiply their capital during the course of a bull market. During the technology bubble, investors across the world had multiplied their wealth 10-500 times in many stocks even as the investment argument moved from revenue growth to clicks on the website. Coming to the current cycle, as the world emerged from the depths of deflation after the global financial crisis on the back of strong steroid of liquidity injected by central banks, the global growth has been feeble, consumers and businesses have been deleveraging and investments have been elusive. In this backdrop, investors have been focusing on good quality companies that can deliver superior growth (in an environment of weak macro growth). In India, these companies have been across various sectors, such as consumer, NBFC, retail banks, building materials and mortgage finance. The strong growth in these businesses has been driven by good quality management, strong execution, subdued competitive intensity and expanding margins due to weak commodity prices. On top of that, all these businesses have witnessed a significant re-rating with P/E multiples expansion due to follow through of huge liquidity. The valuations of the so-called quality companies have expanded exponentially. These companies have delivered multi-fold returns to investors and P/E multiples have expanded to 30-100 times. But after having seen exponential returns in these companies, dark clouds have started emerging over the so-called growth stocks. In case of consumer staples, stock prices have reached a level where they are pricing implied revenue growth of high teens or even higher in most cases, which is clearly not achievable over the course of the life cycle of the business. This is further compounded by the fact that in many categories, such as soaps, shampoo, hair oils, detergents and tooth pastes, the penetration levels have reached a high of 75- 80 per cent and shall constrain future growth. Also, markets are underestimating the future competitive intensity and fragmentation of market share in these categories. Additionally, global growth is picking up and so are commodity prices. This could be a headwind for margins, going forward. Besides, central banks, which have committed one of the largest experiments in the monetary policy by expanding their balance sheets, are reversing course and are withdrawing liquidity and raising interest rates. The rising of rates is one of the biggest gravitational pulls of the P/E ratios of companies with high P/Es. Thus, for an investor holding these stocks till perpetuity, the future returns will be far lower than the historical returns, and for interim owners, their best hope is to find a greater fool. The US had a similar bubble in good quality companies in the late 60s called the famous “Nifty Fifty Bubble”. In the late 1960s when the economic growth was sluggish, many good companies delivered relatively high growth and their P/Es expanded exponentially. Because these companies were excellent businesses delivering solid growth, they were deemed as impregnable fortress and included the most famous blue chips like Kodak, Procter & Gamble, 3M, IBM, Johnson & Johnson, Xerox etc. By 1972, when the S&P 500 Index’s P/E stood at a then lofty 19, the Nifty Fifty’s average P/E was more than twice of that, at 42. Among the most inflated stocks were Polaroid with a P/E of 91; McDonald’s, 86; Walt Disney, 82; and Avon Products, 65. The sharp rise in oil prices due to the OPEC oil embargo led to a significant rise in inflation and consequently interest rates, pricking the Nifty Fifty Bubble. The Nifty Fifty companies lost significant value and it took investors decades to recover their capital in them from their respective highs. For instance, Xerox fell 71 per cent, Avon 86 per cent and Polaroid 91 per cent, and some of them even ceased to exist (like Kodak, Xerox) because over a period, technology made their businesses obsolete. Thus, it’s important to distinguish between great businesses and great stocks. It is the inherent nature of markets to create bubbles and burst them. Markets are like a pendulum that keeps swinging from one extreme to another, from deep value to bubble and do not stop at the centre (point of fair value). Chuck Prince, the erstwhile CEO of Citi, at the peak of the mortgage bubble exclaimed that “we should keep dancing until the music is on”. Well, this approach could provide a lot of excitement but could be fatal for the health of value investors. Prudent long-term investors need to escape the dance floor preemptively even if it means missing out on some potential returns. It is important for long-term value investors to stay focused on the intrinsic value of businesses rather than chase momentum.

Already with 1,600 U.S. stores, Aldi has set a minimum target of selling groceries at a 21 percent discount to its U.S. rivals, including Wal-Mart Stores Inc , Chief Executive Jason Hart told Reuters. His strategy, previously unreported, centers on adding more private-label goods, which are a retailer's in-house brands, to win over price-sensitive customers, and a massive expansion to further disrupt a U.S. grocery sector that has seen 18 companies go bankrupt since 2014. Hart's plan calls for spending US$1.6 billion to expand and remodel 1,300 U.S. stores, and open 400 new stores mainly in Florida, Texas and on both coasts by end of 2018. He also pledged Aldi will be willing to change prices more frequently to respond to rivals if needed. "We are re-merchandising, remodeling, enhancing our product range and are focused on gaining volume so more customers start their shopping at Aldi and we are able to complete their shopping lists moreso than we have in the past," said Hart, who added Aldi's U.S. sales have doubled in five years. Advertisement Advertisement Though it only accounts for only about 1.5 percent of the U.S. grocery market, Aldi is growing at 15 percent a year, whereas Wal-Mart currently controls about 22 percent of the market and its U.S. sales are estimated to grow about 2 percent this year, according to analysts. Aldi's growth potential has competitors taking notice. Reuters reported in February that Wal-Mart is running price tests in 11 states, pushing vendors to undercut Aldi and other rivals by 15 percent and is expected to spend about US$6 billion to regain its title as the low-price leader. For a graphic, click http://tmsnrt.rs/2le6v0Y Price wars are roiling the entire retail sector - from department stores to discount chains - but it is nowhere as intense as in the grocery sector. Beyond Wal-Mart's move to match Aldi on price, German discount chain Lidl plans to open up to a 100 U.S. stores in a year, and Amazon.com Inc is aggressively testing out various brick-and-mortar grocery formats along with growing Amazon Fresh, its grocery delivery service. For a graphic, click http://tmsnrt.rs/2qRbNT9 "We have not seen anything like this in the grocery sector in the United States before," said Scott Mushkin, managing director of Wolfe Research and a leading pricing analyst. Such heated competition risks a dangerous race to the bottom that could result in more retailers shutting their doors. "Given Aldi's expansion, Lidl's entry, Wal-Mart's response and Amazon's growing ambitions in this space, it is fair to expect a significant acceleration in the bankruptcy and liquidation cycle in this sector over the next few years," said Burt Flickinger, managing director at retail consultancy Strategic Resource Group. For more on Wal-Mart's stock performance vs Amazon, click GOAL: EVERYDAY LOW PRICING Aldi, has a simple strategy to win more customers: everyday low pricing, according to Hart. "We don't confuse our customers with yo-yo discounts, sales, coupons and loyalty cards that require membership fees," he said. Four analysts and consultants contacted by Reuters confirmed Aldi now offers the lowest prices in private label consumer products in the states it operates, although they did say Wal-Mart is gaining ground in the states they are conducting price tests. Hart said Aldi's internal studies show its prices are 21 percent lower than its lowest-priced rivals and the discount retailer intends to keep the advantage at least that strong going forward. Depending on the product, Aldi's prices are cheaper than most rivals' private label items and even most branded items, analysts said. Hart said the 21 percent difference in price is calculated by monitoring competition on a basket of groceries. Aldi counts on its no-frills shopping experience to help keep costs low, and limits much of its inventory to items that sell in huge volume. But its focus on offering far more private label items than branded products is central to allowing Aldi to adjust pricing whenever it chooses, Hart said. Aldi and Wal-Mart do no break out the figures, but analysts including Mushkin and Flickinger say Aldi carries about 1,200 stock keeping units (SKUs) or type of products, 90 percent of which are private label. Wal-Mart stocks about 30,000-40,000 SKU's of products similar to ones Aldi sells, and only 30 percent of that are private labels. That different product mix can potentially make it more difficult for Wal-Mart to adjust prices because it often first needs buy-in from suppliers, and many times faces push back from packaged goods makers like Procter & Gamble , Unilever and even smaller brands. Such vendors fear steep discounting can erode the value of their brands, analysts said. A Wal-Mart spokesman declined comment saying the company would not comment on a competitor's strategy. P&G and Unilever did not respond to Reuters requests seeking comment. But the explosive growth in private label products is on the radar of Wal-Mart Chief Executive Doug McMillon. Last month he told analysts that private label goods will play an even more important role as the widespread availability of branded products online will compress those products margins over time. "Aldi is disrupting the sector the way Wal-Mart did when they started," said Strategic Resource Group's Flickinger. STEPPING UP THE GAME Aldi's aggressive push to remodel its stores will allow it to add new private label merchandise in rapidly growing categories like fresh food. "The remodels are aimed at increasing our volumes which means more purchasing power that will help us lower prices further," said Scott Patton, Aldi's vice president of corporate buying. At a recent visit to an Aldi store in Wheaton, Illinois Reuters found newer-looking shelves, wider aisles and brighter lighting than a typical Aldi store. There was also a bigger assortment of fresh, organic, gluten-free products and antibiotic-free meats versus what it stocked earlier - categories Aldi said is growing the most rapidly at its stores. For example, its Simply Nature range of private-label products grew 53 percent to US$300 million in 2016 from a year ago. Aldi has also opened stores close to Wal-Mart's supercenters to benefit from its budget-conscious shoppers. Its total store count of 2,000 stores by the end of next year will be about 42 percent of Wal-Mart's U.S. store base.

ADD TO PORTFOLIO ADD TO WATCHLIST SHARE YOUR OULOOK ChartsValuation & Peer ComparisonCommunity Buzz PEER COMPANIES Dabur India EXPAND TO VIEW ALL Mumbai: Bolstered by predictions of a normal monsoon by the India Meteorological Department, stocks of consumer companies like Hindustan Unilever, Emami closed between 2% and 4.6% higher on Wednesday, while the BSE FMCG index rose 1.81%. Analysts said though consumer companies with a broad rural focus will benefit from increased rural spending power given a healthy monsoon, valuations of these companies do not offer comfort. Traders, however, expect the bullishness in FMCG stocks to continue. ET spoke to analysts on the outlook on shares of top consumer companies, whose prospects are partly linked to monsoon. Hindustan Unilever CMP: Rs 995.90 Year to Date returns: 20.57% *Price to Earnings: 50.28 *Buys-21, Sells-6 , Holds-17 Despite an expected expansion in market share with the onset of GST along with higher sales from a good monsoon, analysts said the stock’s valuations offer no comfort. “The current valuations at 45 times 2017 earnings are too high. Earnings and profi t growth hardly match up to valuations even after taking into account increased sales from a good monsoon,” said Sachin Bobade, analyst at Dolat Capital. Traders, however, said the stock has seen a 5% open interest addition and is expected to go to Rs 1044 in the coming days. Dabur India CMP: Rs 282.20 Year to Date returns: 1.78% *Price to Earnings: 34.43 *Buys-15 , Sells-8 , Holds-16 Analysts said the stock would fare better than urban peers like P&G Hygiene and Health Care and Nestle. “Dabur’s rural sales will see more traction from another normal monsoon and volumes will be higher as compared to more urban consumptiondriven names like Nestle,” said Abneesh Roy, senior vice-president of institutional equities at Edelweiss Securities. Ashu Bagri, assistant vice president-technical research at SBICap Securities, said the stock has just started a decisive upward movement. Marico CMP: Rs 315.50 Year to Date returns: 21.06% *Price to Earnings: 43.60 *Buys-10, Sells-13 , Holds-21 Analysts said improved demand in the hair oil segment will help increase sales growth in the coming months. They, however, said it would be diffi cult to sustain the current valuations of 48 times 2017 earnings as increased spend on advertisements for new launches will put some pressure on margins. The stock has seen addition of long positions said Chandan Taparia, derivative & technical analyst at Motilal Oswal Securities. He said the stock would rise to Rs 325 in coming days. Emami CMP: Rs 1,099.35 Year to Date returns: 15.01% *Price to Earnings: 37.87 *Buys-24 , Sells-6, Holds-4 The company is looking at increasing direct reach of its products by reducing wholesale contribution to 42% from 52%. Analysts said this shift, combined with the GST-led pressure on margins would have an impact on the stock which is trading at 65 times its 2017 earnings. “The stock has underperformed in the last few quarters while its new hair oil product has not yet taken off, so we would wait to see how it pans out,” said Roy of Edelweiss. Traders said the stock would rise to Rs 1180 in the weeks ahead.

EVERETT — Snohomish County planners have said —for a second time — that a controversial housing development can move ahead next to a dormant landfill, if it adheres to specific conditions. Planners in 2014 granted initial approval to the Bakerview subdivision, only to have the project sent back the following year for more study. Among concerns raised by neighbors were plans to address the former Go-East landfill, which shares the 40-acre site on the 4300 block of 108th Street SE, outside of Everett. They appealed to the county hearing examiner, who agreed on key points. The 97 proposed homes would go up next to the old landfill, not on top of it. In the early 1980s, underground fires smoldered at the dump for years. Operations ceased in 1983. P&G East LLC, of Kirkland, is seeking to build the project. The latest plans alter the homes’ layout and offer a more detailed proposal for formally closing the landfill. The county issued a mitigated determination of nonsignificance for those plans Sunday. The deadline to file appeals with the hearing examiner is May 22.   Most Read Police: Incidents of gunfire in Everett may be gang related EVERETT — A south Everett apartment complex has become a frequent stop… May 9th, 2017 by Caitlin Tompkins Everett elementary PTA says $15,000 missing from coffers EVERETT — Hawthorne Elementary serves students in one of Everett’s poorest neighborhoods.… May 10th, 2017 by Rikki King City of Everett, YMCA mull partnership on new pool EVERETT — In a couple years, Everett might have a second publicly… May 9th, 2017 by Chris Winters Port of Everett to vote on lease of waterfront mill site EVERETT — Private development projects in the early stages could bring hundreds… May 9th, 2017 by Dan Catchpole Lynnwood man sentenced for vehicular homicide EVERETT — A Lynnwood man, in trouble with the law on and… May 9th, 2017 by Scott North © 2017, Everett Herald and Sound Publishing, Inc.

President Donald Trump is pursuing a pro-growth agenda and if the tax and deregulation policies that he has articulated come to pass, the economy could accelerate. If that happens, employees who were once content to hang on to what they had in an economy growing at less than 2 per cent a year could see opportunity knocking. Now is the time, therefore, to begin thinking about how to keep the employees you want to retain from leaving for what they might suddenly see as greener pastures. Outlook improving The evidence that positive economic change may be coming, or at least may be expected, is starting to mount. Unemployment is relatively low at 4.8 per cent and with a modest upturn of investment in inventories, plants and other fixed assets, competition for new talent is ramping up. Year-over-year earnings growth for the fourth quarter of 2016 tracked at about 7.5 per cent, according to Thomson Reuters, with revenues up 5 per cent from the year-ago period. Expect those trends to continue if Trumps much expected economic policies succeed in accelerating growth. It is what Wall Street is betting on. The multiplier effect New jobs, of course, have a multiplier effect on local economies. Enrico Moretti, a professor of economics at the University of California, Berkeley, says that for each new high-tech job in a city such as Austin, Seattle or Boston, five additional jobs are ultimately created in the region, both skilled (lawyers, teachers, nurses) and so-called unskilled (waiters, hairdressers, carpenters). Most sectors have a multiplier effect, but innovation, Moretti adds, has a disproportionate effect on the economy of American communities, the largest multiplier of all, about three times that of manufacturing. Changing workforce demographics So youre hiring again. Thats great, but what are you doing to keep valued employees from leaving? Retention is something management consultants and other experts say is now more important than ever. The United States Bureau of Labour Statistics projects that within five years, half the workforce will be made up of millennials and Gen Z-ers, people who likely will not spend more than two years in the same job, as they get lured away by hot new start-ups, opt for the Gig Economy or look for a major new assignment within their same organisation. We have long since moved on from the days when eager recruits dreamt of spending their entire careers at one place. A growing economy also means rising attrition rates, as employees leave for jobs they believe will engage them more and offer better growth opportunities. It is a sellers market, driven by both practical and emotional factors. The term revolving door is no longer the pejorative it once was, for the employer and the employee alike. In fact, if your departing employees go on to pastures that are recognised to be greener, it can be a silver lining for you, as your reputation may increase. As The Week put it recently in an article covering a study of law-firm hiring practices, The Upside of Losing Your Best People, you may become known as a talent magnet that can attract younger talent at lower wages. Real or perceived shortcomings in compensation, benefits and the degree to which their work is respected and acknowledged by managers thus become key elements in the decisions that key employees make as to whether to stay or go. A recent Deloitte Human Capital Trends Report showed that 78 per cent of business leaders list employee engagement and retention as one of their top priorities. It is a consequential bottom-line issue: factoring in recruitment fees, training and lost productivity, studies have shown that the cost of losing an employee is equal to 20 per cent of their annual salary, more if the person makes more than $50,000 a year. Retaining the best Do you worry your top talent will walk out the door? How do you keep that from happening? McKinsey has long believed that too many companies simply throw money at executives and top performers during periods of organisational change  mergers, for example  or as a defensive move to deflect a competitor who starts picking off the low-hanging fruit of high-profile rainmakers; think investment banks or law firms that go on recruiting binges. Such money, McKinsey believes, is rarely well spent, since many of the recipients would have stayed anyway, and others have concerns that would not be solved simply by a bigger paycheque. Yes, draw up a list of all key players. But target only those who are most critical to the mission and are at the highest risk of leaving. Often this filtered list, which could involve as little as 10 per cent of all employees, includes some hidden gems who are average performers or may be nearing retirement, but are critically important to day-to-day operations and to delivering against longer-term business objectives. These people often have unexceptional performance records, but can have important institutional knowledge, direct relationships with key suppliers or customers, or valuable technical skills that make the trains run on time. No, these employees do not typically show up on an HR high potential list, but they are important nonetheless. In one merger it worked on, McKinsey found several sales support staffers who did basic tasks such as filling orders and taking inventory, but they turned out to be just as important to the companys success as the star salespeople. Who is at risk Research abounds, measuring all aspects of employee retention  a process that colours every aspect of the work experience. The process starts at the job interview, and continues through tangible elements such as training, mentoring and performance evaluations, to intangibles such as company culture and live-work policies. Explaining what all these studies mean has led to the development of a flourishing industry of workplace consultants. For example, TINYpulse, which offers solutions to employee engagement problems, recently pointed to studies from Accenture, LinkedIn, Gallup and other sources for the top reasons that employees leave jobs:  Their responsibilities do not match their job description Thirty-eight per cent have left companies because they felt that their responsibilities were out of line with their job descriptions and their salaries.  Their work isnt interesting, or they dont see its importance to the organisation or they dont see where it leads for them Thirty-eight per cent said they have left jobs because they found the work to be mind-numbingly boring. Almost 30 per cent left because they didnt feel their work made a positive impact in their organisation. And a lack of opportunity for advancement is the third most common reason why people leave their companies.  They burn out from working long and inflexible hours Thirty-one per cent have left jobs because they were expected to log long hours regularly  and those hours had to be worked during specific times from specific locations.  They do not receive feedback or recognition from their bosses Thirty-three per cent have moved on because their supervisors never gave them feedback to help them to develop their skills or did not take enough proactive steps to recognise a job well done. All these reasons can be addressed. As can additional ones such as lack of connection with co-workers and poor fit with the company culture and the whopper, with 50 per cent citing it in one study  not getting along with the boss. If all of the above sounds like keen-grasp-of-the-obvious, you would be correct. But these conclusions also underscore how the most basic things often matter most; learning what is important to the individual employee is critical. In situations where valued workers are being asked to relocate overseas, for example, is assistance being offered in finding and paying for schools for the children, career counselling for the spouses, language training and alterative work arrangements such as telecommuting? Defining high-potential employees Opportunities for leadership development are often a powerful incentive in any retention programme. For example, in a merger aimed at building up a North American pharmaceutical companys presence in Europe, 50 valued middle managers from the acquired company accepted invitations to join transatlantic teams. Their responsibilities included playing key roles in integrating the two companies and developing new strategies. Not only did the acquiring companys top people get a close-up look at a new talent pool for future development, but the participants also got a clear motivational signal that they had a future in the merged operation, along with a chance to interact with the acquirers top management. But as the Harvard Business Review has warned, launching programmes aimed at developing high potential employees can be fraught with peril, notwithstanding the success companies like GE, PepsiCo, Unilever and Shell have had in managing talent. For one thing, top executives need to weigh the benefits of putting high performers into development programmes that distract them from their immediate responsibilities. For another, those who are not picked for such programmes  ie, the clear majority of managers  are invariably demoralised and start talking to headhunters. And too often, the Harvard Business Review noted, the programmes fail to maintain momentum, leaving companies unsure they have paid off and fuelling worker cynicism. Theres no one-size-fits-all solution here, no off-the-shelf version that can be applied everywhere. The development programme must be tied directly to the corporations overall strategy. A company trying to aggressively expand by acquiring emerging market firms, for example, needs a very different programme from one for a firm that is pursuing low-cost leadership through operational and productivity improvements, HBR noted. Often, the Harvard researchers found, companies they surveyed had launched high-potential programmes without clearly establishing what they meant by potential. Such initiatives are bound to fail. The Harvard Business School definition of potential is a persons ability to grow and to handle responsibilities of greater scale and scope. Those considered to be high potentials see themselves as change agents who derive insight from a vast range of information by applying transformative new ideas; they engage with others and demonstrate resolve; they seek understanding by constantly exposing themselves to new ideas and experiences; they seek to make a positive impact on others for the good of the entire organisation; and they have a passion for team-building and making things happen. Rethinking the career track Internal programmes that identify such people and nurture them accomplish two things: identification of the companys most promising future leaders, and locking them in emotionally and professionally to the corporate mission, thereby creating a natural barrier to defection. One way to energise those who may feel a lack of growth because of a perceived clogged management pipeline is to rethink the basics of the classic career track. Take away the traditional ladder and replace it with a matrix of different challenges and opportunities to stimulate problem-solving in different environments. Removing the traditional ladder also energises those technical employees, such as many Stem types, who feel no need to advance to management or leadership positions. Such employees can be very loyal if they feel that they are truly developing and using their skills in service to the corporate mission; promotions and new titles are not necessarily motivating forces. Re-recruit your most promising people for these assignments. Job rotation such as this has become a science at places like GE, Cargill and P&G, corporations that stretch personnel and stimulate problem-solving in bigger-scale, bigger-scope positions  often in different locations that bring novelty and the need to adapt. But again, the Harvard researchers issue a warning: dont overload people. There is a fine line between a challenging assignment and an overwhelming one. Benefits, perks and corporate culture A must have element of any retention programme, of course, is a competitive benefits package, profit sharing and medical provisions that give employees an incentive to stay. These programmes can be early casualties of cost-cutting when times are tough, so this may be the year to revisit them. Generous benefit programmes are always high on the list of reasons employees stick around. Consider adding perks that do not cost a lot but acknowledge that employees have lives outside of work: flexible hours, telecommuting options, a generous vacation policy, catered sandwiches or pizza for those who must work late, and a car service home on those nights. Simple things that may seem obvious but build loyalty. A culture that seems to be constantly about work is off-putting. Chris Evans, founder of The Purposeful Culture Group, says: If leaders model 80-hour weeks and they respond to e-mails at 1am, those norms trickle down to employees ... If leaders model taking their vacation time  all four weeks every year  that can trickle down, inspiring managers to take their vacations and to encourage their employees to take theirs. Communicating commitment Central to implementing an enhanced retention programme is a parallel internal communications plan, focused on highlighting and reinforcing the companys commitment to employee wellbeing. Elements should include regular newsletters, and town meetings to update everyone on broad corporate developments and goals. Most importantly, the core factor of internal communication should be direct engagement with individual employees, including a substantive annual review process, where they get feedback from management, including candid, constructive criticism. But this should not be limited to only once a year. It should be a constant process, with supervisors and senior management showing respect and appreciation for an individuals performance. Employee engagement expert Kevin Sheridan says: Regularly thank people for their work. Admit when you make a mistake. Apologise. The absence of this kind of communication and interaction puts valued employees out in the desert with no water. Dont let that happen to your company. Otherwise, you will be spending more time than you wanted filling new openings. In a larger context Finally, we live and work in highly charged times. Developing situations at Fox News and in several Silicon Valley companies have thrown the issue of sexual harassment, which is not a new factor in the workplace, under a new spotlight. For the women involved, there is no doubt that harassment, and their reaction to it, has affected their retention as employees. The New York Times editorialised recently about the entrenched reality of practices that have discounted, demeaned and derailed womens work lives for decades. Those practices include not only sexual harassment, but also persistent disparities in pay and promotion, as well as structural impediments  in childcare, scheduling and other workplace policies. Those barriers to women are no secret. Their injustice is obvious. This entrenched reality applies to other employee populations, across all industries and professions, as well. The most carefully calibrated retention practices can be useless in the face of broader injustices faced also by ... men and women balancing family life in all its permutations ... by men and women facing illness ... by people in minimum-wage jobs ... by men and women who are differently abled ... by LGBTQ men and women ... by men and women of colour ... by people belonging to any minority group ... and more as the diversity of our culture, and therefore our workplaces, increases.  The Dilenschneider Group, which has offices in New York, Washington and Chicago, provides access for clients to the finest and most seasoned communications professionals in the world, with experience in fields ranging from mergers and acquisitions and crisis communications to marketing, government affairs and international media Make text smaller Make text larger Comments You must be registered or signed-in to post comment or to vote.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo Beauty products maker Coty Inc (COTY.N) reported higher-than-expected quarterly profit and sales, helped by strong demand for labels such as Calvin Klein as well as for recently acquired brands ghd and Younique. Coty's shares rose as much as 15 percent to a near 6-month high of $20.50 on Wednesday. They eased to trade up 13 percent, set for their best one-day percentage gain since February 2016. The company has inked multiple deals in the past year to gain market share amid stiff competition and reduce its dependence on its perfume business, that was once struggling. In the past year Coty has bought more than 40 brands from Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N), the personal care and beauty business of Brazil's Hypermarcas SA (HYPE3.SA), a majority stake in online cosmetics retailer Younique and also a high-end hair styling appliance brand, ghd. Coty said its third-quarter revenue rose 6 percent to $2.03 billion on a constant currency basis and after adjusting year-ago sales for the P&G acquisition. That beat analysts average estimate of $1.94 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Excluding acquisitions, sales declined 2 percent in constant currency. Coty, however, expects current-quarter net revenue, excluding ghd and Younique, to be lower than the third quarter, which Chief Executive Camillo Pane blamed on lost shelf space at retailers for certain P&G brands. Pane told Reuters the lost space will continue to hit results for a few more quarters, until marketing efforts on brands such as Covergirl, Max Factor and Clairol, which were "orphaned" at P&G, pays off. Pane said Brazil was a bright spot in the third quarter, despite a recession, with sales rising in the double-digit percentage range as Coty sold more nail polishes and hair products that are affordable and recession-proof. Coty's consumer beauty business saw sales increase 5 percent, reflecting strong contributions from Younique and one month of sales from the Brazil Hypermarcas deal. The business accounted for nearly half of total sales. Sales in Coty's luxury business, which sells high-end perfumes such as Calvin Klein and Hugo Boss, rose 2 percent.

Reuters/Jim Urquhart An increasing number of gay Australians are heading to New Zealand to tie the knot. Economists note that it is the Down Under’s loss, since the economy is missing out on the business that will be generated by same-sex weddings. In a 2015 report, ANZ Bank estimated that gay marriage can contribute $550 million to the economy within one year of legislation. Fifty eight percent of weddings held in New Zealand last year involved same-sex couples from Australia. Cherelle Murphy, co-author of the report and senior economist at ANZ, said the country may also miss out on wedding-related consumption to overseas destinations. Several major economies such as the United States, the United Kingdom, France and Canada have legalised the gay unions. New Zealand has seen more than 3,000 same-sex couples getting married since marriage equality was enshrined in law. In Australia, major parties are yet to reach agreement on how to vote on the issue. Labor Party shows strong support while Conservative MPs urges Aussie Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull to defy a free vote in Parliament. Murphy explained that the loss was not just about the wedding itself, but also with the additional services that they generate, Sydney Morning Herald reports. Examples of these are divorce lawyers and honeymoon travel. According to Quartz Media, support for marriage equality stands at a record two-thirds of the Australian population. Tiernan Brady, the director of the Equality Campaign in Australia, puts the blame on politics, saying it is failing to reflect the values of the Australian people. Alex Greenwich, co-chair of Australians for Marriage Equality, said their campaign was growing stronger than ever. “We’re in new territory on this journey and politicians can no longer avoid the momentum,” Greenwich said. Australia companies, including Qantas and Commonwealth Bank of Australia, agree that marriage equality makes good business sense. “Equality and diversity are strategic business issues,” the companies said in a letter to the prime minister. Even global companies have expressed their support for marriage equality in Australia. These include Procter & Gamble, GE, Google, eBay and American Express. Airbnb started a campaign which it called “Until we all belong.” It urges people who support marriage equality to wear an incomplete ring that symbolises the “gap in marriage equality that we need to close.”  In a statement, CEO Brian Chesky said he hoped the initiative would make marriage equality a priority in the country’s political agenda.

Skeptics, however, warn that touting such an approach is premature because scientists are still working to understand the bacteria that live on our skin and interact with it. The cover story in Chemical & Engineering News (C&EN), the weekly newsmagazine of the American Chemical Society, scopes out the scene. Marc S. Reisch, a senior correspondent at C&EN, reports that cosmetic firms, large and small, are increasingly interested in how the microbiome affects skin health. To see if they can bottle some of its potential benefits, they're researching skin bacteria and active ingredients to promote helpful microbes and discourage harmful ones. However, skeptics caution that scientists don't yet have a baseline picture of what a healthy skin microbiome would look like, much less know how to achieve a healthy bacterial community. Undeterred by the limited body of skin microbiome knowledge, at least a couple of companies have already marketed bacteria-based product lines. Yun Probiotherapy says its line incorporates "friendly" bacteria to help correct skin microbe imbalances. AOBiome based its product on results from a study examining why horses roll in the dirt. They found that bacteria in the dirt produce compounds that help regulate inflammation and that could be beneficial to skin. Cosmetic heavyweights, including Johnson & Johnson, Procter & Gamble and L'Oréal, are also developing microbiome-based products.

This new service offers the traditional subscription-only option and an additional flexible on-demand purchase option – with an industry-first re-order process that is as simple as sending a one-word text message1. The creation of this new service and its features is fueled by the understanding that accessibility, shopping experience, and value are every bit as important to men as quality and product innovation. Extensive research with Gillette’s own shave club customers and among men broadly uncovered clear opportunities to improve the subscription-only approach: more flexible purchase options, easier ways to order, and enhanced value for Gillette’s high quality blades. A 2015 Nielsen Homescan study for example found that 41% of guys who decided to leave traditional shave clubs said they were getting more blades than they needed. That frustration is a thing of the past thanks to Gillette® On Demand™’s industry-first as-needed ordering option. “Ordering blades has never been easier than we’re making it today,” said Mark Jeffreys, Brand Director, Gillette. “Gillette® On Demand™’s as-needed ordering capabilities and its convenient subscription options give guys smart choices, not trade-offs. This new service puts them in control without having to choose between convenience and flexibility, or between great quality and value.” Knowing how important value is to men, the service will include a range of razor options at different price points so men can enjoy the high-quality shave they deserve at a price they’ll be pleasantly surprised by. Guys who choose to subscribe will benefit from the added value of receiving every 4th order free2 and all first-time customers will enjoy $3 off their first order. Shave club customers also like simplicity and convenience. With Gillette® On Demand™, guys have the added option to order only the blades they want, when and where they want them. With just a one-word text message (send BLADES to 252-337/BLADES1), On Demand customers will be able to trigger their next shipment – no back and forth with customer service, no entering of shipping or payment information. Making Changes Guided by Guys People appreciate options in life, and Gillette turned to men themselves to determine just which options matter most when they shop online. The company’s research led directly to the features and benefits of the new Gillette® On Demand™: Flexibility: Having a choice between buying as-needed or scheduled deliveries gives men the flexibility that many of them have asked for. Ease of Ordering: The new Gillette® On Demand™ service lets guys quickly order and reorder blades on-demand using a new website, by email or with a one-word text message. This industry-first SMS reorder service allows guys registered for as-needed shipments to trigger their next delivery by texting “BLADES” to BLADES (252-337)1. It’s that simple. Customization: For subscription orders, customers have the flexibility to fully customize a delivery schedule that meets their unique grooming style. Guys can opt to auto-set a delivery that arrives at any cadence they choose – and it can be changed or canceled at any time. From Gillette’s Factory to Guys’ Bathrooms Gillette® On Demand™ marks the company’s first direct-to-consumer service, delivering the company’s highest quality blades straight from Gillette facilities to men’s doorsteps in about 2-3 business days. But what makes a blade “the best” varies from guy to guy – that’s why Gillette On Demand makes a wide range of products available at price points men will be pleasantly surprised by. Fusion® ProShield® – 4 cartridges for $18.45 (for first order including handle; $21.45 on subsequent orders) plus free shipping MACH3® Turbo – 5 cartridges for $10 (for first order including handle; $13 on subsequent orders) plus free shipping Sensor® 3 – 8 disposable razors for $8 (for first order; $11 on subsequent orders) plus $2 shipping For first-time subscription customers taking advantage of both the $3 off and the 4th order free2 offers, these prices just get better. A first time customer receiving quarterly deliveries of MACH3® Turbo blades will save $16 within his first 4 orders of Gillette® On Demand™ (vs. 4 as-needed orders) and pay an average of $1.80 per razor cartridge.
