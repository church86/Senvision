The shift to digital marketing comes with a lack of reliable outcomes making it harder to forecast sales — bad news for pre-IPO startups and public companies By Tom Foremski for Tom Foremski: IMHO | May 19, 2017 -- 00:04 GMT (17:04 PDT) | Topic: Start-Ups Wall Street hates missed estimates. Photographer: Maciej Bledowski, Getty Images/iStockphoto The lesson for startups from Snap's recent share fall when it reported huge losses was not the lack of profitability -- it was that it missed analyst estimates despite a big jump in marketing spend. The seemingly unstoppable demise of the media industry has forced many companies to be media companies as they try to reach potential customers with their marketing through traditional and social media channels, and across multiple devices. In this fractured media world the old marketing programs don't work the same way while the new marketing programs might not work the same way the next time you try them. When I met Microsoft CMO Grad Conn earlier this year, he told me that everything he knew about marketing he had to re-learn and this is coming from a former Procter & Gamble marketing executive -- P&G marketing is almost a science. Google revamps ads to prioritize mobile, focus on local searches More than 50% of Google search queries now come from mobile devices, while location-related mobile searches are growing 50% faster than all mobile searches. Read More Traditional marketing such as advertising, TV, web seminars, trade shows, etc is less effective because potential customers are spending their time with many other types of media: social, games, Instagram, Twitter, forums, etc. It's a many-media world and company marketing campaigns are getting used to the fact that each type of media has to be approached in its own way which adds complexity. The fickle nature of online trends means that marketing needs to be vigilant and responsive on a near real-time basis. Microsoft employs more than 150 social media product managers for such tasks. ""You have to be constantly learning," says Conn. Constantly learning because things are constantly changing. Most CMOs would rather manage a process rather than be engaged in the process through leadership by example, Conn is an exception. This constant change in online trends means that the results of marketing programs cannot be used to a reliably forecast sales. With traditional marketing programs for example: P&G knows what each $1m spent in TV ads will generate in product sales. But what will $1m in marketing across a many-media landscape generate? Is it better to spend it on podcast sponsorships or maybe public relations? Foggy marketing... It's a fog as Sean Maloney, Intel's former CMO once told me when he spoke about the new types of challenges thrown up by this many-media landscape which because of Intel's global reach he had to figure out country by country. Intel currently has a marketing budget of over $2 billion showing the scale of this problem. When the marketing gets tough the tough get going: CMO job tenure continues to fall (3.5 years compared with CEOs 7.2 years). It's the toughest job in the C-suite. For IPO: Predictability trumps profitability... Predictability in revenues is the biggest challenge to tech IPOs -- not profitability as Snap found to its cost. All pre-IPO companies face the same scaling challenge: they have to demonstrate how invested capital equals predictable growth. Young tech companies know that revenues are lumpy and have tried to do away with estimates. When Google went public it said it would not issue any financial guidance -- but that didn't work. Pre-IPO statements such as Snap's warning about the difficulty in forecasting revenues didn't work either -- investors have their own risk assessment based on many factors. If companies don't offer guidance the consensus estimates could be way out of line and so would its effect on the share price. Missed estimates... Large companies face the same problems. A few recent headlines: IBM posts first revenue miss in five quarters, shares tumble Sramana Mitra Blog | SAP Continues to Soar, Despite Earnings Miss Johnson & Johnson misses estimates after $17B in revenue. Intel, Microsoft miss estimates, but growth businesses remain strong Cisco revenue forecast disappoints; says to cut 1,100 more jobs | Reuters Will AT&T Inc. (T) Stock Be Derailed By Its Earnings Fallout? | InvestorPlace Apple lower on revenues miss Twillio and other tech companies revise estimates Procter & Gamble sales disappoint... It is not fair to blame marketing unpredictability for making every company's financial estimates unreliable -- but it certainly does nothing to help improve accuracy. Online ads continue to fail in effectiveness and performance metrics are proliferating and confusing. In such an environment it is not surprising that marketing costs are rising says Gartner. As digital marketing spend overtakes traditional channels we should see: a rise in the number of missed financial estimates across all companies; stock volatility during earnings season will be more common; and the tech IPO pipeline will continue to struggle with successful launches. And there is no easy solution (tracking is not selling).

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Better Buy: Procter & Gamble Company vs. Coca-Cola This edition of our better buy series takes a look at two of the biggest consumer giants in the world. Jeremy Bowman (TMFHobo) May 18, 2017 at 12:00PM Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) and Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) are two of the most revered companies in the U.S. Each is more than a century old, and they are the global leaders in their respective categories -- P&G in household products, and Coke in beverages. Each has a portfolio of brands that are known around the world. Among P&G's more prominent names are Gillette, Tide, Crest, and Pampers, while Coca-Cola has Sprite, Fanta, and Minute Maid in addition to its namesake family of Coke drinks. Image source: Procter & Gamble. As stocks, the two have several similarities also. Both are Dividend Aristocrats and solid dividend payers, and the two stocks behave as defensive consumer staples as investors tend to seek shelter in them during weak markets. But they have both underperformed the recent bull market, as the chart below shows. PG data by YCharts As you can see, both stocks have significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the past five years. Still, market conditions can change sooner than you think. Let's take a closer look at each these stocks to see which one is the better buy today. The whole drugstore and then some Procter & Gamble's products may be in more homes than any other company in the world. The company has built a global empire by establishing leading positions across a wide range of household goods, including paper products, diapers, detergent, razors, toothpaste, deodorant, and dish soap. P&G has 21 billion-dollar brands and another 11 with more than $500 million in annual sales. There's no doubting the strength of the company's brands, but recent growth has been more wanting. The company has been in the process of selling off non-core brands such as Cover Girl and 40 other beauty brands to Coty and Duracell to Berkshire Hathaway in an attempt to focus on core assets. However, that strategy has delivered mixed results. In its most recent quarter, organic sales increased just 1%, though cost-cutting led to currency-neutral core EPS growth of 15%. Organic sales in the company's grooming segment fell 6% as the company continues to face pressure from subscription services like Dollar Shave Club, now owned by rival Unilever (NYSE:UL), and Harry's. Still, for the full year the company sees just mid-single-digit growth in core EPS. While P&G has been focused on cost-cutting, it seems to be losing to rival Unilever, which has been more focused on growth and acquisitions, even earning takeover interest from Kraft Heinz Company.  Image source: Coca-Cola. Taste the feeling Coke's recent results bear a strong resemblance to Procter & Gamble's, as sales growth has been difficult to come by but earnings have been boosted by cost-cutting and share buybacks. In the company's most recent quarter, organic revenues were flat, though that included two fewer days in the quarter and the loss of the Easter holiday. Adjusted earnings per share fell from $0.45 to $0.43, and management expects adjusted EPS to fall 1-3% for the full year. Coke is currently undergoing a transformation plan, which involves a number of initiatives that should determine the company's growth over the next few years. Among those initiatives are uniting its trademark Coke brands as part of its "One Brand" marketing campaign, designed to extend the halo of Coca-Cola to its other trademarks. That also includes using smaller bottles, which have done well, for portion control. Coke will also focus on growth in emerging markets more and refranchise bottling operations.  In recent years, Coca-Cola has made efforts to diversify away from its core business, making investments in Keurig Green Mountain, which was later bought out, and Monster Beverage. The company also continues to acquire smaller brands such Ades, a Latin American soy-based beverage brand. Still, Coca-Cola has generally been unable to overcome the headwinds in the industry as American and others turn away from sugary drinks and diet sodas in favor of water, coffee, and other beverages outside of Coke's brand family. Who's the better buy? Coke and Procter & Gamble face similar situations today. Many investors will look to these stocks for their dividends. Coca-Cola has a slightly better dividend yield at 3.4% against P&G's 3.2% yield. Coke has also offered bigger dividend raises in recent years, so it's likely to remain the better dividend payer, share appreciation notwithstanding. Each company has a similar payout ratio in the 75% range. While I believe both sectors, beverages and household products, offer better picks than these two, of the two stocks P&G seems to be the better choice. The company has delivered better earnings growth recently, and is not facing the same challenges in consumer tastes that soda is. If Procter & Gamble can overcome its challenges in grooming, the stock should be back on track. Jeremy Bowman has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Since only 12% of menstruating women in India use sanitary napkins, questions haven’t been raised on hygiene and safety standards and practised by the makers Subscribe to our newsletter. Ashwaq Masoodi Padma Shri awardee Arunachalam Murugunantham shows his low-cost sanitary napkin making machine. Photo: HT New Delhi: A woman enters the store, picks up a pack or mumbles the name of the brand she wants under her breath to the storekeeper, who proceeds to wrap the product in an old newspaper and hands it to her in a black plastic bag. She pays in awkward silence before hurriedly exiting the shop. That’s typically how a woman buys a pack of sanitary napkins in India, where the topic of menstrual hygiene is usually not discussed in genteel company, let alone in public. So how does one begin to ask questions about what goes into the making of a product that people are hesitant to even mention aloud? Further, since sanitary napkins are classified as “medical products”, companies are not required by law to disclose what goes into their making on product packs. Procter and Gamble’s Whisper and Johnson and Johnson’s Stayfree brands dominate the Indian sanitary napkins market. Photo: Indranil Bhoumik/Mint There is no research to attest that sanitary napkins sold in India are safe. But the use of some chemicals in the feminine hygiene products raises questions over how safe they really are. “It is a sanitary napkin. Its purpose is not just to absorb. Hygiene parameters of the product, of how safe they are, should be disclosed on the packets. Unfortunately, people choose sanitary napkins based on the cost, design and packaging,” said Bhawana Chanana, associate professor in the department of fabric and apparel science at Lady Irwin College, Delhi University. “But the main consideration really should be hygiene— what’s the pH range, for instance. But women don’t ask simply because they are embarrassed and this has worked to the advantage of the manufacturers and sellers,” added Chanana, who said she has come across instances where products rejected in the US or Germany have been recycled in India. "It is a sanitary napkin. Its purpose is not just to absorb. Hygiene parameters of the product, of how safe they are, should be disclosed on the packets. Unfortunately, people choose sanitary napkins based on the cost, design and packaging"- Bhawana Chanana, associate professor, department of fabric and apparel science, Lady Irwin College in Delhi In fact, in 2003, Ahmedabad-based Consumer Education and Research Centre tested 19 brands of sanitary napkins available in the market and found dirt and ants on some of the samples tested. When products in the market are certified by official agencies, consumers assume they are safe. In India, sanitary pads are tested as per standards that haven’t been updated since 1980. “On the basis of that standard, all sanitary pads will pass the tests. This needs to change; more parameters need to be added. We need to have parameters to check how safe these products are,” said Jinoj K., chief executive officer of Wager Hygiene, a maker of health and personal care products including sanitary napkins. Jinoj is also the founder of Chennai-based Centre for Hygiene Research and Development. The Bureau of Indian Standards 1980 specifies tests that are very basic. For instance, to determine whether the absorbent fillers in the sanitary napkins are lumpy and whether the surface of the pads feels soft and comfortable enough. However, there is no requirement to test the toxicity of ingredients. Staffers at non-profit Goonj make sanitary pads from donated clothes. Photograph: Priyanka Parashar/Mint In the US, the Food and Drug Administration guidelines recommend biocompatibility testing of napkins, appropriate for the duration and level of contact of a user with the product. The FDA guidelines also state that the approving authority is aware of risks such as adverse tissue reaction, vaginal injury and toxic shock syndrome, associated with usage of these products and recommends that companies conduct preclinical toxicology and preclinical microbiology tests. The process involved in the making of sanitary pads in India hasn’t changed in decades. The only changes are cosmetic, said nanotechnologist Chandra Shekhar Sharma from the Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad’s department of chemical engineering. “No one denies the health hazards of using these commercially sold napkins. But scientifically there is much more to study before we reach a conclusion. Concerns about certain adverse effects are valid but not yet quantified,” he added. The purpose of a sanitary pad is to absorb and retain menstrual fluid discharge, prevent leaks and of course help a woman stay comfortable. For these reasons, sanitary pads are made of different layers—the cover stock, acquisition and distribution layer, absorbent core, back sheet, and siliconized paper. Sanitary pads are made of different layers—the cover stock, acquisition and distribution layer, absorbent core, back sheet, and siliconized paper. Photo: Priyanka Parashar/Mint “The absorbent layer is the key component of the napkin and the extent to which this layer is able to absorb and retain the fluid determines the efficiency of the napkin. This bulk layer of a napkin is a non woven web, made of hydrophilic cellulosic staple fibers like wood pulp, cotton linters, viscose etc. Most of the wood pulp used for the purpose is imported, and therefore expensive, increasing the overall cost of a sanitary napkin. Cotton is seen as a major fiber poised to replace wood pulp especially in the feminine hygiene products where less bulky is preferred and thinner is better. The high cost of cotton is the reason why it has not been able to replace pulp,” according to Chanana’s paper Design and Development of Low Cost Sanitary Napkins using Cotton Knitwear Waste, published in Health Positive, Journal of Best Practices in Clinical Medicine and Public Health, November 2009. Since absorption is the key to efficiency, products use superabsorbent polymers (SAPs) either in the form of granules within cellulosic fibre matrix or in the form of composite fabric layer. By adding SAPs, the pad can hold water up to 30 times its weight. This absorbent layer, which is the main component, is attached to a permeable top sheet (made of non-woven, mainly spunlace fabric), then attached to a non-permeable bottom sheet (made of polyethylene). The three layers are later glued and sealed to prevent leakage by using heat or ultrasonic vibrations. Sharma’s team is looking at the potential use of electrospun cellulose acetate nanofibres to make the absorbent core of sanitary napkins, instead of SAPs that are currently used. The team uses a technique called electrospinning to produce cellulose based nano-fibers. Nanofibres are generally more than a hundred times thinner than human hair. As the nanofibres have a much larger surface area and porosity, they can absorb much more fluid even without adding SAPs. Sharma said since this is a nano-fabric, its surface finish and also the comfort factor is found to be better than that of regular napkins. A. Muruganatham sanitary napkin-making workshop in Coimbatore. Photo: HT In India, price plays an important role. And, pricing is decided based on what additional features the sanitary pads offer. “The MRP (maximum retail price) depends on the incremental product benefits offered by a particular product, which could be longer length, wider back, superior absorption and wetness protection, or gentleness on skin,” said a P&G India spokesperson. So the add-ons are mostly cosmetic, and not really hygiene related. Srinivas Krishnaswamy of Krya Consumer Products Llp, a company that deals in plant-based products for sustainable urban living, worked with Johnson and Johnson (J&J) India from 2001-09. “Working in the sanitary napkin market, I know that absorption and cost were the only two factors that were taken into consideration. I doubt it has changed,” said Krishnaswamy. The Indian sanitary napkin market at the moment is dominated by P&G and J&J. According to a 2016 report by market researcher Euromonitor International, P&G’s Whisper brand led value sales with a share of 50.4%, followed by J&J’s Stayfree with 23% (with higher usage in rural areas) and Kimberly Clark Corp.’s Kotex with 2.2 %. Chemical concerns Even though all the leading brands in the Indian sanitary market are global ones and sell the same products worldwide, the quality of the chemicals used in India is believed to be inferior. According to a senior executive at one of the sanitary napkin makers, who has worked in both developing and developed countries for close to two decades, use of inferior quality components to reduce cost is not new and companies cannot be blamed as they do not need to comply with any specified safety or hygiene standards in India. “What companies usually follow is the US Food and Drug Administration standards. But the constituents in these pads behave differently in the Indian environment, which is humid and sweaty, as against environments that are cool and dry. But things have improved in the recent years,” the executive said, asking not to be named. The most contested constituents of sanitary pads are dioxins and SAPs. According to a 2016 paper, High absorbency cellulose acetate electrospun nanofibers for feminine hygiene application, by IIT-Hyderabad’s Sharma and his colleagues Shital Yadav, Mani Pujitha Illa and Tulika Rastogi, “Dioxins are used to bleach the cotton/material used for making absorbent core, and it is responsible for side effects in the body such as pelvic inflammatory disease, ovarian cancer, immune system damage, impaired fertility and diabetes. SAPs are added to increase the absorption capacity, but in 1980s, use of SAPs was restricted in tampons (in the US) due to its possible link with toxic shock syndrome, a potentially fatal illness caused by a bacterial toxin.” "What (sanitary napkin) companies usually follow is the US FDA standards. But the constituents in these pads behave differently in the Indian environment, which is humid and sweaty, as against environments that are cool and dry. But things have improved in the recent years"- A senior executive at one of the sanitary napkin makers Due to the omnipresence of dioxins, the World Health Organization says not all the exposure will affect human health. However, due to the highly toxic potential (dioxin accumulates in the body fat and can add up to the residual levels over time), efforts need to be undertaken to reduce current background exposure. A 1993 study (conducted over 10 years) found that 79% of a group of monkeys in the US developed endometriosis (a disorder in which the tissue that forms the lining of the uterus grows outside the uterus) after exposure to dioxin in their food. The severity of endometriosis was directly related to the amount of TCDD (2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin—the most toxic dioxin) to which the monkeys had been exposed. Those that were fed dioxin in amounts as small as five parts per trillion also developed endometriosis. The dioxin-exposed monkeys also showed immune abnormalities similar to those observed in women with endometriosis. “These products seem innocuous but they may be laced with dioxins, petrochemicals, Genetically Modified Organisms and fragrances. When these chemicals come in contact with sensitive skin, tissue may get irritated. Dioxins are carcinogenic in nature hence the risk of cancer increases even at very low levels of exposure,” write Anuradha Barman, S.D. Asagekar and Pooja Katkar in the paper An Overview on Sanitary Napkins published on Technicaltextile.net. Some of the variants of the products sold by P&G come with fragrances. The company does not disclose what fragrance it uses, but states that it meets safety standards set by the International Fragrance Association. Route of exposure Menstrual pads sold commercially are designed in such a way that they have direct contact with the vaginal area. The vulvar and vaginal tissues are structurally different from the skin of the rest of the body, being more permeable and covered in mucous membranes. The mucous membranes and the fact that the walls of the vagina are filled with numerous blood vessels and lymphatic vessels, allow for direct transfer of chemicals into the circulatory system, without being metabolized first. But studies say while rapid absorption can work well when a patient needs a drug delivered rapidly, it may also expose women to higher levels of chemicals from feminine hygiene products since the area of contact has a direct route to a female’s reproductive organs. “Contrary to claims, most of what is in the market doesn’t even use cotton. It is mostly wood pulp. Almost all use the same materials, changes are in the form—how it looks and feels versus what materials are used. As for the chemicals used, every company will say that the quantity of chemicals, SAP or chlorine bleach they use will not kill you,” said Sarah McMillan, business development lead at Saathi Pads, a start-up that makes biodegradable sanitary pads. The plastic revolution changed the nature of the sanitary napkin. SAP and polyethylene (for back cover) made the napkins waterproof. The polypropylene top sheet kept it dry. Today sanitary pads are almost entirely made of plastic material. And even the plastic used is of an inferior quality. “While all our products are required to meet the strict safety expectations of regulatory bodies such as the US Food and Drug Administration, to make sure we meet the highest standards of safety expectations, we also share our feminine care product information with independent experts including medical consultants and university scientists, and publish our safety studies in scientific and medical journals,” the P&G India spokesperson said in an emailed response. Spokespersons for J&J India and Kimberly-Clark (Asia Pacific) declined to comment. Only 12% of menstruating Indian women use sanitary napkins, questions haven’t been raised on how these pads are made and, consequently, there isn’t much pressure on companies to make better quality products Since only 12% of menstruating Indian women use sanitary napkins, questions haven’t been raised over how these pads are made, and consequently there isn’t much pressure on companies to come up with better quality products. Padma Shri awardee Arunachalam Murugunantham, inventor of a low-cost sanitary pad making machine in Tamil Nadu, said those living in the metros tend to think that the real India is the India of the cities. “Ninety per cent of those who don’t even have access to sanitary napkins are facing many more adverse effects than these 10-12% who are using the wrong ones,” said Murugunantham, whose start-up Jayaashree Industries has manufactured more than 1,300 machines that are installed across 27 states in India and seven other countries. "We are fighting to make sanitary pads accessible to every woman. It is because of the ads like those which claim day-long protection that women are misled about the duration for which it is safe to use one pad. If they know they should change after every four hours, they will be saved from infections"- Arunachalam Murugunantham “We are fighting to make sanitary pads accessible to every woman. It is because of the ads like those which claim day-long protection that women are misled about the duration for which it is safe to use one pad. If they know they should change after every four hours, they will be saved from infections,” he added. Even the 12% of Indian women who have access to these products—each one would be using on average 11,000-17,000 sanitary napkins in her lifetime—deserve to know what goes onto and into their bodies.

Ralph Lauren posts quarterly loss a day after naming new CEO by: ANNE D\'INNOCENZIO, AP Retail Writer Updated: May 18, 2017 - 3:48 PM NEW YORK (AP) - Preppy clothing retailer Ralph Lauren Corp. reported a quarterly loss and another drop in revenue on Thursday, a day after announcing a new chief executive. The latest report from the company known for its polo shirts and pony logo underscores the challenges that Patrice Louvet, who was a Procter & Gamble beauty executive, faces when he start the CEO job in July. Like other retailers, Ralph Lauren's revenue has been hurt as more shoppers skip department stores and choose to shop online. Last month, the company closed its high-profile Polo store on New York's Fifth Avenue and said it may close other stores, cut jobs and shut down some corporate offices. The brand has also lost luster with shoppers because it can be found many places and had been too reliant on discounting to get shoppers to buy. Consumers also have lots of options online for their fix on status goods. Retail revenue in the fourth quarter fell 16 percent, driven by a decline in revenue at established stores that were hurt by weak customer traffic and a lower average transaction total. Sales at established stores dropped for the ninth straight quarter. Much may depend on how Louvet and Lauren work together. Louvet replaces Stefan Larsson, who was the first person other than Lauren himself to hold the CEO title. But Larsson announced in February that he would leave after less than two years, after he and Lauren clashed over creative control. Lauren said the decision to part was mutual. Louvet will report to Lauren, who is the company's executive chairman of the board and chief creative officer. In announcing Louvet's hiring, Lauren cited his collaborative working style. "Finding the right partner to work with me to take us forward in our evolution has been my primary focus over the last several months," Lauren said. The New York-based company has been working to cut the number of products it offers and shorten the lead time from when items are conceived to when they get to stores. Over the past year, inventory was down 30 percent and the number of items was down 20 percent for the spring and fall 2017 seasons. The company said it now has 50 percent of its business on a nine-month lead cycle and plans to have 90 percent on that cycle by the end of fiscal 2018. As a result, revenue from its wholesale accounts in the fourth quarter decreased 17 percent to $777 million. "While Ralph Lauren is supposed to be a premium brand, it has become far too ubiquitous and in so doing has become less special," said Neil Saunders, managing director of research firm GlobalData Retail. "It simply isn't credible for a high-end brand to simultaneously showcase itself in a glitzy store on Madison Avenue while at the same time hawking a random assortment of sweaters thrown in a ragtag way on a table in Macy's. The two are incongruous and, ultimately, cheapen the image of the brand. We see some early signs of Ralph Lauren pulling back from less favorable channels, but it needs to work much faster if it is to rebuild its cachet." Overall, the company reported a loss of $204 million, or $2.48 per share, in the quarter. Earnings, adjusted for restructuring costs, came to 89 cents per share. The results topped the average estimate of nine analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research for earnings of 79 cents per share. Revenue for the quarter came to $1.57 billion, down from $1.87 billion a year earlier. That missed the forecast of three analysts surveyed by Zacks for $1.59 billion. Before Thursday's trading, Ralph Lauren shares had decreased 19 percent since the beginning of the year. The shares fell 1.8 percent, or $1.31, to $71.44 on Thursday. _____ Elements of this story was generated by Automated Insights (http://automatedinsights.com/ap) using data from Zacks Investment Research.

 These 7 companies control almost every single beauty product you buy Megan Willett and Skye Gould, INSIDER May 18, 2017, 1:44 PM 16,061 facebook linkedin twitter email print Skye Gould/INSIDER The INSIDER Summary: Beauty is a big industry with hundreds of brands. 182 of those brands are owned by seven conglomerates. They employ thousands and make billions of dollars each year. They also are responsible for advertising and the way we think about beauty. As consumers, we like to think that we're making a conscious decision when we buy from a certain brand, especially when it comes to something as personal as beauty products. But it turns out that 182 beauty companies fall under the massive umbrellas of seven huge manufacturers. Inspired by a similar graphic that shows all of the food brands owned by major corporations, INSIDER created our own infographic that illustrates all the major beauty brands and the parent companies that they fall under. These seven mega-companies — Estée Lauder Companies, L'Oréal, Unilever, Procter and Gamble, Shiseido, Johnson and Johnson, and Coty — employ thousands of people around the world and make billions of dollars in revenue every year. They also are responsible for controlling advertising and the way we all think about beauty every day. Each of these seven conglomerates has more than just the sub-brands we listed here, but for our purposes, INSIDER chose to stick with brands that are responsible for skin care (for both the body and face), hair care, perfume, and makeup. We did not include brands that only made products such as deodorant, toothpaste, suntan lotion, or baby lotion, but did count the sub-brands of relevant brands (i.e. Pantene and Pantene Pro-V). What remains is a compelling look at who controls the beauty products we're buying, from fan-favorites like CoverGirl to expensive and aspirational skincare lines like La Mer. And it's mind-boggling to see how interconnected consumer brands truly are. Estée Lauder Companies. Skye Gould/INSIDER Estée Lauder Companies was responsible for 24 of the beauty brands on this list. Some of their holdings include the makeup and fragrances by fashion brands such as Donna Karan, Michael Kors, Tom Ford, Tommy Hilfiger, and Tory Burch, each of which have their own cosmetics and/or toiletries lines. They also have quite a few well-known beauty brands such as Aveda, Bobbi Brown, Clinique, La Mer, and MAC Cosmetics. Estée Lauder as a whole made an estimated $11.3 billion in beauty sales in 2016, according to Beauty Packaging.  L'Oréal. Skye Gould/INSIDER L'Oréal had the most brands on this list with a total of 39 beauty brands, including major staples like Lancôme, Maybelline, Urban Decay, Garner, Essie, and The Body Shop. They also have very expensive skincare and haircare brands, including Pureology, La Roche-Posay, and SkinCeuticals. In 2016, it was estimated they made $27.6 billion in beauty annual sales, according to Beauty Packaging. Unilever. Skye Gould/INSIDER Unilever has 38 total beauty sub-brands, and many of those are staples in drugstores in the US, including Nexxus, Ponds, TIGI, Dove, Vaseline, and Lever 2000. Unilever also has quite a few brands popular outside the US, including Fair & Lovely, a “fairness cream” that's marketed in India as a skin-lightening lotion for women. It's worth noting that it has received backlash for promoting one shade of skin as better than another. Unilever made an estimated $58.2 billion in corporate sales last year, according to Beauty Packaging. $22.3 was from beauty sales. Skye Gould/INSIDER Procter & Gamble has 9 total beauty brands, with an emphasis on big name brands, including Head & Shoulders, Herbal Essences, Olay, and Gillette. The company made an estimated $76 billion from corporate sales in 2016, according to Beauty Packaging, $18 billion of which was for beauty sales. The corporation recently sold many of its beauty brands to Coty in 2016. Coty. Skye Gould/INSIDER Speaking of Coty, it has come out as a new leader in the beauty industry with 33 total brands. After acquiring many brands from Procter & Gamble, Coty now owns numerous big name products, including OPI, Rimmel, Covergirl, and is behind celebrity toiletries like Katy Perry, David Beckham, and Beyoncé, among others. In 2016, Coty made an estimated $4.3 billion in beauty sales, according got Beauty Packaging. After their 2016 acquisition, we expect this number to rise dramatically. Shiseido. Skye Gould/INSIDER Shiseido — itself a well-known skincare brand — has about 30 other beauty brands underneath it. Some of those are also makeup brands, including bareMinerals, Nars, and Laura Mercier. The vast majority are brands that might not be recognized in the US, including Japanese brands such as Majolica Majorca, Ettusais, Maquillage, and Aqua Label, which also claims to "whiten" skin.  The Japanese corporation made an estimated $6.3 billion in beauty sales in 2016, according to Beauty Packaging. Johnson and Johnson. Skye Gould/INSIDER And finally, the last major brand we included on this list is on the smaller side with nine beauty brands, but what it lacks in quantity it makes up for in name recognition. Johnson and Johnson is a bigger umbrella company that includes nine beauty brands, including Aveeno, Neutrogena, Clean and Clear, and RoC, in addition to a few others. The company also made quite a bit of money in skincare — $7.1 billion in 2016 to be exact, according to Beauty Packaging. Read the original article on INSIDER. Follow INSIDER on Facebook.

Email Newsletters Sign up for one of our email newsletters. NEW YORK — Ralph Lauren Corp. has tapped Procter & Gamble beauty executive Patrice Louvet as its next CEO as the preppy fashion brand seeks to turn its business around. The company known for its polo shirts and pony logo said Wednesday that Louvet will start in July. He will replace Stefan Larsson, who announced in February that he would leave the New York-based company after less than two years in the job. Larsson was the first person other than company founder Ralph Lauren to hold the title. The two clashed over creative control, though Lauren said the decision to part was mutual. In the announcement about Louvet, Lauren cited his collaborative working style. “Finding the right partner to work with me to take us forward in our evolution has been my primary focus over the last several months,” Lauren said. Like other retailers, Ralph Lauren's revenue has been hurt as more shoppers skip department stores and choose to shop online. Last month, the company closed its high-profile Polo store on New York's Fifth Avenue and said it may close other stores, cut jobs and shutdown some corporate offices. Louvet was most recently president of Procter & Gamble's beauty brands, which includes Pantene shampoo and Olay anti-wrinkle cream. He will report to Lauren, who is the company's executive chairman of the board and chief creative officer. Shares of Ralph Lauren slipped $1.19 to close Wednesday at $72.75. They are down 19 percent so far this year.

Ibraheem Abbas pushes the boundaries of Arab culture in the 21st century. (Photos by Amina Al-Jeffery) Abbas’ first novel, “HWJN”, is about a 90-year-old jinn. 3 photos Novelist Ibraheem Abbas is a pioneer in a genre that is more than a century old. Taking the best elements of science fiction popularized in the West by such greats as Ray Bradbury’s “The Martian Chronicles” to anything by Arthur C. Clarke, Abbas has added a Saudi twist with his own stories by conflating Arab mythology and SciFi. Abbas is a rare breed in Saudi Arabia. In addition to mixing sci-fi, fantasy and adolescent adventure, he is also a creative director and filmmaker. He co-founded Yatakhayalon (The League of Arabic SciFiers), a publishing house, and hopes to enrich the Kingdom by encouraging an Arabic sci-fi culture. Sitting with Abbas, one feels he is a unique sort of blend between a moderate and ideologue, both in his writing and as a person. The common denominator in each of his pieces is his singular ability to blend Arab history with a futuristic punch. He graduated with a bachelor’s degree in computer engineering, being the closest to his aspired field of graphic and 3-D design. He also worked in marketing at Procter & Gamble. Springing from one field to another, seeking a position where his talent could be exercised and prosper, Abbas was eventually rescued by the burgeoning Saudi advertising industry during the time in which he found the title “creative director.” Certainly working as a creative director provided an outlet for Abbas’ fertile imagination, but it was writing fantasy and SciFi that fulfilled him. His first novel, “HWJN,” is the story of forbidden love between a 90-year-old supernatural jinn, who experiences his first interactions with the human dimension through a relationship with a young woman. The novel is told from the perspective of the supernatural creatures and cleverly conveys their standpoint on humans. (In Islam, jinn are extraterrestrial, invisible creatures believed to have been made from “smokeless fire by God.”) In writing “HWJN,” Abbas had no intention of publishing the story. It was merely a medium where he could channel his “personal creative journey” in which he allowed his notions to roam free. But when he ultimately decided to publish “HWJN,” Abbas and his partner, Yasser Bahjatt, hit a brick wall. Publishers didn’t want it. It was too fantastical for Arab tastes. As a result, they were compelled to launch Yatakhayloon where it was successfully published. Thereafter, “HWJN”, according to Wired Magazine, fueled “rumors, particularly from parents, that it was promoting sorcery and devil-worship” among the youth. As the book received more attention, religious authorities were reluctant to see “HWJN” on Saudi bookshelves for the same reason. Nevertheless, the book hit the top of Saudi Arabia’s best-seller list in 2013. Readers were quick to latch onto Abbas’ stories hoping it would establish a dialogue between Western and Arabic sci-fi. After gaining positive recognition internationally, the January 2014 New York Review of Science Fiction said, “It’s a great YA (young adults) novel... one which would go down very well with a Western YA readership.” Not all Western sci-fi readers shared the same enthusiasm and some skeptical Saudis had difficulty accepting other aspects of the story. It was thought to have presented a view of women that would be deemed patronizing to Western readers. Arab-English book reviewer Ian Campbell said: “The ending is deeply problematic from a liberal Western viewpoint.” Having said that, Abbas acknowledges the fact that this very detail “sneaks into another kind of patronizing expectation that a book can only be good if it reflects our prejudices. This is a book that we SciFi readers in the West can learn from.” Subsequent to success the of “HWJN,” Abbas was encouraged to write Hunak. In lieu of writing sequels, as is often a convention in a second-book release, Abbas seamlessly ties the knot with his third book, “Binyameen.” His latest piece, “The Hypnotized Ones,” is a narrative of three Arabic historical figures, each possessing their own pronounced characteristics that are the direct antithesis of the others. He carefully refrains from burdening his writing with philosophical meanings. His distinctive style is the product of employing limited resources to spark inquisition in the minds of his audience. He says his objective is to deliver “entertainment,” plain and simple. “Sometimes, yes, some of my readers discover strong messages I had not even intended on,” Abbas said. Abbas tells Arab News that creating a “fun” experience for people is what prompts him to write. Furthermore, he wants to encourage open-mindedness in his readers’ minds and challenge engineered societal conformities. Abbas possesses a fiery passion for sci-fi. He thrives a little on pushing boundaries. Promoting a genre that is more or less ignored in this region, he pares away everything pertaining to the mere shadow of orthodoxy. He advises young talents to pivot their predominant and transient aspirations of reaching fame to finding fulfillment in doing what they love to do. He believes that young Saudis answer to, and perform better, in competitive networks. He suggests that more platforms, where they can showcase their work, would generate more Saudi talent and produce higher quality work. Abbas notes that as young Saudi talent rises, impediments they face grow proportionally. They become subject to the abrasive censuring of a society whose principal concern is the way in which the next person perceives them. Measured by the unregulated and variable interpretations of the “norms,” individuals construct a meager and feigned attempt at creative art, he believes. “A false and enforced perfection,” Abbas observes. The very act of molding art to please conflicting ideologies in society will undoubtedly render the product watered down. Often Abbas feels that myriad Saudi dreams have died at confronting the question, “What will other people think of me?” He believes that being raised by parents who anchored tolerance in their home contributed to his experimental nature. In a large family, however, where undivided attention is scarce, Abbas said he learned “to create my own atmosphere, and invent my own toys, my own fun.” Abbas is realizing his plans of converting “HWJN” into a movie. He has faith it will be a quantum leap in the sci-fi genre and will excite a succession of productions in the region. — Email: [email protected] Novelist Ibraheem Abbas is a pioneer in a genre that is more than a century old.

More information is available at https://free.obviouscandidate.com London, United Kingdom – May 18, 2017 /NewsNetwork/ — Personal branding expert, 6-figure career coach and Amazon Kindle bestselling author Sam Waterfall is giving away his brand new book, „The Obvious Candidate Job Search Acceleration Guide”. The ebook give away began on May 1, 2017, with the download available exclusively from www.free.obviouscandidate.com and is already a big hit among ambitious and frustrated job seekers worldwide. More information on the ebook, together with free download access to view it on mobile devices or computers, can be found here: https://free.obviouscandidate.com This is the fifth book Waterfall has authored. The ebook was written with the aim of enabling ambitious job seekers and promotion hunters to accelerate their move into the right next role. There’s also particular excitement about this launch because this free-to-download guide shares the proven strategies that have helped Waterfall’s personal coaching clients land jobs with many of the world’s most sought-after organisations including Facebook, McKinsey&Co., Adidas, P&G, Virgin, Coca Cola, Red Bull Racing, Barclays Capital, The Economist and many more. The Obvious Candidate Job Search Acceleration Guide sets its main focus on cutting out the frustrations of job search by applying the principles of successful marketing and psychology to employment search scenarios. Readers will likely find a particular interest in how the average job seeker takes 17 interviews to land their next role and how applying the 7 simple ideas in this new ebook can cut that effort in half. The ebook’s cover art was created by www.thinkinganew.uk and The Obvious Candidate Job Search Acceleration Guide is being released by Obvious Candidate in conjunction with Obvious Publishing. Sam Waterfall has a background in marketing products and services for many of the world’s leading corporations, but discovered that his real passion was for helping ambitious people to brand and market themselves. This helped shaped the creation of the book with the application of the same proven methods that enable the leading consumer brands to stand out on the retail shelves to be adapted and used to differentiate job seekers. Waterfall’s methods enable them to position themselves as the Obvious Candidate in any job search. When asked about why he wrote the book, Waterfall said: „After coaching many 6-figure earning clients to job search success, I know what works and what doesn’t when it comes to landing competitive roles with the most popular employer brands. With this ebook, I’m trying to expand the reach of my proven methods. And with its free price tag, I’m doing all I can to put this important and life-changing knowledge into the hands of as many people as possible – whatever their current wealth or employment status.” Waterfall has hopes that the ebook will help ambitious job seekers and promotion hunters land the jobs they want faster than they ever thought possible. This positive outlook from the author is certainly testament to his optimism considering some of the mishaps during its creation. At one point they had trouble with the servers, making sure they would be able to cope with the demand of the launch of a free ebook on such a popular topic. The launch was also delayed while all the interactive links to relevant sites and ongoing updating content were confirmed. Waterfall insisted the guide must be evergreen, with live links to relevant and current content from www.obviouscandidate.com and beyond. In a recent interview, the author made a point of thanking all his personal clients, who have shaped and honed these strategies over the past 14 years, for their part in the creation of the book, saying: „It’s the hundreds of personal clients who’ve made these strategies possible to share. And I’m enormously grateful to each and every one of them for that. We’ve developed these 7 strategies together, tested them together. They’ve worked for me. They’ve worked for my clients and they’ll work for any ambitious job seeker or promotion hunter who takes steps to put them into action.” Those interested in learning more about the book and downloading a free copy can visit: https://free.obviouscandidate.com More details about Waterfall’s other coaching programmes can be found at http://obviouscandidate.com Contact Info: Name: Sam Waterfall Organization: Obvious Marketing Ltd.

Waterfall insisted the guide must be evergreen, with live links to relevant and current content from www.obviouscandidate.com and beyond. In a recent interview, the author made a point of thanking all his personal clients, who have shaped and honed these strategies over the past 14 years, for their part in the creation of the book, saying: "It's the hundreds of personal clients who've made these strategies possible to share. And I'm enormously grateful to each and every one of them for that. We've developed these 7 strategies together, tested them together. They've worked for me. They've worked for my clients and they'll work for any ambitious job seeker or promotion hunter who takes steps to put them into action."

The latest report from the company known for its polo shirts and pony logo underscores the challenges that Patrice Louvet, who was a Procter & Gamble beauty executive, faces when he start the CEO job in July. Like other retailers, Ralph Lauren's revenue has been hurt as more shoppers skip department stores and choose to shop online. Last month, the company closed its high-profile Polo store on New York's Fifth Avenue and said it may close other stores, cut jobs and shut down some corporate offices. The brand has also lost luster with shoppers because it can be found many places and had been too reliant on discounting to get shoppers to buy. Consumers also have lots of options online for their fix on status goods. Retail revenue in the fourth quarter fell 16 percent, driven by a decline in revenue at established stores that were hurt by weak customer traffic and a lower average transaction total. Sales at established stores dropped for the ninth straight quarter. Much may depend on how Louvet and Lauren work together. Louvet replaces Stefan Larsson, who was the first person other than Lauren himself to hold the CEO title. But Larsson announced in February that he would leave after less than two years, after he and Lauren clashed over creative control. Lauren said the decision to part was mutual. Louvet will report to Lauren, who is the company's executive chairman of the board and chief creative officer. In announcing Louvet's hiring, Lauren cited his collaborative working style. "Finding the right partner to work with me to take us forward in our evolution has been my primary focus over the last several months," Lauren said. The New York-based company has been working to cut the number of products it offers and shorten the lead time from when items are conceived to when they get to stores. Over the past year, inventory was down 30 percent and the number of items was down 20 percent for the spring and fall 2017 seasons. The company said it now has 50 percent of its business on a nine-month lead cycle and plans to have 90 percent on that cycle by the end of fiscal 2018. As a result, revenue from its wholesale accounts in the fourth quarter decreased 17 percent to $777 million. "While Ralph Lauren is supposed to be a premium brand, it has become far too ubiquitous and in so doing has become less special," said Neil Saunders, managing director of research firm GlobalData Retail. "It simply isn't credible for a high-end brand to simultaneously showcase itself in a glitzy store on Madison Avenue while at the same time hawking a random assortment of sweaters thrown in a ragtag way on a table in Macy's. The two are incongruous and, ultimately, cheapen the image of the brand. We see some early signs of Ralph Lauren pulling back from less favorable channels, but it needs to work much faster if it is to rebuild its cachet." Overall, the company reported a loss of $204 million, or $2.48 per share, in the quarter. Earnings, adjusted for restructuring costs, came to 89 cents per share. The results topped the average estimate of nine analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research for earnings of 79 cents per share. Revenue for the quarter came to $1.57 billion, down from $1.87 billion a year earlier. That missed the forecast of three analysts surveyed by Zacks for $1.59 billion. Ralph Lauren's shares fell 1.4 percent, or $1.37, to close at $71.38 on Thursday. They are down 21 percent so far this year. _____ Elements of this story was generated by Automated Insights (http://automatedinsights.com/ap) using data from Zacks Investment Research.

The latest report from the company known for its polo shirts and pony logo underscores the challenges that Patrice Louvet, who was a Procter & Gamble beauty executive, faces when he start the CEO job in July. Like other retailers, Ralph Lauren’s revenue has been hurt as more shoppers skip department stores and choose to shop online. Last month, the company closed its high-profile Polo store on New York’s Fifth Avenue and said it may close other stores, cut jobs and shut down some corporate offices. The brand has also lost luster with shoppers because it can be found many places and had been too reliant on discounting to get shoppers to buy. Consumers also have lots of options online for their fix on status goods. Retail revenue in the fourth quarter fell 16 percent, driven by a decline in revenue at established stores that were hurt by weak customer traffic and a lower average transaction total. Sales at established stores dropped for the ninth straight quarter. The Pentagon may be shopping with you on Amazon Advertisement Much may depend on how Louvet and Lauren work together. Louvet replaces Stefan Larsson, who was the first person other than Lauren himself to hold the CEO title. But Larsson announced in February that he would leave after less than two years, after he and Lauren clashed over creative control. Lauren said the decision to part was mutual. Louvet will report to Lauren, who is the company’s executive chairman of the board and chief creative officer. In announcing Louvet’s hiring, Lauren cited his collaborative working style. “Finding the right partner to work with me to take us forward in our evolution has been my primary focus over the last several months,” Lauren said. The New York-based company has been working to cut the number of products it offers and shorten the lead time from when items are conceived to when they get to stores. Over the past year, inventory was down 30 percent and the number of items was down 20 percent for the spring and fall 2017 seasons. The company said it now has 50 percent of its business on a nine-month lead cycle and plans to have 90 percent on that cycle by the end of fiscal 2018. As a result, revenue from its wholesale accounts in the fourth quarter decreased 17 percent to $777 million. “While Ralph Lauren is supposed to be a premium brand, it has become far too ubiquitous and in so doing has become less special,” said Neil Saunders, managing director of research firm GlobalData Retail. “It simply isn’t credible for a high-end brand to simultaneously showcase itself in a glitzy store on Madison Avenue while at the same time hawking a random assortment of sweaters thrown in a ragtag way on a table in Macy’s. The two are incongruous and, ultimately, cheapen the image of the brand. We see some early signs of Ralph Lauren pulling back from less favorable channels, but it needs to work much faster if it is to rebuild its cachet.” Check out Federal News Radio's latest podcasts. Overall, the company reported a loss of $204 million, or $2.48 per share, in the quarter. Earnings, adjusted for restructuring costs, came to 89 cents per share. The results topped the average estimate of nine analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research for earnings of 79 cents per share. Revenue for the quarter came to $1.57 billion, down from $1.87 billion a year earlier. That missed the forecast of three analysts surveyed by Zacks for $1.59 billion. Before Thursday’s trading, Ralph Lauren shares had decreased 19 percent since the beginning of the year. The shares fell 1.8 percent, or $1.31, to $71.44 on Thursday. _____ Elements of this story was generated by Automated Insights (http://automatedinsights.com/ap) using data from Zacks Investment Research.

Rex Shutterstock Ralph Lauren Corp. today posted a net loss for its fourth quarter, but its overall results were better than market watchers had expected. The company — which announced Wednesday that former Procter & Gamble veteran Patrice Louvet would take the reins as its new president and CEO in July — said its net loss for the period was $204 million, or $2.48 per diluted share, compared with earnings of $41 million, or 49 cents per diluted share, in the same period last year. But adjusted earnings per diluted share, at 89 cents, were better than analysts’ bets for adjusted diluted EPS of 78 cents. Related Ralph Lauren Taps Procter & Gamble Veteran for CEO Post Reported revenue decreased 16 percent, to $1.6 billion, which was in line with market watchers’ forecasts. “The retail landscape today is more dynamic than ever, but within this environment, our brand continues to be one of the most recognized and beloved all over the world,” Ralph Lauren, executive chairman and chief creative officer, said in a release. “Our performance for the year reflects our work to strengthen our brand, and I am confident that the actions we are taking, combined with our strong heritage, position us well to succeed.” Ralph Lauren’s founder added that he is “very excited to partner with” Louvet. For the first time — in November 2015 — Lauren handed over the CEO reins of his company to former Old Navy executive Stefan Larsson. But creative differences led to an abrupt departure, announced in February 2017. (Larsson’s actual departure came on May 1.) During his brief tenure, Larsson implemented a “Way Forward” strategy that the company said it would continue to carry out following his exit. Ralph Lauren CFO Jane Nielson said the company has made important strides in the most recent fiscal year. “We created operational efficiencies, increased the productivity of our assortment and improved quality of our sales,” Nielson said. “In the fourth quarter, we continued to drive quality of sales up by moderating discount levels; lowered our inventory levels by 30 percent to improve inventory turns; reduced the number of SKUs by 20 percent for both Spring and Fall 2017 … optimized our store fleet by closing another 20 underperforming stores … [and] initiated the move to a more cost-effective, flexible e-commerce platform.” (The company made headlines this year when it announced its plans to shutter its flagship store on New York’s Fifth Avenue.) For the full year, revenue decreased 10 percent, to $6.7 billion. On a reported basis, net loss was $99 million, or $1.20 per share. On an adjusted basis, net income was $477 million, or $5.71 per diluted share. This compared with net income of $396 million, or $4.62 per diluted share on a reported basis, and $546 million, or $6.36 per diluted share, for fiscal 2016. For fiscal 2018, net revenue is expected to decrease 8 to 9 percent, excluding the impact of foreign currency. For the current quarter, the company expects net revenue to be down low double-digits, excluding the impact of foreign currency. As of 2:15 p.m., Ralph Lauren shares were down 1.4 percent, to $71.70. — Sign up for the FN Newsletter — Business, Earnings, Asia Pacific, Europe, North America, Ralph Lauren, Stefan Larsson Share This Article Reddit LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Print Talk Post navigation ← Reebok Is Coming Out With a ‘Bro Romper,’ Or Onesie for Active Men This Mom Actually Wore Yeezy Boosts to Her Graduation → Featured Gallery Celebrity Statement Shoes: May 2017 ALERTS & NEWSLETTERS SIGN UP PRIVACY POLICY Around The Web Latest Publication Footwear News 05/08/2017 Read Now Cannes: Where to Eat, Drink and Party Scandal Finale: Bellamy Young Reacts to [Spoiler]'s Death and… Stanley Tucci Joins John Leonetti's 'The Silence' – Cannes Harry Styles Hits All The High Notes & Performs A Rom-Com Scene… Over 500 million leaked logins hit the web in new master list Contact Us About Us Advertise Terms of Use Privacy Policy Your Privacy Rights Newsletters The Power of Content Variety india.com Hollywoodlife Deadline TV Line GOLDDERBY WWD © 2017 Fairchild Publishing, LLC, a subsidiary of Penske Business Media, LLC.

SPDR (ETF) (XLP): The Quick Guide to XLP The XLP ETF is one of the best for basic exposure to consumer staples By Todd Shriber, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  May 18, 2017, 1:45 pm EDT     Popular Posts: The 10 Best Low-Cost Index Funds to Buy Now iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology Index (ETF) (IBB): The Quick Guide to IBB The 10 Best Low-Cost Index Funds to Buy Now Recent Posts: Market Vector Russia ETF Trust (RSX): The Quick Guide to RSX Consumer Staples Select Sect. SPDR (ETF) (XLP): The Quick Guide to XLP iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology Index (ETF) (IBB): The Quick Guide to IBB View All Posts Consumer staples are a vital part of broader U.S. equity indices, and one of the most popular places of getting exposure to that sector is the Staples Select Sector SPDR (NYSEARCA:XLP). Consumer staples stocks are usually prized by investors seeking a defensive sector with dependable dividends. Looked at differently, consumer staples stocks and exchange traded funds (ETFs) can provide a little more excitement and more upside potential than U.S. government bonds without the volatility of more cyclical sectors. The S&P 500 allocates about 9.4% of its weight to consumer staples names, making the group the sixth-largest sector weight in the benchmark U.S. equity index. Investors can express views on this sector with an array of ETFs, though the largest of them is the XLP. SPDR’s XLP debuted in 1998 as one of State Street Global Advisors’ original nine sector funds, and today is the largest consumer staples play with about $9 billion in assets under management. The ETF tracks the Consumer Staples Select Sector Index and holds 39 stocks. A Basic ETF For Basic Stocks The consumer staples sector is not overly complex, and neither is XLP’s approach to the sector. The 10 Best ETFs on the Planet XLP is a cap-weighted ETF, meaning it assigns larger weights to the biggest consumer staples names. Procter & Gamble Co. (NYSE:PG), Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) and Coca-Cola Inc. (NYSE:KO) combine for over 30% of XLP’s weight. XLP’s top 10 holdings combine for almost two-thirds of the ETF’s weight. Consumer staples stocks and ETFs such as XLP have the potential to reduce portfolio volatility while boosting income. However, those pluses do not come free of charge. While not as bad as utilities, consumer staples are perceived as a rate-sensitive sector, meaning that when Treasury yields rise, investors are apt to depart this group. Another element of rising interest rates is a stronger U.S. dollar. A stronger dollar is a drag on U.S. multinationals, plenty of which are consumer staples names and members of XLP’s lineup. Companies like Procter & Gamble and Coca-Cola generate significant portions of their sales overseas, but that is not an advantage when the dollar is strong. XLP is not the cheapest consumer staples ETF, but its annual fee of 0.14%, $14 on a $10,000 investment, is reasonable below the average fee on U.S. ETFs. Trading costs won’t be inflated either, as this fund is the go-to consumer staples play for professional investors. That helps keep spreads tight.

On May 19-21, Armenia’s capital Yerevan will be hosting the fourth annual PR-summit, which is a unique platform for the exchange of knowledge and establishment of business ties between the leading PR specialists. This year, experienced speakers from Armenia, USA, Europe, Lebanon, Russia and the UAE, as well as representatives of the international agency Ketchum, Gaylord College of the University of Oklahoma and Byblos Bank will take part in the summit. On the eve of the event ARKA news agency talked to Yevgenia Kondrashova, customer service director at Ketchum (Moscow). She has a 12 years experience in PR-sector, having worked for such well-known companies as Hyattt Hotels Corporation, Emirates, Phillips, P&G, Samsonite, Whirlpool, etc. ARKA - Mrs. Kondrashova, in the age of the Internet the communications undergoes a serious transformation. In this connection, how would you assess the public and digital communications? What are their main advantages and disadvantages? Y. Kondrasheva - Due to personal experience I can comment, first of all, on the situation in Russia. Not only PR is changing dynamically, but the entire industry of communications and the pace of these changes are gaining momentum. The changes are due to the digital technologies, the evolution of the media market, changes in consumer behavior and preferences, and globalization. Communications become more integrated, multi-channel. Information is now available in real time in 24/7 format, for example, from a mobile phone no matter where you are. People consume information differently than before. And the format of the content has also changed. So, publications in print magazines are being replaced by videos created by bloggers; press releases and posts in the social network are being replaced by live-broadcast or brand-series. With the help of social networks today any Internet user can directly contact the management of a company to ask a question or make a comment on the quality of its products or services. Of course, this has a lot of advantages for both sides. Technologies open up new opportunities for innovation, creativity, creation of new communities not limited by geography and language of communication. But there are also new risks, because we regularly encounter unreliable information that can be misleading, undermine trust and damage reputation. ARKA - How actively are modern technologies and trends used? Y. Kondrasheva - It seems to me that Russia in many respects does not lag behind other markets. Now influencer marketing (promotion of goods and services through bloggers and leaders of public opinion in social networks) is actively developing. Our agency is actively working in this direction, and on a number of projects we interact every day with influencers along with professional journalists. Messengers for smartphones (Viber, WhatsApp, Telegram) have become popular. Many companies, media and ordinary users create their own channels, chat rooms, and chat bots in Telegram. We are lagging behind the western colleagues in terms of media measurements and assessing the effectiveness of communications due to a lack of expertise in the market, as well as investments in the development and implementation of relevant tools. But the demand for a quality assessment of PR is growing, so I'm sure that in this direction we will see progress. ARKA - Please indicate the main global trends in the field of digital communications and how to use them? Y. Kondrasheva - In addition to the mobile technologies mentioned above, the popularity of messengers and chat bots, as well as the influence of opinion leaders in social networks, I can note the following. For several years, the situational SMM - agile-content, newsjacking, realtime marketing has been globally popular. This is a daily tracking and use of hot topics for the production of content and obtaining viral coverage. And also the Internet of things - a network of objects connected via the Internet, capable of collecting data and exchanging data coming from embedded services. Today, the Internet is connected to cars, homes, not to mention all kinds of gadgets, whose diversity and functionality is constantly growing. The way we interact with technology has changed radically. Brands are increasingly resorting to innovations in the field of visual technology. There is a huge competition in the market for mobile video. The younger generation has completely replaced television with YouTube. It is expected that in 2017 almost three quarters of all Internet traffic will be in video format, and a significant portion of videos will be on mobile devices. Also, the video has new formats: 360 ° and VR (virtual reality). Last year, our global network Ketchum launched a separate direction for creating virtual reality content for the agency's clients. ARKA – How seriously the demands and expectations of the consumers have changed against the background of developing communications, and where doe  the future of communications lie? Y. Kondrasheva - The consumer, especially the young, live by the principle of "here and now". They want instant access to the product, so brands build a Buy Now button into their videos and create bots in online stores that help make the right choice. Consumers expect that the content will not only convey information, but will involve them in a dialogue and cause emotions. So the future, I think, is precisely is in the involvement and multilateral communication. ARKA - What tools can help in the short-term promotion of products? Y. Kondrasheva - It can be a bright, non-standard event with the participation of opinion leaders or the provision of a new product for testing to influential bloggers and journalists. But generally PR rarely gives a momentary effect; it's still a long-term investment. -0- 18:54 18.05.2017 Yerevan, PR summit, Kondrashova Comments (0)   <a href="http://ads.adfox.ru/164172/goDefaultLink?pp=g&amp;ps=nlu&amp;p2=emoa&amp;" target="_blank"><img src="http://ads.adfox.ru/164172/getDefaultImage?pp=g&amp;ps=nlu&amp;p2=emoa" border="0" alt=""></a> « May 2017    January February March April May    2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 ] Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31         Main news Today 10:52 Armenia’s Gegharkunik province governor resigns for parliamentary activity 10:40 OSCE Minsk Group co-chairs confirm that tension escalation in Karabakh triggered by Azerbaijani side Yesterday 19:07 Karen Karapetyan reappointed as Armenian prime minister Most read 12/05 Egypt’s AIR CAIRO embarks on flights from Hurghada and Sharm ... 12/05 Jewelers from Armenia, Russia, Turkey, USA, Belarus and Lebanon showcasing their products at Yerevan Show exhibition 12/05 Armenia ranked 84th among 136 countries in terms of tourism development by the travel & tourism competitiveness report 2017 12/05 AAS Industria Company to invest AMD 115 million in production of heat-sensitive paper and labels in Armenia AMI "Novosti-Armenia" Main sections: · Politics · Economy · Business · Society · Tourism · Technology · Sport · Incidents · In the world · Analytics · Interview · Announcements · ARKA-15 · Classified · Photoreports · Videoreports · All news Agency About agency Jobs Advertisement ©1996-2017 ARKA All rights reserved.

The event celebrates the art, architecture and history of the Arroyo Seco area, found in the six unique history-based museums that preserve and perpetuate early Los Angeles life. Featured in the Museums of the Arroyo Day are the Gamble House and the Pasadena Museum of History in Pasadena , and the Lummis Home and Garden, Heritage Square, the Los Angeles Police Museum and The Autry’s Southwest Museum Mt. Washington campus in Los Angeles. All of these museums are conveniently located off of the 210 and 110 freeways, and anyone can visit one or all of the museums during the day at no charge, although the organizers advise visitors to pace themselves and leisurely visit at least three of the museums between noon and 5 p.m. The last entrance will be at 4 p.m. The Gamble House, built in 1908, is the most complete and best-preserved example of the work of renowned Pasadena architects Charles and Henry Greene. Now an internationally recognized National Historical Landmark, the Gamble House was built in the style of the American arts and crafts movement for David and Mary Gamble of the Procter and Gamble Company. The architects worked closely with the Gambles in the design of the house, incorporating specific design elements to complement art pieces belonging to the family. The Gamble House is at 4 Westmoreland Place in Pasadena. At the Pasadena Museum of History, visitors can view current exhibits such as Art in the Street: 25 Years of the Pasadena Chalk Festival, and The Art of Getting There: Railroad Inspired Artistry, exploring how railroads have inspired artists since their introduction. The Pasadena Museum of History is at 470 W. Walnut Street in Pasadena . The Lummis Home and Garden, at 200 E. Avenue 43 in Los Angeles, is a rustic American craftsman home built by Charles Fletcher Lummis in the late 19th century. It’s also known as “El Alisal,” the alder grove. The house is 4,000 square feet and took 13 years to build. Heritage Square, established in 1969, is a living history museum that tells the story of the development of Southern California – from its earliest days as a small pueblo to the bustling metropolis that over three million call home today. Through guided tours of nine historic structures and an ever-changing array of exhibits and special events, Heritage Square transports guests back in time to an era when electricity was a novelty, a trip to the beach was often a full-weekend activity, and manners were distinctly different from those of today. Heritage Square is at 3800 Homers Street in Los Angeles. The Los Angeles Police Museum, at 6045 York Boulevard, Highland Park in Los Angeles, was opened in 2001 and museum displays the rich history of the LAPD from its 1869 beginnings. The museum was salvaged and restored to its original Renaissance Revival style and is a registered National Historic landmark. The Autry’s Southwest Museum Mt. Washington campus, located at 234 Museum Drive in Los Angeles, was constructed in 1914 and is the site of the ongoing conservation initiative of the Southwest Museum of the American Indian Collection, one of the largest and most significant collections of Native American materials in the United States. The museum is open and free every Saturday, 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. One of the ongoing exhibitions is Four Centuries of Pueblo Pottery, featuring rare ceramics made by the Pueblo peoples of Arizona and New Mexico. A variety of transportation options are available for visitors to MOTA Day – driving, taking the Gold Line, riding your bike, or simply walking through the museums. MOTA Day will also have two free shuttle loops, with service between the Gamble House/Pasadena Museum of History and Los Angeles Police Historical Museum – the Pasadena route; and between the Los Angeles Police Historical Museum hooking up with Lummis Home and the Southwest – the Highland Park route. Transport advice and shuttle details can be accessed and downloaded from www.mota.dreamhosters.com/how-to-get-to-mota-day. For complete details about MOTA Day, visit www.MuseumsOfTheArroyo.com.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: 3 Dividend Stocks for Thrifty Investors Are you an income investor looking for a bargain? Here's why you should check out Dunkin' Brands Group, 8point3 Energy Partners, and Procter & Gamble. Brian Feroldi, Travis Hoium, and Demitrios Kalogeropoulos (TMFTypeoh) May 18, 2017 at 9:16AM In the recent market environment, it's been harder and harder for income investors to find attractive stocks to buy. However, if you are willing to turn over enough rocks, there are almost always a few stocks that can be purchased on the cheap. Knowing that, we asked a team of Fools to highlight a dividend stock that they think is a great choice for an investor who likes a bargain. Here's why they picked Dunkin' Brands Group (NASDAQ:DNKN), 8point3 Energy Partners (NASDAQ:CAFD), and Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG). Image source: Getty Images. Plenty of room left for expansion Brian Feroldi (Dunkin' Brands Group): Thrifty investors know that they can save a bundle over the long term by getting their caffeine fix at home. However, that fact doesn't stop millions of people from buying their morning breakfast and cup of joe from their local Dunkin' Donuts anyway. With more than 12,000 stores in operation, Dunkin' Brands has done a fabulous job at making its products easy to find and buy. When combined with the company's knack for marketing and branding, this has made Dunkin' Brands a company that many people simply cannot live without. That dependence has worked out wonderfully for investors. The strength of the Dunkin' Donuts and Baskin-Robbins brand names continues to compel franchisees to open more stores. In turn, Dunkin' Brands has benefited from an ever-increasing flow of high-margin royalty and rental-income payments. Management has then used that growing profit stream to reward investors with regular stock buybacks and a rising dividend payment.  Given the company's ubiquity in some parts of the U.S., you might be tempted to assume that Dunkin' Brands' opportunity for expansion is quite limited. I thought so too until I took a closer look at the numbers. I then realized that the company's opporunity for growth is still massive, even right here in the U.S. While there are more than 4,000 stores in the company's "core" northeastern market, there are only 454 stores up and running in the company's west region. That area includes several heavily populated states such as California, Texas, and Washington, which suggests that there is ample room left for future store growth. Add in the company's skill at growing same-store sales and buying back stock, and market watchers predict that Dunkin' Brands' bottom line will expand at more than 12% annually over the next five years. That's an attractive growth rate for a company that offers up a dividend yield of 2.3% and is trading around 21 times forward earnings.  Renewable energy's forgotten dividend Travis Hoium (8point3 Energy Partners): Thrifty investors looking for cheap stocks and a consistent business should take a look at 8point3 Energy Partners. The solar energy yieldco owns solar power plants that have long-term contracts, often over 20 years, to sell energy to utilities at fixed prices and uses its cash flow to pay out a hefty dividend.  The stock has been beaten up lately because First Solar announced its intention to sell its stake in 8point3 Energy Partners as it shifts business strategies. But that doesn't take away from the underlying value of the existing assets. And with a 7.7% dividend yield, the stock would be a great long-term investment for the dividend alone, and if a buyout takes place, there could be a short-term premium paid.  Yieldcos have been out of style for most of the past year and 8point3 Energy Partners has struggled on the market as a result. But the contracted cash flow the company has over the next 20 years should translate to a solid dividend, with the potential for further dividend growth or even a buyout in the future. That's what makes 8point3 a great dividend stock for thrifty investors. A frugal company that sells premium products Demitri Kalogeropoulos (Procter & Gamble): Most consumer goods companies are focused on cutting costs these days as their industry plugs along at near-zero growth. But Procter & Gamble has taken that frugal strategy to heights that could make it an appealing option for thrifty investors. In the past five years, the Dividend Aristocrat has sliced over $7 billion from its cost of goods sold and is targeting a further $10 billion of cuts ahead. PG Cost of Goods Sold (TTM) data by YCharts. The changes are supporting market-thumping profitability. In fact, P&G's 21% operating margin puts it well ahead of nearly all its consumer-focused peers. Now that the company finally has the portfolio of products that it wants -- one that's far simpler, easier to manage, and more profitable -- shareholders are looking for P&G to return to market-share gains after two straight years of disappointing declines in key brands like Gillette. When it began its mission to remove 100 brands from the portfolio, after all, management said the initiative would result in roughly 1% faster organic growth and an extra percentage point of profitability. Sure, that rebound is being complicated by the weak selling environment that has everyone in the industry cutting prices in hopes of keeping sales volumes rising. But P&G still aims to grow at nearly double its 2016 pace this year. Its improving profit picture, meanwhile, helped fund a 3% dividend increase that keeps its annual yield comfortably above 3%.

May 18, 2017 08:30 ET Dove's Focus on Real Beauty Sparks Real Consumer Conversations -- Both in Real Life as Well as Online Engagement Labs TotalSocial® Rankings Reveal Top Personal Care and Beauty Brands based on Word of Mouth Conversations and Social Media NEW YORK, NY --(Marketwired - May 18, 2017) - When it comes to getting people to talk about their brand, Dove is staying fresh. In a new, first-of-its-kind analysis of combined offline and online consumer conversations, Engagement Labs identified Dove as the number one TotalSocial® personal care and beauty brand among top U.S. performers in the category. The rankings are based on Engagement Labs' proprietary TotalSocial data, which continuously measures the most important drivers of brand performance with respect to social media and word of mouth conversations. Yet for a category that invests heavily in online marketing strategies, more conversations take place away from digital screen. In fact, the personal care and beauty brand category has the highest offline scores among all of the 17 sectors tracked by TotalSocial, while the category's online scores are about average. While Dove takes the lead as the top personal care and beauty brand on TotalSocial, several of its peers also show strong performances in both categories -- on- and offline -- including Bath & Body Works, Sephora, Neutrogena, Nivea, and L'Oréal. These brands have managed to strike up a meaningful conversation online as well as offline. "Dove is a standout because it performs well both offline and online. The brand has sustained its marketing success over the years through promoting positive self-image and highlighting issues surrounding the media's depiction of women, which spark conversations," says Ed Keller, CEO of Engagement Labs. "Dove's campaigns are larger than beauty tips and tutorials, which is why the brand has been so successful." Bath & Body Works, the number two TotalSocial personal care and beauty brand, uses its retail stores to build an emotional connection to its customers. Designed to evoke pleasant memories from the past -- such as the scent of a holiday candle or a favorite fragrance -- the stores are designed to feel like home. In addition, the brand has carefully cultivated relationships with in-store customers, which in turn leads to offline conversation. P&G's Gillette, which has faced serious challenges to their business model from competitors like Unilever's Dollar Shave Club in recent years, is the only male personal care and beauty product to make the top ten. To hold onto its 60 percent share of the $15 billion market, P&G has invested in both online and offline marketing and advertising strategies, including a web-based shave club and advertising partnerships with major movie franchises. "What sets personal care and beauty brands apart from brands in other categories is that they are in a space where consumers rely heavily on recommendations and advice as skin and beauty care is extremely important," notes Keller. "As marketers, brands in this category need to appreciate that and continuously strive for ways to remain part of those conversations, as well as to make even more effective use of social media as so many brands in the category now do. However, the data clearly shows that a focus on social media at the expense of word of mouth is at odds with how consumers behave today and thus an integrated approach is essential. The success of brands such as Dove and Gillette underscores just how important it is to capitalize fully on consumer conversations."

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 18 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman New Survey Reveals 7 In 10 Brits Feel Uneasy About Going To The Dentist – But We Can Help Prevent This! LONDON–(BUSINESS WIRE)–One of the best ways to maintain a healthy smile is through regular visits to a dental professional; however, two thirds of us could feel better about this experience. A survey fielded in partnership with the Oral Health Foundation for National Smile Month (15 May to 15 June, 2017) reveals that 67% of British adults are apprehensive about visiting a dental professional1. Of note, 33% feel anxious about the discomfort of the treatment2, and 26% worry about the cost of the treatment2. Instead of being nervous, there are a few simple steps you can take at home in order to improve your next dental check-up and feel better about your oral health. “Preventing oral care problems is definitely better than treating them. By listening to your dentist and using products they recommend, like the Oral-B Pro-Expert toothpaste, you can be sure to have long-lasting healthier gums and teeth,” said Dr. Uchenna Okoye, Oral-B Smile Director. Don’t procrastinate – take better care of your teeth today According to the new survey, more than a quarter (28%) of us would attempt to fix or improve our oral health just days before a visit to the dentist1. The best way to get ahead is to make sure you brush like your dental professional recommends: twice every day for two minutes each time with a good fluoride toothpaste2. Eat “mouth friendly” foods Avoid foods high in sugar and acid such as fizzy drinks, fruit juices and sweets to help prevent weakened enamel and tooth decay. Both issues are common in the UK, affecting 50%3 and 30%4 of the population, respectively, and can lead to more serious oral health issues, such as extreme sensitivity resulting from weakened enamel5, and gum disease and cavities resulting from tooth decay2. Switch to Oral-B Pro-Expert toothpaste – the #1 toothpaste used by UK dentists themselves6 Oral-B Pro-Expert is clinically proven to strengthen teeth and give you a healthier mouth starting from day one7. It also helps prevent against any of the key eight areas dentists check most: Cavities Gum problems Plaque build-up on teeth Tooth sensitivity Tartar build up on teeth Stains on teeth Bad breath Enamel erosion A Perfect Pair: Oral-B Pro-Expert & Oral-B GENIUS 9000 electric toothbrush The Oral-B GENIUS 9000 electric toothbrush features ground-breaking Position Detection Technology that combines cutting-edge motion sensor technology located in the brush and video recognition to track areas that are being brushed, so you’ll never miss a zone. Used together, Oral-B GENIUS 9000 electric toothbrush and Oral-B Pro-Expert toothpaste set a new standard for your teeth and gums: a professionally guided brushing routine with the #1 toothpaste used by UK dentists themselves6. Oral-B Pro-Expert is available in five variants to meet a wide range of consumer preferences: Professional Protection, Deep Clean, Healthy White, Healthy Fresh and Strong Teeth. For more information please visit http://www.oralb.co.uk/. There is no reason to worry about visiting your dental professional; with Oral-B you can start improving your dental check-ups from today. Oral-B is a proud, platinum sponsor of National Smile Month and has been since 2008. National Smile Month is the UK’s largest and longest-running oral health campaign.

Ralph Lauren tapped a beauty executive to lead his company after his previous chief executive left earlier this month. Patrice Louvet, a Procter & Gamble veteran who had most recently headed up that company’s global beauty business, was named chief executive and president of Ralph Lauren, the company said Wednesday. Louvet will assume his new position on July 17. “Finding the right partner to work with me to take us forward in our evolution has been my primary focus,” Lauren, 77, who will continue in his role as executive chairman and chief creative officer, said in a statement. It’s not unusual for a brand under financial pressure to bring in an outsider, said Marshal Cohen, chief industry analyst at the NPD Group. However, it’s possible Ralph Lauren is positioning itself to be bought, Cohen noted. Stefan Larsson, a fast-fashion veteran, stepped down as CEO. Ralph Lauren shares dipped 1.6 percent on Wednesday, to $72.75.

Check These Traditional Safety Investments Chris Dier-Scalise , Benzinga Staff Writer   {{following ? "Following" : "Follow"}} May 18, 2017 5:30pm   Comments Share: Regardless of your political or social leanings, 2016 was a year of unexpected developments in the world of geopolitics. The decision on the part of British voters to leave the European Union as well as the election victory of Donald Trump were two high-impact instances of the unanticipated running roughshod over analyst predictions. However, other dramatic developments throughout the world, such as the impeachment of South Korean President Park Geun-hye, the rise of nationalist, protectionist ideology in Europe, America, and Asia, as well as the revelation of Russia’s involvement in influencing America’s presidential election, all fostered a contentious world stage through much of the year. 2017 has proceeded with little positive change in the geopolitical forecast. Anxieties have mounted in the Pacific due to increased military action from both North Korea and the United States. Strife has pervaded the Middle Eastern theater due to the ongoing Syrian conflict, in addition to the attempt by military forces to retake ISIS-controlled Mosul, Afghanistan. This has in turn added to the crisis-level outflow of refugees from the region throughout Eurasia at a time when immigrants are increasingly treated with suspicion and outright derision. There is also President Trump’s use of the largest non-nuclear explosive device in a surprise bombing in Syria early in April. Though the show of force delighted some, it also left many wondering whether he had a clear foreign policy to guide the country through the seemingly dark times ahead. While all of this might have you feeling understandably anxious, you may take some solace in the fact that the stock market has largely been able to brush off ALL of these developments without flinching. In fact, the DOW and S&P, as well as many other indices and individual equities, continue to find record highs. While many analysts have long called a top to the bull market, and many others have claimed the market is overvalued, there has yet to be a sustained major correction. If that doesn’t allay your concerns, and you have some investment assets you are thinking about moving into alternative instruments or more defensive securities, there are a few avenues that investors have historically used in times of uncertainty that you may want to consider. If you are worried enough to shift your portfolio, but not enough to take your money completely out of the still growing the equities market, consider the consumer staples sector. Following the 2008 financial crisis, stocks like Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG) and Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE: CL) showed steady resilience in reclaiming much of their valuation in the months following an initial correction. Compared to the rest of the equities market, this sector remains defensive. Similarly, stocks with consistent dividend yields have also served investors as a safety measure by padding their portfolios with reliable income. Telecom giants like AT&T Inc. (NYSE: T) and Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE: VZ), which both offer a nearly 5% annual dividend yield (at the time of this writing). Utilities like Brookfield Renewable Partners LP (NYSE: BEP) and Just Energy Group Inc (NYSE: JE), which currently have a yield over 6%, have traditionally been common sectors for dividend payouts. However, dividend returns rely on a company’s sustained revenue and growth, and high dividend offerings can act as a value trap if a company does not have fundamental strength to continue distributions. These concerns are especially relevant if lean times are ahead. Providing greater insurance against risk, government-backed investments like Treasury notes and bonds have served as the fallback for long-term investors in times of downturn or slow growth. Government debt has the benefit of reliable semi-annual returns in interest payments and can sometimes retain high value if they were purchased in a higher interest rate environment, although their resale value drops as interest rates rise. Due to a prolonged trend of economic deflation that has still not abated, government bonds have not regained much of their value following the 2008 crisis. Prior to the crash, the rate on 30-year treasury note yields were steadily in the range of 4.2%. Compare that to the most recent auction yields of 30-year notes in April of 2017 where rates have failed to break 3%. This is mainly due to a surplus of notes, which have been unattractive investments as the market has experienced steady recovery since 2010. While the low price is a boon for value-seekers, the fact that that yields have remained low despite recent growth trends have diminished the value and weakened the defensive viability of debt securities. Finally, money market accounts may be your best option in finding recourse from high risk and unexpected global financial events. MMA’s are FDIC-backed deposit accounts that offer higher interest rate returns than traditional savings accounts. While your investments are still subject to dollar value trends, as with treasury bonds, there is less risk of opportunity loss if rates begin to rise. While money market funds are often grouped together with MMA’s as similar safety investment instruments, their actual risk tolerance is much lower. Money market funds are privately managed mutual funds and are therefore not guaranteed under the FDIC. And while money market funds invest in short-term, high-quality, liquid corporate debt securities, they are still at risk if the bond issuers become suddenly insolvent as occurred in 2008.

Facebook Pinterest Getty Images Facebook Twitter Pinterest Email May 18, 2017 By Alyse Whitney There are two schools of dishwashing thought: filling a sink with soapy water, or washing each dish individually with a soapy sponge. At Bon Appétit, we do a little bit of both, but we were recently introduced to a third method that may change your whole after-dinner routine. Test kitchen assistant Gaby Melian revealed that her mother used to dilute Palmolive dish soap by keeping about ⅓ of the concentrated soap and filling the rest of the bottle with water. You know how sometimes when you're almost out of soap you add some water to stretch it a few more days until you go to the store? It's like that, but when you first buy a bottle so it lasts three times as long. Gaby does this in the BA test kitchen and at home with a variety of different brands. Some bottles say to dilute on the back when you're adding soap to a sink, but they don't suggest re-bottling it in diluted form. (Gaby uses a squirt bottle to store hers.) Gaby with her squirt bottle of diluted soap. But is this soap as effective as the concentrated stuff? Dawn dish soap's official stance is no. "We do not recommend diluting your bottle of soap. Dawn Ultra is one of the most concentrated handwashing liquids on the market, which already allows consumers to do more dishes with less," Morgan Brashear, official Dawn Scientist for Procter & Gamble, wrote in an email to Bon Appétit. One 21-ounce bottle can allegedly wash more than 5,000 plates. However, if you wanted to fill up your sink with soapy water, Dawn will "continue to fight grease no matter how concentrated it is." And fun fact: 65 percent of Dawn's consumers wash each plate individually, while 35 percent fill up the sink with sudsy water. Some soaps aren't as concentrated as Dawn, though, so we asked plant-based houseware company method if green cleaners could stand up to dilution. Head Green Chef Akemi Ooka (who formulates all of method's products) said yes, and suggested using 1 Tbsp. of dish soap to 1-1.5 quarts of very hot water. Using method's pump, that's about "a squirt per cup of water." Ooka added that "leaving highly diluted dish soap in a separate bottle over time can lead to microbial growth," so it's best to dilute in the sink rather than in your pump. Overall, she said, it's the temperature of your water that matters most to kill bacteria—that's what helps remove grime from dishes when it activates the soap. Soap companies prefer that you don’t dilute the whole bottle, but diluting in the sink is fine. Here at the BA test kitchen, we’re Team Dilute, but you do you. The third—and arguably best—option? Just pass off duties to whomever you're cooking for. You deserve a break. You know what makes washing dishes better? These gloves: If You Hate Washing Dishes, These Are the Gloves for You We'll take anything that makes our dishwashing experience better. These gloves are a great start.

The 30-scrip Sensex hit a fresh lifetime high of 30,692. Original story: Stock markets are likely to open with gains on Friday, reversing Thursday losses, on the back of two positive triggers: the finalisation of tax rates for 1,211 items by the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council on Thursday and the International Court of Justice's (ICJ) order to halt execution of former Indian naval officer Kulbhushan Jadhav by Pakistan. While the latter is a diplomatic victory for the Modi government and has an emotional value, the fitment of rates to most goods and services by the GST Council clears a lot of uncertainty.  Read: Big win for India, ICJ says Pakistan should not hang Kulbhushan Jadhav before final verdict On the first day of its 14th meeting in Srinagar, the GST Council decided to exempt food items such as wheat, cereals and milk from GST while fixing the rate at 28 percent for cars, regrigerators and air-conditioners.  "Nearly 81 per cent of the items will fall under below-18 percent GST rate slabs and only 19 percent of the goods will be taxed above 18 percent," Revenue Secretary Hasmukh Adhia said. Daily use items such as soaps, hair oil and toothpaste will attract 18 percent as against the current 22-24 percent while capital goods and industrial intermediaries will attract 18 percent in comparison to the existing 28 percent, according to the Mint. This is likely to lift share prices of FMCG stocks such as Hindustan Unilever Ltd., Marico, Dabur and P&G.  Logistics stocks such as Allcargo Logistics, Snowman Logistics, Gati are likely to gain after the significant movement in the rollout of the GST from July 1. The 28 percent levy on cars should also be seen as a big positive since it is on expected lines and therefore lead to gains in share prices of Maruti Suzuki, Tata Motors and Mahindra. The rate for the most-awaited commodity, gold, will be decided on Friday. In other news, State Bank of India (SBI) will be declaring its Q4 and FY2017 results. On Thursday, the Sensex closed 224 points (0.73 percent) down at 30,434. Top losers were Tata Motors and Axis Bank while IT stocks Wipro, TCS and Infosys ended with gains after a series of losses in the past few sessions over layoff reports.  Foreign portfolio investors were net sellers of Indian equities worth Rs 361 crore, according to provisional data published by the National Stock Exchange.

Habito - @inquirerdotnet Philippine Daily Inquirer / 12:28 AM May 19, 2017 Stories of retailers in the United States filing for bankruptcy have been in the news fairly often in recent years. Erstwhile big names like Macy’s and Marks & Spencer are finding themselves having difficulties abroad, particularly in more advanced economies. The story here in the Philippines for these companies, and for the malling and retail business in general, is still quite different, but the lessons learned from the experience of these companies elsewhere are well worth noting. It’s a fact that the average life span of big businesses has been falling. This was the finding of a 2012 study on Standard & Poor’s top 500 companies by Innosight, a consulting firm on business strategy and innovation: From 61 years in 1958, the average life span of S&P 500 companies fell to 25 years in 1980, and further down to 18 years in 2012. The S&P 500 lists large companies that span the range of US industries. The observed trend may be short-term or just part of the evolution of business models, but company closures have been real and have real impact. A major factor in reduced company longevity is technological disruption, which has become the norm. While businesses once had to face technological turnovers every so many years, companies now face the threat of disruption nearly every day. In a 2016 survey by Dell Technologies, 78 percent of companies saw digital startups as a threat; in the Asia-Pacific region, the number is slightly higher at 83 percent. A firm never knows when the next big innovation will turn its world upside down. The disruption need not even be something inherent to the industry. Social media has disrupted the way companies create and protect their brand and reputation. United Airlines took a major hit from the bad publicity it got for bumping off a single passenger. Uber is also in hot water for indiscretion by its drivers. While issues like these would have been silenced with payoffs and swept under the rug 10 years ago, not anymore. Social media has made a great difference. ADVERTISEMENT We can learn from long-surviving companies that remain thriving in today’s business environment. A notable example is Procter & Gamble, which fosters a culture of innovation that tries to develop products that will change the lives of its customers. It had done that with Pampers, with Colgate-Palmolive, and with Tide, among others. P&G’s strategy is illustrated by its success story with Gillette razors in India. It developed a razor that could be easily cleaned without running water, and cheap enough for most Indian men to afford. The product embodied an understanding of the needs of its target market. Being a much older company with a significant innovation budget, P&G could well handle the cost of the innovation cycle. Google has a similar innovation-driven culture. Its story is more about how it encourages its people to innovate. Hiring people who already buy into the company’s mission and vision, allowing them freedom to work in ways that they are most productive, and eliminating bureaucracy and empowering staff are only some of the ways Google creates a corporate brand that looks like it will be around for the long haul. Innovation does not even need to be a new product. BDO Unibank changed banking in the Philippines by offering longer hours and weekend banking. Mang Inasal came up with Unli Rice. In this economy, it’s wise to make sure the company stays relevant, as exemplified by CDR King, which began with now nearly-extinct CDs, but is still very much around, selling almost everything from glitters to electronic bikes. It has kept abreast of the needs of its customers. Businesses now need to be more conscious of their market because in the sea of the internet, the creative kick-starter solution or cheaper Lazada or Alibaba alternative to customer needs is just a google away. The days of sweeping the needs of customers under the rug for profit are numbered. Not only are there alternatives all over just waiting to fill the gaps, unaddressed customer needs also come under close scrutiny. Perhaps the key to a lasting company is an old lesson relearned: Customer is King. cielito.habito@gmail.com Subscribe to INQUIRER PLUS to get access to The Philippine Daily Inquirer & other 70+ titles, share up to 5 gadgets, listen to the news, download as early as 4am & share articles on social media.

At the SALT conference in Las Vegas today, one manager defended Apple, Alphabet and Facebook. By Ben Levisohn May 17, 2017 9:25 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large One of the big themes discussed here at SALT has been the impact of technology--digitization, automation, and the like--on both the economy and on investments. It was defended by Alphabet (GOOGL) Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt, and mentioned in almost every panel today. Illustration: Getty Images In a panel earlier today, Mark Asset Management's Morris Mark called the cell phone "the single most important device" for many people, and defended the valuations of big tech companies, including Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB), and yes, Alphabet. He noted that the companies are growing at double-digit rates, and that their valuations are no worse than many slower growing big caps, including Procter & Gamble (PG) and Coca-Cola (KO). Apple trades at 16.1 times times current-year earnings, while Facebook trades at 27.6 times, and Alphabet at 27.3 times. Procter & Gamble, meanwhile, trades at 22.6 times, and Coca-Cola trades at 22.9 times. Is that cheap enough for you?

"Following" : "Follow"}} May 18, 2017 7:43am   Comments Share: Related RL A Peek Into The Markets: U.S. Stock Futures Down Ahead Of Wal-Mart Earnings 10 Stocks To Watch For May 18, 2017 Dillard's Less Affected by Internet Than Competing Retail (GuruFocus) Ralph Lauren Corp (NYSE: RL)'s stock hit a new multi-year low of $71.51 on Wednesday and is now down nearly 20 percent since the start of 2017 — and perhaps even more concerning, down 55 percent over the past five years. The company on Thursday is projected to report quarterly earnings at $0.78 per share on revenue of $1.56 billion. Ralph Lauren's problems extend beyond the overall hurt felt by nearly all apparel makers and retailers. Behind the scenes, ex-CEO Stefan Larsson clashed with the company's namesake founder, Ralph Lauren. Prior reports suggested that Larsson, a former top executive at H&M and Old Navy, kicked off some of the strategies that were more appropriate for budget retailers and not for a high-end brand. Larsson said in early February that he and the company decided to mutually part ways, and a replacement was announced Wednesday. Ralph Lauren named Patrice Louvet as CEO, effective on July 17. Louvet, a native of France, most recently ran Procter & Gamble Co (NYSE: PG)'s global beauty business, which saw $11.5 billion in annual sales at its peak. Cramer: 'Very Accomplished' CEO Commenting on Ralph Lauren's new CEO, CNBC's Jim Cramer said during Wednesday's "Squawk on the Street" segment that Louvet is a "highly respected" and "very accomplished" executive who "really knows how to run an operation." Cramer also believes that Louvet is the right executive for consumers to regain trust in the high-end brand. Perhaps more important, Louvet won't be "butting heads" with Lauren, who will continue playing a key role at the business. See Also: 2 Decades After Their IPOs, Where Are These Companies Now? Salary?

Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 index slid 1.4 percent and South Korea’s Kospi lost 0.4 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng shed 0.3 percent and the Shanghai Composite index in mainland China dipped 0.4 percent. Benchmarks in Taiwan, New Zealand and most of Southeast Asia also lost ground. Download our Expert Edition e-book, Cyber: Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation. Advertisement On Wall Street, major U.S. benchmarks suffered big losses. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index had its largest drop since September, sliding 1.8 percent to 2,357.03. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 1.8 percent to 20,606.93.

THE DAY AHEAD Major business and economic events scheduled for Thursday WASHINGTON (AP) — The Labor Department reports Thursday on the number of people who applied for unemployment benefits last week. Freddie Mac reports on this week’s average U.S. mortgage rates. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. reports quarterly financial results before the market opens. Wal-Mart may tout its latest online shopping spree, as it’s expected to report another round of strong quarterly results. Check out Federal News Radio's latest podcasts. JAPAN-ECONOMY Japan economy expands at 2.2 percent annual pace in Jan-Mar TOKYO (AP) — Japan reports that its economy grew at a faster-than-expected 2.2 percent annual pace in January-March. Economists had forecast a strong expansion in the first quarter, helped by a recovery in exports and consumer spending. But most estimates had not topped 2 percent. The figures released Thursday are preliminary and likely to be revised. The economy grew at a 1.2 percent pace in the last quarter of 2016. Recent data suggest a weakening of corporate spending on factory equipment that may pull growth lower in the current quarter. On a quarterly basis, the economy expanded 0.5 percent. AUSTRALIA-FAIRFAX MEDIA 2 US private equity firms bid for Australia newspaper empire (Note: All monetary figures are in American dollars) CANBERRA, Australia (AP) — Australia’s second-largest newspaper empire, Fairfax Media, announced Thursday that it has received rival takeover offers from two U.S. private equity investment firms. The Sydney-based multimedia company said a non-binding indicative offer was received Wednesday from San Francisco-based Hellman & Friedman at a price of between $0.9138 and $0.9325 per share. That offer values Fairfax at between $2.10 billion and $2.14 billion. TPG Group, also based in San Francisco, made an improved offer of $0.8952 per share on Monday that values the Australian company at $2.06 billion. TRUMP-DUBAI Donald Trump Jr., Dubai business partner discuss ‘new ideas’ DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Donald Trump Jr. traveled to Dubai and met a billionaire business partner in the city-state. They discussed “new ideas” as the Emirati’s real estate firm still lists possible plans for future joint projects while Trump’s father is in the White House. The Trump Organization has said it won’t make new foreign deals while Donald Trump serves as America’s 45th president. That didn’t affect the Trump International Golf Club in Dubai’s opening in February, while a previously planned Trump-branded golf course designed by Tiger Woods is still being built nearby. Both projects are being built by Dubai’s DAMAC Properties, owned by Emirati billionaire Hussain Sajwani. His company has paid the Trump Organization’s subsidiaries between $1 million to $5 million for the projects, according to a U.S. Federal Election Committee report submitted in May. GOOGLE SHOWCASE Google unveils latest tech tricks as computers get smarter MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. (AP) — Google’s computer programs are gaining a better understanding of the world. And now it wants them to handle more of the decision-making for the billions of people who use its services. CEO Sundar Pichai and other top executives brought Google’s audacious ambition into sharper focus Wednesday at an annual conference in Mountain View, California, attended by more than 7,000 developers. Among other things, Google unveiled new ways for its massive network of computers to identify images, as well as recommend, share, and organize photos. It also is launching an attempt to make its voice-controlled digital assistant more proactive and visual while expanding its audience to Apple’s iPhone, where it will try to outwit an older peer, Siri. EARNS-CISCO SYSTEMS Cisco Systems announces 1,100 more layoffs SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) — Cisco Systems Inc. said Wednesday that it is laying off 1,100 more workers, deepening job losses at the internet gear maker battling declining revenue. The new round of layoffs comes on top of the 5,500 jobs Cisco announced it was cutting in August. That amounted to about 7 percent of its workforce at the time. Cisco sells routers, switches, software and services business and has seen its business hurt as more of its corporate customers rely on remote data centers for their computing needs instead of online networks maintained on their own premises. The company based in San Jose, California, on Wednesday reported revenue of $11.94 billion for its fiscal third quarter that ended in April. That was down from $12 billion a year earlier. It said it expects its revenue to decline 4 to 6 percent in the quarter ending in July compared to the same 2016 period. TARGET-RESULTS Target locked in game of shipping tag with Wal-Mart, Amazon NEW YORK (AP) — Target, Wal-Mart and Amazon are engaged in a game of shipping tag, each trying to adjust their free threshold and other shipping strategies to a level that can lure shoppers away from one of the other. Minneapolis-based Target has the furthest to go as it tries to put itself in better competition with Amazon, the undisputed online leader, and Wal-Mart, which has been buying online startups to beef up its own operations. Target has announced plans to put more money into both its online operations and its stores, and saw it online sales rise 22 percent for the first quarter. That was a slowdown from 34 percent in the fourth quarter, though. CHOBANI-ALEX JONES-RETRACTION In reversal, radio host Alex Jones apologizes to Chobani BOISE, Idaho (AP) — Right-wing radio host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones says he has settled a lawsuit filed by Greek yogurt giant Chobani, reversing course from previous claims that he would never back down in the defamation case. Jones read a brief statement at the end of his radio show Wednesday saying he had retracted previous stories and tweets about Chobani. Chobani had argued in its lawsuit that Jones and his InfoWars website posted fabricated stories earlier this month that linked Chobani owner Hamdi Ulukaya and the company to a sexual assault case involving refugee children. The company filed the lawsuit in Idaho District Court in Twin Falls, where it operates the largest yogurt plant in the world. Jones added that he regretted mischaracterizing Chobani, its employees and the people of Twin Falls. STOLEN BEEHIVES Bee industry buzzing: Stolen hives recovered in California FRESNO, Calif. (AP) — The bee industry is buzzing over the arrest of a man accused of stealing thousands of hives worth nearly $1 million from California’s almond orchards in one of the biggest such thefts on record. The case has thrown a spotlight on a business many city slickers probably never knew existed: Beekeepers in the U.S. move their colonies around the country by truck and rent them out to farmers to pollinate their flowering crops. In California, which relies on bees brought in from such places as Missouri, Montana and North Dakota to produce more almonds than any other place in the world, hives began to vanish overnight across several counties three years ago. RALPH LAUREN-CEO Ralph Lauren names Procter & Gamble executive as CEO NEW YORK (AP) — Ralph Lauren Corp. has tapped Procter & Gamble beauty executive Patrice Louvet as its next CEO as the preppy fashion brand seeks to turn its business around. The company known for its polo shirts and pony logo said Wednesday that Louvet will start in July. He will replace Stefan Larsson, who announced in February that he would leave the New York-based company after less than two years in the job. Larsson was the first person other than company founder Ralph Lauren to hold the title. The two clashed over creative control, though Lauren said the decision to part was mutual. Shares of Ralph Lauren slipped $1.19 to close Wednesday at $72.75. They are down 19 percent so far this year. LAVAR BALL-SHOE MONEY LaVar Ball ups shoe deal asking price to $3 billion UNDATED (AP) — LaVar Ball has upped the ante. The outspoken father of former UCLA star Lonzo Ball said Wednesday on Fox Sport 1’s “The Herd with Colin Cowherd” that it will now cost a shoe company $3 billion to make a deal with his Big Baller Brand.

Dreft® Unveils New Dreft purtouch™ - A 65% Plant-Based Hypoallergenic Baby Detergent (Photo: Business Wire) Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail Dreft® Unveils New Dreft purtouch™ - A 65% Plant-Based Hypoallergenic Baby Detergent (Photo: Business Wire) Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail May 18, 2017 09:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time CINCINNATI--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dreft®, the No. 1 pediatrician-recommended baby detergent, has announced its newest product offering, Dreft purtouch™, a 65% plant-based baby detergent that is hypoallergenic and made with naturally-derived ingredients. Dreft purtouch has a formula that is free of dyes, chlorine, phosphates, ethanolamine and optical brighteners and is made with 100% renewable wind power electricity at a zero manufacturing waste to landfill site. The introduction of Dreft purtouch comes at a time when new and expectant parents are making careful choices when it comes to preparing for baby. In fact, a recent survey1 conducted by Dreft found over half of parents-to-be stated that they began reading labels on products more closely and purchasing more natural food and drinks after discovering that they were expecting a little one. The same study found that 70% of those surveyed were planning to remove potentially harmful objects or products from their home upon their baby’s arrival. “Whether in their nurseries, their bathrooms or even their laundry room, moms and dads are looking for gentle alternatives for their bundles of joy,” said Mike Frey, Dreft Brand Manager. “As a trusted brand by families for more than 80 years, we’re excited to add Dreft purtouch to our product line-up to provide those parents who are seeking natural-based products with another baby detergent option. We’re proud to provide them with a gentle 65% plant-based baby detergent that uses renewable materials without sacrificing an effective clean. It’s the next step in our mission to design the best possible detergent for baby while thinking of their future world.” Until now, many people found they were giving up cleaning results when using a naturally-derived baby detergent. Dreft purtouch is different as it delivers the effective clean which makes Dreft the #1 pediatrician recommended baby detergent, while offering a 65% naturally-derived formula. This is important as irritating dirt, excess dyes and processing chemicals can linger on fabrics, making pre-washing an important step in helping to protect baby’s skin. In fact, 9 out of 10 dermatologists surveyed say that it is important to wash little one’s clothes with a gentle detergent before first wear2. “As both a pediatric dermatologist, and a mother of five children, I know how important it is to help shield a baby’s skin from irritants by pre-washing their items,” said Dr. Jody Levine, Director of Dermatology at Plastic Surgery and Dermatology of NYC, a leading medical practice in New York City. “When you think about all of the impurities that can remain on little one’s clothing – including dirt and irritating chemicals - it becomes critical that parents choose a detergent that cleans their baby’s fabrics effectively, yet gently, and I love that Dreft purtouch delivers on those needs.” As little ones grow, develop and explore their world, it’s also essential that parents seek out a detergent that can tackle the messes that come with babyhood. With a formula that helps remove 99% of baby stains, moms and dads can turn to Dreft purtouch to help gently clean their baby’s fabrics – for the first wash and every wash after that. Dreft purtouch features a light touch of the brand’s iconic baby fresh scent and is available in 40 ounce and 75 ounce bottles. The product can be found in the laundry or baby-care sections of most one-stop retailers, online retailers, as well as many baby specialty stores. Pricing is at the sole discretion of the retailer.
