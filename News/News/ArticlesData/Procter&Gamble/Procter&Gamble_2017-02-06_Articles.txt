DUO is a dual-sided body cleansing buffer that revolutionizes the look and feel of clean. It is the first time that a brand unites the clean of a bar, the care of a body wash and the experience of a puff to give users a multi-sensory, best of all worlds’ experience. Recent studies have shown the ideal shower experience has evolved over the years. People are seeking products that go beyond basic cleansing; craving more benefits in one step. Bar soaps are perceived to clean well, but can trade-off on delivering soft, smooth skin. Body washes are perceived to lather and nourish well while providing a great scent experience, but can trade-off on deep clean and exfoliation. As a result, 34 percent of men and 44 percent of women in the U.S. say they are using both a bar and body wash in the shower.1 “For over 130 years, from the launch of Ivory bar soap to the introduction of our body wash, Procter & Gamble has delivered innovative products based on evolutions in consumers’ needs,” said Stephanie Robertson, Associate Brand Director, Procter & Gamble North America Personal Cleansing. “The rise of the ‘dual user’ was an indication to us that there is a void in the market, which is leading to compensating behaviors – people using both a bar and body wash. DUOs is our answer to reimagine the shower experience all together.” Celebrated as “the never before seen two-sided clean,” the unique design of DUO boasts a flexible cleanser encapsulated by a two-sided cleaning implement – one side is smooth to soften and condition skin, while the other is scrubby, to exfoliate and renew skin surfaces. The flexible cleanser required a new formula consisting of the best cleaning powers of body wash and beauty bars as well as cellulose fiber to give the product its flexibility allowing it to conform to the body for an even closer clean. The scrubby side includes over 10,000 microscrubbers that provide a deeper clean than a body wash puff, while the soft side provides a cotton-like feel for gentle cleansing. The result is a deep, refreshing clean and noticeably invigorated, soft skin after every use. DUO is available in Olay, Old Spice and Ivory featuring Olay and Old Spice’s most popular scents with Olay Soothing Orchid & Black Currant Spice Swagger and Pure Sport, and introducing a new scent from Ivory with Refreshing Clean. DUO is available now in select mass and food retailers and eCommerce nationwide for $9.99 – $12.99 (MSRP). For more information, visit www.cleansingduos.com.

Press Release Receive press releases from World Vision Development Foundation Inc Philippines: By Email RSS Feeds: World Vision to Respond to Flooded Villages in Agusan del Sur Quezon City, Philippines, February 07, 2017 --(PR.com)-- Following the massive flooding in some areas of Mindanao, World Vision will be distributing clean water kits that include Procter & Gamble (P&G) water purifier packets, filter cloth and jerry cans and hygiene kits in the next days. “We initially aim to assist 2,500 families in the municipalities of La Paz and Loreto, Agusan del Sur. Let’s continue to uphold the families in prayer, those whose houses are still submerged, and especially for the protection of children from water-borne diseases,” says World Vision Acting National Director, Rommel Fuerte. Agusan del Sur is one of the five provinces of Caraga Administrative Region. According to the Field Health Service Information System (FHSIS) of the Department of Health, the ratio of households with access to safe water in the region is 56:100. Of the total households in 2006, only 46.57% have access to community water system while 53.43% have deep and shallow wells as their source of water. The flooding started in the first week of January after tropical storm Auring dumped heavy rains in the provinces of Visayas and Mindanao. It was followed by a low pressure area (LPA) and sustained by tail-end of a cold front. According to the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC), more than 600,000 people have been affected across nine regions of Visayas and Mindanao - Western Visayas, Central Visayas, Eastern Visayas, Zamboanga Peninsula, Northern Mindanao, Davao Region, Soccsksargen, Caraga and Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM).Nine casualties have been reported while more than 8,000 families are still in evacuation centres. To date, more than 254 areas are still submerged while 13 municipalities in the provinces of Lanao del Sur, Maguindanao, Davao Oriental, Agusan del Sur and Agusan del Norte are now under state of calamity. “It has been raining non-stop since the beginning of the year. We haven’t seen the sun for almost a month now. With this intervention, we hope to mitigate the spread of water-borne diseases and provide access to clean drinking water,” says Franlyn Salindato, World Vision staff based in Agusan del Sur. The P&G water purifier packet, which is able to treat up to 10 litres of water, was first introduced in Agusan del Sur in 2012 through World Vision’s Clean Water Project. Most families in the areas either rely on rainwater, deep wells or the lake for drinking water. For some who have money to spare, they buy. World Vision has assisted at least 40,000 people (9,000 families) through the Clean Water Project intervention.

Published on February 06, 2017. Fox Sports' Curt Menefee and Terry Bradshaw helped Tide create a 'live' Super Bowl spot.  Credit: Procter & Gamble Most Popular When Terry Bradshaw showed up with a shirt stain on what appeared to be live TV from the Fox broadcast booth at the Super Bowl, it marked the first time an advertiser had tried an integration so complex on so large a stage. His spill was, in fact, an elaborate pretaped stunt that teed up a commercial to be followed up late in the game with another commercial. Making the opening bit appear seamless was a long, highly complicated and often tense process for Procter & Gamble, its agency Saatchi & Saatchi and the directors at Traktor. "Tide's been in the Super Bowl a few times with some pretty great success, and so, if we're going to be in the game, we're going to do something pretty epic," said Paul Bichler, executive creative director at Saatchi & Saatchi. "The stakes were really high and we were dreaming up ideas that were never done before." Biggest launch One key task was for Tide to top itself. Its prior Tide Super Bowl ads were viewer favorites and award winners: The hilarious "Talking Stain" from 2008 featured a yammering blotch ruining a job interview, and the 2013 "Miracle Stain" summoned acolytes to worship a blemish that looked eerily like Joe Montana. Brand managers also wanted to bring an element of newness and surprise to a product that is 70 years old and already in almost half of the laundry rooms in the U.S. And failure would be costly, because the effort supported the introduction of Tide with Downy Pods, the brand's biggest launch of the year. Related Stories The Live Bowl (and How It's Changing the TV Landscape) "We saw dozens of rounds of scripts, and we are comfortable not launching a Super Bowl ad if it doesn't meet that high bar," said Amy Krehbiel, P&G associate brand director. "We saw three rounds with lots and lots of boards that were very good. They just weren't a Super Bowl ad." Then came the big idea to have "Fox NFL Sunday" host Mr. Bradshaw get caught in the broadcast booth with a spill on his shirt and clean it with Tide. "This one rose to the top because it had something that had never been done before, with Terry interrupting the middle of the game with a stain," Ms. Krehbiel said. "It was unbelievably funny; every time we watched it, we had people in the room laugh out loud and it was all about that insight that everyone feels—the anxiety of a stain and how, in the end, Tide was what you trust to get it out." A lot of eyeballs The key was securing the right time in the game for the setup with the spill, a commercial in which the soiled shirt was laundered and a closing kicker late in the game. And, of course, Mr. Bradshaw had to sign on. P&G declined to discuss specifics of its negotiations, but said NFL sponsorship helped get access to some league assets. Relative to what would follow, those were the easy parts. Mr. Bradshaw was game. As a media fixture, he knew the value of a Super Bowl ad. "It's going to have well in excess of 100 million [viewers] and more than probably a billion people worldwide when it's finally spread out in all the countries," Mr. Bradshaw said. "And advertisers, man, that's a lot of eyeballs." He also said it seemed logical for him to be the guy with the stain. "Who better than Curt Menefee and Terry Bradshaw," he said, "because I'm the co-host, he's the host and I'm kind of, you know, the guy that kind of gets in lots of trouble." But P&G could not prerelease its commercial, which is otherwise standard operating procedure for most Super Bowl advertisers today, or risk any leaks whatsoever, because it would spoil the surprise and the social media blaze that executives hoped to ignite. 'There's a screwup' The directing collective Traktor had another little difficulty immediately. "Since we're Swedish, we really don't know much about football," said Sam Larsson, one member of the collective. He and partner Patrik von Krusenstjerna had to look up who Terry Bradshaw was. The bigger challenge was convincing the audience that something unusual was happening. "To make the viewer actually believe this is happening for real, at least five or 10 seconds into the spot you have to have everyone actually stop and look at it and think, 'There's a screwup. Fox is actually doing some screwup,'" said Mr. Larsson. To protect that illusion, "every detail had to be absolutely perfect," said Mr. Bichler. "This was going to be a massive team effort, both in the agency and the brand to do this. And that team had to grow a lot to include Fox and the NFL because they're both properties that are playing a role in this. We had to be able to simulate details immediately that really weren't even figured out yet, so we had to tackle that undertaking. And then present it on this immense, massive stage." Adding to the pressure was the absolute necessity to make the beginning indistinguishable from the real game booth. "When it's a Super Bowl spot, you know that everyone will not only look at it, they will actually dissect it," said Mr. von Krusenstjerna. Night filming The first part, filming Mr. Bradshaw and Jeffrey Tambor in a house in Altadena, Calif., went smoothly. But that kicked off a seven-day marathon shoot with deadlines increasingly bearing down. To preserve authenticity for the stain spot, P&G had to wait to see which four teams would make the playoffs so that the jerseys in the shot were correct. Actual filming began about three weeks prior to the Super Bowl. "That's pretty late," said Mr. Bichler. "That doesn't leave us a lot of time for some of the effects and some of the posts we are going to be able to do." And there were other hurdles. Because the actual game is played after dark, the scenes showing Mr. Bradshaw outside the stadium seeking to wash his shirt had to be filmed at night. "It's important that we can match the lighting of the Super Bowl," said Ms. Krehbiel. And above all, the set had to be credible. To make it so, the production team erected an enormous and painstakingly accurate replica of the Fox Sports broadcast booth on the football field at El Camino College in Torrance, Calif., and finally got ready to film with Mr. Bradshaw. And then came the rain. The set soaked, the team raced to break it down and reconstruct it inside a garage in the stadium. "We've had rain on shoots before, but on other shoots we had more flexibility," said Ms. Krehbiel. "We'd been able to move it to another day. But in this one, we've got the talent, we've got the puzzle, so everyone had to get creative. We had to move inside and use a green screen." The shot completed and the editing finally done, the team now had one job—to wait. "We hope the internet goes crazy," said Ms. Krehbiel in an interview before the game. And while, of course, the goal is to sell Tide, the plan was to entertain and amaze. "We hope it's something that takes people on a journey for a long period of time," she said, "and afterwards they look back and say, 'How did they do that?' " In this article: Celebrity Special Report: Super Bowl TV Become a Member Register Now Renew Membership Benefits Datacenter Advertising Age     Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Instagram YouTube Tumblr Copyright © 1994-2017 Crain Communications Privacy Statement Terms of Use About Us Advertise Reprints Contact Us AD AGE Creativity LookBook Datacenter Resources Events Jobs On Campus Site by AREA 17

DANIEL MIHAILESCU/AFP/Getty Images Yesterday was the biggest day of the year in advertising. Superbowl ads get buzz leading up to the game and sometimes great ones drive chatter for days or weeks after. The public seldom treats digital ads with that kind of anticipation. In fact, ad blocker use has shifted from a personal preference of the tech savvy to a global boycott. Mark Pritchard doesn’t blame web users for turning to ad blockers. “We’ve seen an exponential increase in… well… crap,” he told the Interactive Advertising Bureau’s 2017 Leadership Meeting. Pritchard oversees brands at the consumer products company, which includes household names such as Tide, Crest and Gillette, and he’s tired of waiting for digital advertising’s ecosystem to grow up. It’s had more than 20 years, he said. It’s time. Obviously, the company selling some of the biggest laundry detergents and toothpastes in the world commands a lot of power in the advertising space. It spent $7.2 billion on advertising in 2016, according to its annual report. Pritchard told the IAB that the digital media supply chain needs to grow up in the way television did long ago. If publishers refuse, they’ll lose out on P&G’s ample advertising budget (and where it leads, similar companies are likely to follow). In a video from the IAB that went up on YouTube last week, he laid out a five point plan that P&G has undertaken to reform the industry. He invited his peers on the ad buying side to join his company. “We’re all wasting way too much time on and money on a media supply chain with poor standards adoption,” Pritchard said. “We have a media supply chain that’s murky at best and fraudulent at worst.” Here’s what P&G now does to press reform: Only buy from companies that report results using the Media Ratings Council’s viewability standard. Every tech company that sells ads wants to be treated as its own special snowflake, with its own way of measuring its effectiveness. Viewability means, “Did it make it onto the screen where human eyes can see it.” Pritchard doesn’t have any patience for trying to compare results on Twitter to results on Facebook anymore. He wants one standard that cuts across every platform. It doesn’t have to be perfect “We’d rather spend time creating better advertising than debating the viewability standard with every publisher or agency,” Pritchard said. “We will no longer tolerate the ridiculous complexity of different viewability standards.” We recently reported on public radio’s effort to establish a standard about what a “download” means for a podcast episode. Only buy from companies that implement accredited third party verification. “We need an objective impartial judge to perform the measurement,” Pritchard said. In TV, that’s Nielsen. His company is no longer willing to accept publishers self-reporting viewability results. The conflict of interest is too obvious. And we know that Facebook screwed up a bunch of reporting last year, because it admitted to at least some mis-reporting. Who knows how severe it has to get before a company comes clean? Last Fall, Mashable reported that advertisers generally shared Pritchard’s dissatisfaction with self-reporting in digital. Pritchard told a story of bringing precisely this concern with an unnamed tech company, who told him that his competitors had been “leaning forward” into a future-oriented way of doing business (we can’t help but suspect that that Pritchard emphasized that phrase as a clue to the company he was talking about). “We’ve been leaning forward for several years and it’s going to stop,” Pritchard promised. Insist on transparent agency contracts. Big companies like P&G don’t usually make all the buys in their ad campaigns. They turn the specifics over to agencies that sort out the details. Have you ever heard an ad for a giant company on a tiny radio station in the middle of nowhere and wondered who at that big company thought about that little station? No one did. An advertising agency did it for them. In digital, it’s becoming clear that many of these agencies get kickbacks from places that publish ads. This causes P&G to doubt its agencies are really making the optimal choices for placing its creative work. It’s not all bad news for ad agencies, though. The company is also assessing whether it should pay agencies more so they don’t feel the need to look for kickbacks. Prevent ad fraud. No one has ever clicked on a print ad. Because people can click on digital ads, publishers often get paid based on engagement rather than impressions. This has led to a criminal economy where fake sites publish and fake people click. “Criminals prey on big money,” Pritchard said. When a lot of money swirls around in a complex and opaque system, that makes for an especially easy mark for ne’er-do-wells. P&G pointed at the Trustworthy Accountability Group as a solution for advertisers to ensure that ads get seen by real humans. P&G will vote with its dollars. “These are the steps we expect,” Pritchard said. “We were work with and buy media only from those companies that comply.” He went public with these commitments at the IAB meeting, but P&G has been giving this message to partners privately for roughly the last year. They’ve had time to get on board. Every advertiser will do better, he argued, if companies compete on product quality and creative work rather than trying to eke out a special angle as technology changes. In fact, he contends, companies like his are ill equipped to find those tricks. Online criminals and fraudsters, however, are great at it. Correction: A previous version of this story incorrectly referred to the IAB as the “Internet Advertising Bureau.” Updated February 7, 2017 10:23 AM.

We have taken their feedback on-board and married it to key global media and marketing trends, creating an event that addresses these needs. "This year's agenda will be brave and unafraid to confront and discuss the biggest issues affecting society, such as Brexit, Donald Trump as US president, inclusive work forces, a fear of professional failure, and understanding what consumers really want.

The New England Patriots face the Atlanta Falcons in Super Bowl 51, on Sunday, Feb. 5, 2017. (Procter & Gamble via AP) NEW YORK (AP) — The New England Patriots defeated the Atlanta Falcons during a nailbiter Super Bowl 51 — and there were clear winners and losers off the field, too. Advertisers had to tread carefully this year in a divisive political climate. Some went for all out escapist humor like T-Mobile and Tide, while others tried to take a more serious tone like the American Petroleum Institute. With 30-second ads costing around $5 million, and more than 110 million people watching, it's a huge gamble to advertise during the game even in a less politically charged atmosphere. Here are the winners whose gamble paid off, and losers who struck the wrong tone. WINNER: TIDE P&G's Tide ad featuring announcer Terry Bradshaw seemed at first to be part of the game broadcast. But when Bradshaw gets a stain on his shirt, he goes on an adventure featuring New England Patriot Rob Gronkowski and actor Jeffrey Tambor to try to find a clean shirt. "It was just from the writing to the casting pure fun," said Mark DiMassimo, CEO of ad agency DiMassimo Goldstein. WINNER: KIA Kia managed to touch on social issues without offending people by tapping Melissa McCarthy to take on causes like saving whales, ice caps and trees, each time to disastrous effect. Kia's 60-second third-quarter ad promotes the fuel efficiency of its 2017 Niro car. WINNER: NFL Two NFL ads aimed to appeal to all. The first ad , "Inside These Lines," narrated by Forest Whitaker, showed scenes of football games and workers prepping a field. The narration stated: "Inside these lines, we may have our differences, but recognize there is more that unites us." Another ad showed Super Bowl babies resembling NFL stars like Chicago Bears coach Mike Ditka and former Seattle Seahawks running back Marshawn Lynch to the tune of Chicago's "You're the Inspiration." WINNER: BUDWEISER Budweiser managed to capture the pre-game buzz with its "Born the Hard Way" spot. The cinematic 60-second spot chronicles co-founder Adolphus Busch's journey from Germany to St. Louis in 1857. He jumps off a burning steamboat and catches a glimpse of Budweiser's iconic Clydesdales mascots before meeting fellow immigrant Eberhard Anheuser. Some people took to Twitter to protest the immigration theme of the ad, but the ad was still one of the most watched ads ahead of the game. WINNER: T-MOBILE The wireless carrier made a big splash during the game by buying up 3 minutes of airtime and stuffing its ads with celebrities. In one ad , Snoop Dogg and Martha Stewart discuss T-Mobile's unlimted data plan with lots of innuendo about Snoop's pot-smoking habit. Kristen Schaal started in two other adparodies of "50 Shades of Grey" that implied having a Verizon plan is like being punished — S&M style. And Justin Bieber and New England Patriots' Rob Gronkowski danced in another ad for the brand. LOSER: AMERICAN PETROLEUM INSTITUTION An ad by a trade group sought to rebrand oil's image, opening with the line that "This ain't your daddy's oil." The ad showed a series of colorful ways oil is allegedly used, including in spray paint and makeup. It said the "oil pumps life," ''oil runs cleaner" and "oil explores space" — unexpected phrases for many that drew some mockery on social media. The American Petroleum Institute says on its website that it represents the oil and natural gas industry, including producers, refiners, suppliers and pipeline operators. Villanova University marketing professor Charles Taylor said its message didn't get across. "They're trying to somehow emphasize environmentalism, but I don't think they did it in a way that most consumers would find believable," he said. LOSER: FEBREZE P&G's ad sought to take a humorous approach to saluting the well-known halftime bathroom break. "I love you halftime bathroom break," says actress Kathryn Hahn during the commercial. But not everyone found the "potty humor" appealing. LOSER: SNICKERS Snicker's hyped up its live ad in the third quarter. The ad, set on a Wild West set, started with actor Adam Driver talking about the 21-3 score to prove it was live. But then things seem to go wrong and the set falls apart — on purpose. "You ruin live Super Bowl commercials when you're hungry," the copy reads on screen. "It went by so fast, I almost missed it," said DiMassimo Goldstein CEO Mark DiMassimo. "I think the audience got it (but I'm) not sure it was worth the trouble of doing it live." LOSER: WENDY'S Wendy's sought to emphasize its message of "Always fresh, never frozen" in its ad which showed a meatlocker full of frozen beef and a worker trying to thaw it with a hair dryer to the tune of Foreigner's "Cold as Ice." Ad critic Barbara Lippert says the ad is unappetizing. "All it does is leave you hearing frozen, frozen, frozen," she noted.

"They're trying to somehow emphasize environmentalism, but I don't think they did it in a way that most consumers would find believable," he said. LOSER: FEBREZE P&G's ad sought to take a humorous approach to saluting the well-known halftime bathroom break. "I love you halftime bathroom break," says actress Kathryn Hahn during the commercial. But not everyone found the "potty humor" appealing. LOSER: SNICKERS Snicker's hyped up its live ad in the third quarter. The ad, set on a Wild West set, started with actor Adam Driver talking about the 21-3 score to prove it was live. But then things seem to go wrong and the set falls apart — on purpose. "You ruin live Super Bowl commercials when you're hungry," the copy reads on screen. "It went by so fast, I almost missed it," said DiMassimo Goldstein CEO Mark DiMassimo. "I think the audience got it (but I'm) not sure it was worth the trouble of doing it live." LOSER: WENDY'S Wendy's sought to emphasize its message of "Always fresh, never frozen" in its ad which showed a meatlocker full of frozen beef and a worker trying to thaw it with a hair dryer to the tune of Foreigner's "Cold as Ice." Ad critic Barbara Lippert says the ad is unappetizing. "All it does is leave you hearing frozen, frozen, frozen," she noted.

Let’s continue to uphold the families in prayer, those whose houses are still submerged, and especially for the protection of children from water-borne diseases,” says World Vision Acting National Director, Rommel Fuerte. Agusan del Sur is one of the five provinces of Caraga Administrative Region. According to the Field Health Service Information System (FHSIS) of the Department of Health, the ratio of households with access to safe water in the region is 56:100. Of the total households in 2006, only 46.57% have access to community water system while 53.43% have deep and shallow wells as their source of water. The flooding started in the first week of January after tropical storm Auring dumped heavy rains in the provinces of Visayas and Mindanao. It was followed by a low pressure area (LPA) and sustained by tail-end of a cold front. According to the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC), more than 600,000 people have been affected across nine regions of Visayas and Mindanao - Western Visayas, Central Visayas, Eastern Visayas, Zamboanga Peninsula, Northern Mindanao, Davao Region, Soccsksargen, Caraga and Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM).Nine casualties have been reported while more than 8,000 families are still in evacuation centres. To date, more than 254 areas are still submerged while 13 municipalities in the provinces of Lanao del Sur, Maguindanao, Davao Oriental, Agusan del Sur and Agusan del Norte are now under state of calamity. “It has been raining non-stop since the beginning of the year. We haven’t seen the sun for almost a month now. With this intervention, we hope to mitigate the spread of water-borne diseases and provide access to clean drinking water,” says Franlyn Salindato, World Vision staff based in Agusan del Sur. The P&G water purifier packet, which is able to treat up to 10 litres of water, was first introduced in Agusan del Sur in 2012 through World Vision’s Clean Water Project. Most families in the areas either rely on rainwater, deep wells or the lake for drinking water. For some who have money to spare, they buy. World Vision has assisted at least 40,000 people (9,000 families) through the Clean Water Project intervention.

PHOTO | DIANA NGILA  In Summary The rapid expansion of the retail sector is driven by several shopping dynamics including a tendency by Kenyan consumers to shop for goods in bulk. The availability of quality brands and better prices for bulk purchases are said to have contributed to the expansion. The study says that over half of Kenyan urbanites now shop in supermarkets regularly. Advertisement By BRIAN NGUGI Kenya’s retail spending hit Sh1.8 trillion in 2016 as the sector expanded by 13 per cent, a new survey by Procter & Gamble (P&G) shows. The survey, released on Tuesday, says the rapid expansion of the retail sector is driven by several shopping dynamics including a tendency by Kenyan consumers to shop for goods in bulk as opposed to shopping for individual items when the need arises. “The total cumulative figure for retail spending in 2016 is $17.62 billion (Sh1.8 trillion) which can be allocated across different channels based on 30 per cent supermarkets, 67 per cent traditional retail, and three per cent special channels. Overall, retail spending accounts for 30 per cent of Kenya’s GDP,” said P&G, one of the biggest manufacturers of consumer products. The availability of quality brands and better prices for bulk purchases are said to have contributed to the expansion. The study says that over half of Kenyan urbanites now shop in supermarkets regularly. This is driven by the fact that supermarkets stock branded products which are well known and perceived to be of good quality, says the study. “Kenya was reclassified as a middle-income economy in 2015 and this is being evidenced by the shopping habits and rising consumerism. Although traditional retail stores still dominate the fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) sector, supermarkets and hypermarkets are catching up fast,” said P&G managing director Vivek Sunder. The study points out that supermarkets are moving into residential areas as residents’ buying power increases. “This is happening because neighbourhoods are now dense enough that they have the spending power to sustain such businesses, and also out of the need for retailers to compete with traditional traders on convenience. Proximity will be one of the big drivers for supermarkets as a channel gaining importance within retail,” the report says. READ: Kenya retail sector second most formalised in Africa on middle class growth The rise in the cost of living has made consumers more discerning, opting for retail stores with a variety of products. “Inflation has made consumers start to make choices between the products they buy, this is one of the reasons why supermarkets are welcome these days. ‘‘Supermarket shelves represent choice, and choice makes it possible for shoppers to feel like they’re making smart decisions in an inflation-ridden environment,” it says. Meanwhile, e-commerce and m-commerce are driving the growth of non-store retailing. M-commerce, where Kenyans use mobile payment to shop, has tripled in the past two years making it the fastest growing sector in retail, according to the study. “Traditional retail still dominates the market although supermarkets and malls, a distant second, are catching up as the choice shopping destination for Kenyans,” it notes. Malls and proposed shopping complexes currently occupy more than 470,000 square metres of land including residential areas and attract more retailers who would not travel to the city to shop. P&G’s data also reveals that Kenyans  spend the bulk of their income (about 60 per cent) on food and beverages and 23 per cent is spent on personal and household care products. email print In the headlines 4 drug suspects arrested in Mombasa Two Seychelles nationals and two South Africans were arrested.

Comments aAFont Size About 8th Street Market Ten acres along Eighth Street in the Bentonville Market District near the Bentonville square will ultimately showcase culinary education, music and the arts, restaurants and hospitality venues, and other specialized food and drink concepts. The Northwest Arkansas Community College expanded culinary arts and hospitality program Brightwater operates at the site. Bentonville-based Bike Rack Brewery announced it will open an 8,000-foot facility at the site that will feature and teach the full production brewing process, as well as sell beer brewed on site. Source: Octagon Events and Hospitality BENTONVILLE -- The Bite NW Arkansas food festival will have a new home this year. The event, part of the LPGA's Walmart NW Arkansas Championship presented by P&G, will be held June 22-23 at 8th Street Market in Bentonville. The Walmart Arkansas Music Pavilion in Rogers hosted the first two years of the event, which were sold out. The 11th annual golf tournament runs June 19-25 at Pinnacle Country Club in Rogers. "The LPGA [the NW Arkansas Championship] is such a regional event, it really impacts all of Northwest Arkansas," said Dana Davis, president and CEO of the Greater Bentonville Area Chamber of Commerce. "With 8th Street Market becoming a foodie destination, and when you think of the businesses that are going to be there and the culinary things they're trying to do, it makes sense to hold [Bite] at that site." The format of the two-day food festival will be the same as in previous years, comprised of Taste of NW Arkansas, a traditional restaurant showcase, on the first night and the Burgers and Beer Fest on the second. The festival will coincide with the opening of 8th Street Market, a 10-acre location designed for culinary education, restaurants, entertainment and hospitality at 801 SE Eighth St., between E and J streets, approximately one mile from the downtown square. Northwest Arkansas Community College's program Brightwater: A Center for the Study of Food operates out of the location, but the remainder of the facility will not open to the public until summer. "As we look to the next 10 years, the vision is to expand into the greater Northwest Arkansas community," said Harry Hardy, event director. "The timing works out perfectly, almost too good to be true. We're excited to have a new home for Bite." The venue was a natural fit for the festival because it was built with culinary purposes in mind and offers the cold storage and equipment necessary for it, Hardy said. The ability to host events indoor and outdoors, as well as its close proximity to the trail system were added benefits. "Visit Bentonville and the city of Bentonville are very culinary focused, it's a key part of our image," said Kalene Griffith, president and CEO of Visit Bentonville. "Culinary is its own attraction -- an integral part of the tourist experience -- and having the festival is a huge bonus. It takes a regional effort, but we all benefit [from it]." More than 35 restaurants and 15 area breweries participated in 2016 Bite NW Arkansas, which served 2,000 people. Most of the same vendors and chefs, such as Tyson Director of Research and Development Culinary Services Mario Valdovino, will return alongside a few new faces, Hardy said. The goal is to attract 3,000 ticket holders. Bike Rack Brewery in Bentonville will be among the vendors inside the 8th Street Market. Beer will be brewed on site at Bike Rack's 8,000-square-foot facility that will feature a tap room with capacity for 90 people. Bike Rack Brewery also has its original location at 401 SW A St., Suite 6. "We are ecstatic that Bite NW Arkansas is moving to 8th Street Market and that our brewery will have the chance to help grow the impact of the event," Jeff Charlson, CEO and partner of Bike Rack Brewing Company, said in a news release. "For two years, Bite has paired great food with great beer. That's authentic to the mission of Bike Rack and what I think we can expect to see at 8th Street Market in the long term." Festival ticket prices will remain the same as 2016 -- $50 per couple, $30 for individuals, and will go on sale March 1. "People think it's a really cool event, and we work hard to create an atmosphere about the community -- once you buy a ticket, you don't have to get your wallet out again," Hardy said. "That's the beauty of it, bringing restaurants from the whole region to one place." The festival venue change will allow Brightwater to showcase its new culinary facilities and capabilities through hands-on cooking demonstrations. "Given all the culinary and hospitality growth throughout Northwest Arkansas, Bite NW Arkansas is a great way to help introduce 8th Street Market and Brightwater," Glenn Mack, executive director of Brightwater, said in a news release. "Brightwater and our students have been a part of Bite from its inception and now that we share the site, I'm sure our engagement will only grow in the future."

Korea culls 33 mln poultry amid worst bird flu outbreak The Korea Herald > Business > Industry [NEWSMAKER] P&G embroiled in safety scandal Government has no guidelines on toxins in question, leaving consumers to decide safety for themselves   Published : 2017-02-07 15:31 Updated : 2017-02-07 15:31 Personal care and household goods maker Procter and Gamble is under fire for selling diapers that allegedly contain potentially toxic substances. Although large discount retailers have pulled the company‘s Pampers Baby Dry diapers off their shelves following the controversy, the South Korean government has not been able to issue an official recall or pursue punitive measures because there are no clear regulations here regarding the detected toxins. On Jan. 24, French consumer magazine 60 Millions de Consommateurs (60 Million Consumers) reported that a study had revealed the presence of traces of “potentially toxic” substances in many of the disposable diapers sold in France. The list of the potentially dangerous products included Pampers Baby Dry, which is sold in Korea.   (Pampers website) The French magazine had claimed that it had detected 0.000533 picogram per gram toxicity equivalency factor of dioxin, approximately 1/188th the level permitted for baby products in Europe.  Late last week, Lotte Mart, Homeplus and E-mart announced they would pull Pampers Baby Dry from their product lineup. On Friday, the Korean Agency for Technology and Standards, which is under the purview of the Industry Ministry, said it would begin a safety investigation into the P&G product. The hit to P&G comes just a month after the company’s fabric refresher Febreze was cleared from a list of potentially dangerous products released by the Environment Ministry. Last year, the product had been suspected of including toxic levels of an antimicrobial agent that could damage the lungs. P&G has denied the French magazine‘s allegations that these toxins were included in their products. “We don’t know how those tests were conducted,” a spokeswoman for the company said.  “What we can say for certain is that those compounds were never used intentionally in our products. Even the amounts that the French tests claim were detected (in the products) are at an extremely minute and harmless level.” P&G is also declining to refund consumers for previous purchases of Pampers Baby Dry, maintaining its stance there is nothing wrong with the products. However, consumers and distributors remain wary because the government does not have any clear standards on how much of these compounds could be considered safe.  Currently in Korea, diapers are categorized under the Children‘s Products Safety Act as requiring “safety management.”  Diapers must undergo testing for 19 different chemicals including formaldehyde, but the screening list does not include dioxin or pesticide compounds that the magazine claimed were found in the P&G diapers including hexachlorobenzene and pentachloronitrobenzene. The absence of clear government regulations in consumer product safety is making consumers, especially mothers, anxious about all of the other products that may have gone unchecked. In online communities, some mothers have even taken the issue into their own hands.  “I’m going to personally study the compounds in various baby products that I use,” said one post on a popular online community that focuses on baby care.  The government has said that after concluding its investigation of the Pampers Baby Dry products, it may expand the investigation to include all diapers sold in Korea.

These Awards recognise communications planning that has made a positive impact on business results. The Effective use of technology category rewards those communications that have effectively used or combined emerging platforms or technology in the media mix. Old Spice's Nature Adventure from Wieden + Kennedy was a gaming-led campaign in the US and Canada on live-streaming platform Twitch which helped the brand to build affinity with 18-34 year old men. Tom Goodwin, EVP, Head of Innovation at Zenith and a Warc Media Awards judge in the Effective Use of Tech category observed: "As an industry, we ignore gaming but it's such a big opportunity and no one's doing it that well. This should be celebrated because it used custom integration. It was different, interesting and effective." Cancer Research UK's Tap to Beat Cancer campaign, by MediaCom, saw the charity trial digital screens with a contactless card payment facility in its shop windows. Suzy Ryder, Managing Partner, Digital and Technology, OMD and a judge, described it as "a very easy and logical way to maintain and increase fundraising." Australian youth mental health foundation Headspace was the third Gold awarded by the judges for its Reword campaign. Through Leo Burnett Melbourne, the organisation helped to reduce instances of online bullying by young internet users through the introduction of an online tool that encourages people to reconsider what they've written before posting. James Lewin, Head of Innovation, Mindshare APAC, and a judge for this category, said: "It is a brilliant piece of tech and the results speak for themselves." PHD India picked up a Silver and a Bronze in this category for its work for two Hindustan Unilever detergent brands. The agency's Lo Kar Lo Baat initiative for Active Wheel won a Silver, while the Rin Career Ready Academy took a Bronze. FP7/DXB also won a Silver and a Bronze. Its A/C Vests campaign for banking brand Emirates NBD took a Silver, while its Smart Buses work for Bahrain telecoms provider Batelco won a Bronze. Zenith took a silver for its Artificial Intelligence: Data Storytelling campaign for insurance company Aviva; Starcom's Serving What's Trending campaign for food manufacturer Kraft Heinz took a Bronze.

Published on February 06, 2017. Credit: Lamar Most Popular If Procter & Gamble Co. Chief Brand Officer Marc Pritchard wants ad viewability, he's getting it, right from the windows of his corporate headquarters. In response to Mr. Pritchard's speech last week to the IAB Annual Leadership Meeting on the problems of digital ad viewability and fraud, among other things, the Outdoor Advertising Association of America has put up six billboards near P&G headquarters in Cincinnati shouting out: "Hey Marc, This ad is real." The Cincinnati effort revives the OAAA's "Feel the Real" campaign originally introduced in 2015, which went on hiatus last year in favor of a pro bono voter-registration effort. Lamar Advertising donated the space for the new Cincinnati campaign, including a prominent spot along the on ramp to a major thoroughfare heading east from P&G headquarters that's been used in the past by such rivals as Unilever and Church & Dwight Co. to tweak P&G marketers. Marc Pritchard. The new ads are 100% viewable by their target audience for as many seconds as he cares to look. P&G spokeswoman Tressie Rose confirmed that Mr. Pritchard had seen the one nearest the headquarters. She added: "We agree. The ad is real." The campaign was created by Partners & Napier in Rochester, New York, a Project Worldwide agency. The ads direct curious onlookers to campaign website FeeltheReal.org. The first wave of ads included 1,500 placements in 15 markets nationwide targeting 50 ad agencies, often in billboards or transit shelters near their offices and sometimes calling out individual agency executives or creative directors, said OAAA Chief Marketing Officer Stephen Freitas. The idea isn't entirely about poking fun at viewership problems of digital media. It's also meant to portray out-of-home as "a perfect complement to the digital space, because it's out there in the real world and can help guide you to some of that digital content," Mr. Freitas said. But then, when news of Mr. Pritchard's speech hit last week, the OAAA also welcomed the opportunity to point out that its medium has few viewability issues, he said. "It's also a great use case to say look at how targeted out-of-home can be."

OAAA Shares Real Data for Its 'Feel The Real' Campaign Billboards might seem like a blunt instrument to reach Mr. Pritchard plus maybe his fellow P&G marketers. But the OAAA wouldn't be the first to give that a go in the headquarters city of the world's biggest ad spender. Billboards that went up largely in neighborhoods surrounding downtown last year bearing the Snapchat logo were aimed at least in part at catching the eye of P&G marketers, said a person familiar with that campaign. Similarly, Radiocentre, the trade group for U.K. commercial radio, targeted rival Unilever Chief Marketing and Communications Officer Keith Weed, who oversees the world's second biggest ad budget, in radio ads there last year.

Advertisers had to tread carefully this year in a divisive political climate. Some went for all out escapist humour like T-Mobile and Tide, while others tried to take a more serious tone like the American Petroleum Institute. With 30-second ads costing around $5 million, and more than 110 million people watching, it's a huge gamble to advertise during the game even in a less politically charged atmosphere. Here are the winners whose gamble paid off, and losers who struck the wrong tone. Winner: TIDE P&G's Tide ad featuring announcer Terry Bradshaw seemed at first to be part of the game broadcast. But when Bradshaw gets a stain on his shirt, he goes on an adventure featuring New England Patriot Rob Gronkowski and actor Jeffrey Tambor to try to find a clean shirt. "It was just from the writing to the casting pure fun," said Mark DiMassimo, CEO of ad agency DiMassimo Goldstein. Winner: KIA Kia managed to touch on social issues without offending people by tapping Melissa McCarthy to take on causes like saving whales, ice caps and trees, each time to disastrous effect. Kia's 60-second third-quarter ad promotes the fuel efficiency of its 2017 Niro car. Winner: NFL Two NFL ads aimed to appeal to all. The first ad , "Inside These Lines," narrated by Forest Whitaker, showed scenes of football games and workers prepping a field. The narration stated: "Inside these lines, we may have our differences, but recognize there is more that unites us." Another ad showed Super Bowl babies resembling NFL stars like Chicago Bears coach Mike Ditka and former Seattle Seahawks running back Marshawn Lynch to the tune of Chicago's "You're the Inspiration." Winner: Budweiser Budweiser managed to capture the pre-game buzz with its "Born the Hard Way" spot. The cinematic 60-second spot chronicles co-founder Adolphus Busch's journey from Germany to St. Louis in 1857. He jumps off a burning steamboat and catches a glimpse of Budweiser's iconic Clydesdales mascots before meeting fellow immigrant Eberhard Anheuser. Some people took to Twitter to protest the immigration theme of the ad, but the ad was still one of the most watched ads ahead of the game. Winner: T-Mobile The wireless carrier made a big splash during the game by buying up 3 minutes of airtime and stuffing its ads with celebrities. In one ad , Snoop Dogg and Martha Stewart discuss T-Mobile's unlimted data plan with lots of innuendo about Snoop's pot-smoking habit. Kristen Schaal started in two other adparodies of "50 Shades of Grey" that implied having a Verizon plan is like being punished – ” S&M style. And Justin Bieber and New England Patriots' Rob Gronkowski danced in another ad for the brand. Loser: American Petroleum Institutions An ad by a trade group sought to rebrand oil's image, opening with the line that "This ain't your daddy's oil." The ad showed a series of colorful ways oil is allegedly used, including in spray paint and makeup. It said the "oil pumps life," ''oil runs cleaner" and "oil explores space" â€” unexpected phrases for many that drew some mockery on social media. The American Petroleum Institute says on its website that it represents the oil and natural gas industry, including producers, refiners, suppliers and pipeline operators. Villanova University marketing professor Charles Taylor said its message didn't get across. "They're trying to somehow emphasize environmentalism, but I don't think they did it in a way that most consumers would find believable," he said. Loser: Febreeze P&G's ad sought to take a humorous approach to saluting the well-known halftime bathroom break. "I love you halftime bathroom break," says actress Kathryn Hahn during the commercial. But not everyone found the "potty humour" appealing. Loser: Snickers Snicker's hyped up its live ad in the third quarter. The ad, set on a Wild West set, started with actor Adam Driver talking about the 21-3 score to prove it was live. But then things seem to go wrong and the set falls apart – on purpose. "You ruin live Super Bowl commercials when you're hungry," the copy reads on screen. "It went by so fast, I almost missed it," said DiMassimo Goldstein CEO Mark DiMassimo. "I think the audience got it (but I'm) not sure it was worth the trouble of doing it live." Loser: Wendy's Wendy's sought to emphasize its message of "Always fresh, never frozen" in its ad which showed a meatlocker full of frozen beef and a worker trying to thaw it with a hair dryer to the tune of Foreigner's "Cold as Ice." Ad critic Barbara Lippert says the ad is unappetizing. "All it does is leave you hearing frozen, frozen, frozen," she noted.   Mae Anderson, The Associated Press We encourage an open exchange of ideas on this story's topic, but we ask you to follow our guidelines for respecting community standards.

To support Ad Age and the industry we cover please either: SUBSCRIBE or WHITELIST US P&G Rallies Marketers to Fix Digital Ads, but Who Will Follow? By Jack Neff. Published on February 06, 2017. Marc Pritchard Credit: IAB Most Popular Procter & Gamble Chief Brand Officer Marc Pritchard issued a call to arms before the IAB Annual Leadership Meeting last week. "The days of giving digital a pass are over," Mr. Pritchard said, urging the ad industry to follow P&G's lead by paying only for digital media that meets industry standards for "viewable" advertising, with results vetted by third parties. "It's time to grow up. It's time for action." Given the state of the digital ecosystem, however, a united front may be all but impossible. P&G and other marketers such as Clorox and Prudential Financial support the viewability standard of the industry's Media Rating Council, which deems ads "viewable" if at least half their pixels are on-screen for at least one second. For video, it's two seconds. Related Stories P&G Tells Digital to Clean Up, Lays Down New Rules for Agencies and Ad Tech to Get Paid But Prudential Financial uses the MRC standards as a "baseline," said Anna Papadopoulos, VP-integrated media services. She favors "partners who can guarantee much longer view times than two seconds for video and more than 50% viewability on display ads," such as Hulu and YouTube, she said. P&G is focusing on the MRC standards as a "minimum," said spokeswoman Tressie Rose, "to enable comparative measurement and learning." Rival Unilever, which has been outspoken about demanding tougher standards, declined to comment on whether it would close ranks with P&G and others using MRC metrics as a baseline. So did GroupM, whose viewability standards Unilever has been using. In their case, it might be considered backtracking. The GroupM standard calls for 100% of display pixels to be in view for any length of time, and 100% of videos to be visible for at least half the length of the ad, with the sound on and after someone clicks it. On the ground, however, things are even more nuanced. Some GroupM agencies routinely settle for less—i.e., the MRC threshold—when prices for its more restrictive standards get expensive, according to Brian Fitzgerald, president of digital publisher Evolve Media. GroupM declined to comment. The share of a campaign's ads that must be viewable also varies by agency and client, with some demanding 100% and others accepting less, Mr. Fitzgerald said. Even then, the ads rated viewable vary according to the auditor. Fifteen companies have MRC accreditation to measure viewability, down from more than 20 two years ago but still a Tower of Babel. Recent efforts have worked to reconcile differences among auditors, MRC CEO George Ivie said. "The data we've seen, mostly from agencies, has led us to believe the discrepancy issue has greatly reduced, essentially down to acceptable levels." Efforts to eliminate "invalid traffic," on the other hand, have added to differences. Many vendors have proprietary "sophisticated" safeguards, Mr. Ivie said, which can lead to more variation. Not everyone even agrees that a single set of metrics should apply. The Instagram experience "is dramatically different" than on YouTube or Snapchat, said Brandon Rhoten, VP-head of advertising, media and digital at Wendy's. The average time spent watching videos on YouTube, for example, is dramatically higher than on Facebook, he said. "I'm not sure that it's an apples-to-apples experience," he said. "So therefore, I don't know that it's apples-to-apples measurement."

Reghu Balakrishnan Renuka Ramnath, founder and chief executive, Multiples Alternate Asset Management Pvt. Ltd. Photo: Abhijit Bhatlekar/Mint Mumbai: Renuka Ramnath-led private equity (PE) fund Multiples Alternate Asset Management Pvt. Ltd is in advanced talks to buy a controlling stake in human resources (HR) outsourcing and technology firm PeopleStrong for Rs400 crore, two people aware of the development said. Multiples plans to buy about 80% in PeopleStrong from various funds, including PE firm Lumis Partners, HDFC Holdings and The HR Fund, the first of the two people said, on condition of anonymity. Global investment bank Lincoln International is advising PeopleStrong to find a buyer. Founded in 2005, PeopleStrong provides services to about 175 multinational and Indian clients, including Tata Motors Ltd, Hero MotoCorp Ltd, Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd, Procter and Gamble India Ltd, Mondelez India Foods Pvt. Ltd, HDFC Life, Indig o Airlines, Vistara, Cipla Ltd, Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd, Hindalco Industries Ltd, Wipro Ltd and CitiBank India. It is present in 40 Indian cities and employs more than 800 professionals. Founded in 2005, PeopleStrong received investments worth Rs50 crore early on. It received institutional funding from Lumis Partners in 2011 and a second round of funding from Lumis and HDFC Holdings in 2013. Its financial details and shareholding pattern is not yet known. In 2013, PeopleStrong had made a strategic investment in WheeBox, a talent assessment company, and acquired Webpay, a leading HR and payroll product provider in 2014. Mails sent to Pankaj Bansal, co-founder and chief executive officer, PeopleStrong; Rohit Bhayana, managing partner and co-founder, Lumis Partners, and mails and text messages sent to Utkarsh Joshi, principal, The HR Fund, and Renuka Ramnath, founder and chief executive of Multiples, went unanswered. Spokespersons for HDFC and Lincoln International declined to comment. “It is not yet clear whether the promoters of PeopleStrong, including Bansal, will retain their minority stake in the proposed transaction,” said the second person mentioned above on condition of anonymity. Before Multiples, there were talks with a handful of PE funds and global strategic investors, this person added. “In the past few years, there has been a high level of investor interest in HR firms, primarily those in the HR tech space, and to some extent, those in the broader staffing industry. HR tech is being viewed as a breakthrough sector in an industry which otherwise hasn’t changed significantly in the past 15 years,” said Sunit Mehra, managing partner at talent advisory firm Hunt Partners. Besides interest from PE funds, several HR-focused funds have been launched in the past. The HR Fund, one of the investors in PeopleStrong, is India’s first HR-focused private investment firm. Set up in 2011, The HR Fund invested in Gurgaon-based PeopleMatters Media Pvt. Ltd, Chennai-based HR start-up PiQube, Bengaluru-based talent transformation-focused software firm KNOLSKAPE Solutions Pvt.

The New England Patriots face the Atlanta Falcons in Super Bowl 51, on Sunday, Feb. 5, 2017. (Procter & Gamble via AP) comments Super Bowl ads typically tell viewers what kind of beer to drink, what kind of candy to eat and what sort of car to drive. This year, they will also suggest how to keep tidy after the event is over. Procter & Gamble, one of the nation's biggest manufacturers of consumer products like Pampers, Crest, and Dawn, is adding quite the clean-up crew to the Super Bowl ad roster. Fans who watch Super Bowl LI this Sunday will see spots for the company's Tide detergent, Febreze air freshener and Mr. Clean cleaning products. For the Cincinnati company, the presence is oversized: Super Bowl LI will mark the only time Procter & Gamble has run more than a single national ad in the Big Game since first dipping its toe into Super Bowl ad waters in 2004. And the move makes Procter one of the event's bigger sponsors this year, on par with Pepsi or Fiat Chrysler. Why is the maker of Bounty backing what might be called a triple-ply presence? Its move is emblematic of what media buyers and TV sales executives say has been a pronounced shift of ad spending in the last year. Consumer packaged goods companies -historically some of the biggest ad spenders on TV - have in recent years earmarked some of that money for digital outlets in a bid to keep pace with consumers testing out emerging venues like streaming video or mobile tablets. Over the last year, however, the sector has reversed course, and returned some of the money to TV. Marc Pritchard, P&G's chief brand officer, has in recent months been quite public about his desire to prioritize reach, or getting its marketing messages in front of masses of consumers. TV often provides a good means of attaining that goal. The Super Bowl ad ranks contain fewer makers of pharmaceuticals and automobiles, noted Bruce Lefkowitz, executive vice president of ad sales for Fox Networks Group, in an interview. But he said he has noticed a surge of interest from consumer-packaged goods companies. "They are starting to see the scale and attention they get at the Super Bowl are unsurpassed, and it comes on the heels of last year's upfront, when you saw a migration by consumer packaged goods companies from the digital world back into television," he said. In the "upfront," TV networks try to sell the bulk of their ad inventory for the coming program season. P&G has advertised Tide in past Super Bowls, but Mr. Clean and Febreze are making their debut. Tide, which has gained notice in previous editions of the gridiron classic with a 2008 ad featuring a talking stain, is expected to run an ad centered around football player Rob Gronkowski and actor Jeffrey Tambor. Febreze will highlight its new "OdorClear" technology which tackles odors in the air and surfaces. Mr. Clean will turn its bald-headed mascot into something of a romantic foil. Despite its decades of TV advertising, Procter is a relatively young Super Bowl sponsor. It first aligned itself with the Super Bowl in 2004, when it held an internal contest among six of its brands to see which one should get a Super Bowl commercial. The winner that year was Charmin. Since that time, P&G has taken to the football championship four other times. It placed Gillette on the field in 2006; ran ads for Tide in 2008 and 2013; and launched a commercial for Always in 2015. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;iframe class=&amp;quot;youtube-player&amp;quot; type=&amp;quot;text/html&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;670&amp;quot; height=&amp;quot;407&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/7gLjYrEDoxw?version=3&amp;amp;amp;rel=1&amp;amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;amp;autohide=2&amp;amp;amp;showsearch=0&amp;amp;amp;showinfo=1&amp;amp;amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;amp;amp;wmode=transparent&amp;quot; allowfullscreen=&amp;quot;true&amp;quot; style=&amp;quot;border:0;&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For the &amp;lt;location&amp;gt;Cincinnati&amp;lt;/location&amp;gt; company, the presence is oversized: Super Bowl LI will mark the only time &amp;lt;org value=&amp;quot;NYSE:PG&amp;quot; idsrc=&amp;quot;xmltag.org&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Procter &amp;amp;amp; Gamble&amp;lt;/org&amp;gt; has run more than a single national ad in the Big Game since first dipping its toe into &amp;lt;org&amp;gt;Super Bowl&amp;lt;/org&amp;gt; ad waters in 2004.

(image captured from video) By Tim Baysinger, Reuters Feb 6, 2017 at 8:14 am | Print View NEW YORK — With Americans’ attention more finely tuned to the political climate under U.S. President Donald Trump, brands that dove headfirst into that conversation generated the most reaction from viewers during Sunday’s Super Bowl. For much of the evening, the chatter around commercials by Airbnb Inc, Coca-Cola Co and Budweiser was more exciting than the Super Bowl itself. That changed late in the game, the New England Patriots pulled off a 25-point comeback to defeat the Atlanta Falcons in the National Football League’s first-ever overtime Super Bowl. With the thrilling finish, viewers could exceed the 114.4 million who watched 2015 Super Bowl in 2015, providing a massive audience for advertisers who paid more than $5 million for 30 seconds of airtime. A teaser for the second season of Netflix Inc’s hit show “Stranger Things,” as well as celebrity-studded and humorous ads from T-Mobile US Inc and Procter & Gamble Co’s Mr. Clean, drew the most attention on social media. Still, brands such as Airbnb, that leaned into subjects of diversity and immigration, by and large sparked the most conversation among viewers. The company’s ad, featuring a diverse group of employees touting a message of acceptance, will be seen by many as a criticism of Trump’s immigration policies. Airbnb was one of the last to buy a Super Bowl spot; co-founder Brian Chesky wrote on Twitter they purchased and shot the ad last Thursday. The commercial was among the most discussed by viewers, generating nearly 78,000 tweets between 6:30 p.m. and 11 p.m. EST, data from digital marketing technology company Amobee shows. During the pregame, Coca-Cola re-aired its ad from the 2014 Super Bowl, which featured “America the Beautiful” sung in different languages, which prompted more than 74,000 tweets. Budweiser’s spot, telling the story of Anheuser-Busch’s immigrant co-founder Adolphus Busch, and Pennsylvania-based building materials company 84 Lumber Co’s ad were among the most talked about as well. 84 Lumber’s commercial had to be reworked after Fox rejected an initial version that featured a border wall, which was in the company’s full-length online version. Amobee data found the sentiment for the ads skewed positive. Advertisers have been grappling with how to reach consumers in the political climate under Trump, when viewers’ increasingly partisan attitudes make it more difficult to market to a broad audience. “It’s America paying attention to us and really ranking us, when they so often try to ignore what advertising does,” said Ted Royer, chief creative officer of creative agency Droga5, which created Sprint Corp’s ad targeting rival carrier Verizon Communications Inc. Trump’s November election, and his subsequent action on immigration and other issues has nearly split the population. That divide has left the stakes higher for advertisers devising campaigns for some of the biggest U.S. brands, which typically avoid politics, for fear of upsetting consumers. “There’s a lot more anxiety, self-inflicted anxiety, in the country than there has been ever in the past,” said Mike Sheldon, chairman and chief executive of ad agency Deutsch, who created Busch’s first-ever Super Bowl ad.         Your next Nation & World articles Ford investing $1 billion in start-up New York man accused of bomb plot admits ...

Revenue, for the company which is one of the "big four" ad agencies, rose 2.1 percent to $4.24 billion, but missed analysts' average estimate of $4.26 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. New York-based Omnicom, whose clients include Apple Inc , Procter & Gamble, McDonald's Corp and Adidas, said negative impact of foreign exchange rates reduced revenue in the fourth quarter by 1.8 percent. The dollar had risen 6.8 percent against a basket of major currencies in the quarter ended Dec. 31. The company did not break up revenue by geography in its quarterly report. However, according to Thomson Reuters data, about 38 percent of Omnicom's total revenue in 2015 came from outside the Americas region. Omnicom said organic revenue in North America rose 0.6 percent in the latest quarter. Subsidiaries of Omnicom and fellow competitor Publicis Groupe SA were subpoenaed by the U.S. Department of Justice in December, as part of an investigation whether ad agencies had rigged bids to favor in-house production units. Rival Interpublic Group of Cos Inc earlier in December said that one of its domestic agencies had been contacted by the DoJ as part of the investigation. Advertising companies have been exploring new revenue streams and are trying to keep up with clients' increasing demand for video content. The company's net income rose to $348.7 million, or $1.47 per share, in the latest quarter, from $328.3 million, or $1.35 per share, a year earlier. Analysts' on average were expecting earnings of $1.44 per share.

A few will say it will do so for some of the wrong reasons. However, for many Northern Ireland companies it was a year of real achievement and progress. While there are many factors that encourage a good degree of caution as we enter 2017, we as a bank also see real reasons for optimism about the future for both Ulster Bank and local businesses. In 2016 we helped support a number of Northern Ireland's most successful and innovative businesses. Share Facebook Twitter Google Email Go To Comments By way of example, we supported north west-based Learning Pool in its strategic acquisition of Mind Click, whose clients include AstraZeneca, Boots, Procter & Gamble, and Google. As another illustration, we supported the £30m acquisition of Damolly Retail Park in Newry by MJM Group. And we remain strongly committed to helping good businesses achieve their ambitions in 2017 and beyond. We're also active in helping local entrepreneurs set out and advance on their growth journeys - our backing for the Entrepreneurial Spark Hub in Belfast is a key part of that, alongside the development of the skills of our people. The hub offers, among other things, free office space, free Wi-Fi, advice, and access to a powerful network of business mentors. Around 160 local businesses have made use of it to date, and during December alone entrepreneurs based there secured over £500,000 in investment. We have also just trained over 130 of our people on entrepreneurial skills so that they can continue to better support entrepreneurs and understand their mindset. Partnering with the Belfast Telegraph Business Awards is another expression of Ulster Bank's commitment to supporting the Northern Ireland business community. The awards are a well-established platform for celebrating the achievements of local companies, and we are really pleased, with the Belfast Telegraph, to be expanding the categories this year to include IT Company or Team of the Year, Emerging Business/Start Up of the Year, and SME Healthcare Business of the Year. As a bank that is active and supportive in each of these areas, we know that there are fantastic businesses doing innovative things who should have a platform to be recognised for their achievements. As we move further into 2017, we expect to see good Northern Ireland companies continuing to adapt to market conditions and generating further success. Effectively managing the things that are within their control is key to this - for example improving productivity and competitiveness, hedging currency and managing interest rate risks, and smoothing out fluctuations in working capital. A rising tide lifts all boats, but skilful sailors can still excel in any waters, and many businesses will continue to make good investments and develop expansion plans, whatever lies ahead this year. Ulster Bank, as a customer-focused bank, is very much here to help businesses future-proof their plans, manage risk and fulfil their ambitions. Richard Donnan is head of Northern Ireland for Ulster Bank. Full details on categories and criteria and how to enter are available at www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/business/news/business-awards.

The company had some successful commercials during the broadcast. PROCTER & GAMBLE Kia Motors America shows a scene from the company’s spot for Super Bowl 51, featuring Melissa McCarthy. KIA MOTORS AMERICA Share Tweet Share Email Comments Print NEW YORK — The New England Patriots defeated the Atlanta Falcons during a nailbiter in Super Bowl 51 — and there were clear winners and losers off the field too. Advertisers had to tread carefully this year in a divisive political climate. Some went for all out escapist humor like T-Mobile and Tide, while others tried to take a more serious tone like the American Petroleum Institute. With 30-second ads costing about $5 million, and more than 110 million people watching, it’s a huge gamble to advertise during the game even in a less politically charged atmosphere. And there were reactions, especially on social media, to some of the advertisements viewed as too political. Some supporters of President Trump quickly called for boycotts of several companies, including Budweiser, 84 Lumber, Coca-Cola, Airbnb, Kia, and Tiffany. Their ads had messages about immigration, equality, and environmentalism. Of all of the ads, here are the winners and losers.   ● Winner: Tide. Procter & Gamble’s Tide ad featuring announcer Terry Bradshaw seemed at first to be part of the game broadcast. But when he gets a stain on his T-shirt, he goes on an adventure featuring New England Patriot Rob Gronkowski and actor Jeffrey Tambor to try to find a clean T-shirt. “It was just from the writing to the casting pure fun,” said Mark DiMassimo, CEO of ad agency DiMassimo Goldstein. ● Winner: Kia. Kia managed to touch on social issues without offending people by tapping Melissa McCarthy to take on causes like saving whales, ice caps, and trees, each time to disastrous effect. Kia’s 60-second third-quarter ad promotes the fuel efficiency of its 2017 Niro car. ● Winner: Budweiser. Budweiser managed to capture the pre-game buzz with its “Born the Hard Way” spot. The cinematic 60-second spot chronicles co-founder Adolphus Busch’s journey from Germany to St. Louis in 1857. He jumps off a burning steamboat and catches a glimpse of Budweiser’s iconic Clydesdales mascots before meeting fellow immigrant Eberhard Anheuser. Some people took to Twitter to protest the immigration theme of the ad, but the ad was still one of the most watched ads ahead of the game. ● Winner: T-Mobile. The wireless carrier made a big splash during the game by buying up 3 minutes of airtime and stuffing its ads with celebrities. In one ad, Snoop Dogg and Martha Stewart discuss T-Mobile’s unlimited data plan with lots of innuendo about Snoop’s pot-smoking habit. Kristen Schaal starred in two other ad parodies of 50 Shades of Grey that implied having a Verizon plan is like being punished — sadistic and masochistic. ● Loser: Febreze. P&G’s ad sought to take a humorous approach to saluting the well-known halftime bathroom break. “I love you halftime bathroom break,” says actress Kathryn Hahn during the commercial. But not everyone found the “potty humor” appealing. ● Loser: Snickers. Snicker’s hyped up its live ad in the third quarter. The ad, set on a Wild West set, started with actor Adam Driver talking about the 21-3 score to prove it was live. But then things seem to go wrong and the set falls apart — on purpose. “You ruin live Super Bowl commercials when you’re hungry,” the copy reads on screen. “It went by so fast, I almost missed it,” Mr. DiMassimo said. “I think the audience got it [but I’m] not sure it was worth the trouble of doing it live.” ● Loser: Wendy’s. Wendy’s sought to emphasize its message of “Always fresh, never frozen” in its ad which showed a meatlocker full of frozen beef and a worker trying to thaw it with a hair dryer to the tune of Foreigner’s “Cold as Ice.”  Ad critic Barbara Lippert says the ad is unappetizing. “All it does is leave you hearing frozen, frozen, frozen,” she noted.

Screen Rant You Are Reading: The Best Super Bowl Commercials Of 2017 Share On Facebook Comments (18) Next Follow Us Follow @screenrant SR EXCLUSIVES MOVIE NEWS TV NEWS REVIEWS VIDEOS LISTS + TRAILERS PODCASTS TOP MOVIES Comics Gaming Up Next 57 Shares ShareOn Facebook Tweet Share Email Share Share Pin It Share Comment The Best Super Bowl Commercials Of 2017 By Matthew Dello Russo 02.06.2017 18 Comments 57 Shares ShareOn Facebook Tweet Share Email Share Share Pin It Share Comment The big game — and what a game it was — is in the books, but the Best Ad competition is just getting started. Companies like Skittles, Audi, Frito-Lay, and Budweiser shelled out a record-setting $5.02 million just to secure a 30-second spot during the Super Bowl, which is nearly double the price tag from 2010. Think about that for a minute. The cost for 30 seconds of advertising actually exceeded the yearly salary for most players in the game, as only 14 players crossed the $5 million salary mark in 2016 (per Spotrac). As viewers know, car and beer companies weren’t the only ones grabbing up air time this year; we were also treated to several awesome trailers and sneak peaks from big names like Stranger Things, Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy, Hulu’s The Handmaid’s Tale, Transformers, The Walking Dead, and many more. These first looks, coupled with loads of clever commercials, made for quite the distraction from the game itself. That’s probably a good thing, as we’re betting the residents of Georgia might need a few distractions in the days to come. Outside of all the trailers, however, we were gifted with a solid crop of memorable advertisements from outside the film and TV industry. With honorable mentions going out to Tide for Gronk’s Cleaner, Skittles for their Romance ad, and Febreeze’s Bathroom Break, here are The Best Super Bowl Commercials Of 2017. Dishonorable Mention: Wonderful Pistachios – Treadmill We get it — slapstick humor tends to do pretty well with sports fans. We’re just a bunch of beer-swilling cavemen, right? Wrong. Sort of. While most of us enjoy Charlie Chaplin-esque humor from time to time, we take our Super Bowl ads quite seriously. So seriously, in fact, that the Pistachios commercial feels like an insult to our intelligence. That’s saying a lot, by the way; we eat, sleep, and breathe pop-culture, and not all of what we write about is terribly high-brow. But a talking elephant, on a treadmill? He’s not even running on all four legs like a real elephant. Why would this elephant need to lose weight? His only job is to be gigantic and use that strangely-dexterous, clearly sentient trunk of his to perform amazing feats. ALSO, elephants eat peanuts, not pistachios. Leap in logic notwithstanding, Wonderful just spent $166,666 per second for this awful spot. Nice work, lads. Dishonorable Mention: Sprint – Daddy’s Dead Imagine the pitch meeting for this commercial. Creative lead walks in, draws a family watching as a car falls off a cliff and bursts into fiery flames. Creative lead turns to the client, smiling. Big important client person says, “Nope. All wrong.” Creative lead looks to the drawing, back to the client, again to the drawing. He nods. “You’re absolutely right,” he says. “The flames are too much.” Sprint’s commercial, which makes light of the drastic measures customers take to leave their Verizon contract behind, inexplicably aired multiple times during the big game. The slightly extended version of the ad that was released after the game isn’t a whole lot better. Dark humor is great — and the fact that Verizon’s Can You Hear Me Now guy works for Sprint these days is even greater – but the whole “Daddy’s dead” thing is too try-hard for our liking. Cell company ads were definitely not a strength of this year’s Super Bowl. 13. Squarespace – Who is John Malkovich The legendary John Malkovich is comically perplexed in Squarespace’s 2017 Super Bowl spot, “Who is John Malkovich?” The 60-second ad makes all the right moves as it lands squarely at the intersection of comedy and reality, and John is his absolutely terrific best all the way through. Squarespace — an all-in-one publishing tools company — is urging viewers to get their own web domain and avoid the fate of poor Mr. Malkovich. Hunched over his laptop, he wonders aloud, “How is it that John Malkovich.com is taken?” John is trying to buy a domain for his new clothing line (this is a real thing, by the way; he’s designing clothes now), and it seems like someone has beaten him to the punch. “But I’m him,” he utters in frustration. “There’s a film about me being me.” While some Super Bowl Sunday ads aim for belly laughs, Squarespace’s witty, dry entry goes entirely deadpan to get its point across while cleverly working in a Being John Malkovich reference that Spike Jonze fans are sure to love. Watching Malkovich quickly descend into burning rage is priceless. 12. Devour Frozen Meals – The Audition Devour, the creator of obscenely tasty frozen meals, got all our motors running with their saucy 30-second ad, titled “The Audition.” Like a train wreck, we can’t seem to look away from Devour’s commercial; after just one bite of Devour Mac ‘n Cheese, Regular Joe transforms into a love machine. He drives all the casting agents wild, and Devour hits us with the least subtle motto of the century: Food You Want to Fork. Think you’ve got what it takes to outdo that guy? If so, Devour is holding an open casting call on January 10th for male actors, non-actors, and “oddballs” between the ages of 25 to 42 to star in their next commercial. The individual who lands the role will be compensated $100,000 to work on the new ad spot, which is set to shoot January 14th–18th. We’re expecting America Idol-esque lines for this one, as open casting calls tend to bring out the crazies. Imagine who’ll show up for their shot at $100 grand! *Abandons desk, drives to Glendale for audition* 11. Buick – Not So Pee Wee Football Buick’s Super Bowl spot is an easy target for the haters (especially on Twitter). Set during a pee-wee football game, the ad has a little kid transforming into Cam Newton and then dominating the rest of the field. His performance in the spot is a vast improvement from last year’s Super Bowl, where Newton was absolutely trounced by Von Miller and the rest of the Denver Bronco’s D in the actual game. Buick’s ad is actually a bit ironic; last year, Newton and the Panthers offense looked like a Pop Warner team playing against a grown men. It looks like Newton learned his lesson – and how to pick his opponents more wisely. Besides Cam, the commercial also stars the gorgeous Miranda Kerr and a few much less attractive Buicks. The 60-second spot ran during the first quarter of the big game, and marks the second consecutive Super Bowl ad for Buick. The internet has had an absolute field day with this one, but we love it all the same. 10. Wix – The Restaurant Ever wonder what happens when you put Wonder Woman and the Transporter together in one Super Bowl spot? Wonder no more, friends, as the creative minds at Wix have finally answered that question with their 30-second ad. Wix has pulled out all the stops for their big game ads the last three years, and this one – starring Gal Gadot and Jason Statham and directed by Louis Leterrier (Brothers Grimsby, Now You See Me) – plays more like a shoot-em-up than a commercial intended to hype up a website building platform. Getting to watch Gadot and Statham punch faces together is a dream come true for action fans. The duo makes beating up fifteen bad guys look easy (and sexy) and even helps Chef Felix renovate his restaurant space. There’s a two-minute directors cut available online, though viewers were only treated to the 30-second version during Sunday’s game. We can’t wait to see what Wix dreams up for next year’s Super Bowl. 9. Evony – The King’s Return Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Aaron Eckhart star in the most epic ad of the century, Evony’s “The King’s Return”. The mobile game company promised a masterpiece and they did not disappoint. The jaw-dropping ad tells the story of monumental battles throughout history, jumping from King Arthur to George Washington to Chinese Empress Wu Zetian. While the company only secured a 30-second slot for the Super Bowl, the actual extended cut is a two-minute trailer for the most epic movie we could ever wish for. Honestly, we were kinda disappointed when we found out that this wasn’t a sneak peak of what’s to come on The Walking Dead. Can you imagine if Negan went all King Arthur on some walkers? If you’ve never jumped into the mobile gaming world, now might be the time to start. Hopefully, Evony’s game is as entertaining as their Super Bowl spot. Maybe even half as entertaining. If the game doesn’t pan out, at least they can rest easy knowing their commercial was better than Damon’s The Great Wall. 8. Honda – Yearbook We all had awkward teenage years. Maybe it was braces, maybe it was a wardrobe comprised entirely of velour jumpsuits. Either way, photographic evidence of these years generally tends to wind up buried in a box somewhere at mom’s house – unless you’re a super-duper famous person, that is. Then it gets broadcasted to the entire world. Honda’s charming and lighthearted spot brings yearbook photos to life, tabbing some very A-list celebrities for their cast. Tina Fey thought bringing a red rose to picture day would be a nice touch. Amy Adams had a severe case of bangs-in-the-face. And Jimmy Kimmel, always the joker, laments his outfit while encouraging kids to follow their dreams. The rest of the cast includes big names like Steve Carell, Viola Davis, Missy Elliott, Magic Johnson, Stan Lee, and Robert Redford. The hilarious spot, part of Honda’s latest “Power of Dreams” campaign, plugs the CR-V’s 20th anniversary with a clever yearbook entry of its own. 7. Mr. Clean – Cleaner of Your Dreams Proctor & Gamble’s iconic character just got his first-ever Super Bowl ad, and boy does he make cleaning look good. The 30-second ad features a slightly updated version of the beloved Mr. Clean. He’s still rocking the bald head and all, but he looks about ten years younger and ten hundred times sexier. Yes, it’s just as strange for us to call him sexy as it is for you to read it. Now we’ve seen everything. Aptly named “Cleaner of Your Dreams,” the mostly dialogue-free commercial has Mr. Clean showing up for duty at Sarah’s house in his signature skin-tight white pants and T-shirt, swinging his hips and sashaying away as he cleans the kitchen, bathroom, and living room. The musical score isn’t subtle, and we’re basically watching Mr. Clean transform into Mr. Steal Yo’ Girlfriend with every passing second. Hey, the creative minds at Proctor & Gamble aren’t wrong: “You gotta love a man who cleans.” 6. Snickers – Live with Kylo Ren Snickers teamed up with Star Wars supervillain Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) to deliver a spectacular 30-second live commercial. The western-themed ad keeps with the “you’re not you when you’re hungry” message, with intentionally poor timing and an extremely flimsy set. The motto was replaced with “You ruin live Super Bowl commercials when you’re hungry” at the end of the spot. This morning, Snickers kept the ball rolling with a somber statement: “Hunger was the root cause of an off the field fumble during the Snickers live Super Bowl LI commercial last night as Adam Driver missed his mark to begin the spot. The mishap demonstrated once more the effects of what can happen when you’re hungry and off your game.” Driver, playing a gunslinger by the name of Jeremiah, clearly didn’t have his morning Snickers before heading to set. The same could be said about the Atlanta Falcons at halftime, but that’s neither here nor there. 5. Hyundai – Live with U.S. Troops Here’s a first: Hyundai selected director Peter Berg (Patriots Day, Deepwater Horizon) to shoot its Super Bowl ad during the game. The emotional spot opens with a helicopter buzzing over a US military outpost in Poland, stating that Americans wouldn’t be free to watch and enjoy the game without its troops serving around the world. Soldiers are shown watching the game on base, and several are selected from the group and taken back to a smaller, more private room. These soldiers are given the gift of a lifetime: thanks to cutting-edge 360-degree cameras placed inside NRG stadium in Houston, they get to “attend” the game with their loved ones from thousands of miles away. Hyundai really nailed it with this one. They didn’t show a single car throughout the entire ad, they gave back to our troops, and they reminded viewers of what should really matter to each and every one of us: family, friends, and loved ones. 4. Kia – Hero’s Journey Kia went all in with their epic Super Bowl ad for the new Kia Niro hybrid, which pays tribute to environmentalism and eco-activists. Award-winning actress Melissa McCarthy (Ghostbusters, Bridesmaids) plays a never-say-no eco-warrior attempting to save the planet, one cause at a time. McCarthy battles illegal whalers, the evil corporations behind deforestation, and polar ice caps, basically dying a million deaths along the way (not really, but a normal human would be super dead). McCarthy is indefatigable, even going to bat for the nearly extinct rhinos of our planet. Kia was the first automaker of 2017 to announce their plans for a Super Bowl commercial, buying a full 60-second spot for just a shade over $5 million. Kia’s decision to lean on McCarthy’s star power was a good one, as this spot still has us laughing a full day after the game. She’s white-hot right now; if you somehow missed it, you need to see her Sean Spicer bit on SNL. It’s magic. 3. Audi – Daughter Audi’s full 60-second spot is the commercial we need for 2017. Ditching the whole “fast car, tight turns” narrative that luxury/performance car companies beat to death every year, the creative minds at Audi have thrown themselves into the political fray with their spot about gender equality. The score is fantastic, the voiceover is perfect, and watching that adorable little girl dominate the field in her soapbox racer has us feeling all the feels. Republican, Democrat, Tea Party – it doesn’t matter. While our country clashes over political and religious ideals, commercials like Audi’s “Daughter” serve as a reminder that at the end of the day, we are all still human. If our math is correct, the company spent $10.04 million to secure a full 60-second spot in the third quarter. We feel like this ad was actually worth the investment, as it sends a powerful and relevant message to the citizens of the world: gender bias is officially a thing of the past. 2. Avocados from Mexico – #AvoSecrets Holy Guacamole! Avocados From Mexico just changed the game with their revelationary Super Bowl commercial, which marks the brand’s third consecutive year of big game advertising. Some of the best snippets from the full 100-second spot (which has been pared down to 30 seconds for the game) include: Big Foot isn’t real (or is he, Scott?), there are actually only 49 shades of grey, and Area 51 (and 52-54) are still safe from the public. The ad’s initially-masked secret society can’t seem to keep its secrets a secret; we’re guessing that has to do with Kyle live-streaming the meeting. The 100-second version also includes a quick shot from the recently released John Lovitz teaser, teaching the society just how effective subliminal messaging can really be. According to Advertising Age, the idea of “good” fat in avocados is a message that the brand will pushing hard in the coming months, as the FDA plans to reevaluate its stance on healthy fats vs total fat consumption. 1. Budweiser – Born the Hard Way The perennial Best Ad contender and beer giant has tapped into the recent immigration debate with “Born the Hard Way,” or as we like to call it, “The Commercial That Could Actually Start a Fight at Your Super Bowl Party.” Looks like they don’t need cuddly puppies, throaty bullfrogs, or majestic Clydesdales to create memorable ads anymore. Budweiser’s departure from familiar territory is refreshing, and the ad itself – which challenges the current stance of certain White House figureheads – is a stiff shot of patriotism when we need it most. Available online well before Sunday’s Super Bowl broadcast, “Born the Hard Way” is less a 60-second spot and more of a 60-second story. It showcases the plight of Adolphus Busch, a brewmaster from Germany who discards his former life and journeys to America in the mid-1800s. Treated with contempt and ridiculed from day one, Busch overcomes tremendous adversity as he makes his way to St. Louis, where he meets Eberhard Anheuser, another immigrant, and changes the global beer landscape forever. — What was your favorite ad from Super Bowl Sunday?

Last month dozens of leading global brands endorsed a plan to ensure 70 percent of plastic packaging is reused and recycled globally, up from today’s recycling rate of 14 percent. They include Coca-Cola, Danone, Dow Chemical, L’Oreal, Marks & Spencer, Mars, PepsiCo, Procter & Gamble and Unilever. The plan to achieve a 70 percent plastic packaging recycling rate is laid out in a new report, The New Plastics Economy: Catalysing action, by the World Economic Forum and the Ellen MacArthur Foundation. The report recommends companies “actively explore” replacing polystyrene (PS), expanded polystyrene (EPS), and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) as packaging materials. This year, As You Sow filed a shareholder proposal with McDonald’s, which phased out foam beverage cups in the US but continues to use it in foreign markets. Dunkin’ Brands has committed to phase out foam cups, but has not yet done so, the nonprofit says. It also filed similar resolutions with Amazon and Target, and says it is in dialogue with Walmart, which uses polystyrene foam as packing material in its e-commerce operations. The proposals urge the companies to assess the environmental impacts of continued use and to develop a timeline for phase out. “We are aware of the campaign and are in the process of evaluating, but don’t have additional details to share at this time,” Target spokesperson Angie Thompson said in an email. The other three companies did not respond to requests for comment. More than 100 US cities or counties have already banned or restricted foam packaging and Ikea and Dell are among the companies to being phasing out foam packaging in their e-commerce operations. Ikea, however, has drawn sharp criticism from the plastics industry for phasing out foam and replacing it with fiber-based packaging. Ikea said it had replaced all EPS foam in its packaging “with recyclable and more sustainable alternatives.” In a joint statement the US-based EPS Industry Alliance and the Belgium-based European Manufacturers of EPS accused Ikea of greenwashing and said the retail giant “merely relied on the public perception that paper is uniformly a superior environmental choice.” Categories WasteTags Amazon, As You Sow, Dell, IKEA, McDonald's, Plastics, polystyrene, rwrr, shareholder resolutions, Sustainable Packaging & Paper, Target, Walmart Leave a Comment Cancel reply NEWSLETTER NEWSLETTER SIGNUP Join 100,000+ subscribers who gain a competitive advantage with our news and analysis.

Snapchat has nine board members, and they're all male—with the exception of Coles. Five of the nine are paid. Coles earned $110,866 last year in her role. But the next-lowest-paid directors received nearly $1.1 million, Fortune reports. Pinterest Facebook Joanna Coles PHOTO: Maarten de Boer/NBC/Getty To add insult to financial injury, Coles also has the lowest number of shares in Snapchat among its board members. (That's part of why her compensation is so much lower.) She was awarded 7,488 shares for 2016, while Snapchat's highest-paid director, former P&G chairman A.G. Lafley, received 162,762 shares worth about $2.5 million last year. According to Fortune, Snap Inc., the parent company of Snapchat, declined to comment on why Coles earns so much less than her male peers or why its board lacks diversity. Unfortunately, Snapchat is hardly the only company paying its female board members less than its male board members. Fortune cites a recent study that shows women and minority directors are paid about 3 to 9 percent less than their white male counterparts. And a separate recent study reveals that beyond the boardroom, women in a variety of managerial roles make about 17 percent less than their male peers. What is different about Snapchat is just how male its board is. A recent Redfin report shows that 80 percent of members at the 100 technology companies to most recently file for an IPO were male, leaving 20 percent of board seats to women. Again, Coles is the only woman on the nine-member board of directors at Snapchat. Coles has yet to publicly comment on the filing's financial revelations.

So which brands "won" 2017's biggest U.S. sporting event? Analytics company iSpot.tv looked at digital share of voice; social actions such as tweets, shares and mentions; and the number of times an ad had been viewed online. It also looked at TV ad impressions and media spend. Here are the top 10 best performing Super Bowl ads of 2017. 1. Budweiser - Born the Hard Way Beer brand Budweiser's ad features founder Adolphus Busch migrating to the U.S. to fulfill his dream of brewing beer, and while he is initially told, "Go back home," he is shown escaping from a burning ship and forging his way through torrential rain and mud to a bar where he is finally welcomed. The ad clocked up more than 32 million online views, and 79 million TV impressions, against an ad spend of $9.8 million, according to iSpot.tv's estimates. 2. Mr. Clean – Cleaner of Your Dreams Procter & Gamble's "Cleaner of Your Dreams" ad featuring an all-white CGI Mr. Clean character has been watched more than 19 million times online, and gained more than 74 million TV impressions against an estimated spend of $5.4 million, according to iSpot.tv. 3. Netflix – Stranger Things Season Two: 1984 Netflix has put an estimated $5.3 million in TV ad spend behind its Super Bowl ad for the second season of horror series "Stranger Things," which will be aired this coming Halloween. The ad got 69 million TV ad impressions and more than 17 million online views according to iSpot.tv. 4. T-Mobile - Unlimited Moves The mobile network's spot features Justin Bieber encouraging people to post their favorite dance moves online. "T-Mobile really presented Justin Bieber in a beneficial way for Bieber's brand. They were on-point with their message in what their product would provide," Rick Burton, David B. Falk Endowed Professor of Sport Management, Syracuse University, told CNBC.com via email. T-Mobile spent around $10 million on airing the spot, according to iSpot.tv's estimates, and the ad has been watched more than 15 million times online, with almost 70 million TV ad impressions. 5. Wix.com – Chez Feliz British actor Jason Statham and "Wonder Woman" star Gal Gadot appear in Wix.com's ad featuring a fight in a restaurant and an oblivious chef. An estimated TV spend of $6.5 million has helped the brand to more than 85 million TV ad impressions and nearly 34 million online views. 6. Audi - Daughter Audi's ad campaigns for equal pay for equal work, in an ad that shows a young girl competing in a go-kart race while her father ponders "What shall I tell my daughter?" Aoife McArdle directed the spot for Venables Bell & Partners and the ad has been seen more than 11 million times online, and received nearly 75 million TV ad impressions, against an estimated spend of $10.5 million. 7. Mercedes - Easy Driver The "Easy Rider"–inspired spot has been watched more than 24 million times on YouTube, and had an estimated TV ad spend of $5.33 million. The Coen brothers'–directed Mercedes commercial for its AMG GT Roadster features actor Peter Fonda, and TV ad impressions have reached nearly 67 million. 8. 84 Lumber - The Journey Begins Immigration has been a theme of this year's Super Bowl advertising campaigns, with Airbnb using its spot to put across a welcoming message. Meanwhile, building supplies company 84 Lumber has used its ad to show a mother and daughter traveling from Mexico to the U.S., encountering a wall between the two countries. It has been watched more than 7 million times online, according to iSpot.tv, with a five-minute version being published Sunday. It spent an estimated $15 million on media, and received more than 81 million TV ad impressions. 9. Buick – Not So Pee Wee Football Buick's ad stars quarterback Cam Newton taking out children playing football in this comedy spot aiming to change expectations of the car brand. The commercial, which also features model Miranda Kerr, has been seen nearly 12 million times online, and iSpot.tv estimates the brands spent nearly $10.5 million on media. TV ad impressions are currently more than 65 million. 10. Nintendo - Switch The gaming brand advertises its portable Switch console being played as a standalone device as well as slotting into a home TV, to the soundtrack of "Believer" by Las Vegas band Imagine Dragons.

Advertisers had to tread carefully this year in a divisive political climate. Some went for all out escapist humour like T-Mobile and Tide, while others tried to take a more serious tone like the American Petroleum Institute. With 30-second ads costing around $5 million, and more than 110 million people watching, it's a huge gamble to advertise during the game even in a less politically charged atmosphere. Here are the winners whose gamble paid off, and losers who struck the wrong tone. Winner: TIDE P&G's Tide ad featuring announcer Terry Bradshaw seemed at first to be part of the game broadcast. But when Bradshaw gets a stain on his shirt, he goes on an adventure featuring New England Patriot Rob Gronkowski and actor Jeffrey Tambor to try to find a clean shirt. "It was just from the writing to the casting pure fun," said Mark DiMassimo, CEO of ad agency DiMassimo Goldstein. Winner: KIA Kia managed to touch on social issues without offending people by tapping Melissa McCarthy to take on causes like saving whales, ice caps and trees, each time to disastrous effect. Kia's 60-second third-quarter ad promotes the fuel efficiency of its 2017 Niro car. Winner: NFL Two NFL ads aimed to appeal to all. The first ad , "Inside These Lines," narrated by Forest Whitaker, showed scenes of football games and workers prepping a field. The narration stated: "Inside these lines, we may have our differences, but recognize there is more that unites us." Another ad showed Super Bowl babies resembling NFL stars like Chicago Bears coach Mike Ditka and former Seattle Seahawks running back Marshawn Lynch to the tune of Chicago's "You're the Inspiration." Winner: Budweiser Budweiser managed to capture the pre-game buzz with its "Born the Hard Way" spot. The cinematic 60-second spot chronicles co-founder Adolphus Busch's journey from Germany to St. Louis in 1857. He jumps off a burning steamboat and catches a glimpse of Budweiser's iconic Clydesdales mascots before meeting fellow immigrant Eberhard Anheuser. Some people took to Twitter to protest the immigration theme of the ad, but the ad was still one of the most watched ads ahead of the game. Winner: T-Mobile The wireless carrier made a big splash during the game by buying up 3 minutes of airtime and stuffing its ads with celebrities. In one ad , Snoop Dogg and Martha Stewart discuss T-Mobile's unlimted data plan with lots of innuendo about Snoop's pot-smoking habit. Kristen Schaal started in two other adparodies of "50 Shades of Grey" that implied having a Verizon plan is like being punished – ” S&M style. And Justin Bieber and New England Patriots' Rob Gronkowski danced in another ad for the brand. Loser: American Petroleum Institutions An ad by a trade group sought to rebrand oil's image, opening with the line that "This ain't your daddy's oil." The ad showed a series of colorful ways oil is allegedly used, including in spray paint and makeup. It said the "oil pumps life," ''oil runs cleaner" and "oil explores space" â€” unexpected phrases for many that drew some mockery on social media. The American Petroleum Institute says on its website that it represents the oil and natural gas industry, including producers, refiners, suppliers and pipeline operators. Villanova University marketing professor Charles Taylor said its message didn't get across. "They're trying to somehow emphasize environmentalism, but I don't think they did it in a way that most consumers would find believable," he said. Loser: Febreeze P&G's ad sought to take a humorous approach to saluting the well-known halftime bathroom break. "I love you halftime bathroom break," says actress Kathryn Hahn during the commercial. But not everyone found the "potty humour" appealing. Loser: Snickers Snicker's hyped up its live ad in the third quarter. The ad, set on a Wild West set, started with actor Adam Driver talking about the 21-3 score to prove it was live. But then things seem to go wrong and the set falls apart – on purpose. "You ruin live Super Bowl commercials when you're hungry," the copy reads on screen. "It went by so fast, I almost missed it," said DiMassimo Goldstein CEO Mark DiMassimo. "I think the audience got it (but I'm) not sure it was worth the trouble of doing it live." Loser: Wendy's Wendy's sought to emphasize its message of "Always fresh, never frozen" in its ad which showed a meatlocker full of frozen beef and a worker trying to thaw it with a hair dryer to the tune of Foreigner's "Cold as Ice." Ad critic Barbara Lippert says the ad is unappetizing. "All it does is leave you hearing frozen, frozen, frozen," she noted.   Mae Anderson, The Associated Press We encourage an open exchange of ideas on this story's topic, but we ask you to follow our guidelines for respecting community standards.

Advertisers had to tread carefully this year in a divisive political climate. Some went for all out escapist humour like T-Mobile and Tide, while others tried to take a more serious tone like the American Petroleum Institute. With 30-second ads costing around $5 million, and more than 110 million people watching, it's a huge gamble to advertise during the game even in a less politically charged atmosphere. Here are the winners whose gamble paid off, and losers who struck the wrong tone. Winner: TIDE P&G's Tide ad featuring announcer Terry Bradshaw seemed at first to be part of the game broadcast. But when Bradshaw gets a stain on his shirt, he goes on an adventure featuring New England Patriot Rob Gronkowski and actor Jeffrey Tambor to try to find a clean shirt. "It was just from the writing to the casting pure fun," said Mark DiMassimo, CEO of ad agency DiMassimo Goldstein. Winner: KIA Kia managed to touch on social issues without offending people by tapping Melissa McCarthy to take on causes like saving whales, ice caps and trees, each time to disastrous effect. Kia's 60-second third-quarter ad promotes the fuel efficiency of its 2017 Niro car. Winner: NFL Two NFL ads aimed to appeal to all. The first ad , "Inside These Lines," narrated by Forest Whitaker, showed scenes of football games and workers prepping a field. The narration stated: "Inside these lines, we may have our differences, but recognize there is more that unites us." Another ad showed Super Bowl babies resembling NFL stars like Chicago Bears coach Mike Ditka and former Seattle Seahawks running back Marshawn Lynch to the tune of Chicago's "You're the Inspiration." Winner: Budweiser Budweiser managed to capture the pre-game buzz with its "Born the Hard Way" spot. The cinematic 60-second spot chronicles co-founder Adolphus Busch's journey from Germany to St. Louis in 1857. He jumps off a burning steamboat and catches a glimpse of Budweiser's iconic Clydesdales mascots before meeting fellow immigrant Eberhard Anheuser. Some people took to Twitter to protest the immigration theme of the ad, but the ad was still one of the most watched ads ahead of the game. Winner: T-Mobile The wireless carrier made a big splash during the game by buying up 3 minutes of airtime and stuffing its ads with celebrities. In one ad , Snoop Dogg and Martha Stewart discuss T-Mobile's unlimted data plan with lots of innuendo about Snoop's pot-smoking habit. Kristen Schaal started in two other adparodies of "50 Shades of Grey" that implied having a Verizon plan is like being punished – ” S&M style. And Justin Bieber and New England Patriots' Rob Gronkowski danced in another ad for the brand. Loser: American Petroleum Institutions An ad by a trade group sought to rebrand oil's image, opening with the line that "This ain't your daddy's oil." The ad showed a series of colorful ways oil is allegedly used, including in spray paint and makeup. It said the "oil pumps life," ''oil runs cleaner" and "oil explores space" â€” unexpected phrases for many that drew some mockery on social media. The American Petroleum Institute says on its website that it represents the oil and natural gas industry, including producers, refiners, suppliers and pipeline operators. Villanova University marketing professor Charles Taylor said its message didn't get across. "They're trying to somehow emphasize environmentalism, but I don't think they did it in a way that most consumers would find believable," he said. Loser: Febreeze P&G's ad sought to take a humorous approach to saluting the well-known halftime bathroom break. "I love you halftime bathroom break," says actress Kathryn Hahn during the commercial. But not everyone found the "potty humour" appealing. Loser: Snickers Snicker's hyped up its live ad in the third quarter. The ad, set on a Wild West set, started with actor Adam Driver talking about the 21-3 score to prove it was live. But then things seem to go wrong and the set falls apart – on purpose.

ChartsValuation & Peer ComparisonCommunity Buzz Close ✕ Panneerselvam vs Sasikala: Who will lead Jayalalithaa's party? Track the turmoil in Tamil Nadu here By Tim Baysinger NEW YORK (Reuters) - With Americans' attention more finely tuned to the political climate under U.S. President Donald Trump, brands that dove headfirst into that conversation generated the most reaction from viewers during Sunday's Super Bowl. For much of the evening, the chatter around commercials by AirBnB Inc, Coca Cola Co and Budweiser was more exciting than the Super Bowl itself. That changed late in the game, the New England Patriots pulled off a 25-point comeback to defeat the Atlanta Falcons in the National Football League's first-ever overtime Super Bowl. With the thrilling finish, viewers could exceed the 114.4 million who watched Super Bowl XLIX in 2015, providing a massive audience for advertisers who paid more than $5 million for 30 seconds of air time. A teaser for the second season of Netflix Inc's hit show "Stranger Things," as well as celebrity-studded and humorous ads from T-Mobile US Inc and Proctor & Gamble Co's Mr. Clean, drew the most attention on social media. Still, brands such as AirBnB, that leaned into subjects of diversity and immigration, by and large sparked the most conversation among viewers. The company's ad, featuring a diverse group of employees touting a message of acceptance, will be seen by many as a criticism of Trump's immigration policies. AirBnB was one of the last to buy a Super Bowl spot; co-founder Brian Chesky wrote on Twitter they purchased and shot the ad last Thursday. The commercial was among the most discussed by viewers, generating nearly 78,000 tweets between 6:30 p.m. and 11 p.m. EST, data from digital marketing technology company Amobee shows. During the pre-game, Coca Cola re-aired its ad from the 2014 Super Bowl, which featured "America the Beautiful" sung in different languages, which prompted more than 74,000 tweets. Budweiser's spot, telling the story of Anheuser-Busch's immigrant co-founder Adolphus Busch, and Pennsylvania-based building materials company 84 Lumber Co's ad were among the most talked about as well. 84 Lumber's commercial had to be reworked after Fox rejected an initial version that featured a border wall, which was in the company's full-length online version. Amobee data found the sentiment for the ads skewed positive. Advertisers have been grappling with how to reach consumers in the political climate under Trump, when viewers' increasingly partisan attitudes make it more difficult to market to a broad audience. "It's America paying attention to us and really ranking us, when they so often try to ignore what advertising does," said Ted Royer, chief creative officer of creative agency Droga5, which created Sprint Corp's ad targeting rival carrier Verizon Communications Inc. Trump's November election, and his subsequent action on immigration and other issues has nearly split the population. That divide has left the stakes higher for advertisers devising campaigns for some of the biggest U.S. brands, which typically avoid politics, for fear of upsetting consumers. "There's a lot more anxiety, self-inflicted anxiety, in the country than there has been ever in the past," said Mike Sheldon, chairman and chief executive of ad agency Deutsch, who created Busch's first-ever Super Bowl ad.

For much of the evening, the chatter around commercials by Airbnb, Coca Cola Co and Budweiser was more exciting than the Super Bowl itself. That changed late in the game, the New England Patriots pulled off a 25-point comeback to defeat the Atlanta Falcons in the National Football League’s first-ever overtime Super Bowl. With the thrilling finish, viewers could exceed the 114.4 million who watched Super Bowl XLIX in 2015, providing a massive audience for advertisers who paid more than $5 million for 30 seconds of airtime. A teaser for the second season of Netflix’s hit show “Stranger Things,” as well as celebrity-studded and humorous ads from T-Mobile and Proctor & Gamble’s Mr. Clean, drew the most attention on social media. Still, brands such as Airbnb, that leaned into subjects of diversity and immigration, by and large sparked the most conversation among viewers. The company’s ad, featuring a diverse group of employees touting a message of acceptance, will be seen by many as a criticism of Trump’s immigration policies. Airbnb was one of the last to buy a Super Bowl spot; co-founder Brian Chesky wrote on Twitter they purchased and shot the ad last Thursday. The commercial was among the most discussed by viewers, generating nearly 78,000 tweets between 6:30 p.m. and 11 p.m. EST, data from digital marketing technology company Amobee shows. During the pre-game, Coca Cola re-aired its ad from the 2014 Super Bowl, which featured “America the Beautiful” sung in different languages, which prompted more than 74,000 tweets. Budweiser’s spot, telling the story of Anheuser-Busch’s immigrant co-founder Adolphus Busch, and Pennsylvania-based building materials company 84 Lumber’s ad were among the most talked about as well. 84 Lumber’s commercial had to be reworked after Fox rejected an initial version that featured a border wall, which was in the company’s full-length online version. Amobee data found the sentiment for the ads skewed positive. Advertisers have been grappling with how to reach consumers in the political climate under Trump, when viewers’ increasingly partisan attitudes make it more difficult to market to a broad audience. “It’s America paying attention to us and really ranking us, when they so often try to ignore what advertising does,” said Ted Royer, chief creative officer of creative agency Droga5, which created Sprint’s ad targeting rival carrier Verizon. Trump’s November election, and his subsequent action on immigration and other issues has nearly split the population. That divide has left the stakes higher for advertisers devising campaigns for some of the biggest U.S. brands, which typically avoid politics, for fear of upsetting consumers.

Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 6 February 2017 by Military News Old Spice Introduces Hydro Wash Body Wash to Its Hardest Working Collection, Showering Guys with Ultra Superior Hydration, Cleansing Power and a Legendary New Scent CINCINNATI–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Old Spice, the manliest grooming brand on the planet, announces new Hydro Wash body wash, the brand’s latest legendary product innovation and newest addition to its Hardest Working Collection. Offering superior hydration with over 20% hydro-moisturizing complex, new Hydro Wash features a thicker and richer lather that delivers unparalleled performance for guys that demand more from their grooming products. Old Spice also introduces the manly new scent, Steel Courage, across the Hardest Working Collection. “We’re proud to support guys on their journey to legendary freshness with the launch of new Old Spice Hydro Wash body wash,” said Janine Miletic, Old Spice Brand Director at Procter & Gamble. “This new shower innovation combines ultra-superior hydration with our long-lasting, masculine Old Spice scents. Guys, you’re smellcome.” To celebrate the introduction of Hydro Wash, Old Spice brings back the Legendary Man, Axel Kiener, in a new integrated campaign entitled “Don’t Smell Yourself Short,” which encourages guys on their quest to legendary achievements. The new campaign was launched via Old Spice’s YouTube channel on February 1 and made its television debut during Super Bowl LI’s pre-game programming. The full creative campaign will begin airing on national TV on February 13. Developed by Wieden+ Kennedy (Portland), the series of over-the-top ads depict a global renaissance man who has more than his fair share of good looks and amazing stories of personal adventure: “Endless Quest” (:15) – Even if your journey takes you to the remotest and driest of deserts, thanks to Old Spice Hydro Wash, your skin will never go thirsty. You, however, will probably be thirsty and quite possibly in need of a sandwich. “Jungle Hero” (:60) – Some journeys define a man. But with Old Spice Odor Blocker, a man defines the journey. “Answers” (:30) – Even if a journey is just 30 seconds, it’s still #smellegendary. “Gorilla” (:15) – With Old Spice Steel Courage, sweat is far behind you. But how does a man know when he’s gone too far? Only time (and the fact that he is being carried like an old rolled-up carpet) will tell. “Middle Name” (:15) – Even under the toughest of interrogations, the answer remains the same: New Old Spice Steel Courage is the greatest smelling shampoo on the planet. In addition to the ads, Old Spice, “The Greatest Smell in the NFL,” introduced its next chapter of internationally-famed product infomercials guest-starring Super Bowl 50 MVP and Old Spice guy Von Miller. “Hydro Wash Infomercial” (:45) – Van Mueller, ably portrayed by NFL star and aspiring infomercial host Von Miller, joins America’s favorite TV pitchman Bob Giovanni to share the super-charged hydration and lasting scent of new Hydro Wash body wash in the first-ever commercial actually shot live in Death Valley.* (* may not have actually been shot live in Death Valley). New Hydro Wash Features “Dual Stream” Formulation New Hydro Wash features Old Spice’s proprietary “dual stream” formula, keeping moisturizers and cleansers separate so that the moisturizers don’t wash away with the lather before hydrating the skin. Hydro Wash’s thicker and richer lather means less product down the drain, resulting in a better overall shower experience that leaves skin feeling hydrated and clean. Hardest Working Collection Launches Manly New Scent In addition to the popular Pure Sport Plus and Live Wire scents, the Hardest Working Collection welcomes a new, long-lasting masculine scent – Steel Courage– to its line-up of body washes and most powerful anti-perspirants, Odor Blocker and Sweat Defense. NEW Steel Courage – Old Spice’s daring new scent combines the energizing top notes of pineapple and warm rum with a mid-note of intoxicating clove, crisp pepper and sage. Hints of sandalwood and warm amber add a balanced finish. Steel Courage is also available in Old Spice 2-in-1 shampoo and conditioner. Amped-Up Sweat Protection The Hardest Working Collection also delivers on legendary performance with Sweat Defense and Odor Blocker anti-perspirants, Old Spice’s two most powerful forms. Sweat Defense Anti-Perspirant/Deodorant – Sweat Defense soft solid anti-perspirant/deodorant is Old Spice’s ‘gold standard’ delivering “stronger and longer sweat protection” for all-day dryness. Old Spice Sweat Defense delivers a 66 percent sweat reduction and is turbocharged with Old Spice’s proprietary BCD technology to trap and lock away bad odors as they occur while releasing fresh, manly scent in its place. Odor Blocker Anti-Perspirant/Deodorant – Odor Blocker is Old Spice’s most powerful invisible solid anti-perspirant/ deodorant, delivering legendary performance through stronger and longer sweat protection than its other collections and a 50 percent increase in BCD odor fighting technology that only Old Spice can claim. The Old Spice Hardest Working Collection, including new Hydro Wash body wash (MSRP: $4.99; Pricing at the sole discretion of the retailer), is available nationwide at drugstores, food stores and mass merchandisers. For more information on new Hydro Wash, the Hardest Working Collection and full Old Spice grooming line-up, visit OldSpice.com. For more on legendary manliness, visit Twitter (@OldSpice), Facebook (Facebook.com/OldSpice), YouTube (YouTube.com/OldSpice), Instagram (oldspice) and Tumblr (oldspice).

Track the turmoil in Tamil Nadu here By Tim Baysinger NEW YORK (Reuters) - With Americans' attention more finely tuned to the political climate under U.S. President Donald Trump, brands that dove headfirst into that conversation generated the most reaction from viewers during Sunday's Super Bowl. For much of the evening, the chatter around commercials by Airbnb, Coca Cola Co and Budweiser was more exciting than the Super Bowl itself. That changed late in the game, the New England Patriots pulled off a 25-point comeback to defeat the Atlanta Falcons in the National Football League's first-ever overtime Super Bowl. With the thrilling finish, viewers could exceed the 114.4 million who watched Super Bowl XLIX in 2015, providing a massive audience for advertisers who paid more than $5 million for 30 seconds of airtime. A teaser for the second season of Netflix's hit show "Stranger Things," as well as celebrity-studded and humorous ads from T-Mobile and Proctor & Gamble's Mr. Clean, drew the most attention on social media.

That divide has left the stakes higher for advertisers devising campaigns for some of the biggest U.S. brands, which typically avoid politics, for fear of upsetting consumers. "There's a lot more anxiety, self-inflicted anxiety, in the country than there has been ever in the past," said Mike Sheldon, chairman and chief executive of ad agency Deutsch, who created Busch's first-ever Super Bowl ad.

Welsh Carson takes majority stake in Revel, Scott Betts replaces Falzone as CEO Posted Feb 6, 2017 by Ingrid Lunden (@ingridlunden) 0 SHARES Next Story Breaking into startups: Idalin Bobe’s journey from North Philly to ThoughtWorks After many months of speculation about a potential acquisition by IBM or private equity firms, today, finally some official news from point-of-sale payments company Revel Systems. The company announced that Welsh, Carson, Anderson and Stowe (WCAS) has led a large growth round in the company that will make it the company’s majority shareholder. Alongside that, the company’s co-founder Lisa Falzone has stepped down as CEO. She is getting replaced by Scott Betts, a former CEO of Global Cash Access who has also worked at First Data and Procter & Gamble. His appointment takes effect today. “I am very excited to join the Revel team and continue Lisa’s and Chris’ great work in building and delivering an outstanding solution and superior business value to our clients,” said Betts in a statement. We are asking Revel for more details about the size of this round — which was hinted at in this FTC filing in January, but without any financial details. (Revel would not comment on the filing at the time.) WCAS led Revel’s $100 million Series C in 2014 (when it was focused still on an IPO). Before this round announced today, Revel had raised $130 million in total. In 2015, at its last fundraise, the company was valued at around $540 million. It sounds like Falzone’s departure as CEO is directly linked to the investment and is a sign of how the PE firm — which focuses on tech and healthcare investments — is hoping to firm up the business either for a bigger tech exit, with potentially more details with large brands along the way. “During the past two years, Revel has driven significant product innovation, gained market traction in key industry verticals, recruited terrific talent to the Revel team, and demonstrated strong client traction and growth,” said Eric J. Lee, General Partner at WCAS, in a statement. “Revel’s founders have shown great vision and determination in building the Company. Looking forward, we believe that there is significant market potential for Revel’s leading cloud-based POS solution, and WCAS is excited to fund and catalyze this next phase of Revel’s growth and success.” We’re asking what role, if any, Falzone will take but it looks like she is exiting altogether. “Revel’s mission has always been to make business owners’ and operators’ lives easier and more efficient – spurring entrepreneurship and leading the industry with excellent features and functionality. Keeping customers and their success at the forefront will always be core to the organization,” she said in a statement. “Revel is on a great trajectory. Lisa and I look forward to watching the company grow and evolve,” added Chris Ciabarra, Revel’s other co-founder. Revel competes against companies like Square but also PayPal, First Data and many more in offering a point-of-sale solution that small and larger business owners can run from an iPad app — bypassing a lot of legacy and costly specialised equipment and necessary deals with a longer chain of banking partners. It targets restaurants, retailer and enterprises and also offers payroll, inventory and CRM services.

The New England Patriots face the Atlanta Falcons in Super Bowl 51, on Sunday, Feb. 5, 2017. (Procter & Gamble via AP) Posted: Monday, February 6, 2017 3:31 am Super Bowl ad winners: Tide, T-Mobile Associated Press | NEW YORK (AP) — The New England Patriots defeated the Atlanta Falcons during a nailbiter Super Bowl 51 — and there were clear winners and losers off the field, too. Advertisers had to tread carefully this year in a divisive political climate. Some went for all out escapist humor like T-Mobile and Tide, while others tried to take a more serious tone like the American Petroleum Institute. With 30-second ads costing around $5 million, and more than 110 million people watching, it's a huge gamble to advertise during the game even in a less politically charged atmosphere. Here are the winners whose gamble paid off, and losers who struck the wrong tone. WINNER: TIDE P&G's Tide ad featuring announcer Terry Bradshaw seemed at first to be part of the game broadcast. But when Bradshaw gets a stain on his shirt, he goes on an adventure featuring New England Patriot Rob Gronkowski and actor Jeffrey Tambor to try to find a clean shirt. "It was just from the writing to the casting pure fun," said Mark DiMassimo, CEO of ad agency DiMassimo Goldstein. WINNER: KIA Kia managed to touch on social issues without offending people by tapping Melissa McCarthy to take on causes like saving whales, ice caps and trees, each time to disastrous effect. Kia's 60-second third-quarter ad promotes the fuel efficiency of its 2017 Niro car. WINNER: NFL Two NFL ads aimed to appeal to all. The first ad , "Inside These Lines," narrated by Forest Whitaker, showed scenes of football games and workers prepping a field. The narration stated: "Inside these lines, we may have our differences, but recognize there is more that unites us." Another ad showed Super Bowl babies resembling NFL stars like Chicago Bears coach Mike Ditka and former Seattle Seahawks running back Marshawn Lynch to the tune of Chicago's "You're the Inspiration." WINNER: BUDWEISER Budweiser managed to capture the pre-game buzz with its "Born the Hard Way" spot. The cinematic 60-second spot chronicles co-founder Adolphus Busch's journey from Germany to St. Louis in 1857. He jumps off a burning steamboat and catches a glimpse of Budweiser's iconic Clydesdales mascots before meeting fellow immigrant Eberhard Anheuser. Some people took to Twitter to protest the immigration theme of the ad, but the ad was still one of the most watched ads ahead of the game. WINNER: T-MOBILE The wireless carrier made a big splash during the game by buying up 3 minutes of airtime and stuffing its ads with celebrities. In one ad , Snoop Dogg and Martha Stewart discuss T-Mobile's unlimted data plan with lots of innuendo about Snoop's pot-smoking habit. Kristen Schaal started in two other adparodies of "50 Shades of Grey" that implied having a Verizon plan is like being punished — S&M style. And Justin Bieber and New England Patriots' Rob Gronkowski danced in another ad for the brand. LOSER: AMERICAN PETROLEUM INSTITUTION An ad by a trade group sought to rebrand oil's image, opening with the line that "This ain't your daddy's oil." The ad showed a series of colorful ways oil is allegedly used, including in spray paint and makeup. It said the "oil pumps life," ''oil runs cleaner" and "oil explores space" — unexpected phrases for many that drew some mockery on social media. The American Petroleum Institute says on its website that it represents the oil and natural gas industry, including producers, refiners, suppliers and pipeline operators. Villanova University marketing professor Charles Taylor said its message didn't get across. "They're trying to somehow emphasize environmentalism, but I don't think they did it in a way that most consumers would find believable," he said. LOSER: FEBREZE P&G's ad sought to take a humorous approach to saluting the well-known halftime bathroom break. "I love you halftime bathroom break," says actress Kathryn Hahn during the commercial. But not everyone found the "potty humor" appealing. LOSER: SNICKERS Snicker's hyped up its live ad in the third quarter. The ad, set on a Wild West set, started with actor Adam Driver talking about the 21-3 score to prove it was live. But then things seem to go wrong and the set falls apart — on purpose. "You ruin live Super Bowl commercials when you're hungry," the copy reads on screen. "It went by so fast, I almost missed it," said DiMassimo Goldstein CEO Mark DiMassimo. "I think the audience got it (but I'm) not sure it was worth the trouble of doing it live." LOSER: WENDY'S Wendy's sought to emphasize its message of "Always fresh, never frozen" in its ad which showed a meatlocker full of frozen beef and a worker trying to thaw it with a hair dryer to the tune of Foreigner's "Cold as Ice." Ad critic Barbara Lippert says the ad is unappetizing. "All it does is leave you hearing frozen, frozen, frozen," she noted. © 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The New England Patriots face the Atlanta Falcons in Super Bowl 51, on Sunday, Feb. 5, 2017. (Procter & Gamble via AP) NEW YORK (AP) — The New England Patriots defeated the Atlanta Falcons during a nailbiter Super Bowl 51 — and there were clear winners and losers off the field, too. Advertisers had to tread carefully this year in a divisive political climate. Some went for all out escapist humor like T-Mobile and Tide, while others tried to take a more serious tone like the American Petroleum Institute. With 30-second ads costing around $5 million, and more than 110 million people watching, it's a huge gamble to advertise during the game even in a less politically charged atmosphere. Here are the winners whose gamble paid off, and losers who struck the wrong tone. WINNER: TIDE P&G's Tide ad featuring announcer Terry Bradshaw seemed at first to be part of the game broadcast. But when Bradshaw gets a stain on his shirt, he goes on an adventure featuring New England Patriot Rob Gronkowski and actor Jeffrey Tambor to try to find a clean shirt. "It was just from the writing to the casting pure fun," said Mark DiMassimo, CEO of ad agency DiMassimo Goldstein. WINNER: KIA Kia managed to touch on social issues without offending people by tapping Melissa McCarthy to take on causes like saving whales, ice caps and trees, each time to disastrous effect. Kia's 60-second third-quarter ad promotes the fuel efficiency of its 2017 Niro car. WINNER: NFL Two NFL ads aimed to appeal to all. The first ad , "Inside These Lines," narrated by Forest Whitaker, showed scenes of football games and workers prepping a field. The narration stated: "Inside these lines, we may have our differences, but recognize there is more that unites us." Another ad showed Super Bowl babies resembling NFL stars like Chicago Bears coach Mike Ditka and former Seattle Seahawks running back Marshawn Lynch to the tune of Chicago's "You're the Inspiration." WINNER: BUDWEISER Budweiser managed to capture the pre-game buzz with its "Born the Hard Way" spot. The cinematic 60-second spot chronicles co-founder Adolphus Busch's journey from Germany to St. Louis in 1857. He jumps off a burning steamboat and catches a glimpse of Budweiser's iconic Clydesdales mascots before meeting fellow immigrant Eberhard Anheuser. Some people took to Twitter to protest the immigration theme of the ad, but the ad was still one of the most watched ads ahead of the game. WINNER: T-MOBILE The wireless carrier made a big splash during the game by buying up 3 minutes of airtime and stuffing its ads with celebrities. In one ad , Snoop Dogg and Martha Stewart discuss T-Mobile's unlimted data plan with lots of innuendo about Snoop's pot-smoking habit. Kristen Schaal started in two other adparodies of "50 Shades of Grey" that implied having a Verizon plan is like being punished — S&M style. And Justin Bieber and New England Patriots' Rob Gronkowski danced in another ad for the brand. LOSER: AMERICAN PETROLEUM INSTITUTION An ad by a trade group sought to rebrand oil's image, opening with the line that "This ain't your daddy's oil." The ad showed a series of colorful ways oil is allegedly used, including in spray paint and makeup. It said the "oil pumps life," ''oil runs cleaner" and "oil explores space" — unexpected phrases for many that drew some mockery on social media. The American Petroleum Institute says on its website that it represents the oil and natural gas industry, including producers, refiners, suppliers and pipeline operators. Villanova University marketing professor Charles Taylor said its message didn't get across. Get breaking news sent instantly to your inbox Sign Up!

"They're trying to somehow emphasize environmentalism, but I don't think they did it in a way that most consumers would find believable," he said. LOSER: FEBREZE P&G's ad sought to take a humorous approach to saluting the well-known halftime bathroom break. "I love you halftime bathroom break," says actress Kathryn Hahn during the commercial. But not everyone found the "potty humor" appealing. LOSER: SNICKERS Snicker's hyped up its live ad in the third quarter. The ad, set on a Wild West set, started with actor Adam Driver talking about the 21-3 score to prove it was live. But then things seem to go wrong and the set falls apart — on purpose. "You ruin live Super Bowl commercials when you're hungry," the copy reads on screen. "It went by so fast, I almost missed it," said DiMassimo Goldstein CEO Mark DiMassimo. "I think the audience got it (but I'm) not sure it was worth the trouble of doing it live." LOSER: WENDY'S Wendy's sought to emphasize its message of "Always fresh, never frozen" in its ad which showed a meatlocker full of frozen beef and a worker trying to thaw it with a hair dryer to the tune of Foreigner's "Cold as Ice." Ad critic Barbara Lippert says the ad is unappetizing. "All it does is leave you hearing frozen, frozen, frozen," she noted.

Advertisers had to tread carefully this year in a divisive political climate. Some went for all out escapist humor like T-Mobile and Tide, while others tried to take a more serious tone like the American Petroleum Institute. With 30-second ads costing around $5 million, and more than 110 million people watching, it's a huge gamble to advertise during the game even in a less politically charged atmosphere. Here are the winners whose gamble paid off, and losers who struck the wrong tone. WINNER: TIDE P&G's Tide ad featuring announcer Terry Bradshaw seemed at first to be part of the game broadcast. But when Bradshaw gets a stain on his shirt, he goes on an adventure featuring New England Patriot Rob Gronkowski and actor Jeffrey Tambor to try to find a clean shirt. "It was just from the writing to the casting pure fun," said Mark DiMassimo, CEO of ad agency DiMassimo Goldstein. WINNER: KIA Kia managed to touch on social issues without offending people by tapping Melissa McCarthy to take on causes like saving whales, ice caps and trees, each time to disastrous effect. Kia's 60-second third-quarter ad promotes the fuel efficiency of its 2017 Niro car. WINNER: NFL Two NFL ads aimed to appeal to all. The first ad , "Inside These Lines," narrated by Forest Whitaker, showed scenes of football games and workers prepping a field. The narration stated: "Inside these lines, we may have our differences, but recognize there is more that unites us." Another ad showed Super Bowl babies resembling NFL stars like Chicago Bears coach Mike Ditka and former Seattle Seahawks running back Marshawn Lynch to the tune of Chicago's "You're the Inspiration." WINNER: BUDWEISER Budweiser managed to capture the pre-game buzz with its "Born the Hard Way" spot. The cinematic 60-second spot chronicles co-founder Adolphus Busch's journey from Germany to St. Louis in 1857. He jumps off a burning steamboat and catches a glimpse of Budweiser's iconic Clydesdales mascots before meeting fellow immigrant Eberhard Anheuser. Some people took to Twitter to protest the immigration theme of the ad, but the ad was still one of the most watched ads ahead of the game. WINNER: T-MOBILE The wireless carrier made a big splash during the game by buying up 3 minutes of airtime and stuffing its ads with celebrities. In one ad , Snoop Dogg and Martha Stewart discuss T-Mobile's unlimted data plan with lots of innuendo about Snoop's pot-smoking habit. Kristen Schaal started in two other adparodies of "50 Shades of Grey" that implied having a Verizon plan is like being punished — S&M style. And Justin Bieber and New England Patriots' Rob Gronkowski danced in another ad for the brand. LOSER: AMERICAN PETROLEUM INSTITUTION An ad by a trade group sought to rebrand oil's image, opening with the line that "This ain't your daddy's oil." The ad showed a series of colorful ways oil is allegedly used, including in spray paint and makeup. It said the "oil pumps life," ''oil runs cleaner" and "oil explores space" — unexpected phrases for many that drew some mockery on social media. The American Petroleum Institute says on its website that it represents the oil and natural gas industry, including producers, refiners, suppliers and pipeline operators. Villanova University marketing professor Charles Taylor said its message didn't get across. "They're trying to somehow emphasize environmentalism, but I don't think they did it in a way that most consumers would find believable," he said. LOSER: FEBREZE P&G's ad sought to take a humorous approach to saluting the well-known halftime bathroom break. "I love you halftime bathroom break," says actress Kathryn Hahn during the commercial. But not everyone found the "potty humor" appealing. LOSER: SNICKERS Snicker's hyped up its live ad in the third quarter. The ad, set on a Wild West set, started with actor Adam Driver talking about the 21-3 score to prove it was live. But then things seem to go wrong and the set falls apart — on purpose. "You ruin live Super Bowl commercials when you're hungry," the copy reads on screen. "It went by so fast, I almost missed it," said DiMassimo Goldstein CEO Mark DiMassimo. "I think the audience got it (but I'm) not sure it was worth the trouble of doing it live." LOSER: WENDY'S Wendy's sought to emphasize its message of "Always fresh, never frozen" in its ad which showed a meatlocker full of frozen beef and a worker trying to thaw it with a hair dryer to the tune of Foreigner's "Cold as Ice." Ad critic Barbara Lippert says the ad is unappetizing. "All it does is leave you hearing frozen, frozen, frozen," she noted.

Published on February 05, 2017. Reprints Reprints Most Popular In a divisive time for the country on issues such as immigration, much of the ad roster from Super Bowl LI felt too muted for the moment. But a bunch of good ads leaned against walls, physical and otherwise, while some of the others invited everybody to party together for at least one night. Check out all the Super Bowl LI ads here, sortable by rating and brand. And cast your own vote for the best right here. Honda, Yearbooks RPA It's too easy for animation of familiar faces to fall into the uncanny valley of weirdness, like the CGI Carrie Fisher at the end of "Rogue One: A Star Wars Story." But in the hands of RPA and Angus Wall, young versions of Tina Fey, Steve Carrell, Viola Davis, Jimmy Kimmel and others are suddenly your favorite friends from high school, tying a shiny CR-V with an affirming message more effectively than ought to be possible. It's a 10 Hair Care, Four More Years Havas Edge and Hungry Man Productions Damn, It's a 10 Hair Care: You're playing the Trump card to sell hair care products, taking a cheap shot at the president's hair and making it rich with themes of acceptance, and it works. Bai, Gentlemen In-house Finally a celebrity's faux-executive title pays off, here with Justin Timberlake, "chief flavor officer" at Bai Brands and former member of "Bye Bye Bye" boy band 'NSync. Christopher Walken returns to the Super Bowl ad roster after a successful stint with Kia in Super Bowl 50, delivering another winning performance. Bai itself is back after a pretty charming regional spot last year, too. Oh hey, and there's a concise and coherent product pitch. Squarespace, Calling JohnMalkovich.com JohnXHannes While this ad doesn't at all explain why viewers should use Squarespace over some other web platform, it will entertain anyone whose Super Bowl party isn't too loud to hear John Malkovich argue with the domain-name squatter at JohnMalkovich.com. It's part of a broader campaign about the actor's side business in men's fashion, but that's not need-to-know. The craft is enough to shine up the Squarespace brand. Mr. Clean, Cleaner of Your Dreams Leo Burnett Unlike Sunday's work from Procter & Gamble sibling Febreze, this spot shows that you can advertise a cleaning product without dropping viewers in the, uh, mess. It's funny, engaging, affectionate, different and sexy (Georgia-Pacific's less-effective attempts to gin up lust for Brawny Man notwithstanding). That's about the maximum you can ask from an ad in this category. 84 Lumber, The Journey Begins Brunner It's hard to know exactly where building-supplies company 84 Lumber is headed with "The Journey Begins," but you have your suspicions because you know where its protagonists are going: across the border into the U.S. Unfortunately Fox didn't allow 84 Lumber to include the bit with the giant border wall, which would have made things even more clear. And the online finale seals it: "The Will to Succeed Is Always Welcome Here," it concludes. If that part had actually aired, it would have been the strongest statement of the Super Bowl. This ad is still pretty close. Bud Light, Ghost Spuds Wieden & Kennedy Bud Light over the decades has given Super Bowl viewers the highs and lows of big-game advertising, but "Ghost Spuds" is happily near the high end. It's attention-getting, channels the hauntings of "A Christmas Carol" to good effect, and lasts long enough to welcome people who start focusing late ("... Is that … Spuds MacKenzie? And ... he's dead?"). The selling proposition (this beer is for drinking with friends) is as strong as it can be for a pretty nondescript brew. Amazon Alexa, Finger Lick/My Girl/Buster In-house Better than competitors' sweeping odes to your beloved home, where the only thing between you and your loved ones is having to use your hands to turn on the lights or look up a recipe, Amazon's trio of 10-second ads for Alexa in Super Bowl 51 keep it quick and to the point: It's easy to order things with Alexa. Of course it's easy to order things with Amazon, too -- just ask anybody who worked at a store that's out of business now -- but now you can do it for effect. Avocados From Mexico, Secret Society GSD&M Keeping it fresh and light for a third year in a row, Avocados From Mexico sets a scene, lands a few jokes plus a product benefit and almost has time to develop the characters enough for a sitcom pitch. (Not that that worked for ABC's Geico-inspired "Cavemen.") T-Mobile, #Punished and #NSFWireless Publicis Worldwide Kristen Schaal is turned on by the pain of cellphone contracts and getting punished for data overages. The execution is flawless, the product differentiator clear. The best of T-Mobile's three minutes of Super Bowl ads. Snickers, Old West BBDO The Super Bowl's first live ad in a long time surprises with its technical excellence and narrative destination. A sequence of head-fakes and on-key performances -- complete with the score from the game as proof of live -- give viewers something worth leaning forward for. If it isn't as strong an argument for Snickers as the pre-recorded spots with the likes of Betty White and Danny Trejo, the Willem Defoe execution from Super Bowl 50 showed that the theme needed a refresh. Tide, Bradshaw Stain Saatchi & Saatchi Tide and Saatchi & Saatchi kick off this spot with a painstaking recreation of the Fox broadcast booth designed to fool viewers into thinking Terry Bradshaw has really been caught on live TV messing with a shirt stain. It quickly veers into absurd adventures in laundry, with an enjoyably dry turn by Jeffrey Tambor. Points for not only grabbing the audience's attention with something unexpected but making it worthwhile to keep watching. "Restain" makes a nice kicker-slash-reminder later in the game. Mercedes-Benz, Easy Driver Merkley & Partners Aging bikers are found still living the old days in the old ways, just less gracefully than in their youth, and playing the only song in the jukebox: Steppenwolf's "Born to Be Wild." Eventually they confront Peter Fonda, who's ditched the choppers of "Easy Rider" for a Mercedes-AMG GT Roadster and look almost as young as in 1969. The pre-released spot was criticized for allegedly aiming at boomers, but so what: People over 50 buy cars too. Wix, #Disruptive World In-house Jason "The Transporter" Statham and Gal "Wonder Woman" Godot total a restaurant in a brawl against (presumably) bad guys while the chef-preneur in the kitchen happily works on his website using Wix. When he sees the damage, the restaurant (and website) turn food truck. Not just action for the sake of it, the action stars' fight makes a winning pitch. Budweiser, Born the Hard Way Anomaly Bud's "Brewed the Hard Way" tagline/theme/positioning takes a suddenly more credible and powerful turn when it becomes a position on immigration. It's not a polarizing position from the wars of Trump world, but a position all the same: Making a better life by getting to a new country is hard, and worth respect. OK, it's a little political, with a "dream" reference that evokes the young so-called "dreamers" whom Barack Obama tried to protect from deportation. And it's a little silly, mixing hard "Far and Away" scenes with a ready sketch of a Bud bottle between Adolphus Busch and Eberhard Anheuser, but it's bigger than most of the ads in Super Bowl LI, and it's hard to shake politics in February 2017. T-Mobile, #UnlimitedMoves Publicis Worldwide "#UnlimitedMoves" gets points for a snappy narrative, a back-talking dancing kid and Justin Bieber in limited enough quantities (soundtrack included) to not overstay his welcome. Audi, Daughter Venables Bell & Partners In a broadcast that has historically included more than a fair share of commercials you'd call sexist, following a presidential campaign with a surplus of gender controversy, Audi puts down a stake for a position that ought not need be staked: equal pay for women and men. Partly for propelling an idea, partly for presentation that draws you in, this qualifies as a "Super Bowl ad" -- in the way you want. Ford, Go Further Global Team Blue You might question a company that sells cars and trucks when it tries to position itself as a "mobility" company, as if a Bay Area bike-share sponsorship and recently-acquired shuttle service change the marketer's core product. But you can't question this ad's touch with vignettes that are relatable instead of boring, soundtrack choice (Nina Simon's "I Wish I Knew How It Would Feel to Be Free") and affirmation that sitting behind the wheel in traffic isn't the only life there is. In terms of corporate branding, Ford just gave itself a big push. Kia, Hero's Journey David & Goliath At first this ad might make a non-practicing environmental warrior feel guilty about his inaction or angry at Kia for having some fun with it, but in the end if you're not going to do much about global warming, you might as well buy a car with good mileage. It's not aspirational advertising -- it's more like a case for giving up on New Year's resolutions -- but it's probably more effective than New Year's resolutions anyway. Michelob Ultra, Our Bar FCB This is the best of Michelob Ultra's Super Bowl advertising yet, easily outshining last year's competent but essentially silent lonely-workout video. Solitary sweating has been replaced by group exertions set to the heartwarming theme song from "Cheers," of all things. (I'd love to see Cliff and Norm keep up with this pack of morning-rave tough mudders.) If Bud Light is now about friends, Michelob Ultra isn't going to be left out of the party. Sprite, Tacos Wieden & Kennedy A crisp play on endorsements and authenticity -- Sprite endorser LeBron James refuses to tell viewers to drink Sprite, even while his friends urge him to earn his pay and the line flashes on the screen anyway -- is good fun for Super Bowl Sunday. Too bad it's not new for the game. Airbnb, We Accept In-house The sentiment is strong and timely and right, though the execution -- unfortunately given only a few days to come together after a last-minute buy by Airbnb -- is like a Benetton ad without the passion, like Michael Jackson's "Black or White" video without the music. GoDaddy, Good Morning Bullish It's (almost) always fun to roll up a bunch of internet references in one place and trigger pleasurable-recognition nerves to fire en masse, and you can't go wrong with Rick Astley playing you out. But otherwise the spot is more of an appreciation of memes than anything to do with GoDaddy, leaving some potential on the floor. The web services company has come a long way from its "SAY MY NAME!" sexed-up stunt ads of a decade ago, but sometimes the next level of marketing is the harder one. Lexus, Man & Machine Team One Lil' Buck dances energetically around the new Lexus LC 500 performance coupe to "Move Your Body" by Sia, with a cameo by the Lexus LS. Charismatic dancer and charismatic car somehow fail to unify into a coherent message. Coca-Cola, Love Story Fitzco/McCann This ad would get more stars any other day of the year, but this is a Super Bowl ad review, and this ad has been on the air for a while. That said, it's a convincing, attractive spot. TurboTax, Humpty Hospital Wieden & Kennedy Seeing Humpty Dumpty's nursery-rhyme ill fortune take realistic form, from the depressing hospital room to the seeping bodily fluids to the guilt and recriminations, is compelling enough. And there's a clear link to TurboTax to boot, as Humpty uses live video chat to find out whether he can write off the costs associated with treating his severe injuries. Still a little down for Super Bowl Sunday's party atmosphere. NFL, Inside These Lines Translation The NFL positions itself as an apolitical common ground for the country. It may not be 100% accurate, especially after a season when some people tried to blame bad ratings on Colin Kaepernick's refusal to stand during the national anthem. But it's true enough, and a welcome offer. Alfa Romeo, Mozzafiato Doner Alfa Romeo's trio of ads in Super Bowl LI improved as the night went on, making this fourth-quarter conclusion Fiat Chrysler's best investment of the night. It would have been nice if the brand had nailed a broader framework than the awesomeness of the machine, but it didn't, so this sexy sheet-metal approach is the one to take. Skittles, Romance Adam & Eve/DDB This jewel-box of pleasantly dumb candy humor works for Super Bowl Sunday: A teenager lobs Skittles through the window of his love interest, unaware that she's letting her mom, dad, grandma, home intruder, cop, etc. each take a turn catching candy in their mouths. Hey, people (and a beaver) actually enjoying the product -- that's a nice twist. Busch, Buschhhhh Deutsch Like Wendy's one-note ode to never-frozen beef, Busch nails the execution of the lone joke here, an update on the brand's old TV ads making opening a can of beer into a sound of nature. But the impression it leaves is about as deep as a mountain stream. Google, Home by You. Help by Google. 72andSunny A nice montage of coming-home, partying-at-home, cooking-at-home and other at-home activities can't close the deal on Google Home, the search giant's voice-controlled device. It can pull up information, dim the lights and turn up the music, but it's not usually that hard to do any of those things without a Google Home. In terms of Super Bowl advertising, this is also one of a few that's not new for the game, which takes away from the fun; on YouTube, it has more than 1 million views. Lifewtr, Inspiration Drops Hustle Pepsico's new bottled water brand captures your eye with raindrops that fill a city with color as a John Legend soundtrack plays. It also alarms you a little as a little girl looks skyward to catch some of the very-not-normal rain in her mouth. Because it's hard for any marketer to differentiate its wate to say much about the brand attributes of water, thought, that's fine: It's more enjoyable and less preachy than the Fiji Water ad that also ran Sunday. Buick, Not So Pee Wee Football EngageM-1 Buick's shaky Super Bowl 50 ad also pursued the "That's a Buick?" theme that sometimes seems to internalize bad perceptions of the brand at least as much it counters them. Where the prior big-game ad gave viewers a pretty dull wedding and a car so nice nobody believed it was a Buick, though, "No So Pee Wee Football" shows confidence that transfers to the product. It's just still an ad you'd see any day, not a big-stage force. Wendy's, Cold Storage VML Killer song choice (Foreigner's classic-rock "Cold as Ice") and message discipline (one pitch, no twist) help Wendy's first Super Bowl ad stand out from the pack. The question is whether fast-food customers care enough about fresh meat for this to give Wendy's a boost. They're also undoubtedly familiar with the premise, which Wendy's has been pushing for years. And, not to sound like the auto dealers that always corporate to show more cars on winding roads in their branding spots, but it wouldn't hurt to show a Wendy's sandwich. Turkish Airlines, Manifest M&C Saatchi/Istanbul Airline advertising isn't the easiest category in which to stand out, unless you're promoting seats that fold down into private pods and food better than you get on the ground -- i.e., airlines too expensive for you to every enjoy. So Morgan Freeman and Turkish Airlines do much of seems possible, selling the value of travel in a quality life. But if that value is partly about "finding delight in our differences," why does the camera then pan to a plane full of Morgan Freeman clones? NFL, Super Bowl Babies Legends Grey The curse of the Super Bowl sequel, in which brands struggle to live up to the prior year's beloved big-game ad, has afflicted marketers including Volkswagen (trying to follow "The Force"), EDS (looking to match "Cat Herders"), McDonald's ("The Showdown") and Apple ("1984"). Now it's the NFL's turn to try, 12 months after a great spot featuring choirs of kids supposedly conceived after various Super Bowl victories. The result is a thin costume party for babies whose soft skulls remind you of the risks of playing football. Intel, Brady Everyday McGarryBowen Props to Intel and McGarryBowen for hiring the quarterback arguably most likely to actually play in Super Bowl LI, as opposed to, say, Cam Newton in Buick's ad. But like many of the two-star ads from Sunday's game, it's got about one thing to say, and doesn't try to say it in more than one way. Persil ProClean, 10 Dimensions TBWA Wait, Bill Nye the Science Guy thinks "looks clean, smells clean, feels clean" is "10 dimensions of clean," not three? Somehow these calculations are not adding up. Persil has expanded on a 15-second debut in Super Bowl 50 with this 30-second ad, but the concentrated pitch a year earlier -- an unknown brand topped all its big rivals on a performance test -- was more convincing. WeatherTech, Tech Team Pinnacle Advertising WeatherTech's "Made in America" pitch has comprised virtually all of its messaging for three Super Bowls in a row, so it's a little surprising to see the focus shift away just as the same theme helped elect a new president of the United States. Then again, the new president is polarizing, to put it mildly, so the brand may have made the smart play here by adding a narrative beyond going to work at the WeatherTech factory. But the action sequence can't compete with Wix.com's Statham-and-Godot ass-kickery. Alfa Romeo, Dear Predictable The Richards Group Better than the second-quarter "Riding Dragons" but weaker than the fourth-quarter "Mozzafiato," the third-quarter "Dear Predictable" doesn't quite make sense. The narrator's "Dear John" letter to boredom isn't that interesting itself. And it's signed "Giulia," the name of the car being promoted, as if it had somehow been a less-fun car until now, or was dating a dull driver, or ... something. No time to figure it out before the ad is gone. Luckily the car looks great. Febreze, America's Halftime Bathroom Break Grey Possibly effective, and well-tailored to the Super Bowl, but ultimately a little unpleasant for the communal viewing going on around the country on Super Bowl Sunday. Nintendo, Always Exploring Leo Burnett You can't call it big-game advertising per se, but it will engage anybody who cares about console gaming and/or a step above mobile gaming. It helps to have a product that's new and different, a prime use case for a $5 million Super Bowl buy. KFC, Colonel vs. Colonel Wieden & Kennedy The advantage of a strong campaign, full of rotating Colonel Sanders portrayals and jabs of sunny humor, is also a bit of a disadvantage for KFC on Super Bowl Sunday, when people want to see something they haven't before. Even if the ad is new (new-ish: it was released the Tuesday before the game), it continues a campaign that grabbed you more when the whole idea was new. Georgia Gold Colonel Billy Zane made his TV debut late last month and Kentucky Buckets Colonel Rob Riggle has been on the air this whole NFL season. So it works but it also squanders the chance to let viewers consider commercials special again, returning them to the mindset of the other 364 days a year, when an ad is just an ad. At least at 15 seconds it's pretty snappy. King's Hawaiian, False Cabinet Levit Agency It's hard to avoid comparing "False Cabinet" with Bud Light's 2006 Super Bowl ad "Secret Fridge," both of which involve hiding stuff behind a wall where little moochers get the last laugh. It's too bad they weren't a series, actually, moving from kids who love bread and miracles to dudes who love beer and miracles. And it's tempting to hold it against King's Hawaiian that the ad was already airing before Super Bowl Sunday, which deserves new creative. But like "Secret Fridge," "False Cabinet" is entertaining on the first couple viewings, and of course many Super Bowl viewers have never seen it before. Alfa Romeo, Riding Dragons Art Machine The further the night's Alfa Romeo spots stray from focusing on the car, the worse they are. The first of three to air, "Riding Dragons" is done in by the hackneyed introspection of the voiceover -- do not get stuck talking to this guy at a party. It isn't helped by the cliched piano soundtrack and gender stereotypes about power (boys/men) and grace (girls/women). The new Alfa Romeo Giulia punches through whenever it's on-screen, but every second that it's out of sight is lost time. Wonderful Pistachios, Treadmill The Wonderful Agency Wonderful Pistachios has already turned out sharp creative starring Ernie the Elephant, voiced by the WWE's John Cena, like the 15-second commercial about Ernie getting "randomly" strip-searched at airport security. And Apple already made the falling-off-a-treadmill ad of the year with Taylor Swift in "Taylor vs. Treadmill." Wonderful Pistachios can (and will) do better than this. T-Mobile, #BagOfUnlimited Publicis Worldwide If you can't get enough of Snoop Dogg pot jokes or his odd-couple pairing with Martha Stewart (they have a VH1 series called "Martha & Snoop's Pot Luck Dinner Party"), this is the Super Bowl ad for you. Otherwise it's hard to get much out of this one. H&R Block, Future Fallon In trying to excite taxpayers about the application of IBM's Watson AI technology to H&R Block tax prep services, which really is a good marketing proposition, the ad winds up resembling the video you watch at the museum before you're admitted to the planetarium. The tone is wondrous, the substance is light. Michelin, I Need You TBWA/Chiat/Day A globe-spanning commercial shot in France, China and South Africa shows people uniting via cars on Michelin tires, with flashes of the cartoon Michelin Man. Its innocuous good feelings accrue to the Michelin brand halo, but almost imperceptibly in one showing. Expect heavy frequency in the campaign's TV schedule to build a cumulative effect. American Petroleum Institute, Power Past Impossible GSD&M "This ain't your daddy's oil" -- really? This isn't my dad's ad for oil, with some modern-ish deisgn and color, so it's good in that respect. It still focuses too much on what oil's good for, which as we already know is just about everything except the future of the planet, and only very passingly on the assertion that "Oil runs cleaner." "Evony: The King's Return," The Battle of Evony Butler, Shine, Stern & Partners Top Games spent almost enough money to promote a reintroduction of its Evony multiplayer game, and hired nearly big-enough stars in Aaron Eckhart as George Washington, Jeffrey Dean Morgan as King Arthur and Fan Bingbing as Empress Wu Zetian. But the promise of spectacular action is never fulfilled, unlike the "Mobile Strike" ad starring Arnold Schwarzenegger. It's reminiscent of a major battle long in the making early in HBO's "Game of Thrones" -- and then conducted off-screen. "Mobile Strike," Arnold's One-Liners 215McCann Speaking of the action in mobile-game Super Bowl 51 ads: Arnold Schwarzenegger and the rest of this just-fine "Mobile Strike" spot hit their marks perfectly -- he his prior one-liners, the game its enemy targets. If only this was one of those Schwarzenegger classics, or even last year's "Mobile Strike" Super Bowl ad, instead of execution over ideas. "World of Tanks," Teensy House Buyers and Real Awful Moms Mekanism Back-to-back 15-second spots execute the same gag -- spoofs of reality-TV shows are suddenly disrupted by the arrival of a tank -- but one might have been better. It's pretty funny to break the "tension" of teesy home-buying decisions, but the "Awful Moms" bit channels the negative vibe of "Real Housewives" shows a little too effectively. Fiji Water, Nature's Gift The Wonderful Agency Kid narrators aren't persuasive when they talk like they're slowly giving an adult lecture. It doesn't happen in real life, outside plays maybe, and there's not even an analogue. "Fiji Water is a gift from nature to us," a very young person says breathily, as a bottle of it onscreen represents the good cop of "Koyaanisqatsi" to the surrounding cityscapes' bad cop. Maybe the Fiji Water Foundation's good work is a reason to pick this bottled water over another, if your tap isn't good enough, but this ad doesn't make that case.

Rothenberg discussed this topic during a keynote session the IAB's 2017 Annual Leadership Meeting. And he suggested that the rise of "fake news" can be linked back to deeper problems at the heart of the digital industry. The first such issue involves the absence of shared measurement standards. "This every-man-woman-and-company-for-itself nonsense that increasingly has dominated our digital media business relationships is [tragic]," Rothenberg said. (For more details, read Warc's exclusive report: IAB chief chastises, challenges digital leadership.) Such an argument builds on the views of Marc Pritchard, Chief Brand Officer at Procter & Gamble, who outlined a pressing need to clean up the digital supply chain during the same event. Elaborating further on this theme, Rothenberg asserted that the absence of shared measurement standards effectively places a "creativity tax" and an "ROI tax" on marketers. "It sucks up staff time and our customers' money into endless disputes over existential theories, methodologies, and even observable facts," Rothenberg said. "Worse, non-compliance with industry standards has put us on the slippery slope to relativism that leads directly to fake news, industry mistrust, and social degradation." Rothenberg also recommended that marketers conduct a thorough audit of the organisations they work with, to ensure they are not connected with propagating the spread of misinformation. "This is not difficult. Simply ask your finance department to create a list of all your customer payables. Then commission a team to review the list to determine who your customers actually are, and what they do for a living," he said. "If they're engaged in … anything else you wouldn't want your parents, spouses, neighbours, or children to know about, then stop doing business with them. "And once you've reviewed and cleared your customers, do the same thing with your suppliers." While this may seem like a small step, Rothenberg stated that the deep interconnectivity characterising the digital universe means the collective weight of such actions can make a tangible difference. "This is not a vain exercise," Rothenberg insisted. "What we say here, what we do here, makes a difference ... We face a challenge that has boiled over into crisis – perhaps the greatest crisis it is possible to face. "It is a crisis not of our industry, not of our digital media and marketing village, but a crisis of society writ large."

Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 7 February 2017 by Military News Gillette® Enters eSports Through Global Partnership with ESL as Sponsor of the Intel® Extreme Masters World Championship Katowice 2017 BOSTON–(BUSINESS WIRE)–For more than 100 years Gillette® [NYSE: PG], the world’s leading male grooming brand, has aligned itself with some of the most prominent and respected athletes and sports leagues in the world. Today, the brand is proud to announce a new partnership with ESL, the world’s largest eSports company, through a sponsorship of the Intel® Extreme Masters (IEM) World Championship in Katowice, Poland from February 24-26, 2017. Leading Gillette’s entrance into gaming is the brand’s first ever eSports athlete, Enrique “xPeke” Cedeño. xPeke is uniquely qualified to join Gillette’s line-up of all-star athletes from his success as a professional gamer, team owner, and former IEM Katowice Most Valuable Player (MVP). Gillette experience during the Intel® Extreme Masters World Championship Katowice 2017 “It’s been exciting and eye-opening as we’ve immersed ourselves in the gaming community and discovered that both professional and amateur gamers have a lot in common with other premier athletes and sports fanatics. Gamers at all levels recognize the importance of precision – split seconds and minute movements make big differences. We get that obsession with precision better than anyone,” said John Mang, Vice President, Global Gillette. „Gillette is thrilled to partner with ESL to join this evolving and growing community.” Demonstrating a shared passion for cutting edge technology, Gillette will offer the teams and fans at IEM Katowice the opportunity to customize Gillette razor handles using 3D printing technology at its RZR MKR Design Studio. Additionally, the brand will provide grooming services to all League of Legend’s competitors throughout the opening weekend and will host autograph sessions and other activities with xPeke. “Gillette has been a leader in sports for many years, often partnering with the top leagues and players, and we are thrilled to welcome such an iconic global brand to our ESL family, ” said Craig Levine, CEO of ESL North America. “Gillette understands the growing popularity of eSports and will play an integral role in helping us enhance the fan experience at the IEM Katowice World Championship.” In addition to the RZR MKR Design Studio experience, Gillette will give fans an exclusive inside look at one of the best and most relentless eSports players in the world, xPeke. The “Pursuit of Precision” content series will bring fans closer to the legendary xPeke as he visits the Gillette World Shaving Headquarters in Boston and discusses the precision required to be a top eSports player and the added pressures of owning a League of Legends team during the current eSports boom. “As a former IEM Katowice MVP and current team owner, I understand the relentless pursuit of precision required to be the best player I can possibly be,” said xPeke. “Gillette obsesses over razor blades the same way I obsess over League of Legends strategy and it’s that common dedication that made me realize how much Gillette actually has in common with gamers,” explained xPeke. “I’m happy and humbled to be their first global eSports ambassador and get the chance to show more of the world how much precision eSports requires.” For additional information, please visit Gillette’s YouTube channel to view the “Pursuit of Precision” content series which will posted on February 6th.

This year, however, Time named the Always "Like A Girl" campaign one of the top 20 Super Bowl ads of all time. Also this year, the NFL Women's Summit (with partners including Always, Secret, and Amy Poehler's Smart Girls, and speakers including, well, half the U.S. women's Olympic gymnastics team) took Super Bowl week by storm, involving hundreds of teen girls in panels and activities to build their confidence in sports, business, and beyond. In the past two years, the Super Bowl has seemingly gone from a boy's club whose advertising space couldn't bear the sight of a single tampon to the hub of a national girl-power summit. What gives? We spoke with the NFL's Dawn Hudson and Always' Jen Davis to find out. At first glance, it does seem like an odd pairing: a major national event for young women, sponsored by...the NFL? But the numbers don't lie: Women make up nearly half of football fans, and historically, they have not received the same quality of targeted marketing attention that the other half has. So, "this summit was really the women in the NFL wanting to reach out and do something for women," explains Hudson, the NFL's chief marketing officer. "A passion point to make a difference — to put our girl power to work in a positive way and leverage the visibility of the super bowl. Make no mistake: Avid female football fans are just as avid as male football fans." Hudson adds that airing the Always "Like A Girl" ad during the 2015 Super Bowl was "a pretty bold move... People thought, Jeez, a whole stadium? We’re going to put a feminine care ad on the big screen? And when they did, the whole stadium erupted into applause." But the commercial's success wasn't only due to the sheer numbers of women who watch the Super Bowl and hope to see themselves reflected — somewhere, anywhere — in its advertising; the ad's content also highlighted a major issue in teen girls' lives. "Always' mission is to stop the drop in confidence that occurs in puberty for over half of girls," explains Davis, who works with Always as vice president and general manager of North America feminine care at Proctor & Gamble. "Many of those girls never recover from that loss of confidence... Prior to that ad, only 19% of girls associated 'like a girl' with being a positive phrase; it’s now 76%." The NFL Women's Summit is doing its part to continue that confidence-building legacy. Of this year's 400 attendees, 250 were teen girls. And although last year's inaugural summit was largely focused on inspiring girls to stay in sports, this year's summit had even wider aspirations — thanks to its location in the Super Bowl's host town. "We’re in Houston," Hudson explains, "a town that’s full of astronauts, biotechnicians, and engineers. These are areas that women statistically don’t go into so much — much like sports. So we wanted to inspire girls to open their eyes to what’s possible for them. I feel like we achieved that during the summit — but the girls themselves will be the deciders." When asked whether young women will need to fight harder than ever for our rights and our futures (given the current abysmal state of affairs in Washington), Hudson is fiercely optimistic, insisting that "women are too successful and have too much going for them" to sit idly by and let our rights be taken away. "Women want to help women," she adds. "If we put our minds to it, we CAN change the world." On that point, we wholeheartedly agree.

In this year's Super Bowl advertising some of the most well-known and iconic brands were represented, but a trailer for a surprise hit that taps into 80's nostalgia stole the show. Danny Vena (TMFLifeIsGood) Feb 7, 2017 at 8:05AM During last night's Super Bowl, Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) released a 30-second teaser trailer for the highly anticipated second season of its surprise summer hit Stranger Things. With an estimated average cost of $5 million dollars for a 30-second commercial, this was a big gamble for Netflix. Advertisers tend to bring their A game, but not everyone gets their money's worth. Consumer reactions can be hard to anticipate. Stranger Things season 2 trailer created the most buzz among Super Bowl ads. Image source: Netflix, Inc. And the winner is... It looks like Netflix strategy paid off. Based on data obtained from marketing technology company Amobee, Business Insider is reporting that the Stranger Things season 2 trailer created the most buzz of any Super Bowl commercial. The ad generated 307,000 tweets between 6:30 p.m. and 11:00 p.m. eastern time, which corresponds with the time the game aired. That was three times more tweets than the next company, and the total was more than the next three combined. Its success is being corroborated by Media Life Magazine, which is reporting that the trailer created 479.9 million social impressions, the most for of any ad.  Place T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS), took the second spot, with 91,700 tweets. This was a much more expensive proposition for the company, as it bought more than three full minutes of ad time.Its advertisements featured a variety of celebrities including Justin Bieber, rapper Snoop Dogg with home-making maven Martha Stewart, and comedienne Kristen Schaal, all promoting its unlimited data plan. As the number three carrier, T-Mobile is keen to gain ground against competitors Verizon and AT&T. And show  The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) made a surprise appearance in third place with 80,800 tweets for its Mr. Clean ad, which depicts the "sexy" version of its animated character dancing while cleaning a woman's house. As the woman's fantasy clears, it is revealed to be her husband. Companies spend big on Super Bowl ads as it is one of the most iconic sporting events in the country and offers the unique ability to influence a large portion of the population in one sitting. This year's game is estimated to have been viewed by nearly 114 million people, a number equivalent to 35% of the US population. The day after the game, people aren't only talking about the big plays and the score, but the ads as well. Netflix great content is enjoyed worldwide! Image source: Netflix. Great content crosses borders Netflix streaming service seeks to stave off competition from recent market entrants like Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), which also recently rolled out its service to over 200 countries. Stranger Things success as the most talked about Super Bowl ad can generate additional interest in the show and increase subscribers for the service. Stranger Things was already the surprise hit of the summer for the streaming giant and won at last week's Screen Actors Guild awards, taking the statue for best ensemble in a drama series. Netflix has previously reported that "high quality content travels well across borders."  Final thoughts A win in Super Bowl advertising can create buzz, which can result in additional subscribers, and increased mind share. Studies have concluded that successful Super Bowl ads can provide temporary stock price increases, larger movie box office takes, and heightened awareness of a company's brand. Netflix is hoping to parley an already successful series into a worldwide smash hit. It appears to have completed the all-important first step in that process.

See Offers Business Posted February 6 Updated February 6 increase font size Gender-themed ads like Audi’s criticized, but not going away The post-election mood has made the messages more dangerous for promoting a company's brand. By Jena McgregorThe Washington Post Share Comment Read Article One of the most-discussed ads Sunday night during the Super Bowl was not about football, beer or food. It was an Audi ad about the gender pay gap, featuring a dad watching his little girl competing in a cart race and questioning whether she’d be compensated equally as an adult. “What do I tell my daughter?” the narrator asks. The spot was praised and pilloried. “Lean In” author Sheryl Sandberg, posting about it on Facebook, said “now more than ever, we need ads like this which push back on gender stereotypes,” while high-profile Twitter users and consumers hailed the ad for its message. Audi's Super Bowl ad highlighting the gender pay gap was both praised and pilloried. Courtesy of the Audi USA YouTube channel Search photos available for purchase: Photo Store → But it also received heaping criticism, with more dislikes than likes on YouTube and, as of late last week, more negative than positive comments, according to a research firm cited by The Wall Street Journal. Many of the comments questioned the basis of a gender pay gap. “This whole commercial is based off a lie,” one wrote on YouTube. “Women don’t make less than men. Total propaganda.” (The gender wage gap is a complex topic, which can be primarily explained by differences in industry and occupation choice, hours worked, and gaps for taking time off to have children. But researchers have also repeatedly found that part of the gap that remains is “unexplained” or unaccounted for by any of these factors.) The brouhaha over Audi’s “Daughter” spot provided a data point to those wondering how the “femvertising” trend of recent years – the move by brands like Dove, Always and Pantene to embrace gender empowerment themes in their ads – might fare in the aftermath of such a divisive presidential campaign and amid heightened politicization of seemingly any corporate speech. Brands, after all, now find themselves navigating two different movements: Consumers are threatening boycotts and backlash any time a brand wades into seemingly political turf, while voices from the right appear emboldened after the election, criticizing topics that invited much less public controversy in the past. Yet at the same time, the worldwide Women’s March provided a massive counterpoint, demonstrating a powerful force and dynamic response that have elevated women’s issues in the national conversation. Former Wall Street executive Sallie Krawcheck pointed to both in a recent interview. On the one hand, she’s found online comments to her writing on gender issues transformed from professional and polite before the election to angry and contradictory after it was over. Yet in surveys of professional women, she’s also seen them say again and again that they want to take action. “There seems to be sort of an awakening, not just from the election, that we didn’t make as much progress as we thought we did,” she told The Washington Post in January. “There’s a different energy among professional women right now.” Samantha Skey, president and chief revenue officer of SheKnows Media, a digital media company that runs an awards program for such women-focused campaigns, thinks such ads will continue for brands where it makes sense. “It’s just going to invite more discussion because it’s going to seem political,” she says. Internal efforts to improve gender diversity at agencies, combined with the long-term trend of brands being armed with more and more data to reach their target customers, could also play a role in their expansion. “There is no middle right now,” Skey says. Susie Nam, chief operating officer at Droga5, the agency behind Under Armour’s “I Will What I Want” women’s campaign, agrees the trend will continue. “I think there will be more of it,” she says. The brands that succeed will be those that tap into “a really deep-rooted emotional core” and “deep insights about how we’re socialized to behave in a certain way,” rather than simply latching onto the latest marketing trend. She cites the “Like a Girl” campaign for Procter & Gamble’s Always feminine products as one example that embraced the concept credibly. “If you can get to that level of insight, where there’s no dispute, it becomes interesting,” Nam said. While ads explicitly focused on gender issues will continue, they could also become more subtle, where a female CEO is featured, say, but equality is not the core theme. Meanwhile, young “Generation Z” consumers remain concerned about discrimination issues of other groups, too. “I think the Women’s March is an opening in a lot of ways, not only for ‘femvertising’ but an embrace of non-marginalization,” Skey said. Both Nam and Skey note that structural changes in advertising agencies could also be a catalyst. Skey points to General Mills, which began pressuring the agencies it works with to have more gender-balanced teams last year. And Nam said that internal work at agencies like her own to confront unconscious biases, particularly in a male-dominated industry, is likely to create more awareness of those issues in the work they produce. Asking questions like ” ‘why did I think, when we need gravitas in that CEO, that it needed to be a man?’ start to permeate the work that gets out into the world. It’s an inside-out effort,” she says. A spokeswoman for Audi of America could not confirm whether the automaker has a policy like General Mills’ in place, but pointed to other gender initiatives at the company. It signed the Obama White House’s Equal Pay Pledge, has instituted a graduate internship program where 50 percent of enrollment must be female, and has made other external efforts to grow female leaders in fields such as science and the arts. Skey thinks Audi’s message will likely resonate with its upscale target customer. “If you see a middle-of-the-road brand approaching this strategy, it is more risky,” she says. “I don’t doubt that Audi did this with eyes wide open about who it was going to alienate and who it was going to ingratiate.” Share Read or Post Comments Were you interviewed for this story?

Church & Dwight Reports Results Q4 Reported EPS of $0.42; Adjusted EPS of $0.44 Exceeds Outlook 2017 EPS Outlook: Reported $1.72 to $1.74; Adjusted $1.89, up 7% February 07, 2017 07:00 AM Eastern Standard Time EWING, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Church & Dwight Co., Inc. (NYSE:CHD):   2016 Fourth Quarter Results 2016 Full Year Results Reported sales growth +2.6%; Organic +2.7% Reported sales growth +2.9%; Organic +3.2% Reported Gross Margin flat; Adjusted +60 bps Reported Gross Margin +100 bps; Adjusted +120 bps Reported Operating Margin flat; Adjusted +50 bps Reported EPS growth 13.6%; Adjusted 9.3% Reported EPS growth of 2.4%; Adjusted 7.3% Cash from operations $655MM; +8.1%   Church & Dwight Co., Inc. (NYSE:CHD) today announced that full year 2016 reported EPS increased 13.6% to $1.75 per share. Adjusted EPS increased 9.3% from $1.62 to $1.77 per share, exceeding the Company’s outlook. Adjusted EPS excludes a charge ($0.02 per share) related to the pending sale of the Brazilian Specialty Products business. Full year 2016 reported sales grew 2.9% to $3,493 million. Organic sales grew 3.2% driven by the global Consumer Products business which grew by 4.2%. Matthew Farrell, Chief Executive Officer, commented, “We again delivered top tier performance within the consumer packaged goods industry including full year organic sales growth of 3.2%, double digit international organic sales growth, adjusted gross margin expansion of 120 basis points and adjusted earnings growth of 9.3%. We overcame the year-long cyclical weakness in our Specialty Products business to deliver on our commitment to shareholders. Finally, we concluded the year with a strong fourth quarter.” Fourth Quarter Review Reported net sales increased $22.4 million or 2.6% to $896.0. Organic sales growth of 2.7% exceeded the Company’s outlook of 1 to 2% driven by the global Consumer Products business. Global Consumer reported sales grew 3.2% (3.5% organic) driven by 4.1% volume growth. Specialty Products reported sales declined 4.3% (-5.2% organic). Total organic sales growth was driven by volume growth of 3.2% partially offset by 0.5% from unfavorable product mix and pricing. Reported EPS increased $0.01 to $0.42 a share. When adjusted to exclude the Brazilian charge, EPS increased $0.03 to $0.44 or 7% per share, exceeding the Company’s outlook. Consumer Domestic reported net sales were $695.4 million, a $23.1 million or 3.4% increase. Organic sales increased by 2.7% primarily due to A&H liquid and unit dose laundry detergent, A&H cat litter, BATISTE dry shampoo, VITAFUSION and L’IL CRITTERS gummy vitamins and OXICLEAN additives, partially offset by a decline in sales of A&H powder laundry detergent and SPINBRUSH toothbrushes. Volume growth contributed 3.5% to organic sales partially offset by a decrease of 0.8% attributable to product mix and pricing. ARM & HAMMER unit dose laundry detergent grew at twice the category consumption growth for the third consecutive quarter while also increasing share. Sales in unmeasured channels continue to grow, especially online retailers which recorded its highest quarterly growth of 2016. In particular, online vitamin and litter sales more than doubled versus last year. Growth in non-measured channels accounted for approximately 300 basis points of organic growth. Consumer International reported net sales were $127.6 million, a $2.6 million or 2.1% increase. Organic sales increased by 7.4%, driven largely by BATISTE, OXICLEAN AND A&H baking soda in the export business and STERIMAR, A&H liquid laundry detergent and baking soda in Mexico. Volume increased 7.2%, while favorable product mix and pricing contributed 0.2%. Specialty Products reported net sales were $73.0 million, a $3.3 million or 4.3% decrease. Organic sales decreased 5.2% due to lower volumes in the specialty chemical sector of the business. The animal nutrition business was down slightly, but saw improved demand from the USA dairy industry as milk prices and dairy farm profitability improved. Gross margin was flat at 45.5% on a reported basis. On an adjusted basis, excluding the Brazilian charge, gross margin increased 60 basis points. The increase was due to productivity programs and the impact of a higher margin acquired business, offset by higher raw material costs. Marketing expense was $116.3 million, a decrease of $3.8 million or 3.2%. Marketing expense as a percentage of net sales decreased 70 basis points to 13.0% in-line with the Company’s outlook. Selling, general, and administrative expense (SG&A) was $118.3 million or 13.2% of net sales, an 80 basis point increase primarily due to higher costs associated with acquisitions, incentive compensation and higher R&D spending. Income from Operations on a reported basis was $173.4 million or 19.3% of net sales, a 10 basis point decrease. On an adjusted basis, excluding the Brazilian charge, operating margin increased 50 basis points to 19.9% of net sales. The reported effective tax rate was 34.9%, compared to 33.8% last year. On an adjusted basis, excluding the Brazilian charge, the effective rate was 33.9%. Operating Cash Flow For the full year 2016, net cash from operating activities was $655.3 million, a $49.2 million increase from the prior year due to a decrease in working capital and higher cash earnings. Capital expenditures for the full year 2016 were $49.8 million, a $12.0 million decrease from the prior year when the Company was completing the York vitamin plant expansion. At December 31, 2016, cash on hand was $187.8 million, while total debt was $1,120.1 million. The Company continues to have significant financial flexibility for acquisitions. 7% Dividend Increase The Company’s Board of Directors today declared a 7% increase in the regular quarterly dividend from $0.1775 to $0.19 per share, equivalent to an annual dividend of $0.76 per share. This raises the dividend payout from $183 million to approximately $195 million to maintain a 40% targeted payout ratio. The quarterly dividend will be payable March 1, 2017 to stockholders of record at the close of business on February 21, 2017. This is the 21st consecutive year in which the Company has increased the dividend. The Company has paid a regular consecutive quarterly dividend for 116 years. Mr. Farrell commented, “This action reflects the Company’s desire for stockholders to benefit from our continued strong growth and is an indication of our confidence in the Company’s performance. The Company expects to generate over $1.8 billion in free cash flow over the next three years. Our robust cash flow enables us to deliver higher value directly to our stockholders while maintaining significant financial flexibility.” Acquisitions On December 22, 2016, the Company acquired the ANUSOL and RECTINOL brands from Johnson & Johnson, Inc. for $130 million. These are the #1 or #2 hemorrhoid care brands mainly sold in the U.K., Canada, Australia and South Africa with 2016 annual sales of $24 million. The acquisition adds scale to our growing international division. On January 17, 2017, the Company acquired the VIVISCAL business from Lifes2Good Holdings Limited for $160 million. Viviscal is the #1 non-drug hair care supplement brand mainly sold in the U.S. and the U.K. with annual 2016 sales of $44 million. This brand is complementary to the Company’s global BATISTE dry shampoo and TOPPIK hair care business. Both acquisitions were financed with debt and are expected to be slightly dilutive to EPS ($0.01 per share) in 2017 due to transition costs. In 2018, we expect the two acquisitions to be accretive to EPS. Both acquisitions add high gross margin, asset-light brands to the Company’s portfolio. The Company intends to continue to aggressively pursue acquisitions. 2017 New Products Mr. Farrell commented, “Innovation continues to be a big driver of our success. In support of our long term strategy to drive revenue and earnings growth, we are pleased to announce 2017 new product launches in several categories. We are launching ARM & HAMMER CLUMP & SEAL SLIDE cat litter, a revolutionary new litter that doesn’t stick to the litter box and ARM & HAMMER unit dose 3-in-1 POWER PAKS laundry detergent. We are introducing a new VITAFUSION energy variant that supports everyday energy needs and alertness. TROJAN is launching a new XOXO upscale condom targeting both men and women with a soft touch, aloe lubricated latex in a unique portable carrying case. We are expanding offerings and distribution of the BATISTE brand leveraging its 2016 growth and #1 U.S. share position.“ Pension Settlement The Company plans to settle its U.K defined benefit pension plans in the second quarter of 2017 for an expected cash outlay (net of tax) of $14-$19 million. The Company estimates it will incur a one-time pre-tax expense of approximately $49 to $55 million upon settlement in 2017 ($0.16 to $0.18). The Company’s U.S. and Canadian plans were settled in previous years. The U.K. settlements will mark the completion of the Company’s plan to eliminate pension expense as a source of future earnings volatility. Sale of Brazilian Chemical Business In the fourth quarter, the Company decided to sell its chemical business (2016 net sales $22 million) in Brazil in order to focus on its Brazilian consumer business, resulting in a $4.9 million ($0.02) charge. The Company expects to close the sale of the business in the first quarter of 2017, resulting in an additional charge of approximately $5 million ($0.02). Outlook for 2017 Mr. Farrell stated, “We expect the 2017 business environment to have higher levels of trade promotions, rising commodity costs and worsening foreign currency headwinds. However, we plan to deliver strong sales, cash and earnings growth with our balanced portfolio of value and premium products, the launch of innovative new products, aggressive productivity programs and tight management of overhead costs.” With regard to 2017, Mr. Farrell said, “We expect reported and organic sales growth of approximately 3% supported by our new product introductions. We expect reported and adjusted gross margin to expand by approximately 60 basis points despite rising commodity costs and foreign exchange headwinds. We expect to increase marketing spending to 12.3% of net sales, a 10 basis point increase, in support of our new products. SG&A is expected to increase 180 basis points, although once adjusted for the pension settlement and Brazil charges, the increase is 10 basis points to 12.7% of sales, largely due to amortization from the two new acquisitions. Including these charges, reported operating margin is expected to decline 120 basis points, but will expand 40 basis points when adjusted to exclude the pension and Brazil charges.” In conclusion, Mr. Farrell said, “We believe 2017 will be an exciting year for Church & Dwight based on our continued focus on innovation and confidence in gross margin expansion. On a reported basis, EPS is expected to be $1.72 to $1.74 per share, which includes a $0.02 negative impact from the Brazil charge, $0.16 to $0.18 negative impact from the pension settlement and a $0.03 positive impact from adopting the new options accounting standard. We expect to achieve 7% adjusted EPS growth or $1.89 per share. This outlook includes incremental marketing spending and $0.01 EPS dilution from transition expenses related to the recently closed acquisitions. The $1.89 outlook excludes the $0.03 EPS impact from the accounting change. The 2017 outlook equates to 8% currency neutral adjusted EPS growth excluding a 1% negative impact from foreign exchange. In 2017, we expect adjusted free cash flow to exceed adjusted net income as we have in previous years. For the first quarter, we expect reported and organic sales growth of approximately 1-2%, gross margin expansion and $0.46 EPS, a 7% increase. We expect EPS in the first half of 2017 to be flat as we significantly increase our second quarter marketing and trade in support of new product launches, especially our cat litter innovation.” Church & Dwight Co., Inc. will host a conference call to discuss fourth quarter and full year 2016 earnings results on February 7, 2017 at 12.30 p.m. Eastern time.

These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for the comparable GAAP measures. The following non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similar measures provided by other companies due to differences in methods of calculation and items and events being excluded. Organic Sales Growth: This press release provides information regarding organic sales growth, namely net sales growth excluding the effect of acquisitions and foreign exchange rate changes. Management believes that the presentation of organic sales growth is useful to investors because it enables them to assess, on a consistent basis, sales trends related to products that were marketed by the Company during the entirety of relevant periods, excluding the impact of acquisitions and excluding foreign exchange rate changes that are out of the control of, and do not reflect the performance of, the Company and management. Adjusted Gross Margin: This press release provides information regarding adjusted gross margin, namely gross margin excluding the effect of charges taken in 2016 and expected to be taken in 2017 related to the Brazilian Specialty Products business. We believe that excluding these charges from gross margin provides a useful measure of the Company’s ongoing operating performance and a more effective comparison to prior periods by excluding significant one-time events. Adjusted SG&A: This press release presents information regarding adjusted SG&A, namely selling, general and administrative expenses excluding settlement charges related to our Canadian pension in 2015 and expected to be taken in 2017 related to the Brazilian Specialty Products business and an expected settlement charge related to our U.K. pension. We believe that this metric enhances investors’ understanding of the Company’s year over year expenses by excluding certain significant one-time items. Adjusted Operating Income and Margin: This press release provides information regarding adjusted operating income and margin, which exclude the effect of charges taken in 2016 and expected to be taken in 2017 related to the Brazilian Specialty Products business and an expected settlement charge related to our U.K. pension. We believe that excluding these charges from operating income and margin provides a useful measure of the Company’s ongoing operating performance and a more effective comparison to prior periods by excluding significant one-time events. Adjusted EPS: This press release also presents adjusted EPS, namely, earnings per share calculated in accordance with GAAP, as adjusted to exclude significant one-time items that are not indicative of the Company’s period to period performance. We believe that this metric provides investors a useful perspective of underlying business trends and results and provides useful supplemental information regarding our year over year earnings per share growth. Forecasted adjusted EPS for 2017 excludes charges related to the Brazilian Specialty Products business and the settlement charges related to our U.K. pension, as well as the positive impact from the implementation of a new stock option accounting standard. Adjusted EPS for 2016 excludes charges related to the Brazilian Specialty Products business and adjusted EPS for 2015 excludes a settlement charge related to our Canadian pension and an impairment charge related to our Natronx joint venture. Free Cash Flow: Free cash flow is defined as cash from operating activities less capital expenditures. Management views free cash flow as an important measure because it is one factor in determining the amount of cash available for dividends and discretionary investment. Adjusted Free Cash Flow as Percentage of Adjusted Net Income: Adjusted free cash flow as percentage of adjusted net income is defined as the ratio of free cash flow to net income excluding the Brazilian Specialty Products business and the settlement charges related to our U.K. pension, as well as the positive impact from the implementation of a new stock option accounting standard. Management views this as a measure of how effective the Company manages its cash flow relating to working capital and capital expenditures.   CHURCH & DWIGHT CO., INC.

Its unique oscillating, rotating and pulsating action moves up to 48,800 times removing up to a 100 per cent more plaque vs a regular brush,” Oral-B R&D Expert Phillip Hundeshagen said in a statement. This results in significantly better oral health for consumers, he added. Part of the Procter & Gamble Company, Oral-B is a global leader in the over USD 5 billion global brushing market.

"Al tiempo que siguen las guerras de talento mundiales y la competición por contratar es fiera, es vital que las organizaciones inviertan en empleo de marca para atraer a los nuevos empleados. Aunque para muchos, esto es más sencillo decirlo que hacerlo. De hecho, en una reciente encuesta de consejo de administración de conferencias ha revelado esa retención, descubriendo la próxima generación de líderes, además de atraer a los principales talentos son las preocupaciones más destacadas para los consejeros delegados de Estados Unidos", comentó John Wilson, consejero delegado de WilsonHCG. "Las compañías que van a ganar en la atracción y mantenimiento de los empleados son las que van a construir una marca de empleo superior, y las organizaciones clasificadas con más nota en nuestro informe demuestran el tipo de participación, dedicación y transparencia necesarios para destacar como empleador destacado en el actual mercado de trabajo competitivo". El Top 100 Employment Brands Report de este año ha visto a varias de las compañías repetidoras dentro del Top Ten, demostrando un compromiso continuado con los esfuerzos de marca, además de a algunas empresas nuevas que subieron de forma rápida a través de las clasificaciones frente a otros años. Las marcas de empleo del Top Ten para 2017 incluyen a: General Electric, Johnson & Johnson, AT&T, General Mills, 3M, Goldman Sachs, General Motors, Procter & Gamble, CDW, Cisco Systems, Hilton Worldwide y Salesforce.com. Otros de los principales descubrimientos del informe incluyen: Consistencia en excelencia: Ha habido una evolución en el criterio de puntuación desde el año 2015, incluyendo el poner un énfasis mayor en las páginas de carreras y marketing de reclutamiento, además de añadir nuevas categorías de puntuación. Johnson & Johnson, General Mills y Goldman Sachs todas ellas se mantuvieron en las clasificaciones del Top Ten por tercera vez. Grandes espacios: El Top 100 de la lista consiguió un resultado de casi dos veces mejor que el de los 100 puestos de más abajo. De hecho, el Top 100 puntuó más de 10 veces mejor que los 100 de más abajo en la categoría de logros, y casi cinco veces mejor en marketing de reclutamiento. Los líderes además puntuaron un 225% mejor que en la categoría Corporate Social Responsibility, que tiene una importancia creciente para los empleados en la actualidad, y después se clasificó mejor que los 100 puestos de más abajo en las páginas de carreras, revisiones de empleados y experiencia de candidatos. De forma adicional, las compañías de Fortune 500 con una clasificación de empleo de marca dentro del Top 10 disponen de unos ingresos combinados cuatro veces superiores a los de las organizaciones clasificadas entre las 10 de más abajo. El mayor salto: MassMutual Financial Group subió 36 puntos en el informe Employment Brand en comparación con el año anterior, pasando hasta el puesto 99 frente al puesto 472 del informe anterior. El informe WilsonHCG 2017 Top 100 Employment Brands Report clasifica a las compañías dentro de Fortune 500 basándose en un sistema de puntos que evalúa los criterios clave que incluyen páginas de carrera, trabajos de comités de asesoramiento, revisiones de los empleados y dedicación de candidatos, logros, marketing de reclutamiento y responsabilidad social empresarial.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Jena McGregor By Jena McGregor February 6 Follow @jenamcgregor One of the most-discussed ads during the Super Bowl Sunday night was not about football, beer or food. It was an Audi ad about the gender pay gap, featuring a dad watching his little girl competing in a cart race and questioning whether she'd be compensated equally when she grows up. "What do I tell my daughter?" the narrator asks. The spot was praised and pilloried. "Lean In" author Sheryl Sandberg, posting about it on Facebook, said "now more than ever, we need ads like this which push back on gender stereotypes," while high-profile Twitter users and consumers hailed the ad for its message. But it also received heaping criticism, with more dislikes than likes on YouTube and, as of late last week, more negative than positive comments, according to a research firm cited by the Wall Street Journal, many of them questioning the basis of a gender pay gap. "This whole commercial is based off a lie," one wrote on YouTube. "Women don't make less than men. Total propaganda." (The gender wage gap is a complex topic, which can be primarily explained by differences in industry and occupation choice, hours worked, and gaps for taking time off to have children. But researchers have also repeatedly found that part of the gap that remains is "unexplained" or unaccounted for by any of these factors.) The brouhaha over Audi's "Daughter" spot provided a data point to those wondering how the "femvertising" trend of recent years -- the move by brands like Dove, Always and Pantene to embrace gender empowerment themes in their ads -- might fare in the aftermath of such a divisive presidential campaign and amid heightened politicization of seemingly any corporate speech. Brands, after all, now find themselves navigating two different movements: Consumers are threatening boycotts and backlash any time a brand wades into seemingly political turf, while voices from the right appear emboldened after the election, criticizing topics that invited much less public controversy in the past. Yet at the same time, the worldwide Women's March provided a massive counterpoint, demonstrating a powerful force and dynamic response that have elevated women's issues in the national conversation. [Boycotts. Backlash. Breitbart. U.S. companies confront a volatile political climate] Former Wall Street executive Sallie Krawcheck pointed to both in a recent interview. On the one hand, she's found online comments to her writing on gender issues transformed from professional and polite before the election to angry and contradictory after it was over. Yet in surveys of professional women, she's also seen them say again and again that they want to take action. "There seems to be sort of an awakening, not just from the election, that we didn't make as much progress as we thought we did," she told The Washington Post in January. "There's a different energy among professional women right now." Samantha Skey, president and chief revenue officer of SheKnows Media, a digital media company that run an awards program for such women-focused campaigns, thinks such ads will continue for brands where it makes sense. "It's just going to invite more discussion because it's going to seem political," she says. Internal efforts to improve gender diversity at agencies, combined with the long-term trend of brands being armed with more and more data to reach their target customers, could also play a role in their expansion. "There is no middle right now," Skey says. [Why the highest-ranking woman on Wall Street says women shouldn't try to be like men at work] Susie Nam, chief operating officer at Droga5, the agency behind Under Armour's "I Will What I Want" women's campaign, agrees the trend will continue. "I think there will be more of it," she says. The brands that succeed will be those that tap into "a really deep-rooted emotional core" and "deep insights about how we're socialized to behave in a certain way," rather simply latching onto the latest marketing trend. She cites the "Like a Girl" campaign for Procter & Gamble's Always feminine products as one example that embraced the concept credibly. "If you can get to that level of insight, where there's no dispute, it becomes interesting." While ads explicitly focused on gender issues will continue, they could also become more subtle, where a female CEO is featured, say, but equality is not the core theme. " 'Normvertising' is probably what's going to come next," Skey said. Meanwhile, young 'Generation Z' consumers remain concerned about discrimination issues of other groups, too. "I think the Women's March is an opening in a lot of ways, not only for 'femvertising,' but an embrace of non-marginalization," Skey said. Both Nam and Skey note that structural changes in advertising agencies could also be a catalyst. Skey points to General Mills, which began pressuring the agencies it works with to have more gender-balanced teams last year. And Nam said that internal work at agencies like her own to confront unconscious biases, particularly in a male-dominated industry, is likely to create more awareness of those issues in the work they produce. Asking questions like " 'why did I think, when we need gravitas in that CEO, that it needed to be a man?' start to permeate the work that gets out into the world. It's an inside-out effort," she says.  A spokeswoman for Audi of America could not confirm whether the carmaker has a policy like General Mills' in place, but pointed to other gender initiatives at the company. The company signed the Obama White House's Equal Pay Pledge, has instituted a graduate internship program where 50 percent of enrollment must be female, and has made other external efforts to grow female leaders in fields such as science and the arts. [It's 2016, and women still make less for doing the same work as men] Still, some critics noted that Audi's executive team is largely male, with just two women on its senior leadership team in the United States and no women on its global management board. In an emailed statement, Audi of America vice president of marketing Loren Angelo said "we also will put aggressive hiring and development strategies in place to increase the number of women in our workforce, at all levels." Budweiser faced similar questions about its senior management team and internal practices when it launched a campaign last year featuring comedians Amy Schumer and Seth Rogen sounding off about equal pay. Though that may read to some as hypocritical, Skey thinks Audi's message will still likely resonate with its upscale target customer. "If you see a middle-of-the-road brand approaching this strategy, it is more risky," she says. "I don't doubt that Audi did this with eyes wide open about who it was going to alienate and who it was going to ingratiate."

TheStreet Staff Feb 6, 2017 12:16 PM EST The new Braun Series 9 shaver claims to be the "best shaver in the world" and the "epitome of premium craftsmanship." The company says it took 60 engineers to develop the electric razor. The new razor supposedly delivers 40,000 cross-cutting actions every minute. According to maker Procter & Gamble (PG) , the Series 9 has been "torture-tested" on three-day-old beards. The electric shaver category could use a dose of cool. Last year alone, said Nielsen, sales of electric shavers for men dived 8.7% to $147 million. By comparison, sales of men's disposable razors dropped 5.9% last year to $1.2 billion, capping an end to over three years of solid growth. This article was written by a staff member of TheStreet.

Of particular concern for some analysts is the recent weakness in beverage sales at convenience stores (C-store). Wells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog said fourth-quarter C-store sales were up 4.1% from a year ago, but that was “significantly below recent trends,” and comes off “exceptional growth” of 8% last year, partly resulting from “significantly lower” promotions. Read more about Wells Fargo’s recent downgrade of Coke. Herzog said she estimates that beverage promotions were up 0.1% during the fourth quarter, down from 0.6% growth in the third quarter and from a 1.2% rise in the second quarter. And Coke’s results could also face headwinds of the recent sharp drop in nonalcoholic beverage sales trends, which she estimates fell to 2.6% growth in the fourth quarter, from a 3.9% increase in the third quarter a 5.0% rise in the second quarter. Here’s what investors can expect from Thursday’s report: Earnings: Coke KO, -1.62%  is expected to report earnings excluding nonrecurring items of 37 cents a share for the quarter to Dec. 31, according to the average estimate of 21 analysts surveyed by FactSet. That is down from 38 cents a share in the same period a year ago. The FactSet earnings-per-share consensus has declined from 38 cents as of the end of the third quarter on Sept. 30. FactSet Estimize, a crowdsourcing platform that gathers estimates from Wall Street analysts, as well as buy-side analysts, hedge-fund managers, company executives, academics and others, has a consensus earnings-per-share estimate of 38 cents, based on 83 estimates. Based on Coke’s recent performance, there is a good chance that the quarterly streak of year-over-year earnings declines will be snapped, as Coke has beat the FactSet EPS consensus that past eight quarters by an average of about 2 cents a share. If Coke follows that same pattern, EPS could rise by a penny. Revenue: The FactSet revenue consensus is $9.14 billion, down from $10.01 billion in the same quarter last year. Those crowdsourced by Estimize are projecting, on average, revenue of $9.16 billion. As of Sept. 30, the FactSet consensus was $9.19 billion. Coke beat the FactSet revenue consensus in the previous quarter, and in six of the past eight quarters. Stock price: The stock has been trending lower since peaking at a record close of $46.89 on April 4, 2016. It had lost as much as 14% to a 14-month low close of $40.17 on Dec. 1, before bouncing slightly since then. The stock has fallen on the day that the past three quarterly reports were released, by an average of 2.7%, and the past five of six quarterly reports, by an average of 1.8%. The stock 0.3% on Wednesday, but has lost 10% since its record close, and 2% since the election. Meanwhile, shares of rival PepsiCo Inc. PEP, +0.12%  have gained 1.8% since April 4, 2016 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.48%  has surged 13%. Analysts are mostly bullish on the outlook for Coke’s stock. The average rating of the analysts surveyed by FactSet was the equivalent of overweight, while the average stock price target of $44.68 was 6.3% above current prices. Don’t miss: It’s time to sell Coca-Cola and P&G stocks, Goldman says. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. BRK.B, -0.02%  is Coca-Cola’s largest shareholder, with 400 million shares, or 9.3% of the shares outstanding, as of Sept. 30, according to FactSet. Other issues: Coke will likely continue to blame the strengthening of the U.S. dollar as one of the big reasons for the year-over-year decline in sales. In the third-quarter report, net sales fell 7%, but “organic” revenue, excluding the negative effect of currency--a 2% headwind--and acquisitions and divestitures, rose 3%. See also: Coca-Cola’s new CEO should making acquiring Monster a business priority. The ICE Dollar Index, which measures the U.S. dollar against a basket of currencies of major trading partners, soared 7.1% during the fourth quarter, and ended 2016 3.7% above where it ended 2015. Investors may also be on the lookout for comments on pricing, and how that might have impacted sales, as Wells Fargo’s Herzog said a survey of retailers indicated Coke raised prices the most during the fourth quarter for nonalcoholic beverages, and are expected to raise them the most in 2017. Here's what's behind the whiskey boom in the U.S.(3:46) Whiskey suppliers' gross revenues reached $8.1 billion in 2015 and are estimated to have grown further in 2016. The surging demand for whiskey in the U.S. has led to a boom in craft distilleries opening up across the country. Among some other financial metrics Coke is expected to report, according to FactSet: • Sales for the North America region: $2.39 billion • Sales for Latin America: $995.0 million • Sales for Pacific: $992.0 million • Volume growth in North America: -0.5% • Volume growth in Latin America: -0.1% • Volume growth in Asia Pacific: +1.3% More from MarketWatch Super Bowl Ad: Lexus This little-noticed phenomenon could make stock picking great again Super Bowl Ad: Mercedes Related Topics Earnings Markets U.S. Stocks Quote References KO -0.67 -1.62% PEP +0.13 +0.12% DJIA +96.97 +0.48% BRK.B -0.03 -0.02% Most Popular Dow, S&P 500, Nasdaq book records, log 3rd straight weekly gain Trump administration begins immigration raids across the U.S. Amazon.com takes aim at Victoria’s Secret with its own $10 bras Beastly Nvidia earnings beaten by burden of high expectations Marijuana tax revenue hit $200 million in Colorado as sales pass $1 billion Tomi Kilgore Tomi Kilgore is MarketWatch's deputy investing and corporate news editor and is based in New York.

More than 1,200 3- and 4-year-olds received such burns in that time period, according to the research published Thursday in the medical journal JAMA Ophthalmology. Single-dose detergent packs, known as laundry packets or pods, entered the mass market in 2012. “Each pod consists of a detergent mixture wrapped in a water-soluble film, made up of a proprietary polyvinyl alcohol polymer,” said Eric J. Moorhead, president and principal scientist of Good Chemistry LLC, a consulting firm. “The liquid detergent in the pods is not the same as regular liquid detergent. It has a higher concentration of surfactants, chemicals that are responsible for stain removal,” said Moorhead, who was not involved in the new study. “At high concentrations, these ordinarily safe ingredients can cause irritation, especially in sensitive areas like the eyes.” ‘Among the worst chemicals’ Among kids between 3 and 4 years old, the number of chemical burns in the eye caused by laundry detergent packets increased from 12 instances in 2012 to 480 in 2015. Proportionally, the total chemical eye injuries associated with the packets increased from 0.8% of all burns in 2012 to 26% in 2015. Children can injure themselves when the packets break and the contents squirt into one or both eyes, or when the contents leak onto the children’s hands and they rub their eyes. Most of these burns happened in the home, where kids are playing with the brightly colored packets, “wondering if they’re toys, if they’re candy,” said the lead researcher, Dr. R. Sterling Haring of Johns Hopkins University. They’re neither. The detergents inside the pods “are among the worst chemicals that the eye can be exposed to,” Haring said: Detergents are alkaline in nature, and alkaline burns are typically more severe than acid burns in the eye. “They penetrate deeper, they burn faster, and they are more caustic to the tissues in the eye itself.” Because the cornea doesn’t have blood vessels, it doesn’t heal well, so if you scar it with detergent packet chemicals, “there’s a high risk of long-term vision impairment,” Haring said. “We’d done another study a few months ago that showed that small children are at highest risk for all types of chemical ocular burns, and that kind of flew in the face of conventional wisdom,” he said. “They always thought that working-age men were the highest risk group: working in factories, splashing chemical in their eyes.” Instead, he and his colleagues were surprised to find that young children have a 50% higher risk than the highest-risk adult, Haring said. Once that news got out, community physicians insisted that the cause was laundry detergent packets. Haring and his team discovered that they were right. Their study concludes with recommendations that parents properly store these packets and that manufacturers consider new, redesigned packaging. In essence, these recommendations “are already in play,” said Brian Sansoni, vice president of sustainability initiatives at the American Cleaning Institute, which represents the US cleaning products industry. He said the new study analyzed data prior to the new safety standards that were published in December 2015 by ASTM International, formerly American Society for Testing and Materials International, a non-profit that develops voluntary consensus standards for consumer manufacturers. The American Cleaning Institute helped identify proper standards for the packets. Following publication of the safety standards, Procter & Gamble, the company that makes Gain and Tide brand laundry detergent pods, launched ad campaigns to raise awareness of the dangers and made its packaging more difficult for small children to open. Other companies also followed suit. “Make sure you keep these products up and away from children — like a lot of household products,” said Sansoni. What should parents do? Dr. Michael Grosso, chairman of the department of pediatrics and chief medical officer at Northwell Health’s Huntington Hospital in Huntington, New York, said parents need to worry about these laundry packets and keep them out of the way. “It’s not only eye injuries. Children will also swallow these,” said Grosso, who was not involved in the study. Eye injuries caused by the packets “can be quite serious,” he added. “The majority of individuals will recover their vision after this kind of injury,” he said. However, these burns can be “very, very painful. They require extensive emergency treatment and extensive follow-up treatment by an ophthalmologist.” The first thing parents should do is “prevent this by keeping these pods out of the way. They need to be kept up high in cabinets beyond the reach of a preschool child, the group that’s most at risk.” If a child does get detergent in their eye, a parent should immediately irrigate the child’s eyes. “Cool tap water, as much as possible, as soon as possible,” Grosso said. “And then the very next step would be a trip to the emergency department.” Haring echoed this advice. “Take your child and put their eye under cool water under the faucet and flush it with cool water for 20 minutes,” he said, noting that if the burn is extremely severe, some loss of vision could occur. “Don’t stop and take them to the hospital. Don’t call and wait for an ambulance to show up. Flush the eye with cool water before you do anything else,” Haring said. “That’s going to be the deciding factor about long-term outcome for this injury.” Filed in: News Suggest a correction × Suggest A Correction Your name Your email Report a typo or grammatical error Cancel Share this: Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest LinkedIn Email Leave a Reply Cancel reply Enter your comment here...

It's a trend that comScore executive Aaron Fetters is seeing on the buy side--along with a keen desire to clean up "a mess" of an ecosystem. "We finally seem to be going a little bit beyond just the discussion of viewability and fraud and getting back to how does that combine with audience," Fetters says in an interview with Beet.TV at the IAB Annual Leadership Meeting. "I'm hearing the buy side really begin start to ask again am I getting the audience I thought I was buying." Now SVP, National Agencies & CPG Business at comScore, less than two years ago Fetters was on the buy side, as Director of Global Insights at the Kellogg Company. He thinks it's a positive sign that the industry seems to be moving beyond a sole concentration on viewability, fraud and eliminating waste. "It think we've probably made a lot of progress in beginning to eliminate a lot of the waste in the ecosystem, but now I'm seeing the attention turn back to it's not enough to just know that I'm getting a quality impression," Fetters says. "I want to know who's seeing that impression." Addressing the digital ad ecosystem, Fetters expects the consolidation among ad tech providers to continue. "Clearly we're seeing it week after week, month after month," he says. It cannot happen fast enough, according to Fetters. "I think if you look at some of the campaigns that are running today, where you may have three, four, five, six tags on an ad to do various measures or activities against that ad or to collect data. Marketers are realizing this is too much and this is a mess," he says. Alluding to remarks at the IAB event by Procter & Gamble Chief Brand Officer Mark Pritchard, Fetters acknowledges that marketers have mostly allowed the digital ad ecosystem to be managed for them. But that's changing. "Now they're kind of stepping up and saying how much of my working dollar is going against non-working activity and can I be more efficient with that," says Fetters. I think we're going to see a big move toward simplifying the execution of ad serving, how do we get ads in front of consumers." It's a question of necessity, according to Fetters, "because the buyers are starting to take notice, the buyers are starting to demand it." He says it's fascinating to see the expanding desire by brands to build more targeted TV plans to reach specific audiences. And while addressable or programmatic TV "may be not quite scalable today, it certainly is not stopping the same idea of using data to build television-based audience in a new way."

And for once that’s a good thing. 02/06/2017 11:13 am ET | Updated 4 days ago 3.3k Emily Peck Executive Editor, Business and Technology, The Huffington Post Forget Audi pitching pay equality: The most feminist ad of Superbowl this year was a Tide commercial in which not a single woman appears. The commercial was woven into Fox’s broadcast. Announcer Terry Bradshaw finds a barbecue stain on his shirt, dips out of the game and races to actor Jeffrey Tambor’s house. The 72-year-old actor helpfully washes the ex-NFL players clothes while they both hang on the couch.  For years men have been largely ignored by the makers of laundry detergent, who aimed their marketing voodoo squarely at women. A more typical Tide commercial would involve a mother desperate to remove the grass stains on her son’s soccer shorts or perhaps a beautiful lady prancing through a backyard sniffing freshly-laundered sheets off the line. Sunday night’s ad acknowledging laundry as a man’s chore is a small but welcome step for gender equality. Yet, the commercial that caught everyone’s attention Sunday night was a more nakedly feminist spot for Audi. In the car company’s commercial a father muses on the opportunities that may one day be available to his young daughter. “What do I tell my daughter? Do I tell her that despite her education, her drive, her skills, her intelligence, she’ll automatically be valued as less than every man she meets?” Audi ends the ad by broadcasting its commitment to equal pay. Equal pay for equal work is obviously important. But so is equality at home: If that little girl is going to make it out there in the world, she needs a partner at home who takes on his (or her) share of the housework. The burden of housework, however, still falls mostly on women. Even though women represent 47 percent of the workforce and an overwhelming majority of women with kids at home are employed, they still do much more of the housework, according to data from the Labor Department. The so-called extra-shift holds them back outside the home. It is partly the reason women are still so hard to find in the upper echelons of the business and political spheres. Women “face two glass ceilings, one at work and one at home,” a news story in Bloomberg noted in 2015. “Until that changes, the number of women advancing to high-level positions isn’t likely to go anywhere.” The Tide commercial is a strong signal that change is happening. Men are slowly taking on more household tasks. What’s happening with laundry marks an “epic change,” Ellen Byron of The Wall Street Journal reported last year ― after Tide put out a similarly male-focused commercial featuring Emmitt Smith. Sixty-seven percent of men between ages 18 - 34 were responsible for cleaning their own clothes in 2014, up from 44 percent the previous year, according to data cited by the Wall Street Journal. Older men, age 55 and up, mainly leave the task to their wives. Just 35 percent do their own wash, according to the data. Companies, including Procter & Gamble, which makes Tide, are slowly catching on. There’s an increasing number of laundry products aimed squarely at guys. In part because Americans are waiting longer to marry, men are often faced with a pile of dirty clothes and no one to help them with it. Changes in expectations for men and women take a lot of time, however. The Super Bowl still featured ads, like this one from GM, where dudes get distracted by a super model. There was also an ad for Mr. Clean Sunday night that some viewed as feminist. In it a man cleans the house and in the process totally turns on his wife. That’s progress of a sort, but if we lived in a world where chores were shared more equally the ad wouldn’t have been such a surprise.

The teaser generated some 307,000 mentions during the game, according to social-media measurement firm Amobee. More On: super bowl commercials Man proposes to girlfriend in Super Bowl commercial Budweiser’s Super Bowl ad was the most-watched online Tom Brady called his shot What was 84 Lumber thinking with its Super Bowl ad? Coming in second place was wireless carrier T-Mobile, which spent big buying up three minutes of ad time featuring Justin Bieber, Martha Stewart and Snoop Dogg. T-Mobile got 91,000 tweet mentions in return. Verizon, Sprint and T-Mobile all mobilized their social-media teams to attack each other during the Super Bowl. “Here are some moves @tmobile doesn’t want you to see,” tweeted Verizon about T-Mobile’s Justin Bieber spot, which asked viewers to tweet their Super Bowl touchdown dances. T-Mobile shot back, “Hate to break it to you. but T-Mobile One won’t punish you with overages.” In third place came Procter & Gamble’s Mr. Clean, which won 80,800 mentions during the event. In a piece that paid a nod to the joke that a woman’s porn is a man who cleans, a woman watches Mr. Clean scrub her house in a tight, white outfit while she ogles his body. Mr. Clean then turns into a regular guy and the woman runs over to kiss him after he sweeps the floor. Other brands that stirred conversation included Airbnb, which used a Super Bowl ad and the hashtag “#We Accept” to let the world know about its support of refugees. Coke’s “America the Beautiful” ad and Audi’s equal-pay spot also reached the top of the Twitter charts, as did Anheuser-Busch’s ad about its 19th-Century immigrant founder.

Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 6 February 2017 by Military News Sofia Vergara Reveals the Secret to Unbelievably Beautiful Hair CINCINNATI–(BUSINESS WIRE)–While it’s no secret that Sofia Vergara has used Head & Shoulders for over 20 years, many women still don’t believe that an anti-dandruff shampoo can provide cosmetic benefits that give Sofia, well, Sofia Vergara hair. The latest ad campaign from Head & Shoulders features Sofia revealing the unbelievable truth about the NEW Head & Shoulders 3 Action Formula – it does give her soft, smooth, healthy and great-smelling hair, while also keeping her scalp flake free. It’s the ultimate beauty secret for hair that’s super soft and full of life. Marion Cohen, Creative Director at Saatchi & Saatchi London, shares, „Sofia is an award winning actress, producer and business woman loved by millions, who has access to the most sought after treatments and expensive products, so it’s hard to believe (but true!) that she uses Head & Shoulders in real life. We felt this fact could make for a compelling story. It has great comic potential, which suits Sofia’s personality, but is also an amazing claim for the brand. We wanted the ad to feel like we’ve captured a real moment so the claim would come across as genuine.” So, how does the new formula give Sofia hair that’s full of life? Inspired by skincare products that contain optimized particles, Head & Shoulders scientists began a journey to create smaller zinc particles in the formula. After over 10 years of exploration and clinical studies, the 3 Action Formula was developed with micro zinc mineral particles that cleanse, protect and moisturize the scalp, creating a stronger foundation for more resilient, beautiful hair. Cleanses – Contains a gentle cleansing agent that provides a rich, deeply indulgent lather, while offering best in class dandruff protection. Protects – Micro zinc particles deposit deep into the scalp pore and are left behind – even after rinsing – improving the scalp’s condition and enabling long-lasting dandruff protection. Moisturizes – Formula locks in moisture to improve the scalp barrier, maintaining hydrated, strengthened and toned skin. Conditioning agents also provide smoother, softer and more manageable hair, resulting in less breakage over time. Head & Shoulders 3 Action Formula is Sofia’s ultimate beauty secret for hair that’s flake free and full of life. Starting this month, it can be found in all Head & Shoulders shampoo and conditioner collections, which are available at food, drug and mass market retailers nationwide. For more information, please visit headandshoulders.com.

The list of standout Super Bowl LI ads was derived through scientific calculation of audience ratings (minimum 500 U.S. viewers per ad) and verbatim comments on creative attributes such as attention, likeability, relevance, change, polarity, and emotion. “The country has been through an endless political food fight for more than a year and it appears that the largest television viewing audience was anxious for some relief, rather than more preaching, and most brands gauged that mood correctly,” said Peter Daboll, CEO of Ace Metrix. This year’s creative crop was heavy on celebrities, humor (some lighthearted, some borderline gross), and entertaining visuals – and relatively light on struggle, charitable endeavors, and controversy -- although there were a few. “The problem with ads that inflict some sort of political opinion on the audience, just like campaign ads themselves is that they are ineffective in swaying opinions which by now are heavily dug in. Whatever side of the political spectrum, you either wholeheartedly agree, or adamantly disagree.” Daboll continued, “For advertisers, this approach is fraught with risk because no brand actually seeks to push half their potential audience away. Most brands that dole out the big dollars for Super Bowl airtime have the objective of speaking (and selling) to a huge, diverse, mass market. Yes, we consumers want our brands to stand for something, but if the stand is controversial, like hiring a polarizing celebrity, it can offend much of your target.” There were some ads that took a ‘piling on politics’ penalty, particularly 84 Lumber, a newbie to Super Bowl advertising. A few brands that treaded carefully on edgy topics were successful. When rated by an audience representative of the general population, these ads (such as Audi’s “Daughter” or Budweiser’s “Born the Hard Way”) show very little viewer disagreement. In fact, viewers ranked “Daughter” as one of the best-liked and least polarizing ads of this year’s game. Likewise, beer drinkers responded favorably to Budweiser’s origin story, slightly higher than Bud Light’s “Ghost Spuds.” Ace Metrix data also revealed an unusual trend in Super Bowl advertising – brands leveraging the Super Bowl audience, but re-running ads that have previously aired. Big names such as Google Home, Coke, Wendy’s, Fiji Water, Airbnb, and Sprite took this approach in 2017. These ads were excluded from Ace Metrix rankings, as they did not represent original Super Bowl creative. The best Super Bowl LI ads, as rated by American audiences, were those that took a lighthearted approach to everyday life – those that sought to entertain through visuals, relatable storytelling, and/or humor and in Nintendo’s case, a great product. The Standouts of Super Bowl LI These ads exhibited broad audience appeal, likeable visuals and characters, and relevant, often funny, storylines. These were also the least polarizing, which is appropriate for the huge, diverse Super Bowl audience.

Honorable Mentions: Avocados from Mexico Secret Society :30 Google Home Surprise 1:00 The Surprises of Super Bowl LI These well-received creative efforts were new entries to the Super Bowl and delivered a surprise or change in direction to viewers. In particular, Nintendo was able to demonstrate an innovative new product with an entertaining ad that viewers responded to. Procter & Gamble’s humorous and somewhat edgy Mr. Clean, and even “Halftime Bathroom Break” worked across demographics.

This is at least in part due to the fact that it was only a partial ad that directed viewers to their website to view the final 3.25 minutes. Squarespace’s :30 “Calling JohnMalkovich.com” just wasn’t able to communicate information clearly (their:60 digital ad performed much better), and finally, Sprint’s humor attempt fell flat (father faking his own death). Several viewers were offended at the “daddy’s dead” levity in an audience that contains children. Snickers deserves some credit for staging the first ever “live” Super Bowl ad, however, by the time viewers caught up to the storyline, it was over. “Ironically this ad might have benefited by having more frequency for the viewers to appreciate the comical storyline,” said Peter Daboll.

Of the hundreds of companies analyzed, General Electric and Johnson & Johnson scored highest based on six key employment branding indicators. "As the global talent wars continue to heat up and competition for hiring is fierce, it's critical for organizations to invest in employment branding to attract new employees. Yet for many, this is easier said than done. In fact, a recent Conference Board survey revealed that retention, finding the next generation of leaders, and attracting top talent are the top concerns for U.S. CEOs," said John Wilson, CEO of WilsonHCG. "The companies that will win at attracting and retaining employees are those that build a great employment brand, and the organizations that ranked highest in our report demonstrate the type of participation, engagement and transparency that's required to stand out as a top employer in today's competitive job market." This year's Top 100 Employment Brands Report saw a number of repeat companies in the Top Ten, demonstrating a continued commitment to branding efforts, as well as some newcomers that rose quickly through the ranks from previous years. The Top Ten employment brands for 2017 include: General Electric, Johnson & Johnson, AT&T, General Mills, 3M, Goldman Sachs, General Motors, Procter & Gamble, CDW, Cisco Systems, Hilton Worldwide, and Salesforce.com. Other key findings from the report include: Consistency in Excellence: There was an evolution to the scoring criteria since 2015, including placing greater emphasis on career pages and recruitment marketing as well as adding new scoring categories, Johnson & Johnson, General Mills and Goldman Sachs all hung onto their Top Ten rankings for a third time. Big Gaps: The top 100 on the list performed almost two times better than the bottom 100. In fact, the top 100 scored more than 10 times better than the bottom 100 in the accolades category, and almost five times better in recruitment marketing. The leaders also scored 225 percent better in the Corporate Social Responsibility category, which is of growing importance to today's employees, and they outranked the bottom 100 on career pages, job boards, employee reviews and candidate experience. Additionally, Fortune 500 companies with a top 10 employment brand ranking had combined revenues four times greater than organizations ranked in the bottom 10. Biggest Jump: MassMutual Financial Group rose 36 points in the Employment Brand report compared to the prior year, moving to rank at 99 from 472 in the prior report. The WilsonHCG 2017 Top 100 Employment Brands Report ranks Fortune 500 companies based on a points system that evaluates key criteria including career pages, job boards, employee reviews and candidate engagement, accolades, recruitment marketing and corporate social responsibility. Companies can earn up to 100 points, with greater weight given to key areas of importance in employer branding, such as employee reviews and candidate engagement due to its influence and significance in the recruitment journey.

Without the boundaries of a brick and mortar classroom constraining enrollment, the college’s online programs have laid the foundation for a global, diverse network of Mountaineers from 49 states and nine countries. The college’s integrated marketing communications (IMC) program is a pioneer in online education. IMC was the first accredited online master’s degree of its kind in the world. Launched in 2003, the initial class had just 17 people. Today, IMC is WVU’s largest graduate program with nearly 500 active students. The goal of the program is to teach a blend of theoretical grounding and practical skills that students need to build, implement and measure integrated marketing communications campaigns in today’s dynamic digital environment. With more than 20 electives to choose from, students are also able to customize their degrees to fit their specific career goals. The online, accommodating nature of the program is designed to fit the busy lifestyle of working professionals, giving more people access to a graduate education in the Mountain State and across the world. “What attracted me to the IMC program is that it allowed me the flexibility to continue to do what I love the most, which is being a mom,” says Michelle Troutman, manager of integrated marketing communications at LORD Corporation in Erie, PA. “In addition, I learned those skills that I needed to advance my career.” Most students enter the program with some professional experience, but the range is expansive, including people with little to no professional communications experience to those with nearly 30 years. “With this nontraditional education environment, so much becomes possible,” says Chad Mezera, director of online programs. “The online format allows students from all different backgrounds across the world to collaborate and learn.” The IMC program is characterized by small class sizes, personalized attention and access to the most current thinking and innovative methods in the industry. Students learn from faculty who are recognized leaders in their fields, bringing experience to the classroom from numerous notable brands, including Procter & Gamble, Coca-Cola, Rubbermaid, McDonald’s, Sony, Verizon, General Motors, Hallmark, Nestle, Kimberly Clark and Yum! Brands. IMC has long been recognized by marketing communications leaders for its practical, industry-focused approach. The program was named a finalist in the PRWeek US Awards 2016 Education Program of the Year category. In 2015, the program was named the Outstanding Online Program by the Online Learning Consortium, the leading professional organization devoted to advancing the quality of online learning worldwide. In 2016, the college added an additional master’s degree, data marketing communications (DMC), in response to a critical industry need for data-savvy communicators. Students in the DMC program will learn how to decipher and use audience data to drive marketing communications messaging. Dedicated to expanding access to education, the College of Media holds a marketing communications conference called INTEGRATE at least once per year in different locations throughout the U.S. This year, INTEGRATE will be held in Huntington, WV, and provide professionals from across the Mountain State and the country with the latest integrated marketing communications techniques and strategies.   About the Author Allyson Kennedy is the communications manager of online programs for WVU’s Reed College of Media.

Trax Image Recognition has completed a $ 19.5 million financing round led by Investec Bank. Trax will use this investment to expand its global operations with a focus in products and services for top tier retailers. Founded in 2010 by CEO Joel Bar-El and chief commercial officer Dror Feldheim, Trax has raised nearly $100 million since its incepetion. Headquartered in Singapore, more than half the company's employees are in its Tel Aviv development center. RELATED ARTICLES Israeli image recognition for retail co Trax raises $40m Trax has developed a computer vision platform that turns retail shelf images into real-time actionable insights. Analyzing over 8 million images every month (representing a quarter of a billion products captured and analyzed monthly), Trax provides the highest accuracy of data, intelligence, insights and recommendations to consumer good companies and retailers in over 45 countries. “Experience has told us that a small unlisted company that was able to attract multi-nationals including Coca-Cola, Nestle, Proctor & Gamble and AB InBev, must have a product and service worthy of closer attention,” said Richard Forlee, head of Investec’s Asian principal and private equity operations. “When we met the managers and realised the extent of their expertise for such a young business, we were convinced about investing in the company. We believe that Trax’s research and development capability and some of the ongoing work in artificial intelligence, automation and machine learning is a source of great potential.” Bar-El said, “Given Investec’s strong track record in growth capital investments, and its involvement in international wealth management and asset management, Trax is very excited to have Investec join as a shareholder as we prepare for our next phase of global growth and innovation." Feldheim said, “We jumpstarted 2017 at NRF’s Big Show in New York, where we were incredibly excited to see the reception of our technology with global retailers. Retailers are eager to see the kinds of data and insights that Trax can provide to not only address store fundamentals, but to drive overall category performance in the store."

Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 6 February 2017 by Military News Ace Metrix Names Lightheartedness the Key to Super Bowl LI Advertising Success LOS ANGELES–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Ace Metrix, the leader in measuring the impact of television and digital advertising, released results of its analysis of yesterday’s Super Bowl LI ads, which revealed that this year, Americans overwhelmingly embraced lighthearted, relatable, entertainment over heavy emotion, messaging, and controversial topics. The list of standout Super Bowl LI ads was derived through scientific calculation of audience ratings (minimum 500 U.S. viewers per ad) and verbatim comments on creative attributes such as attention, likeability, relevance, change, polarity, and emotion. “The country has been through an endless political food fight for more than a year and it appears that the largest television viewing audience was anxious for some relief, rather than more preaching, and most brands gauged that mood correctly,” said Peter Daboll, CEO of Ace Metrix. This year’s creative crop was heavy on celebrities, humor (some lighthearted, some borderline gross), and entertaining visuals – and relatively light on struggle, charitable endeavors, and controversy — although there were a few. “The problem with ads that inflict some sort of political opinion on the audience, just like campaign ads themselves is that they are ineffective in swaying opinions which by now are heavily dug in. Whatever side of the political spectrum, you either wholeheartedly agree, or adamantly disagree.” Daboll continued, “For advertisers, this approach is fraught with risk because no brand actually seeks to push half their potential audience away. Most brands that dole out the big dollars for Super Bowl airtime have the objective of speaking (and selling) to a huge, diverse, mass market. Yes, we consumers want our brands to stand for something, but if the stand is controversial, like hiring a polarizing celebrity, it can offend much of your target.” There were some ads that took a ‘piling on politics’ penalty, particularly 84 Lumber, a newbie to Super Bowl advertising. A few brands that treaded carefully on edgy topics were successful. When rated by an audience representative of the general population, these ads (such as Audi’s “Daughter” or Budweiser’s “Born the Hard Way”) show very little viewer disagreement. In fact, viewers ranked “Daughter” as one of the best-liked and least polarizing ads of this year’s game. Likewise, beer drinkers responded favorably to Budweiser’s origin story, slightly higher than Bud Light’s “Ghost Spuds.” Ace Metrix data also revealed an unusual trend in Super Bowl advertising – brands leveraging the Super Bowl audience, but re-running ads that have previously aired. Big names such as Google Home, Coke, Wendy’s, Fiji Water, Airbnb, and Sprite took this approach in 2017. These ads were excluded from Ace Metrix rankings, as they did not represent original Super Bowl creative. The best Super Bowl LI ads, as rated by American audiences, were those that took a lighthearted approach to everyday life – those that sought to entertain through visuals, relatable storytelling, and/or humor and in Nintendo’s case, a great product. The Standouts of Super Bowl LI These ads exhibited broad audience appeal, likeable visuals and characters, and relevant, often funny, storylines. These were also the least polarizing, which is appropriate for the huge, diverse Super Bowl audience. *Note: This ad ran during pre-game and post-game commercial breaks only. Honorable Mentions: Avocados from Mexico Secret Society :30 Google Home Surprise 1:00 The Surprises of Super Bowl LI These well-received creative efforts were new entries to the Super Bowl and delivered a surprise or change in direction to viewers. In particular, Nintendo was able to demonstrate an innovative new product with an entertaining ad that viewers responded to. Procter & Gamble’s humorous and somewhat edgy Mr. Clean, and even “Halftime Bathroom Break” worked across demographics. The Flops of Super Bowl LI Poorly rated by Ace Metrix methodology (leveraging 500 new viewers for each ad), these spots were often more polarizing with questionable humor, low relevance, or seemingly nonsensical/hard to follow storylines in viewers’ eyes. 84 Lumber’s ad that aired on television was one of the poorest performers across all Super Bowl ads Ace Metrix has tested. This is at least in part due to the fact that it was only a partial ad that directed viewers to their website to view the final 3.25 minutes. Squarespace’s :30 “Calling JohnMalkovich.com” just wasn’t able to communicate information clearly (their :60 digital ad performed much better), and finally, Sprint’s humor attempt fell flat (father faking his own death). Several viewers were offended at the “daddy’s dead” levity in an audience that contains children. Snickers deserves some credit for staging the first ever “live” Super Bowl ad, however, by the time viewers caught up to the storyline, it was over. “Ironically this ad might have benefited by having more frequency for the viewers to appreciate the comical storyline,” said Peter Daboll. Ace Metrix measures ad creative effectiveness based on viewer reaction to video ads, providing the advertising industry an unbiased resource to measure creative impact. Ace Metrix scores every national television ad, and an expanding proportion of digital ads, across 96 categories creating a complete comparative database—Ace Metrix LIVE®.

The results are presented on a scale of 1–950, which represents scoring on creative attributes such as Attention, Likeability, Information, Change, Relevance, Desire and Watchability. Ace Metrix applies a natural language processing algorithm to the hundreds of qualitative verbatim responses collected for each ad, deriving additional metrics related to emotional engagement.

On advertising's biggest night, marketers took different tactics to appeal to the largest live TV-watching audience there is. They pay dearly for the opportunity — $5 million for 30 seconds to capture more than 110 million expected viewers — so it's crucial to connect. Some like Airbnb, Coca-Cola and the NFL introduced messages of the power of American diversity and inclusion. Others like Tide and T-Mobile stuck with trying to get laughs. Haircare brand "It's a 10" tried to do both at once. This image made from a video provided by Hyundai Motor America shows U.S. troops on U.S. military base in Zagan, Poland, watching Super Bowl 51 football game between the Atlanta Falcons and the New England Patriots in Houston during a party hosted by Hyundai. Hyundai aired an ad right after the Super Bowl that was recorded while the game was underway in Houston, Sunday, Feb. 5, 2017.

A few service members are called into a room, where they are connected virtually to their family members ¿ who are at the game. (Hyundai Motor America via AP) As the New England Patriots edged out the Atlantic Falcons on the field in Houston, Airbnb touted inclusiveness with an ad showing faces of different ethnicities and the copy: "We all belong. The world is more beautiful the more you accept." Coca-Cola aired a previously run ad in the pregame in which people sing "America the Beautiful" in different languages. Even a hair care brand dipped into politics: The "It's a 10" hair brand indirectly referenced President Donald Trump's famously unruly do in its Super Bowl spot. It's tough to be a Super Bowl advertiser in during any year. But this year, a divisive political climate has roiled the nation since Trump took office in January, making it even tougher for brands. "Anxiety and politics just loom over this game, so anybody who gives us the blessed relief of entertaining with a real Super Bowl commercial wins," said Mark DiMassimo, CEO of the ad agency DiMassimo Goldstein. Several ads aimed for just that. Tide, for instance, offered a humorous ad showing announcer Terry Bradshaw trying frantically to remedy a stain while his antics go "viral" online, with the help of New England Patriot Rob Gronkowski and actor Jeffrey Tambor. WALKING THE POLITICAL LINE "Brands used to worry about whether their ad could be interpreted as right or wrong," said Kelly O'Keefe, a marketing professor at Virginia Commonwealth University. "Now they have to worry about whether it will be interpreted as right or left." But there were still plenty of ads that walked the line. An NFL ad conveyed what all advertisers hope the Super Bowl becomes: a place where Americans can come together. "Inside these lines, we may have our differences, but recognize there's more that unites us," Forest Whitaker intoned in a voiceover as workers prepped a football field and gridiron scenes played. "The Super Bowl is shaping up as a counterpoint to the divisiveness in the United States," said Tim Calkins, a marketing professor at Northwestern University. Airbnb's ad was one of the more overtly political, showing a variety of different faces with the tagline "We accept." Some thought the ad was a hit. "Kudos to them for making a strong statement," said O'Keefe. But others, such as Villanova University marketing professor Charles Taylor, thought it didn't have a clear enough link to the brand and risked coming off as a "purely political statement." Some advertisers took the safest route possible by re-airing ads they've used before — an unusual, though not unprecedented, move. Coca-Cola, Google and Fiji water aired rerun ads. SURPRISES A debut Super Bowl spot by the "It's a 10" hair care brand introduced its line of men products by joking about Donald Trump's hair. "America, we're in for four years of awful hair, so it's up to you to do your part by making up for it with great hair," a voiceover stated as black-and-white photos of people with a wide array of hairstyles flashed past. "Do your part. ... Let's make sure these next four years are 'It's a 10.'" Snickers got tons of press by airing a live ad In the third quarter. On a Wild West set, actor Adam Driver seemed not to know the ad was live — and then the set fell apart (on purpose). "You ruin live Super Bowl commercials when you're hungry," the ad's tagline read. "It went by so fast, I almost missed it," DiMassimo said. "Not sure it was worth the trouble of doing it live." LIGHT HUMOR PLUS CELEBS Ads with light humor and stuffed with celebrities were popular. Honda's ad made a splash by animating the yearbook photos of nine celebrities ranging from Tina Fey to Viola Davis. They make fun of their photos — Jimmy Kimmel is dressed in a blue tux and holding a clarinet, for example — and talk about "The Power of Dreams," Honda's ad slogan. "It was a really good message and it was entertaining," said Mirta Desir, a New Orleans native who works in education and was watching the game on Long Island. The Tide ad with Terry Bradshaw was a hit with some viewers because of the way it tricked viewers into thinking it was part of the broadcast. "It made you think twice," said Pablo Rochat, watching in Atlanta. "There was funny dialogue and good storytelling." T-Mobile's spots — featuring Justin Bieber and Rob Gronkowski dancing , Kristen Schaal in a "50 Shades of Grey" parody and Martha Stewart and Snoop Dogg mixing talk about T-Mobile's unlimited-data plan with innuendos about Snoop's marijuana habit — won raves from some. As did an ad from antioxidant drink maker Bai featuring Justin Timberlake and Christopher Walken.

Finance Search $US's sudden weakness may help profit picAAP – Mon, Feb 6, 2017 3:13 PM AEDT Stock investors could have at least one less worry in the next earnings period: the suddenly limp US dollar. The greenback, whose strong rally after the November 8 US election hit profits at many US multinationals in the fourth quarter, has had a sharp reversal since the start of 2017. Coupled with comments suggesting that the Trump administration favours a weaker currency, that could shift the picture for the current quarter. Fourth-quarter results, even with the dollar's drag, are mostly beating Wall Street's expectations and helping provide a buffer to some of the uncertainties facing investors, including the new US president's policies. The S&P 500 ended with a slight gain for the week. With earnings in from more than half the S&P 500 companies, year-over-year profit growth for the fourth quarter is now estimated at 8.0 per cent, up from 6.1 per cent forecast at the start of January, and on track to be the strongest since the third quarter of 2014, according to Thomson Reuters data. Analysts expect first-quarter earnings to rise 11.5 per cent. That "sets the stage for a stronger Q1, particularly when you look at the jobs numbers coming out and when you look at the business confidence surveys and consumer confidence surveys. There's a lot of improving sentiment," said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer for Commonwealth Financial in Waltham, Massachusetts. US non farm payrolls had the largest increase in four months in January. "Even as the companies are talking their expectations down, consumers and businesses are likely to act on that better sentiment." The US dollar index on January 31 posted its worst start to a year in three decades, putting in a decline of 2.6 per cent for January after gaining 7.1 per cent in the last quarter of 2016. Comments this week by President Donald Trump and a top economics adviser suggested to some that the administration is prepared to jettison two decades of "strong dollar" policies advocated by predecessors. A strong dollar is a worry for equity investors because it makes US multinationals' foreign currency earnings worth less in dollars. Nearly half of S&P 500 sales come from overseas, according to S&P-Dow Jones Indices. Executives from a slew of US companies cited the strong US dollar as a negative in their fourth-quarter reports and also concern about its effect on 2017 results. Among them, Apple gave a cautious outlook for the current quarter that it mainly attributed to the strong dollar, despite its upbeat fourth-quarter results. "For a company like ours, where we do about two-thirds of our business outside the United States, the strong dollar presents a headwind of more than 2 per cent growth," Apple Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri told Reuters. Other companies citing currency hurdles for the last quarter or for 2017 included Procter & Gamble, Mead Johnson Nutrition, 3M Co and PPG Industries. Procter & Gamble said it expects combined headwinds of foreign exchange and minor brand divestitures to cut sales growth by two to three percentage points for fiscal 2017. Some strategists say the dollar is still likely to be stronger rather than weaker this year, especially given expectations for interest rate rises for this year, but that earnings should still benefit from an improving economy. "You should get more than enough growth from the economy if you're a corporation to more than offset the rise in the dollar," said Sameer Samana, global quantitative strategist for Wells Fargo Investment Institute, which expects the US dollar index to rise 7 per cent by year's end.

Published on February 05, 2017. Ambitious doesn't quite fully describe Tide's gameplan for Super Bowl LI. Marketing executives for the Procter & Gamble brand made it clear they would rather not run a big game ad if the creative wasn't worthy of Tide's Super Bowl heritage. This year, live commercials are dominating the pre-game buzz but Tide, in partnership with Saatchi and Saatchi, Traktor and The Mill went a completely different and costly route. Instead of simply advertising in the game, Tide became part of the broadcast, with a little help from Fox Sports announcers Curt Menefee and Terry Bradshaw -- and a bottle of barbeque sauce. In part one of Anatomy of an Ad: The Stain below, we look at the idea behind Tide's big gambit in the big game. The goal: to trick an audience of over 100 million into believing Mr. Bradshaw's stain is happening in real time, that his anxiety is genuine and that Tide is there to clean up the mess. The idea is one thing. The execution is quite another. Just three weeks before the game, P&G and its army of producers, gaffers and grips descended on El Camino Community College in Torrance, Calif. to turn it into a replica of NRG Stadium in Houston, Texas, complete with Fox Sport's Super Bowl broadcast booth and the tunnel leading to the field. They didn't count on the rain. In Episode 2 of Anatomy of an Ad: The Stain, we look at how the Tide team overcame the deluge during filming and put the finishing touches on an unprecedented three-part campaign the brand hopes will make Super Bowl history. Tomorrow, we will post the third installment of Anatomy of An Ad: The Stain. Our videographers Nate Skid and David Hall follow the Tide team during the Super Bowl as it monitors the ad's social impact in real time.

A bevy of free-spending marketers put down big bucks Sunday night to emphasize something they think already makes America great: unity and diversity. After more than a year of divisive rhetoric from a tumultuous presidential campaign, the Super Bowl commercials – valued at more than $5 million for 30 seconds of time – played up multicultural consumers, acceptance of different backgrounds and recognition of the world as a collection of people with different philosophies and values who need to learn to get along. “It’s kind of a very unusual place to be in, when giant global corporations are becoming the moral compass for our society,” said Ari Halper, the chief creative officer at the New York office of FCB, a big ad agency owned by Interpublic Group, in an interview. “If you look back through history, whether it was during Vietnam and Nixon or after the dot-com bubble burst or after the recent housing crisis, advertising responds in kind and plays to the audience and the tenor of our times.” The ads accompanied an amazing game, and helped fuel an historic march by the New England Patriots. Led by quarterback Tom Brady, the team overcame a 25-point deficit and triumphed over the Atlanta Falcons 34 to 28 – after entering the first overtime session in the history of the Super Bowl. Google kicked off the ad stream with a commercial for Google Home that contained a rainbow flag, and had one character ask “How do you say ‘Nice to meet you’ in Spanish?” Airbnb showed the faces of  people from a range of backgrounds and told viewers, “We all belong. The world is more beautiful the more you accept.” Sponsors big and small took up the themes. Freshman Super Bowl sponsor 84 Lumber ran an ad that showed a Spanish-speaking mother and daughter on a harrowing journey, then directed viewers to a web video that depicted them stepping through a door in a giant wall while the girl holds a handmade American flag. Anheuser-Busch InBev, one of the event’s most durable supporters, ran a minute-long commercial in which an immigrant is first told “You don’t look like you’re from around here,” but then is revealed to be Adolphus Busch, one of the co-founders of the company that brews Budweiser, Bud Light and more. “The big through-line is diversity. It’s palpable,” said Rob Schwartz, chief executive of TBWA\Chiat\Day New York, in an interview. Others also played up noble ideas. Honda ran a clever ad showing yearbook photos of celebrities ranging from Magic Johnson to Stan Lee to Tina Fey. PepsiCo ran an ad for its new Lifewtr told viewers that “Art makes life #moreinspired.” Audi ran a spot talking about its commitment to gender pay equity. Coca-Cola sparked the theme with an ad that ran in the pre-game – a repeat of a 2014 Super Bowl commercial featuring children singing “America the Beautiful” in different languages, as well as what is believed to be the first appearance of a same-sex couple in the gridiron championship. Even the National Football League tackled the topic. “We may have our differences, but recognize there’s more that unites us,” read one line in a commercial for the sports league that ran in the second half. Indeed, advertisers have sounded this note many times. General Mills’ Cheerios has run ads about an interracial family, and Procter & Gamble’s Swiffer was once featured in a commercial featuring the same, with a Caucasian father who has lost part of his arm to cancer. Related Is Madison Avenue Leaving America Behind? The appearance of the ads in the Super Bowl serve only to emphasize that American corporations see revenue streams in consumers hailing from many different backgrounds. They are also conscious of the rise of millennial consumers who hold fewer prejudices when it comes to ethnicity and sexual orientation. In the current climate, however, the ads may have more resonance. President Trump’s comments about Latinos, African-Americans and women generated controversy during the 2016 election and his administration’s efforts to set a travel ban on seven countries with dominant Muslim populations has done the same. “We are at a time in which there is a lot of sociopolitical angst going on,” said Matthew Quint, director for the Center of Global Brand Leadership at Columbia Business School. “If you are an organization that fits into that discussion, it’s going to draw more attention this year – more so than in years past.” Not all of the high-minded ads won favor. FCB’s Halper felt the Audi spot was “a little more pandering than some of the other stuff,” and failed to connect the importance of gender pay equity to Audi’s cars. This particular Super Bowl was one of the quirkiest for advertisers, because it included an extra ad break in the overtime session. Hulu, the streaming-video service which is part-owned by 21st Century Fox, Proactive and Sprint aired spots in front of an audience in what was probably the game’s most engaging moment. Of course, some of the advertisers held true to more typical ideas, like celebrities and humor. Procter & Gamble turned the heads of ad-agency executives with ads for Febreze that contained an ode to a halftime bathroom break, and a clever spot for Tide that made viewers believe for a few seconds that they were watching Terry Bradshaw on the Fox Sports Super Bowl broadcast set.  Honda’s use of celebrities also proved winning, said Schwartz, the ad executive. One freshman sponsor, It’s A 1o Haircare, ran a spot that made fun of President Trump’s hair. A different ad from Anheuser revived the ghost of popular beer mascot Spuds McKenzie. Other spots hit a sour note. Sprint ran a commercial showing a father pretending to kill himself in order to cancel his Verizon calling plan. An ad from T-Mobile showed a couple of Verizon customers engaging in bondage, evidence they liked being punished. But the commercials failed to make a connection with elements that would get people to buy Sprint or T-Mobile. Mars’ Snickers took a big swing by airing a live commercial in the third quarter, but its marketing point and storyline – actor Adam Driver read the score to the game, prompting the Western-themed set to fall apart – were unclear. A much-anticipated ad featuring the first appearance of venerable ad mascot Mr. Clean also raised eyebrows. In the commercial, Mr. Clean is seen as a virile Lothario, and swings his animated hips in a come-hither way while cleaning. “It had the opposite effect for me,” said Halper, the FCB agency executive. “It made me feel dirty. ”       Filed Under: Fox Broadcasting Google Procter & Gamble Snjickers Super Bowl Commercials Tv Advertising Want to read more articles like this one?

Contessa46 says: February 5, 2017 at 8:20 pm Industry and advertising know that our differences unite us. Where were they pre election before our fascist president was elected. Where was their voice them? The advertisers and their companies have done more to bring this nation together than our current president. Sad state of affairs. Reply KZ says: February 5, 2017 at 8:08 pm As a woman who earns at the top 2%, I disagree with your comment on Audi. That was the only commercial that makes me want to cry and spark my interest on Audi. I kept thinking about that commercial afterward and how it related with the way I grew up, the path I took to make my success. You need to be a woman to understand it, asking a men for the opinion is so Trump like.

Quotes in the article SPX Corp SPXC ▲ 24.73 +0.15 +0.61% Thomson Reuters Corp TRI ▲ 44.26 +1.02 +2.36% Apple Inc AAPL ▼ 132.12 -0.30 -0.23% First Commonwealth Financial Corp FCF ▲ 13.66 +0.04 +0.29% AdChoices The greenback, whose strong rally after the Nov. 8 U.S. election hit profits at many U.S. multinationals in the fourth quarter, has had a sharp reversal since the start of the year. Coupled with comments suggesting that the Trump administration favors a weaker currency, that could shift the picture for the current quarter. Fourth-quarter results, even with the dollar's drag, are mostly beating Wall Street's expectations and helping provide a buffer to some of the uncertainties facing investors, including the new U.S. president's policies. The S&P 500 (.SPX) ended with a slight gain for the week. With earnings in from more than half the S&P 500 companies, year-over-year profit growth for the fourth quarter is now estimated at 8.0 percent, up from 6.1 percent forecast at the start of January, and on track to be the strongest since the third quarter of 2014, according to Thomson Reuters data. Analysts expect first-quarter earnings to rise 11.5 percent. That "sets the stage for a stronger Q1, particularly when you look at the jobs numbers coming out and when you look at the business confidence surveys and consumer confidence surveys. There's a lot of improving sentiment," said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer for Commonwealth Financial in Waltham, Massachusetts. U.S. nonfarm payrolls had the largest increase in four months in January. "Even as the companies are talking their expectations down, consumers and businesses are likely to act on that better sentiment." The dollar index (.DXY) on Jan. 31 posted its worst start to a year in three decades, putting in a decline of 2.6 percent for January after gaining 7.1 percent in the last quarter of 2016. Comments this week by President Donald Trump and a top economics adviser suggested to some that the administration is prepared to jettison two decades of "strong dollar" policies advocated by predecessors. A strong dollar is a worry for equity investors because it makes U.S. multinationals' foreign currency earnings worth less in dollars. Nearly half of S&P 500 sales come from overseas, according to S&P-Dow Jones Indices. Executives from a slew of U.S. companies cited the strong dollar as a negative in their fourth-quarter reports and also concern about its effect on 2017 results. Among them, Apple (AAPL.O) gave a cautious outlook for the current quarter that it mainly attributed to the strong dollar, despite its upbeat fourth-quarter results. "For a company like ours where we do about two-thirds of our business outside the United States, the strong dollar presents a headwind of more than 2 percent growth," Apple Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri told Reuters. Other companies citing currency hurdles for the last quarter or for 2017 included Procter & Gamble (PG.N), Mead Johnson Nutrition (MJN.N), 3M Co (MMM.N) and PPG Industries (PPG.N). Procter & Gamble said it expects combined headwinds of foreign exchange and minor brand divestitures to cut sales growth by two to three percentage points for fiscal 2017. Some strategists say the dollar is still likely to be stronger rather than weaker this year, especially given expectations for interest rate hikes for this year, but that earnings should still benefit from an improving economy. "You should get more than enough growth from the economy if you're a corporation to more than offset the rise in the dollar," said Sameer Samana, global quantitative strategist for Wells Fargo Investment Institute, which expects the dollar index to rise 7 percent by year end.

My Portfolio   HOME > Investment Ideas > In The News Which Super Bowl LI Commercials Were Social Hits? Posted:02/07/17 By:Benzinga Comments(0) | Add a comment Research  these Stocks on Kapitall’s Playground Now   research now by: Jayson Derrick, Benzinga Staff Writer   Investors who were glued to their TV sets to watch Tom Brady's epic comeback in the 2017 Super Bowl are now shifting their attention and asking the more pertinent question: Which companies outperformed during commercial breaks? The TD Ameritrade Ad Challenge used Social Sentiment data, a resource available to TD Ameritrade clients, to analyze social media sentiment and volume to determine which publicly traded companies are getting the most positive buzz about their ads. Social Sentiment captures every social media mention. It's powered by LikeFolio, which aggregates conversations within a user's' social networks and tracks status updates. It also allows users to filter mentions related to any given division of the company. "You see a lot of buzz after the Super Bowl where people are talking about the commercials in general, but there's never really that much [talk] about publicly traded companies that are advertising and how effective was their ad?" said Nicole Sherrod, TDA's managing director of trading.   Results Are In Taking top ranks in the Ad Challenge is The Coca-Cola Co KO. The company received 8,356 positive tweets for its three commercials, which were titled "It's Beautiful," "Love Story" and "#WannaSprite." "I think the story is that 'polarizing and political' won the night," LikeFolio's co-founder Andy Swan explained to Benzinga in an e-mail. "Coke's America the Beautiful ad was a rerun of an ad that got backlash three years ago, but it generated waves of positive tweets throughout the night." Swan also pointed out that Coca-Cola beat out its rival PepsiCo, Inc. PEP, which was ranked eighth — even though it was a sponsor of the halftime show. Swan also added that Volkswagen AG (ADR) VLKAY's Audi unit took the second spot for its commercial focused on the hotly debated topic of gender equality and fair pay. "People just KEPT talking about it…which allowed it to get more mind share than the Buick ad that literally everyone liked," Swan added.   Full Rankings The final rankings for the public companies in the 2017 TD Ameritrade Ad Challenge are as follows: Coca-Cola: 8,356 positive tweets. Volkswagen: 5,629 positive tweets. Procter & Gamble Co PG: 5,568 positive tweets. General Motors Company GM: 5,449 positive tweets. Anheuser Busch Inbev NV (ADR) BUD: 4,938 positive tweets. T-Mobile US Inc TMUS: 4,675 positive tweets. Honda Motor Co Ltd (ADR) HMC: 3,824 positive tweets. PepsiCo: 3,282 positive tweets.   Sherrod: 'Polarizing Can Win' Speaking as a guest on Fox Business, Sherrod similarly highlighted Coca-Cola's three-year-old commercial and noted the political climate was much different at the time compared to today. "Americans are liking it because it is embracing multiculturalism, it is about being inclusive so people really like it," she said. "As we talk a little bit more we will find that the ads that drilled into polarizing topics did pretty well and I think if you look what's going on in our country and what's happened over the course of the past six months — polarizing can win." Sherrod also noted that advertisers are trying to target the millennial group by sharing core values of wanting to create a better world for the current and future generation. Sherrod also commented on Procter & Gamble's commercial, noting that the advertising team at the company has done a great job as more people walking down the cleaning aisle in stores will now be thinking of the "Mr. Clean" character. In addition, the consumer goods staple is one of the most highly held stocks among TD Ameritrade's clients at around 1.5 billion shares. Bottom line, Sherrod suggested that companies who won the commercial battles could see a boost to their stock on Monday but more important is to see if the millions of dollars spent on the commercials will generate a reasonable rate of return moving forward.   © 2017 Benzinga.com.

"It's the same 20-year-old demographic (as physical sport)," he explained, "(but a) different psychographic." He described a group spending "hours and hours a day" around gaming and eSports. "As a media company, we want to be around that and take advantage of that." How they do that is to typically live broadcast 90% of a competition through partners Twitch and YouTube – "we did a million concurrent streams globally" on Twitch of one recent major game, Ladetsky noted – before moving to television for the final two or three hours of the "grand finale". The digital audience, he added, can continue to view via TV Everywhere or what he called "an observer feed" through Twitch and YouTube. "We don't want to alienate that fanbase," he said, "but we do want to reach new fans, casual fans, on television". And the approach of a digital footprint leading to a television culmination seems to be working. "We see this massive audience of young males we weren't reaching and now we're reaching them," he said. "We're pretty excited about that." Brands are also starting to notice. "Due to our relationships in the sports world, a lot of non-endemic sponsors have come on board," Ladestky said. An example is Old Spice, the Procter & Gamble owned male grooming product, whose Nature Adventure – a gaming-led campaign in the US and Canada on Twitch – has just won a Gold in the Effective use of tech category in the Warc Media Awards.

Register Advertise Follow Subscribe to MediaDailyNews Super Ad Bowl LI: Tweets, Fails And Getting Real by Joe Mandese @mp_joemandese, February 6, 2017 Super Bowl LI was the most “real-time” yet, both on and off the field, as well as on and off TV. The game, the first ever to have such a come-from-behind victory and the first to go into overtime, featured some amazing -- and not-so-amazing -- live performances, as well as some sudden deaths. Perhaps the biggest was Snicker’s heavily promoted “first ever, live” Super Bowl commercial, which after weeks of promotion -- including a flight of tune-in ads for an ad -- came across as “Whaaa?” Reactions were mixed on Twitter, with some followers arguing that the catastrophic spot, which ended awkwardly and abruptly, was kind of the point. Others were not so generous. “Oh @Snickers, what happened? Sorry to say a misfire, didn't seem live except for score mention,” MediaVillage.com’s Stuart Elliott tweeted in a real-time response. advertisement advertisement A string of equally confounded comments, animated GIFs and emojis followed, including one from candy marketer rival Skittles, a Wrigley brand, which tweeted some backhanded support to Mars Inc.’s Snicker’s effort: @SNICKERS it’s okay, you still had a good try! I’ll throw some Skittles at your window for you! #TasteTheRainbow" On the plus side, Snickers did generate plenty of attention and free media impressions -- not just from social media, but from all media. Its “risky” live Super Bowl play was the subject of Monday morning network news shows. It led the Super Bowl commercial review segment on ABC’s “Good Morning America,” which concluded that it left “everybody scratching their head.” Maybe that was actually the point, because even Snickers leaned into the real-time fail, tweeting its own self-effacing: “Never shoot a live Super Bowl commercial when you're hungry. #SB51 #SNICKERSLive, including a post-game replay of the spot that ended with a screen saying: “You ruin a live Super Bowl commercial when you’re hungry.” Almost all the brands in the Big Game leveraged Twitter integrations in some form, sometimes inviting and sparking counter-tweets and/or retweets from followers and rivals alike. According to an analysis released by Twitter last night of the most tweeted ads during the game, Snickers was an honorable mention, while rival Skitters ranked seventh among the 10 most mentioned spots. Pepsi dominated at No. 1, no doubt because it also was the title sponsor of Lady Gaga’s spectacular half-time show, which ended with her making a real-time reception before diving off the stage. Perhaps the best live Twitter integration was construction supplier 84 Lumber’s, which drove users to its Web site to see the conclusion of a 30-second spot it aired during the game. Fox rejected the company’s original version, which featured a giant wall along the U.S./Mexican border, so 84 Lumber used its on-air spot to run a emotional vignette of a Mexican mom and her young daughter emigrating north. The online version, which initially crashed 84lumber.com’s servers, was also viewable on YouTube and showed the mother and daughter confronted by a giant wall, until they noticed two giant wooden doors granting them access. It was fantastical allusion to one of the other big subtexts of Super Ad Bowl LI that touched on American immigration and inclusion themes (see Bob Garfield's column), including an Airbnb’s #weaccept spot, which was followed by an email marketing initiative to members this morning, asking them to provide temporary housing to 100,000 people in “dire need.” Most spots, however, went for the obligatory laugh, including a wonderful two-parter from Procter & Gamble’s Tide that evoked a real-time Twitter sensibility as it followed Fox Sports announcer “trending” in real-time after he stained his shirt during the live telecast, rushed off-field and out of the stadium, only to end up at actor Jeffrey Tambor’s home, where he waited as Tambor washed his shirt with Tide. Part II of the commercial ends with Bradshaw back in the announcer’s booth, when co-commentator Curt Menefee’s spills coffee on his shirt. Cut to Tambor sitting at home watching the game. According to Twitter’s analysis Super Bowl fans around the world sent more than 27.6 million Tweets about #SB51 during the live telecast on @NFLonFOX according to Twitter.

Submit news M&Ms, John Lewis, Brooke Bond Red Label, US Army win Golds at Warc Media Awards 6 Feb 2017 | Save | Email | Print |  PDF     Warc has announced the Gold, Silver and Bronze winners of the global Warc Media Awards: Effective Use of Partnerships & Sponsorships category. The Gold winners are Mars-owned confectionary brand M&Ms, retailer John Lewis, tea brand Brooke Bond Red Label and the US Army. Ron Amram, jury chair The international 10-member jury, chaired by Ron Amram, VP Media of Heineken USA, have awarded four Golds, two Silvers and one Bronze, honouring how collaborations with third parties, including native advertising and sponsorships, have helped brands meet business goals. Golds demonstrate innovation, results Mars-owned confectionery brand M&Ms celebrated its 75th anniversary by using digital partnerships to reinvent its iconic Candyman song, which helped it to engage millennials and reverse a sales decline. The campaign was through BBDO New York and MediaCom. Anna Watkins, partner, Mofilm and Warc Media Awards judge, commented, “The results were stellar. Even though many of the other sponsorships were beautifully executed, this also delivered innovation and results.” Manning Gottlieb OMD’s partnership between Age UK and John Lewis that highlighted the social problem of older people being alone at Christmas was another gold winner. “This partnership was a genuine and authentic way to make people think about an issue that’s not easy to talk about,” said judge Kerry Hemmerich, EVP, group client director, Spark SMG. Hindustan Unilever-owned India Brooke Bond Red Label (BBRL) Tea used the power of popular culture and a partnership with Y-Films to highlight the social issue of discrimination against India’s transgender community. The ‘6 Pack Brand’ initiative impressed judges, winning it a gold in this category as well as in the Best Use of Data category. Brandon Keenen, Brand Partnerships, Europe, Buzzfeed, said, “This musical collaboration was risky in a conservative country, but it was a great use of local content and was really impactful, achieving more for the transgender community than for the brand itself.” Also winning gold was The US army, through its partnership with the movie Independence Day: Resurgence. Through MRM//McCann, this campaign helped the army to increase its recruitment rate and change perceptions. Consultant Brian Goldstein, who was on the judging panel, said, “They identified a unique way in and made people stop and look at them.” Gaming campaigns win Silvers Two gaming led campaigns won silvers: Under Armour’s Game Changer campaign, through Optimum Sports and Droga5, where the sportswear brand powered up the Under Armour-sponsored basketball player Stephen Curry in the NBA 2K video game series. Nissan Controller, through OMD Finland and TBWA Helsinki, saw the car brand grow test drive requests, through an innovative partnership with PlayStation, entertainment company Konami and UEFA Champions League. Bronze wins for fragrance P&G Prestige won a bronze for Smell My Neck, a campaign through Starcom US which used online video to show off the power of smell and increase sales in the fragrance category. The winners of the Effective Use of Tech, the last category to be announced, will be revealed soon. The Grand Prix and Special Awards winners across all categories will be unveiled at an event in London on 9 February 2017. ‹    Like Save Email Print PDF Comment on thisComment Comment guidelines and disclaimer LEGAL DISCLAIMER: This Message Board accepts no liability of legal consequences that arise from the Message Boards (e.g. defamation, slander, or other such crimes).
