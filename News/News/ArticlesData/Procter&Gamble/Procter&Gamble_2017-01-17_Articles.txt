Posts Earnings The trends investors will be focused on in next week's quarterly report. Demitrios Kalogeropoulos (TMFSigma) Jan 18, 2017 at 2:42PM Image source: P&G. Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) has been promising a growth rebound for two years, but this week investors could finally see evidence of that recovery taking hold. The consumer goods giant is expected to announce just a small uptick in profit amid flat revenue when it posts fiscal second-quarter earnings results on Jan 25. However, its operating picture should be brighter than what those headline results suggest. Market share The company is already growing at a faster pace. Last quarter, organic revenue rose by 3% to mark P&G's best result on that metric since early 2014. Image source: P&G investor presentation. Looking deeper into the numbers, a few trends suggest Procter & Gamble could be in the early innings of a sustainable improvement here. First, momentum is on its side. Organic growth was flat three quarters ago before rising to a 2% pace and then to a 3% rate in the fiscal first quarter. Next, P&G has closed the gap with rivals. The 2% pace it is on track to hit in fiscal 2017 is the same as Kimberly-Clark (NYSE:KMB), which trounced the company by two full percentage points in each of the prior two fiscal years. Finally, P&G's latest growth has come from volume gains, rather than price hikes, meaning the company could finally be ending its two-year market share slide. Investors should temper their enthusiasm, though, since the global market is currently bumping along at near-zero growth. Peer Unilever (NYSE:UL) warned in late October that demand gains weakened to flat in some of its biggest markets. And Kimberly-Clark sounded the same tone in its third-quarter press release, with management complaining of a "challenging economic and competitive environment" that sent volume expansion to 0% from 3% in the prior quarter. P&G will post its results within days of both Unilever and Kimberly-Clark, and if it continues to close the growth gap, then investors will know management is on the right track. Profits CEO David Taylor and his executive team expect earnings to rise by about 6% this year, not including the temporary effects of foreign currency swings and brand divestments. That would be the first time in three years that P&G has hit its long-term target of profit growth in the mid-single digits after core earnings fell by 2% in both fiscal 2016 and 2015. There's reason for optimism about a further rebound in the cards. After all, P&G's profit target was put together when the company was much larger, and much harder to manage. Now that it has shed 100 of its slowest-growing, least-profitable franchises, though, the profit picture should improve. Executives believe that the new portfolio of brands, led by blockbusters like Pampers and Gillette, should grow at a 1% faster organic sales pace and enjoy a full percentage point of higher profitability. While investors wait for those improvements to accrue to the bottom line, P&G's cost-cutting program should deliver more immediate benefits over the next few quarters. Growth outlook There are major headwinds that will make it difficult for Procter & Gamble to wow investors this week, including a soft demand environment for branded consumer products. Yet if there's any time for the company to break away from rivals and leave its own slow-growth history behind, this would be it. P&G just completed the biggest transformation in its corporate history and finally has the collection of brands that it wants -- all at a much lower cost burden. That improved positioning might at least get the company back on track to more normal sales and profit gains in fiscal 2017, while also raising expectations for accelerated growth ahead.

FUER DEN INHALT IST ALLEIN DAS BERICHTENDE UNTERNEHMEN VERANTWORTLICH. In partnerschaftlicher Zusammenarbeit mit der UNESCO und Save the Children wollen P&G und Always, die P&G-Marke für Monatshygiene, von der Syrienkrise betroffenen jungen Frauen behilflich sein, ihr Selbstvertrauen durch Ausbildung und Kompetenzentwicklung wiederzugewinnen. DAVOS, Schweiz --(BUSINESS WIRE)--18.01.2017-- Procter & Gamble und die global führende Monatshygienemarke 'Always' meldeten heute ein neues Engagement, um Mädchen und jungen Frauen behilflich zu sein, die durch die syrische Flüchtlingskrise aufgeworfenen Herausforderungen zu meistern. In partnerschaftlicher Zusammenarbeit mit der UNESCO und Save the Children wollen sie jungen Frauen in Jordanien behilflich sein, durch Ausbildung und Kompetenzentwicklung ihr Selbstvertrauen wiederzugewinnen. Mit dem heutigen Engagement fördert Always seine Markenmission, das Selbstvertrauen von Mädchen zu stärken und die geschlechtsbezogene Diskriminierung in der Welt abzubauen.

L-R: Lliam Findlay - Policy and Advocacy Adviser to the CEO, Save the Children; Tanya Beckett - Presenter, BBC News; Gülsar Corat - Director of the Division for Gender Equality, UNESCO; Carolyn Tastad - Gender Equality Executive Sponsor, P&G; Maurice Levy - CEO, Publicis Groupe (Photo: Business Wire) Der Start des neuen Engagements wurde im Rahmen einer Podiumsdiskussion auf dem Weltwirtschaftsforum in Davos bekanntgegeben. Hier erörterten internationale Fachleute und Führungskräfte von P&G und Always gemeinsam Lösungen, mit denen die Zukunft von jungen Frauen durch Ausbildung und Kompetenzentwicklung im Kontext der aktuellen Flüchtlingskrise gesichert werden kann. Zu den Teilnehmern gehörten Carolyn Tastad, Gender Equality Executive Sponsor und Group President of North America bei P&G, Gülser Corat, Direktor der Abteilung für Geschlechtergleichstellung der UNESCO, Lliam Findlay, Policy and Advocacy Adviser des CEO, Save the Children, und Maurice Levy, CEO der Publicis Groupe. Eine große Zahl syrischer Flüchtlinge, insbesondere Mädchen, gehen nicht mehr zur Schule. Bei Mädchen, die in die Pubertät kommen, und im frühen Teenager-Alter ist das Risiko besonders hoch. Ihr Körper ändert sich und die bisher erhaltene familiäre Unterstützung ist womöglich nicht länger verfügbar. Dies führt zu einem geschwächten Selbstvertrauen und zum Fernbleiben von der Schule oder Bildungsstelle. Außerdem sind viele junge Frauen im Rahmen der Flüchtlingskrise nicht in der Lage, zu arbeiten und zum Einkommen ihrer Familien beizutragen, da sie keine Möglichkeit finden, in die Schule zu gehen. Auch geschlechtsbezogene Barrieren führen dazu, dass sie zuhause bleiben. P&G und Always setzen sich dafür ein, diesen Missstand zu ändern. Sie sind davon überzeugt, dass Ausbildung Mädchen und junge Frauen auf einzigartige Weise dazu befähigen kann, selbstbewusst, kompetent und stark zu sein und damit in der Lage, ihre Zukunft auch unter schwierigsten Umständen selbst in die Hand zu nehmen. Es ist eine gut dokumentierte Tatsache, dass Familien gesünder und Gemeinschaften stärker sind, wenn es den Mädchen und Frauen gut geht. Das neue Engagement in Jordanien baut auf die 30-jährige Arbeit von Always auf, mit der jedes Jahr mehr als 17 Millionen Mädchen Informationen über die Pubertät und Selbstvertrauensfragen erhalten. Es erweitert außerdem den aktiven Fokus von P&G auf die Gleichstellung der Geschlechter. Damit wird unsere bestehende Partnerschaft mit der UNESCO erweitert, die in Senegal und Nigeria dringend benötigte Unterstützung bereitstellt, damit die Mädchen dort länger zur Schule gehen können. Die neue Initiative mit der UNESCO konzentriert sich auf junge Frauen aus Syrien und Jordanien, die bei der Fortsetzung und beim Abschluss ihrer Grundschulbildung bzw. einer Berufsausbildung auf erhebliche Hindernisse stoßen. Das Programm bietet diesen gefährdeten jungen Frauen Lebenskompetenzen und Vorbereitung auf das Arbeitsleben. Gleichzeitig werden Lebenserfahrungen geteilt und ein Dialog zwischen Menschen aus Syrien und Jordanien wird in Gang gesetzt. Junge Frauen sollen damit die Chance erhalten, Geschäfts- und Berufskompetenzen zu erwerben, um ihr Potenzial entfalten zu können. Always unterstützt zudem auch ein zweites Programm mit Save the Children, das unsere Kollektivarbeit ausweitet mit Fokus auf die Unterstützung Tausender Mädchen aus dem südlichen Afrika und Nigeria, ihre Schulbildung zu verlängern. Das Programm verschafft ans Haus gebundenen Mädchen Lebenskompetenzen und erläutert ihren Eltern, wie wichtig es ist, ihre Töchter im Verlauf der Pubertät zu unterstützen. Des Weiteren umfasst das Programm auch die Unterstützung lokaler Gemeinschaften durch formelle und informelle Ausbildung und Aufklärung in lokalen Schulen oder im häuslichen Umfeld. Der Abbau sozialer und familiärer Barrieren ist wichtig, wenn Mädchen das notwendige Selbstvertrauen fürs Leben vermittelt werden soll. Darum beinhalten diese Bestrebungen auch die Ausbildung und Aufklärung von Eltern und Gemeinschaften zu Themen wie das Recht von Mädchen auf Bildung, die Rolle von Frauen in der Gesellschaft und die Bedeutung der Gleichstellung der Geschlechter. Mit diesen Programmen sollen rund 1.000 Mädchen und junge Frauen erreicht werden. Carolyn Tastad, Gender Equality Executive Sponsor und Group President of North America, P&G, fügte hinzu: 'Bei P&G sind wir der Auffassung, dass Frauen und Mädchen eine Kraft darstellen, die die Welt zum Besseren wandeln kann. Je mehr sie wissen und können, desto mehr steigt ihr Selbstvertrauen, mit dem sie ihr volles Potenzial entfalten können. Mit unserem heute angekündigten Engagement als P&G und über unsere Marke 'Always' wollen wir dazu beitragen, eine bessere Welt für uns alle zu schaffen - eine Welt, in der keine geschlechtsbezogenen Benachteiligungen bestehen.' Wenn Sie dieses Programm unterstützen möchten, dann können Sie einen Spendenbeitrag zur UNESCO und Save the Children leisten, damit diese Organisationen noch mehr Mädchen und Frauen mit lebensverändernder Unterstützung erreichen können.

FUER DEN INHALT IST ALLEIN DAS BERICHTENDE UNTERNEHMEN VERANTWORTLICH. In partnership with UNESCO and Save the Children, P&G and its Always feminine care brand help rebuild the confidence of girls impacted by the Syrian crisis through education and skill development. DAVOS, Switzerland --(BUSINESS WIRE)-- 17.01.2017 -- Today, Procter & Gamble and global feminine care leader, Always, announce a new commitment to address the challenges girls and young women are facing due to the effects of the Syrian refugee crisis. In partnership with UNESCO and Save the Children, they will help rebuild the confidence of girls in Jordan through education and skill development. Today’s commitment furthers the Always brand’s mission of championing girls’ confidence and a world free from gender bias. This Smart News Release features multimedia. View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170117006529/en/ Marking the launch of this new commitment during a panel at the World Economic Forum in Davos, P&G and Always brought together international experts and leading figures to discuss solutions to securing the future of young women through education and skill development within the context of the current refugee crisis. Participants included Carolyn Tastad, Gender Equality Executive Sponsor and Group President of North America, P&G, Gülser Corat, Director of the Division for Gender Equality, UNESCO, Lliam Findlay, Policy and Advocacy Adviser to the CEO, Save the Children and Maurice Levy, CEO, Publicis Groupe. A large number of Syrian refugees, especially girls, are no longer attending school. Adolescent girls entering puberty or going through their early teenage years are particularly at risk. Their bodies are changing and the support they might usually receive from their families may no longer be available, resulting in a loss of confidence and them being left out of school and education. Additionally, many young women affected by the refugee crisis are unable to work and provide income for their families, lacking access to training and facing gender-based barriers that keep them at home. P&G and Always are working to stop this, rooted in the belief that education is key to empowering girls and young women so they are confident, skilled, strong and equipped to take charge of their future even in the most challenging circumstances. It’s well-documented that when girls and women thrive, families are healthier and communities are stronger. This new commitment in Jordan builds on the Always’ 30-year heritage of providing puberty and confidence education to more than 17 million girls around the world every year, and furthers P&G’s focus on and commitment to gender equality. It extends our existing partnership with UNESCO which has provided much-needed support to girls in Senegal and Nigeria to help them stay in school. This new initiative with UNESCO focuses on reaching young Syrian and Jordanian women, who have encountered significant challenges with continuing and completing basic education or pursuing training opportunities. The programme provides these young, at-risk women with life-skills and work readiness training, whilst encouraging shared experiences and an open dialogue between Syrians and Jordanians. It is designed to help the young women develop business and vocational skills to realise their potential. Always are also supporting a second programme with Save the Children; which expands our collective work, focused on helping thousands of adolescent South African and Nigerian girls stay in school. This programme provides homebound girls with life skills and educates their parents on the importance of supporting their daughters through puberty. The programme also involves local community support through formal and non-formal education, either in local schools or home-school efforts. Removing social and family barriers is important to ensuring girls have the confidence to grow and thrive. That’s why these efforts include training and education of parents and community members on topics including girls’ right to education, the role of women in society, and the importance of gender equality. The programmes aim to reach around 1000 girls and young women. Carolyn Tastad, Gender Equality Executive Sponsor and Group President of North America, P&G adds: “At P&G, we believe girls and women are a force for positive change in the world. Growing their knowledge and skills builds confidence and unleashes their full potential and power. Our commitment today as P&G and through our Always brand contributes to our aspiration to build a better world for all of us — a world free of gender bias." Those who want to support this commitment can donate to UNESCO and Save the Children funds, which will allow them to reach more girls and women with life-changing support.

The initiative will see P&G invest Sh50 million, with World Vision as the implementation partner. It is part of P&G’s Children’s Safe Drinking Water (CSDW) programme that has been running in Kenya for over 10 years. The programme utilises P&G Purifier of Water sachets, which use low-cost powdered technology, designed to purify even heavily contaminated drinking water to meet World Health Organisation standards for safe drinking water. The P&G Purifier of Water was invented by the firm’s scientists in collaboration with the US Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, with each four-gramme packet of P&G water purifier turning 10 litres of dirty, potentially deadly water into clean and drinkable water in minutes. “If everyone everywhere had clean water, the number of diarrheal deaths would be cut by 34 per cent,” said P&G Kenya Managing Director Vivek Sunder in a statement.

For more than two years, P&G executives have transformed the company into a simpler and hopefully easier-to-grow maker of consumer staples. But before P&G gives investors a look at a company with 100 fewer brands, several investing pros caution it will still struggle with old – and some new – problems. Since December, half a dozen analysts have either cut their target price, downgraded the stock or both. "Cosmetics, household and personal care stocks are no longer en vogue," wrote Barclays analyst Lauren Lieberman in a report published Monday, who cut her target price for P&G shares to $77 from $86. P&G shares closed Wednesday at $84.93, up 39 cents or 0.46%. Here's why some analysts aren't big P&G boosters: •Flatlining sales. P&G has sold Wall Street on the theory that a smaller company is a better one. In August 2014, executives said P&G would sell off dozens of small brands and focus on growing its 65 largest ones. But after two years of deal-making, the company has outlined modest growth for the current fiscal year, ending June 30. P&G expects "organic sales" –  those that exclude the impact of foreign exchange, mergers or acquisitions – to increase a modest 2% this fiscal year. Results for this closely-watched metric got off to a strong start by climbing 3% during the July-to-September quarter. Organic sales rose an anemic 1% in the last two fiscal years. And despite the strength of the U.S. economy in the last few years, nearly two-thirds of P&G sales come from overseas where economic growth is sluggish. Analysts say for P&G's stock to continue to move up, the company needs to post steady sales and profit growth. Goldman Sachs analyst Jason English is not expecting P&G to match its first quarter sales gains in the second quarter. In a report published earlier this month, English downgraded P&G to a "sell" rating from a "hold" and cut his target price to $77 from $86. •Move to riskier stocks. U.S. stocks have rallied 7% since Donald Trump was elected president with investors betting a Republican-led administration will cut regulations and taxes and boost defense and infrastructure spending. P&G's shares have slumped in the same time period by nearly 4%. Why? Billions of dollars are shifting into riskier cyclical industries. P&G is a “safety stock,” a place where investors park their money in uncertain times. P&G was an especially attractive stock because of its 3% dividend yield. But when the investing climate improves, investors often shift their money into faster-growing companies, which creates tremendous downward pressure on stocks like P&G. Consumer staple stocks, which includes P&G, have declined nearly 2%. Meanwhile, financial and telecomm stocks have jumped by double digits since the election. If P&G's earnings remained flat and its stock suddenly reverted to its average valuation over the last decade, it would shave $12 off the stock price. Analysts say there's little room for P&G's stock to move up until sales and profits climb, providing more fuel for the share price. "In a still relatively rich sector, P&G stands out with its absolute P/E (price-to-earnings) still near a decade high," English said. Rising interest rates, furthermore, encourage another class of investor to pull money out of P&G. Nearly zero-percent yields on treasuries and low rates on bonds for more than half a decade have encouraged many investors to put money into stable stocks with solid dividend yields. That maneuver is starting to reverse as rates climb. •Trade tensions snarling overseas business. President-elect Trump won the election, in part, on promises that included getting tougher on foreign countries like China and Mexico. Multinational corporations such as P&G have seen their stocks shaken since the election over a potential trade war erupting. In the past month, Trump has prompted some American manufacturers to pare back plans to move factories to Mexico using threats of heavy tariffs on foreign-produced goods. Analysts and investors are nervous that future disputes or negotiations could lead to foreign governments retaliating with their own tariffs or other harassment of American businesses. P&G gets 59% of its business outside the United States. About 8% of its business, or $5.2 billion in sales, comes from China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau. Eight percent of P&G's sales occur in Latin America. "Continued heightened geopolitical uncertainty limit upside and are likely to result in P&G shares remaining rangebound for the next 6-12 months," wrote Stifel analyst Mark Astrachan in December. Astrachan downgraded P&G from a "buy" to a "hold" rating and cut the target share price from $88 to $86. •Strong dollar strangling results. Even without trade disruptions, there's another potential drag on P&G from its exposure to international markets: currency headwinds. The U.S. dollar continues to strengthen against many foreign currencies. A strong dollar devalues P&G's foreign sales when they are converted back into U.S. currency and that can make the company's products more expensive to overseas consumers. P&G has blamed currency woes with wiping out more $9 billion in sales over the past two years. Pressure from foreign exchange had been lifting this fiscal year. But since the U.S. election, the Mexican peso has dropped 13 percent, the Japanese yen has slipped 10 percent, the euro has slid 4 percent and the British pound has declined 2 percent. SunTrust analyst William Chappell wrote in late December that much of P&G's turnaround efforts – savings from the brand divestitures and job cuts – have been marred by the company's stubborn currency problems. "We believe P&G has received little credit for its $10 billion in cost savings program over the past three years because most of the benefits have been masked by adverse FX (foreign exchange)," Chappell wrote. "Near term strengthening of the dollar would impair fiscal year 2017 results." Chappell lowered his rating on P&G from "buy" to "hold" and cut his price target for the stock to $85 from $95.

Shrinath V. BHIM’s screen shows icons to let users send money, receive money and scan a QR (quick response) code to pay. Photo: Priyanka Parashar/Mint Alan George Lafley, a former chief executive officer of Procter & Gamble Co., once famously said, “Your products run for election every day and good design is critical to winning the campaign.” Good design is born of a deep understanding of the user’s world, and creating a product that helps solve a burning problem. User interface design of the best apps lets onboarding of users easily, allowing regular users to finish key activities with ease. In this context, the recently-launched BHIM (Bharat Interface for Money) app scores over the UPI (Unified Payments Interface) apps launched by various banks. The UPI platform was launched a few months ago to seamlessly transfer money between accounts at 30 leading banks in India. The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) had designed UPI as a common backend platform, with each bank working on its own user interface. Despite the marketing push for UPI post-demonetization, the user interfaces of various apps were too complex for everyday use. These apps tried to help users who had some familiarity with mobile banking, but were difficult for new users to try out. I once helped a taxi driver install the SBI Buddy app on his phone, and realized that the interface and terminology were confusing for first-time mobile banking users. With BHIM, NPCI has designed the product with this segment in mind. The app is currently available on Android, with the iOS version in the pipeline. The interface is simple and learnable, and that is BHIM’s biggest advantage. BHIM keeps user onboarding simple. Users choose a language (currently English or Hindi, with other languages coming soon) and set a 4-digit PIN (personal identification number). The app sends an SMS for verification, and when done, displays a list of bank accounts that are supported. Users can pick an account for which they have enabled mobile banking, and BHIM automatically configures that as the account for receiving money. The system uses the mobile number as the default ID, though users can create an ID of <username>@upi if they wish to. This flow resembles the onboarding of apps like WhatsApp that they’re likely to be familiar with, meaning there’s a lesser chance of drop-offs during set-up. Good design also lets people start and finish key activities quickly. BHIM’s screen shows icons to let users send money, receive money and scan a QR (quick response) code to pay. Users can type in a mobile number and do a look-up within the app to pay someone. If the recipient also has BHIM installed, BHIM pulls up details and allows users to send money in a couple of taps. Alternatively, users can scan a QR code within the app to make payments. Interestingly, BHIM allows generation of QR codes for specific amounts within the app. These can be printed and pasted or displayed. When users scan this code, the account details and transfer amount are both pre-filled, allowing for one-tap payment. This can have interesting applications in retail stores, allowing users to self-checkout items if required. There’s much more that BHIM allows. Users can check bank account balance and see transaction history. To replace cash-on-delivery use cases, BHIM allows users to send a collect request with an expiry date—recipients can authorize payment after receiving their purchased items. Users can change the selected bank account, but this option is hidden under a menu, as the target segment is unlikely to have multiple bank accounts. BHIM does have its points of friction. Users need to enter the UPI PIN for their banking app before BHIM allows sending money from the account. This may be different from the BHIM PIN, potentially confusing users. In my usage, I found that the BHIM app occasionally hangs when starting up, and is often slow or unresponsive. It’s also strange that there is no easy ‘sign out’ option and that hitting the back button on the home screen minimizes it instead of logging the user off. This is a security concern, as most users will not realize that they are still signed in. I hope these issues are sorted out in coming versions. Given that BHIM targets first-time digital payment users, the simplicity of the design is its standout feature. It does what it aims to do, and keeps things simple. For a technology product, that’s a refreshing approach to take. Shrinath V. is a Google Developer Expert (Product Strategy) and a design thinking consultant with Auspin Ventures. Shrinath V.

A P&G e a sua marca Always anunciam compromisso para mudar o mundo das meninas refugiadas Em parceria com a UNESCO e a organização Save the Children, a P&G e a sua marca de produtos para cuidados femininos Always ajudam a devolver a confiança das meninas impactadas pela crise da Síria, através de educação e desenvolvimento de habilidades.

L-R: Lliam Findlay – Policy and Advocacy Adviser to the CEO, Save the Children; Tanya Beckett – Presenter, BBC News; Gülsar Corat – Director of the Division for Gender Equality, UNESCO; Carolyn Tastad – Gender Equality Executive Sponsor, P&G; Maurice Levy – CEO, Publicis Groupe (Photo: Business Wire) Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail Small Preview Thumbnail Small Preview Thumbnail Windows Media Video Quicktime MPEG-4 Video January 17, 2017 08:04 PM Eastern Standard Time DAVOS, Suíça--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Hoje, a Procter & Gamble e a Always, líder mundial em produtos de cuidados femininos, anunciaram um novo compromisso para lidar com os desafios que as meninas e jovens mulheres enfrentam devido aos efeitos da crise de refugiados sírios. Em parceria com a UNESCO e a organização Save the Children, eles pretendem ajudar a devolver a confiança das meninas na Jordânia, através da educação e desenvolvimento de habilidades. O compromisso anunciado hoje reforça a missão da marca Always de lutar para restaurar a confiança das meninas e por um mundo livre de preconceito de gênero. Para marcar o lançamento de novo compromisso durante um painel do Fórum Econômico Mundial em Davos, a P&G e a Always reuniram especialistas internacionais e pessoas de liderança para discutir soluções para garantir o futuro das mulheres jovens através de educação e desenvolvimento de habilidades no contexto da crise atual de refugiados. Os participantes incluíram Carolyn Tastad, patrocinadora executiva de Igualdade dos Gêneros e presidente do grupo da América do Norte, P&G, Gülser Corat, diretor da divisão para Igualdade dos Gêneros, UNESCO, Lliam Findlay, consultora política e jurídica para a diretoria executiva, organização Save the Children, e Maurice Levy, diretor executivo, Publicis Groupe. Um grande número de refugiados sírios, especialmente as meninas, não estão mais indo à escola. As adolescentes entrando na puberdade ou passando por seus anos de adolescência estão particularmente em risco. Seus corpos estão mudando e o apoio que geralmente poderiam receber de suas famílias pode não mais existir, resultando na perda de confiança por terem ficado sem escola e educação. Além disso, muitas mulheres jovens afetadas pela crise de refugiados são incapazes de trabalhar e ajudar a sustentar as suas famílias, porque não têm acesso ao treinamento e enfrentam barreiras em relação ao gênero, o que as mantêm confinadas em casa. A P&G e a Always se uniram para interromper este processo, que tem raízes na crença de que a educação é fundamental para capacitar as meninas e mulheres jovens para que se tornem confiantes, especializadas, fortes e equipadas para assumir o seu futuro, mesmo nas condições mais desafiadoras. Este novo compromisso na Jordânia baseia-se na herança de 30 anos da Always de fornecer educação da puberdade e confiança para mais de 17 milhões de meninas no mundo inteiro a cada ano e reforça ainda mais o foco e o compromisso da P&G com a igualdade dos gêneros. Ele amplia nossa parceria existente com a UNESCO, que tem prestado um apoio muito necessário às meninas do Senegal e Nigéria para que permaneçam na escola. Esta nova iniciativa com a UNESCO se concentra em alcançar a mulheres jovens da Síria e Jordânia, que encontram desafios significativos para continuar e concluir a educação básica ou para buscar oportunidades de treinamento. O programa oferece a estas jovens mulheres em risco habilidades para a vida e treinamento de prontidão para o trabalho, enquanto encoraja experiências compartilhadas em um diálogo aberto entre jovens sírias e jordanianas. Ele foi idealizado para ajudar as mulheres jovens a desenvolver habilidades de negócios e profissionais para concretizar seu potencial. A Always também está apoiando um segundo programa com a organização Save the Children, que expande o nosso trabalho coletivo, com o foco em ajudar milhares de adolescentes sul-africanas e meninas nigerianas a permanecer na escola. Este programa oferece às meninas confinadas à casa habilidades para a vida e educa os seus pais sobre a importância de apoiar as suas filhas durante o período da puberdade. O programa também envolve o apoio das comunidades locais através de educação formal e não formal, seja em escolas locais ou em esforços de educação em casa. Eliminar as barreiras sociais e familiares é importante para garantir que as meninas tenham confiança para crescer e prosperar. É por isso que estes esforços incluem o treinamento e a educação dos pais e membros da comunidade sobre tópicos que incluem o direito à educação para as meninas, o papel da mulher na sociedade e a importância da igualdade dos gêneros. Os programas ajudam a alcançar cerca de 1.000 meninas e mulheres jovens. Carolyn Tastad, patrocinadora executiva de Igualdade dos Gêneros e presidente do grupo da América do Norte na P&G acrescentou: “Na P&G, acreditamos que as meninas e mulheres são uma força para a mudança positiva no mundo. O crescimento de seu conhecimento e habilidades desenvolve a confiança e libera seus pleno potencial e poder. Nosso compromisso hoje, como a P&G e através de nossa marca Always, contribui para a nossa aspiração de criar um mundo melhor para todos nós — um mundo livre do preconceito de gênero".

Demitrios Kalogeropoulos (TMFSigma) Jan 17, 2017 at 4:19PM Consumer goods giant Kimberly-Clark (NYSE:KMB) will announce its fourth-quarter results before the market opens on Tuesday, Jan. 24. The stock underperformed the market and global rival Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) in 2016 as sales growth ground to a halt. But will the owner of the Huggies diapers and Kleenex tissue brands have more bad news for shareholders to kick off the new fiscal year? Below are a few critical trends for investors to watch in the upcoming report. Organic growth Kimberly-Clark's last quarterly outing showed evidence of a sharp growth slowdown as sales volume dove from 4% in the prior quarter to just 0%. Organic sales, the company's single most important metric, fell to 0% from 3%. Image source: Kimberly-Clark. Some of that slump can be tied to the weak sales environment that's keeping the entire industry at near zero growth. However, competitive threats are also taking their toll. Procter & Gamble competes with Kimberly-Clark's Huggies brand, and the consumer products titan saw its volume trends improve over the past quarter, as its Pampers market share lead hit a new high. Thanks to both increased competition and softening demand, Kimberly-Clark dialed back its full-year sales growth outlook to just 2%. That's far from the 3% to 5% gains that CEO Tom Falk and his executive team originally projected, and it's even below the 3% that they were targeting as recently as the second quarter. Hitting that lowered goal won't be enough to hint at a business rebound, though. Within the organic sales growth figures, investors should keep an eye on the balance of volume and pricing contributions. Ideally, Kimberly-Clark will show volume-driven growth while at least keeping its average prices unchanged. If instead volume is flat and the company relies only on price boosts to raise revenue, that's an indication that growth is fragile and not likely to quickly recover its prior 4% pace. Profits and cash Kimberly-Clark's financial wins keep piling up despite the weak sales growth pace, and investors will want to see more progress there. Gross and operating profit margins both improved last quarter, thanks mainly to an expense-cutting initiative that is removing $375 million from annual costs. That's the key reason why even with a lower revenue base, the company managed to generate $836 million of operating profit last quarter, up from $779 million in the prior year. KMB Cash from Operations (TTM) data by YCharts. Kimberly-Clark is also producing plenty of cash, with operating cash jumping 12% to $950 million at the last quarterly checkup. Return on invested capital is on the rise too and running well ahead of management's goal. The company can't do much about a weakening industry or rising competitive threats, but executives do have the power to keep earnings -- and cash returns to shareholders -- rising through continued improvements on the efficiency side of the business. The rebound plan At this time last year, Kimberly-Clark issued what turned out to be an overly optimistic annual growth forecast that executives had to dial back twice during the year. Another quarter of weak volume gains could convince the company to stay conservative for its 2017 outlook, though. If it hits its full-year goal of 2% organic growth, Kimberly-Clark will be entering the new fiscal year at about the same pace as Procter & Gamble, but also at just half the level it enjoyed in fiscal 2015. Shareholders can be sure that a disappointing forecast like that would come with a detailed plan to recover momentum. Any rebound initiatives would likely include stepped-up cost-cutting and efficiency moves but also might venture into more aggressive actions, like the brand-shedding process that P&G just concluded.

In partnership with UNESCO and Save the Children, they will help rebuild the confidence of girls in Jordan through education and skill development. Today’s commitment furthers the Always brand’s mission of championing girls’ confidence and a world free from gender bias. Marking the launch of this new commitment during a panel at the World Economic Forum in Davos, P&G and Always brought together international experts and leading figures to discuss solutions to securing the future of young women through education and skill development within the context of the current refugee crisis. Participants included Carolyn Tastad, Gender Equality Executive Sponsor and Group President of North America, P&G, Gülser Corat, Director of the Division for Gender Equality, UNESCO, Lliam Findlay, Policy and Advocacy Adviser to the CEO, Save the Children and Maurice Levy, CEO, Publicis Groupe. A large number of Syrian refugees, especially girls, are no longer attending school. Adolescent girls entering puberty or going through their early teenage years are particularly at risk. Their bodies are changing and the support they might usually receive from their families may no longer be available, resulting in a loss of confidence and them being left out of school and education. Additionally, many young women affected by the refugee crisis are unable to work and provide income for their families, lacking access to training and facing gender-based barriers that keep them at home. P&G and Always are working to stop this, rooted in the belief that education is key to empowering girls and young women so they are confident, skilled, strong and equipped to take charge of their future even in the most challenging circumstances. It’s well-documented that when girls and women thrive, families are healthier and communities are stronger. This new commitment in Jordan builds on the Always’ 30-year heritage of providing puberty and confidence education to more than 17 million girls around the world every year, and furthers P&G’s focus on and commitment to gender equality. It extends our existing partnership with UNESCO which has provided much-needed support to girls in Senegal and Nigeria to help them stay in school. This new initiative with UNESCO focuses on reaching young Syrian and Jordanian women, who have encountered significant challenges with continuing and completing basic education or pursuing training opportunities. The programme provides these young, at-risk women with life-skills and work readiness training, whilst encouraging shared experiences and an open dialogue between Syrians and Jordanians. It is designed to help the young women develop business and vocational skills to realise their potential. Always are also supporting a second programme with Save the Children; which expands our collective work, focused on helping thousands of adolescent South African and Nigerian girls stay in school. This programme provides homebound girls with life skills and educates their parents on the importance of supporting their daughters through puberty. The programme also involves local community support through formal and non-formal education, either in local schools or home-school efforts. Removing social and family barriers is important to ensuring girls have the confidence to grow and thrive. That’s why these efforts include training and education of parents and community members on topics including girls’ right to education, the role of women in society, and the importance of gender equality. The programmes aim to reach around 1000 girls and young women. Carolyn Tastad, Gender Equality Executive Sponsor and Group President of North America, P&G adds: “At P&G, we believe girls and women are a force for positive change in the world. Growing their knowledge and skills builds confidence and unleashes their full potential and power. Our commitment today as P&G and through our Always brand contributes to our aspiration to build a better world for all of us — a world free of gender bias." Those who want to support this commitment can donate to UNESCO and Save the Children funds, which will allow them to reach more girls and women with life-changing support.

But Mr Trew, who has spent 38 years in the industry, will not give up work entirely as he will stay on as part-time as director of community involvement for the hotel. Mr Trew, 66, said: I really very much enjoy working with people and Ive enjoyed every day of the time that Ive spent here. To this day, I look forward to coming to work. He added: The nice thing is that no two days are the same. Different things are coming your way, whether guest-related issues or staff issues  its really interesting. Im very fortunate in that the hotel has asked me to stay on three days a week  Im very much looking forward to that because I enjoy golf and that will allow me to get in two extra days playing golf. But Mr Trew, who began his career in 1979 as assistant front desk manager at the Fairmont Southampton, might never have joined the industry he came to love as he first took a degree in business administration at McMaster University in Canada and worked in accountancy for consumer goods firm Proctor & Gamble for several years before returning to Bermuda. He said: I always enjoyed working with people and after working for three years at Proctor & Gamble, I didnt meet anyone. After three years of that I wanted to try something different and returned home and opened a sweater shop  after three years of that, I joined the hotel. And since then he has swapped between Southampton and Hamilton in increasingly senior management posts before returning to the Hamilton Princess as hotel manager, in charge of day-to-day operations, in 2006. Mr Trew said: Over these years, Ive seen quite a few changes. Ive seen the hotels go from primarily being serviced by Bermudians and Ive certainly seen a change in the guests we now get. In the past few years, our guests have come with higher expectations. Bermuda is not an inexpensive destination and if they come with higher expectations, its up to us to deliver. He added: Because the hospitality industry is a seven-day operation, even though people dont work seven days, a lot of Bermudians at that time enjoyed their weekends off. There was a growing construction industry which led a lot of young locals away into that industry because their earning power was greater and they had their weekends off. But he said he was glad to see a drive, spearheaded by the Bermuda Hospitality Institute, to recruit more Bermudians into the industry. Mr Trew added: There is a sort of a turnaround and were seeing more interest by young Bermudians. He explained that many thought their options were limited to waiting duties or housekeeping. But he said: There are far greater opportunities than those two careers. We will do tours for schoolkids and well take them through the kitchens and show them the pastry chefs or butchers at work and its very nice to see the interest shown by young Bermudians in these areas. Mr Trews time at the Princess has seen the hotel transformed with a massive investment of around $100 million by new owners the Green family. He said: The changes that weve made here have been absolutely fantastic  and theyve come at the right time. Having been at the hotel for a number of years and seeing the state of the physical plant prior to the Greens buying it, I was almost every day wishing someone would come along with a lot of money and invest in us. For me, its been personally satisfying and personally and professionally challenging to see this whole project come to fruition. Mr Trew added that he had dealt with a few interesting situations over his career which still made him look back and laugh. He recalled a guest during one of his stints at the Fairmont Southampton who arrived without a booking from the UK and said that his visit would be paid for by a local travel agent, by arrangement with an overseas travel operator. Mr Trew checked the guest in and later called the travel agent who confirmed the story of the guest  who ran up a $25,000 bill in just three days. Mt Trew said: In ten days, the gentlemans bill was $84,000. He left us, we sent the bill to the local travel agent and they paid the money. Some time later, I was at home watching 60 Minutes on television and he was featured as a fraudster who was selling investment schemes to people. And he said of his new role as community ambassador: We get approached by a lot of local entities looking for support or in-kind donations Ill be looking after that and ensuring we get more involved in the local community. Jamahl Simmons, the Shadow Minister of Tourism, offered congratulations on behalf of the Progressive Labour Party. Mr Trew is a fine example of what we believe is Bermudas greatest tourism asset: hard working Bermudians in the industry, Mr Simmons said. We enthusiastically welcome his continued involvement in Tourism in his new role as director of community involvement for the hotel and wish him much success. Having had the pleasure of working with Mr Trew at The Hamilton Princess sister hotel, I can personally attest to his work ethic and commitment to quality service. His willingness and enthusiasm in encouraging and mentoring Bermudians in hospitality sets a high standard. Make text smaller Make text larger Comments You must be registered or signed-in to post comment or to vote.

The brands that flood the market today are the most effective in preventing oral disease and consumers can find pastes that do much more than just fight cavities. The toothpastes are many, as are their brand names. There are pastes that are natural, and there are others that are not. The following list are some brands that have been in the market over the years. Pepsodent and Close Up from Unilever Nigeria Plc, Macleans by Glaxosmithkline Nigeria Plc, MyMy from Daraju, Colgate from Colgate Palmolive, Oral-B from Procter and Gamble and Dabur from African Consumer Care Limited, AFCC, to mention but a few. Each boasts of a strong war chest of operating brand assets (strong pedigree, good products, strong distribution network and heavy advertising and marketing support). What singles each out is the level of marketing creativity deployed to outwit each other in the market place. Toothpastes are essentially the same thing, comparing ingredients in 15 toothpastes from brands such as Oral-B, Colgate, Macleans, Sensodyne etc. The 13 adult toothpastes looked at showed little difference in their active ingredients. Even though many products over time have since altered their formulations or names slightly, the same principles apply. Regrettably, only 33 percent of Nigerians brush twice daily, 46 percent brush once, while 15 percent do not brush, and that was one of the unique campaign methods deployed by some of the brands to warm themselves into the heart of consumers. In this guise, toothpaste manufacturers have been trapped in a rivalry that has seen them at each other’s throat, across Nigeria. According to Philip Kotler, a marketing professor, the challenger should not challenge the leader, but the threat by Oral-B has shown in the last five years that the postulation by Kotler is no longer relevant, particularly where the challenger has the financial muscle, and required finesse to fight the leader. “Dogs now eat the bone hung on their necks.” The new kid on the block, Oral-B, which barely launched into the Nigerian market in 2011 has been riding high in the market, while troubling its older and more established rivals. The brand is threatening dominance of the market with its just ended promotion that celebrated its fifth anniversary in Nigeria, a promo that saw the brand give out N70million cash and recharge cards to consumers. In addition to the consumer promotion, the brand visited various communities in Nigeria to provide free dental checks to people through its Mobile Dental Clinic Programme, which currently reaches more than two million Nigerians annually. Similar unique selling points According to the Brand Marketing Director, P&G Nigeria, Tolulope Adedeji, “over the past five years the brand has sponsored and partnered with government and private institutions to support oral hygiene for the average Nigerian.” In addition, she said, the brand has also received awards and recognition for quality toothpaste in Nigeria. Toothpaste brands have similar Unique Selling Points, USP, but what sets them apart is the important strategic and tactical activity they must constantly engage in. Vanguard investigations reveal that the gap between Oral-B and other toothpaste brands show a slim leadership margin, particularly for the leading brand. Of the 254 respondents interviewed, 90 used Oral-B during and after the promo, Close-up had 97 respondents, while 67 respondents switched between other brands and Oral-B, depending on which was available for purchase at various points of sale. The survey also showed that within the space of four years, Oral–B has achieved what other brands have built on overtime, reason being that it has built up affinity with consumers. The respondents, which included marketing researchers, believed that the other brand handlers need to dust up their advertising kits and introduce new campaigns to sustain top-of-the-mind awareness, just like Oral-B has pushed cavity fights forward to advance its cause. According to them, P&G’s campaign to get consumers to increase their brushing frequency to twice a day gives the impression that the toothpaste market is saturated. Executive Director, Andre Marketing, Ozigwo Emmanuel, recommends that companies should do better to feature campaigns that would strengthen emotional bonds with consumers who despite their strong purchasing power lack emotional product attachments.

La Monica   @lamonicabuzz January 18, 2017: 1:44 PM ET Ford CEO: Trump's proposed tariffs 'wouldn't be positive' If President-elect Donald Trump is able to get the economy growing at a faster clip, many giants of Corporate America will benefit. But there will also be some notable losers. The biggest beneficiaries are likely to be the companies that generate an overwhelming majority of their sales domestically. An increase in consumer spending in the U.S. would give a bigger boost to these firms than companies that rely more heavily on foreign markets. According to data from FactSet Research, nearly half of the companies in the S&P 500 index (240 to be precise) get more than 70% of their annual sales from the U.S. That list includes AT&T (T, Tech30) and Verizon (VZ, Tech30), Disney (DIS), Comcast (CMCSA) and Home Depot (HD). Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) and Starbucks (SBUX) are also on it. So is defense contractor Lockheed Martin (LMT), which has been a target of angry Trump tweets because of the cost of the F-35 jet. Walmart (WMT), American Express (AXP), UPS (UPS) and Netflix (NFLX, Tech30) are other high-profile companies that are all expanding abroad, but whose profits are still more closely tied to the U.S. Related: Corona has a Trump-Mexico problem These companies could get a lift from Trump's inward-looking policies if he and the Republican-led Congress boost funding for infrastructure projects and cut taxes as much as they are proposing. This stimulus could lead to higher levels of consumer and big business spending. That could also help Ford (F) and GM (GM) somewhat. Those companies, who have also been targets of Trump for operations they have in Mexico, each get a little more than 60% of their revenue from the U.S. Of course, there is no guarantee that Trump is going to get everything he wants from Congress. There's also the possibility that economic isolationism backfires and winds up hurting economic growth and U.S. consumers. Potential Losers Many big U.S. companies that rely heavily on foreign sales stand to lose if Trump's tough talk on tariffs winds up igniting a trade war. Boeing (BA) generates nearly 60% of its sales from outside the U.S. GE (GE), Coke (KO), McDonald's (MCD), Procter & Gamble (PG) and Nike (NKE) sell more of their products abroad than in the U.S. So it's possible that those stocks could lag versus those with more of a U.S. presence -- especially if the dollar picks up more steam. Although the dollar has started to weaken lately as Trump tries to talk it down, the greenback is still up significantly against other currencies since his election. Related: IMF thinks Trump stimulus will boost U.S. growth Investors think Trump's domestic focus should boost the dollar, which is bad for companies that sell more of their goods and services abroad -- and good for those which import less and focus on the U.S. That could hurt big tech firms Apple (AAPL, Tech30), Microsoft (MSFT, Tech30), Facebook (FB, Tech30) and Google-owner Alphabet (GOOGL, Tech30), which also get more than half their revenue from international markets. So do Intel (INTC, Tech30), Oracle (ORCL, Tech30) and IBM (IBM, Tech30). But these and other tech stocks have actually led the market lately due to hopes that Trump's proposed corporate tax changes will lead them to bring more cash that they have sitting overseas back to the U.S. The bet is that Apple and other giant tech firms may use that cash to hire more workers in the U.S., increase their dividends and buy back stock. That may be true, but these tech companies may also find it tougher to do business internationally if foreign governments retaliate against Trump with their own tariffs on U.S exports. Related: Trump's trade threats have CEOs running scared Another potential laggard? Oil giant ExxonMobil (XOM), whose former CEO Rex Tillerson is Trump's choice to be Secretary of State. ExxonMobil generated only a little more than a third of its overall sales in the U.S. in its most recent fiscal year. So unless oil prices skyrocket under Trump, it may not benefit as much from Trump's policies as other energy companies that have already positioned themselves to cash in on the U.S. shale boom. Under Tillerson's watch, ExxonMobil invested a lot more in oil reserves in deep-sea fields as well as the Russian Arctic region. It now seems to be playing catch up back in the U.S. ExxonMobil just announced plans this week to buy shale oil assets in the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico for $5.6 billion.

La Monica   @lamonicabuzz January 18, 2017: 1:44 PM ET Ford CEO: Trump's proposed tariffs 'wouldn't be positive' If President-elect Donald Trump is able to get the economy growing at a faster clip, many giants of Corporate America will benefit. But there will also be some notable losers. The biggest beneficiaries are likely to be the companies that generate an overwhelming majority of their sales domestically. An increase in consumer spending in the U.S. would give a bigger boost to these firms than companies that rely more heavily on foreign markets. According to data from FactSet Research, nearly half of the companies in the S&P 500 index (240 to be precise) get more than 70% of their annual sales from the U.S. That list includes AT&T (T, Tech30) and Verizon (VZ, Tech30), Disney (DIS), Comcast (CMCSA) and Home Depot (HD). Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) and Starbucks (SBUX) are also on it. So is defense contractor Lockheed Martin (LMT), which has been a target of angry Trump tweets because of the cost of the F-35 jet. Walmart (WMT), American Express (AXP), UPS (UPS) and Netflix (NFLX, Tech30) are other high-profile companies that are all expanding abroad, but whose profits are still more closely tied to the U.S. Related: Corona has a Trump-Mexico problem These companies could get a lift from Trump's inward-looking policies if he and the Republican-led Congress boost funding for infrastructure projects and cut taxes as much as they are proposing. This stimulus could lead to higher levels of consumer and big business spending. That could also help Ford (F) and GM (GM) somewhat. Those companies, who have also been targets of Trump for operations they have in Mexico, each get a little more than 60% of their revenue from the U.S. Of course, there is no guarantee that Trump is going to get everything he wants from Congress. There's also the possibility that economic isolationism backfires and winds up hurting economic growth and U.S. consumers. Potential Losers Many big U.S. companies that rely heavily on foreign sales stand to lose if Trump's tough talk on tariffs winds up igniting a trade war. Boeing (BA) generates nearly 60% of its sales from outside the U.S. GE (GE), Coke (KO), McDonald's (MCD), Procter & Gamble (PG) and Nike (NKE) sell more of their products abroad than in the U.S. So it's possible that those stocks could lag versus those with more of a U.S. presence -- especially if the dollar picks up more steam. Although the dollar has started to weaken lately as Trump tries to talk it down, the greenback is still up significantly against other currencies since his election. Related: IMF thinks Trump stimulus will boost U.S. growth Investors think Trump's domestic focus should boost the dollar, which is bad for companies that sell more of their goods and services abroad -- and good for those which import less and focus on the U.S. That could hurt big tech firms Apple (AAPL, Tech30), Microsoft (MSFT, Tech30), Facebook (FB, Tech30) and Google-owner Alphabet (GOOGL, Tech30), which also get more than half their revenue from international markets. So do Intel (INTC, Tech30), Oracle (ORCL, Tech30) and IBM (IBM, Tech30). But these and other tech stocks have actually led the market lately due to hopes that Trump's proposed corporate tax changes will lead them to bring more cash that they have sitting overseas back to the U.S. The bet is that Apple and other giant tech firms may use that cash to hire more workers in the U.S., increase their dividends and buy back stock. That may be true, but these tech companies may also find it tougher to do business internationally if foreign governments retaliate against Trump with their own tariffs on U.S exports. Related: Trump's trade threats have CEOs running scared Another potential laggard? Oil giant ExxonMobil (XOM), whose former CEO Rex Tillerson is Trump's choice to be Secretary of State. ExxonMobil generated only a little more than a third of its overall sales in the U.S. in its most recent fiscal year. So unless oil prices skyrocket under Trump, it may not benefit as much from Trump's policies as other energy companies that have already positioned themselves to cash in on the U.S. shale boom. Under Tillerson's watch, ExxonMobil invested a lot more in oil reserves in deep-sea fields as well as the Russian Arctic region. It now seems to be playing catch up back in the U.S. ExxonMobil just announced plans this week to buy shale oil assets in the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico for $5.6 billion.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it U.S. tax forms. (Getty Images/iStockphoto) By Robert J. Samuelson By Robert J. Samuelson January 18 Tax “reform,” starting with taxes on business, seems to be on everyone’s agenda, and it may be a place where the incoming Trump administration and its Democratic critics find common ground. But it’s still going to be a slog, and one reason is so-called pass-through businesses whose taxes are levied at personal income tax rates. When we think of business, the image that usually pops to mind is of the giant corporation: Google, General Motors, Procter & Gamble and their ilk. To be sure, these massive enterprises (known as “C” corporations) seem to dominate the business landscape and have their own tax rules, with a top federal rate of 35 percent. But behind the gigantic companies lie millions of smaller firms that aren’t C corporations. Their profits are “passed through” to the owners’ personal tax forms, where their business income is taxed at personal tax rates. The top federal rate is 43.4 percent, but the inclusion of state taxes can push that above 50 percent. Given the popularity of pass-through firms, they will likely play a big role in the tax debate. It also seems likely that they’ll push for lower taxes. This could be a major stumbling block, because (of course) tax cuts for pass-through firms will require spending cuts, tax increases on big C corporations or larger budget deficits. How many pass-through firms are there, and what’s their economic effect? You can be excused if you underestimate their impact. I certainly did. But a new report from the Tax Foundation, a think tank, dispels any notion that pass-through firms play a minor role in the economy. Here are some findings from the report: ● More than 90 percent of businesses in America are pass-through enterprises. In 2014, that was 28.3 million out of 30.8 million business establishments. ● Pass-through firms account for more than half of U.S. private-sector employment. In 2014, the number of workers at these firms totaled 73 million, compared with 54 million at C corporations. ●The total profits of pass-through firms have surpassed the profits of C corporations. In 2012, the net income was $1.6 trillion for pass-through firms and $1.1 trillion for C corporations. Pass-through businesses come in three varieties: sole proprietorships (firms with one owner); partnerships; and “S” corporations, which are corporations receiving pass-through tax treatment. Their number has grown rapidly. In 1980, the Tax Foundation reports, there were more C corporation tax returns filed than the combined total of sole proprietorships, partnerships and S corporations. By 2012, the number of pass-through returns was more than four times greater than the returns from C corporations. It’s not entirely clear what explains this surge. One cause was the Tax Reform Act of 1986, which lowered the top personal rate to 28 percent from 50 percent; that created a powerful incentive for firms to adopt pass-through status, especially with a higher top tax rate for C corporations. But as personal tax rates have been raised, this incentive weakened. The top personal and business rates are now near or above 50 percent, including state taxes. (The top federal corporate rate is 35 percent; but there are also taxes on dividends and capital gains, with a top tax rate of 23.8 percent.) Another explanation for the popularity of pass-through status is the spread of limited-liability company laws in states, which allow firms to curtail damages in case they’re sued, says the Tax Foundation’s Scott Greenberg. Rather than facing two types of taxation — corporate and personal — business owners may simplify by choosing personal tax rates. Whatever the explanation, the many pass-through taxpayers loom over the impending tax reform debate. Interestingly, the Tax Foundation suggests that the pass-through treatment should remain because it doesn’t discriminate against labor income. It is “difficult to justify why income from pass-through businesses should be subject to lower tax rates than income from wages and salaries,” the report says. No way will this be easy — and it’s not clear that overhauling business and personal taxes separately will make it any easier. Read more from Robert Samuelson’s archive.

FMCG companies start hiring in anticipation of a demand revival By Ratna Bhushan & Prachi Verma, ET Bureau | Updated: Jan 19, 2017, 09.55 AM IST Post a Comment READ MORE ON » Note ban | Jobs | fmcg | demonetisation | cash Crunch PepsiCo India chairman D Shivakumar acknowledged the impact of demonetisation on the consumer goods industry. “But we are hiring in expectation of a consumption revival,” he added. Budget 2017: This Budget could be the toughest test of Modi's life. Read about it in our Budget 2017 coverage NEW DELHI: Achhe din is back in sight for consumer goods companies, with the industry expecting consumption to bounce back from as early as next quarter as the impact of demonetisation fades away. The cash crunch post demonetisation did hurt them, said top industry executives. But they don’t expect it to last long or cause job losses. In fact, some of them have even started stepping up hiring in anticipation of a demand revival. “We have seen headwinds on demand, but there is no freeze on hiring or bonuses as growth will be back in the second and third quarters (of calendar 2017), and we have to be ready for that,” said Varun Berry, managing director at biscuit maker Britannia. PepsiCo India chairman D Shivakumar acknowledged the impact of demonetisation on the consumer goods industry. “But we are hiring in expectation of a consumption revival,” he added. Nestle, Procter & Gamble and Dabur also made similar views. Hindustan Unilever said it is business as usual for the company. Headhunters from Transearch, GlobalHunt and Korn Ferry said there was a slowdown in hiring at junior or middle levels in the FMCG sector after the November 8 demonetisation announcement, but that has changed now. In senior positions, there wasn’t any impact, they said. Neighbourhood stores that transact mostly in cash were among the biggest casualties of demonetisation, even as consumers visited modern retail outlets more frequently and paid electronically, cushioning the impact for the FMCG industry, company executives said. Across channels, the hit was mostly on non-premium categories targeting consumers with least purchasing power, but the highermargin premium products remained mostly insulated from the demand slowdown. While the situation is improving for both kirana stores and the organised ones in cities and big towns with easing money supply, rural markets remain a concern, said experts. “There was impact on demand and it was severe across consumer staples, considering that almost 90% of the sales traditionally happen across mom-and-pop stores,” Deloitte India partner Anil Talreja said. “But a demand and consumption recovery phase is kicking in and banks are returning to a level of normalcy. However, demand recovery in rural markets will take more time as transactions have been almost entirely cash dependent.” Rajat Wahi, partner and head (consumer markets) at KPMG, said even December was looking up in terms of demand, though the challenges on rural markets persisted. Arecent report from market researcher Nielsen confirmed the increasing consumer preference towards modern retail. With uncertainty over the availability of cash during November-December, modern trade shoppers took the opportunity to stock up, encouraged also by promotions and discounts from retailers and FMCG companies. In the two weeks after the currency ban, modern trade grew five times at a time when 70% neighbourhood groceries reported a fall in business, it said. Dabur chief executive Sunil Duggal said modern trade was an outperformer during the period of cash crunch that put pressure on the consumer goods industry. “We expect revival April onwards,” he added. According to the Nielsen report, even for grocery purchases, modern retail and online have become the channels of choice for many. This was perceptible in categories of household items (laundry, floor cleaner and utensil cleaner), personal care products (lotions, soaps and shampoos) and daily staples (milk, curd, fruits and vegetables). In the two weeks after demonetisation, packaged grocery saw 44% growth in modern retail sales compared with a year earlier, it said. Meanwhile, hirings at consumer goods companies are back to normal or picking up after a slowdown, executive search firms said, suggesting it as an indicator of improving demand situation in the industry. Hiring was slightly impacted till last month but that it is “back on track”, said Global-Hunt MD Sunil Goel. Stay on top of business news with The Economic Times App. Download it Now!

Albany, NY — (SBWIRE) — 01/18/2017 — The growing accessibility of raw materials such as corn, rapeseed, and soy in Indonesia, Malaysia, and China, manufacturers of fatty alcohols are focus on Asia Pacific instead of North America and Europe, states Transparency Market Research (TMR) in a research report. Manufacturers are thus motivated towards expanding their production divisions in the Asia Pacific region. Companies operating in the global fatty alcohols market can benefit from the opportunities arising from the escalating sales of beauty products and cosmetics in BRICS countries. The chief participants in the market include Wilmar International Ltd., Musim Mas Holdings, VVF L.L.C., Procter & Gamble Emery Oleochemicals, Ecogreen Oleochemicals, Kuala Lumpur Kepong Berhad, Kao Corporation, Royal Dutch Shell plc., and Sasol Limited. The global fatty alcohols market is expected to expand at a 5.1% CAGR from 2015 to 2023. The market is projected to rise to US$5.48 bn by the end of 2023 from a valuation of US$3.52 bn in 2014. GET PDF BROCHURE FOR MORE PROFESSIONAL AND TECHNICAL INDUSTRY INSIGHTS: http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag=S&rep_id=1279 Consumption of C11-C14 to Intensify across Several End-Use Industries On the basis of volume, the C11-C14 fatty alcohols surfaced as the leading product segment in the global market for fatty alcohols. In 2014, it accounted for a share of almost 50%. It is predicted to hold on to a lead until 2023. The chief cause behind the dominance of C11-C14 fatty alcohols is its wide-ranging application. C11-C14 is also projected to lead the market based on growth until 2023 closely trailed by C15-C22 fatty alcohols owing to its growing demand from various end-use industries. Among the applications, the detergents and soaps segment headed the market in 2014 with a share of around 60%. Nevertheless, personal care is expected to emerge as the leading segment in terms of growth. Geography-wise, the market has been classified into the Middle East and Africa, Latin America, Asia Pacific, Europe, and North America. Due to the rising disposable income of consumers, refining lifestyle, and rising population, the global fatty alcohols market is likely to be dominated by emerging economies in the near future. Outstanding to high consumption of fatty alcohols in India and China because of the burgeoning industrial sector, Asia Pacific has been projected to lead the market until 2023 closely trailed by North America owing implementation of stringent regulations. According to a TMR analyst, "The development of the Asia Pacific fatty alcohols market can be attributed to the rising consumption of beauty products, soaps and detergents, and abundance of raw materials. The European fatty alcohols market is likely to observe significant share loss to regions such as Central and South America and Asia Pacific." Browse The Full Article Here: http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/fatty-alcohols-market.html Personal Care to Contribute towards Market Growth Extensively The fields of application of fatty alcohols include metal working fluids, fragrances, flavors, plasticizers, cosmetics and personal care, and soaps and detergents. The global market for fatty alcohols is projected to upsurge in a substantial rate owing to the rising consumption of fragrances, cosmetics, beauty products, and other personal care products. The growth of the petrochemical industry is also one of the chief reasons behind the progress of the global market for fatty alcohols. Yet, the market is vulnerable to the shifting prices of raw materials and surplus production in the coming years. As synthetic fatty alcohols are factory-made using petrochemicals and petrochemicals are byproducts of crude oil, the fluctuating prices of oil are likely to unfavorably impact the sales fatty alcohols. Unsold stocks are also one of the key concerns of fatty alcohols manufacturers.

Podcasts & Newsletter Service Teaching German Teaching German DW im Unterricht Unterrichtsreihen Deutschlehrer-Info Germany World Business Science Environment Culture Sports TOP STORIES / Environment plastic waste Big businesses vow to tackle plastics problem At the World Economic Forum in Davos, major corporations have signed on to an initiative to better reuse and recycle plastic packaging - to reap economic benefits, and in hopes of stemming an environmental crisis. Unilever, Proctor and Gamble, Coca-Cola, Danone and Dow Chemical are among the heavy players in the 40 parties to have endorsed New Plastics Economy initiative Monday (16.01.2017) at the Swiss ski resort during the World Economic Forum (WEF). If enacted, the plan would see 70 percent of plastic packaging reused and recycled globally - five times more than the percentage currently estimated to be recycled. The New Plastics Economy plan, spearheaded by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation and unveiled at the WEF in January 2016, points out that, without urgent action, the planet's oceans will contain more plastic waste than fish by 2050. The action plan endorsed in Davos in 2017, which is based on the concept of a circular economy, said 20 percent of the world's plastic packaging could be profitably reused, and a further 50 percent recycled instead of becoming waste. Plastic packaging can be tricky to recycle Food and detergents multinational Unilever has now promised that all of its plastic packaging be fully reusable, recyclable or compostable by 2025. In a statement, Unilever CEO Paul Polman said: "We urgently need to transform global plastic packaging material flows if we are to continue to reap the benefits of this versatile material … it's now up to us all to get it done." New Plastics Economy estimates that about a quarter of all plastics that are produced end up as packaging. Most plastic is made from oil, and it requires significant energy to produce - which contributes to greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change. When plastics enter the natural environment as waste, this impacts wildlife and ecosystems; 10 to 20 million tons of plastic end up in the world's oceans every year. Two-thirds of all seabirds have consumed plastics, a 2015 study said. Fish, sea turtles, marine mammals and innumerable other sea creatures also consume plastics. Many ocean animals become entangled in plastic waste - this can lead to a painful death, as the creature slowly starves or suffocates. Although the full effects of animals consuming plastic waste have not been thoroughly studied, it is known to impair digestion, and can reduce the vigor of the organism. Microplastics can even end up on our own plates in seafood or ocean fish. Over the next year, the New Plastics Economy initiative and its partners will seek to innovate around redesigning plastic packaging. Fighting the plastic flood Tons of trash At least 8 million tons of plastic waste ends up in the world's oceans every year, according to a report by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation. The report warns plastic trash will outweigh fish by 2050 unless drastic action is taken. Much of the floating trash collects in several large ocean vortices far from land. Beaches, like this one on Midway Island in the remote Pacific Ocean, also suffer. Fighting the plastic flood Addicted to plastic The floating plastic isn't just an eyesore: as it breaks down into smaller pieces, marine animals mistake it for food. A recent study by Uppsala University showed ingesting plastic can have devastating effects on fish, including stunted growth and increased mortality rates. Surprisingly, some fish even seem to prefer plastic. Plastic in fish is also suspected of posing health risks for humans. Fighting the plastic flood Edible alternatives The Ocean Conservancy estimates more than 690 species of marine animals have been affected by plastic pollution. In an effort to reduce the impact of all that waste, some companies have come up with alternatives. The Delray Beach craft brewery, in Florida, has developed edible six-pack rings from wheat and barley left over from the brewing process. It hopes to begin production in October. Fighting the plastic flood Biodegradable packaging As an alternative to single-use plastic packaging - which makes up a significant portion of the waste found in oceans - some companies have come up with biodegradable alternatives. At a plant in Poland, wheat bran is being used. According to inventor Jerzy Wysocki, the Biotrem packaging can be used in the oven or freezer, and will decompose in 30 days - or can simply be eaten. Extra fiber! Fighting the plastic flood Bamboo to the rescue? Fast-growing bamboo is also an alternative to plastic - used to make everything from toothbrushes, shower curtains, utensils and even computer parts. Work at the Tonggu Jiangqiao Bamboo & Wood Industry Company, pictured here, started mass production of bamboo keyboards, mice and monitor casings in 2008. Fighting the plastic flood Ocean skimmer Alternatives may help reduce waste, but millions of tons of plastic still float around the world's oceans - and will remain for centuries, slowly breaking down. Dutch foundation Ocean Cleanup aims to collect the trash with a 100-kilometer (60-mile) floating dam system that is supposed to trap plastic waste without harming fish and other sea creatures. It aims to install one in the Pacific by 2020. Fighting the plastic flood From trash to fashion Some of that plastic could be recycled and reused in other forms, becoming flower pots, home insulation or - in the case of Spanish firm Ecoalf - clothing. The Madrid-based clothing line takes plastic waste collected by 200 fishing boats in the Mediterranean, crushes it into flakes, and then creates polyester fibers - which in turn become fashionable jackets, backpacks and other items. Fighting the plastic flood Reduce, recycle ... and reuse Plastic waste can also be reused in its original form.

Podcasts & Newsletter Service Teaching German Teaching German DW im Unterricht Unterrichtsreihen Deutschlehrer-Info Germany World Business Science Environment Culture Sports TOP STORIES / Environment plastic waste Big businesses vow to tackle plastics problem At the World Economic Forum in Davos, major corporations have signed on to an initiative to better reuse and recycle plastic packaging - to reap economic benefits, and in hopes of stemming an environmental crisis. Unilever, Proctor and Gamble, Coca-Cola, Danone and Dow Chemical are among the heavy players in the 40 parties to have endorsed New Plastics Economy initiative Monday (16.01.2017) at the Swiss ski resort during the World Economic Forum (WEF). If enacted, the plan would see 70 percent of plastic packaging reused and recycled globally - five times more than the percentage currently estimated to be recycled. The New Plastics Economy plan, spearheaded by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation and unveiled at the WEF in January 2016, points out that, without urgent action, the planet's oceans will contain more plastic waste than fish by 2050. The action plan endorsed in Davos in 2017, which is based on the concept of a circular economy, said 20 percent of the world's plastic packaging could be profitably reused, and a further 50 percent recycled instead of becoming waste. Plastic packaging can be tricky to recycle Food and detergents multinational Unilever has now promised that all of its plastic packaging be fully reusable, recyclable or compostable by 2025. In a statement, Unilever CEO Paul Polman said: "We urgently need to transform global plastic packaging material flows if we are to continue to reap the benefits of this versatile material … it's now up to us all to get it done." New Plastics Economy estimates that about a quarter of all plastics that are produced end up as packaging. Most plastic is made from oil, and it requires significant energy to produce - which contributes to greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change. When plastics enter the natural environment as waste, this impacts wildlife and ecosystems; 10 to 20 million tons of plastic end up in the world's oceans every year. Two-thirds of all seabirds have consumed plastics, a 2015 study said. Fish, sea turtles, marine mammals and innumerable other sea creatures also consume plastics. Many ocean animals become entangled in plastic waste - this can lead to a painful death, as the creature slowly starves or suffocates. Although the full effects of animals consuming plastic waste have not been thoroughly studied, it is known to impair digestion, and can reduce the vigor of the organism. Microplastics can even end up on our own plates in seafood or ocean fish. Over the next year, the New Plastics Economy initiative and its partners will seek to innovate around redesigning plastic packaging. Fighting the plastic flood Tons of trash At least 8 million tons of plastic waste ends up in the world's oceans every year, according to a report by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation. The report warns plastic trash will outweigh fish by 2050 unless drastic action is taken. Much of the floating trash collects in several large ocean vortices far from land. Beaches, like this one on Midway Island in the remote Pacific Ocean, also suffer. Fighting the plastic flood Addicted to plastic The floating plastic isn't just an eyesore: as it breaks down into smaller pieces, marine animals mistake it for food. A recent study by Uppsala University showed ingesting plastic can have devastating effects on fish, including stunted growth and increased mortality rates. Surprisingly, some fish even seem to prefer plastic. Plastic in fish is also suspected of posing health risks for humans. Fighting the plastic flood Edible alternatives The Ocean Conservancy estimates more than 690 species of marine animals have been affected by plastic pollution. In an effort to reduce the impact of all that waste, some companies have come up with alternatives. The Delray Beach craft brewery, in Florida, has developed edible six-pack rings from wheat and barley left over from the brewing process. It hopes to begin production in October. Fighting the plastic flood Biodegradable packaging As an alternative to single-use plastic packaging - which makes up a significant portion of the waste found in oceans - some companies have come up with biodegradable alternatives. At a plant in Poland, wheat bran is being used. According to inventor Jerzy Wysocki, the Biotrem packaging can be used in the oven or freezer, and will decompose in 30 days - or can simply be eaten. Extra fiber! Fighting the plastic flood Bamboo to the rescue? Fast-growing bamboo is also an alternative to plastic - used to make everything from toothbrushes, shower curtains, utensils and even computer parts. Work at the Tonggu Jiangqiao Bamboo & Wood Industry Company, pictured here, started mass production of bamboo keyboards, mice and monitor casings in 2008. Fighting the plastic flood Ocean skimmer Alternatives may help reduce waste, but millions of tons of plastic still float around the world's oceans - and will remain for centuries, slowly breaking down. Dutch foundation Ocean Cleanup aims to collect the trash with a 100-kilometer (60-mile) floating dam system that is supposed to trap plastic waste without harming fish and other sea creatures. It aims to install one in the Pacific by 2020. Fighting the plastic flood From trash to fashion Some of that plastic could be recycled and reused in other forms, becoming flower pots, home insulation or - in the case of Spanish firm Ecoalf - clothing. The Madrid-based clothing line takes plastic waste collected by 200 fishing boats in the Mediterranean, crushes it into flakes, and then creates polyester fibers - which in turn become fashionable jackets, backpacks and other items. Fighting the plastic flood Reduce, recycle ... and reuse Plastic waste can also be reused in its original form.

The plan was announced at the World Economic Forum in the Swiss ski resort, where powerful executives are gathering just days ahead of the inauguration of Donald Trump as US president, who views concern about such environmental issues with suspicion. The planet's dangerously polluted oceans will contain more plastic waste than fish by 2050 if urgent action isn't taken, the companies warned. Answering a call by British sailor and philanthropist Ellen MacArthur, multinationals such as Unilever and Procter and Gamble made a commitment to increase recycling and cut back overall use. Food-to-detergents giant Unilever said it would ensure that all of its plastic packaging "is fully reusable, recyclable or compostable by 2025". The Davos initiative said 20 percent of the world's plastic production could be profitably re-used and a further 50 percent recycled instead of infesting landfills and killing wildlife in the ocean. But even then, "without fundamental redesign and innovation, the remaining 30 percent of plastic packaging (by weight) will never be recycled and the equivalent of 10 billion garbage bags per year will be destined to landfill or incineration", the WEF said. "The 'New Plastics Economy' initiative has attracted widespread support, and across the industry we are seeing strong initial momentum and alignment on the direction to take," said MacArthur, who is a regular Davos presence along with celebrities such as Matt Damon. Other companies backing the initiative include Coca-Cola, Danone and Dow Chemical. "Plastics are the workhorse material of the modern economy -– with unbeaten properties," said Martin Stuchtey, a professor for resource management at Innsbruck University in Austria who is working on the programme. "Minor changes in material, format and treatment ... can make the economics of recycling viable and take us into a positive spiral of ... lower costs and better design," he said.

(GuruFocus) Many market observers speculating that the Federal Reserve could raise interest rates multiple times this year following just one increase in each of the past two years. Couple that with some investors theorizing 3 percent Treasury yields would spell doom for the bond bull market, high dividend stocks and exchange-traded funds could come under pressure. There are plenty of ETFs that, while focusing on payout strategies, do not emphasize high dividend names and/or defensive, rate-sensitive sectors. That group includes the Schwab Strategic Trust (NYSE: SCHD). The ETF And Her Index The $4.9 billion SCHD tracks the Dow Jones Dividend 100 Index, which along with a quality mandates that constituent firms have a dividend increase streak of at least 10 years. As highlighted by top 10 holdings such as Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ), Procter & Gamble Co (NYSE: PG) and The Coca-Cola Co (NYSE: KO), many of SCHD's 114 holdings have payout increase streaks spanning much longer than 10 years. A Quiet Entrance Still, SCHD has not set the world on fire since coming to market in 2011. “Since its inception in October 2011, SCHD has managed to keep pace with its average peer in the large-value category. The fund's middling performance over this span can be largely attributed to the fact that high-quality stocks have lagged both the broader market as well as higher-beta, lesser-quality firms,” said Morningstar in a recent note. With a focus on dividend consistency and growth, it is not surprising that SCHD's largest sector weight is consumer staples at over a quarter of the ETF's weight. Talk About A Tech Allocation! However, SCHD also has one of the largest allocations to technology stocks among all dividend ETFs at nearly 21.5 percent. That is notable for multiple reasons, including tech's dividend ascent over the past few years and the sector's stout cash piles, which should ensure dividend growth going forward. “Relative to its large-cap dividend-oriented peers, this fund will likely generate an income stream that is more stable and that should grow with time. This is reflective of the methodology of its underlying benchmark, which specifically targets high-quality, steady dividend payers, and is not--as some of competing funds' benchmarks are — tuned to isolate constituents exclusively on the basis of high current and/or prospective payouts or yields,” according to Morningstar. With an annual expense ratio of 0.07 percent, or $7 per $10,000 invested, SCHD is the least expensive dividend ETF on the market. Yes, even less expensive than its Vanguard equivalents.

The plan was announced at the World Economic Forum in the Swiss ski resort, where powerful executives are gathering just days ahead of the inauguration of Donald Trump as US president, who views concern about such environmental issues with suspicion. The planet's dangerously polluted oceans will contain more plastic waste than fish by 2050 if urgent action isn't taken, the companies warned.

The Davos initiative said 20% of the world's plastic production could be profitably re-used and a further 50% recycled instead of infesting landfills and killing wildlife in the ocean. But even then, "without fundamental redesign and innovation, the remaining 30% of plastic packaging (by weight) will never be recycled and the equivalent of 10 billion garbage bags per year will be destined to landfill or incineration", the WEF said.

Mind Click was recently acquired by e-learning firm Learning Pool – ranked as one of the fastest-growing technology businesses in Ireland. It has now announced plans to create new jobs at its Strelley Hall base, where it works with clients such as Boots, Procter & Gamble and Sky, as it launched a new graduate programme. The company, which employs more than 40 staff, also hopes to relocate to Nottingham city centre later this year to accommodate the anticipated growth and attract the county's most talented workforce. Sean Reddington, Mind Click managing director, said: "Growing with Mind Click has been an incredible journey and now we've teamed up with Learning Pool we have over 400 joint clients, giving us the capability to expand even further. "Our new partnership has already opened up multiple job opportunities for people in Nottingham and we are expecting further capacity for multiple strategic hires in the New Year in tandem with our big office move to the city centre."

After acquiring Mind Click in September last year, it created up to 10 jobs in Nottingham and boosted its joint workforce to 120 people – making it the largest provider of Totara learning management systems (LMS) in the global network. It aims to continue focusing on innovation to deliver "first-class learning solutions" to both public and private sector clients across the UK and internationally. This includes "gamification", where video games are used to encourage engagement with a product, as well as creating virtual environments and fresh visuals to learn about topics. It also builds programmes for controlling training schemes, while helping users switch between platforms containing course content, such as Moodle and Blackboard. Learning Pool, which was given the highest accreditation of three stars in the Sunday Times Best Companies to Work For 2016, already has a scholarship scheme in place, as well as five IT student placements with permanent job prospects. The company is now looking to open up similar career opportunities with Mind Click for graduates with aspirations to work in the technology sector. There is currently one graduate vacancy, included within the eight other jobs initially made available within the business. These roles are across a range of departments, including sales and marketing, technical support and project management. Georgia Avery, a recent graduate who works at Mind Click as a solutions architect, said: "It's a challenge to follow your desired career path straight out of university but Mind Click offered me a fantastic opportunity with a graduate scheme that has allowed me to boost my confidence and excel my career in the technology industry.

"It's such an exciting and fulfilling company to be a part of. The unique, fun and family-like working culture in both Mind Click and Learning Pool is unparalleled and I'm excited to progress my career with the inspirational organisation." Paul McElvaney, CEO at Learning Pool, said: "2016 was a whirlwind year for us. We secured significant investment from Carlyle Cardinal Ireland, welcomed the talented Mind Click team into the Learning Pool family and now we're looking for even more enthusiastic people to join our team in Northern Ireland and throughout the UK. "These appointments will allow us to build out our technology at a quicker pace for our customer's benefit. I'm excited about the next phase of Learning Pool's growth that will see us deliver more product innovation and significant expansion of our customer base and our team."

Home Industry Coca-Cola’s #BrotherlyLove campaign missing the local Indian flavour Coca-Cola’s #BrotherlyLove campaign missing the local Indian flavour Though running global campaigns across markets isn’t new, advertisers agree that localising is important to create a connect. By: Meghna Sharma | Published: January 17, 2017 6:50 AM Though running global campaigns across markets isn’t new, advertisers agree that localising is important to create a connect. For a major multinational company to run its global campaign across markets is not a new phenomenon. Every now and then, a single campaign is aired across regions to emphasise on the brand’s message and vision. Or often, their ‘locally’ adapted versions. Most global campaigns tend to focus on universal truths: emotions that resonate with people all across the globe — love, sex and peace. And then each of these can have their own avatars. For instance, for 2016 Rio Olympics, P&G ran its tear-jerker Thank you, Mom ad from the Wieden & Kennedy stable, continuing a six-year run with a two-minute film depicting the strong mothers behind Olympic athletes. You May Also Like To Watch This: Now consider Coca-Cola India which has launched #BrotherlyLove, a commercial capturing the camaraderie between two brothers. The film, released on YouTube late last month, is the brand’s Indian execution of the international ad which was launched in January 2016. The film highlights the unique and challenging relationship experienced between two brothers. When the younger brother finds himself without his ice-cold Coca-Cola and is bullied by other kids, his big brother comes to the rescue. Following the ‘one brand’ strategy of introducing one single iconic brand campaign that celebrates both the product and the brand, Coca-Cola launched the Indian version of the Brotherly Love TVC which depicts everyday moments of life. “We have a bouquet of ads as part of our global Taste the Feeling campaign from which we choose the ads which are best suited to the Indian context and reality,” says a Coca-Cola spokesperson. “Brotherly Love’s Indian version differs from the global campaign in terms of the nature of playful bullying between brothers around Coca-Cola along with new situations added to bring in freshness to the ad campaign.” “Love can be segmented into a spouse’s love, a lover’s love, a wife’s love, sisterly love, brotherly love and more. Coke has used one of these segmented positions to popularise itself,” says Harish Bijoor, brand expert and founder of Harish Bijoor Consults. This is not the first time the company has done so.

Newslook Still waiting for Dow 20,000: A hat made by trader Peter Tuchman is seen on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on Jan. 6, 2017. (EPA/JUSTIN LANE) (Photo: JUSTIN LANE, EPA) 48 CONNECTTWEET 9 LINKEDIN 5 COMMENTEMAILMORE This is not a kiss and tell story: The fact is the on-again, off-again romance between the Dow and the 20,000 milestone is officially on hold. The Dow Jones industrial average’s flirtation with 20,000 has cooled since Jan. 6 when the stock index faced a football-style fourth-and-inches market moment but was stopped 0.37 points short of its history-making milestone. What postponed the Dow 20,000 party? In the seven trading days since the Dow was turned back just shy of the 20,000 mark, the 30-stock index has been in retreat. It has finished lower six of the past seven sessions. And after Wednesday’s drop of 22 points to 19,804.72, it is nearly 200 points away from the milestone. USA TODAY Ask Matt: Is it time to get aggressive with stocks? So what gives? * “Trump rally” matures. Dow 20,000 is just a number. But the near-miss milestone coincided with a stock market that had run far and fast since Election Day. From the first day of trading after Donald Trump won the White House until Jan. 6, when the Dow came within a whisker of topping 20,000, the Dow surged nearly 1,700 points, or 9.1%. The bulk of those gains were driven by hope. Investors began pricing in a stronger economy and better corporate earnings based on Trump’s business-friendly policy proposals. Profit-taking was bound to kick in, especially since the Dow was at its most “overbought” level since November 1996, according to Mark Arbeter, president of Arbeter Investments. “The sugar high is wearing off,” Terri Spath, chief investment officer at Sierra Investment Management, wrote in a recent report. * Stocks go flat after downgrade. On Jan. 9, the first trading day after the Dow came closest to 20,000, Goldman Sachs slowed its climb further when it downgraded fellow Dow components Coca-Cola and Procter & Gamble to “sell” investment recommendations. That helped push shares of the stocks lower. * Financials fizzle. Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and other Dow financial shares shot up after Trump’s win. The idea of less regulation of banks, a better economy and the prospect for rising interest rates put banks in the "Trump Rally" sweet spot. But the bank-fueled rally has stalled since Jan. 6, the same day the Dow came within a single point of 20,000. Goldman Sachs ran up 35% from Election Day until Jan. 6, and was the Dow’s top performer in that span. But since then, it has been among the Dow’s worst performers, tumbling more than 4%. In a sign of how the bank rally has stalled, Goldman shares fell 0.6% Wednesday despite reporting quarterly earnings and revenue results that exceeded analyst expectations. “The first leg of the ‘Trump trade' is largely over,” Jason Trennert of Wall Street firm Strategas Research Partners, said in a note. “The next leg of the Trump trade will come when we learn more about specifics of corporate tax reform and deregulation.” * Imaginary ceiling halts rise. Big round numbers like Dow 20,000 often act like an impenetrable ceiling that take time to break through and then act as a magnet for a period of time. The best example might be what happened to the Dow around 1,000, says Bob Baur, chief global economist at Principal. He notes that the Dow came within five points of topping 1,000 back in February 1965. But the Dow didn’t close above 1,000 until Nov. 14, 1972, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. The Dow didn’t say goodbye to 1,000 for good until 1982, or 10 years later.

She said: ‘There have been signs of a lack of trust, lack of hope and disenchantment.  It's a fact: International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde warned of a ‘lack of trust’ If you combine that with lower growth, more inequality and much more transparency, you have the good ingredients for a crisis of the middle classes in advanced economies.’ Blame game  Italy’s finance minister declared that the European Union was partly to blame for the surge in populism and disaffection across the Continent. Pier Carlo Padoan said European institutions were no longer seen as the solution to the plight of the eurozone and wider EU. He said: ‘There is a tendency to say our problems are generated in Brussels or Frankfurt. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 2 Next ALEX BRUMMER: The IMF and the unelected elite who hold sway...

Share this article Share ‘Europe used to be the solution to many of the problems of the laggards of European integration. Now this is being turned around completely.’ Chinese dinner  The hottest ticket so far this week in Davos was an invite to lunch with Chinese president Xi Jinping at a fancy hotel, the egg-shaped Intercontinental. Guests including IMF head Lagarde, Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani boss of Reliance Industries, and Procter & Gamble chief David Taylor heard Xi expand on his speech making the case for globalisation. Despite warnings over a trade war – a dig at the US – he left locked in whispered conversation with Blackstone Group founder Steve Schwarzman, perhaps Wall Street’s most committed China fan. Drone busters Snipers are a regular sight on the rooftops of Davos. But this year an extra piece of equipment is visible: anti-drone jammers. Resembling massive machine guns, they are designed to disable drones that could either be used to spy on the world’s elite or launch a terror attack.

Former Saatchi & Saatchi chairman Kevin Roberts. Photo / Richard Robinson Last July, Kevin Roberts, then-chairman of Saatchi & Saatchi, was hosting a 50-person birthday dinner for his daughter-in-law at his home in the UK's Lake District when he got a text message. An interview he'd given to Business Insider weeks before had hit the Internet. In it he commented that the gender debate in the advertising industry was "over" and that many women lacked "vertical ambition." The story was trending fast on Twitter. Oops. As guests were arriving and later sitting down to table, Roberts spoke twice with his PR adviser in the US, Brian Sweeney. For the next 72 hours, he reached out to clients and colleagues across three continents to clarify his comments, while juggling the rest of the weekend party. But the day after the dinner, Maurice Levy, chief executive officer of parent company Publicis Group, announced he was putting Roberts on leave, saying his views didn't reflect those of the group. Within days, after thousands of angry posts about him being an out-of-touch "old white guy," Roberts, one of the industry's best-known and powerful advertising executives, resigned. "In hindsight I absolutely wish I hadn't said that," he said in a wide-ranging interview. "I was very confusing. I actually completely misunderstood that I was giving an interview that would be judged on Twitter." Subtler Message It may seem surprising that Roberts, who built his entire career on getting companies to adopt effective messaging, was completely taken aback by the ferocity of the response on social media. Continued below. Related Content Clive Palmer claims council workers killed his deer Your views: Readers' letters Small businesses upbeat about year ahead Roberts, 67, who recently became chairman of UK communications firm Beattie, said what he was trying to advance was a more subtle message, which got lost in the firestorm that followed. Firestorms over the gender debate have hit the ad industry before. Last year, a female employee of J. Walter Thompson filed a discrimination lawsuit accusing the agency's CEO, Gustavo Martinez, of making racist and sexist comments. He later resigned. Back in 2005, Neil French, then worldwide creative director of WPP, quit amid outrage over his comments at an industry event that women don't "make it to the top because they don't deserve to. They're crap." Roberts, who says his motto is "fail fast, learn fast and fix fast," thinks his comments last summer led to "pretty fast failure." That after 20 years at Saatchi and previous executive positions at Procter & Gamble and PepsiCo. Everyone has moved on. My feeling is whether you want a top job or not is not a gender issue, it's a lifestyle issue. As many women want a top job as men. Kate Stanners He says his comments were misconstrued. "I felt the debate now was not about gender but really about how to inspire everyone irrespective of gender to be the best they can be," he said. His point, he says: "Let's not stop talking about race or class or gender, let's more start talking about inclusion." Demeaning Comments A 2016 survey of 600 women in advertising by the 3% Conference, a group that advocates the advancement of female creative talent in the industry, found that 91 per cent of women have heard demeaning comments from male colleagues and 54 per cent have been subjected to unwanted sexual advances. The advertising world remains a tough place for women to get ahead on their own merits, said Kat Gordon, founder of the organisation. "He's discounting what women want and are up against," Gordon said. "They do have ambition and they're hitting these speed bumps over and over again. Ad agencies are not meritocracies or free of sexism and there are not equal opportunities." Many women at Publicis were upset by Roberts's comments, said Kate Stanners, who was then the firm's worldwide chief creative officer. She later also took on the role of chair, replacing Roberts. Stanners said women currently hold half the top jobs -- managing director and above -- at Saatchi in London, where the firm is headquartered. And in the last few months, "Everyone has moved on. My feeling is whether you want a top job or not is not a gender issue, it's a lifestyle issue. As many women want a top job as men." Roberts, who was already due to retire in May 2017, the same time as Levy's planned departure, is now advising several companies in his native New Zealand, in addition to his role at Beattie. He hasn't backed away entirely from his original comments, saying many women -- and men -- don't desire to move up the ladder. "Some people want to do work rather than manage work," he said. "I don't think that's a lack of ambition. Frankly, I think it's a higher ambition."

File photo next play/pause pre Belleville News By Jack Evans Belleville - Despite confirmation of a shortfall of more than $153,000 for its 2016 campaign, the annual breakfast meeting for the United Way of Hastings and Prince Edward Wednesday morning was very much a celebratory event. It was, after all, a chance to thank the woman credited with being the sparkplug for many successful capital fundraising campaigns for the United Way, locally. Undeniably, however, the only dash of cold water on the celebration was the earlier announcement by executive director Judi Gilbert that she is retiring from her position and will not lead the agency for its 2017 campaign. But, that didn’t slow a large crowd of staff, volunteers and United Way supporters from giving her a warm send-off as she reviewed six campaigns and the teamwork and support she enjoyed along the way. Staffer Lyndsey Harker noted that in the six years Gilbert headed the agency, she guided the agency to raise a total of almost $12 million. “That is no mean feat,” she declared. She also praised Gilbert’s leadership, dedication, teamwork spirit and interest and concern for her staff. In her opening remarks, Gilbert said the loss of more than $150,000 from this year’s original campaign goal will definitely create some impacts on the community for at least some of the almost 40 community service agencies the United Way helps to support. Apportionment of the proceeds and the shortfall remain to be worked out, she said. She affirmed that the goal for the 2017 campaign will remain the same in spite of the past year’s difficulties. “We cannot, in good conscience, lower our target when we know how badly these dollars are needed by local charities,” she said. But she also stressed that achieving almost $2 million remains something to celebrate. Gilbert also introduced Rene Veillette, chair of the 2016 campaign and managing director of Hanon Systems in Belleville. Also recognized was local entrepreneur Maurice Rollins, sponsor of the Leadership Challenge Fund, which matches dollar for dollar any donation of $1,000 or more.  His entire commitment of $100,000 for the drive was reached and matched, doubling the impact of those donations. Representation from Belleville and Quinte West councils, 8 Wing Trenton and area MPP Todd Smith were among special guests at the breakfast, as were representatives from long-time supporter Procter and Gamble. Announced was the Volunteer of the Year award, named in honour of Jack Hartling, a former Belleville police officer and recipient of the award. It went to Carmela Ruberto, an employee of Hastings County, a former United Way board member and active volunteer, spearheading the workplace campaign for the county employees and more. Active community volunteer Shelley Wert also got an award for long -term commitment to The United Way. “This is where I say my goodbye,” said Gilbert in conclusion. “What continues to strike me is your generosity as volunteers and your unwavering commitment to the United Way and to your community.  You give financially even though we are all feeling the pinch of our current economy. It has been my absolute honour to have held this position with United Way and thank you for your support of the 2016 campaign.” | (0) Comment Join The Conversation Sign Up Login Latest Local News News 10 dead puppies found in box: police Snapshot News Massive hangar, 4 years in the building, finally opens at 8 Wing Snapshot News Short chase, long list of charges Snapshot News Peer Support offers open door, open minds Snapshot The Hot List: Top 10 cottage rental locations in Ontario Sponsored content Most Read SEE MORE New owner of Marmora Valu Mart, it’s official Massive hangar, 4 years in the building, finally opens at 8 Wing Trent Hills shrimp farmers receive award for agri-food innovation excellence Assisted living housing project will be unveiled next month Peer Support offers open door, open minds In Your Neighbourhood Today How content marketing can boost your business more than traditional marketing In the race to get the attention of customers with the highest potential, content marketing has...

La Monica NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- If President-elect Donald Trump is able to get the economy growing at a faster clip, many giants of Corporate America will benefit. But there will also be some notable losers. The biggest beneficiaries are likely to be the companies that generate an overwhelming majority of their sales domestically. An increase in consumer spending in the U.S. would give a bigger boost to these firms than companies that rely more heavily on foreign markets. According to data from FactSet Research, nearly half of the companies in the S&P 500 index (240 to be precise) get more than 70% of their annual sales from the U.S. That list includes AT&T and Verizon, Disney, Comcast and Home Depot. Berkshire Hathaway and Starbucks are also on it. So is defense contractor Lockheed Martin, which has been a target of angry Trump tweets because of the cost of the F-35 jet. Walmart, American Express, UPS and Netflix are other high-profile companies that are all expanding abroad, but whose profits are still more closely tied to the U.S. These companies could get a lift from Trump's inward-looking policies if he and the Republican-led Congress boost funding for infrastructure projects and cut taxes as much as they are proposing. This stimulus could lead to higher levels of consumer and big business spending. That could also help Ford and GM somewhat. Those companies, who have also been targets of Trump for operations they have in Mexico, each get a little more than 60% of their revenue from the U.S. Of course, there is no guarantee that Trump is going to get everything he wants from Congress. There's also the possibility that economic isolationism backfires and winds up hurting economic growth and U.S. consumers. Potential Losers Many big U.S. companies that rely heavily on foreign sales stand to lose if Trump's tough talk on tariffs winds up igniting a trade war. Boeing generates nearly 60% of its sales from outside the U.S. GE, Coke, McDonald's, Procter & Gamble and Nike sell more of their products abroad than in the U.S. So it's possible that those stocks could lag versus those with more of a U.S. presence -- especially if the dollar picks up more steam. Although the dollar has started to weaken lately as Trump tries to talk it down, the greenback is still up significantly against other currencies since his election. Investors think Trump's domestic focus should boost the dollar, which is bad for companies that sell more of their goods and services abroad -- and good for those which import less and focus on the U.S. That could hurt big tech firms Apple, Microsoft, Facebook and Google-owner Alphabet, which also get more than half their revenue from international markets. So do Intel, Oracle and IBM. But these and other tech stocks have actually led the market lately due to hopes that Trump's proposed corporate tax changes will lead them to bring more cash that they have sitting overseas back to the U.S. The bet is that Apple and other giant tech firms may use that cash to hire more workers in the U.S., increase their dividends and buy back stock. That may be true, but these tech companies may also find it tougher to do business internationally if foreign governments retaliate against Trump with their own tariffs on U.S exports. Another potential laggard? Oil giant ExxonMobil, whose former CEO Rex Tillerson is Trump's choice to be Secretary of State. ExxonMobil generated only a little more than a third of its overall sales in the U.S. in its most recent fiscal year. So unless oil prices skyrocket under Trump, it may not benefit as much from Trump's policies as other energy companies that have already positioned themselves to cash in on the U.S. shale boom. Under Tillerson's watch, ExxonMobil invested a lot more in oil reserves in deep-sea fields as well as the Russian Arctic region. It now seems to be playing catch up back in the U.S. ExxonMobil just announced plans this week to buy shale oil assets in the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico for $5.6 billion.

But there will also be some notable losers. The biggest beneficiaries are likely to be the companies that generate an overwhelming majority of their sales domestically. An increase in consumer spending in the U.S. would give a bigger boost to these firms than companies that rely more heavily on foreign markets. According to data from FactSet Research, nearly half of the companies in the S&P 500 index (240 to be precise) get more than 70% of their annual sales from the U.S. That list includes AT&T and Verizon, Disney, Comcast and Home Depot. Berkshire Hathaway and Starbucks are also on it. So is defense contractor Lockheed Martin, which has been a target of angry Trump tweets because of the cost of the F-35 jet. Walmart, American Express, UPS and Netflix are other high-profile companies that are all expanding abroad, but whose profits are still more closely tied to the U.S. These companies could get a lift from Trump’s inward-looking policies if he and the Republican-led Congress boost funding for infrastructure projects and cut taxes as much as they are proposing. This stimulus could lead to higher levels of consumer and big business spending. That could also help Ford and GM somewhat.

Leisure Home LBoard COMMENT A nation of bystanders Mariam Mokhtar Read More FMT BAHASA FMT BORNEO+ FMT VIDEO CONTRIBUTE NEWS HOME NATION OPINION WORLD LEISURE SPORTS BUSINESS ADVERTISE WITH US Words can cost you your job Bloomberg | January 18, 2017 A 2016 survey of 600 women in advertising found that 91% of women have heard demeaning comments from male colleagues and 54% were subjected to unwanted sexual advances. LONDON: Last July, Kevin Roberts, then-chairman of Saatchi & Saatchi, was hosting a 50-person birthday dinner for his daughter-in-law at his home in the UK’s Lake District when he got a text message. An interview he’d given to Business Insider weeks before had hit the Internet. In it he commented that the gender debate in the advertising industry was “over” and that many women lacked “vertical ambition”. The story was trending fast on Twitter. Oops. As guests were arriving and later sitting down to table, Roberts spoke twice with his PR adviser in the US, Brian Sweeney. For the next 72 hours, he reached out to clients and colleagues across three continents to clarify his comments, while juggling the rest of the weekend party. But the day after the dinner, Maurice Levy, chief executive officer of parent company Publicis Group, announced he was putting Roberts on leave, saying his views didn’t reflect those of the group. Within days, after thousands of angry posts about him being an out-of-touch “old white guy”, Roberts, one of the industry’s best-known and powerful advertising executives, resigned. “In hindsight I absolutely wish I hadn’t said that,” he said in a wide-ranging interview. “I was very confusing. I actually completely misunderstood that I was giving an interview that would be judged on Twitter.” Subtler message It may seem surprising that Roberts, who built his entire career on getting companies to adopt effective messaging, was completely taken aback by the ferocity of the response on social media. Roberts, 67, who recently became chairman of UK communications firm Beattie, said what he was trying to advance was a more subtle message, which got lost in the firestorm that followed. Firestorms over the gender debate have hit the ad industry before. Last year, a female employee of J Walter Thompson filed a discrimination lawsuit accusing the agency’s CEO, Gustavo Martinez, of making racist and sexist comments. He later resigned. Back in 2005, Neil French, then worldwide creative director of WPP, quit amid outrage over his comments at an industry event that women don’t “make it to the top because they don’t deserve to. They’re crap”. Roberts, who says his motto is “fail fast, learn fast and fix fast”, thinks his comments last summer led to “pretty fast failure”. That after 20 years at Saatchi and previous executive positions at Proctor & Gamble Co and PepsiCo Inc. He says his comments were misconstrued. “I felt the debate now was not about gender but really about how to inspire everyone irrespective of gender to be the best they can be,” he said. His point, he says: “Let’s not stop talking about race or class or gender, let’s more start talking about inclusion.” Demeaning comments A 2016 survey of 600 women in advertising by the 3% Conference, a group that advocates the advancement of female creative talent in the industry, found that 91% of women have heard demeaning comments from male colleagues and 54% have been subjected to unwanted sexual advances. The advertising world remains a tough place for women to get ahead on their own merits, said Kat Gordon, founder of the organisation. “He’s discounting what women want and are up against,” Gordon said. “They do have ambition and they’re hitting these speed bumps over and over again. Ad agencies are not meritocracies or free of sexism and there are not equal opportunities.” Many women at Publicis were upset by Roberts’s comments, said Kate Stanners, who was then the firm’s worldwide chief creative officer. She later also took on the role of chair, replacing Roberts. Stanners said women currently hold half the top jobs – managing director and above – at Saatchi in London, where the firm is headquartered. And in the last few months, “Everyone has moved on. My feeling is whether you want a top job or not is not a gender issue, it’s a lifestyle issue. As many women want a top job as men.” Roberts, who was already due to retire in May 2017, is now advising several companies in his native New Zealand, in addition to his role at Beattie. He hasn’t backed away entirely from his original comments, saying many women – and men – don’t desire to move up the ladder. “Some people want to do work rather than manage work,” he said. “I don’t think that’s a lack of ambition. Frankly, I think it’s a higher ambition.” Comments Readers are required to have a valid Facebook account to comment on this story. We welcome your opinions to allow a healthy debate.

According to a new study added to the vast portfolio of Market Research Hub (MRH), The United States of America represents the largest market for hair care products under the personal and beauty care segment. This study is entitled as "Consumer and Market Insights: Haircare Market in the U.S.", which provides insights on high growth categories of hair care to target trends in the usage of packaging materials, types and category level distribution data & brands market shares. According to the key findings, the U.S. haircare market is forecasted to exhibit a CAGR of 0.7% during the years 2015-2020. It is well known that hair care products help to protect and nourish the hair and reduce damage. Also, tedious and tiring life, as well as the harmful elements in the environment, leads to dull and damaged hair. Thus, to overcome this issue, now hair care products are used by hair care professionals in salons and also by an individual at home. It has also been observed by the study that rising consumption of hair care products, especially among the youth, and the consumer's recent increase in fashion consciousness will boost the market in the U.S. during the forecasted period. Additionally, factors like the early adoption of hair dyes and the increased usage of hair colors by the public in the U.S. region will raise the prospects for growth in this market until 2020.

According to the type of hair and its requirements, there are different categories of hair care products available in the market such as shampoo, conditioner, hair styling gels, hair loss treatments, colorants, serums, hair spray, glazes and hair accessories which are precisely covered in the study. Among these, wide adoption of shampoo as a hair care item in the U.S. resulted in the growth of this segment. On the other hand, salon hair care is estimated to witness the rapid value growth during the forecast period of 2015-2020. In this subsequent section, distribution data coverage including the percentage of sales within each category through distribution channels such as convenience stores, Hypermarkets & Supermarkets, Health & Beauty Stores, department stores, drug stores & pharmacies etc. are also provided.

He says his comments were misconstrued.  “I felt the debate now was not about gender but really about how to inspire everyone irrespective of gender to be the best they can be,” he said.  His point, he says: “Let’s not stop talking about race or class or gender, let’s more start talking about inclusion.”  Demeaning Comments A 2016 survey of 600 women in advertising by the 3% Conference, a group that advocates the advancement of female creative talent in the industry, found that 91 percent of women have heard demeaning comments from male colleagues and 54 percent have been subjected to unwanted sexual advances. The advertising world remains a tough place for women to get ahead on their own merits, said Kat Gordon, founder of the organization. “He’s discounting what women want and are up against,’’ Gordon said. “They do have ambition and they’re hitting these speed bumps over and over again. Ad agencies are not meritocracies or free of sexism and there are not equal opportunities.”  Many women at Publicis were upset by Roberts's comments, said Kate Stanners, who was then the firm’s worldwide chief creative officer. She later also took on the role of chair, replacing Roberts. Stanners said women currently hold half the top jobs -- managing director and above -- at Saatchi in London, where the firm is headquartered. And in the last few months, “Everyone has moved on. My feeling is whether you want a top job or not is not a gender issue, it’s a lifestyle issue. As many women want a top job as men.”  Roberts, who was already due to retire in May 2017, is now advising several companies in his native New Zealand, in addition to his role at Beattie. He hasn’t backed away entirely from his original comments, saying many women -- and men -- don’t desire to move up the ladder. “Some people want to do work rather than manage work,’’ he said. “I don’t think that’s a lack of ambition. Frankly, I think it’s a higher ambition.” To contact the author of this story: Stephanie Baker in London at stebaker@bloomberg.net.

An interview he’d given to Business Insider weeks before had hit the Internet. In it he commented that the gender debate in the advertising industry was “over” and that many women lacked “vertical ambition”. The story was trending fast on Twitter. Oops. As guests were arriving and later sitting down to table, Mr Roberts spoke twice with his PR adviser in the US, Mr Brian Sweeney. For the next 72 hours, he reached out to clients and colleagues across three continents to clarify his comments, while juggling the rest of the weekend party. But the day after the dinner, Mr Maurice Levy, chief executive officer of parent company Publicis Group, announced he was putting Mr Roberts on leave, saying his views didn’t reflect those of the group. Within days, after thousands of angry posts about him being an out-of-touch “old white guy”, Mr Roberts, one of the industry’s best-known and powerful advertising executives, resigned. “In hindsight I absolutely wish I hadn’t said that,” he said in a wide-ranging interview. “I was very confusing. I actually completely misunderstood that I was giving an interview that would be judged on Twitter.” SUBTLER MESSAGE It may seem surprising that Mr Roberts, who built his entire career on getting companies to adopt effective messaging, was completely taken aback by the ferocity of the response on social media. Mr Roberts, 67, who recently became chairman of UK communications firm Beattie, said what he was trying to advance was a more subtle message, which got lost in the firestorm that followed. Firestorms over the gender debate have hit the ad industry before. Last year, a female employee of J Walter Thompson filed a discrimination lawsuit accusing the agency’s CEO, Mr Gustavo Martinez, of making racist and sexist comments. He later resigned. Back in 2005, Mr Neil French, then worldwide creative director of WPP, quit amid outrage over his comments at an industry event that women don’t “make it to the top because they don’t deserve to. They’re crap”. Mr Roberts, who says his motto is “fail fast, learn fast and fix fast”, thinks his comments last summer led to “pretty fast failure”. That after 20 years at Saatchi and previous executive positions at Proctor & Gamble Co. and PepsiCo Inc. He says his comments were misconstrued. “I felt the debate now was not about gender but really about how to inspire everyone irrespective of gender to be the best they can be,” he said. His point, he says: “Let’s not stop talking about race or class or gender, let’s more start talking about inclusion.” DEMEANING COMMENTS A 2016 survey of 600 women in advertising by the 3% Conference, a group that advocates the advancement of female creative talent in the industry, found that 91 per cent of women have heard demeaning comments from male colleagues and 54 per cent have been subjected to unwanted sexual advances.

Home Market Commodities Demonetisation impact to remain only for short term: GHCL MD Ravi S Jalan Demonetisation impact to remain only for short term: GHCL MD Ravi S Jalan GHCL — which has businesses across textiles, soda ash and edible salt segments--says the impact of demonetisation, especially on FMCG sales, is going to be only short term. Ravi S Jalan, the managing director of GHCL, says demonetisation will pay “rich dividends” in terms of higher tax mop-up by the government and more transparency in business transactions over the longer term. By: Banikinkar Pattanayak | Published: January 18, 2017 6:35 AM Ravi S Jalan, the managing director of GHCL GHCL — which has businesses across textiles, soda ash and edible salt segments–says the impact of demonetisation, especially on FMCG sales, is going to be only short term. Ravi S Jalan, the managing director of GHCL, says demonetisation will pay “rich dividends” in terms of higher tax mop-up by the government and more transparency in business transactions over the longer term. He also says India now accounts for roughly a half of the sheet imports by the US, which is a remarkable feat. In an interview to FE’s Banikinkar Pattanayak, Jalan pitches for an FTA with the EU to further improve the country’s competitiveness in textiles and garments in that key market. Excerpts: GHCL is a big player in some of the most labour-intensive industries, such as textiles, soda ash and edible salt. How has demonetisation impacted you? Demonetisation is an effective way to increase tax collection and boost the economy. The textile sector is also responding well to this move. We have always believed that strong, transparent systems should be in place for conducting businesses. Even much before demonetisation, we had started the practice of paying our labourers through cashless modes. Hence we haven’t witnessed any challenges during this period. To what extent do you think demonetisation has affected your revenue or profits in the third quarter? Our production level has been good, but our FMCG sales have been slightly impacted due to lower demand, especially in rural areas. While the situation is improving, it could take a few months to offset the impact completely. You have been a supplier to big companies like Target and Bed Bath & Beyond. Is the flow of orders from the US or the EU for Indian textile players recovering or is it still tepid? India’s share in the sheet imports by the US is increasing year on year. In the last two years, it has been well past 50%, compared with 47% previously. This is mainly due to the reliability of Indian exporters as well as the consumption growth in China. This 3% increase on a huge base like the US provides ample growth opportunity Also, we hope that a free trade agreement (FTA) with the EU will make Indian exporters competitive in that key market. (For instance, industry executives say, Indian yarn, fabrics and garments attract export duties of 4%, 5% and 9.6%, respectively, in the EU, while competitors like Bangladesh export there at zero duty). Watch This Also: How much of a goods and services tax (GST) rate would you suggest for textiles and garments? There are some players who seem to favour even 12%. I think a zero GST rate will be the best for the textiles and garments sector, which is one of the largest contributors to the country’s gross domestic product (GDP), rural employment and foreign exchange. Also, the sector shouldn’t be exempted from the GST ambit as it will give rise to cascading effects in costs for the entire textile value chain. When the GST is in place, it will create a level-playing field for everyone and will be positive, particularly for companies, such as GHCL, with integrated processing facilities (For integrated players, the input tax costs can be seamlessly offset against output tax liability). GHCL is one of the largest manufacturers and exporters of soda ash, with customers like HUL, P&G and Philips. How do you see rural demand shaping up for FMCG products in the coming quarters? The economy has witnessed mammoth process of demonetisation and it has its short-term impacts too. At present, we see some improvement in the demand trend in FMCG, but it will take some more time to be back to normal completely. How much of a rise do you see in your revenue and profits in 2016-17, compared with a year earlier? What is driving your growth? GHCL’s revenue has grown 1.9% to R703.14 crore during the second quarter of this fiscal, against R690.34 crore a year earlier. However, during the first half of this fiscal, the company registered 72.4% growth in net profits to R193.11 crore, against R112.04 crore in the same period the previous year. GHCL’s income rose 9.3% to R1,429.83 crore in the first half of 2016-17, compared with R1,308.54 crore a year before. We are targeting year-on-year growth of 20% in our profits. As far as growth in revenues is concerned, there would be a marginal rise, as our capacity expansion in soda ash will be in operation next year. Apart from a strong work force, the company has benefited from lower prices of commodities, especially coal. What are your expansion plans? We have various expansion plans for both inorganic chemicals and textiles segments. Our expansion in soda ash is on track and we expect it to be completed in the current quarter. This will result in a 12% rise in production volumes, with additional 1,00,000 tonnes brownfield capacity. The total capex outlay for the project was R375 crore. An incremental capex of around R80 crore has been allocated for debottlenecking soda ash capacity by 25,000 tonnes, apart from doubling the sodium bicarbonate capacity (It will be raised by 30,000 tonnes). In the textiles segment, we have allocated R70 crore towards the expansion of our processing capacity from 36 million meters to 45 million meters, along with building capacity for producing value-added yarn and expanding weaving capacity.

Toolkit 2017, Warc's guide to six major marketing trends for the year ahead, shows that brands are structuring social video content to grab viewers' attention within three seconds – the typical window they may have while users are scrolling through their news feeds. But the report adds that measurement will be a major challenge in 2017, especially after Facebook's admission it had been significantly overestimating average viewing times. That said, the social networking giant's scale means that, whatever its deficiencies regarding metrics, it remains the lead platform when it comes to audience reach and popularity and so benefits from the rise of a 'broadcast' approach to social media. (Non-subscribers can download a sample of this Toolkit chapter here.) Commenting on the trend, Ian Forrester, Global VP of Insight at Unruly, adds that while brands will often turn first to Facebook and YouTube, they should remember that many views take place outside of these two platforms. "Lots of people never go on Facebook or YouTube so consider the open web as well as part of your distribution strategy." The Toolkit report further observes that while brands are now investing in paid distribution, sharing remains a useful indicator of engagement with a video and advises aligning the characteristics of the content to the particular behavioural factors, such as the pursuit of social currency, that motivate the engagement. At the same time, brands need to avoid falling into the "crap trap" of bombarding consumers with inconsistent, incoherent and irrelevant messaging – something Procter & Gamble has confessed to being guilty of – and focus instead on craft and creativity. That requirement has become urgent as so much social media use now takes place on mobile, where video may be skipped or viewed without sound. Research has shown that creative designed with the small screen and small attention span of users in mind can generate huge uplifts in ad effectiveness. That may mean, for example, using captions or ensuring that key visual elements such as logos, are proportionally bigger than they would be in a TV ad in order to be noticed.

Posted 18 Jan 2017 05:32 Updated 18 Jan 2017 05:40 Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. (AP Photo/Richard Drew) Enlarge Caption  Email More A A NEW YORK: Financial shares and biotechs were among the biggest losers on Tuesday (Jan 17) as US stocks retreated ahead of the presidential inauguration of Donald Trump. Banking stocks, a winner since Trump's election, stumbled badly, with Goldman Sachs losing 3.3 per cent and Citigroup 2.1 per cent. Both companies report earnings on Wednesday. "There's some profit taking setting in with regards to financials," Bill Lynch, director of investment at Hinsdale Associates. "Given the fact they've done so well since the election based on the prospects of higher interest rates and deregulation, maybe they've come too far too fast." Banks have led a major stock rally since Trump's election Nov 8. But trade has been choppy the last couple of weeks. Pharma stocks were also weak, with Merck losing 1.4 per cent, Celgene 2.2 per cent and Gilead Sciences 1.6 per cent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 58.96 points (0.30 per cent) to 19.826.77. The broad-based S&P 500 shed 6.75 points (0.3 per cent) to 2,267.89, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index tumbled 35.39 points (0.63 per cent) to 5,538.73. Consumer staples stocks were higher, with Procter & Gamble rising 1.4 per cent, Target 1.1 per cent and Wal-Mart 1.9 per cent. Wal-Mart announced it was creating 10,000 jobs in the US in an announcement applauded by Trump. Mattel jumped 4.7 per cent after announcing that Margaret Georgiadis had been named chief executive. She previously worked as president of Americas at Google. Qualcomm tumbled 4.0 per cent on news that the Federal Trade Commission filed a complaint charging the company with using anti-competitive tactics in the supply of a key semiconductor device used in cell phones and other consumer products. - AFP/de Email More YOU MAY ALSO LIKE From Our Website From the Web Happening Now new window view more My Facebook Friends Back To Top JUMP TO Select Section Asia Pacific Singapore World Business Sport Entertainment Technology Health Lifestyle Videos Weather Photos Special Reports Archives Services PSI Navigate to: News TV Connect Watch Live GET OUR APPS iPhone/iPad Android Get Our News Facebook Twitter Linkedin YouTube Mobile SMS eNews RSS News Asia Pacific World Sport Technology Lifestyle Photos Archives Singapore Business Entertainment Health Videos Special Reports TV Live News Schedule Shows Services Weather ADVERTISE WITH US Online Mobile TV Contact Sales Channel NewsAsia Channel News Asia About Us Coverage Hotel Partners Events & Seminars Presenters & Correspondents Contact Us Mediacorp Mediacorp News Group © 2017 About Mediacorp Pte Ltd Terms and Conditions Privacy Policy Back To Top

Finance Search Banks, biotechs lead US stocks lowerAFP – Tue, Jan 17, 2017 10:28 PM AEDT Related Content View Photo At the closing bell, the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average had fallen 0.1 percent to 19,804.72, while the broader S&P 500 gained 0.2 percent to 2,271.89 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq rose 0.3 percent to 5,555.65 Financial shares and biotechs were among the biggest losers Tuesday as US stocks retreated ahead of the presidential inauguration of Donald Trump. Banking stocks, a winner since Trump's election, stumbled badly, with Goldman Sachs losing 3.3 percent and Citigroup 2.1 percent. Both companies report earnings Wednesday. "There's some profit taking setting in with regards to financials," Bill Lynch, director of investment at Hinsdale Associates. "Given the fact they've done so well since the election based on the prospects of higher interest rates and deregulation, maybe they've come too far too fast." Banks have led a major stock rally since Trump's election November 8. But trade has been choppy the last couple of weeks. Pharma stocks were also weak, with Merck losing 1.4 percent, Celgene 2.2 percent and Gilead Sciences 1.6 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.3 percent to 19.826.77. The broad-based S&P 500 shed 0.3 percent to 2,267.89, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index tumbled 0.6 percent to 5,538.73. Consumer staples stocks were higher, with Procter & Gamble rising 1.4 percent, Target 1.1 percent and Wal-Mart 1.9 percent. Wal-Mart announced it was creating 10,000 jobs in the US in an announcement applauded by Trump. Mattel jumped 4.7 percent after announcing that Margaret Georgiadis had been named chief executive. She previously worked as president of Americas at Google. Qualcomm tumbled 4.0 percent on news that the Federal Trade Commission filed a complaint charging the company with using anticompetitive tactics in the supply of a key semiconductor device used in cell phones and other consumer products.

Today, tech vendor Cloverleaf is launching artificial intelligence-powered digital signs that slide over retailers' shelves to give marketers insights about who is standing in front of their store displays. Procter & Gamble has tested the technology—dubbed shelfPoint—and Dell is currently using it in a Micro Center store in Houston, Texas. "We're able to gather insights about what shoppers are doing in front of the shelf itself, engage them and convert the sale to get them to throw one more item into the basket," explained Gordon Davidson, founder and CEO of Cloverleaf.

A PwC survey of nearly 1,400 CEOs released on the eve of the annual World Economic Forum in Davos found that 29 per cent expected global economic growth to pick up this year, up from 27 per cent last year. It found that 38 per cent were very confident they could increase revenue growth in the next year, up from 35 per cent at the same time last year, which was a six-year low. REUTERS Firms agree to reduce plastic use Forty of the world's biggest companies that are assembled in Davos have agreed to come up with cleaner ways to make and consume plastic as waste threatens the global ecosystem, especially in oceans. The planet's dangerously polluted oceans will contain more plastic waste than fish by 2050 if urgent action is not taken, the companies warned. Answering a call by British sailor and philanthropist Ellen MacArthur, multinationals such as Unilever, Procter and Gamble, The Coca-Cola Company and Dow Chemical made a commitment to increase recycling and cut back overall plastic use. AGENCE FRANCE PRESSE Clean energy pitch for Trump Dr Bertrand Piccard, the Swiss pilot who circumnavigated the world in a solar-powered plane, wants to convince United States President-elect Donald Trump that investing in clean energy is key to creating jobs and growth. Dr Piccard, chief executive officer of Solar Impulse, wants to meet Mr Trump after he has been inaugurated to highlight the falling costs of renewables compared with fossil fuels, he said in an interview ahead of the World Economic Forum in Davos. "If they want to make America great again, they will need to use clean technologies and renewable energies," Dr Piccard said in a phone interview from Munich. "You will not have growth with old technologies." BLOOMBERG A version of this article appeared in the print edition of The Straits Times on January 18, 2017, with the headline 'In Brief'.

Photo / AP The US dollar fell after President-elect Donald Trump said the currency was "too strong," undermining the nation's competitiveness abroad. Trump, who will be sworn in on Friday, made the comments in an interview with the Wall Street Journal. "The dollar is the guiding light at this point, and all eyes are on the shape US policy will take," Fredrik Nerbrand, global head of asset allocation at HSBC Holdings in London, told Bloomberg. "I would put today's dollar weakness down to noise rather than a structural shift. "If Trump wants to become as growth-generative as he's planning to be and you don't have the same fiscal push coming from the rest of the world, then it's a question of where does the capital flow to," Nerbrand noted. "The dollar is the tallest pygmy." Meanwhile, the British pound strengthened after UK Prime Minister Theresa May eased some nerves about the country's pending exit from the European Union when she said the nation's parliament will get a vote on the final terms of the Brexit deal, though her comments made clear she is seeking a so-called hard exit-the country will leave the EU's single market. "I want to be clear: What I am proposing cannot mean membership of the single market," said May. "Instead we seek the greatest possible access to it through a new comprehensive, bold and ambitious free trade agreement." Wall Street moved lower. In 1.20pm trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.1 per cent, while the Nasdaq Composite Index slid 0.5 per cent.

While you were sleeping: Dollar too strong for Trump Jan. 18 (BusinessDesk) – The US dollar fell after President-elect Donald Trump said the currency was “too strong,” undermining the nation’s competitiveness abroad. Trump, who will be sworn in on Friday, made the comments in an interview with the Wall Street Journal. “The dollar is the guiding light at this point, and all eyes are on the shape US policy will take,” Fredrik Nerbrand, global head of asset allocation at HSBC Holdings in London, told Bloomberg. “I would put today’s dollar weakness down to noise rather than a structural shift. “If Trump wants to become as growth-generative as he’s planning to be and you don’t have the same fiscal push coming from the rest of the world, then it’s a question of where does the capital flow to,” Nerbrand noted. “The dollar is the tallest pygmy.” Meanwhile, the British pound strengthened after UK Prime Minister Theresa May eased some nerves about the country’s pending exit from the European Union when she said the nation’s parliament will get a vote on the final terms of the Brexit deal, though her comments made clear she is seeking a so-called hard exit—the country will leave the EU’s single market. “I want to be clear: What I am proposing cannot mean membership of the single market,” said May. “Instead we seek the greatest possible access to it through a new comprehensive, bold and ambitious free trade agreement.” Wall Street moved lower. In 1.20pm trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.1 percent, while the Nasdaq Composite Index slid 0.5 percent. In 1.06pm trading, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index declined 0.2 percent. Meanwhile, US Treasuries rose, pushing yields on the 10-year note eight basis points lower to 2.32 percent. Gold, another safe-haven trade, also gained. US financial markets were closed on Monday for Martin Luther King Jr Day. The Dow slid as declines in shares of JPMorgan Chase and those of Goldman Sachs, recently 3.1 percent and 2.4 percent weaker respectively, outweighed gains in shares of Wal-Mart and those of Procter & Gamble, up 2.1 percent and 1.5 percent respectively. Wal-Mart said it plans to create about 10,000 US jobs this year through the opening of 59 new, expanded and relocated Walmart and Sam’s Club facilities as well as e-commerce services. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index ended the session with a 0.2 percent decline from the previous close. Germany’s DAX Index slipped 0.1 percent, while France’s CAC 40 Index fell 0.5 percent. The UK’s FTSE 100 Index dropped 1.5 percent, as the pound’s rebound hurt shares of exporters.

Related Stories Stocks rise as oil climbs ahead of OPEC meeting Dow breaks through 19,000 U.S. stock indexes extend record highs Canada's economy could see an upswing in 2017 — here are 5 reasons why There are few things economic experts agree on. That the Dow Jones Industrial Average is ridiculous as an economic indicator is one. That its milestones are meaningless is another. For weeks now, headlines have been breathlessly anticipating the Dow breaking through the 20,000-point mark. Never mind that the much broader S&P500 has hit new all-time highs since Donald Trump was elected, as has the technology-focused Nasdaq — it's usually "the Dow" that claims top billing in newscasts and business pages. It finally passed the milestone on January 25th, and was met with more of the same. And yet, just about everyone who knows anything about it will tell you it is a deeply flawed, overly simplistic, wildly inaccurate measure of either the economy or stock markets. 'It just happens to be wrong' "It's actually a pretty bad metric," says John Shoven from the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research. "It's poorly constructed. Its only claim to fame is that it's been around for 120 years." Before we even tackle the arcane way the Dow is calculated, let's address the milestone. "It's just a round number," says Shoven, who has criticized the Dow and our obsession with milestones in the past. "There's nothing more significant about it crossing 20,000 than when it crossed 17,500 or any other number." Dow within reach of 20,000 milestone6:18 Every time it goes up, it hits a new all-time high; we arbitrarily celebrate some more than others. When you look at the Dow's methods, things get even muddier. The Dow puts 30 big-name U.S. companies in a basket and adds up the total dollar value of all those stocks. It doesn't adjust for inflation. Dow tops 19,000 for first time The Dow has its own divisor, a figure it uses and changes over time to try to adjust for stock splits or spinoffs. As such, it gives more influence to expensive stocks. So if two companies are worth about the same amount, if one has fewer shares that are worth more, that company has an oversized influence on the average. "It's simple," says Shoven. "It just happens to be wrong." Math was really hard — in 1896 And why, you may ask, does a major stock market index use such a simplistic method? Because when the index was created back in 1896, computers didn't yet exist. "The Dow Jones is just a relic from old days, when computation was difficult," says Ronald Balvers, professor of finance at the DeGroote School of Business at Hamilton's McMaster University. He says the Dow is built the way it is because that was the easiest way to add things up 120 years ago. The Dow has been flirting with 20,000 for weeks now. It closed at 19,911.21 on December 13, 2016. (Drew Angerer/Getty Images) That basket of 30 companies has traditionally been something of a relic, as well. Apple was only added in 2015. General Electric has held a spot since 1907. Proctor and Gamble's been listed since 1932 and Dupont since 1935.  Balvers says that means the index offers a limited scope into market activity. "We're not including bonds, we're not including real estate, we're not including small companies, so from that perspective it's a bit of a very select measure of the performance of financial markets," Balvers says. It's misleading, too  Worse yet, Shoven says, the Dow does not include dividends. So it doesn't come close to reflecting total returns for shareholders. If the Dow had added dividends back when it overhauled the index in 1928, it would be approaching a very different milestone today. 5 reasons Canada's economy is looking up in 2017 "If you had the total return index," he says, the Dow "would be well over 500,000 today, approaching a million. On the very long run, it's off — it's way off." So keep all this in mind as you are inundated with blaring headlines about the Dow breaking through 20,000. It is a snapshot of a particular group of stocks and it provides some limited historical context. The Dow Jones is a dated relic of an older time. Traders keep an eye on it, but most use other indexes as a more accurate measure of market activity. (Mark Lennihan/Associated Press) What the Dow does do is show a very broad trend in stock markets. "I would say it is right directionally," says Shoven. "It indicates that stock prices have gone up over the long haul — and indeed they have." The Dow is up, as is the S&P 500 and almost every other North American stock index. But the whole point of an index like this is to help us understand something about the stock market and about the state of the economy at large. And on that, the Dow is an indisputably lousy indicator.

African governments are promoting value-addition. / Appolonia Uwanziga. More in Business Annual EPRN meet to discuss ways to keep economy competitive RRA donates Rwf45m to build homes for Genocide survivors in Ngoma Appetite for RNIT Iterambere Fund reinvestment option surges further Africa is home to seven of the 10 fastest-growing economies in the world, and despite the pre-conceived ideas of a continent forever plagued by disease, war and turmoil, it is rapidly becoming one of the most desirable investment destinations. The past two years have, however, not been easy for the continent. In 2015, GDP growth slowed to 3.0 per cent, down from 4.5 per cent in 2014 due to an economic slump, while low commodity prices continued to impede growth last year, and expansion decelerated to lows not seen since the 2009 global financial crisis. However, I believe the continent will bounce back this year. Here’s why. While the headlines might be all about falling commodity prices, here on the ground I’m seeing something different: an environment where private sector-led investment is starting to flourish, thanks to economic and political reforms by governments. Indeed, the business landscape has been rapidly changing, due to increased regional mobility, rapid urbanisation and population growth, all of which has boosted demand for African-made products and services. This, coupled with strong interconnectedness and a sense of pan-Africanism, has brought much optimism for businesses operating in the region. With the public sector facilitating the establishment of Africa’s biggest economic bloc, which could culminate in a Free Trade Area, spanning Cape to Cairo, the next great investment destination for 2017 may very well be Africa. Take the example of agri-business, which has and always will be at the centre of growth in the continent. Recently, the continent has seen a surge of innovations that are accelerating agricultural productivity. For instance, new platforms are providing farmers data on commodity prices, the availability of buyers and sellers, and guidance on best practices in harvesting and disease management. Four signs that things are looking up in Africa The rise of these innovations speaks to the progress and potential of Africa’s economy more broadly, its people and their ability to identify localised solutions for growth. But this isn’t the only clue as to Africa’s potential. In fact, I see four key trends driving large-scale private sector growth on the continent. These trends are, not only shaping the strategies for existing companies, but have also influenced the nature and appetite for joint venture projects across the continent. Processing and value-addition For a long time, development practitioners have emphasised need to give more attention to the processing of raw agricultural produce rather than exporting unprocessed agricultural commodities. Indeed, African governments have been promoting value-addition for economic development for years, and yet there are still plenty of investment opportunities. Over 80 per cent of value in the global food industry is in value-added components such as sorting, cleaning and packaging fruits and vegetables. The various forms of value-addition provide opportunities for the private sector to expand their commercial activities and access higher-value markets, either for domestic consumers or exports. Not only do they provide employment at all levels, but they have proven time and time again to drastically change the economic landscape of countries. A good example of this is Kenya; the export value of fresh vegetables grew by as much as 250 per cent after it stopped simply exporting raw material and started incorporating value-added tasks such as cleaning, packaging and freezing products. Similar to the fruit and vegetables sub-sectors, Africa’s cotton and apparel value chain have joined forces to integrate the global textile supply chain. In South Africa, the Aid by Trade Foundation entered into a partnership with the African Cotton and Textiles Industries Federation to promote the sustainable cotton and textile industry in sub-Saharan Africa. The objective of this partnership was to increase productivity, competitiveness and sustainability of cotton production, and thus strengthen textile production in Africa. In Tanzania, the MeTL Group started out with cotton ginning operations for export. We then opened four textile factories for spinning and weaving of cotton in Tanzania and Mozambique. Today, we have launched our first ever garmenting factory which manufactures school uniforms, T-shirts and several cotton-apparel by-products. With its growing population and increasingly skilled labour force, Africa is ideally placed to benefit from processing and value-addition across the agro-processing sub-sector. Fast-moving consumer goods for Africa by Africa Africa is home to one of the world’s fastest growing populations and an exploding middle-class with more disposable income than ever before. As a result, there is high demand for fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG), such as apparel, hygiene products, food and electronics. Currently, almost all these products are still being imported. FMCG retailers tend to operate in low-margin environments and, as a result, large markets are crucial to their growth and success. With a rapidly growing continent and changing livelihoods, the potential for private sector actors in the FMCG space is promising for 2017 and beyond. McKinsey projects the growth of these consumer-facing industries will surpass $400 billion by 2020. Over the past few years, several African entrepreneurs have started local production using locally-available material in manufacturing soaps, edible oils, household cleaning products, and even school uniforms. From local companies like Del Monte Kenya Limited, Tongaat Hulett, to foreign conglomerates like Unilever and Procter and Gamble, Africa’s FMCG sector has provided plenty of business opportunities, and there are some who say this could be the next “gold rush”. US retail giant Wal-Mart’s recent $2.5 billion dollar investment into South African retailer Massmart points that way. McKinsey have described this sector as the “single-largest business opportunity in Africa”. If figures from the A.T. Kearney 2015 African Retail Development Index (ARDI) are anything to go by, that prediction is accurate. ‘Bottom of the pyramid’ consumers Despite rapid socio-political advancements in Africa, only around half of people there earn more than $4 a day. While in Africa this might be categorised as “middle class”, manufacturers locally and globally would still label them as low-income consumers, or the bottom of the pyramid (BOP) market. The competitive advantage of African owned and run businesses is that, unlike their foreign counterparts, they understand the purchasing decisions of the world’s more than five billion low-income consumers, which gives them a competitive edge. When CK Prahalad’s published The Fortune at the Bottom of the Pyramid, he was speaking directly to the many African entrepreneurs that understood the world’s poor and their untapped buying power. Companies on the continent are learning how to serve these consumers while making money in the process. Single-use and/or low-cost products have been experiencing solid demand. Products like SC Johnson’s individual mosquito coils for $0.01 and returnable 200ml bottles of Coca-Cola continue to be profitable because these companies have invested heavily in the logistics needed to reach BOP consumers, and have carried out market research on the packaging and disposable income required for poorer consumers to be able to buy their products.  African export market Export-led growth has been a successful strategy for several developing economies. Through incentive programmes and policies, African governments and multilateral donors have encouraged exports, which have allowed companies to further diversity their operations and reap the financial benefits. For a long time, the continent was not able to meet global export requirements. However, with the multiplicity of opportunities today – increased market linkages, partnership support, consultation, information sharing and tailored training for export trading – we’ve been able to take advantage of the global demand for African exports. With a growing world population and an imminent danger of global food shortages, Africa is well poised to become the breadbasket of the world. Africa’s exports will be critical to our development as a global society. The continent’s exports will become extremely important in the growth of Africa’s private sector this year and beyond. These four trends have been a long time in the making, but after a slow 2016, it looks like 2017 could be a good year for all those doing business in what is now one of the most exciting and dynamic regions in the world.  The writer is the president and CEO, MeTL Group, Tanzania  Adapted from: https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/01/four-trends-that-will-shape-the-african-business-landscape-in-2017 Please enable JavaScript to view the Comments powered by Disqus.

FCB FCB has hired Brandon Cooke to serve as its new global chief communications officer. The mcgarrybowen veteran replaces Stephen Martincic, who now serves as chief brand and marketing officer for Ascential, owner of the Cannes Lions Festival. "We were looking for someone for this role with the right talent, track record and character to help further fuel the positive momentum that we are experiencing in the network," said FCB worldwide CEO Carter Murray in a statement, adding, "Brandon is all of that and more: He has talent, a great sense of humor and of self, and ambition—and I cannot wait for him to get started." The incoming comms chief's primary responsibility will be promoting the IPG agency's "creative transformation story," which Murray and global chief creative officer Susan Credle have labeled "Never Finished." In a February 2016 Adweek interview, Credle expressed the principle behind that effort as such: "This job of marketing and advertising is never finished, and we must always be evolving, whether it's our thinking on a brand or the way we figure out what we do as an agency." "FCB is a storied agency in the midst of an incredible transformation driven by new talent, new creative firepower and an impressive network offering," Murray's statement read. Cooke spent nearly seven years with the mcgarrybowen organization, most recently leading its new business efforts as global chief marketing officer and playing key roles in the additions of Intel, United Airlines, P&G, Fiat Chrysler and Clorox to its client roster. "[Brandon] has built brands on both the agency and client sides of the business," Murray said of his latest executive hire, "and understands what is needed to help marketers create, define and share their story."

Jeff Chiu AP i By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ and BILL VLASIC New York Times LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Donald Trump won’t be sworn in until Friday but big business has already thrown him a veritable inaugural ball. A series of blue-chip companies, among them Ford, Lockheed Martin, Amazon and Sprint, have all announced plans in recent weeks to hire and invest in the United States. A who’s who of executives from boardrooms here and overseas have made the pilgrimage to Trump Tower and sought the president-elect’s blessing. The near-daily drumbeat of announcements – on Tuesday it was the turn of General Motors and Wal-Mart – is not just about winning good headlines or a favorable mention from the tweeter in chief, however. While the jobs and investments are real enough, all of these corporate behemoths will soon have business before the new administration, with make-or-break moves expected on mergers, trade policy, tax reform, defense contracts and regulation. Signaling to the president-elect and his team that they are on board now also provides chief executives with more leverage down the line. “It might be an attempt to buy goodwill, but I don’t blame them for trying to do that,” said Tom C. Korologos, a longtime Republican strategist and an adviser at the law firm DLA Piper in Washington. “It’s a new administration, and companies are nervous and don’t know what to expect.” Ultimately, the new administration’s decisions will be formulated far from the limelight in conference rooms at federal agencies in Washington or behind closed doors on Capitol Hill. The money riding on the outcome runs into the trillions. And on high-profile issues, the companies will need to make a strong case. Detroit automakers, for example, are concerned that Washington will impose tariffs on cars made in Mexico, but they are eager for wiggle room on new fuel-efficiency standards at home. Wal-Mart is worried about rising trade tensions with China, where many of the products it sells are made. Lockheed Martin, whose chief executive, Marillyn A. Hewson, met with Trump on Friday and promised to create 1,800 new jobs, depends on the government for 20 percent of its $46 billion in revenue. United Technologies, which agreed to preserve 850 jobs at its Carrier unit in Indianapolis after public pressure from Trump, gets about 10 percent of its sales from Washington. On a call with the news media on Tuesday, Trump’s press secretary, Sean Spicer, cited a new pledge by Bayer to invest $8 billion in the United States and create 3,000 jobs. “The reason for this commitment and expansion is because of the president-elect’s focus on creating better business climate here in the United States,” he said. What Spicer didn’t mention is that Bayer, the German chemical giant, faces intense scrutiny from antitrust regulators in Washington and Europe over its plan to buy Monsanto, based in St. Louis, for $57 billion. If Bayer cannot win approval from the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission, it will be costly, with Bayer obligated to pay Monsanto $2 billion under the deal’s terms. Last week, the chief executives of the two companies met with Trump and made their case for the merger, which some advisers to Trump have criticized. Korologos played down the idea that big business would get specific favors in exchange for hiring or investing. But he acknowledged that many of the announcements were choreographed for maximum political impact. “There’s too many hoops to jump through and too many institutions for it to be a simple quid pro quo,” he said. “But what Trump is doing is very unusual, and these decisions weren’t made 48 hours ago or after a tweet. They were in the works for a long time.” Spicer did point out that Bayer’s decision to hire and invest more in the United States had not been disclosed previously – unlike some highly promoted announcements that were essentially recycled versions of previous news releases. In other cases, companies are talking up hiring plans now, after earlier decisions to quietly shed workers. Wal-Mart, the nation’s largest private employer, said Tuesday it would create about 10,000 jobs when it opens about 60 new stores, plans that had already been announced last year. The additions to the workforce are largely in line with Wal-Mart’s typical hiring practices for new stores, according to a company spokesman, Lorenzo Lopez. Months before it announced the new stores last year, Wal-Mart said it could lose as many as 16,000 workers by closing 154 of its U.S. locations and 115 stores overseas. Lopez said “a lot” of the workers who had been affected by the store closures were able to move to surrounding Wal-Mart stores. In the case of the auto industry, Trump’s criticism of imports of Mexican-made vehicles has prompted companies to defend their U.S. manufacturing presence aggressively and announce new investments, some of which had long been in the planning stages. Last week, the chief executive of Fiat Chrysler, Sergio Marchionne, admitted that plans for 2,000 new jobs in the United States had been under consideration long before Trump won the presidency in November. “The decision has been in the works for a long time, dating back to 2015,” Marchionne said during an appearance at the Detroit auto show. “It is just a continuation of the retooling of the U.S. manufacturing base.” But Trump’s immediate – and positive – reaction to the announcement underscored how closely the president-elect is following the automotive job picture, and how his keen interest in U.S. manufacturing is influencing automakers. On Tuesday, General Motors, the largest U.S. automaker, announced $1 billion in new investment in its U.S. factories that would create or retain 1,500 jobs. The automaker also said it was moving production of axles from Mexico to the United States and creating 450 U.S. jobs, and would continue to add thousands of new technology jobs over the next few years. In a statement, GM said the plans had been “in the works for some time.” Yet the timing of the announcement was no coincidence, given Trump’s interest. “There’s no question there is an emphasis on job creation in the U.S. right now,” said Patrick E. Morrissey, a GM spokesman. “This was good timing for us to share what we are doing.” Indeed, on Tuesday, Trump publicly thanked GM and Wal-Mart via Twitter within hours of their announcements. Companies are also closely attuned to where government policy is headed, and want to show they are getting with the program, said Bruce P. Mehlman, founder of Mehlman Castagnetti Rosen & Thomas, a lobbying firm whose clients include Fiat Chrysler, Procter & Gamble and Walmart. “In 2009 and 2010 under President Obama, it was sustainability, and in 2017 with Trump it’s domestic manufacturing,” Mehlman said. For automakers, that is an important issue as GM and many other companies make cars in Mexico for sale in the United States. The automaker has so far declined to stop importing cars from Mexico. But the entire auto industry is bracing for potential changes in the North American Free Trade Agreement that could disrupt their intricate production structure in the United States, Canada and Mexico. Industry analysts see the widely publicized announcements of new jobs as attempts by car companies to both blunt the president-elect’s criticism and curry favor with the incoming Trump administration. “Retaining and growing jobs in the U.S. is a political hot button right now,” said Michael Harley, an analyst with the auto research firm Kelley Blue Book. “The timing of the announcement shows General Motors is more than willing to play the new administration’s publicity game.” Related content LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Business Suggested for you   Comments Videos facebook twitter email Share More Videos 1:25 Protest along Albemarle Rd.
