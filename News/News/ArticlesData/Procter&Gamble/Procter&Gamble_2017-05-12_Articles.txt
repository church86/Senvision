Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 12 May 2017 by Abhishek Budholiya BRICS Study By FMI Growth in the Disposable Hygiene Products Market 2014-2020 The disposable hygiene products market is witnessing an annual growth of nearly 6-7% due to increased consumer spending on personal care products globally. In addition, the demand for improvised comfort, performance and efficient absorbent hygiene products is expected to drive demand for disposable hygiene products in the near future. Concerns for safety, convenience and hygiene are identified as key factors affecting growth of disposable hygiene products market. Furthermore, rising consumption of products such as sanitary pads, wipes, baby products and others across the globe is anticipated to drive demand for disposable hygiene products market in near future. Among the developing economies, increasing population and manufacture of such products in countries such as India and China and low penetration of these products is expected to open opportunities for growth of the market in BRICS. Moreover, industry-sophistication is expected to fuel the demand for disposable hygiene products in Brazil. Request Report Sample@ http://www.futuremarketinsights.com/reports/sample/rep-br-107 Apart from increasing population in BRICS, economic development particularly in countries such as China and India is a key factor contributing towards substantial growth of disposable hygiene products market in the region. Furthermore, increasing disposable income, rising expenditure or consumer spending on personal hygiene and increasing hygiene concerns are expected to fuel demand for disposable hygiene products over the next five to six years. Also, increasing Internet penetration is a prime factor supporting wide distribution of these products to tech-savvy consumers in BRICS via the medium of online retailing. Internet penetration is expected to enhance distribution of these products, leading to increased consumption and brand visibility among consumers in BRICS. Although hygiene concerns rank high among consumers in the BRICS region, low awareness among people in rural areas coupled with low adoption of products in regular operations could hamper growth of the market. However, some international companies are focused on advertising campaigns along with the government awareness campaigns regarding hygiene. Although hygiene concerns in BRICS region is high, low awareness among people in rural areas coupled with low adoption of products on a regular basis is expected to restrict market growth. Moreover, cost reduction coupled with efficient packaging of the disposable hygiene products is concern for companies operating in this market. Request For TOC@ http://www.futuremarketinsights.com/toc/rep-br-107 As a result, a few international companies are focusing on advertising campaigns along with product portfolio expansion through opening of new manufacturing units. For instance, Unicharm Corporation, Procter & Gamble India and Svenska Cellulosa Aktiebolaget SCA (publ.) among others, have opened new manufacturing units for hygiene products in India. For instance, Unicharm Corporation invested US $ 39.2 million to set up a manufacturing facility with the objective to develop baby care, pet care and feminine care products in India. The disposable hygiene products market is segmented on the basis of product type and material used in products. The various disposable hygiene products include nappies, diapers, toilet paper, wipes, sanitary protection, kitchen towels, paper tableware, cotton pads and buds. These products are classified according to age-group since product usage differs accordingly. On the basis of age-group, the market has been segmented into adult care, feminine care and baby care. The materials used in these products are broadly classified as woven or non-woven, which depends on the acceptability of the product as well as age-group for which they are designed. Among all the product categories, the sanitary pads and baby products are collectively expected to be a promising area in the BRICS disposable hygiene products market. Among all the BRICS countries, India and China are expected to witness an increase in demand for disposable hygiene products, followed by Brazil and Russia. Investments by local players for disposable hygiene products are increasing rapidly, which is expected to lead towards a strong competitive database. This in turn is predicted to enhance the competitiveness among local as well as international players, leading to substantial investments in this market in future. Prominent players in this market include Dispowear Sterite Company, Kimberley Clark Corporation, Disposable Hygiene Products Ltd., BOSTIK SA, BAHP, UNICHARM Corporation, Procter & Gamble Company, Unicharm Corporation, Kao Corporation and Svenska Cellulosa Aktiebolaget SCA (publ).

PHOTO: LIM YAOHUI/THE STRAITS TIMES/ASIA NEWS NETWORK SINGAPORE — A Filipino engineer who took upskirt videos of 26 women including his colleague in 2014 was jailed for 10 weeks on Tuesday (May 9) for insulting modesty and having obscene films. Angelo Salvador Afable Beltran, 45, who faced 28 charges, pleaded guilty to eight charges of intruding into the privacy of women by using his cellphone to capture videos of the victims’ inner thighs and underwear at various locations. He also admitted to having 41 digital video clips which were obscene and found at his former residence at Hume Avenue on May 23, 2014. ADVERTISEMENT Now unemployed, he was then working at global consumer goods giant Procter & Gamble International Operations SA Singapore Branch at Singapore Innovation Centre in Biopolis Street. The court heard that a train commuter spotted him standing behind an unknown woman at Jurong East MRT Station platform and taking a video recording of her on May 22, 2014. When the 35-year-old witness confronted him, Beltran panicked and tried to walk away but was stopped. Before the witness could tell the woman what had happened, she had boarded the train. The witness brought Beltran to the MRT station control who called the police. Police came and found other similar videos stored in his phone. Beltran was arrested and brought back to his home in Upper Bukit Timah where several items were seized. Investigation showed that he had used his mobile phone to take upskirt videos of various women wearing short skirts or dresses in 2014. In mitigation, Beltran’s lawyer Patrick Fernandez said during the course of investigation, his client was induced to offer $35,000 to a police officer. Because of this, the matter had been prolonged. He said the officer had been convicted. ADVERTISEMENT Ex-staff sergeant Woo Poh Liang, 29, was given 31 months and four weeks’ jail for corruption and other offenses, fined $20,000 and ordered to pay a penalty of $35,000. Mr Fernandez said Beltran, who has three children, suffered all kinds of mental anguish for the last three years including losing his high-paying expatriate job, and recently, accommodation as well. Beltran’s family had returned to the Philippines and they are “suffering,” he said. As he was desperate to finish his sentence quickly, Mr Fernandez said his client cancelled bail last month so that he could start remand and use it to offset his sentence. “He is absolutely remorseful for his actions,” he added. He told District Judge Samuel Chua that his client was given a warning by the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau in respect of the bribery case. The court backdated his sentence to April 28. Beltran could have been jailed for up to one year and/or fined on each charge of insulting modesty; and for the Films Act offence, fined between $500 and $20,000 and/or jailed for up to six months./rga Subscribe to INQUIRER PLUS to get access to The Philippine Daily Inquirer & other 70+ titles, share up to 5 gadgets, listen to the news, download as early as 4am & share articles on social media.

Occasional constipation is often treated without laxatives. Laxatives are available as OTC drugs without the need of prescriptions. Although laxatives are present in the market for a longer period of time there is insufficient evidence available about the efficacy of laxatives over each other. Adults usually don’t require prescription for consumption of laxatives as they are easily available as OTC drugs. In children laxatives are only advised to be taken through prescription.

(David Paul Morris/Bloomberg News) We’ve long known that e-commerce is creating turmoil in retail, as it gives rise to new start-ups and business models while taking a sledgehammer to old-school brick-and-mortar selling. But it feels lately as if the signs of trouble are piling up at a particularly fast clip. Here’s a look at some of the hints of upheaval we saw this week. Department store disaster. As several major department stores reported quarterly financial results, it was a steady stream of gloom. Kohl’s saw a 2.7 percent decline in comparable sales, a measure of sales at stores open more than a year. Nordstrom saw its store traffic slip, and Macy’s stock got hammered on Thursday after it delivered a startling 5.2 percent drop in comparable sales. Investors punished J.C. Penney, too, for a weak quarter. These companies have a tangle of problems, including waning foot traffic to shopping malls and a customer that is often choosing to spend on experiences instead of goods. Those are big-picture cultural shifts that the long-standing retailers have little ability to control. Where they have more power is in their efforts to fend off the mounting pressure from the likes of fast-fashion players such as H&M and off-price stores such as Marshalls. And there’s little evidence that department stores are doing that well. Nordstrom said there was weakness in the portion of its shoe assortment aimed at younger, more value-oriented customers — exactly the kind of shopper that is probably peeling off for rivals that offer low prices. J.C. Penney said its crucial women’s apparel category was “challenged” this quarter; while Macy’s saw weakness in handbag and costume jewelry sales. There are glimmers of hope if you look hard: Nordstrom, for example, now draws almost a quarter of its total sales online, and sales in that channel are growing robustly. It suggests there is a path forward for the retailer in a digital world. Abercrombie & Fitch is looking for a buyer. It has been years since it first became clear that Abercrombie’s screaming logos and sexed-up imagery were no longer attracting teens’ attention. It has dumped its longtime chief executive and closed stores in pursuit of an as-yet elusive turnaround. This week, as its challenges continue, the apparel chain acknowledged it is exploring a sale. Suitors reportedly include American Eagle Outfitters and Express. If Abercrombie goes under the wing of one of its key rivals, it would emphasize just how dramatically the retail landscape has been reshaped recent months. Walmart has been scooping up e-commerce players such as Moosejaw and Modcloth. Familiar names such as The Limited and American Apparel have closed all of their stores; Payless Shoe Source filed for bankruptcy and pulled out of hundreds of malls. And buckle up, because the retail roller coaster could have more twists ahead: The parent company of Saks Fifth Avenue reportedly is exploring acquiring Macy’s or Neiman Marcus. Grocery behemoth Albertsons may be considering a bid for troubled Whole Foods Market. Rue21 appears to be weighing whether to file for bankruptcy. Gillette makes another run at your mailbox. On Tuesday, the Procter & Gamble-owned shaving behemoth announced a new service it is calling Gillette On Demand, its latest effort to beat back intense competition from upstarts Harry’s and Dollar Shave Club, the e-commerce outposts that sell razors on subscription models. Gillette had previously answered the challenge by launching a subscription service of its own, but now it is trying a different tactic. In addition to subscriptions, it is to offer one-off purchasing. And once customers have used the service initially, they can reorder by texting the word “BLADES” to a certain phone number. The service itself is not exactly a game-changing disruption, but its arrival underscores how urgent the fight is for Gillette. A key P&G rival, Unilever, bought Dollar Shave Club last year and can put serious muscle behind expanding the young brand. The showdown between 110-year-old Gillette and the razor start-ups is symbolic of a broader shift in the industry. Niche players are increasingly pulling dollars away from big retailing monoliths to the tune of $200 billion a year, according to research by Deloitte. Everyone from Macy’s to Campbell Soup is facing similar pressure from boutique-like insurgents, to which customers are flocking for a unique, exclusive vibe. Meanwhile, Gillette’s maneuvers serve as an interesting case study for the wider consumer goods industry. Many brands are currently dabbling in what’s known as a “direct-to-consumer” model, in which they sell through their own branded stores and websites, rather than through general merchandise or department stores. In the digital era, it gives them more control of how their product is distributed, displayed and priced, but it also requires them to add a new competency to their business. If Gillette can do well with a direct-to-consumer model, it might not be long before other familiar drugstore and grocery store brands begin going in the same direction. business business true Please provide a valid email address.

Most Popular Shoppers will spend some $23.6 billion to celebrate Mother's Day this year, a record high, up 10% form last year and equivalent to $186.39 per person. Marketers, of course, are following the money. With campaigns ranging in tone from weepy (American Greetings) to weird (ew, Skittles), brands will likely spend around $2.5 billion on marketing Mother's Day, 5% more than last year, estimated Robert Passikoff, president and founder of Brand Keys, which researches customer loyalty and engagement. "What was once a relatively small, contained holiday has come to cross all ethnic and religious boundaries," Passikoff said. We've highlighted some of the strongest, oddest and most affecting Mother's Day spots this year: eHarmony: Someone For You Part of a larger campaign around single mothers returning to dating. Skittles: Umbilical Possibly Skittles' weirdest effort yet. Brawny: Once a Mother, Always a Giant Brawny used Snapchat Spectacles to see moms through the eyes of their children -- literally. American Greetings: Tattoo A daughter gets a tattoo in remembrance of her deceased mother, underscoring the sadness of the holiday for some. HP: Mother's Day HP continues the effort it began last year of focusing on the emotional power of tangible, printed images. Pampers: Mother's Day Procter & Gamble Co.'s Pampers will wish moms a happy day on behalf of their newborns in an ad by Saatchi & Saatchi running on TV, online and social media from midnight to 5 a.m. on Sunday only. There's no better time to recognize that moms are up when "likely nobody else is," said Andrea Zahumensky, brand director of North America Baby Care.

NEW PRESS RELEASE CATEGORIES ﻿ Health Cold, Cough and Sore Throat Remedies Market to Grow at a CAGR of 3.2% Through 2026 Future Market Insights has announced the addition of the “Cold, Cough and Sore Throat Remedies Market: Global Industry Analysis and Opportunity Assessment 2016-2026" report to their offering.   PR-Inside.com: 2017-05-12 11:59:15 Seeking professional medical help for curing cold, cough or sore throat is become a rare practice, let alone getting admitted in a hospital. Prevalence of cold, cough & sore throat problems through the ages has made people more independent in terms of treating them. In the years to come, effective home remedies will continue to gain traction and people will be taking care of their cold or sore throat through such easy-to-treat remedies. Future Market Insights’ latest report delivers such discernments that are expected to leave a considerable imprint on the global market for cold, cough & sore throat remedies. Based on the report, the global cold, cough & sore throat remedies market is presently valued at US$ 32.4 Bn, and is anticipated to incur sluggish growth at 3.2% CAGR to bring in just over US$ 45.4 Bn by the end of 2026. The report distinctly indicates that rising adoption of self-medication practices and effective home remedies is restraining the market’s overall growth. In the report, titled “Cold, Cough and Sore Throat Remedies Market: Global Industry Analysis and Opportunity Assessment, 2016-2026,” affordability of OTC drugs, rising economic burden of respiratory diseases, availability of medications in variable dosages, and fast & instant relief delivered through such cold, cough & sore throat remedies are driving the market’s growth. Nevertheless, the demand for cold, cough & sore throat remedies is less likely to soar at a healthy rate. Request For Sample@ www.futuremarketinsights.com/reports/sample/rep-gb-1292 Product Recalls & Low Entry of New Players Impacting the Market’s Growth Firstly, the global cold, cough & sore throat remedies market is projected to witness umpteen product recalls. Global leaders in pharmaceuticals industry such as Novartis AG, Pfizer Inc., Bayer AG, GlaxoSmithKline plc., and Reckitt Benckiser Group plc are key players in the global market for cold, cough & sore throat remedies. Despite, there are several newly-launched products that have been recalled after FDA’s censure. Besides, even consumer goods behemoths such as Procter & Gamble Co. and Johnson & Johnson Services Inc. are partaking in the market’s growth. This has resulted in a lowering entry of emerging drugmakers, which has further distorted the market’s growth. Other leading manufacturers of cold, cough & sore throat remedies include AstraZeneca plc, Prestige Brands Inc., and Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. The report highlights how Asia-Pacific excluding Japan (APEJ) region will remain the largest market for cold, cough & sore throat remedies. The region’s proximity to environmental pollution makes its residents more prone to respiratory diseases. With over 30% stake in global revenues, the APEJ cold, cough & sore throat remedies market will global dominate through 2026. North America and Europe will also remain at the forefront, by collectively accounting for nearly half of the global revenues throughout the forecast period. Send An Enquiry@ www.futuremarketinsights.com/askus/rep-gb-1292 The report further reveals that in 2017 and beyond, the demand for antihistamine drugs, expectorants and decongestants will remain considerably high as these revenues from sales of these drugs will showcase growth at more than 3% CAGR. Tablets or pills and nasal drops will also dominate as dosage types, accounting for over 40% share of market value through 2026. The report also predicts retail pharmacies & drug stores as the largest distribution channels for cold, cough & sore throat remedies. Together, these channels will bring in nearly US$ 30 Bn by the end of 2026.

Increasing FDI in e-tailing businesses is further urging manufacturers of men’s grooming products to intensify their distribution operations through online retail channels. Easy accessibility and low costs are key factors for the rising men’s grooming products sales through e-commerce and online retail websites. Over the forecast period, online distribution channels will give rise to an absolute increment of more than US$ 12 billion. Nevertheless, sales of men’s grooming products through supermarkets and independent retail outlets remain key for companies looking to improve their sales potential by catering to impulsive buying and focusing on customer rapport.

Subsequently, men’s grooming products sales under fragrances will account for nearly 35% of the global market over the projected period.

Independently, the company will also be dominant in the overall global men’s grooming products market by accounting for more than 10% market share. However, local manufacturers of men’s grooming products will collectively dominate the global market by accounting for nearly one-third of its market value. Accordingly, acquisition of such native players will be a strategic measure of expanding market presence for global leaders in consumer goods. Johnson & Johnson Private Limited, Koninklijke Philips N.V., ITC Limited, Coty Inc., Unilever PLC., Colgate-Palmolive Company, and Edgewell Personal Care Co., among others, are some leading manufacturers of men’s grooming products that intend to expand their businesses through acquisitions. Furthermore, L’Oréal S.A. and Beiersdorf AG are also some of the recognized players participating in the growth of the global men’s grooming products market.

These efforts come amid warnings by American scientists against these developments before accomplishing the studies and research related to the human microbial environment and its interaction with the skin. Scientists said these developments sound nice, but the proof of benefit is lacking. The issue topped the latest volume of the “Chemistry & Engineering Magazine” issued by the American Chemical Society, the biggest scientific society in the world. The magazine shed lights on projects launched by big and small companies to study the impact of microbes and their efficient factors on the skin health. Despite the lack of information available on the skin-related microbial environment, they focused on the possibility of filling some of these microbes in medicine containers to enhance the role of the ones that give benefit, and fight those that endanger the skin. For example, the Yun Probiotherapy that is now entering the personal care market, incorporates “friendly” bacteria to help correct skin microbe imbalances, while AOBiome Company seeks to develop a product based on the results of a study on horses rolling in the dirt. Those results point to a bacteria found in the dirt that can improve the body’s capacity in regulating inflammation, which will be beneficial for the human body and skin. The magazine also said that companies including Johnson & Johnson, Procter & Gamble, and L’Oréal are developing microbe-based ointments too. Scientists still study the microbiome in the human body. The microbes found in the human body count around 10,000. They weigh around two kilograms on the body of a 100-kg adult. Scientists detected 8 million of microbial protein-coding genes found in the body, 360 times the number of human genes. The American project to study the microbiome spent $157 million between 2008 and 2013, according to the magazine.

May 12, 2017 Kristin Smith Subscribe Conferences & Events Municipal / IC&I Recording data is one thing, but deriving meaningful information from it to provide direction is quite another. Speakers during a session titled “Smart Cities with a Solid (Waste) Plan,” during WasteExpo 2017 in New Orleans shared how their communities are doing just that.   Susan Fife-Ferris, director, solid waste planning and program management at Seattle Public Utlities, shared what the city of 700,000 is doing with its data. She said data doesn’t just come from one source. It is collected by contractors, collectors, processors and an assortment of entities. Within Seattle, private recyclers, composters and transfer stations operate. The city has two transfer stations including one new one. The city conducts research and studies and uses focus groups and stakeholders in its data gathering. One of the struggles Fife-Ferris says Seattle faces is that many people live in the suburbs and come into Seattle for work as well as many people live in Seattle and go to the suburbs to work at places such as Microsoft. This creates a difficulty with consistency across the region, she says. The city has 155,000 residential carts, 4,000 residential Dumpsters, and 6,000 commercial Dumpsters. Recyclables and organics are banned from the Dumpsters. Garbage collected from the city is long hauled to Arlington, Oregon, by rail about 320 miles away. “We only pay for what we ship,” Fife-Ferris said. “The less we ship the less we have to pay so huge economic benefit by not having to ship it.” She defines a “smart city” as one where you “gather data and you use that data to make decisions and drive your policies.” Seattle residents pay $110 for weekly garbage collection, $12 for weekly organics collection and every-other-week recycling collection is free. Fife-Ferris explained, “If you put stuff in your garbage, you are going to pay a lot more.” This rationalization seems to work on residents. Only 2 percent have a 96-gallon container for their trash. Most have smaller containers. Enforcement of correctly recycling is another component of the program. Residents who don’t recycle correctly are given an “Ooops!” tag on their bin to help correct the behavior. “Education and outreach are of huge importance,” Fife-Ferris emphasized. She added that disposal bans also drive programs. “There is a difference between data collection and performance metrics,” she said. “You can learn a lot by mining that data for information.” Phil Bresee, chief of the environmental management office for the Arlington County, Virginia, Solid Waste Bureau, is unique in that almost as many people work in Arlington as live there. He said it also is the smallest county in the country at 26 square miles. Its proximity to the District of Columbia, which it was part of until the 1800s, gives it a highly educated, affluent population. It also has a high ratio of multifamily to single family homes. About three-fifths of the population live in a multifamily dwelling, which has added challenges since the city does not handle the multifamily collection, said Bresee, only regulates it. The county has to rely on regulations to ensure recycling in multifamily dwellings, he said. A recent code change in 2015 forced closer inspection of commercial and multifamily properties which required inspection of individual tenants. The number of audits increased from 1,400 to 4,000. “The inspection didn’t just tell them if they were in compliance or not, but provided key takeaways.” The county realized only 39 percent of tenants were in compliance with the regulations. The most common deficiencies, he said, were not enough bins and employee education and outreach. The county of Arlington does quarterly waste audits of its residential waste streams. During these audits the county noticed its diversion hovered at around 48.8 percent over the last ten years. While that number remained consistent, the amount of municipal solid waste generated has declined by 34 percent. The residential waste stream is about 60,000 tons per year. It also began collecting yard trimmings year-round instead of seasonally which added about 200 tons more yard trimmings to the stream per year. The county switched from producing paper copies of its solid waste and recycling plan to a cloud-based system called Re-TRAC. “We are pretty data driven in Arlington,” said Bresee. “We use all of our data to inform stakeholders.” He said the county surveys its residents and receives about 1,000 surveys per month providing real data to be able to “mine and make program adjustments as we need to.” Jim McKay, general manager, solid waste management services, city of Toronto said, though the two aforementioned areas are different in size from each other and Toronto, many of the challenges are similar. Toronto has a population of 3 million and it is made up of about 50/50 multi- and single-family homes. Commercial and industrial recycling are managed through the private sector. Before recycling diversion was measured by weight, but that does not give an accurate picture, according to McKay. “We are looking at changing how we measure diversion,” says McKay. “We won’t measure it by weight anymore. We are handling more material that weighs less. We are looking at a different set of metrics.” Toronto has a three-cart program and 1.3 million carts in use. It has transfers stations and drop-off locations, which McKay says don’t make sense anymore since less people are driving and relying on public transportation. Toronto is paying to landfill materials so it wasn’t to put as little in the landfill as possible. It is also managing and monitoriing about 160 closed landfills. “We are paying $12 million a year just to maintain those sites,” says McKay. Canada operates a little bit differently than the U.S. because it has extended producer responsibility where the manufacturers and distributers responsible for a portion of the costs of recycling. It provides an extra revenue stream to the city. The city has a curbside green bin and does biweekly garbage pickups. The list of organics the city accepts is quite extensive because of the flexibility of the two anaerobic digestion systems it has. “When you switch to biweeky pickups it is that much more incentive to divert more material,” he said.   The biggest change coming down the pipe for Canada is in provincial policy. Over the next several years EPR will go from paying 50 percent of the cost of recycling to 100 percent of the cost. The consumer goods companies have agreed to this plan as long as they can take control of the recycling system. It will be run by an organization made up of companies like Proctor & Gamble and Coca-Cola. McKay said Toronto has an aspirational goal of zero waste. “We are trying to shift away from zero-waste and more toward a circular economy concept,” he said. The city is also moving to mobile depots for recycling and bringing services to a high rise complex, for example. Textile recycling is another area the city is looking at as with its robust organics recycling program, textiles are a larger part of the waste stream. One of the challenges of Toronto is its urban density and it is looking at a “more condensed solution than all these bins,” said McKay. It also wants to reap the benefits of the two digesters that’s gas is being flared currently in what McKay calls an “unbelievable waste of a resource.” WasteExpo 2017 was May 8-11 at the Ernest N.

A provision shop in Bandung, Indonesia offering a variety of items packaged in plastic sachets. Resource-efficient to produce and affordable for consumers, plastic sachets have nevertheless become an environmental nuisance. Image: Ikhlasul Amal, CC BY-NC 2.0 By Hannah Koh Friday 12 May 2017 Share this story From shampoo and toothpaste to detergent powder and instant coffee, plastic sachets are a common form of packaging in developing countries that have made household goods affordable for people with limited disposable income. But with hundreds of billions of them thrown away every year, these lightweight plastic sachets have become an environmental nuisance, clogging drains and polluting public spaces. To tackle this problem and close the loop on its sachet production, consumer goods giant Unilever yesterday announced that it has developed new technology to recycle used sachets and will make the technology available to peers and rivals. Called the CreaSolv Process, the technology was jointly developed by Unilever and the Fraunhofer Institute for Process Engineering and Packaging IVV, a German firm specialising in packaging. Amita Chaudhury, sustainable business director for Southeast Asia and Australasia, Unilever, told Eco-Business that the technology enables the company to recycle every part of a used sachet. “The sachets that are recycled through our plant will be 100 per cent recycled into another generation of plastic sachets, and the residue film can be used in creating other products, like plastic pallets.” Unilever will test the commercial viability of CreaSolv by opening a pilot plant in East Java by end 2017. “Indonesia is one of the most critical markets in terms of sachets infiltrating ocean waste. It is also our biggest sachet market, and is a natural choice for us to locate the plant,” she said. Close to one-third of all plastic manufactured ends up in the ocean, and Indonesia is the world’s second largest plastic polluter after China. Chaudhury said that single-use sachets make quality brands affordable for people in markets such as Indonesia. But there is little financial incentive for companies to recovery or recycle such small individual amounts of plastic. But the CreaSolv Process uses the same amount of energy used to produce 1 kilogram of virgin plastic to recover 6 kilograms of pure plastic polymer, according to Dr Andreas Mäurer, department head of plastic recycling at Fraunhofer IVV comment in a statement.    Within the CreaSolv process, the focus is on extracting the polyethylene plastic that constitutes 60 per cent of plastic sachets. The used sachets are shredded and mixed with a solvent. The mixture is then turned into a sludge and the solvent evaporated, and the resulting material made into polyethylene pellets identical to ones made of virgin material. Pellets can then reenter the production cycle to be made into new plastic film. The byproduct of the film can also be channelled into the production of other items. Unilever, which owns brands including Dove soap and Knorr soups, is also working on establishing a waste collection scheme to collect the sachets, and is partnering with waste banks, retailers and the local authorities to do so. Unilever will also work with waste pickers, who form an important but informal part of waste management systems in Indonesia. This is not the consumer goods giant’s first attempt to recycle plastic packaging. It has partnered Walmart for a recovery programme that gave people Unilever vouchers in exchange for their sachets in India, and in the Philippines offered text messaging credits in exchange for used plastic. Unilever has experimented with the use of sachets in fuel generation and cement production. Earlier this year, the company pledged that all its plastic packaging would be reusable, recyclable or compostable by 2025. There is a “clear economic case” for more circular production processes, Chaudhury said. She pointed to research that has found that 95 per cent of the value of plastic packaging is lost after its first use, which totals some $80-$120 billion. “This creates huge economic inefficiencies for our industry. We believe that our commitment to making 100 per cent of our packaging recyclable will support the long-term growth of our business,” she said. CreaSolv is expected to help Unilever reduce the cost of packaging, she added. Other multinationals have also made progress in recovering and recycling plastic waste. Unilever’s big rival Procter & Gamble announced it was making the world’s first recyclable shampoo bottle out of beach plastic in January 2017, and Adidas is putting its best foot forward with a line of sports shoes made from ocean waste. By making the CreaSolv technology open source, Unilever hopes to “scale the technology with industry partners”, said David Blanchard, chief research and development officer, Unilever, in a statement. Asked how Unilever benefited from sharing the technology, Chaudhury said: “At Unilever, we believe innovation is great, but when we can innovate to make a positive impact on the environment, like limiting plastic pollution, we have an obligation to share it. “Our products will speak for themselves, but our future can only be secured if we work together.” Share this story Topics Carbon & Climate CSR Lifestyle Manufacturing Waste Regions Asia Pacific Global Indonesia Tags circular economy conservation consumer products economy industrial waste marine packaging plastic pollution recycling sustainable development waste Advertisement Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. blog comments powered by Disqus Advertisement Most popular Energy Indonesia to build 'world's largest' tidal power plant Indonesia to build 'world's largest' tidal power plant Food & Agriculture Exploding watermelons and fake fish: Transforming agriculture through blockchain technology Exploding watermelons and fake fish: Transforming agriculture through blockchain technology Policy & Finance Why India and China are driving the 'global green shift' Why India and China are driving the 'global green shift' View all news Industry Spotlight Energy Storage to solve Australia's energy woes Storage to solve Australia's energy woes Energy Grid unlocked: Consumers are driving Asia’s energy revolution Grid unlocked: Consumers are driving Asia’s energy revolution Energy Will India’s renewable energy dreams come true?

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 12 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Vasomotor Symptoms of Menopause Market is Driven by Increasing Awareness among Female Patients Regarding their Health and use of Non-Hormonal Therapies Menopause is the stage during which women stop producing ovaries and there is an end of the fertile phase. It occurs in 85% of premenopausal women during their late 40s, resulting in the cessation of their menstrual cycle. Due to the cessation of menstrual flow, the production of estrogen decreases and gonadotropin increases, which gives rise to various physiological and psychological changes, called vasomotor symptoms. Obtain Report Details @ www.transparencymarketresearch.com/vasomotor-symptoms-men… Vasomotor symptoms of menopause are the actions which are related to nerves and muscles that cause the blood vessels to dilate. Vasomotor symptoms of menopause are basically a transition between two phases: perimenopause and menopause. The major vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause are listed below: Hot flashes: Hot flash is one of the most frequent symptoms of menopause. During this condition, women feel enormous intensity of heat accompanied with excessive sweating. Hot flashes with sweating also occur at night and the condition is termed as night sweats which disturbs the sleep pattern of an individual. Formication: Formication is basically a form of paresthesia which results in an abnormal skin sensation, illusion or hallucination that some insects are crawling over the skin. It causes feelings of itchiness, tingling or even burning on the skin. Migraine: Due to the hormonal fluctuations of menstrual cycle, migraine headaches pose a serious impediment to women undergoing menopausal phase. They are a form of recurrent headaches that can last from few hours up to three days. Dysfunctional uterine bleeding: Due to abrupt changes in hormonal levels, ovulation becomes inconsistent causing endometrial hyperplasia to develop and result in abnormal bleeding. Psychological symptoms: There are a number of psychological symptoms associated with onset of menopause such as fatigue, anxiety, irritability, mood swings, insomnia etc. Global Vasomotor Symptoms of Menopause Market: Segmentation There are various therapies related to vasomotor symptoms of menopause and henceforth the market can be segmented as follows: Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT): HRT is a hormone therapy which is given to women whose estrogen and progesterone hormone level have dropped enormously Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERM): SERMs are a type of drugs that block the effect of estrogen in the breast cells and activate the action of estrogen in other cells such as uterine cells Gabapentin: They are a type of medications which reduces the effect of hot flash and night sweats Antidepressants: Few vasomotor symptoms are relieved with the aid of antidepressants. Example: fluoxetine and venlafaxine. The driving factors that will augment the growth of menopausal symptoms therapeutics market are introduction of new treatments and therapies in the market, increasing awareness among female patients about their health and use of non-hormonal therapies. Make an Enquiry @ www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag… Global Vasomotor Symptoms of Menopause Market: Geographical Dynamics Geographically, North America dominates the menopause therapeutics market followed by Europe. According to NutritionMD, about 40% of North American women seek treatment for menopausal symptoms. Increasing cases of menopausal symptoms and the rising need of women population to go for novel therapies are the major factors, which have driven the growth of the menopausal symptoms therapeutic market. Asia-Pacific is one of the most rapidly developing region and the prime factors that will drive the growth of menopausal symptoms therapeutics market in this region are increasing geriatric female population with menopause disorders, and a shift in preference from hormonal therapies to non-hormonal therapies that will create an opportunity for many pharmaceutical companies to develop novel technologies and therapies. Global Vasomotor Symptoms of Menopause Market: Company Profiles Some of the top market players of this market are Eli Lilly and Company. Procter & Gamble, Pfizer Inc., Ausio harmaceuticals, LLC, EndoCeutics, Inc., Edgemont Pharmaceuticals, LLC and many others.
