A Pepperidge Farm endcap display in a grocery store.  Credit: Rabbit57i_Flicker Most Popular Procter & Gamble lit a brushfire in digital advertising this year when it said it was done paying for ads it couldn't prove were served on-screen. "The days of giving digital a pass are over," P&G Chief Brand Officer Marc Pritchard said. But another medium with a huge share of marketers' money has a "viewability" problem of its own: Corrugated paper displays in stores. Promotional displays make it out of back rooms and onto display floors -- let's call it "in view" -- less than half the time that they're supposed to, recent studies have found. Unviewable ads IRL are a huge cost. P&G alone spends around $1 billion annually just on corrugated displays around the world, people familiar with the matter said. Last month P&G pegged potential savings from eliminating waste from promotional materials of all sorts, which includes these displays, $500 million annually within five years. That compares to $1 billion in planned savings from media buying and $500 million from agency and production fees. Quri, a retail intelligence company that pays 500,000 people to use their phones to take pictures of store displays, finds compliance rates around promotional plans average around 43%, said CEO David Gottlieb. Another study last year by Shelfbucks, which sensors in stores and RFID chips into cardboard displays to track how they're deployed, found displays were on the sales floor at the start of scheduled promotions only 46% of the time. The study involved 21 brands owned by major marketers including P&G, Unilever, Mondelez and Kraft Heinz. Better compliance with promotion plans could improve sales lift by 30% to 45% Shelfbucks estimated. But another firm that wasn't selling solutions, or expecting to find them a major factor, also found similar results. In a study for an undisclosed marketer in late 2015, Cadent Consulting found that its brands' shelf presence beyond their regular slots were visible 66% of the time, but the corrugated or other shopper-marketing materials intended to go with them were only present 43% of the time, said Managing Partner Don Stuart. "Compliance had a bigger impact on ROI than any other factor," Stuart said. Quri said it has national coverage now as well as a handful of clients, though it declined to name them. A former top P&G sales executive sits on the advisory board. Shelfbucks is in only 300 stores now but said it has signed a deal with a major national retailer that will add thousands more stores by year end, with plans to eventually cover 35,000 at the seven leading national retailers. Cadent's bi-annual survey earlier this year found manufacturer plans for shopper-marketing spending leveling off for the first time ever, and spending plans declining for a broader array of retailer promotions. Concern about whether retailers, brokers or other third parties are really following through on plans may be part of what's driving those intentions, he said. But he also doesn't expect marketers can follow through on their cutbacks. "It was a fairly dismal first quarter for most manufacturers and retailers," Stuart said. "As a result, I think there's going to be back-half catch-up. That means manufacturers are going to be spending aggressively, and retailers are going to be looking for that money."

Driven by on-demand labour platforms and online work management solutions, digital technology is giving rise to talent marketplaces that are sweeping aside the old hierarchical management structures. Becoming an on-demand enterprise is key to being able to deliver rapid innovation and organisational change to truly transform into digital businesses for the twenty-first century. Read More Insider to host inaugural SME Conference In this talent marketplace, businesses can bring together the skills they need into ad hoc teams, to accomplish specific goals, then release them back into the talent pool to tackle another challenge. That may not appear daunting to a new or start-up company. WordPress parent company Automattic has 450 staff spanning 45 different countries and business is done based on project teams ranging from two to 12 workers. But new technology companies aren’t the only ones reinventing the traditional approach to the workforce. Procter & Gamble, established some 180 years ago, is experimenting with on-demand talent marketplaces as a means to augment its own workforce, using Upwork Enterprise. So far, products from this pilot programme were delivered faster and at a lower cost than with conventional methods 60 per cent of the time. Labour platforms like Upwork allow for teams of internal employees and freelancers with the right skills to be quickly assembled to complete projects and then dispersed when the job is done. It is a much needed talent revolution when you consider that 73 per cent of executives questioned in a recent Accenture survey reported that corporate bureaucracies are stifling productivity and innovation. The companies that are flourishing are those that are leveraging technology solutions that address the talent problem: efficiently matching the supply and demand for people and skills in a highly personalised way. In a similar vein, large companies like MasterCard, Airbus and World Bank have used Gigster’s AI-driven platform for their high end talent of software developers and project managers. Companies can spin up new agile design and development programmes in just weeks, if not days, compared to the traditional model that takes months of planning, budgeting, sourcing and launching. Companies that use online work management solutions are able to leverage both internal and external workers, fill a talent gap, jump start new projects and respond to market changes. Read More Build-up to the Scottish Accountancy & Finance Awards: Finalists in Restructuring Team of the Year The supply of available, skilled freelance workers is already steady and growing, making on-demand labour not just possible but also ideal to quickly augment a company’s workforce. Instead of a traditional structure where individuals are hired for a single position and engaged in fixed business functions, a marketplace-like approach will support people being dynamically teamed together on-demand from project to project, based on skills, knowledge and staffing needs. But there are consequences. Companies are also fundamentally rewriting the social contract – reshaping the view on the relationships and responsibilities that employers, government and society have with their workers. Who provides worker training for non-traditional employees? Who pays for benefits if someone is a fluid worker, moving between different companies? If freelance workers are between assignments are they unemployed? At Accenture, we are exploring the future of engaging on-demand workers who take on project-based work while earning credits towards training and benefits. It is going to be crucial that frameworks are created that provide the flexibility to scale the current and emerging worker relationships, while optimising the related mix of compensation, benefits, training and community engagement. The nature of work and social contracts are in flux in economies around the world. What is imperative is that we stop thinking about people working for companies and start making companies work for people. Already we are seeing a ‘liquid workforce’. This is where in response to constant disruption and fast-shifting business goals, forward-thinking enterprises are reimagining their workforce and no one person spends their entire careers doing the same job, suing the same skills. Providing constant training that gives employees the skills they need to adapt and thrive and organising them into teams around projects, is becoming a competitive advantage. Accenture estimates that as we look five years ahead is that in addition presumptive judgements around full-time employment and freelancers is likely to flip completely. Compared to traditional full-time employment, talent marketplaces will provide workers with improved earning opportunities, more rewarding work, secure benefits and respected credentials. In response, the business structures of the dominant companies will be based on small cores and powerful ecosystems, while the on-demand labour platforms will be the primary drivers of economic growth in both the developed and emerging economies worldwide.

Mr Sy's SM Investments Corp. is counting on logistics affiliate 2GO Group to fuel earnings growth as e-commerce and economic growth boosts demand for deliveries, chief executive officer Ricky DyBuncio, 57, said in an interview. Logistics may even become the company's fourth business pillar after banking, real estate and retail, he said. The logistics company's shares surged to a record Tuesday in Manila trading. "As economic growth spreads nationwide, you will see a more and more increasing need for logistics operations," Mr DyBuncio, the first person from outside the Sy family to lead SM Investments, said in Manila May 25. "It definitely could grow by double digits for many, many years to come." SM Investments, the country's most valuable company after Sy-controlled residential and malls builder SM Prime Holdings, has said it needs to expand in high-growth sectors to complement its main businesses. Investments in logistics will help boost earnings as the core businesses reach a scale that makes double-digit percentage growth no longer the norm, Mr DyBuncio said. SM stands for Shoemart, the name of the original store Mr Sy opened in 1958. Get The Straits Times newsletters in your inbox Sign Up Mr DyBuncio, who took over from the founder's son Harley Sy last month, has said he'll look to the company's share price as a measure of his performance. He will need fast-growing businesses to continue driving the stock higher as his predecessor oversaw a more than a six-fold increase since the shares began trading in 2005. Logistics can grow at least two times faster than the economy, according to Mr DyBuncio, who has been looking at investment opportunities in logistics over the past two years. Economic growth is boosting demand for shipping, warehouses and port facilities nationwide. Shares of 2GO climbed as much as 21 per cent to 25 pesos, the highest since the company's 1995 listing, before paring gains to trade at 23.40 pesos as of the midday trading break in Manila on Tuesday. The stock has tripled so far this year. SM Investments fell 0.2 percent to 775.50 pesos. The Philippines plans to spend as much as 9 trillion pesos (S$249.1 billion) on infrastructure from this year to 2022 to boost Southeast Asia's fastest growing economy. The economy grew 6.4 per cent in the first quarter, its weakest expansion in six quarters and is forecast to grow 6.6 per cent this year, according to economist estimates compiled by Bloomberg. "You can't have faster economic growth without logistics," said Gonzalo Bongolan, vice president at Philippine Commercial Capital Inc., a Manila-based investment bank. "Logistics and the last mile of distribution will become more critical as commercial activities multiply." 2GO is the largest provider of so-called end-to-end logistics services in the Philippines, a nation of more than 7,000 islands. The company, which has a fleet of 24 ships, had a 90 percent passenger market share and cornered 38 percent of cargo that passed through the ports where it operated. Customers include SM Investments' department stores and grocers, Procter & Gamble, and Lazada Group, a Southeast Asian e-commerce operator whose Philippine clients include an SM's online store. Net income will jump about 14 per cent this year to 35.4 billion pesos, based on the average of seven analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. That would be the fastest growth since the 16 percent advance in 2012. SM Investments indirectly owns about 30 per cent of 2GO. It's part of portfolio investments amassed to diversify beyond core businesses that include BDO Unibank Inc., the biggest Philippine lender by assets, and China Banking Corp. SM Investments' two other major units are SM Prime, the nation's largest shopping mall operator, and SM Retail Inc., the biggest Philippine retailer with 2,303 outlets. Return on equity, which fell to about 11 percent last year from the 14.3 percent peak in 2012, will rebound in the next couple of years as returns from its investments, including property assets, improve, DyBuncio said. As for the logistics business, DyBuncio said he's still not certain it will become a core business on the scale of the banking, property and retail mainstays. "Is it going to be big enough that we can say it's a fourth leg? We need to see what happens in the next few years," DyBuncio said. "We might be able to find the fourth leg but it will probably be a short leg given the size of the group's three core businesses."

The study, titled “1-Decanol Market – Global Industry Analysis, Size, Share, Growth, Trends, and Forecast 2016 – 2024”, is available for sale on the firm’s website. The molecular formula of 1-decanol is C10H22O. 1-Decanol is a derivative of oil or natural fat. It is prepared by hydrogenation reaction of decanoic acid. The IUPAC name of 1-Decanol is Dec-1-ol. It has an aromatic odor, density of 0.8297 g/cm3 and boiling point 232.90C. 1-Decanol belongs to a group of long chain aliphatic alcohols within a carbon chain length of C6-24. It possesses solubilizing or emulsifying properties, and can be used as anti-spalling agent in concrete. It is an excellent lubricating agent. 1-Decanol is also used as antifoam and raw material for natural based wetting agents. It is a colorless liquid substance, which is inflammable. Browse Market Research Report @ www.transparencymarketresearch.com/1-decanol-market.html 1-Decanol is readily biodegradable and therefore degrades in the environment. The biodegradability of 1-Decanol is expected to boost its usage in personal care and polymer processing applications. However, it is acutely toxic and therefore is harmful for aquatic life. When accumulated in large quantities, it may cause death of aquatic organisms. It causes mild skin irritation when exposed in large quantities to skin. 1-Decanol is also used in cleaning agents and coatings; however, the concentration of 1-decanol is generally low in cleaning agents. The other names of 1- Decanol are Decyl Alcohol; n-Decanol; primary Decyl Alcohol; Decylic Alcohol; n- Decyl Alcohol; Capric Alcohol; and Alcohol C-10. The market for 1-Decanol can be segmented based on end-use applications into plasticizers, lubricants, surfactants, cleaning agents, personal care, and pharmaceutical. It is used as penetration enhancer in transdermal drug delivery in the pharmaceutical industry because of its ability to permeate the skin. It is used as aluminum rolling lubricants, lubricant oil additives, and plastic lubricants in the lubricants industry. 1-Decanol is extensively used in lotions, creams, and conditioners in the personal care industry. In terms of region, the 1-Decanol market can be segregated into Asia Pacific, North America, Latin America, Middle East & Africa, and Europe. The global market for 1-Decanol is expected to expand. Asia Pacific is anticipated to be the dominant region due to the high demand for personal care products. China and India are likely to be the prominent consumers of 1-Decanol in Asia Pacific due to presence of established end-user industries in these countries. Growth in the polymer processing industry in Asia Pacific and North America is also estimated to propel the demand for 1-Decanol. The 1-Decanol market in North America and Europe is expected to expand, led by the increase in demand for beauty products in these regions. Key players operating in the 1-Decanol market are P&G Chemicals, Sasol, BASF SE, Thai Fatty Alcohol, Kao, Muslim Mas, and Emery Oleochemicals.

Is your creative agency killing your campaign? If your campaign is a flop, your ad creative might not be the problem. Instead, it's time to take a hard look at your agency, says contributor Geoff Gurevich. Geoff Gurevich on May 29, 2017 at 11:00 am More Let’s talk about your creative agency — the team of marketing gurus who take all the messy, disjointed advantages about your company that you provide them with and turn it all into a polished campaign. They did a SWOT analysis, the pitch is polished, and you spent exorbitant amounts of your marketing budget to get their campaign in front of your market. Then, the seemingly impossible happens: crickets. Was it the creative itself or something else? Let’s explore the possibilities. The creative may not be the issue One of the biggest mistakes your agency is probably making is believing you. While you prefer to think that your agency is in the business of getting you great results, that’s actually their secondary goal. Their first goal is keeping the agency in business — a goal which requires making clients like you happy. It’s the reason you’re assigned an account manager whose only job is to refine how the rest of the team’s jargon is conveyed to you, their client. This relationship creates a conflict of interest for your business. They listen to your concerns and provide elegant solutions — but in many cases, these concerns are based on gut feelings rather than hard data or research to identify the real issues your company is struggling with. Many times, upper management is too close to the business to understand the way the market views their company (their positioning). Their anecdotal insight is valuable, but researching the needs of your company’s target market is often more critical to success. Creative agencies that typically work with large brands are in the habit of testing concepts with focus groups before releasing final work to the masses. Yet, the majority of agencies don’t place enough importance on the research that would land them on the right trajectory to begin with. There are certainly exceptions. There are quite a few creative agencies that are diligent in this area, but the majority either glaze over this process or fail to connect their concepts to the findings. Can an agency be creative and analytical? Today’s creative agencies are spending less time pitching themselves as the boutique or traditional advertising experts they started as, instead adopting a “full-service” approach. The problem lies in the fact that most agencies do not excel in all areas of marketing, and many are adopting digital because they have to. All too often, services that are outside of the agency’s core competency are outsourced and white-labeled without the client ever knowing. So, the creative agency you just hired to run your entire marketing portfolio is likely outsourcing management of the distribution channels that give their content the runway to succeed. The result is an inherent disconnect to what your account manager can communicate back to you, with intelligence, regarding the inner-workings of your campaigns. If your pay-per-click advertising is weakly executed or your SEO efforts are minimal or misguided, you may go months or years without knowing that these factors are killing your success, not the creative itself. Your results now heavily rely on their background “partner,” who you likely did not take the same care to vet, or worse yet, are not even aware of. But you wanted to hire a single point of accountability Some of the largest organizations in existence (Sears, Procter & Gamble, Kraft) still prefer to maintain a healthy mix of true boutique agencies to handle their areas of expertise separately. One agency may be responsible for all digital creative production, while another agency places and manages the media. For example, a dedicated digital marketing agency is probably better suited to build, manage and optimize paid search or display campaigns than a traditional marketing agency that offers digital services. The same is true of a digital agency offering printing services or traditional media placement. In most cases, it just makes sense to utilize firms in the areas that they are truly experts. Instead of blindly taking on an entire marketing portfolio management scope with an agency that presented well in one area, take the time to discuss each channel in-depth and understand their strategy. What methodology will they use to conduct research, create concepts, place media and assess results? Try to gain an understanding of what your prospective agency handles internally versus what they outsource. If they outsource or partner with another agency, chat with them directly and find out who your point of contact will be throughout the engagement. After having these discussions, you’ll be in a stronger position to decide whether the agency you are considering can handle it all, or whether they’re stretching their capabilities on your campaign.
