Riva Hasan Doğan Milli Takımlar Kamp ve Eğitim Merkezleri'nde imzalanan anlaşmaya göre P&G, Gilette markasıyla A Milli Erkek Futbol Takımı'na, Ariel markasıyla da A Milli Kadın Futbol Takımı'na sponsor oldu. P&G ayrıca Hasan Doğan Milli Takımlar Kamp ve Eğitim Merkezleri'nin de malzeme tedarik sponsoru oldu. Türkiye Futbol Federasyonu ile P&G (Procter & Gamble) arasında sponsorluk anlaşması imzalandı.

Spor yatırımlarımızı arttırmanın adımını atacağız. Olimpiyatlar'ın resmi sponsorlarından birisiyiz. 2014 yılından bu yana TMOK'la birlikte Olimpik Anneler projesine destek olduk. 30 sporcuya Tokyo Olimpiyatlar'ı öncesinde hem kendilerine hem annelerine destek olduk. Bugün ilk kez futbol alanında bir anlaşmaya imza atıyoruz. Gilette, 1911 yılından bu yana ilk sponsorlukları yapan marka oldu. Brezilya Milli Takımı'yla bir sponsorluk vardı, bugün bir ikincisi Türkiye Milli Takımı'yla olacak" diye konuştu. "14 yıl sonra yeniden sponsor oluyoruz" 2003 yılında Orkid markasıyla Türkiye Kadın Voleybol Takımı'na sponsor olduklarını ve o sene düzenlenen Avrupa Voleybol Şampiyonası'nda Türk Milli Takımı'nın çok başarılı olduğunu söyleyen Turnaoğlu, "Kadınların hayata her zaman daha fazla katılımını sağlamak için çalışıyoruz. 14 yıl sonra bu kez Ariel'le Kadın Milli Futbol Takımı'na sponsor oluyoruz. İnanııyorum ki hem erkek, hem kadın futbol takımı büyük başarılara imza atacaklar. P&G olarak spora yatırımı, geleceğe yatırım olarak görüyoruz.

Bu anlaşmaların Milli Takımımız'ın Rusya'daki 2018 Dünya Kupası'na katılırken itici güç olacağına eminim. Geçen hafta Türkiye'nin yanı sıra Danimarka, İngiltere, Almanya, İspanya ve Polonya'da 13 ve üstü yaştaki kızlar üzerinde yapılan araştırmaya göre, futbolun ilgi alanı olarak 1 numara olduğu ortaya çıktı. 2021 yılında UEFA, futbolun kadınlar arasında 1 numaralı spor olmasını bekliyor. Gücümüze güç katan tüm sponsorlarımıza şükranlarımızı sunuyorum. Türkiye ve dünyanın önemli markalarıyla çalışmalarımız devam edecektir. P&G'nin 30. yılını da bu vesileyle tekrar kutluyorum" dedi. Açıklamaların ardından taraflar sponsorluk anlaşmasını imzaladı. Anlaşmanın imzalanmasıyla birlikte, toplu fotoğraf çekimi yapıldı.

The companies argued that the change violates the U.S. Constitution and the Multistate Tax Compact, a 50-year-old agreement among states for dividing the taxes owed by companies that do business in multiple jurisdictions. The Supreme Court rejected the appeals without comment. Justice Samuel Alito didn’t participate in the cases. Michigan state courts upheld the change, which was enacted through laws passed in 2007 and 2014. The first measure laid out a new formula for multistate companies to use in calculating their taxes, effective Jan. 1, 2008. After the Michigan Supreme Court said companies could still use a different formula authorized by the Multistate Tax Compact, the state passed the 2014 law, which explicitly repealed that approach. The new measure applied retroactively to 2008. The appeals argued that the Multistate Tax Compact is a contract, binding on the states that signed it. The companies also contended that the retroactive liability violated the Constitution’s due-process clause because the change upset settled expectations. The companies that pressed the appeals also included Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., Aetna Inc.’s Coventry unit, AT&T Inc.’s DirecTV unit, and the law firm Skadden Arps. Michigan officials urged the Supreme Court not to hear the appeals, saying the 2014 measure merely clarified what the 2007 law intended. The cases are Sonoco v. Michigan Department of Treasury, 16-687; Skadden Arps v. Michigan Department of Treasury, 16-688; Gillette v. Michigan Department of Treasury, 16-697; IBM v. Michigan Department of Treasury, 16-698; Goodyear v. Michigan Department of Treasury, 16-699; and DirecTV v. Michigan Department of Treasury, 16-736. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

"As trademark professionals, we too must evolve," he said, urging everyone to move from being a technical trademark practitioner to becoming a steward of the brand. To illustrate this, Ferretti described the history of branding from the 19th century (when the focus of differentiation was functional) through the 20th century, when companies such as Procter & Gamble communicated their brand message to consumers through television content and into in the late 1980s when social issues made brand owners become conscious of their corporate social responsibility. Today, social media has changed branding again. But brand owners and their managers are still learning how to navigate this change and must "actively listen to consumers" and allow them to lead the conversation. He urged brand owners to take bold steps to give consumers control. "Put them in the driver’s seat," Ferretti said, reassuring the audience that many brands have succeeded by taking this approach. Doing so, you will end up having consumers as your brand ambassadors who will help communicate the positive authentic brand message you want to deliver. Ferretti concluded by advising trademark practitioners to understand the DNA of the brand and make sure promises made to consumers are delivered. Do so and you can navigate your brands to a successful future. Earlier at the ceremony INTA Chief Executive Etienne Sanz de Acedo said there are 10,600 attendees this year, with 2,400 newcomers and more than 8,000 repeat attendees. Spain’s education and culture minister Íñigo Méndez de Vigo gave the keynote speech. Comments   0 Print Close Display this name Please enter your name... Please enter your name...

Tillerson is the former CEO of ExxonMobil. By Julia Horowitz NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- With the Trump budget about to drop, business leaders have a message for Secretary of State Rex Tillerson: State Department funding equals jobs. A letter sent to Tillerson on Monday that signed by 225 executives argues that a robust budget for the State Department and U.S. development agencies helps American companies who do business abroad and supports jobs back home. Companies that signed on to the letter include Walmart, Pfizer, Coca-Cola, DuPont, Mars, Procter & Gamble and Nike. "With 95 percent of the world's consumers outside the United States and many of the fastest growing economies in the developing world, now is the time to double down on America's global economic leadership," the letter reads. The Trump administration will reveal its full budget for fiscal 2018 on Tuesday. In a "skinny" budget unveiled in March, the State Department saw its funds slashed 28.7%. The letter puts America's diplomatic interests in starkly corporate terms. It's a clear effort to appeal to a secretary of state who was a career oil executive, as well as to an "America First" president who has made domestic job creation his cornerstone issue. It makes the case that foreign engagement is as much about opening up new markets as it is about promoting democratic institutions. "Our embassies and consulates around the world are essential partners for American businesses to ensure we can compete on a level playing field," the letter says. Foreign aid, meanwhile, will help the U.S. tamp down its trade deficit. "Eleven of America's top fifteen export markets are in countries that have been recipients of U.S. foreign assistance," it reads. The overture also notes that "economic freedom, prosperity, and entrepreneurship" can mitigate the spread of "violent extremism." The Trump administration's proposed State Department cuts were met with bipartisan backlash shortly after they were announced. A corps of retired military generals has been making the rounds on Capitol Hill, asking lawmakers to preserve funding for diplomacy. The initial proposal reduces funding for the World Bank, the United Nations and climate change programs. It also calls for "reorganization and consolidation" within the department. Several State Department officials have also told CNN that Tillerson is considering trimming between 2,300 and 2,500 employees. TM & © 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Its investment is going to the Closed Loop Fund, a $100 million social impact investment fund committed to funding comprehensive recycling infrastructure and programs in cities across the US. Nestlé Waters joins the ranks of companies like 3M, Coca-Cola, Colgate-Palmolive, Goldman Sachs, Johnson & Johnson, Keurig Green Mountain, PepsiCo and the PespiCo Foundation, Procter & Gamble, Unilever, Walmart, and the Walmart Foundation. The so-called recycling gap refers to the fact that, while 75% of the waste stream in the US is recyclable, just 30% actually gets recycled. In 2015, businesses and municipalities in the US spent over $5 billion disposing of waste in landfills. Much of this waste, such as PET plastic, is in demand among manufacturers as raw material for everything from textiles to packaging. In fact, major CPGs, in hoping to improve their recycled plastic packaging, can’t get their hands on enough recycled plastic, the NY Times reported when the Closed Loop Fund kicked off in 2015. The problem is the infrastructure: most recycling facilities aren’t able to collect, sort and process plastics and still turn a profit, according to the article. Nestle Waters’ chief sustainability officer Nelson Switzer says the company is aiming toward zero landfill waste in its products and operations. [Editor’s note: Switzer will be speaking at the Environmental Leader 2017 Conference in Denver, June 5-7.] Currently, the Closed Loop Fund has diverted more than 100,000 tons of recyclable content, and the 11 projects currently funded are poised to divert 4 million tons by 2025. In that same timeframe, the Fund aims to: Eliminate more than 40 million tons of greenhouse gas; Divert more than 20 million cumulative tons of waste from landfills; Provide a $40M economic benefit to municipalities; Prove replicable models that will help unlock additional investment in recycling. Last month, Nestlé Waters announced that 9 out of 10 of its Arrowhead Mountain Spring Water bottles incorporate 50% post-consumer recycled plastic content.  As a result, 1.8 billion bottles have been kept from landfills, and the 86 million pounds of recycled plastic has saved 69,660 tons of carbon emissions. In March, Nestlé Waters and Danone — the world’s two largest bottled water companies — said they were partnering to develop and launch at commercial scale a PET plastic bottle made from 100% bio-based material. Meanwhile, the Plastics Industry Association (PLASTICS) has launched a Sustainability Advisory Board. The goal of the board is to enlist a diverse group of plastics industry professionals to discuss and identify sustainability priorities in the plastics industry.   Categories EL Conference, Environmental Management, Feature, Manufacturing, WasteTags Nestle Waters, PET plastic, Recycling Environmental Leader Product and Project Awards 2016 Sponsored By: Environmental Leader    Approaches to Managing EHS&S Data Sponsored By: Enablon    Video: Expense & Data Management for Complex Payables Sponsored By: Ecova, Inc.    Financing Environmental Resiliency and a Low-Carbon Future with Green Bonds Sponsored By: NSF International    Leave a Comment Cancel reply NEWSLETTER NEWSLETTER SIGNUP Join 100,000+ subscribers who gain a competitive advantage with our news and analysis.

Waste360 Staff | May 22, 2017 Nestlé Waters North America is investing $6 million in the Closed Loop Fund, a $100 million social impact investment fund committed to finding a national solution to the critical recycling gap in the U.S. Nestlé Waters will join 3M, Coca-Cola, Colgate-Palmolive, Goldman Sachs, Johnson & Johnson, Keurig Green Mountain, PepsiCo and the PespiCo Foundation, Procter & Gamble, Unilever, Walmart and the Walmart Foundation in funding comprehensive recycling infrastructure and programs in cities across the U.S. “The United States has one of the lowest recycling rates of any industrialized country, but it doesn’t have to stay that way.

World Trademark Review Login Reset password Toggle navigation Home Home Magazine Blog Market intelligence Top TM lawyers WTR 300 Research Legal updates Events Directory Media Brand stewards, fake news, transport woes and a Brexit badge for Brits: INTA 2017 day two report 22 May 17 < Back to Blogs Trevor Little Often the busiest day for attendees, the Monday of the INTA Annual Meeting usually features a full schedule of meetings, sessions, table topics and receptions reaching a crescendo that often goes into the early hours of Tuesday. Trying to keep up with the rapid pace of activities, the World Trademark Review editorial team of Trevor Little (TL), Joff Wild (JW) and Tim Lince (TJL) report on the action. In case you missed it, you can read our highlights from Sunday’s activities and sessions here, and don't forget you can pick up the latest World Trademark Review publications from stand C67-C68 in the exhibition hall. Chaos theory - Respect to delegates and speakers who made it into the conference venue on time this morning. The small matter of a strike on the Barcelona metro has made getting around the city even more of a challenge than usual today – with gridlock on the streets and taxis in short supply. Spare a thought, too, for those law firms and service providers who have hired out venues in the centre of town for receptions this afternoon and this evening. The truth is that a lot of delegates are going to struggle to get to them. Impressive locations, delicious food and free-flowing drinks come at a hell of a cost, but are a staple of every annual INTA meeting because of the client development opportunities and goodwill they create. However, an expensive reception that gets a lower turnout than expected through no fault of your own is not a happy prospect; though it’s one a fair few must be worrying about right now. There will be a lot of marketers and partners offering private prayers that their invited guests will decide not to let the prospect of an hour or more in a cab get in the way of the chance to network over a tasty tapas and a glass or two of wine. (JW)   INTA looks boldly into the future – The opening ceremony of this year’s INTA Annual Meeting (or, as local media has reportedly been calling it, the “World Trademark Congress”) began with some traditional Spanish music, but CEO Etienne Sanz de Acedo’s speech will have also been music to attendee’s ears. While confirming that this year’s conference is the biggest ever (with over 8,000 repeat attendees), he also provided an update on the association’s current membership: 31,000 individual members across over 7,000 organisation in 190 countries. But it was a series of pledges for the future that were at the heart of Sanz de Acedo’s message. At the centre of it all was the 2018-2021 strategic plan (which was sent by email to all members during the opening ceremony, and is also available here). The plan is built on three key tenets: promoting the value of trademarks, reinforcing consumer trust and embracing innovation and change. Indeed, the latter point appears to already be in action, with Sanz de Acedo indicating a striking new direction in the association’s approach to combat the spread of plain packaging legislation. “This fight isn’t just about plain packaging, it goes well beyond that; it’s a concern for companies if they can’t use their rights, and for consumers who won’t be able to identify the origin of their products,” he stated. “This year, we put together a presidential task-force that is looking at building a new narrative around brand restrictions like plain packaging. We know the legal arguments, but the problem is the politicians and legislators need more than that. We need our CEOs to stand up on behalf of brand owners and speak up on the need to protect brands. What if your bottle couldn’t have your trademark on it? It would be a concern for you, your workers and society at large.” One feels that, in light of the recent (leaked) WTO decision, INTA’s task ahead could be a tough one. (TJL) Call yourself a trademark lawyer? Time for a new mission (statement) – Opening the 2015 Annual Meeting, then president J Scott Evans implored trademark counsel to start seeing themselves first and foremost as brand ambassadors, even if that sometimes means making decisions that conflict with long-standing trademark practice. Fast forward two years and – in much the same way that brands themselves are evolving – 2017 president Joseph Ferretti stated that it was time for counsel to go even further. Ferretti provided attendees at the opening addresses a historical overview of brand evolution. From the early 1800s, when brands were a symbol of quality rather than ownership, through to the mid-1900s (when brands started telling stories, one example being Procter and Gamble’s development of sponsored media content, giving birth to the term ‘soap opera’) and up to the present social media age, in which authenticity is key. In the current paradigm, consumers want brands that speak to them, and interact in a meaningful way (at Pepsico, he explained, advertising campaigns have been devised by customers, who are also given the opportunity to vote for the new products they would like to see launched). Alongside this brand evolution, then, trademark counsel need to move with the times. Ferretti stated: “I repeat J Scott’s call but add to it – we should approach work not as technical trademark professionals and brand ambassadors – we should be brand stewards.” This shift, he argued, means that through a deeper understanding of “where brands are going”, counsel will be able to “see the challenges ahead and solve them holistically…” Thus he challenged the audience to “embrace the role of brand steward – someone who understand the values and voice of the brand. By doing so we can help navigate our brands to a successful future. The time has come for us to embrace our role – not just as technical trademark practitioners but more broadly as stewards of our brands.” For those playing INTA bingo, it was telling that ‘brand’ was the term repeatedly used rather than ‘trademark’. In recent years INTA has proactively positioned itself as an association that is brand-facing, rather than solely focused on trademark issues. And this joint focus is enshrined in its new mission statement, unveiled at the opening ceremony: The International Trademark Association is a global association of brand owners and professionals dedicated to supporting trademarks and related intellectual property to foster consumer trust, growth and innovation. (TL) Hopeful about Trump – At the USPTO user meeting, trademark commissioner Mary Boney Denison gave an overview of the office’s previous year and key changes being lined up for the future. A key bugbear for Denison is the persistent use of paper filings, a subject she spoke to us about last year. “Despite raising fees significantly, the current $600 still doesn't cover our costs,” she complained; but went on to confirm that “by the end of the fiscal year” the office is hoping to make it mandatory to file electronically. While that sounds like a significant change, she added that paper filings are nearly phased out already, with only six paper applications submitted during the last week. But the main topic on everyone’s lips was how the new Trump administration will affect the running of the USPTO. In that sense, Denison remained calm and – while admitting that the hiring freeze could be a challenge if the office is unable to bring in more examiners – seemed to be hopeful that the major federal efficiency overhaul that Trump is moving forward with won’t have a significant effect on operations. “Ultimately, we don't take any taxpayer dollars,” she said. “So we hope to be able to hire in the next fiscal year to continue meeting our pendency goals.” (TJL) How the other half live -  The clamour for convenient hotel rooms left many looking at alternative accommodation for their annual INTA excursion. This year it seems a growing number of firms have taken to renting out houses (and yesterday we noted that one had also invited clients to move in with them for the week). As well as making sense financially, this approach can serve a positive bonding purpose. However, not everyone is so keen on doing the dishes with their colleagues. A few law firm representatives have noted that senior management have plumped for hotels over shared accommodation with their team. One lawyer told us that being in shared accommodation, and the antics that ensue, is like being back at college. It looks like some senior professionals are missing out on the fun (and/or the opportunity to make sure that their fellow team members behave!). (TL) A badge for the Brits – It is emerging as a dominant subject of conversation at this year’s INTA meeting. That means for British attendees, there really is no getting away from Brexit. Speaking from the UK IP Office stand in the exhibition hall (the office’s first since 2008), a representative from the agency told World Trademark Review: “We are not here because of Brexit; we are primarily attending this year to bring our attaches together and remind everyone that the UK is open for business. In fact even if the result had gone the other way last year, we would have had a stand here in Barcelona. But, overall, nearly every question has been about Brexit.” And what goes for the UKIPO goes for everyone else from the country in attendance here, too. The problem is that whatever the question the answer has to be the same: “I just don’t know.” Nobody does, not even the British government; just about everything is still up in the air. So, if you are from the UK and you are getting tired and not a little depressed about this subject, World Trademark Review has produced a downloadable card for you to display on your conference ID or somewhere else prominent about your person. Get your “I just don’t know” badge here. Wear it with pride, or not as the case may be. (JW) Lanyard hunt – There are over 10,000 attendees at this year’s Annual Meeting, and nearly all of them have a lanyard around their neck adorned with the name of legal services provider (and sponsor) MarkMonitor. But at least one delegate is not happy about having that brand name around his neck as they are representing a rival legal services company in the exhibition hall. To that end, he has been looking for replacement lanyards to wear instead – and, to date, has not been successful in that endeavour. But the delegate admitted it was a canny move by his rival, and even went to their exhibition stand and said: “Well played.” (TJL) Don’t read too much into the lack of ‘.brand’ registrations - As we inch closer to a second round of new gTLD applications, the question of first round success is often raised, particularly by brands mulling over potential applications. Compare the number of registrations in ‘.brands’ with other new gTLDs and the former are lagging way behind. But when it comes to assessing ‘.brands’, CSC Digital Brand Services’ Gretchen Olive argues that they should be viewed through a different prism. Crucially, she notes that ‘.brands’ are just not in a rush to launch. Nor are they subject to the same pressures to do so, in a bid to recoup their investment through registration sales: “Success is not measured by registrations or profit, but instead the unique strategic business goals of each individual brand.” The operators of branded online spaces, then, are marching to the beat of a different drum. One such is Accenture, with Kristen Poggensee, paralegal associate manager, joining Olive in the ‘‘.brands’ and you’ session. Poggensee is part of a cross-company team – drawing on legal, marketing and IT – that is driving the digital strategy behind ‘.accenture’, and she explained: “Right now we are not looking to just switch from ‘.com’ to ‘.accenture’. Instead we are taking a phased approach and testing the water. This is an evolving strategy.” Central to this are continued efforts to “build awareness – not only within the company but also the community”, engage in industry and competitor analysis, and ensure that senior management remains involved in the project as this evolution continues: “You have to keep interest levels high.” The takeaway? There may not be a big bang moment in terms of ‘.brand’ deployment but don’t regard that as indicating failure. Brand registries are instead working at their own pace, exploring and testing different options, and rolling out only when it is strategically advantageous to do so. (TL) Reception collection – While the INTA Annual Meeting is an excellent event for educational reasons, it is the extensive networking opportunities that really set it apart. Beyond the meetings being held at the main hall, the dozens of receptions that take place every evening – often at the most glamourous event spaces around Barcelona – are a contact-making goldmine for attendees. A difficulty for some, however, is pinpointing exactly where the action is. But a new app aims to change that. IPConnect (which is available on Android and iPhone) describes itself as “a communication app for IP professionals” and includes an event section with many of the receptions listed to aid schedule planning. So for those looking for even more networking before the gruelling INTA week is over, this could be worth an install. (TJL) Attache action - To the centre of town for a Sunday afternoon reception organised by the UK IP Office and the country’s Chartered Institute of Trademark Attorneys. Unsurprisingly given what is coming down the line not two years from now, there was a strong turnout of INTA meeting delegates and plenty of Brexit-related discussion. For the UK’s network of four IP attaches, based in Singapore, China, India and Brazil, the lead-up to departure from the EU will be a particularly busy time. Not least because IP support currently available to British businesses via the European Commission and other European Union institutions, such as the EUIPO, will no longer be available after March 2019. In China, Latin America and South-East Asia, for example, SMEs from any member state are able to make use of the services offered by dedicated IPR helpdesks. There is a lot of free stuff on offer, including advice on dealing with counterfeiting and piracy, forging relationships with local enforcement agencies and general all-round local insight. When cash is tight and knowledge is short, having access to such on-the-ground expertise can be a lifesaver. But for British businesses it will not be a resource for much longer. So how does that get replaced? Indeed, can it be replaced? The UK’s IP attaches are already extremely busy and the IPO is not exactly a ceaseless golden fountain of funds (though the canapes were excellent at the reception), so some very smart thinking will be required, as well as – perhaps –the forging of deeper relationships with IP attaches from other countries; and, whisper it softly so Boris does not hear, even an on-going level of cooperation with those who provide the EU’s services. One of the reasons why the UK’s Brexiteers insisted the country had to leave the EU was so that it could deepen trade links with other parts of the world. A lot of that will be dependent on the ability to ensure strong IP protection; so what the UK cannot afford to do is to reduce the support its exporting SMEs receive as they seek to sell into the world’s emerging markets. The country’s IP attaches will therefore have to play a crucial role in the years to come. Let’s see what kind of financial support they are provided with in order to do this. It would be nice to think they will get what they need; but does anyone believe that they will? (JW) Fake news comes to INTA – One of the most repeated phrases in media and political circles in the past 12 months has been the term “fake news”. What was once a term to describe fictional stories posing as legitimate news (often on websites posing as well-known news brands), is now being used in much more varied, arguably partisan ways. Often not considered are the IP elements involved in the creation of fake news. Today’s session on trademark issues in the publishing industry took a look at just that, with moderator Jeffrey D Parnass of News Corp saying that, surprisingly, the rise of ‘fake news’ has been a boon for major media companies. “News organisations are making money precisely because of fake news as people now want to know the source to ensure they are getting real news,” he said. “This wasn’t necessarily an issue a couple of years ago.”  Nonetheless, the enforcement of fake news by IP counsel at major media titles has really stepped up in the past 12 months. Kate Teh from the Telegraph Media Group gave countless examples of websites that she has dealt with that mimic the popular Telegraph.co.uk website. But, she added, she relies on infringers to respond to a cease-and-desist request because the next steps are often too costly to pursue. “It is a challenge in the newspaper industry because if we don’t get a response to a cease-and-desist letter, there’s not quite enough income generated to take further legal action – especially if the infringement is in another jurisdiction.” Teh revealed that 80% of infringers do respond – which is no doubt a relief for news organisations and people seeking real news.

Nestlé Waters joins the ranks of some of the world’s largest companies, including 3M Co., Coca-Cola Co., Colgate-Palmolive Co., Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Johnson & Johnson, Keurig Green Mountain, PepsiCo Inc. and the PespiCo Foundation, Procter & Gamble Co., Unilever, Wal-Mart, and the Wal-Mart Foundation, as part of Closed Loop Fund. Nestlé Waters says its investment is part of a shared effort among business, government and community partners to fund comprehensive recycling infrastructure and programs in cities across the United States. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates that 75 percent of the waste stream in the U.S. is recyclable, but only 30 percent is recycled. Aside from the environmental impacts, municipalities and businesses in the U.S. spent more than $5 billion in 2015 disposing of materials in landfills. Much of these materials, such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic, is in demand among manufacturers as raw material for everything from textiles to packaging, says Nestlé Waters.  “The United States has one of the lowest recycling rates of any industrialized country, but it doesn’t have to stay that way. The U.S. has an opportunity to lead the way in recycling, while creating jobs, economic growth and a more sustainable future,” says Nelson Switzer, chief sustainability officer at Nestlé Waters North America. “As a company, we are on a very deliberate journey toward zero landfill waste in our products and operations, so I can think of no better opportunity than working collectively to ensure these recyclable materials are transformed from garbage to the valuable resources that they are.”   To date, Closed Loop Fund says it has diverted more than 100,000 tons of recyclable content from landfill, and the 11 projects currently funded are poised to divert 4 million tons by 2025. In that same time frame, the fund aims to: eliminate more than 40 million tons of greenhouse gas; divert more than 20 million cumulative tons of waste from landfills; provide a $40 million economic benefit to municipalities; and prove replicable models that will help unlock additional investment in recycling. “Nestlé Waters’ commitment to Closed Loop Fund is a significant investment in creating shared value across the recycling supply chain,” says Rob Kaplan, managing director of Closed Loop Fund. “The investment will enable people to recycle more, and efficiently turn those packages into new products. It will save taxpayer dollars and improve the recycling system.”   Nestlé Waters says this investment in Closed Loop Fund is the latest in its efforts to help shape products and systems that contribute toward sustainable consumption, and help the company achieve zero environmental impact by 2030. Having pioneered the lightweight bottle, the company says it has reduced the plastic content of its bottles by more than 60 percent since 1994. In April 2017, Nestlé Waters reached a milestone in its use of recycled plastic content (rPET), announcing that 9 out of 10 of its California-born Arrowhead Mountain Spring Water bottles incorporate 50 percent postconsumer recycled plastic content. As a result, 1.8 billion bottles have been kept from landfills, and the 86 million pounds of recycled plastic has saved 69,660 tons of carbon emissions—the equivalent of 39,000 round trip flights from New York to Los Angeles, according to the company.

Reported revenues increased by 19.1 per cent, to £365.5m, compared to consensus forecasts of around £343m. The company also benefited from the later timing of Easter. The East Yorkshire-based company, which joined the FTSE 100 last year, produces ingredients for products ranging from skincare treatments to food additives to wooden floor coatings, with major customers including L’Oréal and Procter & Gamble. Less than 5 per cent of its revenues are generated in the UK, according to estimates from FactSet. When the benefit of currency movements was removed, sales were 4.9 per cent higher than the equivalent period last year. Sales at Croda’s life sciences arm were 1.9 per cent lower than the first quarter last year, but its personal care business returned to growth and its performance technologies business generated “exceptional” growth of 11.7 per cent. The company said it has been “encouraged” by the first quarter performance, and said it is on track to “deliver continued profitable progress” through the rest of the year, though it expects the strong performance technologies growth to moderate.

About Future Resources Staff Contact Privacy Policy Search for: Select Press Releases Home / Press Releases / Nestlé Waters North America Announces $6 Million Investment in Closed Loop Fund Nestlé Waters North America Announces $6 Million Investment in Closed Loop Fund Posted on May 22, 2017 by CSRwire Press Releases, Events and Reports in Press Releases Leadership is an overused word, and is often misused. We like this definition. May 22, 2017 /3BL Media/ – Nestlé Waters North America today announced it is investing $6 million as part of a shared effort among business, government and community partners to fund comprehensive recycling infrastructure and programs in cities across the United States. Nestlé Waters will join the ranks of some of the world’s largest companies – including 3M, Coca-Cola, Colgate-Palmolive, Goldman Sachs, Johnson & Johnson, Keurig Green Mountain, PepsiCo and the PespiCo Foundation, Procter & Gamble, Unilever, Walmart, and the Walmart Foundation – as part of Closed Loop Fund, a $100 million social impact investment fund committed to finding a national solution to the critical recycling gap in the U.S. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates that 75 percent of the waste stream in the U.S. is recyclable, but only 30 percent actually gets recycled.  Aside from the environmental impacts, municipalities and businesses in the U.S. spent over $5 billion in 2015 disposing of waste in landfills. Much of this waste, such as PET plastic, is in demand among manufacturers as raw material for everything from textiles to packaging.   “The United States has one of the lowest recycling rates of any industrialized country, but it doesn’t have to stay that way. The U.S. has an opportunity to lead the way in recycling, while creating jobs, economic growth, and a more sustainable future,” says Nelson Switzer, Chief Sustainability Officer at Nestlé Waters North America. “As a company, we are on a very deliberate journey toward zero landfill waste in our products and operations, so I can think of no better opportunity than working collectively to ensure these recyclable materials are transformed from garbage to the valuable resources that they are.” To date, Closed Loop Fund has diverted more than 100,000 tons of recyclable content, and the 11 projects currently funded are poised to divert 4 million tons by 2025. In that same timeframe, the Fund aims to: Eliminate more than 40 million tons of greenhouse gas; Divert more than 20 million cumulative tons of waste from landfills; Provide a $40M economic benefit to municipalities; Prove replicable models that will help unlock additional investment in recycling. “Nestlé Waters’ commitment to Closed Loop Fund is a significant investment in creating shared value across the recycling supply chain,” said Rob Kaplan, Managing Director of Closed Loop Fund.  “The investment will enable people to recycle more, and efficiently turn those packages into new products.  It will save taxpayer dollars and improve the recycling system.” This investment in Closed Loop Fund is just the latest in Nestlé Waters’ efforts to enhance quality of life and contribute to a healthier future for individuals and families, communities, and for the planet. Having pioneered the lightweight bottle, the company has reduced the plastic content of its bottles by over 60% since 1994. Just last month, Nestlé Waters reached a critical milestone in its use of recycled plastic content (rPET), announcing that 9 out of 10 of its California-born Arrowhead® Mountain Spring Water bottles incorporate 50% post-consumer recycled plastic content.  As a result, 1.8 billion bottles have been kept from landfills, and the 86 million pounds of recycled plastic has saved 69,660 tons of carbon emissions – the equivalent of 39,000 round trip flights from New York to Los Angeles. About Nestlé Waters North America Nestlé Waters North America provides people with an unrivaled portfolio of bottled waters for healthy hydration. Brands such as Nestlé® Pure Life®, Poland Spring®,  Perrier®, and S. Pellegrino® have driven Nestlé Waters North America to be the third largest non-alcoholic beverage company by volume in the U.S. Based in Stamford, Connecticut with over 8,500 employees nationwide, Nestlé Waters is committed to reducing its environmental footprint across operations.  The company is also committed to creating shared value and being a good neighbor in the 140 communities where it operates in the U.S.    About Closed Loop Fund  Founded in 2014, Closed Loop Fund is a social impact investment fund that provides cities and companies access to the capital required to build comprehensive recycling programs. Closed Loop Fund aims to invest $100 million by 2020 with the goal to create economic value for cities by increasing recycling rates in communities across America. Closed Loop Fund brings together the world’s largest consumer product, retail, and financial companies committed to finding a national solution to divert waste from landfills into the recycling stream in order to be used in the manufacturing supply chain. Key supporters include 3M, Coca-Cola, Colgate-Palmolive, Goldman Sachs, Johnson & Johnson Family of Consumer Companies, Keurig Green Mountain, Nestlé Waters North America, PepsiCo and the PepsiCo Foundation, Procter & Gamble, Unilever, Walmart and the Walmart Foundation.

Consumer packaged goods (CPG) companies often find themselves boxed in by customer demand. On one hand, more shoppers say they want to purchase more sustainable products, but many are not willing to pay a premium. And although most consumers still base their purchases largely on price and performance, the trends are clear: Environmental sustainability is expected. This applies to not only products, but also packaging. To make things even more complicated, the pulp and paper supply chain in the U.S. is far different than other countries. The vast majority of forests, especially in the U.S. South, are privately owned. Of the 87 percent of southern forests in private hands, the World Resources Institute estimates that two-thirds are owned by individuals and families – and many of whom held the land for generations. So any progress on sustainable forest stewardship involves far more than holding talks with huge landowners or government forestry officials – a lot of people have to be involved in the conversation. This challenge led CPG giant Procter and Gamble and pulp and paper company Domtar to establish a mutually beneficial working relationship. Domtar, which manufacturers private-label paper products for brands and supplies pulp and fiber to customers like P&G, was on a mission to increase the acreage of certified American forestry lands. P&G is on a quest to attain some level of certification for 100 percent of its paper products – and, eventually, certify all of its brands’ packaging through the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC). Domtar had the relationship with landowners; P&G had the reputation with its brands such as Cottonelle and Charmin. With that synergy, the two companies were able to achieve much on the sustainable forestry front in just a few years. In early talks with landowners, making the case for FSC certification was a challenge, Dan Persica, senior manager of sustainability communications for Domtar, told TriplePundit. “Landowners often see themselves as having a day job; for them, the lands they own are thought of as a space for recreation or hunting,” he explained. “They usually don’t go into these meetings seeing themselves as ‘landowners.’ In fact, they may harvest some wood only once in their lifetime, for a big expense such as helping to pay for school tuition.” Domtar’s challenge was to convince these families that FSC certification was worth the trouble. The company was under pressure to increase its sourcing of certified pulp and paper – and had already taken steps with its supply chain sustainability and transparency tool, The Paper Trail. Domtar now has a team on the ground that is responsible for developing relationships with landowners across much of the Southeastern U.S., and had been supportive of efforts including the Four States Timber Owners Association (FSTOA). But the Montreal-based company needed to make a stronger business case for expanding its FSC-certified supply, and that is where P&G came in. “If we went at it alone, persuading landowners would have been more difficult, even though Domtar has the reputation and relationship with the landowners, Persica told us. “But we don’t have the ‘why,’ and that is where P&G came in.” P&G’s brand reputation helped cement Domtar’s case for recruiting certified FSC growers in the American Southeast. Some of the first landowners who participated in the program also served as testimonials, and many spoke directly to other landowners about FSC and its benefits. Those landowners who were on the fence could listen to their peers’ experiences, visit a mill, learn more about certification and then decide whether or not to move forward. “This interaction was invaluable, as landowners could learn from that word of mouth,” Persica told us. “They could see this in practice, and then the light bulb would go off as they would understand how the process works.” But it’s important to reiterate that Domtar does not own these forests, nor does it lease them. There must be additional incentives for landowners to participate in FSC’s certification programs. To that end, Domtar supports these landowners both logistically and financially. “If they pursue FSC certification, our forest procurement team will help them with that process, starting with breaking down what the actual standards mean to them.” The numbers alone show that this close partnership has paid off for P&G, Domtar, the landowners and the local environment. Over the course of three years, Domtar said it has increased the acreage of FSC-certified forests from 70,000 acres in 2013 to 500,000 last year. The results include less land being converted into residential development, improved stewardship of local land and, most importantly, helping these families keep title to their forests. And for its part, Domtar can say it played a role in offering the market more sustainable products while securing the long-term health of forests across the U.S. South. “It all ladders up to how we want to be seen as a responsible supplier that’s transparent about what’s happening on the ground, and also be trusted to support our customers’ brands,” Persica concluded. “As our customers now see, collaboration is key – we’re not just going to talk the talk, but we will walk it and show you how we can be a responsible and transparent supply chain partner.” Image credit: Domtar Based in Fresno, California, Leon Kaye is a business writer and strategic communications specialist.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 22 May 2017 by wiseguyreports India Diaper Market Major Manufacturers, Trends, Demand, Share Analysis to 2021 In India, of late, hygiene industry is experiencing an unprecedented growth as hygiene products are being adopted into the lifestyle of the masses. With the increased awareness and increasing purchasing power, customers are fast shifting from cloth nappies to baby diapers. Consumers today are looking for baby diapering solutions that go beyond the basic benefits of dryness and go the extra mile to incorporate value-adding features such as softness and caring for their baby’s delicate skin. Indians give birth to around 27 million babies each year, yet the penetration rate of baby diapers remains at less than two percent. Request a sample report @ https://www.wiseguyreports.com/sample-request/744750-india-diapers-market-outlook-2021 According to “India Diaper Market Outlook, 2021”, India’s diaper market was growing with a CAGR of 22.23% over past five years. In 2014, the market for baby diapers in urban India grew with a CAGR of 19.99% whereas in rural India the growth was much higher than urban. On the basis of age, the report categorizes the India diaper market into baby diapers and adult diapers. Baby diapers constitute the leading category in the market. During the forecast horizon, adult diapers market is expected to grow significantly due to the increasing healthcare standards in the country. However, social and economic constraints of using adult diapers are hampering the market growth. P&G’s Pampers dominates the overall diaper industry, followed by Huggies and Mamy Poko. P&G’s lack of innovation and focus on higher margins amid aggressive strategies adopted by its competitors to increase their market share is expected to decrease brand’s market share in future. Japanese firm Unicharm, which sells Mamy Poko diapers, overtook Kimberly Clark in baby diaper segment nearly two years ago. In baby diaper segment, Pampers, Mamy Poko and Huggies constitute more than 85% of the market by value whereas in adult diaper segment, Nobel Hygiene and Actifit dominate the industry heavily. Diapers are broadly categorized into two types i.e. disposable diapers and cloth diapers. Disposable diapers constitute the largest market share and are seeing increasing investments by manufacturers in their research and development. In the last few years modern cloth diapers have become a fast moving trend worldwide for families looking for a natural modern way to diaper their babies. Sales of cloth diapers were 140 lakh units in 2014 and are expected to climb up in the forecast period, owing to environmental benefits. Other type of diapers includes swim pants and training pants which has a marginal market share in India.

"We recently hosted the management team of AxoGen (CEO, CFO, and Chief Medical Officer) and a group of investors to discuss the company's latest developments and upcoming opportunities," it said in a note. The company's portfolio of products includes Avance Nerve Graft - an off-the-shelf processed human nerve allograft for bridging severed nerves, and AxoGuard Nerve Protector, a product used to wrap and protect injured peripheral nerves. Tao Levy, analyst, said that while the company remained focused on bringing awareness to nerve function improvement, pain management was also gaining traction. "Prior treatment for pain involved excising the neuroma and reattaching the nerve to the muscle, but now, surgeons can excise the neuroma and reattach the nerve ends using AxoGen's products. "While management is enthusiastic about this opportunity, it still needs to better understand the proper referral pattern and necessary regulatory work." The broker raised the price target on the shares to $17 from $14. Shares in New York on Monday added 2.71% to $15.15.

Promote your Business on Economictimes.com for free and reach out to millions of potential Customers List Your Business Find Service Near You NEW DELHI: Patanjali Ayurveda, the wellness grocer that has upended India’s well-settled consumer goods leader board, is unhappy with the tax slab proposed for its products under the Goods and Services Tax (GST) plan, the introduction of which would more than double the levy to 12%. "We request the government for a review of the GST rate for the ayurvedic category in the interest of the common man. Without good health or good living, there cannot be ‘achhe din’ (better days),” Patanjali Ayurved spokesperson SK Tijarawala said. Ayurveda products using natural ingredients previously attracted levies of about 5%. Patanjali makes a raft of ayurveda-based consumer products such as toothpaste, shampoos, and cookies. Harnessing the wellness platform, it breached the citadel of transnational consumer companies such as Nestle, Colgate-Palmolive, and Hindustan Unilever, which dominated several product categories for decades in the South Asian nation. The company, with yoga expert Baba Ramdev as its public face, also pitches itself as a home-grown or swadeshi brand that seeks wellness over profits. "Increasing the GST rate on ayurvedic products is disappointing and disheartening. We are the ones who have made ayurveda reach consumers at affordable prices, and other companies have followed our lead,” said the spokesperson, articulating the views of Baba Ramdev. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had inaugurated Patanjali’s research institute in Uttarakhand’s Haridwar earlier this month. Patanjali had generated revenues of Rs 10,561crore in FY17, making it the second-largest consumer goods firm in the country after giant Hindustan Unilever. By sales, Patanjali is ahead of rivals such as Colgate-Palmolive, GSK Consumer Healthcare and P&G Hygiene and Healthcare. Baba Ramdev had said Patanjali toothpaste has a 9% share in the overall sales, followed by hair oil at 8%. Divya Pharmacy, Patanjali’s over-the-counter arm, contributed 8% to the company’s revenue. After Patanjali made disruptive moves in the ayurvedic space, most large consumer goods firms have either directly acknowledged or created categories of herbal products. Other companies directly affected by the increase in GST rates include Dabur and Emami. Dabur India CFO Lalit Malik had said on Friday that the company was ‘disappointed’ with the government’s decision to levy 12% GST on ayurvedic products. "We believe this will have an adverse effect on the category and that too at a time the government has been talking about promoting traditional Indian alternative medicine,” Malik had said. On the impact on consumer prices after the increase in GST rates starting July 1, Patanjali Ayurveda has said it will factor in input credit adjustments before taking a call on retailing rates. Tijarawala had said on Friday that since input costs were being reduced, the company intended to absorb the increased tax outgo. "Initially, we will not pass on any hike to consumers, and review the price strategy at a later stage,” he had said.

U.S. Supreme Court The Supreme Court of the United States announced a number of orders Monday, including the rejection of two Michigan appeals cases. The justices left in place an appeals court ruling that said federal mug shots don't have to be released to the press under the federal Freedom of Information Act. The ruling last July from the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals covers Michigan, Tennessee, Ohio and Kentucky. The U.S. Marshals Service already refuses to release booking photos in other states due to policy or rulings from other courts. The lawsuit was filed by the Detroit Free Press and joined by other media organizations, including the Associated Press. The Court also rejected a challenge by businesses seeking more than $1 billion in tax refunds from Michigan. The justices turned away an appeal of Michigan court rulings that upheld changes the state made to the way business taxes are assessed. The companies that filed the suit include IBM, Goodyear, Proctor & Gamble and others. The businesses said they were being treated unfairly because the state retroactively changed its tax laws, and argued that the laws are unconstitutional and violate the Multistate Tax Compact. Gov. Rick Snyder signed a measure into law in 2014 that affected business taxes back to 2008. The law was upheld by a Michigan appeals court.

The justices on Monday left in place a lower court ruling that said the automaker's 2009 bankruptcy did not shield it from liability in the cases. Reporter wants video after inmate's unusual death By Stateside Staff • Apr 7, 2017 Flickr user spyker3292 / http://j.mp/1SPGCl0 Listen Listening... / 5:37 Stateside's conversation with Spencer Woodman, a New York-based freelance reporter. Last September at the Bellamy Creek Correctional Center near Ionia, an inmate died. He’d been in some kind of confrontation with another prisoner. Corrections officers used stun guns to subdue 24-year-old Dustin Szot, who was serving time for home invasion. An autopsy listed his death as a homicide due to blunt force trauma. That's according to a recent article by The Detroit Free Press' Paul Egan. FOIA bills pass House committee, may not make it much further By Cheyna Roth • Mar 9, 2017 Lindsey Smith / Michigan Radio A battle is brewing in the state legislature over government transparency for the governor and legislature.   A large package of Freedom of Information bills that passed a House committee Thursday will likely be halted in the state Senate.    © 2017 Michigan Radio About Us Contact Us Public Documents Jobs Help with Streaming Contest Rules Events Privacy & Terms of Use

(NASDAQ: AAPL) is trading within striking distance of its all-time highs of $156.65, which means it's less than $200 billion away from trading at a $1 trillion valuation. CNBC's Jim Cramer talked about Apple's path toward achieving this milestone during Monday's "Squawk on the Street" segment. According to Cramer, Apple is a consumer products company led by its iPhone but accompanied with a great services revenue stream. Razor, Meet Razor Blade As such, Apple is a classic example of a "razor/razor blade" story and not certainly one about key buzzwords like cloud, social and mobile. He emphasized that once a company is not a cloud, social or mobile company, it loses out on valuation metrics and "becomes a cheaper stock than a Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE: CL) or Procter & Gamble Co (NYSE: PG)." Both consumer household goods companies are in fact trading at a higher P/E multiple of 26.96 and 24.12 versus Apple's 18.0 P/E but this narrative could change as soon as the $1,000 priced iPhone 8 could help push the stock even closer to the $1 trillion valuation mark. Cramer continued that many surveys are pointing to a strong iPhone 8 cycle, as many iPhone 5 and iPhone 6 owners are waiting to upgrade to a device that could even replace their laptop computers. But Apple fans shouldn't get too excited just yet, as a potential IPO from Saudi Arabia's oil behemoth Saudi Aramco could be valued as much as $10 trillion.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 22 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Women Are Changing the Face of Facilities Management By: Charlotte Jensen SOURCE: Sodexo, Inc. DESCRIPTION: Facilities management has long been a male-dominated career field. In fact, it may be even more lopsided than many other male-dominated fields: In facilities management (FM), men outnumber women in leadership roles by nine to one, according to a recent survey from the College and University Professional Association for Human Resources. That’s slowly starting to change, however, as a growing number of women are beginning careers as facilities managers. It’s a welcome change, and one that’s likely to improve the quality of life in many facilities. Diversity is especially important in facilities management because it’s a field that is, at its core, about people. “As facility managers, we have a lot of control over the built environment, which we know can have a profound impact on facility occupants’ productivity as well as their health and wellbeing,” says Melanie Young, a resident district manager at Sodexo in Canada. “If our FM teams aren’t diverse themselves, how can we ensure we are truly understanding and empathetic to increasingly diverse populations and their unique needs?” Female facilities managers might be able to better predict and intuit the needs of women who use those facilities. They might be more likely to, for example, understand that the wait-times for women’s restrooms are always longer, so it would make sense to add more stalls. Adding more people from different backgrounds means bringing more ideas to the growing FM field. Having more ideas means there’s a better chance of selecting the best one. “Increasing the representation of women in all aspects of FM brings additional diversity of thought to the field. This helps us deliver best-in-class solutions to our clients.” says Elinor Ochoa, a facilities district manager for five Texas and Oklahoma school districts. “Everyone is unique and brings a different viewpoint to the workplace,” says Brooke Spaulding, the facilities operations manager at P&G Gillette, a Sodexo site. “Encouraging more women to work in FM will help generate a greater diversity of thoughts and insights, which can only help us progress and show growth to our clients, who are also gender diverse.” Spaulding also notes that the dearth of women in various industries can feed on itself. “Women currently in the field may get discouraged or be less likely to share ideas if they don’t feel supported,” she says.

"Following" : "Follow"}} May 22, 2017 8:32am   Comments Share: Related KXI Consumer Staple ETFs Remain Steady In 2015 Argus Research Analyst John Staszak Says Coca-Cola, WhiteWave Partnership Is A 'Good Idea' Investors looking to liven up the consumer staples trade via exchange-traded funds have several options. There are fundamentally-weighted smart beta strategies, small-cap staples ETFs, mid-cap staples ETFs and equal-weight products devoted to the sector. Another idea is combing U.S. staples stocks with some of their international peers, an objective that is conveniently accomplished via the iShares Global Consumer Staple(ETF) (NYSE: KXI). KXI is proof positive that international staples stocks are working this year. Geographical Exposure With Global ETF The iShares Global Consumer Staples ETF, as its name implies, is a global ETF, not an international fund. That means the ETF holds both U.S. and international staples names. KXI, which is nearly 11 years old and tracks the S&P Global 1200 Consumer Staples Sector Index, allocates 53.3 percent of its geographic weight to the U.S. That means investors in KXI are getting robust exposure to familiar U.S. staples names such as Dow components Procter & Gamble Co (NYSE: PG) and The Coca-Cola Co (NYSE: KO). Those venerable staples stocks are two of KXI's top five holdings and combine for nearly 11 percent of the ETF's weight. However, the ex-U.S. exposure is a difference maker for this ETF in 2017. Year-to-date, KXI is up 12.6 percent, an advantage of 500 basis points over the US-focused Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLP). KXI has also been slightly less volatile this year than XLP, the largest consumer staples ETF by assets. The U.K., Switzerland and the Netherlands are three of KXI's four largest country weights after the U.S. That trio of countries are home to some large- and mega-cap staples stocks that trade in New York. While KXI's geographic mix is rewarding investors to this point in 2017, investors should be mindful of the potential currency risk with an ETF like this. Many large-cap U.S. staples companies are multi-national firms that benefit from a weaker dollar. Conversely, KXI's international holdings benefit from a weaker euro, franc and pound, among other currencies. For investors looking for conservative sector-level exposure with some international diversity, the time could be right to consider KXI. Historical data suggest the staples sector performs admirably over the next few months of the year.

The answer's unclear By SYDNEY LUPKIN AND PAULINE BARTOLONE Kaiser Health News LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Sherry Herman was watching TV when the ad popped up on the screen. Lawyers were seeking clients for a class-action lawsuit, suggesting a link between certain heartburn pills and chronic kidney disease – including the beige capsules she'd taken for years. "And I was like, 'Oh my gosh, yeah – me!'" said Herman, a 50-year-old homemaker in Dayton, Ohio. She'd been on a drug known as a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) for acid reflux disease since 2004. Thinking it was a "very safe drug," she had taken the prescription pills for a decade, even though the label recommended four to eight weeks. Then, in 2014, she was diagnosed with chronic kidney disease. "It came as a huge shock because no one in my family has it," she said. She had no risk factors for the condition, such as poorly controlled high blood pressure. A growing body of research suggests the blockbuster drug that helped her stomach may have left her – and a number of patients like her – with a potentially much more serious medical problem. Recent research has linked the proton pump inhibitors, or PPIs, to serious side effects, including chronic kidney disease, and recently filed lawsuits allege, among other things, that the manufacturers should have known of their potential harms. The risk of chronic kidney disease is as much as 50 percent higher in people who've taken the drug compared with those who've not – although no causative link has been proven and manufacturers insist they are safe. The drugmakers strongly defend their products. AstraZeneca is "confident in the safety and efficacy of Nexium and Prilosec when used in accordance with the FDA approved label," said spokeswoman Abby Bozarth, in an emailed statement. Proton pump inhibitors, such as Nexium and Prilosec, among other brands, are blockbusters in the U.S. With 15.3 million prescriptions written in 2013 alone, they are considered highly effective at relieving gastroesophageal acid reflux as well as preventing and treating ulcers. Widely advertised, they are frequently prescribed for even minor indigestion, with serial renewals leading to chronic use – even though they were approved as safe by the Food and Drug Administration only for short-term treatment. Studies have shown that PPIs could be prescribed unnecessarily as much as two-thirds of the time. And it's not uncommon for patients to take the heartburn pills for years, even though their labels recommend limiting treatment to a few weeks or a few months. The result has been sales worth many billions of dollars a year for pharmaceutical companies, according to commercial intelligence firm EvaluatePharma. Tens of millions of Americans take the drugs, whether in prescription or over-the-counter formulation. Given those numbers, critics say that even the suggestion of risk is a problem for a drug that is over-prescribed by doctors and used inappropriately by patients. "When patients complain of gastrointestinal distress, it's easy to just prescribe a PPI," said Steven Chen, a doctor of pharmacy and associate dean for clinical affairs at the University of Southern California School of Pharmacy. Once patients start taking the drug, it's easy to "forget that they may not need to be on it that long." What's more, fueling debate and the emerging lawsuits is FDA's patchwork system that experts say is poorly equipped to track adverse events – even when they involve drugs like the PPIs that have been used by many millions of American over three decades. With no universally mandatory system to track the use of drugs and their side effects over time, the U.S. instead relies on manufacturers, doctors and patients to convey suspicion of harm as part of a mostly voluntary system. Dr. Sammy Almashat, of the research group Public Citizen, said only a small fraction of side effects are reported to the FDA and the database is "underutilized" by researchers and regulators. "We do what we can in this country with what we're given. It's not much." PPIs, which came to market in 1990, were a godsend for many patients. When Paula Cox, 69, of Bainbridge Island, Wash., first tried Prilosec, it was like "heaven" because the medication prevented the "extremely intense" heartburn symptoms that had plagued her since the 1980s. She's been on the pills for more than 14 years, and although she hasn't suffered any of the major health problems linked to them by research, she'd like to stop her daily regimen, especially in light of news about possible side effects. But Prilosec is "the only thing that's working," Cox said. PPIs work by blocking an enzyme in the cells that line the stomach, preventing them from secreting acid. They are the leading proven therapy for upper-gastrointestinal disorders, available by prescription and, in lower doses, over the counter. Chronic kidney disease damages the organs over time, rendering the body unable to eliminate wastes from the blood and excrete them through urine. The disease can be life-threatening, and patients may need dialysis or a kidney transplant to survive. Two huge studies, including data from hundreds of thousands of patients taking prescription PPIs, raised concerns about a link between the pills and kidney failure in 2016. (Over-the-counter medications were not studied because of the difficulty of collecting data.) Both studies, one published in JAMA Internal Medicine and the other in the Journal of the American Society of Nephrology, found that those taking prescription PPIs were more likely to develop kidney disease than patients taking another class of drugs known as H2 blockers, which treat similar digestive symptoms. The research showed that patients taking the PPIs twice a day were more likely to develop the disease, and that the kidney risk associated with the pills increased over time for the first two years. Each study had the same limitation: It was "observational," meaning it was not a gold-standard clinical trial that could prove cause and effect. Based on a collection of health records, the research could identify only association – i.e., whether patients taking PPIs were more likely to develop chronic kidney disease than patients who weren't on the drugs. "Although they're seen as pretty benign medicines, (they) may not be," said Johns Hopkins nephrologist Dr. Morgan Grams, noting that the drugs might cause damage by lowering magnesium levels or triggering an immune reaction. But others, like Dr. John Danziger, a nephrologist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and a professor at Harvard Medical School, are skeptical about the association noting that PPIs have also been tied to a number of other risks, including a rare type of infectious diarrheas, pneumonia and bone fracture. "Is it that the PPI is really causing all these different things or is it the fact that sicker people get PPIs and sicker people have bad outcomes?" Danziger said. "I think it's probably the latter." The experience of Harry Mason, 69, shows how difficult it is to sort out the question of cause and effect, and the legal quandaries that arise from that. The Vietnam veteran from western Illinois "suffered kidney failure requiring a kidney transplant while taking Nexium as prescribed in 2006," according to a lawsuit he filed against AstraZeneca in May 2016. But he has also had congestive heart failure, diabetes and an enlarged prostate, and he takes medication to control his cholesterol. While a law firm initially advised him to sue, it later dropped the case because it determined his kidneys were likely harmed by something else, said Mason. AstraZeneca had filed a request to dismiss the case, claiming Mason's "sweeping accusations" weren't backed up with facts. Attorney Paul Pennock said his New York-based firm, Weitz & Luxenberg, is investigating roughly 3,500 cases involving kidney harm allegedly from heartburn drugs, although he acknowledges not all will merit a lawsuit. Nationwide, Pennock said, about 122 suits have been filed, against AstraZeneca and other PPI makers such as Takeda Pharmaceuticals, Pfizer and Procter & Gamble, which produces over-the-counter Prilosec. Allyanna Anglim of Pfizer media relations says legal actions against the company are "without merit" and its PPI labels "have always provided accurate information on their benefits and risks." Why, after all these years, aren't the risks better known? FDA spokeswoman Andrea Fischer said data linking chronic kidney disease and PPIs "are limited" but that the agency continues to monitor the potential risks. Both medical researchers and the Government Accountability Office have concluded that its methods for doing so are inadequate. Reports to the FDA mentioning PPIs in relation to a range of kidney problems trickled in and reached a few dozen per year by the late 1990s, according to a Kaiser Health News analysis of the federal Adverse Event Reporting System. The number of kidney-related reports naming PPIs as a primary suspect slowly crept up over the years and then doubled to more than 400 in 2016, the year the two prominent studies were published. Doctors, consumers and manufacturers submit the reports mostly voluntarily, and they are not verified. The full side-effects profile of the pills only slowly becomes apparent over the years. Based on dozens of studies and cases, the FDA began requiring PPI labels to include the risk of bone fracture, low magnesium and infectious diarrhea from 2010 to 2012. Through a lawsuit, the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen forced the FDA in 2014 to add acute interstitial nephritis, a kidney disorder in which structures in the kidneys become swollen, said the nonprofit's Almashat. Public Citizen is not planning further action on PPIs in light of the two recent studies flagging chronic kidney disease, but as more research is published the organization may consider it. Research about the potential harms of PPIs don't mean the "sky is falling," but doctors should have a "nuanced" conversation with patients about the risks versus benefits of the drugs, said Dr. Kenneth DeVault, a past president of the American College of Gastroenterology. He considers recent PPI research when deciding whether he should prescribe the medication, he said, as should other gastroenterologists. Sherry Herman of Ohio has decided to keep taking her generic PPI even though she has stage 3 kidney disease, for the pain relief it gives. "It's such a scary thing to me that I just try to block it out," she said. (Kaiser Health News (KHN) is a national health policy news service. It is an editorially independent program of the Henry J.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 22 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Grand Opening of New Springdale Sam’s Club Set for Thursday SPRINGDALE, Ark.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–The newest Sam’s Club in Northwest Arkansas will open its doors Thursday, May 25 at 1517 S. 56th St. in Springdale. The public is invited to join the celebration, which kicks off with a grand opening ceremony at 8 a.m. Olympic gymnast and gold medalist Laurie Hernandez will join the celebration later that day with a meet and greet with fans. The new club is located in a rapidly growing area just off I-49 in Springdale near the Arvest Ballpark and the future Arkansas Children’s Northwest. “The opening of a new Sam’s Club is exciting news for any community, but I can’t imagine any city being more excited than Springdale,” said Springdale Mayor Doug Sprouse. “Our residents have been eagerly anticipating the return of Sam’s Club, and this new location will not only benefit Springdale families, but will also spur future development in our overlay district.” New club features The Springdale location has a new look and feel based on some of the successful features from the Bentonville club remodel. The club will feature a Fresh Island that offers organic and grass-fed beef, an expanded seafood section, and fresh sushi made daily. The focus on fresh carries throughout the dairy and produce departments with large walk-in coolers designed to keep products as fresh as possible. An additional feature members will experience is an updated café with self-order kiosks, expanded seating with charging stations and an updated menu that includes premium coffee, made-to-order sandwiches, and smoothies. Members can continue to count on Sam’s Club for their health and wellness needs. The new club will provide pharmacy services as well as a hearing center and optical department. Shopping made simple Members of the Springdale club can utilize the company’s award winning smartphone app called Scan & Go, which allows users the option of scanning their items while they shop and simply paying on their phone in lieu of the traditional checkout experience. The Springdale club will also offer the drive-thru convenience of Club Pickup – a concierge service for members who prefer to place an online order and pick merchandise up at a scheduled time. Commitment to community As part of the grand opening festivities, Sam’s Club will be awarding nearly $20,000 in grants to several local nonprofit organizations. About half of that amount was raised through the company’s Volunteerism Always Pays (VAP) program. Springdale associates have volunteered nearly 700 hours already this year, raising funds for area programs such as the Fallen Soldier Memorial Project in Springdale and Big Brothers Big Sisters of Northwest Arkansas. “Our associates have been eager to help local organizations that support our community,” said Springdale Club Manager Mark Byrd. “I couldn’t be more excited about the great team we have in place that is passionate about giving back and serving our members.” Sam’s Club is also proud to support small business owners through the company’s Road Show program. This consignment-based program provides local, regional, and national entrepreneurs the chance to set up shop inside Sam’s Club while providing members access to exciting and one-of-a-kind products. Springdale’s grand opening will feature several local products including House of Webster gourmet salsa and Cedar Lake Mount Comfort Coffee. Members will also enjoy Nature Nate’s Honey, Blues Hog BBQ sauce, and Rawlings Leather Goods. Entrepreneurs interested in participating in future Road Shows should contact their local Sam’s Club manager for more details. Grand opening ceremony to feature local officials, special events Springdale Mayor Doug Sprouse and Springdale Chamber of Commerce President Perry Webb will be among those attending Thursday’s grand opening ceremony. The American Legion will present the colors and the Har-Ber High School Glee Club will perform the national anthem. Other groups providing entertainment during the ceremony include the Walmart Choir and Mariachi Amistad de Arkansas band. To add to the excitement, gymnast and Olympic gold medalist, Laurie Hernandez will be signing autographs for fans on grand opening day from 3 p.m. to 5 p.m. Her appearance is made possible by Procter & Gamble. Membership information Being a member of Sam’s Club means more than a membership card – it means exclusive access to great products, brands and services, at amazing values. Sam’s Club memberships range from $45 to $100. As part of a grand opening membership promotion, residents can get a $20 gift card when they sign up as a new member through June 4.

clock menu more-arrow How Anker is beating Apple and Samsung at their own accessory game by Nick Statt@nickstatt May 22, 2017, 10:19am EDT Illustrations by William Joel Photography by James Bareham share tweet Linkedin Steven Yang quit his job at Google in the summer of 2011 to build the products he felt the world needed: a line of reasonably priced accessories that would be better than the ones you could buy from Apple and other big-name brands. These accessories — batteries, cables, chargers — would solve our most persistent gadget problem by letting us stay powered on at all times. There were just a few problems: Yang knew nothing about starting a company, building consumer electronics, or selling products. “I was a software engineer all my life at Google. I didn’t know anyone in the electronics manufacturing world,” Yang tells me over Skype from his office in Shenzhen, China. But he started the company regardless, thanks in no small part to his previous experience with Amazon’s sellers marketplace, a platform for third-party companies and tiny one- or two-person teams interested in selling directly to consumers. He named the company Anker, after the German word for ship anchor. The steady rise of the company’s profile... is proof that it’s possible to meet one very specific consumer need and ride that wave Anker has since become the most popular brand of portable battery packs on Amazon. Portable chargers had a bit of a standout moment last summer, when players of the wildly-popular and battery-hogging Pokémon Go could be seen roaming the streets, their phones constantly plugged in. But these accessories have existed for years as a remedy for our battery woes since the standard smartphone tends to last no more than a day on a single charge. So in airports, the back of cabs, and on city streets we’re plugging into lithium-ion slabs in our pockets and bags to stay connected. The market for portable battery packs generated $360 million in the 12 months ending in March, 2017 in the US alone. The brands behind these packs are largely anonymous — Kmashi, Jackery, and iMuto — and they often stay that way. Except Anker. The steady rise of the company’s profile is proof that it’s possible to meet one very specific consumer need and ride that wave as it continues to ripple out to other markets. A majority of Anker’s sales come from cables and wall chargers, and it’s now moving into the smart home and auto market — anywhere a plug and a cable can solve a problem. Yang and his team started a company with the sole purpose of selling a better third-party accessory. But they stumbled onto a more lucrative reality: mobile phones, once niche luxury items, are now ubiquitous centerpieces of our digital lives. Each of these phones, and all the products that connect to them, need their own cable and plug. And each and every day these devices die before we want them to. PowerCore 10000 If there’s anything you should know about smartphone development over the last ten years, it’s this: batteries are not lasting longer. Phones may be thinner and faster, with larger screens and better cameras, but they don’t stay powered for longer than a day, perhaps 36 hours at best. The culprit is the fundamental science of lithium-ion batteries, which are tremendous at storing energy but only within limited size and capacity constraints. The lithium-ion batteries we have today operate at about a fifth of their potential storage capacity, says Lynden Archer, a professor of chemical engineering at Cornell University. And yet that’s still at about 90 percent of the maximum potential today’s battery science allows. “A breakthrough would require a new paradigm,” he says. “A huge part of Anker’s success is the fact that our batteries don’t last long enough.” That stagnation has allowed Anker to flourish. “A huge part of Anker’s success is the fact that our batteries don’t last long enough,” says Joanna Stern, a technology columnist and gadget reviewer for The Wall Street Journal. “They saw that accessories needed to be made to address customers’ pain points. They’re making the chargers, the cases, the cords — and they’re making it for affordable prices so you can have one of these in every place you are.” Mobile battery packs weren’t the company’s initial goal. In the late 2000s, Yang identified a consumer need not being met: well-built, reliable laptop battery replacements. “You have a Dell or HP laptop — let’s assume you got it in 2009 — and in 2011 the battery is dying and you want to get a new one,” he says. Back then you had two choices: buy directly from Dell or HP, with a high price tag, or buy a white-label battery that’s cheap but poorly made. “Which one do I want to buy?” asks Yang. “The answer is neither of them.” Yang saw a desire for a better type of accessory — one that wouldn’t cost as much as a replacement straight from the original manufacturer, but that would be of a high enough quality to earn consumers’ trust. Before he could sell that product, he needed to figure out how to make it. It was a long and painful process. After he quit his job at Google in July of 2011, Anker took 12 months just to prototype its first laptop battery. That was even after Yang and the core team moved to Shenzhen to find reliable manufacturing partners. “I knew that if I stayed in California and had people FedEx me prototypes in a week, it was just not going to work,” he says. Many hardware companies, especially crowdfunded ones in the US, learn that lesson the hard way, by missing deadlines and hitting snags that lead to months-long delays. A solid supply chain is so crucial to a hardware company’s survival that there’s an entire consulting industry around helping startups find suppliers and set expectations. Critical to avoiding these pitfalls was Dongpong Zhao, Google’s then-head of sales in China. Zhao joined Anker in early 2012, and helped Yang build out the company’s supply chain. Anker was made up of around ten people at the time. “Think of it as a small family business instead of like an actual company,” Yang says. The company tirelessly built out a supply chain in its first year and began testing its first products — the laptop chargers and batteries it would begin selling direct to consumers on Amazon. “We were able to make cell phone battery cells that actually had slightly better capacity,” Yang says. “That got us quite the reputation.” From there, Anker ventured into smartphone batteries with a replacement unit for the HTC Sensation. “We were able to make cellphone battery cells that actually had slightly better capacity,” Yang says. “That got us quite the reputation.” Early on, Anker developed close relationships with suppliers in Asia, including Panasonic and anode supplier BTR, to help test and quickly develop new batteries. Yang says he and Anker’s small team “definitely saw the explosion of smart devices” as its biggest and most obvious opportunity, and Anker started aggressively expanding into portable battery packs, wall chargers, and cables. By the end of 2012, after shifting more resources toward portable chargers, Yang says Anker went from selling 100 to 1,000 products per day. “The challenge wasn’t selling products,” Yang says. “It was making products and making sure they were high-quality as well. That’s why we spent a majority of our effort on R&D and product development.” The company does a majority of its sales directly to consumers over Amazon Marketplace, where a combination of strong reviews, low prices, and prominent placement in search rankings can turn a single product into a lucrative line. For the accessories market, which tends to piggyback off trends in mainstream consumer electronics, a true breakthrough is rare. But Anker found one in charging, based on the realization that while batteries may not be improving, charging time certainly was. According a study conducted last year by PhoneArena, it took more than two hours on average to charge a device to 100 percent in 2013. Today, it can be done in almost half the time. So Anker set out to make the fastest chargers available. Take the PowerPort 5, a matte black rectangle no larger than a deck of playing cards, with five USB ports. When it was first introduced in 2015, it was the only accessory on the market capable of charging five devices simultaneously at optimal speed. Or the company’s standard PowerCore portable charger, roughly the size of a credit card and just under one inch thick — a white block encasing 10,000mAh of lithium-ion battery cells. It has four pinholes that light up in LED blue when you press an elliptical button on the top to check its remaining charge. It can refill a depleted iPhone 7 in just over 60 minutes nearly four times over before it needs to be recharged. Most Anker charging products have one signature: the PowerIQ logo. Launched in 2013, the company’s proprietary charging standard is now present on nearly all of its batteries and wall plugs. The technology, carried by a small chip inside each charger, identifies whatever device is being plugged in, be it an iPhone 7 Plus, Google Pixel, or an iPad Pro 9.7-inch, in order to detect and deliver the maximum current the product allows. Anker says the technology can shave hours off the amount of time it takes to reach a full charge. A next-generation version of the chip, a sequel to PowerIQ, is slated to start shipping in new Anker charging products later this year, allowing for smaller and lighter accessories. On top of its products’ technical advantages, Anker banks on looks to make its chargers stand out. Brand manager Elisa Lu says every device’s packaging is carefully thought out from the moment customers receive the product, to when they open it and use it. Devices come in a white and light-blue box with the name Anker printed in all caps across the front. Inside is a meticulously packaged arrangement of lightweight cardboard. Anker products carry that new-gadget smell — a blend of peculiar odors from the evaporation of chemical compounds in the plastics and the epoxy coatings of the device. Beside its red cables, which Anker offers in both standard and braided nylon versions, and a single one-off red battery pack, the company sells products in only two color options: black and white. All this has a strategic business purpose. “When our consumers receive our products, we want to make sure they know they are getting it from a reliable and trustworthy company,” Lu says. Brand trust is a pivotal consideration when purchasing what may seem like random electronics off Amazon. Inside the the box with Anker’s larger products, you’ll also find a small square piece of paper with two questions: are you happy, or are you unhappy? If you’re unhappy, a block of text instructs you to contact Anker customer support via phone, email, or on its website. If you’re satisfied, it asks you to tell your friends or family. Better yet, leave an Amazon review. PowerCore Slim 5000 In many ways, Anker’s success is born from the failures of premier manufacturers like Apple and Samsung. Where those companies introduce points of friction — like ever-thinner devices with short battery lives — Anker offers a remedy. “My feeling is that Anker is a success because Apple offers such subpar and expensive accessories,” says Stern, who’s often recommended Anker products in her WSJ column. It may be surprising that Apple sat idly as the accessory market ballooned around it; it took the company years to develop its own battery case for the iPhone to compete with Mophie. But Apple has always favored high margins on premium products, even the cables and earbuds it sells in the Apple Store. This has given ample room to companies like Anker, with the low overhead of an e-commerce business, to sell similar products of near-identical quality for $10 to $20 cheaper. And where Apple and others failed to develop products of their own like multi-port wall plugs and portable chargers, Anker saw the opportunity and capitalized on it. The company is quick to fill gaps created by smartphone manufacturers. When Apple removed the headphone jack on the iPhone 7, for instance, Anker saw a giant opportunity to begin producing new dongles and other cable adapters to help consumers adjust. But mastering Amazon was the real key to securing Anker’s future. Search for a generic accessory like “cell phone wall charger” or “Lightning cable” and you’ll find the Anker brand high up in the search results If you head over to Amazon.com right now and peruse the retailer’s most popular smartphone accessories and you’ll find Anker products at the top. Search for a generic accessory like “cell phone wall charger” or “Lightning cable” and you’ll find the Anker brand high up in the search results, typically with a 4.5 or 5-star rating. In fact, Anker products take up the first five slots on Amazon’s list of best-selling portable batteries. And alongside the ratings, you’ll find thousands of customer reviews — reviews that the company scans meticulously for ideas on how to improve their development process. Two years before he left Google, Yang became intimately familiar with Amazon’s Marketplace when he built an automated system for a friend who was selling third-party products on Amazon as a side business. It essentially took care of aspects of the business like inventory, logistics and fulfillment, and sales tracking. “It took me two months, evenings and weekends, to develop this system,” Yang explained in a video produced by Amazon last year to promote entrepreneurship on its platform. “Within a month, she was fulfilling 300 orders a day.” Building this system gave Yang invaluable insight into how third-party selling on Amazon functioned. He discovered what worked and what didn’t, and how entire brands could crop up overnight and fade into obscurity the next day. Anker thrived by borrowing infrastructure from Amazon and relying on engineering and support in China. “Amazon provides loads of services — financial services, fulfillment. It actually makes selling a low-barrier thing,” Yang says. Although the company attempted to handle its own fulfillment in its early days, it eventually discovered it could not compete with what Amazon offered. Now, about 95-percent of Anker’s products are listed as “Fulfilled by Amazon.” You can build an online retail business off Amazon, but making sure your products get exposure is the hard part. “The biggest challenge for Anker is not sales. It’s customer perception,” Yang says. “People think they need [Apple’s] cube charger and stock cable.” Teaching people that there is a superior product out there, and then convincing them to keep buying, is Anker’s core challenge. “Amazon reviews were really enormously helpful,” Yang says. “The Amazon reviews just come and come automatically.” PowerLine+ USB-C to USB 3.0 Silicon Valley is full of breathless mission statements designed to inspire and justify the power and influence of technology, like Apple’s famous “think different” slogan, and Google’ ominous and now defunct “don’t be evil” mantra. Facebook, back in 2012, celebrated its billion-user milestone with an ad comparing the social network to chairs, bridges, and even nations. Anker has never aspired to such grand ambitions. “At Anker, we can't exactly help you unwind,” the company admits on its Amazon sellers page. Instead, Anker takes a more straightforward approach by solving the inevitable problems technology creates. “Say goodbye to first-world tech woes like oppressive low batteries and limited ports,” the page says. “Say hello to an easier, smarter life.” Yang is trying to extend this simple philosophy to categories like headphones, speakers, phone cases, and now smart home appliances under a new brand called Eufy. Launched last September, Eufy is Anker’s avenue for selling things like Roomba clones, desk lamps, and bathroom scales. Expanding into more product categories is a logical evolution for Anker, but it’s also a response to a looming existential threat: Yang says he foresees a future where portable chargers won’t be necessary due to advancements in both fast charging and wireless charging. “I think we all agree that the portable charger isn’t forever,” Yang says. But consumers will always need wall plugs and cables, and Anker sees its goal now as keeping pace with changing standards, like the introduction of USB-C. PowerCore 5000 In the meantime, Yang says it’s diversifying with a future expansion into audio, smart home, and automotive product lines. Anker already produces Bluetooth headphones and speakers, but it has aspirations to compete with the likes of Harman Kardon and Bose. Key to the success of those products is moving to brick-and-mortar retailers. Terrence Wang, the company’s chief marketing officer hired from Procter & Gamble in 2015, says having a presence in Best Buy and Walmart, a process that began last year, is the next stage of Anker’s evolution. “Expanding from online to offline is critical actually,“ Wang says. “We are trying to get as many people to know that they have a simple, convenient, portable, fast solution rather than just have to bring their own charger wherever they go. That’s the original brand vision.” The company’s focus on storefront retail is a response to a second very real threat — dependence on a direct-to-consumer online-only model. The company has found it difficult these days to launch new products on Amazon. Older products have thousands of reviews, while newer ones need to earn placement in the search rankings and collect testimonials before more cautious buyers pull the trigger. “We’re seeing a bit of a dilemma on that one,” Yang says. “To a lot of people, the original charger and the original cable are the only means to charge their devices.” The company is also struggling with its complex product line, with a dizzying number of choices that may alienate consumers who are looking for a simple choice. “We’re converging to this generation approach,” Yang says. “So we’ll try to release a generation of products every 18 to 24 months.” Choosing which products to promote at Best Buy, which to discontinue, and where to put resources for the future are all part of Anker’s growing pains. The company’s success hinges on convincing — or “educating” — their consumers about the value of what they’re offering. Yang likes to tell a story about a moment he sees play out on repeat every single time he’s at an airport, anywhere on the planet. He sees people, smartphones in hand, rushing from outlet to outlet, looking for space with “the little Apple cube in their hands” and running out of options. “To a lot of people, the original charger and the original cable are the only means to charge their devices, in their mind,” he says. “I look at those people and I always want to go up to them and talk to them.” Instead, Yang and the Anker team started conducting an annual consumer survey. It has only one question: how often does your smartphone run out of battery? Once every day? Once a week? Once a month? Or perhaps never? “Forty percent of people say their battery ran out at least once last week, another 40 percent say at least once last month,” Yang says. “As long as these numbers don’t go down, I think we have a lot of work to do.” Policy & Law PayPal burns Pandora to the ground in lawsuit over logo similarities Circuit Breaker The Finger Spinner iOS game is about free-to-play monetization, not fidget spinning Circuit Breaker Amazon Video can now stream in 4K on Xbox One S View all stories in Tech Loading comments...
