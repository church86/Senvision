Altogether, the utility is working on projects that total $128 million in Potomac Edison’s service area. To date, more than $67 million of the total has been spent on a variety of projects, including transmission enhancements to reinforce the system and support economic growth, constructing new distribution circuits, and inspecting and replacing utility poles and underground cables. “These infrastructure enhancements are necessary to serve the influx of new residents and businesses to our Potomac Edison service territory,” James A. Sears Jr., vice president of Potomac Edison, said in a statement. “At the same time, we also are working on projects designed to help enhance the day-to-day service we provide our customers, such as replacing older underground cables and improving existing overhead facilities.” FirstEnergy, which will be providing electrical service to the new Procter & Gamble manufacturing plant near Martinsburg, West Virginia, is planning to spend about $4.6 million of the $9 million on engineering and site preparation in 2016. The project is scheduled for completion in 2017, and will ultimately include a new transmission substation and several power lines. The company will also spend $1 million to replace a transformer at a distribution substation near Charles Town, West Virginia, in addition to using another $7.4 million to replace the wire on three transmission lines to help reinforce the transmission system for about 75,000 customers in Jefferson and Berkeley counties. To the benefit of Potomac Edison customers in both West Virginia and Maryland, FirstEnergy will also spend $3.1 million to upgrade equipment on about 287 distribution circuits, as well as $2.1 million to inspect about 19,000 utility poles. FirstEnergy will also make an additional $4.6 million in upgrades in Frederick and Montgomery counties in Maryland. Another $12 million of the budgeted total will go toward transmission-related projects owned by the Trans-Allegheny Interstate Line Co., a FirstEnergy transmission affiliate.

Hamilton County needs legal self-help center Aftab Pureval 10:45 a.m. EDT August 15, 2016 Aftab Pureval (Photo: Provided) Aftab Pureval is the Democratic candidate for Hamilton County clerk of courts and an attorney at Procter & Gamble. There is nothing more fundamentally true in our country than that our courts should be the great equalizer – that no matter who you are, where you’re from, or how much money you have, you should be able to access justice. Unfortunately, in the real world, it doesn’t always work this way. If you can’t afford a lawyer, it is difficult to navigate a burdensome and bureaucratic court system to achieve what you need. The Franklin County court system and law students at The Ohio State University in Columbus are working to change that. Earlier this summer, the Franklin County Legal Self Help Center was launched to assist people who can’t afford attorneys with their legal needs. The center is staffed by law students and overseen by local attorneys. The center provides information and assistance to clients seeking information on where to go, what resources are available, what forms are required, and other administrative guidance in connection with proceedings before the court. The law students who work in the center provide information in key areas like landlord-tenant matters, expungements, consumer law issues, and other general division or small claims matters. If you need help in locating and using proper forms, understanding procedural requirements and eligibility questions, and drafting simple pleadings, you can go to the students who staff the center and get help with your case, so that you can get your issues resolved without having to pay for a lawyer. The idea for this center came out of a summit called Access to Justice that was hosted last year by the Supreme Court of Ohio and the Ohio State Bar Association. The Supreme Court and the Bar Association realized the significant impediments many people face in accessing our courts – and that these impediments often disproportionately impact the people who need the courts the most.  As the report concluded, “Access to justice is a cornerstone, a part of the foundation of a free and democratic society. When that foundation is weakened by limiting access to our justice system, then the very fabric of justice for all loses its reality for its citizens.” By launching this self-help center and giving all people the assistance to utilize our courts, Franklin County has made real progress toward ensuring that the courts are available for everyone. And we need to do that in Hamilton County. In Hamilton County, we already have some of the highest court fees in the state of Ohio, which prices people out of our courts. Add to that attorneys' fees that are often cost prohibitive and it’s no wonder that so many people believe justice is out of reach. By launching a self-help center to make it easier for citizens to figure out the forms they need and to get guidance on common areas of the law, we can ensure that in Hamilton County, there is no barrier to justice. And we are fortunate to have two terrific law schools – at the University of Cincinnati and Northern Kentucky University – within minutes of the courthouse Downtown. Their law students can gain practical experience working with real clients and provide an important benefit to our community. The purpose of our courts is to be the great leveler – the one place where everyone is equal. By launching a self-help center in Cincinnati, we’ll ensure that access to justice is available to all of us, not just some of us. 513 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 3 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://cin.ci/2bup9RR TOP VIDEOS Watch Google Home struggle to answer queries 1:34 Cole Swindell has ‘You Should be Here’ moment on CMA Awards red carpet 2:01 Cole Swindell talks about is favorite 30 seconds while on CMA Awards red carpet! 1:01 RaeLynn’s reaction to watching old clips from ‘The Voice’ is priceless! 0:50 What’s it like to be inducted into Country Music Hall of Fame?

By Vittorio Cretella In 2014, Mars Inc. acquired IAMS, EUKANUBA and NATURA from The Procter & Gamble Company (P&G) – a $1.2 billion carve-out acquisition that was critical to its Petcare division’s future success. As a century-old company and a leader in the consumer packaged goods industry, Mars has executed many acquisitions; yet not many compared to this. Ensuring a seamless transition of services and benefits for 1,000 new associates at 20 North American sites in 120 days – with no data errors and no interruption to the business – was no small task. So how did we succeed in executing a seamless integration (and the fastest close in P&G history)? As the dust has settled and we approach the two-year anniversary of this milestone, it’s clear to me that our experience holds important lessons that can be used to guide similar integrations across a variety of organizations. The single most important success factor was investing early in scalable systems. In fact, the bulk of the work that enabled the integration – notably our transition to a cloud-based email and collaboration suite and our adoption of a common global enterprise resource planning (ERP) platform – began as much as a decade before. If you consider the “must haves” for business continuity, getting paid and being able to communicate are the two basics – two of the areas where IT really has to deliver seamlessly. Transitioning our new colleagues from their P&G email addresses to Mars addresses was one of the first things we delivered as part of the transition, and it was possible because of a major transformation that we undertook in 2012, which included moving from an internally-hosted legacy infrastructure to a widely-used cloud-based email and collaboration suite. Adopting this platform gave us a more dynamic, scalable and easily-administered collaboration space, one that allowed us to stand up key repositories to create a “one-stop-shop” for benefits, company policies and other important information. Equally importantly, by going through the process of migrating 40,000+ Mars Associates to the new suite in 2012, our team gained invaluable experience and best practices – experience that gave us a template to use for the P&G acquisition two years later. End-to-end business processes Another early investment that paid dividends during the acquisition took place in the early 2000s, when we developed a common ERP platform for end-to-end business processes. Leveraging that platform to reflect standard best practices across our global Petcare business, we developed a common set of business-enabling tools – covering everything from HR and finance, to manufacturing and procurement – tailored to Mars’ compliance levels and operational needs. This template had been road-tested and put into place at each of our existing Petcare sites, so by the time the P&G acquisition happened, it wasn’t a question of “will this work?” or “what’s the best functionality?” but rather “how quickly can we execute our established process?” By making investments like these early on, we’ve been able to create an IT environment that is more nimble, flexible and responsive to major business changes. We see the potential of technology and data to solve our toughest challenges and seize our biggest opportunities, and we’re proud that IT has become a true partner to our colleagues across the business – becoming both a growth-enabler and a source of competitive advantage.

For 108-year-old GM, the Cruise deal instantly makes it a contender in autonomous transportation — not an insignificant move for an automaker with little software DNA. For 86-year-old Unilever, the DSC deal allows it to compete more effectively on a direct-to-consumer basis with its nemesis, Procter & Gamble, which owns the shaving giant Gillette. Unilever HQ in Rotterdam, Netherlands. If the buyers had been Silicon Valley companies, these deals would be less remarkable. Instead, we find two “traditional” consumer product companies paying Silicon Valley prices for startups. And, of course, the buying streak continued with the purchase of Jet.com by Walmart for $3.3 billion, of which $3 billion is cash consideration. Will we see more old-line consumer businesses buying their way into innovation in the coming years? I think so. Examining the resources of those companies, it becomes evident that more deals of this type are possible, and, in fact, quite likely. I pulled public company data from the Fortune 500 list of the largest companies in the U.S. and filtered for categories like consumer goods, services and logistics. I then removed any companies with less than $1 billion of cash on the balance sheet, because startups are unlikely to take public company stock in a slower growing business in lieu of cold, hard cash. The chart below shows the cash balance and growth rate of the 31 remaining companies: Source: Public company filings via Sentieo and Yahoo Finance (7/30/2016). These companies have $133 billion of cash in total, with a median of $2.4 billion. Nine of these have greater than $5 billion of cash on hand:  Coca-Cola (KO), Procter & Gamble (PG), Pepsi (PEP), Walmart (WMT), UPS (UPS), Costco (COST), Nike (NKE) Disney (DIS) and Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA). To buy a company for $1 billion, these companies would spend less than 20 percent of their cash on hand. (Walmart spent more than one-third of its $8.7 billion of cash to buy Jet, so perhaps the list should be even longer!) Furthermore, their growth rates are anemic. The group’s median growth rate is 2.6 percent annually, which is a little more than double the rate of inflation and roughly one-seventh that of the “five tech horsemen”: Facebook (FB), Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL). Nearly all the growth in the consumer space is therefore being fueled by software. It stands to reason that many of these 31 companies are thinking about what their software strategy is, or how they can use the internet to form more direct relationships with their customers. In the future, there may be a fuzzier line between a “consumer products” company and a “consumer technology” company. Related Articles What this year's M&A activity tells us about media and entertainment Why did Unilever pay $1B for Dollar Shave Club?   GM buys self-driving car kit startup Cruise, plans to use tech to make driverless cars Making that transition should be a scary proposition to many of these old-line businesses. It requires new products, fresh talent and the willingness to take risks and make big investments. Yet, the cash is there  —  $133 billion of it, to be precise. Using it to buy one’s way into the future doesn’t seem like a crazy idea. Of course, the cynical finance student in me knows that these deals are notoriously difficult to execute for large, slow-growing companies. GM trades at 0.66x its $158 billion in annual revenues, so it has two problems. First, almost any tech acquisition will be dilutive to its share price , which Wall Street hates. Second, to add even a percentage point to GM’s growth rate would require it to contribute $1.6 billion of new revenue from its target. Both of these problems seem intractable to a finance wonk analyzing the deal, and yet GM was able to pull off the Cruise deal. No doubt some very senior managers at GM had to put significant credibility on the line to get this deal done. Not every legacy consumer company will have the conviction that GM, Unilever or Walmart had in recent months, but some will. If you’re considering the M&A path for your company, my advice would be to start developing senior relationships at a number of these non-traditional acquirers today. You might be educating them about what the future could be like, but in a more capital-constrained environment like 2016, these players have the cash and motivation to make a deal happen. And, now a precedent exists.

She is the new Crest and Orgullosa ambassador. “My motto in life is to embrace every moment. This is such an exciting time for me and I’m so proud, Orgullosa, to be a Crest athlete,” Hernandez said in a statement. Hernandez’s mother, Wanda Hernandez, also joined the “Thank You Mom” campaign that has been ongoing throughout the Olympic season. The teenager, who is of Puerto Rican descent, is the first U.S. born Latina to be on the Olympic gymnastics team since 1984. She is also the youngest of the Final Five, who won the team gold medal in Brazil last week. “When you’re given the opportunity of a lifetime to perform on the world’s biggest stage, smiling with confidence for your family and supporters is part of every routine,” she added in her statement. “As I prep for the competition, I always count on Crest products to keep my smile radiant and flawless on and off the mat." Crest’s Orgullosa campaign is an online platform that was created to celebrate and empower Latinas. The initiative, which uses the Spanish word for “proud” as its title, will look to spotlight personal stories of the Hernandez family and the pride in their culture, traditions, and family. Procter and Gamble said they selected Hernandez as their newest ambassador because she represents a new wave of Latinas who are reshaping the face of America with orgullo (pride). “Olympian Laurie Hernandez has inspired people around the world through her talent, personality and amazing smile. We welcome Laurie to the P&G family and we’re so proud to support her as a role model for the strength and power of Latinas and their families,” said Marc Pritchard, P&G Chief Brand Officer, in a statement. Shade acknowledged that the gymnast has a strong (and growing) fan base within the Hispanic community in United States. She told Quarks that they will look to tap into Hernandez’s growing fame, not unlike other breakout Olympic stars, and keep her in the public eye through the end of the year. “After a big Olympics like this, for any athlete, those first few months you’ve got to let them put their hair down a bit and enjoy all that’s out there,” said Shade. After the Olympics, Hernandez’s goal is to qualify for the world gymnastics championships next year. In 2020, she hopes to earn a spot on the U.S. Olympic team again.

Peltz Los Angeles Times LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story When the Summer Olympics end Sunday, the clock starts ticking for medal winners hoping to cash in on their glory. Other than established multimillionaire stars such as U.S. swimmer Michael Phelps and Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt, the Olympians have a brief window of opportunity – most likely a few weeks – to sign potentially lucrative endorsement deals once the Games are over. A handful might profit handsomely, notably gymnast Simone Biles, who arrived in Rio de Janeiro with endorsements already in hand and then captured the nation’s attention by winning four gold medals and one bronze. But most medalists won’t get rich from their efforts because corporations looking for celebrity endorsers know that the athletes – and their Olympic sports held only once every four years – don’t maintain the attention paid to traditional sports such as football and baseball, experts said. “Very few of them” will attain significant wealth from the Rio Games, said Ben Sturner, chief executive of Leverage Agency, a sports and entertainment marketing firm. “The news media will not be covering you three or four weeks from now.” That’s especially true with the Summer Olympics, said Matt Delzell, managing director at the Marketing Arm, a sports marketing agency. “The shelf life is so short for Summer Olympians because the timing is so bad,” he said. “We’re two weeks away from college football and the NFL, and the Major League Baseball playoffs are soon, so it’s a terrible time for the Olympic athletes to make hay in the spotlight. “Most marketers know that Katie Ledecky’s name, come January, sadly is going to be a whole lot lesser known than it is now,” even though the swimmer captured four gold medals in Brazil, Delzell said. It’s a moot point at the moment for Ledecky, who has opted to attend college and maintain her amateur status. But Biles – a three-time world champion – and others chose to turn professional, with Biles dropping plans to attend UCLA. Biles, 19, had inked endorsement deals before the Olympics began, including a television commercial for Procter & Gamble Co.’s Tide detergent that ran during the games, and her net worth already tops $2 million, according to MoneyNation.com. Biles and four other athletes also have been on the front and back covers of various Kellogg Co. cereal boxes since mid-June, extending the decades-old tradition of Olympic athletes being featured on cereal boxes. But for most Olympians, “it’s just tough” to land sponsorship deals, not only because they’re no longer on television but also because they’re less likely to maintain the buzz on social media that advertisers now crave, said Matt Balvanz, vice president for analytics at Navigate Research. “What are the social-media conversations about these athletes and how soon do they fall off? Two weeks out, no one will be talking about them,” Balvanz said. None of the medal winners in Rio returns home empty handed, however. The United States Olympic Committee pays bonuses – $25,000 for each gold medal, $15,000 for silver and $10,000 for bronze – that can be accepted by amateur students such as Ledecky under NCAA rules. Certain sports federations also pay bonuses to American medal winners. The USA Wrestling Foundation, for instance, is handing out a sizable $250,000 for gold medalists in Rio, along with $50,000 for silver and $25,000 for bronze. The Olympic gold medals themselves, which are 85 millimeters in diameter and weigh 500 grams, are valued at about $564 apiece, based on the recent price of gold, according to Forbes. That’s well below the record price of $708 for the 2012 Olympics in London, when gold and silver prices were higher. Each gold medal, produced by the Mint of Brazil, actually is mostly made of silver and plated with six grams of gold. If the entire medal was made of gold, it would be valued at nearly $22,000. That’s still small change compared with a multimillion-dollar shoe or apparel contract that a select few, such as Phelps, have been able to command. But this year, “is anybody going to make seven-figure endorsements from these Olympics? I doubt it,” Delzell said. Phelps reportedly has a net worth of $55 million, and Bolt’s reportedly tops $60 million, in good part because they’ve had long, superlative careers spanning more than one Olympics. That’s kept them relevant with consumers, analysts said. Yet even if other athletes don’t hit the endorsement jackpot immediately after these Olympics, they can still build a career from their momentary brilliance at the Games, said Rob Prazmark, chief executive of 21 Sports & Entertainment Market Group. Some Olympic athletes find ways to stay in the public’s eye – and thus relevant for endorsements from corporations – by appearing on TV shows, making public appearances or joining the broadcasting field. “Dancing with the Stars,” for instance, has become a destination for former Olympians such as soccer player Hope Solo, figure skater Kristi Yamaguchi and speed skater Apolo Anton Ohno. “Don’t measure it by how much money they make this year,” Prazmark said. “Their value as an Olympian doesn’t end after they win gold, it’s how they work their Olympic achievements. You don’t have to be Michael Phelps to make a career out of being an Olympian.” Related content LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Business Comments Videos facebook twitter email Share More Videos 0:48 Thief caught on camera after stealing woman's purse Pause 1:20 In train vs. tow truck, the train wins 2:17 Adam Beasley recaps the Dolphins victory over the Rams 0:58 New trolley route in Miami Beach 0:33 Adam Gase talks about focusing on positives, after victory over Rams 1:04 Ryan Tannehill talks about team coming together to defeat the Rams 2:02 Repo man felt bad taking elderly couple's car.

Published on August 08, 2016. Vaughan Emsley. Credit: Tongal Most Popular Tongal, the creative crowdsourcing firm that's been threatening to become the Uber of advertising for about as long as Uber has been around, has landed Saatchi & Saatchi's longtime lead Procter & Gamble Co. executive to broaden its reach with big clients. Vaughan Emsley, who handled key P&G brands for Saatchi during most of the past three decades, has joined Tongal as head of strategy and client development. He was most recently a strategic advisor to Saatchi, and before that global head of planning and transformation from 2013 to 2015. He was Saatchi's exec VP in charge of the global P&G account from 2005 to 2013. Mr. Emsley had been consulting for Tongal the past six months, already creating some buzz among marketers who knew him from P&G days, prior to coming on board as a full-time employee. The company counts P&G, Unilever, Johnson & Johnson, Colgate-Palmolive Co., Walmart's Sam's Club and other big players as clients on projects, and Mr. Emsley's appointment is about expanding such work, said Tongal co-founder and CEO Rob Salvatore. Mr. Emsley said the decision to join Tongal started really with "a health crisis" two years ago. "When I came back to work, I decided I wanted to do something very different than I'd been doing before," he said. "It took quite a while for me to find what that was going to be. One of the reasons I settled with Tongal is that I was looking at the way technology was disrupting so many businesses – be it financial trading, hotels or car hire. The question in my mind is 'Why should the communication business be immune?'" Working at Tongal actually reminds him of what the agency business was like 30 years ago, Mr. Emsley said. "That spirit has gone out of the agencies somewhat over the past 10 years or so, and I found it here. That, more than anything else, told me this has a great future." Mr. Emsley is one of about 50 employees for Tongal, founded in 2009 (the same year as Uber) and now with revenue of more than $30 million based on work of more than 120,000 "Tongalers," a combination of individual creatives and often multi-employee production houses. Mr. Salvatore expects the client-service team to grow under Mr. Emsley. "This is a very significant hire for us," he said. And while Tongal's work is now weighted more heavily toward production, Mr. Salvatore sees growth come from developing creative ideas behind the work. "Cost is only a component of it," Mr. Salvatore said. "It's the brands needing a solution that's not there. They need more content, but it needs to be authentic, relevant, targeted to the audience in the specific platform it's hosted on." The idea behind Tongal is really that "channels are diffusing toward infinite, and the shelf life is also compressing, so you're going to need a distributed workforce to do it," Mr. Salvatore said. "Our underlying thesis is that creativity is abundant and can be deployed efficiently to solve that problem." Asked if, as an agency executive, he was concerned by the competitive threat Tongal poses, Mr. Emsley said, "Yes, I would have been concerned in those days." He'll split time between New York and Tongal's Santa Monica Calif. office, where most of its employees are. Some other account management people are based closer to clients in the Midwest. "There is a huge opportunity for Tongal to become a strategic partner for clients," Mr. Emsley said. "If you combine strategic thinking with the scale of creative resources that Tongal has, and the speed and agility with which is moves, you've got a solution to the problems that many clients have had."

MUMBAI: Retention of women employees in the workforce will improve with the passage of the Maternity Benefit Amendment Bill in Rajya Sabha. The bill will more than double paid maternity leave to 26 weeks from 12 weeks. In India, the percentage of women in the workforce declines from 25% at entry level to 16% at mid-level and 4% at top levels. With the amendments identifying the need to allocate additional time to women for child rearing, experts believe this will bring down attrition levels. Saundarya Rajesh, founder-president of Avtar Group, a leading talent strategy and diversity consulting firms, said, "This will prevent at least 20% of regretted attrition of women in the age group of 25 to 35, being faced by organizations." Many progressive companies like Hindustan Unilever (HUL), Flipkart, HCL Technologies, PwC, Accenture, Procter & Gamble (P&G), Godrej and Tata Group voluntarily offer around 6 months of paid maternity leave to employees. The objective is to enhance gender diversity levels. N S Rajan, group executive council member & group chief HR officer, Tata Sons, said, "Our goal is to have 2,30,000 women employees by 2020. We are not just talking of compliance around gender diversity, or a mandate which needs adherence. We are talking of a group-wide commitment to celebrating the importance of gender diversity. Our endeavour is to remove hurdles in the way of career growth of women — be it unconscious bias or policy shortfalls." In fact, most companies offer more than the stipulated requirement. At PwC, in case of any medical exigency, an additional four weeks of leave is offered. "We have had examples in our office where women employees, even in client-facing roles, have worked from home for six months at a stretch and have still met all their deliverables," said Jagjit Singh, chief people officer, PwC India. Sonali Roychowdhury, head (HR), P&G India, said, "On top of the maternity leave, employees also have an option of adding an additional six weeks of paid vacation leave." B P Biddappa, executive director (HR), HUL, said, "It will enable women across India to integrate their personal and professional aspirations. I believe this amendment will help drive family-friendly policies that help women build seamless and satisfying careers." Prince Augustin, EVP (group human capital & leadership development), Mahindra & Mahindra, said the company is geared for the stipulated leave as it had recently enhanced its leave beyond the one provided under the Act. The company has also put a 'work out of home' policy in place. However, despite the best efforts, statistics reveal that more than 25% of Indian women in the private sector opt out of their career after child birth. "I'm sure this will facilitate the return of some very capable women back into the corporate corridors after their maternity break," said Sumit Mitra, head (HR and corporate services), Godrej Industries and associate companies. A major concern, however, is regarding the status quo on parental laws. "The government should have revised parental laws to weed out inherent biases. By not doing so, the message that is going out is 'child rearing is a woman's job alone'," said Rituparna Chakraborty, co-founder & senior VP of TeamLease Services. Another concern is whether the move could be counter-productive with smaller enterprises becoming wary of hiring women. "Only a grand total of 25.5% of all employable women are in the workforce. They would range in the age group of 25 to 60. Of this group, a policy such as this will address itself to about 35% of the leave needs of the population. This shrinks the total number of beneficiaries to a rather small number. On the other hand, if the government were to encourage companies to hire more women by providing incentives for such hiring (a la Japan, which actually gives tax rebates for the hiring of second-career women), you might find the number of 25.5% jumping up by about 10 percentage points," said Rajesh. An NSSO report shows that close to 38% of women who are currently in the workforce are employed by small and medium enterprises.

Recover your password Delimiter About Delimiter Contact us Ethics Principles Privacy Site Terms Comments policy Enterprise IT News Qantas CIO jets off to Airbus By Daniel Palmer - 16/08/2016 0 news Qantas Airways’ Chief Information Officer, Luc Hennekens, is leaving the company to take on the same role at Airbus, effective 1 October. The move follows the departure of Guus Dekkers, currently CIO with Airbus and Airbus Group, who is leaving the company at the end of September, Airbus said. Qantas has previously indicated that Dekkers is leaving the role to be closer to his family, as well as to pursue an opportunity at a major company based in France. In his new role, Hennekens will be reporting to Marc Fontaine, Group Digital Transformation Officer, for Airbus Group matters, and to Tom Williams, Chief Operations Officer Airbus, for Airbus matters. Hennekens studied industrial engineering at Eindhoven University of Technology before later moving into IT. Prior to joining Qantas, he held positions at Procter & Gamble and Hewlett-Packard among others. As well as being responsible for Airbus’ IT systems, the incoming CIO will have responsibility for digital solutions for the company’s products, information and communication systems, protection against cyberattacks and more. Airbus said that, in his years with the group, Guus Dekkers and his team achieved “impressive results” in improving the company’s previously “very fragmented” IT structure. He is further credited with enabling an “efficient” design and manufacturing process at Airbus, which led to his being awarded the title of CIO of the Year in 2013 by German magazines Computerwoche and CIO-Magazin. More recently, Dekkers was behind the setting up of “one of the world’s largest high-performance computing environments”, Airbus said, and has rolled out cross divisional platforms for digital initiatives such as Big Data, cloud services, Internet of Things, 3D printing and augmented reality. “I regret Guus’ decision [to leave], but fully respect it,” said Airbus Group CEO Tom Enders. “He has been at the helm of our Information & Communication Technology function since he joined the company in 2008.” “Guus has been a pillar for the further integration of IT and communication within Airbus Group as a key business enabler,” Enders continued. “I would like to thank him for his great contribution and strong engagement during his career within the company and I wish him all the best for his professional and personal future.” Discussing the appointment of Hennekens as CIO, the CEO said: “Luc brings extensive experience from different industries in IT and transformation across the globe. During his assignment at Qantas, Luc was at the heart of digitisation and Big Data deployment in various innovative fields, for example passenger experience or performance of aircraft.” Image credit: Airbus Related posts: Qantas CIO jets off to France CIO Paul Jones flies to Qantas from Mars Qantas tech chief becomes Jetstar CEO Dumped Qantas CIO finds Leighton home Stephen Wilson leaves Qantas TAGS airbus chief information officer cio executive appointment it management qantas SHARE tweet Daniel Palmer Popular articles in Delimiter's last year 397NBN to boost HFC broadband with DOCSIS 3.1 in 2017 329Fifield invites Australians to comment: Who has the better NBN? 276Analysis by ex-NBN CTO shows NBN activation rate is actually slowing 272Cox is rolling out gigabit broadband across its US markets 271Fact check: Turnbull misleads Q&A audience on NBN 262Google Fiber shows people don’t want FTTP, says Morrow 255NZ brings FTTP costs down to FTTN levels 237The election is over, and Fibre to the Node is here to stay 232XG.FAST won’t obviate need for copper replacement, says Internet Australia 230NBN election: Labor polling voters on Coalition’s NBN performance 228NBN says customers just as happy with FTTN or FTTP 221Labor needs “a good explanation” to change NBN, says Morrow 220Move to FTTP viable but threatened by NBN monopoly, says Budde 218NBN raises possibility of multi-gigabit symmetric HFC speeds 214Read in full: Mike Quigley launches devastating critique of MTM policy 209IPA publishes anti-Labor NBN attack riddled with grievous errors 205“Fibre witch-hunt”: Budde says MTM defenders getting “desperate” 201BT FTTN network hits 25 million premises milestone 194NBN changes mind again: Some HFC suburbs to get FTTN after all 193NBN gridlock: Peak hour congestion takes down FTTN for some 192NBN G.Fast “more hype than reality”, says Budde 191The Australian newspaper launches election attack on Labor’s NBN 188For the tragedy of the NBN, Turnbull must go 188NBN statement not Coalition’s final NBN policy Policy and politics Labor slams Turnbull’s NBN “broken promises”2 months ago Stephen Conroy announces retirement from Senate2 months ago Labor colleagues pay tribute to “visionary” Conroy2 months ago Ludlam demands clarity on GST Internet filter report2 months ago Labor backs Govt’s new Joint NBN Committee2 months ago Enterprise IT [ad] Accelerating to real-time: The challenges ahead for banking transformation2 weeks ago Origin searches for Head of Cloud Services2 months ago IoT solution brings a boost to Tasmania’s oyster farms2 months ago ANZ Bank renews Optus telco deals2 months ago Programming error costs CommBank over $2.5m2 months ago IT Industry AirTree raises $250m for venture capital fund2 months ago HP adopts Microsoft Dynamics for CRM2 months ago Digital tech “critical” for massive agricultural industry growth2 months ago Simon Hackett appointed CEO of Redflow3 months ago Salesforce best place to work in Australia, survey finds3 months ago ABOUT USWelcome!

Maurice Levy Credit: Christian Alminana/Courtesy of Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity Most Popular Publicis Groupe chairman and CEO Maurice Lévy confirmed that his successor will be announced some time between December 2016 and February 2017, ahead of the French communications group's annual general meeting, which will take place in Paris in May. Speaking to analysts at Publicis Groupe's 2016 first half results presentation, Mr. Lévy added, "for the time being we are working only on internal candidates." The internal candidate everyone is watching is Arthur Sadoun, who was elevated to CEO of the Publicis Worldwide network in mid-2013 and put in charge of all the creative networks as CEO of the new Publicis Communications in a major Publicis Groupe re-org at the end of 2015. Apart from Mr. Sadoun's closely-watched tryout in key roles for Mr. Levy's job, it's unclear if any other internal candidates are being seriously considered. In an interview later with Ad Age, Mr. Levy said: "The board will start to work seriously on it as soon as September and make their decision at the end of this year, or the beginning of the next. It's the most important task the board has. Obviously they have already done a lot of background work, but it takes time. I'm not a member of the advisory board. I am there just as support. I can shed light on some situations and bring the coffee." Publicis Groupe reported organic growth (excluding acquisitions and currency swings) of 2.7% for the second quarter of the year, with revenues of $2.7 billion. Revenues for the first half of the year were $5.3 billion, up 4.6% on the first half of 2015. North America's organic growth rate was -0.1% in the second quarter, after the region was hit hard by last year's media losses. "We are working hard to mitigate the impact and to improve the situation," Mr. Lévy said. During the spate of 2015 media account reviews, Publicis Groupe lost its massive Coca-Cola account, and lost its longstanding Procter & Gamble multibillion-dollar media business to rival Omnicom Group. Related Stories Publicis Groupe Creates New Entity for Walmart to Handle U.S. Creative, In-Store Marketing Publicis Groupe Grows 2.9% in First Quarter, but Levy Warns on Second and Third Publicis' Mediavest lost the Walmart media account in February, but the group has been working to strengthen its non-media relationship with the retailer this year, and recently created a new entity to house Walmart's U.S. creative and in-store advertising, as well as some non-advertising duties including technology and corporate reputation. "We will feel the full impact of the losses in North America in the third and fourth quarters," Mr. Levy told Ad Age. "For example, the P&G loss will impact only from July 1." Publicis Groupe's Saatchi & Saatchi won Walmart-owned Asda's $145 million U.K. business without a pitch in April. And earlier this month Publicis Groupe and Walmart began creating a new entity to house the retailer's U.S. creative and in-store advertising, along with other pieces of business that do not involve advertising. "What we have to do is develop an even more collaborative approach between agencies and work with the Power of One concept big time," Mr. Levy added. "We've had a few wins and we will feel the benefit from the big Walmart [account] as soon as the fall. I'm confident the situation in the U.S. will be recovered pretty quickly. Next year we will benefit from all our efforts and the work we have done." Saatchi & Saatchi was also this week named as one of GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare's two largest global communications partners, alongside WPP's Grey Worldwide. The consumer healthcare giant reviewed its business following a merger with Novartis Consumer Health, with which Saatchi & Saatchi had an existing relationship. Publicis Groupe, whose agencies include Leo Burnett, Saatchi & Saatchi, Bartle Bogle Hegarty, StarcomMediaVest and Zenithoptimedia, saw its second quarter results boosted by a strong performance in Europe, where organic growth reached 7.3% in the second quarter, and 5.5% for the first half of the year. For the second half of the year, digital growth in the region was 12.5%, while Germany and Italy both grew around 9%. Mr. Lévy spoke on the call with analysts about the impact of last month's shock Brexit decision, when the U.K. voted in a referendum to leave the European Union. "We are in 'terra incognita' because nobody knows exactly what will happen. We know that there is not a clear plan ... There is a blank sheet of paper and we have to build a solution, " he said. "After the emotion, I believe that everyone will work extremely positively toward the future … and Europe will be much stronger and more united … and the U.K. will have to find a way to leave the EU." "We believe that if there is a deterioration it will come very progressively and it will not be a sharp decrease of any indicator ... It is not impossible that at the end of the day things will remain relatively stable." (And Europeans will continue to take their traditional August vacations; Mr. Levy leaves in 10 days for his own summer break, in Provence and then trekking in the mountains.) In Asia Pacific, organic growth was 5.5% in the second quarter. In Latin America, it reached 4.8% and in Middle East & Africa it was down -1.5%. Digital growth across the group in the first half of the year was 6.3%, reaching 23% in Asia Pacific, 12.5% in Europe and 10.7% in the Middle East and Africa. Latin America, at 0.9%, was the only region to show any analog growth, with analog across the group down by -0.8%.

At 12:16 IST, the barometer index, the S&P BSE Sensex, was up 135.73 points or 0.48% at 28,141.10. The gains for the Nifty 50 index were higher in percentage terms than those for the Sensex. The Nifty was currently up 49.75 points or 0.58% at 8,673.80. The market sentiment was positive after the minutes of the latest US Federal Reserve meeting showed policymakers were in no rush to raise interest rates. The Sensex rose 208.80 points, or 0.75% at the day's high of 28,214.17 in mid-morning trade, its highest level since 9 August 2016. The index rose 71.63 points, or 0.26% at the day's low of 28,077 in early trade. The Nifty rose 66.65 points, or 0.77% at the day's high of 8,690.70 in mid-morning trade, its highest level since 9 August 2016. The index rose 21 points, or 0.24% at the day's low of 8,645.05 in early trade. The broad market depicted strength. There were nearly two gainers against every loser on BSE. 1,550 shares rose and 795 shares fell. A total of 155 shares were unchanged. The BSE Mid-Cap index was currently up 0.46%, underperforming the Sensex. The BSE Small-Cap index was currently up 0.89%, outperforming the Sensex. In overseas stock markets, Asian stocks were mixed after minutes of the US Federal Reserve's latest meeting showed policymakers were in no rush to raise interest rates. US stocks closed slightly higher yesterday, 17 August 2016, sharply paring earlier losses, as minutes from the Federal Reserve's July meeting showed policy makers remain divided on prospects for a near-term rate increase. Stocks bounced off session lows after St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said that with US growth trending below 2%, interest rates can stay low. Most FMCG shares edged higher. Procter & Gamble Hygiene & Health Care (up 1.47%), Tata Global Beverages (up 0.80%), Dabur India (up 0.51%), Colgate Palmolive (India) (up 0.29%), Nestle India (up 0.27%), Bajaj Corp (up 0.19%), Godrej Consumer Products (up 0.11%) and Marico (up 0.08%), edged higher. Jyothy Laboratories (down 0.04%), GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare (down 0.42%), Hindustan Unilever (down 0.51%) and Britannia Industries (down 0.69%), edged lower.

Shares of state-run power transmission major Power Grid Corporation of India were up 3.04% at Rs 179.85. The company said in an investor presentation on the first quarter results submitted to the stock exchanges that it is implementing projects worth about Rs 1.13 lakh crore (as of July 2016). It has identified new projects worth about Rs 15000 crore. The total works in hand is about Rs 1.44 lakh crore. Reliance Industries (RIL) was up 0.4% at Rs 1,018.05. With reference to news item suggesting that the oil ministry slapped $250 million profit petroleum penalty on RIL, the company clarified during market hours today, 18 August 2016, that the issue is an ongoing dispute on disallowance of cost recovery by the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas (MoPNG). The dispute started in 2011 and is currently under arbitration in accordance with provisions of the Production Sharing Contract (PSC). The parties to arbitration are Contractor Group (RIL, BP and NIKO) and Government of India (through MoPNG). Every year, based on its own interpretations of the PSC and assumptions (with which the Contractor Group does not agree), MoPNG revises the total cost it proposes to disallow and consequently aggregates the figure with the figures of the previous years. It also demands additional profit petroleum (in total including previous year claims as well) as GoI share. Upto financial year 2013-2014, the cost recovery proposed to be disallowed was $2.376 billion and consequent demand of Government of India (GoI) share of additional profit petroleum of $195.3 million on cumulative basis. On 3 June 2016, the company received a revised claim upto year 2014-2015 with a disallowance of $2.756 billion on cumulative basis and consequent demand of GoI share of additional profit petroleum of $246.90 million, also on cumulative basis. The number mentioned in the headline of the news item is a cumulative figure since commencement of the dispute. RIL also clarified that GoI has already collected gross $81.7 million in Gas Pool Account, towards the aforesaid claim. RIL reiterated that all claims made by GoI are denied by the Contractor Group and currently part of an ongoing arbitration. Maruti Suzuki India rose 0.94% to Rs 4,936.65 on reports that a domestic brokerage has upgraded its rating on the stock to buy from add with target price of Rs 5,800 per share. The brokerage reportedly said that Maruti Suzuki India (Maruti) is miles ahead of competition amongst peers. The brokerage sees early signs of improvement in pricing for Maruti. It further added that Maruti is well placed to gain market share and recovery in demand will result in pricing power. Indian Bank jumped 5.37% to Rs 228.65 after a bulk deal of 10.18 lakh shares was executed on the scrip at Rs 225.50 per share at 09:41 IST on BSE.

It’s even harder to lose gracefully. Take the U.S. women’s soccer team: After their tough loss last week to Sweden in the quarterfinals at the Rio Olympics, the women were crushed. “We were initially shocked, disappointed, hurt and heartbroken,” team forward Alex Morgan tells PEOPLE. “It was like a bad dream. It was just crushing.” But since that shocking loss, Morgan says she has taken a more philosophical approach to her disappointment. The 27-year-old sat down with PEOPLE at the P&> Family Home in Rio, a sanctuary that supports athletes and their families throughout the games. “It was horrible, but I do feel like I learned a lot more from losing than from winning,” Morgan says. “I was able to pick myself up, which is so important to do after a game. I feel like the next time we win, it will be that much sweeter because we know what it feels like to lose.” “Obviously, it was really hard,” she says. “But winning and losing isn’t everything; sometimes, the journey is just as important as the outcome.” For more of PEOPLE’s Olympic coverage, pick up our collector’s edition, The Best of the Games, on sale now. Despite controversial anti-Sweden comments from teammate Hope Solo, Morgan has a different approach to losing. “I saw her comments, but I feel like those are opinions I don’t share,” she told USA Today. “I think it’s important to keep things positive,” Morgan tells PEOPLE. “Sometimes you don’t win, and that sucks, and you work on improving.” WATCH: Soccer Superstar Alex Morgan Reveals How Sports Changed Her Life Alex Morgan Maddie Meyer Playing ‘Like A Girl’ With her Rio journey behind her, Morgan is hoping to be a role model to younger women. She has teamed up with Always for the #LikeAGirl campaign, which encourages girls to play sports. “Whenever people say ‘women’s soccer,’ I want to correct them to say ‘soccer.’ ” Morgan says. “Every girl has had their sport diminished because they’re girls.” The purpose of the campaign is to educate girls and young women about their sports options as they reach puberty and beyond. For Morgan, the campaign is working. “The attitudes have definitely shifted,” she says. “When people say, ‘You run like a girl, you play like a girl,’ it’s not what it used to be. “That shouldn’t be negative. You should be proud to play like a girl. We’re shifting the way people think about us.” Show Full Article See Also More People Logo Homeless, Track-Running Brooklyn Sisters are Sport's Illustrated Kids' SportsKids of the Year Steph Curry Trades Autographed Jerseys with 7-Year-Old with Leukemia: ‘This Is His Wish’ Gabby Douglas Reflects On Her Rio Critics: ‘It Didn’t Ruin My Experience, But It Made It Harder’ Cubs Slugger Anthony Rizzo Sends Signed Jersey to Family Who Adopted ‘Rizzo the Dog’ Kate Upton Gets Salty on Twitter After Fiancé Justin Verlander Loses Cy Young Award Load More Stories Most Popular 1 Khloé Kardashian Joins Boyfriend Tristan Thompson for Hometown Turkey Drive Ahead of Thanksgiving 2 Homeless, Track-Running Brooklyn Sisters are Sport's Illustrated Kids' SportsKids of the Year 3 Nicole Johnson Phelps Wants Another Baby with Husband Michael: 'Of Course We Have Plans!' 4 Dennis Rodman Charged with Hit-and-Run After Freeway Incident 5 Steph Curry Trades Autographed Jerseys with 7-Year-Old with Leukemia: ‘This Is His Wish’ See Also People Facebook Tumblr Instagram Pinterest YouTube Google+ Copyright © 2016 Time Inc.

The lock that opened the gates to an empire How the Godrej Group channelled the swadeshi spirit at home, and then went global In 1989, when the vestiges of the licence raj era still wove reams of red tape around Indian businesses, a management trainee at Godrej GE Appliances’ Faridabad office faced a dilemma. An excise tax collector wanted a Diwali “gift” delivered at his residence. “Or else…” After discussions with his seniors, the trainee turned up at the official’s house the next day with a gift-wrapped box. At the visitor’s insistence, the official unwrapped it, to find a pack of Godrej soaps in various fragrances. The unspoken but clear message: “The Godrej group is committed to ethical business. Don’t expect anything else from us.” The anecdote, narrated by Ranganatha Thota, the management trainee at that time, sums up an idea that Gurcharan Das, former CEO of Procter & Gamble India, has articulated: while India secured political independence in 1947, it got economic independence only with the 1991 reforms. In many ways, the business history of the Godrej Group, which dates back to 1897, mirrors the Independence movement. The group’s founder Ardeshir Godrej, as the Godrej Rhyme (at right) narrates and as BK Karanjia chronicles in his two-volume book Godrej: A hundred years 1897-1997, left India for Africa in 1889 to practise law. But unwilling to commit perjury to advance his career, he returned home, where the freedom movement was gathering pace, with the birth of the Indian National Congress in 1885.Swadeshi advocate Upon returning to India, Ardeshir became an early proponent of the swadeshi idea of economic self-reliance. An early venture to manufacture medical equipment failed owing to British protectionism, but the indefatigable entrepreneur cast his eye on lowly locks. The lock business was in the control of British and American manufacturers, but Ardeshir found a flaw in their products: their springs, used to work the levers, often gave way. Borrowing money to set up a shed in Lalbaug in Mumbai in 1897, he began making Anchor locks, which didn’t have springs. They were well-received in the market. From that, he went on to manufacture safes, again exposing a chink in the foreign-made safes, which rendered them unreliable. He patented the door frame, double-plate doors, and lock-case, and sold his safes at half the price of foreign brands. So successful was this business that even the Queen, while on a tour of India in 1912, availed of the services of a Godrej safe. Ardeshir, who had a Renaissance spirit that was always looking for new realms to conquer, then began manufacturing soap with vegetable oil, out of consideration for Hindu sentiments that disfavoured the use of animal fat. His soaps soon secured celebrity endorsements from Rabindranath Tagore, Dr Annie Besant and C Rajagopalachari. Despite the heavily skewed business landscape that protected British business interests, Godrej products held their own against multinationals. By the time he died in 1936, Ardeshir had expanded Godrej’s businesses into new areas. That year, Godrej & Boyce and Godrej Soaps posted revenues of ₹12 lakh and ₹6 lakh respectively. Consolidation phase Ardeshir’s younger brother Pirojsha, who succeeded him, focussed on consolidation rather than expansion into new areas. By Independence, the Group’s revenues had grown five times to ₹90 lakh. In 1948, the company secured permission to construct its first manufacturing plant on a large parcel of land that Pirojsha had acquired in Vikhroli (in current-day Mumbai). What it manufactured first was not locks or safes, but secure ballot boxes for independent India’s first elections in 1952. To showcase Indian prowess in manufacturing — the original ‘Make in India’ campaign! — Godrej diversified into making typewriters in 1953. Only four of the 1,800 components were imported; even these were soon being made at home. At the Congress session at Avadi, in Madras, Jawaharlal Nehru stooped over a Godrej typewriter to tip-tap a few words, signalling India’s early success in industrialisation. Pirojsha then ventured into making refrigerators; in 1958, the first Indian fridge came with a ₹1,885 tag. Pirojsha got his three sons on board: Sohrabji to look into overall marketing of Godrej products, Burjorji to look after soaps, and Naval to look into typewriters, refrigerators and hi-tech electronics.Going global The 1960s were a decade of two wars, a drought, and rampant inflation. In 1963, in the midst of that crisis, Burjorji’s son Adi Godrej took over the soaps business, which then had a turnover of ₹2.43 crore. This was the decade when the Group gained global footprint. After a couple of falst starts, it secured a foothold in Malaysia and, later, Singapore. By the 1970s, exports to western Europe picked up. Pirojsha passed away in 1972; by then, the third generation of the Godrej family was in the saddle, with Naval’s son Jamshyd heading the steel business, while Adi took Godrej soaps to new heights. By 1975, the group’s exports touched ₹22 crore. Inspired by Japanese processes, it introduced the Godrej Management System, to improve productivity and reduce inventories. The dawn of the 1980s was marked by fierce competition with Hindustan Lever in the soaps segment. “We needed big ideas to take on the competition and for the first time a male protagonist was used to promote a soap brand,” recalls adman Sam Balsara, who handled the Cinthol account. The campaign in 1985 featured Vinod Khanna on horseback and, later, Imran Khan. Both proved phenomenal hits.Post-1991 phase When the gale force of economic reforms came sweeping in 1991, Godrej was poised for take-off. In the 25 years since, the Group has grown into a $4.5 billion (₹30,000 crore) conglomerate, with an impressive global footprint. These 25 years have also seen the Group experiment, unsuccessfully, with joint ventures with GE, P&G, Sara Lee, Pillsbury and Hershey. And in 2008, when the global financial crisis dragged down economies, the Group, now into its fourth-generation leadership under Adi’s daughter Tanya Dubash, underwent a rebranding exercise to extend the brand appeal to young customers. Looking ahead, the Group plans to stick to its growth target of “10x in 10 years” (See Interview), growing both organically and through acquisitions. Industry analysts feel the Group will deliver. “They truly walk the talk,” says Nilesh Shah, Managing Director, Kotak Mutual Fund. It’s been 119 years since Ardeshir, the low-profile Parsi gentleman, implanted the Godrej flag in the land that adopted his Guderz tribe (from which the family name derives) that fled from Iran. In this time, the Godrej Group has established itself not only as an entrepreneurial success, but as a business that runs on strong ethical foundations.

Stepan, Solvay News provided by Research and Markets Aug 17, 2016, 07:10 ET Share this article DUBLIN, August 17, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Research and Markets has announced the addition of the "Global Liquid Detergent Chemicals Market 2016-2020" report to their offering. The global liquid detergent chemicals market is forecast to grow at a CAGR of 4.73% during the period 2016-2020. Commenting on the report, an analyst from the research team said: Shift toward concentrated liquid detergent formulations will be a key trend for market growth. Water scarcity is a growing environmental concern across the world, with only about 0.01% of the total water available for immediate consumption. So, vendors of liquid detergents, such as P&G, Unilever, and Henkel, are focusing on introducing concentrated liquid detergents. Compared to standard liquid detergents that have an average water content of 65%-70%, concentrated formats contain only 5%-50% water. According to the report, high demand for fragrance will be a key driver for market growth. The scent of the product is one of the leading factors influencing the purchase of household detergents.

It may sound like science fiction but tech that identifies VIP shoppers could soon be used for customer loyalty schemes Facial recognition already enables brands to count how many people have viewed their ads. Photograph: Matthew Lloyd/Getty Images Supported by About this content Sean Hargrave Wednesday 17 August 2016 07.30 EDT Last modified on Thursday 20 October 2016 06.27 EDT Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close Whenever the future of advertising is discussed, thoughts often turn to the sci-fi image of a stalked Tom Cruise in Minority Report being recognised and served intrusive, personalised advertising as he tries to escape a futuristic city. Hence, recent claims by Russian app FindFace that it could identify people in public by their profile picture on a Russian social media site were met with a combination of awe and concern. Such facial recognition could enable digital screens to tailor messages to each individual as they pass, meaning an end to brands wasting budget advertising the wrong products to the wrong people. Facial recognition is already following celebrities’ pictures around online and providing advertising space next to them. Computer vision firm GumGum claims to be able to programme any face into its recognition system and then identifies it when it subsequently appears on the internet, even if there is no caption giving away the person’s identity. Typical customers are sponsors seeking to check up on what exposure a celebrity is earning them. “We’re currently working with P&G to recognise the athletes they’re using in their Thank You Mum Olympics campaign,” says GumGum managing director Ed Preedy. “We not only count how many pictures are posted of the athletes they work with, so they can see how much coverage they’ve attracted, but we can also let them serve an advert next to each picture.” Virtual reality: are you ready for surreal estate? Read more The VIP treatment Retailers are starting to see face recognition as a means of distinguishing their VIP customer loyalty schemes. At Axis, which develops facial recognition technology, business development manager Andy Martin points out facial recognition is already being used to enable advertisers to count how many people have viewed their outdoor advertising. The results are even split by gender and age. In a well-known outdoor campaign for domestic abuse charity Women’s Aid, a model’s bruises disappeared from her face as more people watched the screen, getting across the message that if people take notice, domestic violence could be halted. “Where I think we’ll start to move on and actually see people individually recognised is customer loyalty schemes,” says Martin. “We’re already working behind the scenes with some well-known retailers who are interested in spotting their loyal shoppers when they walk through the door. It would allow a sales assistant to be alerted and offer some a truly personalised shopping experience.” While customer loyalty might be the first opportunity, individual adverts, targeted through facial recognition, could be arriving sooner than you think. Robin Arnold, director at Digital Media Technologies, which consults on outdoor campaigns, has used camera technology in projects to enable digital posters to change when they are being watched. A recent example was a J20 advert in which an on-screen predator played a game of What’s the time Mr Wolf? with onlookers. He has also worked on campaigns where the technology was used to subtly personalise car adverts when an advertising screen’s camera spotted a driver of a rival brand. “The technology used number plate recognition software to find out what type of car [was] waiting at the lights and then changed the message on the digital screen,” he explains. “So, when the client was Renault they would spot a Citroën car and say something like, ‘Hey, Citroën driver, check out this Renault’. BMW used it to promote its X5 model when the system spotted people driving the equivalent Mercedes model.” The digital economy is outgrowing existing business ecosystems Read more Mood and gender targeting Will the next step in targeted advertising see brands recognise each person’s face and serve them a personalised message? Chris Pelekanou, commercial director at outdoor advertising company Clear Channel, reveals that experiments have been taking place to determine if adverts can be altered according to an onlooker’s mood. One recent public campaign from Plan International used a camera to deliver men and women different messages to underline the limited education choices for women in some countries. However, recognising each person would probably be a step too far. Facebook Twitter Pinterest A passerby looks at the M&C Saatchi Artificial Intelligence poster in Oxford Street London. Photograph: Laurence Gibson “You can’t do something just because the technology is there, you have to be led by the consumer and not the technology,” he says. “If we did start recognising people en masse then I think outdoor would have the same problem that digital display is having with people getting fed up and install ad blockers.” Social offers However, Andy Pringle, head of performance media at digital marketing agency Performics suggests that we are entering a period where we should think of marketing as “add-vertising”. Give a customer something extra and they may well give permission to be recognised. “It’s the kind of thing you can imagine being used in customer loyalty but also social media,” he says. “You can imagine brands asking people to give permission to be recognised in return for offers while they’re out and about. Say, there’s a guy waiting for a bus for ages in front of digital screen running a beer campaign. If that person likes that brand on Facebook you can foresee either the screen saying “hi” and giving him or her a voucher code for a free beer or triggering a voucher to be delivered to their Facebook inbox.” Too many faces, too many laws That kind of facial recognition is going to be far more likely than the sci-fi image of all advertising being individually tailored, according to Scott Ross, CTO at advertising agency DigitasLBi. He suggests those who imagine facial recognition happening en masse should consider exactly how much computing power would be needed. “Just on an escalator at a tube station you’d need to recognise a hundred people at the same time,” he says. “And each of those faces would have to be retrieved from a database of millions in the split second it takes them to pass from one screen to another. It’s a possibility but highly unlikely.” As one would imagine, it’s not only a technological issue but a legal one. Nick Johnson, partner at Osborne Clarke and member of its advertising law team, points out that the law is moving towards tougher opt-in rules as the EU general data protection regulation moves from approval to becoming law in May 2018. “The new data privacy laws are very specific about any biometrics belonging to a new, distinct type of data deemed as extra sensitive, alongside health and religion,” he says. “It means brands will need very clear, explicit opt-in permission in which they make it very clear exactly what will be done with the data and offer very clear choices to consumers to opt out. So, it’s a very sensitive area.” En masse, then, facial recognition looks to be a way off and will possibly never be accepted because of privacy concerns. However, as a special feature for customer loyalty schemes, recognition systems are already being tested behind closed doors. If you’re a high flyer, expect to be asked to be recognised soon: but if you are just one of the crowd, expect your face to be counted, but not recognised, next time you stop to stare at an ad on a digital screen.

The global liquid detergent chemicals market is forecast to grow at a CAGR of 4.73% during the period 2016-2020. Commenting on the report, an analyst from the research team said: Shift toward concentrated liquid detergent formulations will be a key trend for market growth. Water scarcity is a growing environmental concern across the world, with only about 0.01% of the total water available for immediate consumption. So, vendors of liquid detergents, such as P&G, Unilever, and Henkel, are focusing on introducing concentrated liquid detergents. Compared to standard liquid detergents that have an average water content of 65%-70%, concentrated formats contain only 5%-50% water. According to the report, high demand for fragrance will be a key driver for market growth. The scent of the product is one of the leading factors influencing the purchase of household detergents.

As Eaton looks set to repeat London’s gold medal performance, here’s everything you need to know about his net worth, and endorsement deals. 1. His Net Worth Is Estimated at $500,000 (Getty) Several websites have pegged Eaton’s worth at an estimated $500,000. However, considering the lucrative endorsement deals he gained for the Rio Olympics, that figure is likely higher. He’s also received recent athletic recognitions, which adds value to his marketability. In December, Eaton won the Jesse Owens Award for U.S. Track and Field Male Athlete of the Year. He was also named World Male Athlete of the Year in November by the International Association of Athletics Federations. 2. He Earned a $750,000 Bonus for Setting a New World Record (Getty) Various sports governing bodies and other organizations offer financial incentives for athletic accomplishments. Eaton earned a $750,000 bonus for setting a new world record during the U.S. Track and Field trials before the London Games, according to E! News. At the 2012 Olympic Trials at the University of Oregon, Eaton finished first in seven of the 10 events to finish with 9,039 points— breaking Roman Sebrle’s 11-year World Record. On August 29, 2015, he beat his own world record with a score of 9,045 points at the 2015 World Championships. 3. He Has Earned Thousands from Major Competitions (Getty) American athletes winning medals at the Rio Olympic Games receive a cash prize from the U.S. Olympic Committee. The awards vary based on the medal won. Those awards are on top of the actual value of a “gold” medal – which is around $366 for the Rio games. The gold medal is a mixture of a small amount of 24-karat gold, some copper and a lot of sterling silver, according to Time. Eaton won $25,000 for his gold-medal finish at the 2012 Olympics Cash awards aren’t only at the Olympics— other international competitions also offer athletes the opportunity to rake in some dough. Eaton has competed in eight major international competitions, winning gold six times (2012 Olympics, 2013 and ’15 World Championships, 2012, ’14 and ’16 World Indoor Championships) and silver once (2011 World Championships). While the exact cash payouts for these competitions vary from year to year, the average for first place is $40,000 per event. According to the IAAF’s website, athletes received a $100,000 bonus for setting a world record per event at the 2015 World Championships. 4. He Has Endorsement Deals Including P&G, Gillette & Visa The road to Rio didn’t only include countless hours of training, it also involved business negotiations for Eaton and his agent. Prior to the summer games, Eaton signed with Gillette to endorse its razors. Sports Business Daily reported that the decathlete would also reprise his role in Procter & Gamble’s “Moms” campaign, which ran during the ’12 Games. “Obviously it’s the same family, so I deal with a lot of the same entities, and they have the same values. It’s also made things easy,” Eaton said of the agreement to Sports Business Daily. Eaton also has deals with Coca-Cola, Visa and Chobani. 5. Eaton is Hoping to Tell His Own Story Through His Business Partnerships Goodness in, Greatness out #NoBadStuff @Chobani pic.twitter.com/8GhTJsmdjI — Ashton Eaton (@AshtonJEaton) August 2, 2016 Eaton told the PostGame it’s important for him to shape his own brand as a professional athlete. He explained it’s something he takes into consideration before entering an endorsement deal. Eaton told the PostGame: You get approached by sponsors, and there’s just campaigns they want to run and the stories they want to tell, and you get a choice,” Eaton says. He’s explaining his new “Perfect Isn’t Pretty” campaign with Gillette, which shines a light on the hard work and suffering that happens behind-the-scenes, months and years before the Olympics arrive. [Myself and Gillette] are kind of looking to tell a parallel narrative. We both have goals, and the path to those goals isn’t always pretty, it’s rough. I think it’s what people should be seeing or hearing. Even if you see a great performance, it’s not always great getting there. There are injuries. … Intrinsically or unconsciously, people understand that — people see those performances and they know there are stories behind that. Another example is the deal he inked with Chobani earlier this year. As he told NBC, the tagline of Chobani’s #NoBadStuff campaign is what attracted Eaton to working with the company. “No bad stuff, it felt like something I have adopted as an athlete. Every day I am faced with some really frustrating situations,” he told NBC. “[And] they do not always get better. But I can choose whether to take those situations and see them as learning experiences.” Michael Phelps’ Net Worth: 5 Fast Facts You Need to Know Michael Phelps is the most decorated Olympian of all time as he competes in his final games in Rio.

We have plans for you Streetcar briefly shut down after reported accident Video primer: Portune vs. Pappas Cincinnati Bell buys streetcar naming rights Jason Williams and Sharon Coolidge , Cincinnati 9:46 p.m. EDT August 18, 2016 Buy Photo Cincinnati's streetcar during testing last fall. (Photo: The Enquirer/Meg Vogel)Buy Photo Cincinnati Bell has signed a 10-year deal worth $3.4 million to put its name on the Downtown and Over-the-Rhine streetcar, a major milestone for a project that has long been seeking support from the corporate community. The streetcar will be known as the "Cincinnati Bell Connector," and its colors and logo will be changed to fit the company's branding. Boarding stations also will be branded by Cincinnati Bell, whose logo features blue and green. Exact details of the new look will be released later, most likely before the streetcar's much-anticipated opening to the public on Sept. 9. "A lot of the yellow will be gone. People who don't like the Steelers' colors should be happy," said City Councilwoman Amy Murray, chair of Council's Transportation Committee, referring to the Pittsburgh-based rival of the Cincinnati Bengals. A majority of the naming rights space will be above the streetcar windows where the yellow -- actually a shade of orange -- currently is, she said. The naming rights deal, first reported Thursday evening on Cincinnati.com, is a significant step for the Greater Cincinnati corporate community, which had remained mostly silent since the streetcar idea was first floated nearly a decade ago. The region's major companies had been unwilling to support the streetcar, which has politically divided City Hall and the local Democratic Party. “The Cincinnati Bell Connector will play an important role in connecting residents, workers and visitors to their jobs and the tremendous entertainment opportunities from The Banks to Over-the-Rhine,” Cincinnati Bell CEO Ted Torbeck said in a statement. “Our mission at Cincinnati Bell is to connect people with what matters, whether it’s through our technology, or through projects like the Cincinnati Bell Connector that will enhance Cincinnati’s thriving urban core.” Cincinnati Bell has been embracing Downtown's renaissance in recent years. In 2014, the communications and technology company moved 600 employees from Norwood to a Downtown office tower at Fourth Street between Broadway and Main streets. Cincinnati Bell now has 1,100 employees based in Downtown. “We look forward to a long and productive partnership with Cincinnati Bell on the Cincinnati Bell Connector and thank them for their continued commitment to the city,” City Manager Harry Black said in a statement. The third party that sells the streetcar's advertising and naming rights, Advertising Vehicles, helped broker the Cincinnati Bell deal. For its troubles, it will receive 38 percent of the $3.4 million from the communications and technology company -- as per a 2015 contract between SORTA and Advertising Vehicles. That amounts to nearly $1.3 million. The deal nets $211,869 per year over the 10-year contract for the streetcar budget. That commitment by Cincinnati Bell could save taxpayers on operating costs, which have been a big concern for Mayor John Cranley and other critics of the streetcar. In February, streetcar officials told City Council they hoped naming rights could generate up to $6.5 million over 20 years. Bell's deal is an important step toward meeting those expectations. Many streetcar supporters have long been calling for Cincinnati corporations, including Procter & Gamble and Kroger, to support the 3.6-mile rail system. Supporters have promoted the streetcar as an economic development project, saying it could help the city draw new residents to the urban core and companies attract young workers. Nonetheless, it is rare for U.S. companies to buy naming rights to public transportation projects. According to Enquirer research, Cincinnati Bell is one of only two big corporations known to buy naming rights specifically for a streetcar project. In March, Quicken Loans agreed to pay $5 million over 10 years for naming rights of the Detroit streetcar. CINCINNATI.COM If city sells streetcar naming rights, stigma may keep buyers away How much marketing value might the move have? "I look at old-school companies like Cincinnati Bell, they have to go out and spend money to remind people why they matter and why they're valuable," said Drew Boyd, a marketing professor at the University of Cincinnati. "Putting your name on a transit line is probably not going to do that. It's more about general awareness. I'd rather them spend money to remind people why they matter and why they improve people's lives and make them more convenient or safe. Just putting your name on something doesn't do a lot. You have a have a message behind it as well." Anti-streetcar rhetoric has quelled significantly at City Hall in recent months as city officials believe they have a solid plan to cover the approximately $4 million annual operating cost. Cincinnati Bell's decision comes after several small businesses and restaurants have signed deals to advertise on the streetcar. The advertising space inside the streetcar vehicles is nearly sold out. Will Cincinnati Bell's decision prompt other corporations such as Procter & Gamble, Kroger and Macy's to jump on board the streetcar and buy advertising? Over-the-Rhine resident and streetcar advocate Derek Bauman believes it will. "This is an opportunity to reach millions of local eyeballs annually and be associated with a project that is a catalyst to the continuing renaissance of our city – and the most technologically advanced light rail vehicles in the world," he said. "Once you start seeing a few companies, that opens the way for other companies," said Councilwoman Murray, a former Procter & Gamble employee.

The Corporate Engagement Awards, hosted last night in London, recognises excellence in communication strategies for partnerships, sponsorships, and corporate social responsibility. Established in 2010, the Corporate Engagement Awards is a celebration of the indispensable talent companies and organisations have for effective communications in collaborations. Highlighting the exemplary work existing across the corporate engagement sphere, particularly in CSR, the sixth annual awards considered partnerships from organisations across a whole host of industries and insights. The ability of an organisation to excel in corporate engagement is a valuable asset to investors and consumers alike. With company engagement increasingly bound up within corporate trust values, creating and sustaining partnerships is beneficial to future company projections. The planning, execution and effectiveness of these strategic collaborations is what the Corporate Engagement Awards aims to recognise and celebrate. The ceremony was held at The Brewery, in Moorgate, Central London, and hosted by comedian and broadcaster Jon Holmes. A location befitting of the national status enjoyed by the Corporate Engagement Awards, The Brewery’s sophisticated atmosphere provided the perfect backdrop to a professional and enjoyable evening, celebrating the best in corporate collaborations and CSR. Andrew Thomas, publishing editor, Communicate magazine, says, “It’s delightful to see so many brands embracing collaboration, at an event dedicated to bringing people together. The Corporate Engagement Awards is dedicated to those companies and organisations which help people collaborate and work in partnerships to achieve a brighter future. There’s good in business, and tonight we are celebrating it.” Follow #CEAwards on Twitter to hear more from the Corporate Engagement Awards winners at The Brewery.

Most Popular The Lowdown is Ad Age's weekly look at news nuggets from across the world of marketing, including trends, campaign tidbits, executive comings and goings and more. Zumbida Credit: MillerCoors MillerCoors is poised to release an alcoholic version of aguas frescas, a traditional Mexican drink made with fruit, water and sugar. The brand is called Zumbida, according to a filing the brewer made with the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau. The label, which is in Spanish, shows a mango flavor with the words "aguas frescas" at top. "Zumbida is a traditional drink done in a distinctly American way -- a fusion," said a MillerCoors spokesman, confirming the launch. The drink has 4.2% alcohol by volume, putting it on par with the average light beer. The label includes the words "con un toque de piquete" which means "with a touch of alcohol." Hispanics are a key audience for beer marketers and are helping drive growth for Mexican imported brands such as Corona Extra and Modelo Especial from Constellation Brands. AB InBev has sought to tap into the growth by importing to the U.S. brands it owns in Mexico, such as Montejo and Estrella Jalisco. MillerCoors does not have a Mexican beer in its portfolio. While Zumbida will be made in the U.S., not Mexico, MillerCoors seems to be aiming to gain credibility with Hispanics by referencing aqua frescas. Coca-Cola Co. and Pepsi Co. soft drinks are displayed for sale inside a Shell Gas Station in Louisville, Kentucky. Credit: Luke Sharrett/Bloomberg Here's more depressing news for the soda category: Coke, Pepsi, Sprite and Fanta all have lost brand value this year, according to a new report from Brand Finance, a business valuation and strategic consultancy. Coca-Cola held onto the top spot of the organization's ranking of 25 beverage brands, but Coke's brand value fell by 5% to $34.2 billion, according to the report. Brand Finance calculates brand value by estimating the likely future sales of a brand and calculating a "royalty rate" that represents "what the owner would have to pay for use of the brand -- assuming it were not already owned," according to a description in a press release. Pepsi's value plummeted 11%, while Coke-owned Sprite fell 5% and Coke-owned Fanta slipped by 1%. Gainers included PepsiCo's Mountain Dew, which jumped 6%. "While consumers may steer clear of carbonated drinks, Mountain Dew has evidently managed to project itself as a worthy purchase despite being carbonated. This is largely due to the fact that the brand has embraced the idea of being an energy drink, thus making the drink appealing to those who want an energy boost," Brand Finance stated. 25 Most Valuable Non-alcoholic Beverage Brands (USDm) Rank 2016 Rank 2015 Brand Brand Value 2016 Brand Value 2015 Brand Value Change 1 1 Coca-Cola 34,180 35,797 -5% 2 2 Pepsi 18,947 21,379 -11% 3 3 Red Bull 6,538 7,389 -12% 4 4 Nescafé 6,169 5,216 18% 5 New Lipton 4,147 3,496 19% 6 6 Gatorade 4,070 3,911 4% 7 5 Sprite 3,762 3,973 -5% 8 7 Fanta 3,318 3,350 -1% 9 10 Mountain Dew 2,739 2,577 6% 10 8 Tropicana 2,613 3,069 -15% 11 New Monster 2,544 2,399 6% 12 New 7-Up 2,328 2,481 -6% 13 New Twinings 2,143 N/A N/A 14 New Folgers 2,012 1,513 33% 15 New Dr Pepper 1,995 2,116 -6% 16 New Yakult 1,882 N/A N/A 17 New Ciel 1,282 N/A N/A 18 New Evian 1,226 N/A N/A 19 New Minute Maid 1,204 N/A N/A 20 New Kagome 1,167 N/A N/A 21 New Ovaltine 1,121 N/A N/A 22 New Mirinda 1,017 N/A N/A 23 New Aquafina 964 1,025 -6% 24 New Nestea 938 N/A N/A 25 New Dasani 933 N/A N/A Source: Brand Finance You can't go wrong with kids and dogs in ads. Moen has worked both into its new campaign from Havas Chicago, which won the account in December. The campaign keeps Moen's 23-year-old tagline "Buy it for looks. Buy it for life." But it focuses more on the life part, with a sentimental father-son bath-time spot breaking earlier this week and a second spot to come later featuring a dog who won't leave her owner alone in the shower (outfitted with a flexible Moen shower head that has a magnetic anchor). The new campaign is launching across TV, print, online video, online radio and social networks. 'MasterChef Junior' season four winner Addison Osta Smith for Velveeta Velveeta Mini Blocks Credit: Jason Kempin/Getty Images for Velveeta courtesy Olson Engage for Kraft Heinz Velveeta is downsizing. The Kraft Heinz brand known for big blocks of processed cheese now has a miniature version, Velveeta Mini Blocks. The new variety has five four-ounce wrapped blocks per package, so people can use a small amount and keep unused portions sealed. "MasterChef Junior" season four winner Addison Osta Smith served as chef on Aug. 16 to promote the product. She served complimentary Cheesy Bacon Risotto, Cheesy Pulled Pork Taquitos and Cheesy Potato Waffles at New York's Blank Slate Coffee & Kitchen, which was renamed Melt for the occasion. "People know me from MasterChef Junior for my fancy desserts and miso-glazed cod, but when I'm at home with my family, we like to keep it fun and easy," Ms. Smith said in a statement, which described her as an "award-winning chef and playtime and sports enthusiast." Olson Engage worked with Velveeta on the launch. Coty is doubling down on Katy Perry, who represents the CoverGirl brand the company will acquire in its soon-to-close deal with Procter & Gamble Co., and who is also launching the Mad Love fragrance brand with a novel campaign on the Kik messaging service. Katy Perry Mad Love Women's Perfume Credit: Coty via Kohl's The campaign by chat app marketing agency Block Party lets users exchange points they earn on Kik (by doing such things as watching videos or downloading sticker packs) for Ms. Perry's Mad Love eau de parfum. This is the first time that consumers can redeem rewards program points for a physical product in a U.S. chat app, according to Coty and Block Party. "It's a way for the brand to maximize engagement and reward young consumers for spreading awareness," said Kristin Spinn, Coty senior director-global marketing, in a statement. "Buy one, give one" is a concept best associated with Toms shoes or Warby Parker glasses. But former USAID consultant David Simnick has been at it as long as those brands since co-founding Soapbox in 2010. Now Soapbox seems to be finding its moment with a new social media campaign from Mekanism that has racked up more than a million views its first week and growing distribution, including an upcoming nationwide rollout in Walmart stores. The "One Hand Washes the Other" concept introduces privileged American kids on a playground to the idea that other kids don't necessarily have soap readily available, and that their purchases (or their parents') can change that.

Wendy's is also giving frugal Frosty fans a free subscription to the MLB.TV Premium streaming service for the rest of the Major League Baseball season if they post a selfie on their public Twitter or Instagram accounts with a Frosty and the hashtag #50centFrostyMLB. Some fans, of course, decided to have fun with the offer, posting references to rapper 50 Cent's poor pitch from 2014. Wendy's is promoting the deal on Twitter and elsewhere. Plus, baseball fans heard about the offer through an MLB.com partners' email. 50 Cent & #MLB shouldn't even be in the same sentence…#50CentFrostyMLB pic.twitter.com/PDCHc8sefO — Ⓐustiη♠️Ⓦəstmoore (@Mr_Westmoore) August 15, 2016 We're still in the muggy throes of summer but brands are already thinking about Halloween. Retailers including Rite Aid began pushing the holiday with in-store displays weeks ago. Since it's the 50th anniversary of "It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown!" -- yes, Linus has spent half a century waiting in vain for a squash -- Peanuts will collaborate with 98 farms across the country, and cornfield maze design firm the Maize, to promote the brand. Special events for the Iconix Brand Group-owned brand will include mazes with Peanuts characters and special TV screenings. Like in 2008, Iconix will also partner with Rock the Vote and celebrities including John Oliver and Whoopi Goldberg to encourage voter registration for the upcoming election. Liquor marketer Beam Suntory has inked a sponsorship deal with the Major League Soccer franchise LA Galaxy. The pact includes sponsorship of the team and the StubHub Center, the multi-use stadium in Carson, Calif., where the team plays. Beam is opening the Hornitos Tequila Cantina in the stadium, which is named for one of its tequila brands, as well as the Jim Beam Bourbon Champions Lounge, which is described as a 2,200 square-foot recently renovated premium-seating area, according to a statement. In other stadium news, the Miami Dolphins today are expected to announce that its home stadium will be renamed Hard Rock Stadium as part of a deal with Hard Rock International, the Orlando-based operator of restaurants, hotels and casinos, according to the Miami Herald. As the Herald noted, the stadium has had multiple naming rights partners in recent years. It was most recently called Sun Life Stadium, after the financial services company. Contributing: E.J.

Bank expects continued growth in Morgantown, WV area - Business, Government Legal News from throughout WV Member Center: Create Account| Log In Manage Account| Log Out SITE SEARCHWEB SEARCH BY Home News Business Government Energy Law Opinion Lynne D. Schwabe Brooks McCabe Charlie Bowen John Brown Dolly Withrow Linda Arnold Government Law Energy SHOP About Us Job Openings Bank expects continued growth in Morgantown, WV area Posted: Thursday, July 28, 2016 9:05 AM EDT Updated: Saturday, August 27, 2016 9:05 AM EDT By Jim Ross West Virginia’s economy is growing on par with the national economy, but the northern and eastern parts are doing especially well, two Huntington Bank officials said last week. “The environment for business remains strong throughout 2016 despite all the headwinds we’ve had, and I would include West Virginia in that,” said Chad Prather, Huntington’s senior vice president and West Virginia commercial region manager. Prather said West Virginia has pockets of strong growth, such as the Eastern Panhandle, the Wheeling area, the North-Central part of the state and particularly the Morgantown area. In contrast, the Charleston and Huntington areas do not have robust growth, he said. Prater said the new Interstate 79 interchange and related infrastructure growth along with flat, developable land has fueled some growth in the Morgantown area, and he expects more to follow. Growth at and near West Virginia University is helping with small business growth as well, he said. The Northern Panhandle will benefit from the Shell ethane cracker to be built nearby in Pennsylvania, he said, and the new Procter & Gamble manufacturing facility near Martinsburg is adding to growth in the Eastern Panhandle, Prather said. “Small business thrives whenever economic activity is going on,” said George Mokrzan, senior economist at Huntington Bank. “This will be the year of the consumer, so any services that are tied to consumer spending should do very well.” In West Virginia, that should benefit the tourism industry in particular, he said. Mokrzan said West Virginia’s economic indicators are growing at about the same rate as those nationally. “It looks like a bottom has occurred,” he said. Prather and Mokrzan comment following the second-quarter earnings release of Huntington Bancshares, the parent company of Huntington Bank. In the quarter, Huntington Bancshares earned $175 million in the quarter, down $22 million from the same quarter last year. This story first appeared in the print edition of The State Journal.

(AP ... more Photo: Rebecca Blackwell Simone Biles' marketability window could be small there's always someone new 1 / 3 Back to Gallery RIO DE JANEIRO — In a hallway underneath the Rio Olympic Arena, a crush of journalists pushed against the metal fence in front of the world's best gymnast. Simone Biles, not even 5 feet tall, seemed to be swallowed up by the crowd. She fiddled with the green strap of her credential, but otherwise appeared at ease with another day as one of the most recognizable faces at the Summer Olympics. "We have an idea of just how big it is back home," the 19-year-old said. Biles won four gold medals, including the coveted all-around title, during an adjective-defying week where she made the sport's most difficult feats look routine. The performance cemented her place as perhaps the most gifted gymnast in history. She's so well known that she can't visit the Christ the Redeemer statue towering over Rio de Janeiro alone. More than a million people have followed her bubbly Instagram account this month. Limited-edition cereal boxes will celebrate her golden achievement. Translating that success into a long-term income stream promises to be difficult, because of a small window for most Olympians to capitalize on their notoriety. Biles could be an exception, particularly if she returns for the Tokyo Olympics in four years. "I wish it wasn't the case, but Olympians have a very short shelf life," said Matt Delzell, managing director of the The Marketing Arm in Dallas that specializes in sports and entertainment promotion. "We fall in love with these athletes who represent our country so well and then we forget about them. Then the next thing comes along." Biles carries a compelling backstory, adopted by her grandparents, Ron and Nellie, at age 5 during her birth mother's struggle with alcohol and drug addiction. Biles insists she's not a celebrity. But her showmanship has helped to turn her into one. When she winked at Shawn Johnson, the Olympic gold medalist in the balance beam in 2008, during a floor exercise weeks before the Games, video of the moment went viral. "I'm not the next Usain Bolt or Michael Phelps," she said after winning the all-around title last week. "I'm the first Simone Biles." The difference is Bolt and Phelps have shown the ability to transcend the four-year Olympic cycle. Fame for most Olympians comes and goes as quickly as the 17-day Games. Bolt, however, is the world's fastest human with wide-ranging international appeal, and Phelps, the swimmer who just completed his fifth Games and plans to retire, is the most decorated Olympian of all time. They don't just bring strong personalities and groundbreaking athletic success, they've done so at the Games over an extended period of time. Experts point to Gabby Douglas, who won all-around champion at the London Olympics, but didn't bring the same level of attention to Rio de Janeiro, as an example of the challenge gymnasts face to remain in the public eye when their careers are shorter than almost every other sport. "The limelight will die down. It's not as if gymnastics is a 24/7 sport," said Joe Favorito, a sports marketing expert who is a professor at Columbia University. "But (Biles) certainly has the ability between her background, her success and her personality to transcend the Games and make it beyond the four years." Added Delzell: "You're going to capitalize on the millions of eyeballs that are watching right now when she's the talk of the town, when she's the talk of the country." Biles got a head start. The three-time world champion turned professional last year — passing up the opportunity to compete for UCLA — and quickly amassed a wide-ranging portfolio of sponsorships. Months before her first gold medal, she was already treated like an Olympic champion. Sponsors lined up to capitalize on her success. She has her own line of gymnastics equipment and leotards. She endorsed a sports drink. She starred in advertisements for Procter & Gamble and Hershey's. She signed with Nike. Her face adorned a Kellogg's cereal box. Bob Dorfman, executive creative director for San Francisco-based Baker Street Advertising, sees more athlete-related marketing being taken care of in advance of the Games, rather than as a reaction to a flurry of gold medals. Biles has already taken the first step to make the success last. "You have to do something pretty special like she's done," Dorfman said. "A lot of this has to do with what kind of staying power she has." Experts estimate the pre-Olympics deals were worth between $2 million and $4 million, with the potential for $3 million or more in earnings in the coming year. That total could increase if Biles competes at the Tokyo Olympics. Though a new U.S. gymnastics star or two seems to emerge every four years, Daniel Rascher, a University of San Francisco sport management professor, thinks Biles might be an exception. Finding a way to maintain her level of exposure in non-Olympic years is key. "Simone is a superstar and has the ability to cut across a larger swath of the public's consciousness," he said. Next month, Biles, one of only six gymnasts ever to win four gold medals at the same Olympics, will join a group of gymnasts for a 36-city tour. Spectators can watch her signature move — named the "Biles" — a double layout with a half twist at the end during the floor exercise that no one else can do. It's enough to appear superhuman, though Martha Karolyi, the stern-faced coordinator for the U.S. women's national team, took pains to remind a group of journalists earlier this week that Biles is, in fact, human. Nastia Liukin, the all-around champion at the Beijing Olympics in 2008, understands better than most what's ahead for Biles. "The first few months, maybe the first year, she's going to struggle with having a normal life," said Liukin, who provided gymnastics commentary for NBC in Rio de Janeiro. "It's very exciting at first, but at some point you want to be able to go to a restaurant or get your nails done or go to the grocery or just be Nastia. I wanted to morph myself from being Nastia the Olympic champion to being me." And for Biles these days, being herself is enough. This is a TU+ story. Click for more information.

Feinstein, Collins would give FDA more authority over cosmetics than it has over food. Eric Boehm|Aug. 17, 2016 3:40 pm Peter Bolter/Western Mail and Echo Copyright/NewscomAfter a bad batch of shampoo made some customers hair fall out, the New York Times ran a front page story on Tuesday asking whether Congress should give the Food and Drug Administration more regulatory authority over hair and skin products. The entire piece is an exercise in "do-somethingism," since there are already better ways for the market—and yes, even the government—to deal with the problems created by Wen Hair Care, the shampoo product at the center of a $26 million class action lawsuit. It appears that the article was prompted by ongoing congressional efforts to apply more regulations to the cosmetics industry and give the FDA authority to issue recalls of skin and hair products. More on that in a moment. First, the facts. The piece starts off wanting you to know that Los Angeles hairstylist Chaz Dean made "millions" by selling a variety of scented hair care products. Those same products ended up prompting more than 21,000 complaints from consumers who experienced unwanted itching, rashes and even widespread hair loss after using Dean's Wen Hair Care products. Without even pausing to consider whether those people have another sort of recourse besides an expensive expansion of federal regulatory power (spoiler alert: they do), the Times turns to U.S. Sens. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, and Susan Collins, R-Maine, who are pitching new legislation to require the FDA to do additional testing of cosmetic products and give the FDA authority to issue mandatory recalls for "products found to be unsafe." There's good reason to feel sympathy for the victims here—no one expects to end up temporarily bald because they purchased a bottle of supposedly "revolutionary" shampoo and they are right to be upset about it—but the lack of federal regulations on cosmetics didn't cause this problem and isn't the best way to fix it. Let's start by looking at what happened to those "millions" that Chaz Dean made by apparently swindling unsuspecting consumers. A class action lawsuit against Wen Hair Care and its manufacturer, Guthy-Renker LLC, resulted in a $26 million settlement for the plaintiffs. The settlement awards $25 to any person who bought a bottle of Wen and up to $20,000 to anyone who experienced bodily harm or hair loss after using the product. That's how the government should be involved in a situation like this: in a judiciary role to work out a settlement between the aggrieved parties and the business responsible for misleading them. The system works! The Times article suggests this application of government is not enough; that the federal authorities must be more active to prevent this sort of thing from happening at all or at least to respond more quickly when it does. The FDA must be able to force companies to recall potentially problematic products, Feinstein and Collins argue. When trying to decide whether the government should have the authority to force businesses to recall products, it's important to know how recalls work. In almost all cases, recalls are voluntary actions taken by manufacturers. That's true whether we're talking about cosmetic products regulated by the FDA or whether you're looking how the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration oversees recalls of defective automotive parts. Even when comes to issues of food safety—certainly an area where there is a greater potential threat to public health and safety than what is created by bad shampoo—the FDA can only request a recall. The final decision rests with the food supplier, and oftentimes businesses will initiate their own recalls without being asked by the FDA because it's generally accepted that lying to your customers or making them sick isn't good for business. The same is true here. Good cosmetic businesses will issue recalls of faulty products as a way to maintain consumer trust (and to avoid the kinds of class action lawsuits like the one brought against Wen in this instance). Businesses that provide bad products and then don't come clean about the problems—no matter what industry they are a part of—won't stay in business for long. At the risk of sounding facetious: shampoo that causes baldness is already pretty bad for business, even before the $25 million lawsuits start rolling in. To recap: the people who were negatively affected by Wen Hair Care were compensated for their losses and the FDA has the same authority over recalls for cosmetic products as it does over recalls related to food safety or anything else. What more could you want the government to do in this situation? Feinstein and Collins want to pile more regulations onto the cosmetic industry. In addition to letting the FDA issue mandatory recalls, their bill would require the FDA to test all cosmetic products that contain at least one of five common ingredients. That's going to cost an estimated $20 billion annually, with the funds being extracted from the cosmetic industry in the form of new "fees." This legislation is important, we're told by U.S. Rep. Frank Pallone Jr., D-New Jersey, because "there is effectively no regulation of cosmetics." Except there is. The FDA's website explains that it "monitors the safety of cosmetic products that are being marketed and acts on products that are established to be harmful to consumers when used as intended." It does that by conducting inspections of manufacturing facilities and by surveying products on the market "especially if aware of a potential problem." That information is used to alert consumers, support regulatory actions or issue guidance for industry, the FDA says. The Times touts the fact that the bill has "won the endorsement of heavyweights" in the cosmetic industry, including Clinique, Johnson & Johnson, MAC and Procter and Gamble. Opposition comes from the Independent Cosmetic Manufacturers and Distributors, a trade group that represents portions of the industry generally not large enough to be household names and not wealthy enough to hire their own lobbyists. This is the same story that often plays out when government tries to increase regulations. Larger companies—like those "heavyweights" of the industry rattled off by the Times—are better able to absorb the added cost of regulations and will support the expansion of regulations as a way to hurt smaller competitors. This is the same dynamic driving the FDA's expensive, destrutive and unnecessary regulations of electronic cigarettes, by the way. In a statement to Reason, the Independent Cosmetic Manufacturers and Distributors said it did not support the Feinstein-Collins bill because "it placed too large a burden on small business, did not provide reasonable national uniformity, and would, if passed, stifle innovation in the cosmetics and personal care industry." There's no way to know whether more testing and regulations would have caught the problems with Wen Hair Care shampoo before it hit store shelves, but the people injured have been compensated and the company paid the price for making a bad product. One business' mistake should not be a reason to add to the regulatory burden faced by all others in the same field. Eric Boehm is a reporter at Reason.com.

Simone Biles competes on the floor exercise during the women's qualifications in Rio. Damir Sagolj / Reuters Most Popular 5 Things to Know About Betsy DeVos, Trump's Pick for Education Secretary Emily DeRuy 2:35 PM ET 'Hail Trump!': White Nationalists Salute the President Elect Daniel Lombroso and Yoni Appelbaum Nov 21, 2016 The Trump Takeover The Editors 7:15 AM ET The Electoral College Was Meant to Stop Men Like Trump From Being President Peter Beinart Nov 21, 2016 The Running Conversation in Your Head Julie Beck 7:00 AM ET Megan Garber Aug 8, 2016 Culture Share Tweet … LinkedIn Email Print Text Size “Okay, before we walked out, I thought I was going to vomit,” Aly Raisman announced after the conclusion of Sunday’s women’s gymnastics qualifications, in Rio. At this confession, her four teammates dissolved into giggles of agreement. “Um, in the back, I thought I was gonna die,” Simone Biles admitted. “Yes!” Raisman replied. “In the bathroom, when me and you were in the bathroom, I asked you, ‘Are you okay?’” Raisman paused. “And I was like, ‘Me neither.’” At that point the gathered women began sharing their nerves-before-competition stories, talking over each other with giddy mentions of the shaking hands and near-vom experiences that came when they finally—finally—found themselves on the Olympic stage. “We just sat there,” Biles said, recalling those tense pre-competition moments, “and we were like”—and then the three-time all-around world champion, the woman an NBC commentator referred to earlier in the evening as “the greatest of all time,” made a dramatic shruggie gesture. In response to which: Her team giggled some more. Related Story The Weird Athleticism of the Victoria's Secret Model NBC’s roving cameras caught that off-stage exchange—superhumans, acting in a decidedly human fashion—after the five women had clinched the U.S.’s spot to compete for team gold in Rio. But the athletes (also known as “Team USA,” the “Fierce Five: Redux,” and “The Most Dominant U.S. Gymnastics Team Ever Assembled”) didn’t merely secure the team’s place in the finals, and they didn’t merely come away with a first-place ranking heading into the competition that will determine who wins medals. Instead, they smashed through the high expectations set for them. And yet here they were, after their big, if unsurprising, victory, commiserating and confessing and laughing and acting, in the end, like exactly what they are: a group of young—very young—women. Women’s gymnastics is traditionally one of the most-watched events of the summer Games—much more popular than its masculine counterpart, which features similar feats of super-human strength and skill. (The rings! THE RINGS.) That’s in part because women’s gymnastics is, as entertainment, riveting—the balance beam alone is basically a 4-inch-thick hunk of Hitchcock—but it is also, likely, because the sport presents collisions of a more cultural strain. Here are young women, bedecked of bow and bedazzled of leotard, flexing and flipping and generally giving a massive side-eye to gravity itself. Here are the performance of sport and the performance of femininity, united in a singular, if extremely precarious, harmony. The team’s leos will feature nearly 5,000 crystals in designs that evoke shooting stars and swirling clouds. In that sense, women’s gymnastics captivates because it insinuates: The sport serves, on top of everything else, as a metaphor for a cultural moment that is appending notions of strength (and not just “moral strength”) to womanhood. It exemplifies the tensions of a time that is newly distinguishing between the female and the feminine. It’s a sport, too, with an undeniably political edge: Women’s gymnastics, like this particular moment in feminism, pays lip service to ideals of “empowerment,” but its workings are underscored by the knowledge that years’ worth of effort can, through gravity’s apathy, be undone in a single instant. Sweaty and sparkly, muscular and girly, explosive and controlled: Gymnastics is the successful execution of many different balancing acts. * * * Women’s gymnastics, in its current form, owes a lot both to second-wave feminism and to Title IX—which brought about the general de-dainty-ization of the traditionally balletic sport. (“Before the 1970s,” the essayist Meghan O’Rourke points out, “women’s gymnastics had been snoozy and staid, resembling, as a Sports Illustrated writer put it, ‘a lyrical exercise somewhere this side of ballet.’”) A recent change in the sport’s scoring system, which took away the long-standing cap of 10, allowed for ever-upward difficulty levels in routines, which in turn further emphasized feat-affording strength among its athletes. It may have preserved its official name—“artistic gymnastics”—amid all these changes, but the sport’s champions ascend by embracing moves that are traditionally not “ladylike”: leaping, grasping, thudding, punching the air after a stuck landing. Gymnastics is determinedly unladylike in another way, too: It is for the most part practiced, at the elite levels, only by very young women (the current U.S. team ranges in age from 16 to 22). This is emphasized in an aesthetic that borrows heavily from what you might call “pageant chic.” Team USA is known, in particular, for its bedazzled competition uniforms, and each Olympics has brought with it leotards that are more crystal-encrusted—with Swarovski versions, as “they have the most shine and sparkle”—than the last. (Given how much of a “typical” adolescence elite gymnasts are made to sacrifice in their athletic pursuits, it’s at this point a cliche of the sport to talk about their sparkling competition leotards as their “prom dresses.”) This year, The New York Times reports, the women’s leos will feature nearly 5,000 individual crystals—in designs that evoke shooting stars and swirling clouds and the other stuff of dreams fulfilled. Stories from the games in Rio Read more Dramatic makeup, too, is a mainstay of the gymnastics floor—Biles, last night, wore sparkling eyeliner that mimicked the swooping lines of the team leo—as are manicured fingers and pedicured toes. (This is perhaps because USA Gymnastics stipulates, without a bit of irony, that each athlete competing under its auspices must be “well groomed in her appearance.”) On Sunday, NBC’s omniscient camera caught Madison Kocian, the 19-year-old whose specialty is the uneven bars, kneeling on the floor after having executed a nearly perfect routine. She was zipping her chalk-covered grips into a hot-pink makeup bag. It’s not only gymnasts, of course, who embrace their femininity on the field of play. Hair ribbons are a mainstay of women’s softball. Brandi Chastain celebrated her scoring of the U.S. women’s soccer team’s game-winning penalty shot against China by taking off her shirt to reveal her sports bra. Flo-Jo was known for her elaborate manicures, and in her spirit, this time around, come—among others—the French basketball player Emmeline Ndongue, who wears patriotic stripes on her nails, and the American volleyball player Destinee Hooker, whose manicure sports the union flag and the Olympic rings. Procter & Gamble went so far as to set up a nail salon in the Olympic village so that athletes—presumably women—might similarly bedazzle themselves. Women’s gymnastics, though, is notable for something beyond its athletes’ embrace of their femininity: its simultaneous embarrassment about their femaleness. Women gymnasts have come to resemble swimmers in their uniform lack of body hair—waxing being an unspoken mandate that has as much to do with aesthetics as with aerodynamics. (Well groomed in her appearance.) The gymnasts’ outfits, too, their snazzy sparkles notwithstanding, suggest a certain abashedness about the female form: Judges are free to deduct points for underwear that peeks out from beyond the athletes’ leos. It’s a sartorial awkwardness that reflects a more systemic one. In gymnastics, the body fat that is a typical signal of healthy womanhood is stubbornly burned off. The development of breasts has curtailed otherwise promising careers. The rigors of training—coupled with eating disorders that have been known to afflict its athletes—can delay menstruation. Women’s gymnastics, on the whole, may celebrate its eponymous “women”; it is also, however, decidedly ambivalent about them. Many of its workings suggest a preference to see those women, whatever their age and achievement, as girls. USA Gymnastics stipulates, without a hint of irony, that each athlete must be “well groomed in her appearance.” And then, of course, there are allegations of sexual abuse that have long cast a shadow over the sport. Joan Ryan’s 1995 book, Little Girls in Pretty Boxes, told stories not just of bullying young athletes have endured at the hands of their coaches, but of abuse. USA Gymnastics banned Don Peters, the coach of the 1984 Olympic team, from the sport after several of the athletes he’d trained made accusations against him—but it didn’t do so until 2011. Last week, the IndyStar released the results of a lengthy investigation into the matter, concluding that USAG has “turned a blind eye to sex abuse.” The tension, across the sport’s elite levels—a dynamic of fragility and strength, of empowerment and its opposite—has escalated to such a degree that some critics have wondered whether watching women’s gymnastics is, at this point, unethical. One of those wonderings, however, accompanied its text—ironically, or perhaps fittingly, and either way revealingly—with artistic photographs of Olympian and other elite gymnasts that emphasized not just the athletes’ muscles, but also their manicures and hairdos and, in a couple of cases, their crotches. * * * In that, gymnastics is an extreme reflection of a widespread cultural ambivalence—about youth in general, perhaps, but about girlhood in particular. On the one hand, “empowerment” is the ethic of the moment, via toys and clothes and media messaging that seek to downplay gender as a factor in a young person’s life. NBC, on Sunday, featured a bio package with Gabby Douglas, one of the stars who emerged from the London Games (and the other gymnast—with Raisman—who is representing the U.S., in 2016, for her second Olympics). Douglas, in an interview, cited Serena Williams as one of her role models, and her explanation reflected the feminist messaging of the moment. “She’s just so dominant,” the star gymnast said of the tennis star, “and she just goes after what she wants, and she’s just so aggressive. I love strong, empowered women.” Gymnastics, even more than other sports, emphasizes the challenges gravity-bound women must navigate. In the same series of Better Know an Athlete packages, though, NBC emphasized, for Simone Biles, not her dominance or her aggression, but instead her … girly femininity. Biles’s short documentary featured footage of the young athlete grinning at the camera while getting a manicure (and requesting that her nails be done in patriotic red and blue). The young champion, Bob Costas intoned, “in any other context might seem like any other teenager”—and his thesis was proven, again and again. “She loves girly stuff,” Biles’s mother shared in an interview for the package, “so she loves to shop and she loves to get her hair done, her nails done. She likes to feel pretty.” Her father, in a separate interview, agreed: “She’s a teenager. A typical female teenager.” These mini-movies will always, across sports and across Games, engage in a kind of doubling: Their point is to emphasize the ordinariness of athletes who have chosen lives that are, by definition, anything but ordinary—and to make those athletes relatable, as such, to their couch-sitting audiences. They will always revel in the banality of greatness, and vice versa. But what Sunday’s treatments of the U.S. Olympic team did was to suggest another kind of paradox, and another kind of relatability—one that has as much to do with the athletes’ gender as with their athleticism. This may be the age of women’s empowerment, the age of Serena Williams and Gabby Douglas and Simone Biles and Hillary Clinton; it is also, though, the age of Donald Trump and the wage gap and the tampon tax and the Bic for Her Fashion Retractable Ball Pen, manufactured in a lady-friendly pink. It is also the age that found the Chicago Tribune, on Sunday, announcing the fact that Corey Cogdell-Unrein had medaled for the U.S. in trap-shooting with the tweet, “Wife of a Bears’ lineman wins a bronze medal today in Rio Olympics.” So the political message of women’s gymnastics is on the one hand what the political message of any women’s sports will eventually be: It separates achievement, casually but also meaningfully, from aesthetics. Sports don’t care what a woman looks like, or whether she’s graceful, or whether she’s pleasing to anyone. They care only how high she jumped, how quickly she ran, how many goals she scored. And yet gymnastics comes with particular caveats about looks and behavior and “grace.” It carries standards, both stipulated and unspoken, about one’s comportment. It enforces, for all the strength it demands of its athletes, a certain daintiness. Its competitors, the sport seems to believe—no matter what else they achieve—had better look good while doing their achieving. In that sense gymnastics is, for better or for worse, much more in line than other sports are with the challenges that gravity-bound women face every day. An Under Armour ad that went viral in the lead-up to the Rio Games showed Madison Kocian training, with other women gymnasts, for her Olympics debut. The ad featured inspiring music. It featured the brand’s tagline of of-the-moment empowerment: “Rule yourself.” It featured scenes of the gymnast who is currently one of the best in the world sacrificing, striving, hurting, pushing … and getting her nails done.

President-Elect Donald Trump on Wednesday said he will nominate the Michigan philanthropist and prominent Republican donor Betsy DeVos to be U.S. Education Secretary. The announcement signals that big changes could be on the way for schools and students around the country. Here are five things to know: 1. DeVos will push for school choice DeVos has been a vocal supporter of school choice, which is something Trump backed on the campaign trail. DeVos, who heads up the pro-charter and pro-school-voucher nonprofit American Federation for Children, has said parents should have the ability to choose the best schools for their children, whether they are traditional public schools, charters, or private schools. Trump has proposed creating a $20 billion federal voucher program for families to use to send their kids to the school of their choice. But, as Education Week noted recently, making that program a reality could be difficult. It’s unclear exactly where the funding would come from, and even if Congress did manage to pass such a proposal, some states currently prohibit funds from going to schools with religious affiliations, which could complicate how those funds are used.

Spencer saluted more than 200 attendees on Saturday, gathered at the Ronald Reagan Building in Washington, D.C., for the annual conference of the National Policy Institute, which describes itself as “an independent organization dedicated to the heritage, identity, and future of  people of European descent in the United States, and around the world.” Spencer has popularized the term “alt-right” to describe the movement he leads. Spencer has said his dream is “a new society, an ethno-state that would be a gathering point for all Europeans,” and has called for “peaceful ethnic cleansing.” For most of the day, a parade of speakers discussed their ideology in relatively anodyne terms, putting a presentable face on their agenda. But after dinner, when most journalists had already departed, Spencer rose and delivered a speech to his followers dripping with anti-Semitism, and leaving no doubt as to what he actually seeks. He referred to the mainstream media as “Lügenpresse,” a term he said he was borrowing from “the original German”; the Nazis used the word to attack their critics in the press.

Americans talk about democracy like it’s sacred. In public discourse, the more democratic American government is, the better. The people are supposed to rule. But that’s not the premise that underlies America’s political system. Most of the men who founded the United States feared unfettered majority rule. James Madison wrote in Federalist 10 that systems of government based upon “pure democracy … have ever been found incompatible with personal security or the rights of property.” John Adams wrote in 1814 that, “Democracy never lasts long. It soon wastes, exhausts and murders itself.” The framers constructed a system that had democratic features. The people had a voice. They could, for instance, directly elect members of the House of Representatives. But the founders also self-consciously limited the people’s voice.

But we also use it when we’re all alone; it shapes even our silent relationships with ourselves. In his book, The Voices Within, Charles Fernyhough gives a historical overview of “inner speech”—the more scientific term for “talking to yourself in your head.” Fernyhough, a professor at Durham University in the U.K., says that inner speech develops alongside social speech. This idea was pioneered by Lev Vygotsky, a Russian psychologist who studied children in the 1920s and noted that when they learned to talk to other humans, they also learned how to talk to themselves, first out loud, and eventually, in their heads. Continue Reading Yamada Taro / Getty What’s So Great About American World Leadership? Hugh White The U.S. voters who rejected decades of bipartisan foreign-policy consensus might be on to something. How has America come to elect a president who so starkly repudiated decades’ worth of the largely bipartisan vision of U.S. global leadership? And if that vision won’t be the basis of American foreign policy in the 21st century, what will replace it? The big message of 2016 is that large numbers of American voters, Democrat and Republican, do not buy what their political leaders have been selling for so long, and that includes foreign policy. The evidence of this from Trump’s victory is reinforced by Senator Bernie Sanders’ remarkable showing in the Democratic primaries, and by years’ worth of public-opinion surveys showing the widespread view that the United States “does too much in helping solve world problems.” It is also reinforced by the high poll numbers of an outgoing president who has mounted his own quiet campaign against key elements of Washington’s foreign-policy orthodoxy.

In February 1990, thanks to a 15-year-old boy named Bruno Kowalsczewski, footsteps echoed through the chambers of Bruniquel Cave for the first time in tens of thousands of years. The cave sits in France’s scenic Aveyron Valley, but its entrance had long been sealed by an ancient rockslide. Kowalsczewski’s father had detected faint wisps of air emerging from the scree, and the boy spent three years clearing away the rubble. He eventually dug out a tight, thirty-meter-long passage that the thinnest members of the local caving club could squeeze through. They found themselves in a large, roomy corridor. There were animal bones and signs of bear activity, but nothing recent. The floor was pockmarked with pools of water. The walls were punctuated by stalactites (the ones that hang down) and stalagmites (the ones that stick up).

Trump. Estimates of Trump’s wealth vary substantially: While he self-reports a net worth of $10 billion, independent agencies have arrived at valuation generally between $3 billion and $5 billion. The unprecedented nature of Trump’s business interests, coupled with the many precedents that Trump broke throughout his campaign—not releasing his tax returns, for example, which severely limits attempts to understand his financial situation—has provoked speculation that his presidency may bring about equally unprecedented opportunities for conflicts of interest. Trump’s response—provided on Twitter—only reinforces concerns that he will make little effort to avoid entangling his business and personal interests, and will instead attack those who point that out. Continue Reading sketchblog/flickr Masters of Love Emily Esfahani Smith Science says lasting relationships come down to—you guessed it—kindness and generosity. Every day in June, the most popular wedding month of the year, about 13,000 American couples will say “I do,” committing to a lifelong relationship that will be full of friendship, joy, and love that will carry them forward to their final days on this earth. Except, of course, it doesn’t work out that way for most people. The majority of marriages fail, either ending in divorce and separation or devolving into bitterness and dysfunction. Of all the people who get married, only three in ten remain in healthy, happy marriages, as psychologist Ty Tashiro points out in his book The Science of Happily Ever After, which was published earlier this year. Social scientists first started studying marriages by observing them in action in the 1970s in response to a crisis: Married couples were divorcing at unprecedented rates. Worried about the impact these divorces would have on the children of the broken marriages, psychologists decided to cast their scientific net on couples, bringing them into the lab to observe them and determine what the ingredients of a healthy, lasting relationship were. Was each unhappy family unhappy in its own way, as Tolstoy claimed, or did the miserable marriages all share something toxic in common?

Here’s why the race between Governor Pat McCrory and Democrat Roy Cooper isn’t over yet. DURHAM, N.C.—It’s been two weeks since Election Day, which means that in 49 states, residents know who their governor will be next year. North Carolinians, however, are still waiting to see. At the end of balloting on November 8, Democrat Roy Cooper, the current state attorney general, had a lead of a few thousand votes over Governor Pat McCrory, a Republican. Cooper promptly declared victory, but McCrory has not conceded the race, and the state has not been able to declare a winner. On Monday, Cooper announced a transition team, while McCrory accused him of “circumventing the electoral process.” Cooper’s lead fluctuated throughout the day on Tuesday as more counties returned their final canvass, but as of writing it was a little more than 6,000 votes out of roughly 4,700,000.

A farm in California practicing underground micro-irrigation to cope with the state's prolonged drought. The drought has cost the farmers and agricultural businesses some US$2.7 billion in revenue losses. Image: US Department of Agriculture, CC BY 2.0 By Asit Biswas and Cecilia Tortajada and Giovanna Chandler Thursday 18 August 2016 Share this story Two key events took place in in Singapore last month. First was the Water Leaders’ Summit within the context of the Singapore International Water Week, and the second was a CNBC discussion on Future of World’s Water: A Business Perspective. Both events explored in depth the role that business can play in managing global water resources. Senior officers from the world’s largest corporations and leading academic figures also discussed interlinkages between business and water. The global business community has faced substantial stress and challenges during the post-2000 period. Among these are investor demands for sustainable investments, resource scarcities, increasing scrutiny by media and social activists about malpractices, real or perceived, and continuing technological and management evolutions. These developments have heralded a new era for corporate sustainability reporting where businesses explain impacts of their operational practices on society, natural resources and environment. While sustainability reporting has mostly been voluntary, increasing scrutiny and pressure from non-governmental organisations (NGOs), media and governments, have encouraged the companies to assess and often publicly divulge the impacts, both positive and negative, of their activities on profitability and on society, natural resources and environment. In response to growing demand from investors, NGOs and media for broader and more comprehensive disclosure on environmental, social and governance (ESG) indicators for business operation, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of the United States issued a guidance for publicly listed companies on key ESG issues. This guidance requires companies to take into account climate-related risks and uncertainties, physical availability of water as well as their quality considerations that could contribute to “decreased agricultural production capacity in areas affected by droughts or other weather-related changes”. The continuing California drought, and droughts in Australia, China and India, show that these events can directly affect the quality and levels of production, costs of doing business, and net profits. Under serious water scarcity conditions, a company’s licence to operate in an arid region may even be revoked, or significantly reduced. These are all material risks that investors should be aware of since they may affect the share prices of companies. Consider the current drought in California. This has cost the farmers and agricultural businesses some US$2.7 billion in revenue losses. Similarly, for a major developing country such as India, Indian President Pranab Mukherjee (and earlier finance minister) has aptly remarked that the monsoon is “the real finance minister of India” since it affects the economy in a myriad of ways. Availability of water thus has major economic impact on business and nations. “ Under serious water scarcity conditions, a company’s licence to operate in an arid region may even be revoked, or significantly reduced. For water, corporations need to ask three fundamental questions. First, is there enough reliable supply available, both in terms of quantity and quality, for their existing operations and future growth? Second, since water is always a local issue, will local authorities permit water withdrawals during prolonged drought years given their own water management practices are invariably poor and thus unlikely to meet increasing water needs? Third, is there a reputational risk for businesses even when water is available and companies have necessary permits to extract water during drought years? Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola had to close plants in India in 2004, even when they had authorisations to extract water. Savvy investors all over the world are now aware of the importance of water as a business risk, especially for food, beverage, clothing, textile, pulp, paper, energy and mining industries. Every industry needs water for operational purposes, but some industries need significant amounts of water, and are thus more vulnerable to water scarcity. The first major investor group to demand water information is the Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM). It now manages an US$862 billion portfolio of the Norwegian Government Pension Fund. It announced in August 2009 that it would start assessing the water risk management practices of 1,100 companies in which they held shares. Sustainability reports have been around for decades in one form or another. While such reports have gained momentum in the 21st century, their usefulness to investors and general public has been rather limited for many reasons.  Corporations in different industrial sectors use different production and manufacturing processes, and have different reasons for producing sustainability reports. In addition, large corporations often have operations in many countries across the world, and several facilities in each country. Thus, methodologically, it is difficult to determine their performance at a global level. Data used for one company, from one plant to another, may not be compatible. Equally, the data reliability often varies among locations. “ Savvy investors all over the world are now aware of the importance of water as a business risk, especially for food, beverage, clothing, textile, pulp, paper, energy and mining industries. No agreed global standard There is no agreed global standard and framework for sustainability reports. Three most prominent frameworks are Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC) and Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB). Each has its own philosophy, approach and guidelines as to how sustainability should be defined, determined, assessed and reported. Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) started a new water risk disclosure assessment and reporting in 2009. CDP requests water-related information from companies. In its latest 2015 report, it noted only 38 per cent of companies responded to investors’ requests for disclosure on water-related data. While producing excellent reports, CDP faces some fundamental problems. Companies provide information, which is then analysed. In the current era where major companies deliberately provided erroneous information, there has to be ways to double check the veracity of information received. In addition, companies are interpreting identical questions differently. Finally, reporting activities of companies are often conducted by junior staff, sometimes even by interns, who lack overall understanding of the situations and exercise. CDP included eight companies in its “Water A List”. Based on our analysis, at least one of the companies in this list do not deserve to be there, and two of the world’s best companies in terms of managing water risk are not included. Importance of water for business Even before preparation of sustainability reports became mainstream, many corporations realised that reliable availability of water is a major risk. Take Nestle. It has taken active steps since the late 1990s to significantly improve its water use efficiencies and wastewater management practices. Between 2005 and 2013, it reduced direct water withdrawal for every product category by one-third. This also meant reduction of total water discharges from 145 to 91 million cubic metres, even though total production increased significantly. It is assisting farmers to produce products in an increasingly water-efficient manner. Procter & Gamble decided to reduce its water consumption by 20 per cent during 2010-2020. They achieved this target by 2015. Some 70 per cent of P&G products require water during their use. Through technological innovations, these products have become more water efficient and less polluting. For example, Downy fabric softeners enable consumers to rinse only once, instead of 3-4 times, saving 30-50 per cent of water in each washing. The company has now completely phased out phosphates globally from detergents, thus reducing the eutrophication potential of receiving water bodies. Coca-Cola has improved its water use efficiency by 25 per cent since 2005. It also has replenished 94 per cent of water used in finished beverages (153.6 billion litres) through 209 community projects in 61 countries. There is no question that the boardrooms of many major companies now realise that if they want to survive and thrive, they must change their corporate culture and mindset about the use of water. MNCs such as Nestle, Unilever, P&G and Coca-Cola have made remarkable advances since 2000 to significantly reduce their water footprints through new operational policies, process changes and making all their staff more water-sensitive. While the private sector is making rapid changes to improve their water management practices, corresponding advances by the public sector are conspicuous by their absence. If and when the public sector makes corresponding advances, the world’s water problems are likely to be significantly diminished.

Revealed: The luxurious gift bags sponsors shower on Olympic athletes Even Olympians who don't win medals will go home with a bag of goodies Nike and other sponsorship brands have donated dozens of free items In the swags bags are training kit, watches, sunglasses and underwear McDonalds based in the Olympic village is giving athletes free junk food By Imogen Calderwood and Thomas Burrows for MailOnline Published: 17:37 EST, 17 August 2016 | Updated: 20:32 EST, 17 August 2016 e-mail 42 shares 58 View comments If any of the athletes at this year's Olympics forgot to pack a bag for Rio they need not have worried. Sponsors are showering them with goody bags packed with free caps, trainers, t-shirts, leggings and even sports bras. The mad scramble by Olympic partners to have their products worn by athletes means that even if they don't win a medal, they will not go home empty handed. Nike's customised bags given to Brazilian and US athletes includes 40 items of training kit such as jumpers, leggings, trainers and even flip flops The US gymnastics team (from left to right: Madison Kocian, Laurie Hernandez, Simone Biles, Aly Raisman and Gabby Douglas) pose with special edition packs of Kellogg's cereal Partner McDonalds had a restaurant inside the Olympic village where athletes were pictured queuing to collect as much free junk food as they could eat. Team GB cyclist Callum Skinner posted a photo of Jason Kenny beneath the Golden Arches and joked he was buying him dinner the night before his record breaking performance in the velodrome.

Share this article Share Elsewhere, gymnast Simone Biles and her US teammates were posed up with special edition packs of Kellogg's cereal with their medals around their necks. Team GB's cycling heroes - led by Sir Bradley Wiggins - were given free sunglasses by Oakley which they wore to celebrate winning gold on Sunday night. Owain Doull, 23, posted a picture of him and his teammates and wrote: 'Big night last night at Chase & Status. Cheers Oakley for the baller Gold Sunnies.' This is the swag bag from Nike given to every athlete representing host nation Brazil  Callum Skinner tweeted this photo joking how he was feeding Kenny a 'nutritious meal' Sawan Serasinghe’s photo of his enormous order from McDonald's went viral Athletes order at the free McDonald's they have access to in the village where they live for the duration of the Games Members of the Czech squad head back to their accommodation with their free orders But when it comes to freebies, it looks like official sponsor Nike is doing most of the running. The sports giants customised bag given to every one of the 1,200 Team USA athletes and those from the host nation, Brazil, includes 40 items of training kit such as jumpers, leggings, trainers and even flip flops. They were also given drawstring bags, a water bottle, passport case and some weights. Men are given an extra watch, a pair of sunglasses and weights, while females receive extra workout clothes.  Namecheck: Sir Bradley Wiggins and cycling teammates were in a dark nightclub, but still wore their Oakley sunglassses Great Britain’s team sprint gold medalist Philip Hindes tweeted a picture of his huge meal Basketball star Paul George showcased how far-reaching that scope truly is by unveiling his personal Olympic swag bag. His personal bag included practice jerseys and shorts, a red, white and blue warm-up jacket, a grey hoodie and an American eagle-themed t-shirt.  Four years ago at London 2012, the 529 athletes representing USA all brought home gold – along with thousands of pounds' worth of other freebies. It was reported that every one of the US athletes in London were given gold rings worth £460 and a Swiss watch from Omega, the official timekeeper of the Games, worth several thousand pounds.  They also picked up five backpacks full of goodies.  The backpacks received contained 100 items, mostly from major sponsors such as Ralph Lauren, Nike, Oakley, and P&G. In total, nearly 100,000 free items were given out to American athletes. Freebies handed out by eager sponsors are worth considerably more than the gold medals the winners receive - which contain only one per cent gold. They are worth £430, according to Compound Interest. A silver medal is worth £240.  In Rio, around 30 per cent of the silver used is obtained from recycled sources – including X-ray plates, car parts and mirrors. A bronze medal is 95 per cent copper and five per cent zinc - worth just £180.

 YOUR E-MAIL VERIFICATION CODE The economy, a young population, a more qualified labor force compared to surrounding countries, a strategic geographical location between the Middle East and Europe, ease of transportation, cultural affinities and exceptional business relations are just some of the reasons that Turkey has become a regional hub for international companies, resulting in an increasing number of international companies being managed from Turkey in recent years. According to information from the International Investors' Association (YASED), 33 percent of member companies use Turkey as a regional hub, along with dozens of multinational companies including Coca-Cola, Visa, General Electric (GE), British Petroleum (BP), Procter & Gamble (P&G) and the Walt Disney Company, managing their regional affairs from within Turkey. In addition to advantages in business management, multinational companies prefer Turkey for investments, production, exports and logistics, primarily choosing to manage dynamic markets in the Middle East, North Africa, Eastern Europe and Central Asia from their Turkish headquarters. Istanbul is regarded as the epicenter for these developments in the country. Speaking to Anadolu Agency, Chairman of YASED Ahmet Erdem said the aforementioned regions generate about 10 percent of the global Gross Domestic Product (GDP), adding that Turkey is a top preference among international companies as a hub in the region, which contributes to Turkey's goals to become an investment hub in the region, as well.

Contact welchgroup.com   Albert Einstein said, "Compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world.  He who understands it, earns it...he who doesn't, pays it".  I agree with his statement but also believe most people don't really understand the magic of compounding.  About six months after starting my first post college graduation job, I started saving money from each paycheck with my bank.  Back then there weren't many investment options available so I started with a bank savings account.   At the time I conceptually understood the concept of compound interest but it was hard to 'internalize' the concept until I saw it actually happen in my savings account.  I invested $1,000 and earned 3% (yes, interest rates were higher back then) so one year later my account had $1,030.  The next year, instead of earning another $30, I earned $30 on the $1,000 plus I earned $0.90 on the $30 of interest from the year before.  It didn't seem like all that much at the time but as I also added money to the pot it began to grow surprisingly fast.  In fact, I used this savings plus borrowed some money from the bank to purchase my first piece of  real estate...a 4-plex apartment building and this simple act of saving 'consistently' helped launch my journey of wealth accumulation. The magic of compounding is simply earning money on your money and also earning money on the earnings on your money...over and over again.  Unfortunately, in 2008, our government began interfering in a significant way with interest rates.  While well intentioned, the effect has been to drive interest rates down to historical lows.  For example, historical rates for a 10-year treasury bond prior to 2008 was 4-5% while today the 10-year treasury is yielding a paltry 1.6%.  Compounding's Rich Uncle For most people, earnings at current interest rates, even with compounding, will not be enough to fund a retirement lifestyle anywhere near your current lifestyle.  An alternative approach is to blend compounding with the potential growth of the stock market.  This can be achieved with a basket of blue chip dividend-paying stocks.  As one example, look at Proctor & Gamble.  The current dividend yield is just over 3% annually.  More importantly, they have paid a dividend every year for over one-hundred years without missing.  They have also increased their dividend every year for the past 59 years.  Dividends also receive favorable tax treatment and are taxed at much lower rates than interest payments.  This is why I call companies like P&G 'Compounding's Rich Uncle'.  If you reinvest the dividend, you're getting the benefit of compounding and since they are raising their dividend payout every year, eventually their stock price also has to rise. Compounding's Evil Twin Compound interest is a two-sided coin.  On the one side are all the positive effects we discussed above.  The other side is what happens to you when you borrow money.  Let's assume there's a special offer to purchase an appliance for your home for $1,000 with no payments for three years and an interest rate of 21%.  Compound interest is now working against you in a big way.  In fact, when your payment comes due in five years, you'll owe over $1,800!  In our financial advisory practice, we see some version of this play out just about every week in the form of auto loans, credit card debt, store credit debt, and even home equity lines of credit and mortgages.  As managers of our family's finances, it's incumbent of each of us to understand how compounding works and manage it in a way that benefits us rather than enslaves us.   Business resources Read and post business press releases Sign up for free daily business news emails Most Read Active Discussions About Us About Alabama Media Group Jobs at Alabama Media Group Advertise with us News In Education Frequently Asked Questions About AL.com Contact Us Online Store Already a Subscriber?

In May, the client consolidated its digital and social media work with that unit, dropping R/GA and VaynerMedia from its roster in the process. “Every once in a while, you are lucky enough to get a team who not only does great work themselves, but gets great work out of everybody around them. That’s Susan and Daniela. We couldn’t be prouder and more excited about their promotion,” McCann New York co-chief creative officer Sean Bryan said in a statement. Young spent over three and a half years as a creative director with Saatchi & Saatchi, where she worked on the 2013 Tide “Miracle Stain” Super Bowl campaign before leaving for McCann. Prior to that she served as a copywriter with W+K New York for nearly three years, KBS+ for five years and Nitro for a little over a year. Vojta joined McCann following four years Saatchi & Saatchi New York, where she served as an integrated creative director for four years, working with clients including P&G and Tide North America. She also worked as an associate creative director at KBS, where her clients included Target, Coca-Cola, Citibank, Kao Brands, Wendy’s and the Ad Council, and a senior art director with Publicis New York on the L’Oréal, Club Med and Citizen Watches accounts. “It is always a pleasure to have team members recognized for their contributions,” said Kathleen Hall, Microsoft’s corporate vice president of global advertising and media. “In this case, doubly so, when we have two power women bringing such great commitment, insight and creativity to our business. And, to have them both excel while delivering a baby each in the last year makes it even more special. Nothing can stop these two.” The promotions follow on the heels of McCann New York bolstering its creative and account teams with the additions of executive account director Peter Bracegirdle and executive creative directors Shayne Millington and Craig Love earlier this month. They also follow the agency winning lead agency and brand strategy duties for Chick-fil-A. < Previous Article Next Article > Advertisement Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

A report from Harbinger shows which ads have resonated most with women, as well as when they are tuning in to the games. By Val Maloney August 17, 2016 Women are more likely to tune into the opening and closing ceremonies during the Olympics, while men reported watching more of the finals during the Games. Those stats are part of an online survey done by Harbinger, which polled 1,514 Canadian Angus Reid panellists. The online survey was followed by a couch session on Aug. 10, which asked women aged 24 to 63 to view a series of nine Olympic-related ads appearing on Canadian TV, or available for online viewing in Canada. Of the ads, P&G’s “Thank You, Mom – Strong” was chosen as the most memorable, followed by Samsung’s “The Anthem” and Sport Chek’s “Olympic Manifesto.” “One constant we saw among all of the top ads is that they contain underlying themes that speak to women’s own values and experiences with messages that transcend the Olympics themselves,” Deborah Adams, SVP and managing director, Harbinger, stated in a release on the study. In addition to being more likely to watch the opening and closing ceremony, women (35%) were also more likely than men (28%) to report watching the medal ceremonies during the Olympics. To date 30.4 million Canadians have watched at least part of Olympics coverage on TV or online, according to numbers from CBC/Radio-Canada.

Energy companies rose with the price of oil, but stocks have been locked in an up-and-down pattern for more than a week. As the dollar weakened, the price of oil rose for the fourth day in a row to sustain a recent recovery and metals prices also rose. The Labor Department said inflation remains low, as prices paid by consumers were unchanged in July. Most stocks were down, but for the second day in a row, the biggest losses went to traditionally safe investments like telecom and utility companies. Bond prices also inched lower. The dollar has been very strong over the last few years compared to other currencies. Early this year it looked like the dollar would stay at those elevated levels because the Federal Reserve was raising interest rates while other global central banks were cutting them to stimulate their economies. John Cannally, chief economic strategist for LPL Financial, said the Fed has changed course. By leaving interest rates where they are, it has allowed the currency to weaken a bit, aiding U.S. manufacturing and energy companies and other exporters. “The Fed is using the dollar as sort of a tool of monetary policy,” he said. “The Fed wants to give China and emerging markets time to heal and get their houses in order.” The Dow Jones industrial average lost 84.03 points, or 0.5 percent, to 18,552.02. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index slid 12 points, or 0.5 percent, to 2,178.15. The Nasdaq composite fell 34.90 points, or 0.7 percent, to 5,227.11. Stocks have been setting records recently, but it’s been more than a week since they rose for two days in a row. The market hasn’t made many big moves over the last month. The Labor Department said prices paid by consumers were unchanged in July as gas and other energy prices kept inflation down. Core inflation, which leaves out food and fuel prices, inched up just 0.1 percent for the month. Overall, inflation is up just 0.8 percent over the last year. That’s far below the 2-percent target set by the Federal Reserve, and investors concluded that means the Fed is less likely to raise interest rates soon. The dollar fell to 100.25 yen from 101.25 yen. The euro rose to $1.1277 from $1.1183. The weakening dollar boosted energy and metals prices Tuesday. Benchmark U.S. crude added 84 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $46.58 per barrel in New York. Brent crude, a benchmark used to price international oils, rose 88 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $49.23 a barrel in London. Oil prices climbed last week after steep losses in June and July. That aided companies like pipeline operator Kinder Morgan, which rose 48 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $21.78. Apache Corp. added $1.09, or 2.2 percent, to $50.97. Metals prices also rose. Gold gained $9.40 to $1,456.90 an ounce. Silver added 3 cents to $19.87 an ounce. Copper edged up 2 cents to $2.17 a pound. Bond prices dipped and the yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 1.58 percent from 1.56 percent. Stocks have wavered lately as investors review mixed reports about the U.S. economy as they try to get a sense of its health. On Tuesday the Federal Reserve said U.S. factories cranked out more autos, machinery and chemicals in July, which suggests manufacturers might be recovering, though growth remains little changed from a year ago and manufacturers aren’t adding many jobs. Meanwhile the Commerce Department said the pace of home construction grew by the most since February. Tea maker Hain Celestial Group delayed its quarterly report because of accounting issues and said it doesn’t expect to reach its financial projections for the year. The stock tumbled $14.05, or 26.3 percent, to $39.35. Uniform maker Cintas said it will buy G&K Services, a uniform and facility services maker, for $97.50 a share, or $1.93 billion. G&K Services advanced $14.57, or 17.7 percent, to $96.70 and Cintas stock gained $5.57, or 5.2 percent, to $112.99. Beauty products maker Coty posted results that surpassed expectations, but said little about its purchase of Procter & Gamble’s beauty business, a $15 billion deal expected to close in the next few months. Coty said it’s “premature” to comment on how the combined business will do. The stock skidded $1.47, or 4.9 percent, to $28.28. TJX, the parent of T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and other stores, traded lower after saying higher wages and the strong dollar will hurt its results in the third quarter. Its stock gave up $4.80, or 5.8 percent, to $77.97. Dick’s Sporting Goods announced better-than-expected quarterly results and raised its projections for the year. Its stock jumped $3.87, or 6.1 percent, to $58.76. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline rose 2 cents to $1.42 a gallon. Heating oil picked up 1 cent to $1.46 a gallon. Natural gas gained 3 cents to $2.62 per 1,000 cubic feet. The CAC 40 in France shed 0.8 percent and Britain’s FTSE 100 lost 0.7 percent. Germany’s DAX fell 0.6 percent. Japan’s Nikkei 225 slid 1.6 percent as the yen gained against the U.S. dollar. South Korea’s Kospi took a 0.1-percent loss and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index was down 0.1 percent.     Tags: percent, prices, dollar, cents, other, stock, Other stories from today: Ford to invest $75M in autonomous vehicle sensor company Stocks slip from records as investors sell safe picks Insurers continue to abandon ACA exchanges, limiting choice     Print this Page  |  << Back   Return To Archives            Daily Journal Quick Poll   For what are you most thankful?

More than 200 women are involved in a class-action lawsuit with Chaz Dean Inc. and distributor Guthy-Renker over claims that Wen by Chaz Dean Cleansing Conditioner led to hair loss, hair breakage, rash, and balding. The New York Times reports that Guthy-Renker has agreed to a $26.25 million settlement but it’s not yet been approved by a federal judge. If approved, the settlement would repay $25 to anyone who’s purchased a bottle of the cleansing conditioner and up to $20,000 to people who experienced adverse reactions; they can make claims to be reimbursed for treating said reactions as well as for injury awards. Guthy-Renker stands by the product, citing studies that it believes demonstrates that the product does not cause hair loss, and instead characterized the pending settlement as a “business decision.” Last month, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a safety alert for the cleansing conditioner but that’s about all it can do here — it doesn’t have the power to order recalls of cosmetics like it can with pharmaceuticals. Rather, the FDA monitors complaints submitted on its web site and decides whether to investigate. The agency could take action if it found that a product was mislabeled or contaminated. Proposed legislation from Senators Dianne Feinstein and Susan Collins would require cosmetic companies to notify the FDA of “serious adverse” reactions as they happen as well as submit an annual report of all “adverse events” and would give the FDA recall power. The bill would collect fees to study the safety of cosmetics ingredients and has been endorsed by major companies like Estée Lauder, Johnson & Johnson, and Procter & Gamble. Some independent companies like Mary Kay* support an alternative bill that would still require notification of injuries but would not collect money for safety evaluations or allow the FDA to order recalls. This fight will not be settled anytime soon. *This post has been updated to reflect that while Guthy-Renker is a dues-paying member of the Independent Cosmetic Manufacturers and Distributors (ICMAD), which drafted the alternative legislation with Mary Kay, Guthy-Renker does not have a public stance on any proposed legislation relating to the FDA.

Water scarcity is a growing environmental concern across the world, with only about 0.01% of the total water available for immediate consumption. So, vendors of liquid detergents, such as P&G, Unilever, and Henkel, are focusing on introducing concentrated liquid detergents. Compared to standard liquid detergents that have an average water content of 65%-70%, concentrated formats contain only 5%-50% water. According to the report, high demand for fragrance will be a key driver for market growth. The scent of the product is one of the leading factors influencing the purchase of household detergents.

At 10:17 IST, the Sensex, was up 25.84 points or 0.09% at 28,090.45. The Nifty was currently down 1.40 points or 0.02% at 8,641.15. The Sensex rose 71.49 points, or 0.25% at the day's high of 28,136.10 in early trade. The index fell 40.25 points, or 0.14% at the day's low of 28,024.36 at the onset of trading session. The Nifty index rose 15.05 points, or 0.17% at the day's high of 8,657.60 in early trade. The index fell 16 points, or 0.19% at the day's low of 8,626.55 at the onset of trading session. The market breadth indicating the overall health of the market was strong. On BSE, 1,178 shares rose and 761 shares fell. A total of 113 shares were unchanged. The BSE Mid-Cap index was currently up 0.34%. The BSE Small-Cap index was currently up 0.47%. Both these indices outperformed the Sensex. In overseas stock markets, Asian shares were mixed today, 17 August 2016, after New York Fed President William Dudley said the Fed could raise interest rates as soon as September, prompting investors to pause after rallies in recent weeks. US stocks eased from record highs yesterday, 16 August 2016, with the S&P 500 losing 0.55% as investors weighed hawkish comments by Federal Reserve officials against sharp gains for oil futures, a weakening dollar and fresh consumer-price data that showed US inflation remains tepid. Dudley said a rate hike in September was possible, while Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart said the US economy is likely strong enough for at least one rate increase before the end of 2016, with two a possibility. Dudley cited evidence of wage gains and a tighter labor market that could boost inflation. Their comments came ahead of an annual meeting of central bankers from around the world in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, next week. Metal shares were mixed. Vedanta (up 1.59%), Hindalco Industries (up 1.36%), National Aluminium Company (up 0.95%), Tata Steel (up 0.75%), Hindustan Copper (up 0.70%), Steel Authority of India (up 0.54%) and NMDC (up 0.20%), edged higher. Jindal Steel & Power (down 0.06%), Bhushan Steel (down 0.37%), JSW Steel (down 0.38%) and Hindustan Zinc (down 0.77%), edged lower. Meanwhile, copper price edged lower in the global commodities markets. High Grade Copper for September 2016 delivery was currently down 0.28% at $2.166 per pound on the COMEX. Most FMCG shares edged higher. Britannia Industries (up 1.53%), Dabur India (up 0.80%), Jyothy Laboratories (up 0.69%), GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare (up 0.68%), Tata Global Beverages (up 0.65%), Colgate Palmolive (India) (up 0.60%), Hindustan Unilever (up 0.21%) and Nestle India (up 0.04%), edged higher. Godrej Consumer Products (down 0.11%), Marico (down 0.37%), Bajaj Corp (down 0.46%) and Procter & Gamble Hygiene & Health Care (down 0.66%), edged lower. Piramal Enterprises (PEL) rose 1.96% after the company's announcement that its wholly owned US subsidiary has entered into an agreement to acquire 100% stake in Ash Stevens Inc, a US-based contract development and manufacturing organisation (CDMO), in an all cash deal. PEL will pay $42.95 million for the acquisition. There will be additional earn-out consideration capped at $10 million, subject to achievement of certain EBITDA targets, payable over the next six months. The transaction is expected to be completed by end of August, PEL said. This acquisition adds niche potent molecule manufacturing capabilities to the portfolio of services offered by PEL's pharma solutions business, the company said. Ash Stevens reported revenue of about $18.3 million in FY 2015 (twelve months ended 30 September 2015). The announcement was made after market hours yesterday, 16 August 2016.

NEW YORK — Stocks slid Tuesday as investors continued to sell phone company and utility shares. Energy companies rose with the price of oil, but stocks have been locked in an up-and-down pattern for more than a week. As the dollar weakened, the price of oil rose for the fourth consecutive day to sustain a recent recovery. Metals prices rose as well. The Labor Department said inflation remains low, as prices paid by consumers were unchanged in July. Most stocks were down, but for the second day in a row, the biggest losses went to traditionally safe investments such as telecom and utility companies. Bond prices also inched lower. The dollar has been very strong during the past few years compared with other currencies. This year it looked like the dollar would stay at those elevated levels because the Federal Reserve was raising interest rates while other global central banks were cutting them to stimulate their economies. John Cannally, chief economic strategist for LPL Financial, said the Fed has changed course. By leaving interest rates where they are, it has allowed the currency to weaken a bit, aiding manufacturing and energy companies and other exporters. “The Fed is using the dollar as sort of a tool of monetary policy,” he said. “The Fed wants to give China and emerging markets time to heal and get their houses in order.” The Dow Jones industrial average lost 84.03 points, or 0.5 percent, to 18,552.02. The Standard & Poor's 500 index slid 12 points, or 0.5 percent, to 2,178.15. The Nasdaq composite fell 34.90 points, or 0.7 percent, to 5,227.11. Stocks have been setting records recently, but it's been more than a week since they rose for two consecutive days. The market has not made many big moves during the past month. The Labor Department said prices paid by consumers were unchanged in July as gas and other energy prices kept inflation down. Core inflation, which leaves out food and fuel prices, inched up just 0.1 percent for the month. Overall, inflation is up just 0.8 percent over the past year. That's far below the 2 percent target set by the Fed, and investors concluded that means the Fed is less likely to raise interest rates soon. The dollar fell to 100.25 yen from 101.25 yen. The euro rose to $1.1277 from $1.1183. The weakening dollar boosted energy and metals prices. Benchmark U.S. crude added 84 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $46.58 per barrel in New York. Brent crude, a benchmark used to price international oils, gained 88 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $49.23 a barrel in London. Oil prices climbed last week after steep losses in June and July. That aided companies like pipeline operator Kinder Morgan, which increased 48 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $21.78. Apache Corp. added $1.09, or 2.2 percent, to $50.97. Metals prices also rose. Gold gained $9.40 to $1,456.90 an ounce. Silver added 3 cents to $19.87 an ounce. Copper edged up 2 cents to $2.17 a pound. Bond prices dipped, and the yield on the 10-year Treasury note went up to 1.58 percent from 1.56 percent. Stocks have wavered lately as investors review mixed reports about the nation's economy and try to get a sense of its health. The Federal Reserve said Tuesday that factories cranked out more vehicles, machinery and chemicals in July, which suggests manufacturers might be recovering, though growth remains little changed from a year ago and manufacturers aren't adding many jobs. Meanwhile the Commerce Department said the pace of home construction grew by the most since February. Tea maker Hain Celestial Group delayed its quarterly report because of accounting issues and said it doesn't expect to reach its financial projections for the year. The stock tumbled $14.05, or 26.3 percent, to $39.35. Uniform maker Cintas said it will buy G&K Services, a uniform and facility services maker, for $97.50 a share, or $1.93 billion. G&K Services advanced $14.57, or 17.7 percent, to $96.70 and Cintas stock gained $5.57, or 5.2 percent, to $112.99. Beauty products maker Coty posted results that surpassed expectations, but it said little about its purchase of Procter & Gamble's beauty business, a $15 billion deal expected to close in the next few months. Coty said it's “premature” to comment on how the combined business will do. The stock skidded $1.47, or 4.9 percent, to $28.28. TJX, the parent of T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and other stores, traded lower after saying higher wages and the strong dollar will hurt its results in the third quarter. Its stock gave up $4.80, or 5.8 percent, to $77.97. Dick's Sporting Goods announced better-than-expected quarterly results and raised its projections for the year. Its stock jumped $3.87, or 6.1 percent, to $58.76. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline rose 2 cents to $1.42 a gallon. Heating oil picked up 1 cent to $1.46 a gallon. Natural gas gained 3 cents to $2.62 per 1,000 cubic feet. The CAC 40 in France shed 0.8 percent, and Britain's FTSE 100 lost 0.7 percent. Germany's DAX fell 0.6 percent. Japan's Nikkei 225 slid 1.6 percent as the yen gained against the U.S. dollar. South Korea's Kospi took a 0.1-percent loss, and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index was down 0.1 percent.

While most comments will be posted if they are on-topic and not abusive, moderating decisions are subjective. We will make them as carefully and consistently as we can. Because of the volume of reader comments, we cannot review individual moderation decisions with readers. We value thoughtful comments representing a range of views that make their point quickly and politely. We make an effort to protect discussions from repeated comments â either by the same reader or different readers. We follow the same standards for taste as the daily newspaper. A few things we won't tolerate: personal attacks, obscenity, vulgarity, profanity (including expletives and letters followed by dashes), commercial promotion, impersonations, incoherence, proselytizing and SHOUTING. Don't include URLs to Web sites. We do not edit comments. They are either approved or deleted. We reserve the right to edit a comment that is quoted or excerpted in an article. In this case, we may fix spelling and punctuation. We welcome strong opinions and criticism of our work, but we don't want comments to become bogged down with discussions of our policies and we will moderate accordingly. We appreciate it when readers and people quoted in articles or blog posts point out errors of fact or emphasis and will investigate all assertions. But these suggestions should be sent via e-mail. To avoid distracting other readers, we won't publish comments that suggest a correction. Instead, corrections will be made in a blog post or in an article.

(Photo: The Enquirer/Bob Free)Buy Photo For the Enquirer’s 175th anniversary this year, we are digging into our archives to showcase historic photographs that capture the people, places, events and character of this community that we have chronicled and been a part of the past 175 years.   In the middle of the last century, Cincinnati, like nearly every American city, underwent a period of urban renewal. As people spread outside of the city basin to the suburbs on the hills, Downtown was remade. Outdated and out-of-style buildings were torn down to be replaced by modern brick and glass structures. The Downtown section from Sixth and Walnut streets to the Ohio River had been known as the Bottoms, a blue-collar neighborhood of diverse ethnic makeup—Irish, German, and African-American. People lived there, worked there, and worshipped there. In April 1955, the city was in transition. A block had been cleared for Procter & Gamble to construct their new headquarters at Sixth and Sycamore streets. A block away on Broadway, the century-old Allen Temple AME Church, an African-American church, was a relic of an older, completely different Cincinnati. The Moorish-style church with round-topped minarets and bell-arch motif, was built for the K.K. Bene Israel synagogue in 1852. Allen Temple worshipped there from 1870 to 1979, when the church was torn down to make way for the P&G towers. The Cincinnati of old slowly disappeared.

AT&T's 'Close to Home' Credit: AT&T Most Popular AT&T has consolidated its creative, digital and media accounts with Omnicom after a relatively swift holding-company level review that began in June. Omnicom will be responsible for the vast majority of AT&T's creative, media, digital, data and analytics in the U.S., though a spokesman said the scope includes Mexico. BBDO will take the lead on creative, which includes brand work for AT&T and DirecTV; Hearts & Science, a recently launched media agency, will be the carrier's new media agency. "We have selected Omnicom via its BBDO and Hearts & Science units to be AT&T's integrated creative and media agency," said Lori Lee, senior executive VP and global marketing officer at AT&T, in a statement. Ms. Lee was named to that role in 2015. "Omnicom has brought together one dedicated team representing the best talent across Omnicom to work seamlessly with us to position AT&T as the world's premier integrated communications company. A single integrated team allows us to move quickly, innovate at scale and take a data-driven, holistic approach to reaching consumers and businesses." In the statement, Ms. Lee also said that Omnicom's "capabilities are important as we get ready to launch new streaming video entertainment choices that are built for mobile." When AT&T launched the review in June, the company said that it was looking for "efficiencies, quality and consistency across the portfolio." Because it had been working with Omnicom's BBDO on creative for the AT&T brand, and WPP's Grey for DirecTV and MEC for Media, the nation's second-largest advertiser only invited those two holding companies to pitch for the business. MediaLink oversaw the process. Ms. Lee said in the statement today that "we believe this integrated, best-in-class approach is the future for brands wanting breakthrough marketing innovation, quality and efficiency at scale." Not affected by the review was multicultural creative, which is handled by multiple agencies. Cricket, AT&T's smaller wireless brand, will remain at Argonaut for creative work, but media buying, previously handled by MEC, will move to Hearts & Science. BBDO and MEC have been working with AT&T since 2007. Grey had been handling DirecTV since 2010. MEC's mobile carrier experience extends overseas, where it won the international Vodafone account in 2014. At the time, AT&T was rumored to be eyeing a Vodafone acquisition. "Like Omnicom, WPP is a world-class group and we appreciate their hard work and nine-year partnership," said Ms. Lee in the statement. In a statement, Omnicom said "we are extremely pleased to have won the business and look forward to continue working with AT&T." A WPP spokesman said simply: "We are very disappointed." Grey, in a separate statement, said: "We have had a fantastic run on DirecTV and have been privileged to help grow that brand with years of award-winning campaigns that struck a chord in pop culture. We wish AT&T and their agency partners continued success."

The campaign branched out to include sports stars. MEC released a statement saying: "We are of course extremely disappointed with this outcome. We had a strong and tenured relationship with AT&T, a rarity in this day and age. From winning the first ever Cannes Media Lion, the immense amount of talent driving forward so many award-winning industry-first innovations across digital and data, leaves us proud of the work we have delivered over the years together. We wish AT&T the best of luck in their future direction." AT&T has a lengthy roster of agencies, and while the fate of each individual agency was not immediately known, the spokesman said "we'll continue to use some independent agencies where needed." A couple Publicis agencies, such as Razorfish and Sapient have also been on the roster, though their fate was immediately unclear. The result is a big blow to WPP, although MEC earlier this month won the media account for Hertz in North America to act as the lead agency across the company's agency partners. For Omnicom, the win not only lets BBDO keep its AT&T work, but brings in the DirecTV creative that had been at Grey. It's also a big coup for Hearts & Science, which officially launched earlier this year to house the Procter & Gamble media work, which Omnicom won the bulk of in December 2015. The review is one of the largest to occur in years. Only Procter & Gamble spends more than AT&T in the U.S. In 2015, the carrier spent a total of $3.87 billion on both measured and unmeasured media, according to data analyzed by Ad Age's DataCenter. Prior to the review and after AT&T acquired DirecTV in July 2015, the company had been holding a series of jump balls for project work, which often resulted in BBDO and Grey pitching against one another to create campaigns for projects. WPP couldn't immediately be reached for comment.
