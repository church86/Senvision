Baker (Staff Writer) / Published: October 13, 2012 Article Tools Font size – + Share This     The Citizens' Voice file Joseph Bartorillo of Larksville was convicted of tampering with a consumer product, indecent assault and stalking for injecting semen into his co-workers' yogurt. The victims in a yogurt tampering case that brought about convictions in Wyoming County and federal courts against a fellow employee, have filed a lawsuit against their employer, Procter & Gamble. Sara Michaels, of Laceyville, and Teresa Davenport, of Wyalusing, filed the lawsuit through their attorney James Carroll Jr. in Bradford County Court, alleging that P&G intentionally inflicted emotional distress, negligently inflicted emotional distress and violated the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act. Earlier this year, Larksville resident Joseph Bartorillo was sentenced to two years in federal prison for tampering with a consumer product. In March, he also was sentenced in Wyoming County Court to six months in state prison on two charges of indecent assault and two charges of stalking. He is incarcerated in a federal penitentiary in Lisbon, Ohio. According to the suit, Michaels reported seven specific instances of yogurt tampering to P&G, while Davenport reported one. It claims P&G "failed in its duty to protect its employees by not adequately monitoring the work place, either before the incidents took place, but more importantly, after P&G was informed that someone was tampering with employee lunches." The lawsuit charges that both plaintiffs "suffered severe psychological injuries, fear, suspicion, invasion of privacy and severe emotional distress" and have had to undergo medical testing and psychological counseling. Alex Fried, spokesman for the P&G-Mehoopany plant, said he couldn't comment on pending litigation. "But, what I can tell you," Fried said, "is that the safety of our employees is of utmost importance, and as soon as we were made of aware of the incident, we investigated and sought the assistance of law enforcement." Michaels, who worked in information technology at Procter & Gamble in Washington Township until about two months ago, claims that on July 9, 2010, she made her first report to the P&G security office that her lunches had been tampered with. Davenport, another IT worker who is still employed at P&G and did not know Michaels well, said she made her first complaint to a yogurt company on Aug. 25, 2010. "Despite plaintiffs' repeated requests for concrete action, such as security cameras, etc., nothing concrete was done by P&G security or management," the suit alleges and no samples were sent to a testing lab until November. The lawsuit notes the last incident took place a full 326 days after Michaels' first report to P&G security. Because the plaintiffs believe P&G's actions were intentional, willful, wanton, reckless and indifferent conduct" they are seeking in excess of the local arbitration limit of $30,000, exclusive of court costs and punitive damages on a charge of intentional infliction of emotional distress. The plaintiffs are also charging Bartorillo with a count of assault and battery and another of intentional infliction of emotional distress and seeking a judgment in excess of local arbitration limits in each matter. bbaker@wcexaminer.com We welcome user discussion on our site, under the following guidelines: To comment you must first create a profile and sign-in with a verified DISQUS account or social network ID.

Services JobsBusiness DirectoryLocal InfoDatingBuy SellBook an Ad As an industry, we have always believed in transparency, trust and value Show caption () View gallery Skip to next image » 0 comments The chairman of Local Media Works, Craig Nayman, explains why the battle against fake news is so important. Local Media Works is the marketing arm of the News Media Association - the voice of national, regional and local news media organisations in the UK. -- Next week, local newspapers across the UK will celebrate their trusted role at the heart of communities during the annual Local Newspaper Week. It is a time for local news brands to join with their customers and readers and shout unashamedly about the unique strengths of local press in all its print and digital forms. High levels of trust –more important than ever in the run up to the General Election - and reader engagement are two key assets possessed by local papers. And they are needed now more than ever before. Big brands are deeply concerned about the potential reputational risks associated with blind programmatic buying of digital advertising. Procter & Gamble, the world’s biggest advertiser, has pulled billions of spend because it is worried about the lack of transparency. Sir Martin Sorrell has issued a warning to Google and Facebook that they need to get their act together to address brand safety and fake news online. He said that the dominance of those two companies has led to clients seeking alternative ways to reach audiences. The global tech platforms have failed to protect brands from appearing alongside hugely damaging content. All of this should put trust and context at a premium. Local news brands, in print and online, offer advertisers a highly-trusted environment free from the risks associated with other platforms. As they scrutinise spend, advertisers and agencies must remember this and reallocate budget to local news brands. We deliver scale, reaching 40 million people a week in print and online, and we drive real action. Our website content is trusted almost three times more than social media content. What’s more, advertisers who use news brands are supporting the creation of high quality journalism rather than an aggregator who invests nothing in content but still profits from its distribution. The siphoning off of ad revenues by third parties in this way is bad for journalism and bad for democracy. In uncertain times, news media journalism is needed more than ever to separate fact from fiction and give audiences the facts. In the run up to Local Newspaper Week, local papers have come to make this point through the pan industry Fighting Fake News campaign. Prime Minister Theresa May is one of several high-profile figures to intervene and state the importance of trusted local journalism in combating fake news. Yesterday, as part of the campaign, hundreds of local papers are ran a Trusted News Day in which they sought the views of their readers about the importance of trusted local journalism. As part of this, it is essential for advertisers to understand that local news brands offer a clear alternative to the opacity and uncertainty of digital advertising. Using local newsbrands means an advertiser will know exactly when and where their brand will appear, and that the message will drive consumer action. As an industry, we have always believed in transparency, trust and value, and our readers and customers expect nothing less from us. These values are at the very core of what we do and will continue to be so for many years to come. 0 comments Most popular See more stories Most popular See more stories Comments Sorry, an error occurred.

Services JobsBusiness DirectoryLocal InfoDatingBuy SellBook an Ad PICTURES: Tories tighten grip on County Hall at Wiltshire Council elections: roundup and full results Show caption () View gallery Skip to next image » Skip to next image » Skip to next image » Skip to next image » / Joe Riddle / @journaljoe 0 comments CONSERVATIVES secured seven extra Wiltshire Council seats on Friday as the party tightened its grip on County Hall. The Tories dominated at the polls, claiming 68 seats, including three key victories in the south. Sven Hocking (Con) ousted long-serving Ian Tomes (Lab) in Salisbury St Martins and Cathedral. Cllr Hocking thanked his rival for his years of service and a “hard-fought campaign”. Peter Edge (Lib) thought he had held on to Wilton and Lower Wylye Valley by just 12 votes. But a recount found a bundle of 50 votes for Pauline Church (Con) in his pile, sealing a narrow victory for the Tories. Ms Church said: “I started on this journey in February, I just can’t believe what we’ve achieved.” And Darren Henry (Con) defeated veteran Ian West (Lib) in Till and Wylye Valley after 26 years. Brian Dalton (Lib) retained Harnham, Ricky Rogers (Lab) kept Bemerton and Ian McLennan (Lab) held Laverstock, Ford and Old Sarum. John Walsh (Lab), who won Fisherton and Bemerton Village by a single vote in 2013, extended his majority to 67, a lead he jokingly described as “comfortable”. And former Tory Chris Devine (Ind) won in Winterslow after being dropped by his party before the election. Elsewhere, Robert Yuill (Con) won back Amesbury East for the Tories after losing to 20-year-old student Jamie Capp (Lib) by just five votes at a by-election in 2016. John Smale (Con) stood unopposed in Bulford, Allington and Figheldean, the only uncontested seat in Wiltshire, after beating Martin Lee (Ind) by just six votes in 2013. Meanwhile, Independents Graham Wright (Durrington and Larkhill) and George Jeans (Mere) both won comfortably by more than 1,000 votes.

Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc (C) takes photo with entrepreneurs Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc made the pledge at a meeting on May 12 with representatives from 21 world leading companies from the US, Canada, Japan, the  Republic of Korea, the UK, Switzerland, Singapore and China’s Hong Kong, at the 26th World Economic Forum on ASEAN (WEF ASEAN) in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. He said doing business in Vietnam will give foreign investors access to not only a market with 93 million people in Vietnam but also the greater market of ASEAN and the world, as the country has signed 12 free trade agreements, and is pushing ahead with negotiations on four other pacts. The PM told the audience that Vietnam’s renewal process and open policies have helped domestic and foreign businesses reap success doing business in the country.  At the meeting, WEF Managing Director Philipp Roesler described the Mekong River region, including Vietnam, as a dynamic area with young population and urged  enterprises to invest in the region and create more jobs for young people.  Participating entrepreneurs recognized Vietnam’s high determination and efforts to reform and improve the business investment environment as well as the Government’s support for the foreign business community. The same day, PM Phuc attended a talk on Vietnam held by the WEF and Vinacapital, during which he said Vietnam strives to realize the average growth target of 6.5-7 percent from now to 2020. The country will push ahead with the improvement of the market economy institutions and strongly encourage the development of the private economic sector to become an  important driving force in the domestic economy, he said. He re-affirmed the resolve to build a development-facilitating government, restructure the economy and reform the country’s growth model. PM meets with business leaders on sidelines of WEF-ASEAN Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc met with leaders of major businesses on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum (WEF) on ASEAN 2017 in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, on May 12. Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc (R) meets with Doreen Steidle, Asia-Pacific Regional Head for Group Government Affairs with HSBC, in Phnom Penh While receiving Magesvaran Surajan, President of Asia Pacific Selling and Market Operations of the US’s Procter & Gamble (P&G) Company, PM Phuc highly evaluated the group’s business activities in Vietnam as well as its practical support and active participation in APEC events in 2017. He asked P&G to continue long-term investment in Vietnam so as to help bolster the country’s economic ties with the US. At a meeting with Linda Seah, Vice President of Ireland’s Shire Plc, PM Phuc hailed the group’s application of high technology in medical treatment in Vietnam. He also welcomed Shire Plc’s plan to expand its operations in the country in the time ahead. The Vietnamese leader also met with Doreen Steidle, Asia-Pacific Regional Head for Group Government Affairs with the UK’s HSBC, where he said the bank’s financial and banking services have helped improve competitiveness of Vietnam’s credit-banking system. He called on HSBC to cooperate with commercial banks of Vietnam to expand their overseas activities. Talking with Vice President of the US’s GE group Christian Bennett, PM Phuc applauded the firm’s investment expansion plan in Vietnam and its cooperation with Vietnamese partners in energy development. The PM also expressed his hope that GE will actively support activities within the APEC Year 2017 in Vietnam.

While earnings from a few heavyweights did not meet Street expectations, the momentum largely remained strong through the week on sustained foreign flows, thanks to a stronger rupee, which settled at 64.31 to the dollar for the week. The BSE Sensex jumped 329 points, or 1.10 per cent, during the week to settle at 30,188 on Friday while the Nifty50 rose 115, points, or 1.24 per cent, for the week to close at 9,400. Barring China's Shanghai Composite (down 0.63 per cent) and US' Dow Jones (down 0.53 per cent), major global equity indices rose up to 2.8 per cent, with Hong Kong's Hang Seng (0.78 per cent) and Japanese Nikkei (up 2.25 per cent) led the charge. Nymex crude prices rose 3.5 per cent for the week to $47.84 a barrel. Gold prices rose 0.6 per cent, while silver lost 2.11 per cent of value in the domestic market. Foreign inflows into equities stood at Rs 1,830 which outpaced the Rs 999.38 crore withdrawals by domestic institutional investors during the week. Here's a look at some of the stocks that hogged limelight during the day. Glenmark went on a scuba dive The stock ended 10.27 per cent lower for the week, thanks to a sharp 16.19 per cent plunge in its share price on Friday alone, which wiped out consecutive gains for the previous four days. A non-show by Zetia Generic, which had received 180-day exclusivity during the December quarter, resulted in less-than-expected fourth quarter numbers. YES, got hidden treasure? No, but huge NPAs This Yes Bank stock crashed 7.8 per cent last week. This includes four days of consecutive declines. In its annual report, the bank said its gross NPAs (nonperforming assets) after an RBI assessment for the fiscal year ended March 2016 stood at Rs 4,926 crore, more than six times the Rs 749 crore the bank had reported that year. HUDCO IPO proved a grand affair The Rs 1,200 crore initial public offering of Hudco received bids worth Rs 97,000 crore. This was the highest oversubscription in any PSU disinvestment. The issue was subscribed 79.49 times. The category reserved for qualified institutional buyers (QIBs) was oversubscribed 55.45 times while the non-institutional investor category saw a huge 330.36 times oversubscription. Now, wait for the listing day. Shilpi Cable Technologies: Falling like a ninepins Plunging for the 15th consecutive session, Shipli Cable Technologies on Friday closed at Rs 67.45, compared with Rs 225.70 level the stock had quoted on April 20. There are strong rumours that certain banned stock operators, who have been ousted from the market by the Securities and Exchange Board of India, have been active on the counter via front-trading entities The company on April 30 informed stock exchanges that an overseas bank had initiated insolvency and bankruptcy proceedings against it. Bharti jumped 6% despite 72% plunge in Q4 net This is strange. The stock jumped 5.88 per cent for the week, even the telecom operator reported a net profit of Rs 373 crore for the three months ended March, its smallest in four years and sharply lower than the average estimate of Rs 478 crore that analysts had made in an ET poll. Bharti blamed 'predatory pricing' by new entrant, Reliance Jio Infocomm, for the nearly 72 per cent year-on-year slump in fourth quarter net profit. When Jhunjhunwala quizzed InterGlobe The stock managed to post 2 per cent gain for the week. During the company's conference call post fourth quarter earnings, Jhunjhunwala quizzed the company's CFO, Rohit Philip, on precisely how the airline plans to address the issue of fluctuating fuel cost. The largest domestic airline operator by market share reported a 25 per cent year-on-year slump in March quarter profit at Rs 583 crore thanks mainly to a sharp rise in fuel costs. IMD forecast lifts FMCG stocks: Stocks such as ADF Foods (up 27 per cent), Gillette India (12.71 per cent), P & G Hygiene(8 per cent), Bajaj Hindusthan (7.74 per cent), Radico Khaitan (5.13 per cent), Godfrey Phillips(4.86 per cent), Britannia (4.85 per cent) and Eveready Inds (4.83 per cent) for the week. The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) on Tuesday said monsoon rainfall could be 'normal' and bring 100 per cent rainfall instead of 96 per cent as predicted earlier this year. God save PSU banks PSU banks continued their recent slide: Shares of 9 of 12 BSE PSU Bank index stocks fell during the week, as the recent ordinance enabling RBI to crack down on bad loans was expected to hit banks' bottomlines. Canara Bank, Union Bank, Oriental Bank, IDBI Bank, IOB and Punjab National Bank plunged up to 7 per cent during the week.
