Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 25 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Gartner Announces Rankings of the 2017 Supply Chain Top 25 PHOENIX–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Gartner, Inc. has released the findings from its annual Supply Chain Top 25, identifying supply chain leaders and highlighting their best practices. Analysts announced the results at the Gartner Supply Chain Executive Conference, which is being held this week at the JW Marriott Desert Ridge Resort and Spa in Phoenix, AZ. „2017 marks the 13th year of our annual Supply Chain Top 25 ranking,” said Stan Aronow, research vice president at Gartner. „This year we have an impressive group of leaders with new lessons to share, including two more recent entrants from the high-tech and consumer product sectors.” „Despite some striking performances, however, today’s supply chain leaders face a much different business environment than just 12 months ago,” said Mr. Aronow. „A general trend toward protectionism, as evidenced by Brexit and the policies of the current U.S. administration, has caused some companies to shift supply network design decisions and create contingency plans in anticipation of new trade policies. Continued investment in innovative supply chain capabilities will be required to meet this changing landscape.” Unilever topped the Supply Chain Top 25 ranking for the second consecutive year in 2017, followed by McDonald’s, Inditex, Cisco and H&M (see Table 1). Two new companies made the Supply Chain Top 25, with Nokia rejoining after a seven-year hiatus and Diageo making the list for the first time. Perennial supply chain leader Amazon joined Apple and P&G in qualifying for the „Masters” category, which Gartner introduced in 2015 to recognize sustained leadership over the last 10 years. „Hardly a day goes by without another announcement of Amazon’s foray into a new market, ownership of its own logistics capabilities or filing of patents to improve customer experience,” said Aronow. One indicator of Amazon’s outsized influence on retail is the simultaneous real estate boom in distribution centers and bust of brick and mortar stores in the U.S. over the past two years. Apple continues to improve and innovate both its solutions and the means of producing them. While the company has backed off plans to produce its own cars, it is still actively working on autonomous vehicle technology and experimenting with augmented reality (AR) technologies. Consumer product giant P&G continues to innovate through digital automation of workflows, and the use of algorithm-driven tools to reduce exceptions and enable end-to-end planning. In recent years, P&G has also accelerated its investment in people and environmental initiatives. Along with the Masters category, the Supply Chain Top 25 continues to offer a platform for insights, learning, debate and contributions to the rising influence of supply chain practices on the global economy.

Source: Gartner (May 2017) Three key trends stand out this year for the supply chain leaders that are accelerating their capabilities, separating them further from the rest of the pack. Digitalization of Supply Chain The past few years have seen a massive shift in companies creating digital connections within and across their supply chain operations. Leading companies view digitalization as an opportunity to not only provide agile support for existing products, but to reduce time to market for new ones. Some of the most disruptive and impactful technologies include solutions combining Internet of Things (IoT) sensors, cloud computing and advanced analytics. Simulation and optimization capabilities have moved into the mainstream and now cognitive computing capabilities, including machine learning, are in the labs of the most advanced supply chains. The digital pieces of the supply chain puzzle are coming together in a way that will enable more holistic, real-time management of the entire ecosystem. Adaptive Organizations and Capabilities Interrelated with digitalized supply chains is the ability of companies to be more adaptive to changes in their value chains. More specifically, leaders are creating adaptive organizations and capabilities to survive and win independent of future supply-related constraints or customer needs. „Some of the more impressive supply chain organizations have created a modular supply chain service model that allows for variants of functional capabilities to be combined into „plug-and-play” segments, such as make-to-stock, configure-to-order or engineer-to-order manufacturing profiles,” said Aronow. „This approach allows them to more quickly and flexibly support different business needs and outcomes, and speeds up activities such as M&A integration.” Developing and Fostering Healthy Ecosystems Leading companies realize that supply chain success depends on the health and well-being of the critical ecosystems within and around them. The people aspect of supply chain ecosystems applies to relationships with suppliers, partners, employees and customers along the value chain. Leading supply chains focus as much on ethical sourcing and supporting customer well-being, as they do on talent acquisition and development. Environmental sustainability is another priority for top supply chain organizations that set ambitious stewardship goals in the areas of emissions, water and other natural resources. Companies that are further along in developing mature corporate social responsibility (CSR) practices tend to have moved beyond mere regulatory compliance and are linking these efforts back to support for their underlying corporate strategies. Gartner clients can read more in „The Gartner Supply Chain Top 25 for 2017.” About the Gartner Supply Chain Top 25 The Supply Chain Top 25 rankings comprise two main components: business performance and opinion. Business performance in the form of public financial and CSR data provides a view into how companies have performed in the past, while the opinion component offers an eye to future potential and reflects leadership in the supply chain community. These two components are combined into a total composite score. Gartner analysts derive a master list of companies from a combination of the Fortune Global 500 and the Forbes Global 2000. In an effort to maintain the list of companies evaluated at a manageable level a general annual revenue threshold of $12 billion has been applied.

Source: Gartner (May 2017) Three key trends stand out this year for the supply chain leaders that are accelerating their capabilities, separating them further from the rest of the pack. Digitalization of Supply Chain The past few years have seen a massive shift in companies creating digital connections within and across their supply chain operations. Leading companies view digitalization as an opportunity to not only provide agile support for existing products, but to reduce time to market for new ones. Some of the most disruptive and impactful technologies include solutions combining Internet of Things (IoT) sensors, cloud computing and advanced analytics. Simulation and optimization capabilities have moved into the mainstream and now cognitive computing capabilities, including machine learning, are in the labs of the most advanced supply chains. The digital pieces of the supply chain puzzle are coming together in a way that will enable more holistic, real-time management of the entire ecosystem. Adaptive Organizations and Capabilities Interrelated with digitalized supply chains is the ability of companies to be more adaptive to changes in their value chains. More specifically, leaders are creating adaptive organizations and capabilities to survive and win independent of future supply-related constraints or customer needs. "Some of the more impressive supply chain organizations have created a modular supply chain service model that allows for variants of functional capabilities to be combined into "plug-and-play" segments, such as make-to-stock, configure-to-order or engineer-to-order manufacturing profiles," said Aronow. "This approach allows them to more quickly and flexibly support different business needs and outcomes, and speeds up activities such as M&A integration." Developing and Fostering Healthy Ecosystems Leading companies realize that supply chain success depends on the health and well-being of the critical ecosystems within and around them. The people aspect of supply chain ecosystems applies to relationships with suppliers, partners, employees and customers along the value chain. Leading supply chains focus as much on ethical sourcing and supporting customer well-being, as they do on talent acquisition and development. Environmental sustainability is another priority for top supply chain organizations that set ambitious stewardship goals in the areas of emissions, water and other natural resources. Companies that are further along in developing mature corporate social responsibility (CSR) practices tend to have moved beyond mere regulatory compliance and are linking these efforts back to support for their underlying corporate strategies. Gartner clients can read more in "The Gartner Supply Chain Top 25 for 2017." About the Gartner Supply Chain Top 25 The Supply Chain Top 25 rankings comprise two main components: business performance and opinion. Business performance in the form of public financial and CSR data provides a view into how companies have performed in the past, while the opinion component offers an eye to future potential and reflects leadership in the supply chain community. These two components are combined into a total composite score. Gartner analysts derive a master list of companies from a combination of the Fortune Global 500 and the Forbes Global 2000. In an effort to maintain the list of companies evaluated at a manageable level a general annual revenue threshold of $12 billion has been applied.

My Profile My Subscriptions Log Out CBC News Opinion CBC News Navigation Home Opinion World Canada Politics Business Health Entertainment Technology & Science Video Home Opinion We want to run our business in Ontario. The government is making that incredibly difficult Hydro costs and crushing taxes almost pushed us to pick up and move By Jon Dwyer, for CBC News Posted: May 25, 2017 5:00 AM ET Last Updated: May 25, 2017 5:00 AM ET Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne speaks during a press conference in Toronto on March 2, 2017. The Liberal government unveiled its plan today to cut hydro bills, which are the biggest political issue it faces less than a year-and-a-half away from an election. (Frank Gunn/Canadian Press) About The Author Jon Dwyer Jon Dwyer is managing director of Aereus Technologies and a member of the City of Toronto innovation economy advisory council. Related Stories Ontario Liberals ask court to dismiss Hydro One suit arguing it's a political complaint, not a legal one Liberal hydro plan to cost $45B but will only save electricity ratepayers $24B, says watchdog Procter & Gamble to close Ontario plant and shift production to West Virginia I've long been proud to call Ontario my home, but unfortunately, it's an increasingly challenging place to do business. I'm the managing director of a bio-tech company that manufactures a proprietary antimicrobial copper alloy that kills dangerous bacteria and hospital-acquired infections such as MSRA and C. difficile. We are well capitalized and growing quite quickly, looking to build a new facility. Ontario should be the easy choice. But it isn't an easy decision. At all. The Ontario government makes it incredibly difficult to do business here. The news that Procter & Gamble is shuttering its Brockville, Ont. plant — laying off 500 workers — is just the latest evidence of that. Energy costs The first problem, of course, is the cost of energy. The rising cost of residential power has been discussed to death elsewhere; Ontario's Liberal government recently announced a 17 per cent cut to bills to try to undo some of the damage (too little, too late for those business that have already shuttered) though according to a report from the financial accountability officer, the province will actually spend $45 billion on the scheme to save $24 billion. Then there's the issue of tax competitiveness. As a bio-tech company, our workers are highly educated, mobile and always in demand. Crushing provincial income taxes make retaining our talent an incredible challenge. It keeps me up at night. Ontario businesses must fight the tech brain-drain to other markets such as Silicon Valley and Israel already. We need a government that helps Ontario companies retain talent, not one that makes it more difficult by virtue of an ever-increasing tax liability. Procter & Gamble to close Brockville, Ont., plant Liberal hydro plan to cost $45B but will only save electricity ratepayers $24B The list goes on. The high cost of real estate in the Greater Toronto Area — both for our employees to live and for our facility to exist — is a major disincentive to invest here, and one that is exacerbated by land transfer fees on both residences and commercial properties (Ontario hiked commercial land transfer fees by a third late last year). And then there's the politics. In recent years, the Wynne government has been eager to "invest" in all kinds of businesses that really didn't need any additional help beyond a level playing field and fairly applied rules. Handouts from governments looking to shore up their support are great if you're receiving the cheque. But if you don't win the government largess lottery, you can find yourself competing against not simply another group of savvy entrepreneurs, but savvy entrepreneurs backed by a provincial government that now has skin in the game. Paying off the debt The Liberals have been in power since 2003. The saying "power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely" comes to mind. The countless "mishaps," which led to billions of dollars lost, seem so surreal to private business owners, and it is so discouraging to try to thrive in a province where leadership has no concept of the value of a dollar. In keeping with that theme, the Liberals have also run up Ontario's debt — more than doubling it in their time in office — leaving the province as the most indebted sub-sovereign borrower in the world. Someone's going to have to pay for that debt eventually, and Ontario's business leaders have a sneaking suspicion it'll be them. Sticking with Ontario After months of considering Ontario locations for our facility, we began looking at other options, including parts of the American Rust Belt desperate to attract businesses. Taxes are low, power cheap, and the incentives — including sometimes literally cash incentives — were hard to ignore. But we've chosen to stick it out in Ontario. After considering what I've written above, you might think we are either crazy or stupid — perhaps both. But there's a method to our madness. Some of the reason is purely sentimental. My partners and I want to raise our families in Ontario, and we want to help provide high-quality, well-paying jobs in our province. There's also the issue of uncertainty right now in the United States — the hard work by states is being offset by concerns about the future of NAFTA and the free flow of capital and labour. Business owners in the Windsor region met to discuss strategies to reduce the high cost of energy in Ontario on Monday. It would be easy to pick up stake and simply plunk down our facility in the most convenient low-cost jurisdiction — indeed, we've spent many hours asking ourselves if our fiduciary duty demands exactly that. But there is often benefit in adversity. Ontario businesses continue to thrive. We exist in a climate where the cards are stacked against us, and we manage to compete globally, and very successfully at that. As such, Ontario businesses are robust, and their managers know how to thrive when they're in the trenches. In an increasingly interconnected global economy, there is no longer a steady-state where we can anticipate rational outcomes. Businesses are constantly forced to innovate and re-imagine their role in the marketplace, so why not invest in a province where businesses are forced to be twice as smart? We do so in spite of the government, not thanks to it. Our best allies are other, larger companies that have chosen to stick it out here, helped along by some smart politics at the municipal level. Companies such as Shopify, Hubba and Breather are thriving here. We don't have their scale, but we benefit from their example. So we are doubling down on Ontario. It's going to be hard, but worth it, we think. It would just be nice if we could count on our provincial government to pave the way for new businesses, instead of putting down obstacles.

Credit: P&G Most Popular It's no surprise that Procter & Gamble, which has been vocal in its displeasure with digital advertising, is planning to shift more of its marketing dollars back into TV during this year's upfront ad talks. Less expected, perhaps, is the double edge that carries for TV. While it would seem like a win for the TV networks, which have been losing share to digital behemoths like Facebook and Google, they might not actually want P&G's money. At least not as much as they'd like it from someone new. P&G is looking to meaningfully increase the volume of its ad commitments during the annual negotiation, where networks look to sell a bulk of their commercial inventory for the next season, according to both buyers and sellers who are familiar with the budding conversations. But the maker of Crest toothpaste and Downy detergent could find it hard to place all the additional money it would like. That's because P&G is one of several major marketers that have been grandfathered into legacy ad deals that reward marketers for decades of consistent business by guaranteeing relatively small price hikes on relatively low bases. TV networks are tired of those old deals and ultimately want to strike agreements with advertisers whom they can charge higher rates. Representatives of Procter & Gamble and TV networks declined to comment on their plans for upfront negotiations. When the market is weak, like in the 2009 recession, TV networks are happy to have these agreements in place, encouraging long-time big spenders to keep it up. But when business is robust, like last year, the deals leave little wiggle room for the networks to increase rates. Several major network groups actually turned away money from advertisers at the lower rates in 2016. "It will be tough for them to get that money down, though this year's marketplace should be a bit easier if the indications of down to flat budgets overall are accurate," one media buyer said. What the networks are willing to accept this year will depend on the health of the marketplace. Upfront negotiations are expected to truly kick off next week, and while it is still too early to predict how it will all play out, media buyers say overall budgets are expected to be flat to slightly down from last year. And broadcast is projected to fare better than cable. Advertisers are still getting their budgets in order, but there are indications that the retail and automotive categories will be weaker. Consumer packaged-goods and pharmaceuticals are expected to show more strength, but both of those categories typically have these legacy ad deals in place. The 2016 upfront marketplace was unusually healthy, with broadcasters snagging high-single-to-low-double-digit percentage increases in the cost to reach 1,000 viewers, an industry standard known as CPMs, and dollar volume up in the mid-single digits. While this year marketers might hold back more money to place closer to air time in the so-called scatter market, networks will certainly play up their reliability and brand safety at a time when marketers are seriously questioning digital advertising. It's what's bringing P&G back to TV. Marc Pritchard, P&G's chief brand officer, has been vocal about the need for digital to clean up its mess. In January, he gave a speech at the Interactive Advertising Bureau conference demanding industry-standard viewability metrics, fraud protections and third-party verification. At the time, he said come January 2018 P&G would stop paying for any digital media that didn't get its audiences measured by outside firms accredited by the Media Rating Council. Facebook and Google have begun the process of seeking MRC accreditation for their auditing processes, but it's not clear whether or when they will succeed. In an interview prior to another speech to an Association of National Advertisers Media Conference in March, Pritchard said the company has plenty of alternatives if digital players don't meet its demands. That leaves hundreds of millions of dollars in play. Historically lenient option terms for the giant advertiser could then allow P&G to pull back some of that upfront spending for use on digital media should the MRC accreditations come through.

Some of that business will come from a plant the company is closing in Ontario, Canada. P&G told 500 workers at its Brockville, Ont., plant Wednesday that it will permanently close the plant by late 2020 or early 2021 and move production to West Virginia, according to a report on CBC Radio Canada. The Brockville plant has been in operation for nearly 40 years. The company told the workers it’s been studying its North America supply chain for several years. The CBC report quoted Procter & Gamble spokesperson Jeff LeRoy. “News like this is never easy. We wanted our employees who are our top priorities to go home and spend this time with their families, their friends, their loved ones, and talk about it. Talk about what they wanted to do with their future.” The Brockville plant produces Swiffer dusters, fabric softeners and Tide-to-go detergent pens. It appears at least the Swiffer brand will be produced at the Tabler Station plant under construction in Martinsburg. U.S. Senator Joe Manchin welcomed the news in a Thursday statement. “Today’s announcement further underscores the long-term commitment this world-class company has made in our state and our workforce. Manufacturing jobs will carry our economy forward, and help keep more West Virginians in West Virginia – raising children, supporting families, and making lasting contributions to our communities,” Manchin said. P&G has already announced it will produce Pantene, Head & Shoulders, Olay, Old Spice and Bounce at the Martinsburg facility. The Martinsburg plant is expected to have about 700 workers. The addition of Swiffer products does not change those projections, Leroy told MetroNews Thursday.

Skip to main content asia one Latest Singapore Malaysia China Asia World MORE All Sections BUSINESS ENTERTAINMENT TRAVEL DIGITAL FOOD HEALTH WOMEN Lottery Results Horoscope Chinese Zodiac Currency Converter Follow Us Latest Singapore Malaysia China Asia World Business Showbiz Health Food Here are the top 10 companies that Singaporeans are dying to work for Retaining the top spot, Google now resides in a sprawling new Asia Pacific HQ in Singapore which opened just last year, and they are using the country as a hub to reach out to the region through research and development of existing and upcoming products. PHOTO: AFP M. Shazni Vulcan Post May 25, 2017 Ask any Singaporeans about their dream job and chances are, they would have dropped some familiar company names. Well, Jobstreet Singapore seeks to quantify these opinions, and are once again back with their annual Top Companies Survey, where some 1,200 participants were involved to help the job portal in their search for the 10 companies that Singaporeans wish to work for. Jobstreet Reveals The Top 10 Companies Singaporeans Want To Work For In the search for the Top Companies of the Year, companies were pegged on three underlying factors that employees tend to consider when searching for their next job - career development opportunities and basic salary, calibre of management and leadership team, work environment as well as company culture. Without further ado, here are the top 10 companies - in ascending order: 10. IBM As expected, American tech companies are a recurring theme in the list. First, we have IBM at the 10th spot. This multinational tech company replaces Keppel Corporation from last year's list to round off the top companies of 2017. While they are a name that consumers don't identify with anymore, businesses all over the world are still dependent on their portfolio of products - hardware, software, infrastructure, and cloud computing solutions. 9. Procter & Gamble and DBS Bank Making a comeback this year is American home and consumer hygiene manufacturer Procter & Gamble, which has successfully retained its spot from last year. While they continue to have a strong presence as a preferred employer locally and overseas, they are joined by DBS Bank for joint 9th this year. Being Euromoney's world's best digital bank and Aon Hewitt's leading employer in Asia, DBS is changing the way we look at banks. Besides just empowering employees with fulfilling careers, they are on a mission to create an environment where employees feel connected and valued as they progress in their career within the bank. They also have a holistic suite of people initiatives in place to help equip staff to be the best, and be the change and difference that they can be at every stage of their lives. Photo: Reuters 8. ExxonMobil This oil and gas corporation has a long history in our little island - all 120 years of it. With more than S$20 billion worth of assets in Singapore alone, ExxonMobil is one of the country's largest foreign investors. Singapore is also home to the company's largest integrated refining and petrochemical complex in the world, with a refinery that is churning out an amazing 592,000 barrels per day. Unfortunately though, they slipped two places in the rankings from their place last year, dropping from 6th to 8th. Photo: The Straits Times 7. Changi Airport Group We have the best airport in the world, so it's no surprise that there's an equally capable company running it behind the scenes. Changi Airport Group comes a place higher in 2017, taking them to 7th from 8th spot. They were also listed as the most attractive employer in 2016 by Randstad, which ranked them highly in areas like financial health, training, long-term job security, management, working atmosphere and environmental and social awareness. Photo: Reuters 6. Shell Descending one spot from their placing last year is the other oil and gas giant. Shell drops to 5th from 6th, but still retains its allure as one of the top companies that Singaporeans would want to work for. They were voted as the most attractive energy industry employer in 2015 in Asia by Universum. If you're a engineering or chemical engineering graduate, chances are, Shell is a company very familiar to you with their many initiatives with schools in Singapore. Shell also has progressive policies in place to create an inclusive environment in and out of the workplace. They have a flexi-working scheme that provides a range of options like flexible hours, compressed workweeks, part-time work and job sharing. Photo: The New Paper 5. Microsoft We talked about Bill Gates just yesterday; and if you didn't already know, here's the company he co-founded. Leaping two spots from 7th last year, Microsoft now occupies the 5th spot in 2017. The tech giant's Windows operating system continues to be a driving force for the company, and under current CEO Satya Nadella, the company is also bringing their hardware game to the next level with their Surface line of computers. If you have the opportunity to work at Microsoft, you'll be able to develop new products that can eventually have a global influence. Photo: The Straits Times 4. Singapore Airlines We are proud of our award-winning airport, and we are equally proud of our national airline as well. Having been inducted into the Randstad Hall of Fame in 2015 (a distinction that only 3 companies worldwide have) after being voted the most attractive company in Singapore from 2012 and 2014, it's no surprise that they're on this list as well. The airline was also named by Skytrax in 2016 as the best airline in Asia. This is a company that has always ranked high among Singaporeans - many have dreamt to be the venerable Singapore Girl, or the pilots sitting in the cockpit. Photo: Reuters 3. Apple Dropping from 2nd to 3rd, we have Apple, who are in the midst of preparing for the grand opening of their first-ever store in Singapore and Southeast Asia. They are known for their excessive attention to detail and an obsession to guard its innovative secrets, but once you get past that, you will see why Apple ranks highly as the company anyone wants to work for anywhere in the world. As an employee, you will work with like-minded individuals to create products that matter. It also helps that once you have the world's most valuable company on your resume, you will not need to look long for a job should you decide to leave. Photo: Reuters 2. Facebook Coming up two notches from last year's ranking is Facebook. There's no running away from the Facebook site and app. Led by Mark Zuckerberg, the company is making inroads to take over the world. Towards the end of 2016, Glassdoor ranked the company as the best place to work in tech. If you've noticed with these tech companies, having employees involved in work that has wide-scale impact seems to come out tops each time. And with Facebook being one of the world's most used app, you can be sure that you will have a hand at a global change. In the office, the company focuses on the strengths of employees based on what they love doing, what they are great at, and what Facebook actually needs. Their unique "Builder" culture helps to push the boundaries for positive change, where employees regularly gather to "hack" problems, create new ideas, and continuously improve the products they are building. Photo: AFP 1. Google Well, were you expecting someone else? Retaining the top spot, Google now resides in a sprawling new Asia Pacific HQ in Singapore which opened just last year, and they are using the country as a hub to reach out to the region through research and development of existing and upcoming products. If Google is at the top of your list, chances are, we don't have to say much to convince you that the tech company is arguably one of the best places to carve out a career. Aside from just looking for experienced individuals to join their Singapore team, they are also sowing the seeds for future generations with local initiatives like Code in the Community, where they sponsor free coding class for kids from underprivileged backgrounds. Just In Time For Graduation Season It's no secret that Singaporean millennials are well-educated and discerning. Not simply wanting a job, they seek a career that can help chart new milestones as their careers advance, all while feeling that the work they do carry a degree of impact and meaning. As this year's graduates prepare for their first big step into their future, having a dream company to work towards may just be enough motivation for them to carefully chart out their careers.

ADD TO PORTFOLIO ADD TO WATCHLIST SHARE YOUR OULOOK ChartsValuation & Peer ComparisonCommunity Buzz PEER COMPANIES HULGodrej Consumer ProductsDaburColgateBritannia IndustriesBritannia EXPAND TO VIEW ALL The stocks of six leading fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies have hit record highs in the past couple of weeks riding on good fourth quarter performances or on expectations that GST would bring them massive windfalls. HUL, ITC, Britannia Industries, Marico, Godrej Consumer Products (GCPL) and P&G Hygiene and Healthcare have all recorded highs in this month. Markets are largely bullish on consumer stocks underpinned by a demand pick-up in the offing due to GST, especially in rural India on the back of a normal monsoon forecast. However, there are four factors that have the potential to make or mar the companies’ performance going ahead. SMOOTH TRANSITION TO A GST REGIME The Goods and Services Tax (GST) is likely to ring in short-term disruption for the industry — the impact could be different for different companies. The June quarter performance will show the exact impact of the transition. HUL, for example, expects inventory pipeline correction of 100 to 250 bps in the current quarter ahead of the GST roll-out. “While there will be disruption for around a month as the channel gets replenished with new inventory, improved efficiency in terms of logistics should add around 2% to the operating margin of FMCG companies this year,” said Ulhas Kamath, joint managing director of Jyothy Laboratories. In the medium term, companies could benefit in product segments like tea and staple foods that have large unorganised players competing. “We are operationally ready for GST,” said Godrej Consumer Products in the company’s earnings call. “While there could be some temporary volatility in the channels around the GST implementation date as the trade adjusts to the new tax structure, we are confident that end-consumer demand will remain intact.” COMPETITION FROM PATANJALI Patanjali, the gatecrasher into the league of large FMCG companies, continues to be a threat for its older peers. Colgate Palmolive’s market share in toothpaste declined in the fiscal 2017. In the March quarter, HUL’s oral care business was subdued. Some companies have also relaunched products — to better take on Patanjali or to cash in on renewed consumer preference for natural products. HUL re-launched CloseUp toothpaste, Jyothy Laboratories did the same with Margo soap and Emami has proposed a re-launch of its Zandu brand of products. “I think some of the damage caused by Patanjali, particularly in honey, is now over and we are beginning to now regain some of the lost share,”said Sunil Duggal, CEO of Dabur, in the company’s latest earnings call. “I think market growth has absorbed a fair amount of Patanjali’s growth, a year ago Patanjali was really eating into shares of the existing players. I think the worst is behind us,” he added. VOLUMES Vs. MARGINS When volume growth shrank from double-digits, FMCG companies like HUL, Marico, GCPL, Dabur and Britannia focussed on margins. With forecast of normal monsoon, companies may be prompted to push rural demand while choosing to forgo some of the high level margins. How well the companies attain the volume-margin balance would determine their valuation on the Street. For instance, in the March quarter, FMCG bellwether HUL managed to strike the right balance — leading to the Street turning more bullish about the company’s prospects. VOLATILITY IN INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS Except GCPL, international business has not been a very strong growth driver for Dabur, Marico and Emami, which acquired companies outside India a few years ago. While GCPL has had success in its international business, its largest business in Indonesia is facing growth issues now. For FMCG companies, economic slowdown in emerging markets, sharp currency devaluations in some countries and political instability in others have hindered growth.

SportsFeaturedNews Off to jail for Lionel Messi? On May 25, 2017 13,956 23 Spain’s Supreme Court on Wednesday confirmed a 21-month jail sentence and 2.09-million-euro fine imposed on Lionel Messi for tax fraud, months after the Barcelona football star lodged an appeal. Messi The Argentina international and his father Jorge Horacio Messi were in July 2016 found guilty of using companies in Belize, Britain, Switzerland and Uruguay to avoid paying taxes on 4.16 million euros of Messi’s income earned from his image rights from 2007-09. The income related to Messi’s image rights that was hidden includes endorsement deals with Danone, Adidas, Pepsi-Cola, Procter & Gamble and the Kuwait Food Company. Both Messi and his father were given 21 months in jail – sentences likely to be suspended as is common in Spain for first offences for non-violent crimes carrying a sentence of less than two years. They appealed to the Supreme Court. While the court confirmed the sentence for Messi on Wednesday, it reduced it to 15 months jail for his father, taking into account that his football star son had paid back the defrauded money to tax authorities. During last year’s trial, Messi had argued that he trusted his father with his finances and “knew nothing” about how his wealth was managed. But the Supreme Court argued that he would have known about his obligation to pay taxes on income earned from his image rights. Messi’s tax fraud trial in June last year took place against a backdrop of simmering voter anger over steep cuts to health and social spending, as the government struggles to bring Spain’s public deficit down.

SportsFeaturedNews Off to jail for Lionel Messi? On May 25, 2017 13,957 23 Spain’s Supreme Court on Wednesday confirmed a 21-month jail sentence and 2.09-million-euro fine imposed on Lionel Messi for tax fraud, months after the Barcelona football star lodged an appeal. Messi The Argentina international and his father Jorge Horacio Messi were in July 2016 found guilty of using companies in Belize, Britain, Switzerland and Uruguay to avoid paying taxes on 4.16 million euros of Messi’s income earned from his image rights from 2007-09. The income related to Messi’s image rights that was hidden includes endorsement deals with Danone, Adidas, Pepsi-Cola, Procter & Gamble and the Kuwait Food Company. Both Messi and his father were given 21 months in jail – sentences likely to be suspended as is common in Spain for first offences for non-violent crimes carrying a sentence of less than two years. They appealed to the Supreme Court. While the court confirmed the sentence for Messi on Wednesday, it reduced it to 15 months jail for his father, taking into account that his football star son had paid back the defrauded money to tax authorities. During last year’s trial, Messi had argued that he trusted his father with his finances and “knew nothing” about how his wealth was managed. But the Supreme Court argued that he would have known about his obligation to pay taxes on income earned from his image rights. Messi’s tax fraud trial in June last year took place against a backdrop of simmering voter anger over steep cuts to health and social spending, as the government struggles to bring Spain’s public deficit down.

Tags: Coupons, Grocery coupons Posted 6:08 a.m. yesterday Leave this field blank Your e-mail address:* Your friends e-mail addresses (comma separated):* Subject:* Message:*A friend wanted you to see this item from WRAL.com: http://wr.al/18AEF Get a new codeAre you human?* You must enter the characters with black color that stand out from the other characters How many coupon inserts will we have in the Sunday paper on May 28, 2017? There should be 1 Proctor & Gamble insert this weekend. Usually on holiday weekends there aren't any coupons in the Sunday paper so it's nice to get at least one insert. You can see a preview each week by Friday of many of the coupons we will get at HotCouponWorld.com. We won't receive all the same coupons, but we will get many of the same ones. If you buy the paper at a store on Sunday (instead of getting a subscription delivered to your home), make sure you look inside the paper before you buy it so you can see that the coupons are in there. You will find that sometimes, the papers at the stores and in the paper boxes do not have coupons. Sometimes the newspaper runs out of coupon inserts and because the home delivery papers are the first to get the coupons, the papers that go to the stores do not always have all the coupons. And if you are looking for somewhere to donate your expired manufacturer coupons, our US troops overseas can use them at many on-base commissaries after they have expired. Find out where to send them at www.coupsfortroops.org. Happy shopping everyone!

The Argentina international and his father Jorge Horacio Messi were in July 2016 found guilty of using companies in Belize, Britain, Switzerland and Uruguay to avoid paying taxes on 4.16 million euros of Messi's income earned from his image rights from 2007-09. The income related to Messi's image rights that was hidden includes endorsement deals with Danone, Adidas, Pepsi-Cola, Procter and Gamble and the Kuwait Food Company. Both Messi, 29, and his father were given 21 months in jail -- prison terms likely to be suspended as is common in Spain for first offences for non-violent crimes carrying a sentence of less than two years. They appealed to the Supreme Court, which confirmed the sentence for the five-time world player of the year on Wednesday. However, it also reduced the term to 15 months jail for his father, taking into account that his football star son had paid back the defrauded money to tax authorities. The player and his father made a voluntary payment of 5.0 million euros -- equal to the amount of the alleged unpaid taxes plus interest -- in August 2013 after being formally investigated. - Barcelona problems - ====================== During last year's trial, Messi had argued that he trusted his father with his finances and "knew nothing" about how his wealth was managed. Prosecutors had asked for Messi to be absolved, arguing there was no evidence that the player was aware of how his income was managed. But the Supreme Court said Wednesday that he would have known about his obligation to pay taxes. "It defies logic to concede that someone who earns a large income does not know that he must pay taxes on it," the court wrote in its sentence. In its July sentence, the Barcelona court that initially found Messi guilty had argued that if the wealthy player was not punished, "ordinary" citizens could conclude that it was better to "not show interest" in their tax obligations. Messi's tax fraud trial had taken place against a backdrop of simmering voter anger over steep cuts to health and social spending, as the government struggles to bring Spain's public deficit down. Messi is far from the only Barca star to find himself embroiled in problems with the Spanish authorities. Brazil star and Barcelona forward Neymar and his parents are due to stand trial for alleged corruption over his transfer from Santos in 2013. Barca's Argentine defender Javier Mascherano also agreed a one-year suspended sentence with authorities for tax fraud last year. And former Barcelona president Sandro Rosell was arrested on Tuesday in a money laundering investigation related to the sale of the Brazilian national football team's television rights. Businessman Rosell, 53, had been manager of sporting goods giants Nike in Brazil before taking over as president of Barcelona in 2010.

The Argentina international and his father Jorge Horacio Messi were in July 2016 found guilty of using companies in Belize, Britain, Switzerland and Uruguay to avoid paying taxes on $4.67 million of Messi’s income earned from his image rights from 2007-09. The income related to Messi’s image rights that was hidden includes endorsement deals with Danone, Adidas, Pepsi-Cola, Procter & Gamble and the Kuwait Food Co. Lionel Messi (right) is followed by his father Jorge Horacio Messi as they arrive at a courthouse in Barcelona in June 2016. (AFP-Yonhap) Both Messi, 29, and his father were given 21 months in jail -- prison terms likely to be suspended as is common in Spain for first offences for non-violent crimes carrying a sentence of less than two years. They appealed to the Supreme Court, which confirmed the sentence for the five-time world player of the year Wednesday. However, it also reduced the term to 15 months jail for his father, taking into account that his football star son had paid back the defrauded money to tax authorities. The player and his father made a voluntary payment of $5.61 million -- equal to the amount of the alleged unpaid taxes plus interest -- in August 2013 after being formally investigated. During last year’s trial, Messi had argued that he trusted his father with his finances and “knew nothing” about how his wealth was managed. Prosecutors had asked for Messi to be absolved, arguing there was no evidence that the player was aware of how his income was managed. But the Supreme Court said Wednesday that he would have known about his obligation to pay taxes. “It defies logic to concede that someone who earns a large income does not know that he must pay taxes on it,” the court wrote in its sentence. In its July sentence, the Barcelona court that initially found Messi guilty had argued that if the wealthy player was not punished, “ordinary” citizens could conclude that it was better to “not show interest” in their tax obligations. Messi’s tax fraud trial had taken place against a backdrop of simmering voter anger over steep cuts to health and social spending, as the government struggles to bring Spain’s public deficit down. Messi is far from the only Barca star to find himself embroiled in problems with the Spanish authorities. Brazil star and Barcelona forward Neymar and his parents are due to stand trial for alleged corruption over his transfer from Santos in 2013. Barca’s Argentine defender Javier Mascherano also agreed a one-year suspended sentence with authorities for tax fraud last year. And former Barcelona President Sandro Rosell was arrested Tuesday in a money laundering investigation related to the sale of the Brazilian national soccer team’s television rights. Businessman Rosell, 53, had been manager of sporting goods giants Nike in Brazil before taking over as president of Barcelona in 2010. (AFP) 영어뉴스를 통한 ListeningㆍReading 실력 향상 단기 학습 프로그램 [NEST] 1.

Now Olay has trained a deep learning algorithm to study your face and help you make the best decision Get smart with your skin care When it comes to choice, more is not always better. The all too familiar conundrum of choosing between dozens of chocolate biscuits or hundreds of toothpastes can sometimes induce a kind of decision paralysis, a phenomenon that psychologists call the paradox of choice. Skin care conundrum It’s a problem often seen in the confused faces of customers surrounded by hundreds of products in the skin care section of department stores. A 2013 survey by consumer product giant Procter & Gamble found one third of women were unable to find what they were looking for in facial skin care aisles. Almost two-thirds say they have unused facial products at home. “There’s been an explosion of skin care brands and products in the past 10 years or so,” says Dr Frauke Neuser, principal scientist for P&G brand Olay. “One result is that women are shopping in places where they can get advice. However, that can be intimidating for those who might not want to buy a £150 skin cream recommended for them.” Advertisement P&G says it has the solution. Its web-based Olay Skin Advisor analyses make-up-free selfies uploaded by users to estimate skin age and make personalised product suggestions. It is believed to be the first artificial intelligence-based skin care advice tool. It’s the result of decades of endeavour. P&G scientists have been studying skin for over 60 years and developing improved image capture and analysis technology for almost three decades (see “A history in imaging“). That includes a 2015 clinical study comparing the facial skin of 330 women of different ethnicities. These included a subset judged to look at least 10 years younger than they actually are and who proved to have a common pattern of gene expression. Inspired by this study, P&G scientists wondered whether artificial intelligence could replace the subjective human judgements of age with something more objective. The idea of machines that can perceive the world, learn from examples and understand humans has been around since the 1950s. It is however only in recent years that major strides in building such machines have been made thanks to key advances. These include the rapid growth in large datasets that include images and the ability to store such vast amounts of data. Also important has been a shift to using computer chips known as graphics processing units (GPUs) originally developed for video gaming. These offer enhanced power over normal chips for certain tasks. “There’s a natural fit between the workloads of deep learning models and gaming. Both involve doing very large batches of computations, and doing so in parallel,” says Thomas Bradley, Director of Developer Technology at NVIDIA, which created the GPUs used to train and run the Olay Skin Advisor deep learning algorithm. That algorithm, the result of experimenting with image recognition software, is the outcome. It was developed by the P&G bioinformatics group with artificial neural networks, computer simulations inspired by the way human brains process information. They allow so-called deep learning by a machine. Deep learning models “Human brains learn to estimate people’s ages by building a model that associates features we see in faces with the ages we know those people are,” says Dr Jun Xu, a P&G computational biologist and lead developer of the Olay Skin Advisor’s VizID™ algorithm. “Deep learning mimics this process.” Deep learning models are made up of hierarchies of filters called “layers” designed to detect the presence or absence of features. Each pixel in an image has red, green and blue colour values. By analysing these, a layer can, for example, look for the edge of a feature or the edge of a colour patch. It then passes its finding on to the next layer, which might look at what shapes are formed by those edges. Early layers look at smaller areas and later ones assess larger ones. By going through 20 such layers, VizID™ builds skin age predictions. By comparing these repeatedly with known real ages, it can tweak the weightings it gives to different elements to improve its accuracy. Olay researchers used 50,000 selfies of women of different ages and ethnicities to “train” their model. This included feeding these images back through the algorithm 250 more times, each time with a slight change to lighting, resolution or positioning, for example. This ensures the model learns to predict the right age despite these image variations (a technique called data augmentation). “Deep learning mimics the way the human brain learns to estimate people’s ages” Once trained, the model was tested with a new set of 630 selfies of women aged 18-65. The Olay Skin Advisor’s average age difference was 3.8 years. This compared to an average of 7.3 years for a group of dermatologists. By retracing the model’s calculations, the Olay team found it assigned most weight to eye wrinkles, pigmented age spots and “laughter lines” running between the corners of the mouth and the edge of the nose. These are among key features that humans also use to estimate age. Launched last year, Olay Skin Advisor gives users an estimate of their skin age and tells them which of their forehead, cheeks, mouth, and eye areas are in best shape, as well as which could benefit most from improvement. Based on this and questionnaire answers, it gives personalised product recommendations. More than 1 million women have already used the web-based tool. The images they uploaded are helping further improve its accuracy. A survey of users carried out by P&G found 94 per cent agreed that the products recommended by the algorithm were right for them and 88 per cent were still using the same products four weeks later. “We’re not doing this because deep learning is cool,” says Neuser. “Ultimately the proof is in the pudding. If women buy the recommended products, see results, and keep using those products, then we can say that Olay Skin Advisor is a success.” A history in imaging THE use of deep learning in the Olay Skin Advisor may seem bold, but it is no leap in the dark. In fact P&G has been breaking new ground in skin imaging and analysis for 30 years. These advances were initially designed to assist product development, before later being used in devices that assess skin age by analysing features such as texture, tone and radiance in images. During the 1990s, for example, it developed software to correct colour variations caused by changes in lighting and camera response by comparing them with reference colours incorporated into images. It also standardised facial positioning using “ghost images” from earlier capture sessions to precisely line subjects up in later ones. In 2001, P&G licensed its imaging know how to Canfield Scientific as the basis for its in-store, feature-based skin analysis devices, and later to create VISIA, a similar system for medical professionals. In 2006, P&G automated the assessment of the molecular basis of skin colour using digital cameras and custom software to create maps of melanin and haemoglobin. “Adopting deep learning algorithms hasn’t been as difficult as it might have been, thanks to Olay’s rich heritage in image acquisition and analysis,” says Dr Paul Matts, Olay Research Fellow.

His other prediction: "The probability of Tesla surviving in the long term [is] actually pretty low as well." Such claims could be construed as coming from a technology disruption denier. Anything but. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link Magellan CEO Hamish Douglass is a disruption disciple. Photo: Jessica Hromas Douglass, who co-founded global share fund Magellan, is a disruption disciple, having moved away from a devotion to a range of international consumer companies that he now sees as dinosaurs. He is not alone. There are other investment managers, some of whom hitched themselves to the technology investment train years ago and have ridden the rise in the likes of Google, Facebook and Amazon. Advertisement Douglass grew Magellan by investing in leading global stocks - some of which he now considers are becoming victims of technology - the likes of Procter & Gamble and US retailer Target. But standing before a conference this week and declaring Uber is likely to be broke in 10 years, Douglass is marketing his firm's credentials as one that has evolved. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link Douglass claims Uber is "one of the stupidest businesses in history". Photo: AP The message he is actually trying to convey is two-fold. First, that investors shouldn't be swayed by big or familiar tech brands such as Uber and Tesla. Rather, look under the hood at the business model because some just don't stack up. All tech is not good tech. And just because they are big today doesn't mean they are safe investments. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link Amazon's Jeff Bezos believes we are five to 10 years away from computers being able to understand everything that's written in Wikipedia, not just translate it, Douglass says. Photo: Bloomberg Tesla, despite producing only a small number of cars, is worth more than Ford, and Uber is now valued at $US68 billion ($91.6 billion), having raised billions from investors in what Douglass likens to a Ponzi scheme. Tesla and Uber currently operate business models that are based on driving cars when Douglass sees driverless cars as the future of consumer transport. He believes Google is ahead in the race for autonomous vehicles. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link Tesla, despite producing only a small number of cars, is worth more than Ford. Photo: Tesla The other plank in his investment thesis is to beware of companies that are currently churning out big profits but will become victims of technological disruption down the track. Staying with this metaphor, he thinks that when driving your investment portfolio, you must be looking into the distance and not in the rear-view mirror. Say five or even 20 years down the track. We know that the companies that dominate the US market today - such as Amazon and Google - were relative minnows 10 years ago. The trick to investing in new-economy companies is predicting winners in the midst of a technology-based revolution in which the rate of change is exponential and disrupters can become disrupted. By way of example, Microsoft demonstrated last year it could translate the whole of Wikipedia from English to another language on its Azure platform in a 10th of a second. "We are entering a period in history over the next 10 to 20 years where there are going to be fundamental challenges and disruptions to many business models in the world," Douglass says. "And [while] people have been saying that is not delivering any productivity gains, I would argue strongly that's because we are sitting between two industrial periods in history." The previous revolutions was about industrialisation and globalisation and the one we are seeing today is the digital revolution, he says. The industrial revolution and later globalisation led to massive productivity gains, which have now been well and truly harvested. The new era of disruption will be just as momentous. We have already seen early signs in industries like media and music, but Douglass argues this is but a small taste of what is to come. "We would argue if we look 10 to 15 years out, we are going to have disruption of scale similar to what we saw in [the] industrial and globalisation revolutions." "If you go to human knowledge, it has never really been automated but we are within five to 10 years away from software programs written to truly automate human knowledge and what is missing is computer understanding of natural language." Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon's Jeff Bezos believe we are five to 10 years away from computers being able to understand everything that's written in Wikipedia, not just translate it, he says. It would be a massive breakthrough in artificial intelligence. "Once that happens, the big revolution will be able to attack service and knowledge-based industries at scale ... we can add manufacturing like 3D printing which could completely change the paradigm of manufacturing and where goods get manufactured in the world." So what about the Amazon effect? We are already seeing the value of retailers across the globe being re-rated down on the back of the impact of Amazon. Douglass says that even a company like Procter & Gamble, with one of the most formidable line-ups of consumer brands on the planet -Gillette, Pampers, Tide - which has historically traded at a long-term multiple of 20 times earnings, will be, in the the future, subject to mass disruption by Amazon. "They [P&G] have been so powerful because their business model has been supported by traditional advertising, which has largely been television," Douglass says. And the world's largest advertiser works in partnership with the big retailers like (US) Woolworths and Tesco. So what traditional companies are safe from the technology onslaught? Try Coca-Cola, McDonald's and even Starbucks and Nike, he says. People still eat, drink and exercise.

By P. Claire Dodson3 minute Read Every year, Beautycon’s New York event brings tens of thousands of thrilled makeup obsessives to see their beloved Youtube influencers up close and personal. Over the past four years, Beautycon has grown from a more typical conference to this year’s full-blown festival at Brooklyn Cruise Terminal, which had more than 75,000 square feet of panels, meet-ups, and art installations, and featured brands like Revlon, NYX, and L’Oreal Paris. advertisement The event was in many ways the perfect encapsulation of what Beautycon calls the “Pivotal Generation”–that mix of young millennials and older Gen Z-ers. “It’s a really sweet spot for a very hyper-engaged consumer,” says Moj Mahdara, Beautycon’s CEO.  Moj Mahdara Beautycon the company has been able to tap into that generation through a three-tiered approach that includes subscription makeup box à la Ipsy; the Beautycon festivals that occur in multiple U.S. cities each year; and Beautycon Digital, a platform for beauty-centric video and articles. All that content generates data, which Beautycon then uses in its brand partnerships through its consulting and analytics arm, aptly named FOMO. So far, Beautycon has worked with the likes of Revlon and Nike, as it provides solutions for expansion. “It really just came out of brands needing to take learnings from Beautycon and apply it to every other piece of their business,” Mahdara says. “At the end of the day, these larger legacy brands have to innovate and iterate. There’s only so many acquisitions they can make for $1 or $2 billion at a time. At some point they have to bring the best practices of companies like Lime Crime or Kylie Cosmetics or NYX and bring those learnings into Estée Lauder, L’Oreal, [or] P&G.” Related: How Beautycon Stars Are Leading Conversations About Diversity Take the festivals for example. Last week’s Beautycon event brought 9,000 people to a makeup wonderland where Instagram was the currency for free product samples. Budding social media influencers mingled with those more established, taking pictures in front of, say, L’Oreal’s rose-covered mini-Eiffel Tower. Ticket-buyers could receive makeovers from their favorite companies and then try their luck in a casting call for a brand like Milk Makeup. They could explore Drew Barrymore’s prestige makeup company Flower Beauty and then see Barrymore herself being interviewed in the booth next door. At Beautycon, the focus is all about access and experience. “Fans are driven by wanting to touch and feel. It’s not enough for them to just buy something,” Mahdara says. “They want to actually understand what the brand is from their messaging. They want to understand what they stand for. It’s about a two-way conversation.” advertisement For influencers like Jessie Paege, whose YouTube following reaches more than 1.1 million subscribers, Beautycon is a chance to meet the people who support her career. Jessie Paege, a YouTube influencer, hosted meetups at this year’s festival in partnership with BigSexyHair. [Photo: Tia Liu, courtesy of BeautyCon]“I went as a fan a few years ago, and it was the most exciting day of my life. I’m friends with a lot of the people I met, which is funny,” Paege says. She has since worked with brands like Lime Crime, BigSexyHair, and Clean & Clear. Another tenet of Beautycon is promoting diversity, confidence, and self-love, especially for women and LGBTQ people. The company is teaching big brands that having diverse representation in everything from foundation colors to advertising campaigns is crucial. It also furthers an idea that women have known all along: Makeup isn’t a tool for insecurity, it’s a tool for confidence. “Being involved in the beauty space, I’ve learned that there are sides to me that I was always scared to show people,” Paege says. “It’s cool to see those sides to yourself because you never let that show. I’ve also started pursuing new hobbies, things I’d always dreamed of doing. I’ve realized that I’m capable.” Beautycon CEO On Being An Iranian Woman In The Workplace About the author P.

The Chicago-area contest, which was part of a national in-classroom and web accessible STEM curriculum called NextGen Animal Responders launched in January, encouraged teachers and students to submit video entries to demonstrate their exemplary efforts in the appreciation of wildlife conservancy and answer simple questions about why preserving wildlife is important. As grand prize winners, the class from Memorial Junior High School received a special trip to Dawn’s wildlife partner Shedd Aquarium to learn more about animal care and conservation, including protecting and rehabilitating aquatic animals. “Shedd has been committed to working with response and rescue organizations globally for over 50 years and the urgency to protect animals and their environments is greater than ever,” said Bridget Coughlin, Shedd Aquarium president and CEO. “Dawn and Shedd both share a similar passion for wildlife conservation as well as a shared mission of educating and inspiring the world about the wellbeing of animals, habitat conservation, and the health of our oceans. We’re happy to see the students of Memorial Junior High School working together and we hope their curiosity and interest about the conservation and protection of wildlife continues throughout their lifetime.” Memorial Junior High’s winning video “Protect the Future of Wildlife” asks viewers to take small steps towards protecting wildlife such as cutting up plastic soda-rings before discarding, using reusable grocery bags and properly throwing away balloons so they don’t end up harming marine wildlife. During the field trip at Shedd, the winning students interacted with rescued animals and got an exclusive behind the scenes look at Shedd’s animal hospital, Microbiome Lab, Caribbean Reef exhibit and more.

These 5 ways have a proven track record that you can follow. By Bill Carmody Bill Carmody is the founder and CEO of Trepoint and a 22-year digital marketing veteran. His purpose in life is to be an inspirational leader who enjoys solving problems and creating breakthroughs for those brave enough to build a better future. @BillCarmody Founder and CEO, Trepoint@BillCarmody WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement Yes, Millennials are different than other generations, but they're really not that hard to understand. If there's something businesses should know, it's that in order for Millennials to be loyal to your brand, they have to really connect with your brand. Here are five proven methods your business can authentically connect with Millennails. 1. Make an emotional connection. When your brand can tap into a Millennial's emotions, your chances of developing a more valuable customer relationship increases exponentially. Use your products, services and in-store experience to help customers feel confident, improve their work or personal life and/or support a cause they believe in. It's also common knowledge that Millennials like healthier food options and are enticed by imagery. So in 2015, Whole Foods opened new stores called 365 by Whole Foods. The objective here was to make healthy living easy and budget-friendly for modern shoppers. In its first three stores, Whole Foods used bold visuals, authentic messaging and local details in their in-store environments to better connect emotionally with Millennial customers; and it worked as intended. The opening days for each store were very successful, and that early success continues to this day. There are five current 365 by Whole Foods locations with plans to open 12 more in 2017. 2. Let them tell their story. Great storytelling has always been in high demand, but in the last few years, storytelling has evolved into the latest marketing rage. Simply put, if you're not currently letting your Milllennial customers share their experiences with your brand, you're missing out. U.S. Millennials have about $1.3 trillion in yearly buying power, and 74 percent of consumers turn to social media to inform their buying decisions. Millennials have a voice and want to use it, and they're also interested in other people's stories. Let Millennialls generate and curate your content. Find Millennials influencers (see related story on influencer marketing) and brand ambassadors to create and share personal content with customers in varying forms for more effective marketing efforts. 3. Get technical. According to Gallup research, digital experience has the utmost effect on Millennials' engagement with a brand. Compared to other generations, they care the most about technology, and they're the most influenced by technology. If there's one industry that needs to start incorporating more tech, it's the travel industry. In a recent survey, 80 percent of Millennials took at least one leisure trip in 2016, while the average was 2.38 vacations per Millennial. And in 2015, the most desirable hotel amenity to Millennials was free internet access. Starwood Hotels and Resorts (see related story) wanted to keep up with this information and Millennial expectation, so a few years ago it launched two new services in some of its hotels: a robotic butler and smartphone-enabled room entry. By making hotel room entry and stay easier with technology and utilizing personal mobile devices, Starwood has opened new doors for its worldwide hotels and customers, and last summer, there were more than 350,000 members registered for its SPG Keyless. 4. Provide convenience (and go green when you can). Procter & Gamble knows that Millennials want products that offer convenience, so after much research and development, Tide Pods were launched in 2012. Instead of people buying large bottles of laundry detergent and using more than needed or not enough, now Millennials just have to throw in a small Tide Pod for the perfect wash. And it's not just the convenience Millennials like; Tide Pods are also energy-efficient, which is another reason why this generation quickly got behind this product. 5. Don't make assumptions. Ask and listen. You may think you know your ideal customers, but never make assumptions. If you want to know what someone likes or wants, you need to either ask them or leverage social media listening to better understand what they are actively seeking out amongst their peers. A good example of this is Mountain America Credit Union who decided to really listen to its Millennial customers and employees. Today, Millennials make up about half of MACU's net new member growth and 70 percent of its staff. And this credit union has been able to do that not just by surveys and focus groups like many companies rely on, but through advisory councils at local high schools. They meet with them monthly to discuss their banking pain points, to get their input on design and find out how financial institutions can better provide simple solutions to help Millennials have good financial futures. Instead of making assumptions, MACU regularly asks its employees and customers what they want, and then uses their feedback to make more strategic business and marketing decisions geared toward this generation. Get your slice of $1.3 trillion in annual buying power If you're looking to attract more Millennials customers into your business, incorporate these five proven methods to attract and retain this powerful generation of buyers. For more on this incredible generation, check out this inspiring story of Amanda Holmes, learn why Millennials don't trust advertising and better understand the sad truth about Millennials' retirement savings. There's lots to understand about the Millennial generation if you are to attract and retain them as your customers.

The prison term is likely to be suspended. The Argentina international and his father, Jorge Horacio Messi, were found guilty in July last year of using companies in Belize, Britain, Switzerland and Uruguay to avoid paying taxes on ß4.16-million (R60.3-million) Messi earned from his image rights from 2007-09. The income related to Messi’s image rights which was hidden includes endorsement deals with Danone, Adidas, Pepsi-Cola, Procter & Gamble and the Kuwait Food Company. Both Messi, 29, and his father were given 21 months in jail – prison terms likely to be suspended, as is common in Spain for first offences for non-violent crimes carrying a sentence of less than two years. They appealed to the Supreme Court, which confirmed the sentence for the five-time world player of the year yesterday. However, it reduced the term to 15 months in jail for Jorge, taking into account that his son had paid back the defrauded money to tax authorities. The player and his father made a voluntary payment of ß5-million (R72.4-million) – equal to the amount of the alleged unpaid taxes plus interest – in August 2013 after being formally investigated. During last year’s trial, Messi had argued that he trusted his father with his finances and knew nothing about how his wealth was managed. But the Supreme Court said yesterday: “It defies logic to concede that someone who earns a large income does not know that he must pay taxes on it.” Messi’s tax fraud trial had taken place against a backdrop of simmering voter anger over steep cuts to health and social spending, as the government struggles to bring Spain’s public deficit down. Messi is far from the only Barca star to find himself embroiled in problems with the Spanish authorities. Brazil star and Barcelona forward Neymar and his parents are due to stand trial for alleged corruption over his transfer from Santos in 2013. Barca’s Argentine defender, Javier Mascherano, agreed to a one-year suspended sentence for tax fraud last year. And former Barcelona president Sandro Rosell, 53, was arrested on Tuesday in a money-laundering investigation related to the sale of the Brazilian national football team’s television rights.

The original punishment, which included a prison sentence and a fine, will stand. Last July, a Spanish court found Messi and his father, Jorge Messi, guilty of tax fraud. Messi and his father were each sentenced to 21 months in prison. The length of the sentence was significant because, in Spain, those who receive a light prison sentence do not usually serve time unless the offense involves a violent crime or if the defendant is a habitual offender. Typically, a light sentence is one under two years which means that the pair would likely serve probation. Charges were initially filed against the Argentine footballer in 2013. Spanish tax authorities alleged at the time that Messi’s father used a series of shell companies in tax havens to shield royalties and licensing income from tax. Authorities had alleged that income from lucrative contracts with such companies as Pepsi-Cola, Procter & Gamble, and Adidas was funneled offshore to Belize and Uruguay through an elaborate maze of entities and countries so that Messi and his father could avoid paying income tax in Spain as far back as 2005. Messi consistently maintained throughout the proceedings that he did not do anything wrong. Nonetheless, shortly after the charges against him were made public, he took steps to clear the tax debt, making a "corrective payment" of €5 million ($6.57 million U.S.). Nonetheless, in 2015, Spanish tax authorities ordered the footballer to stand trial.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 25 May 2017 by wiseguyreports India Laundry Care Market 2017 Share, Trend, Segmentation and Forecast to 2021 This report gives an in-depth analysis of laundry care market in India which includes detergents and fabric care. Even during an economic slowdown, people continue to purchase laundry products, and in emerging economies like India, where standards of living are on the rise, the market is growing. The detergent market in India is in maturity stage with high penetration levels and fabric care is in a preliminary stage. Due to higher population, rising urbanization and increasing levels of income and consumption, the overall growth of the laundry care industry has been at a healthy rate from last five years. The one compliment which every Indian housewife craves is earning the respect and appreciation of the family by providing a solution that helps them enhance the life of delicate clothes. Due to such societal custom, fabric whiteners are already popular among Indian consumers. Request a sample report @ https://www.wiseguyreports.com/sample-request/744777-india-laundry-care-market-outlook-2021 According to “India Laundry Care Market Outlook, 2021”, the overall laundry care industry is growing with a CAGR of 12.93% from last five years. Detergents generate majority of the revenue sales in the laundry care market whereas fabric care is growing fast. Detergents are available in three forms namely powder detergent, bar detergent and liquid detergent. Powder detergents are widely accepted by Indian consumers. Even though detergent bars are still used in rural areas, they are fast disappearing from the market because of ineffectiveness. Liquid detergent is a new category in the Indian market and was created by Hindustan Unilever in 2013 with the launch of country’s first liquid detergent. Although powder detergents are most commonly used because of their stability, eco-feasibility and long lasting properties, liquid detergents will see robust growth in the forecast period. HUL, Rohit Surfactants, P&G, Nirma and Jyothy Laboratories are the major players in the organized detergent market. Ghari, Surf Excel, Active Wheel, Rin, Tide, Nirma, Ariel, Mr. White and Henko are the well-known brands operating in this category. On the basis of pricing, organized detergent market can be further divided into three categories such as popular (economy), mid-range and premium. On the other hand, fabric care is broadly divided into two segments namely fabric whiteners and fabric conditioners. Fabric whiteners generate majority of the market revenues whereas fabric conditioners have very less contribution. Various companies in the category include Jyothy Laboratories, Godrej, Wipro, HUL, Dabur, Marico and Reckitt Benckiser. In the forecast period, rural market will be the major focus of fabric whitening manufacturers as urban consumers are now upgrading to premium detergents which do not require any additional whitener. Fabric conditioners are already growing in double digits from last five years and the market is further anticipated to register robust CAGR in the forecast period. Detergent manufacturers, who are planning to diversify, are also focusing more on this category rather than fabric whiteners.

May 25, 2017 Filed under HEALTH Posted by FCEditor The answer’s unclear about the harm of proton pump inhibitors. BY SYDNEY LUPKIN AND PAULINE BARTOLONE KAISER HEALTH NEWS/TNS Sherry Herman was watching TV when the ad popped up on the screen. Lawyers were seeking clients for a class-action lawsuit, suggesting a link between certain heartburn pills and chronic kidney disease — including the beige capsules she’d taken for years. Sherry Herman, 50, of Dayton, Ohio, had been taking generic Prilosec for a decade when she was diagnosed with chronic kidney disease. In light of recent studies and lawsuits, she wonders whether the heartburn medication is to blame. (TY GREENLEES FOR KAISER HEALTH NEWS) “And I was like, ‘Oh my gosh, yeah — me!’” said Herman, a 50-year-old homemaker in Dayton, Ohio. She’d been on a drug known as a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) for acid reflux disease since 2004. Thinking it was a “very safe drug,” she had taken the prescription pills for a decade, even though the label recommended four to eight weeks. More serious problem Then, in 2014, she was diagnosed with chronic kidney disease. “It came as a huge shock because no one in my family has it,” she said. She had no risk factors for the condition, such as poorly controlled high blood pressure. A growing body of research suggests the blockbuster drug that helped her stomach may have left her — and a number of patients like her — with a potentially much more serious medical problem. Recent research has linked the proton pump inhibitors, or PPIs, to serious side effects, including chronic kidney disease, and recently filed lawsuits allege, among other things, that the manufacturers should have known of their potential harms. The risk of chronic kidney disease is as much as 50 percent higher in people who’ve taken the drug compared with those who’ve not — although no causative link has been proven and manufacturers insist they are safe. For short-term use The drugmakers strongly defend their products. AstraZeneca is “confident in the safety and efficacy of Nexium and Prilosec when used in accordance with the FDA approved label,” said spokeswoman Abby Bozarth, in an emailed statement. Proton pump inhibitors, such as Nexium and Prilosec, among other brands, are blockbusters in the U.S. With 15.3 million prescriptions written in 2013 alone, they are considered highly effective at relieving gastroesophageal acid reflux as well as preventing and treating ulcers. Widely advertised, they are frequently prescribed for even minor indigestion, with serial renewals leading to chronic use — even though they were approved as safe by the Food and Drug Administration only for short-term treatment. Millions take them Studies have shown that PPIs could be prescribed unnecessarily as much as two-thirds of the time. And it’s not uncommon for patients to take the heartburn pills for years, even though their labels recommend limiting treatment to a few weeks or a few months. The result has been sales worth many billions of dollars a year for pharmaceutical companies, according to commercial intelligence firm EvaluatePharma. Tens of millions of Americans take the drugs, whether in prescription or over-the-counter formulation. Given those numbers, critics say that even the suggestion of risk is a problem for a drug that is over-prescribed by doctors and used inappropriately by patients. “When patients complain of gastrointestinal distress, it’s easy to just prescribe a PPI,” said Steven Chen, a doctor of pharmacy and associate dean for clinical affairs at the University of Southern California School of Pharmacy. Once patients start taking the drug, it’s easy to “forget that they may not need to be on it that long.” Poor tracking What’s more, fueling debate and the emerging lawsuits is FDA’s patchwork system that experts say is poorly equipped to track adverse events — even when they involve drugs like the PPIs that have been used by many millions of American over three decades. With no universally mandatory system to track the use of drugs and their side effects over time, the U.S. instead relies on manufacturers, doctors and patients to convey suspicion of harm as part of a mostly voluntary system. Dr. Sammy Almashat, of the research group Public Citizen, said only a small fraction of side effects are reported to the FDA and the database is “underutilized” by researchers and regulators. “We do what we can in this country with what we’re given. It’s not much.” Years on pills PPIs, which came to market in 1990, were a godsend for many patients. When Paula Cox, 69, of Bainbridge Island, Wash., first tried Prilosec, it was like “heaven” because the medication prevented the “extremely intense” heartburn symptoms that had plagued her since the 1980s. She’s been on the pills for more than 14 years, and although she hasn’t suffered any of the major health problems linked to them by research, she’d like to stop her daily regimen, especially in light of news about possible side effects. But Prilosec is “the only thing that’s working,” Cox said. PPIs work by blocking an enzyme in the cells that line the stomach, preventing them from secreting acid. They are the leading proven therapy for upper-gastrointestinal disorders, available by prescription and, in lower doses, over the counter. Studies raise concerns Chronic kidney disease damages the organs over time, rendering the body unable to eliminate wastes from the blood and excrete them through urine. The disease can be life-threatening, and patients may need dialysis or a kidney transplant to survive. Two huge studies, including data from hundreds of thousands of patients taking prescription PPIs, raised concerns about a link between the pills and kidney failure in 2016. (Over-the-counter medications were not studied because of the difficulty of collecting data.) Both studies, one published in JAMA Internal Medicine and the other in the Journal of the American Society of Nephrology, found that those taking prescription PPIs were more likely to develop kidney disease than patients taking another class of drugs known as H2 blockers, which treat similar digestive symptoms. Thousands of cases The research showed that patients taking the PPIs twice a day were more likely to develop the disease, and that the kidney risk associated with the pills increased over time for the first two years. Each study had the same limitation: It was “observational,” meaning it was not a gold-standard clinical trial that could prove cause and effect. Based on a collection of health records, the research could identify only association — i.e., whether patients taking PPIs were more likely to develop chronic kidney disease than patients who weren’t on the drugs. Attorney Paul Pennock said his New York-based firm, Weitz & Luxenberg, is investigating roughly 3,500 cases involving kidney harm allegedly from heartburn drugs, although he acknowledges not all will merit a lawsuit. Nationwide, Pennock said, about 122 suits have been filed, against AstraZeneca and other PPI makers such as Takeda Pharmaceuticals, Pfizer and Procter & Gamble, which produces over-the-counter Prilosec. Allyanna Anglim of Pfizer media relations says legal actions against the company are “without merit” and its PPI labels “have always provided accurate information on their benefits and risks.” Why, after all these years, aren’t the risks better known? Reports trickle in FDA spokeswoman Andrea Fischer said data linking chronic kidney disease and PPIs “are limited” but that the agency continues to monitor the potential risks. Both medical researchers and the Government Accountability Office have concluded that its methods for doing so are inadequate. Reports to the FDA mentioning PPIs in relation to a range of kidney problems trickled in and reached a few dozen per year by the late 1990s, according to a Kaiser Health News analysis of the federal Adverse Event Reporting System. The number of kidney-related reports naming PPIs as a primary suspect slowly crept up over the years and then doubled to more than 400 in 2016, the year the two prominent studies were published.
