Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on: Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink: Purchase: Order Reprint Target saw the writing on the fogged-up bathroom mirror. Its sales of men’s razors and blades, one of the biggest categories in its beauty and personal care aisles, had begun to slip as a number of upstart online brands were disrupting the industry and going straight to consumers, bypassing stores altogether. Its solution? The Minneapolis-based retailer joined forces with them. In the past year, Target has partnered with two subscription-based online brands — Harry’s and Bevel — brokering exclusive deals to be the only mass retailer to carry their products. “It’s been really working so far — knock on wood,” said John Butcher, Target’s senior vice president of beauty merchandising. Target’s market share in men’s shaving has jumped by double digits, as has its overall sales of men’s razors, he said. About 50 percent of Target’s razor handle sales and about 15 percent of its cartridges now come from Harry’s. And unlike what some expected, it hasn’t necessarily come at the expense of the longtime king of the razor aisle — Procter & Gamble’s Gillette. Gillette’s sales at Target have also been up, despite losing a bit of shelf space as Target cleaned up the product presentation, Butcher said. “There were some skeptics out there,” he said. “But the hypothesis was if we become a more meaningful destination for men’s shave, then we get more people in the aisle. And that affords everybody in the aisle the opportunity to win more business at Target. That’s exactly what’s happening.” Butcher said the alliance with Harry’s and Bevel is one of many ways Target is looking to beef up its offerings for men, who are increasingly shopping for themselves. “Guys have been underserved,” he said. “We feel like he’s looking for newness and he’s looking for solutions to his modern-day problems.” While it already sells a ton of men’s underwear, Target also sees some white space when it comes to clothing. So later this year, Target will launch a new in-house men’s apparel brand. A key ingredient to the partnership with Harry’s has been the eye-popping endcap displays that have been turning the heads of shoppers in a part of the store they were used to just breezing by without much inspiration. “The test at Target was ‘can we fundamentally alter the retail experience for buying shaving and grooming products and stop people in their tracks for the first time in a long time,’ ” said Jeff Raider, co-CEO of Harry’s. “It’s hard to do that in a small way. You’ve got to go big.” When it first launched in Target’s 1,800 stores last August, Harry’s displays included larger-than-life 4-foot-tall razors. Earlier this year, those were swapped out for a cutout of a guy in boxer shorts and tube socks standing in front of a mirror with a dog at his feet. It’s been so popular that some customers have tried walking out of the store with it. Amid the rapid innovation happening in the category, the $2.6 billion men’s shaving industry has been picking up steam over the past several years and grew about 4.4 percent last year, according to Euromonitor. While the pie has gotten bigger, Gillette has been losing ground. Its marketshare has dropped from 64 percent in 2013 to 54 percent in 2016. Dollar Shave Club, another direct-to-consumer company that sells online subscriptions and was sold to Unilever for $1 billion last year, now has about 8 percent of the market and has surpassed Bic, according to Euromonitor. Meanwhile, Harry’s, the No. 5 brand, more than doubled its share last year to 4 percent. The disruption in Target’s shaving aisle highlights the retailer’s increased willingness to make room on its shelves for up-and-coming specialty brands in order to stay relevant, putting the big national brands on notice that they might lose some shelf space, said Carol Spieckerman, a retail consultant. “Up to this point, there were certain categories that have been sacred spaces for national brands,” said Spieckerman. “You could see this [in men’s shaving] as the first of many more encroachments.” There’s not much the big brands can do about it. “A national brand can’t afford to turn down Target’s business,” Spieckerman said. “They just have to get over it.” It’s also pushed some companies to accelerate their innovation efforts. Gillette launched its own direct-to-consumer subscription service a couple of years ago and has recently cut prices. “There has always been competition in this category, and we are taking that seriously — in store or with new competitors online,” Gillette spokeswoman Barbara Diecker said in an e-mail. “We continue to focus our efforts on growing in both the traditional and e-commerce spaces.” While low-priced Harry’s and Dollar Shave Club were created in part because they felt the big brands were overcharging men for razors and blades, Bevel was aimed at addressing the frustrations of men of color who often struggle with razor bumps. Its single-blade system is a much higher-priced, premium product with razors starting at $50. Target started carrying Bevel in February 2016. This year, it has expanded its presence from 125 to 450 stores. Bevel now also sells its products through Amazon. “We care about retail in a big way,” Bevel founder Tristan Walker said last month at an industry event in Las Vegas. “The thing that people really don’t understand is retail is an incredibly profitable business. It’s an incredibly predictable business.” And it’s a rapidly growing part of his business. Retail sales through Target and Amazon made up 10 percent of Bevel’s overall sales last year, but is expected to account for about half of total sales this year, he said. While its online business was also growing fast, Harry’s executives said customers told them they wanted to be able to pick up replacement blades in a store if they ran out before their next subscription delivery was scheduled to arrive. Target made sense as a retail partner not only because of a shared design and value philosophy, but because about 75 percent of their customers were already Target shoppers. The Target partnership has also helped Harry’s reach new customers and those who aren’t necessarily interested in subscribing, preferring to try it out first or to buy it when already in the store, Raider said. He added that while selling at Target hasn’t driven a surge of new online subscriptions to Harry.com, it has helped drive business to Target’s own small, but growing subscription service. Harry’s is the top-selling brand for the service. In fact, Harry’s team has been giving advice and pointers to Target to help improve its subscription business. Raider said he’s not worried about losing out on direct sales as a result. “It’s got to be right for customers,” he said. “At the end of the day, we put our customers first, our business second. And what that tends to do is drive business.” After its exclusive agreement with Target expires, Raider said he’s not sure if the brand will expand to other mass retailers. “For now we’re just focused on trying to make the Target relationship feel really special and learn from it,” he said. “Over time, we’ll be free to do what we want. But that doesn’t necessarily mean that we will. … We don’t see our brand everywhere all at once.” Harry’s declined to disclose what percentage of its sales now come through Target, but Raider said a “significant majority” of Harry’s business is still through direct sales online.  kavita.kumar@startribune.com kavitakumar View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive, mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

If EM and SK are going to take over they say their first move will be to appoint a CEO to run things. Just wondering if that Man for that role could be the bloke holding the trophy Liverpool's former CEO Ian Ayre. Now i think he would make a excellent choice for us. But what ever happens if EM and SK do come the club will have people running the Club who no what they are doing and have a knowledge how to run a football club. As long as they let MW and Co do their jobs. Lets cross that bridge when we come to it until the contracts are signed sealed and delivered we have been here many times with Fawaz in the past. Reading in the press this deal is close that deal is close only for the ball to go flying over the bar or for Fawaz to move the goal post. Fawaz you have brought the club you said you support with a passion to the Abyss of League 1 or the third tier of English football what ever you want to call it. If at the start of your reign if you had took notice from Football People who had experience in running a football club you would not now be facing a loss and more importantly as supporters we would not be staring Division three in the face once again. New owners come New owners go as do managers and players no one person is bigger than the club. Brian Clough will always be remembered as will as will Peter Taylor as Legends.

He will probably find some interesting new partners to bring in much needed additional revenue to the club.

Here’s a look at how some of the newer brands came to be, and how they’re pushing older brands to keep up.  3 NEW BRANDS: +5  Kodiak Cakes The just-add-water, whole-grain pancake mix might have been ahead of its time when it was launched in 1995 by a Utah man based on an old family recipe. It was 10 years before the product was picked up by a national supermarket, while it gained steam at smaller stores. Big breaks came in 2014, with an appearance on the “Shark Tank” TV show and a new higher-protein blend picked up by Costco. Today, Kodiak Cakes sells more than $30 million in pancake mix a year and is the top pancake brand sold at Target. +5  Chobani The Greek yogurt brand embodies the fast-paced startup culture that big-food CEOs hope to emulate. Launched 10 years ago by a Turkish immigrant cheesemaker who bought an old Kraft plant, Chobani’s Greek-style yogurt blew up the category, reaching $1.5 billion in annual sales and overtaking big players like Yoplait. Its fast growth caused some stumbles along the way, though, including a 2014 recall. Still privately held, Chobani this spring hired an experienced executive from Nestlé to serve as president. +5  Screamin’ Sicilian This toppings-heavy, thick-crust frozen pizza comes with a free cardboard mustache. Family-owned Milwaukee pizza maker Palermo’s launched this premium-priced brand, which did $73.2 million in sales in its first year, ending 2016 one of the year’s “new product pacesetters” named by market research firm IRI. The company calls Screamin’ Sicilian the craft beer of pizzas. Mostly a private-label pizza maker, Palermo’s is now launching another trendy new brand, thin-crust Urban Pie Pizza Co. 3 OLD BRANDS: Kraft Macaroni & Cheese Kraft wanted to overhaul its classic Macaroni & Cheese dinner to eliminate artificial flavors, preservatives and dyes — but it didn’t want to spook customers. So it rolled out the new product but didn’t promote it for several months, long enough for people to try it and conclude that they #didntnotice — as the Twitter campaign went. The effort is bringing back lapsed consumers and getting more households to buy the product as Kraft fights off market share incursion from organic brand Annie’s, acquired in 2014 by General Mills. +5  MolsonCoors Just like big food companies, big brewers are struggling with a millennial shift, toward craft beer and cocktails. MolsonCoors has hit a few pitfalls as it looks to grow its old brands: The brewer yanked a Miller High Life campaign featuring hip millennials, and replaced it in 2016 with one it says celebrates the 1903 brand’s authentic heritage by reviving an old jingle: “If you’ve got the time, we’ve got the beer.” +5  Old Spice It’s not a food, but it’s a good example of how to revive your grandpa’s brand: Procter & Gamble saw a big sales and market share boost in old-fashioned Old Spice, which dates to 1937, after its 2010 “Smell Like a Man, Man,” campaign, geared to millennials with viral ads and social media content featuring former NFL player Isaiah Mustafa as “the man your man could smell like.” Sources: company statements; PR Week; Adweek; Dairy Reporter; Fast Company; Food Business News; Bloomberg; Chicago Tribune; Milwaukee Journal Sentinel; Wall Street Journal More information Healthy Choice for millennials? Conagra hopes to rework old brands to lure in new consumers Packaged food companies now are in a double bind: Launching big-time brands in a market crowded with niche products is a steeper climb, while many established brands — including Healthy Choice — are watching sales erode. Partly to blame are millennial shoppers, many of whom reject their parents’ old name-brand staples as they spread their food dollars around at specialty stores and online.

It's had 9 million views on YouTube so far. And it's launched a discussion on social media about the rights of transgender people. The 3 1/2-minute commercial, released online on March 31, doesn't mention any products. Instead, it tells what is labeled as a "true story." A girl in her teens, looking out a bus window, says she's on her way to boarding school because her mother wants her to be a doctor. Then the girl, Gayatri, tells how "mom" was kicked out of her own home when she was 18. And she took in little Gayatri after her birth mother was taken away in an ambulance and never came back. A powerful message by #Vicks https://t.co/87lr6ER95c that makes you think about #motherhood in a different way #touchofcare #storytelling pic.twitter.com/UBlvKBWAOq— meabhi (@meabhi) April 11, 2017 Earlier in the ad, we see the mother only from the back. She's wearing a sari. Then we see her face, with a red bindi on her forehead. Gayatri looks over and says, "This is my mummy. Isn't she lovely?" The ad does not mention that "mummy" is Gauri Sawant, who was born a boy and came out as a woman in her teens. But that's the point of the final scene: "In our civics text books, we read that everyone is entitled to the same basic rights," Gayatri says. "Then why is my mom denied them? This is why I'm not going to be a doctor, but a lawyer. For my mom." Then the logo of Vicks appears with the words: "Generations of Care." The story is indeed true, and the the real Gayatri and Gauri Sawant appear in the ad. But certain details are omitted from their story. The child was 6 when her mother, a sex worker, died of AIDS. Gauri, then 27, was her mother's friend and stepped in to raise her. When #PEPSI and #Nivea get it so wrong it's nice to see this #vicksindia advert captures rather more heart and soul. #EqualRights #diversity https://t.co/9O3Hb6ZlA5— Alexandra Notay (@aknotay) April 7, 2017 Some people think the ad exploits transgender people to sell a product. But on social media, where everyone is always ready to express outrage, the response has been resoundingly positive. On Facebook, where the video has racked up 2 million views and thousands of comments, most are a variation on, "This made me cry." Neeraj Ghaywan, the director of the ad, wrote on YouTube: "Thank you everyone! Just a note: It is actually Gauri Sawant (and not an actor) playing her part. Of course, legally she cannot adopt a child. Just hoping someday the world will be as one. Again, thank you for this overwhelming love from all around." That #vicksindia ad is so powerful & touching without being over the top preachy. Absolutely beautiful— Haseena Golimaar (@Erum_Sangji) April 3, 2017 "Motherhood has no gender" is a comment that's been repeated across all social media. The ad has also raised a debate about adoption and other rights for transgender people in India. Gauri Sawant is an activist for transgender people and runs an NGO in Mumbai. She was one of the original petitioners to challenge the government of India for equal rights and recognition for transgender people, resulting in the passage of a law by the Supreme Court of India. Everyone deserves to be be accepted. Let's be human first and then anything else. More power to you #GayatriSawant #TouchOfCare #Vicks https://t.co/rqUJaW1VW4— Tanu Chaubey (@tanuchaubey) April 6, 2017 As of April 15, 2014, application forms for college or documentation have had male, female and third gender as category options. And "third gender" people have been added to the quota for "Other Backward Classes" who are eligible for affirmative action, giving them a chance to apply for jobs in the government or to educational institutions that might not previously have considered them. Other provisions of the law, such as campaigns to diminish social stigma, have not yet materialized. When it comes to adopting a child, the law in India is still murky. While it is clear that same sex couples cannot adopt children, it's unclear if a transgender person, applying as a male or female, could. The Vicks ad raises questions about what rights "mummy" does indeed have to raise the little girl. Beyond Bathrooms: The Battle Over Transgender Rights Feb. 27, 2017 Teen Transgender Wrestler — A Reluctant Symbol Of A Nation Divided Feb. 26, 2017 In an email, Nitin Darbari, marketing director for Asia at Procter & Gamble, said the goal of the ad was to start a conversation and "celebrate" the changing definitions of family. "We are overwhelmed by the reactions and the willingness to engage in the conversations and the number of people who have evinced interest/stepped forward," Darbari wrote. For Harrish Iyer, an equal rights activist in Mumbai, the best thing about the ad is that it, "does something even our mainstream media hasn't managed: This ad normalizes [people who are transgender]. So many times if there's a gay or trans person portrayed, they're a caricature or a cause." Chhavi Sachdev is a journalist based in Mumbai.
