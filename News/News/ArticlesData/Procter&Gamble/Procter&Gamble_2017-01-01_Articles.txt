In 2013, she had a rough start in her senior level where she faltered far too many times at the U.S. Secret Classic which determines who will move on to the P&G Championships formerly known as simply the Nationals. She fell on her head on floor exercise, touched the beam along with many major mistakes throughout the routine and fell off uneven bars on a very common release move called the Tkatchev. After the disastrous meet and receiving close attention from coordinator Martha Karolyi, she would go on to win virtually everything in sight and led the 2016 U.S. Women's Gymnastics team to a third team gold medal, second consecutive, with astronomical numbers. Simone Biles went into 2016 as the female gymnast to beat. Over the previous three years, she won three consecutive World Championship titles along with many individual events. In all, Biles had won 14 World Championship medals, ten of them gold. That made her the most decorated World's female gymnast and put her in the position to sweep events held in 2016. In June, Biles began her trek to being one step closer to the 2016 Olympic Games. During the P&G Championships, she went into day 2 of competition with a 2.45 lead over the next competitor. By the end of the meet, she made U.S. history becoming the only female gymnast to have won four consecutive national titles. Joan Moore Gnat achieved a similar feat between 1971 and 1974 but two of those were shared titles. She left the competition as the winner with a 62.900, 3.9 points ahead of second place winner Aly Raisman. The one-two positions would carry on into the Games. Next up was the Olympic Trials. Since Martha Karolyi had taken over the U.S. program, the rules changed as to how gymnasts are selected to go to the worldwide stage. No longer has it been a combination of nationals and trials scores, but athletes were strategically chosen by the selection committee to fill the few spots on each event for team competition--who would be the strongest on each event. Though she took a fall on balance beam, a full point deduction, she secured the only guaranteed spot on the team earning 123.25 over two days of competition. First year senior Laurie Hernandez made her statement coming in second with 121.15. The committee took their time lasting roughly 30 minutes choosing Biles, Aly Raisman, Madison Kocian, Gabby Douglas and Laurie Hernandez. Finally, the Rio Games had arrived. Biles was of course the one to beat. During the qualifications round, Team USA left the competition with 185.238 points having a 10 point lead over the People's Republic of China. Qualifications determines the rest of the competition in all events. Biles and Aly Raisman would move on to the All-Around, Raisman having missed out on a medal in 2012. Biles would also move on to vault, balance beam and floor exercise, the latter being her most explosive with a move named after her (a double layout with a half twist out). During team finals, Biles' routines with high difficulty and start values helped the team win its third gold medal. The U.S. women scored 184.897 and had an 8.209 lead over the Russians. They dubbed themselves "The Final Five" and will go down in gymnastics history as the best female team. It was then the All-Around finals where Biles was more than expected to win. She and teammate Aly Raisman fought hard and Raisman accepted that if she came in second it would be like winning gold because Biles is in a league of her own. Routine after routine, when floor exercise came it was all but certain Biles and Raisman would take a one-two position. Raisman's FX is perhaps one of the most difficult in the world and she nailed pass after pass, crying coming off the floor knowing she would medal this Olympiad. It came down to Biles, the final performance of the night on FX where she smiled knowing she had it in the bag. At the end, her 15.933 score secured her victory and a rare moment of Biles in tears lit up the heart's of gymnastics lovers around the world. She finished with 62.198 while Raisman scored 60.098. Ending with individual events, Biles took home gold on vault while making a mistake that cost her the gold on balance beam. Biles touched the beam on a punch front and she finished with a bronze medal. Moving to her best event, Biles and Raisman took another one-two on floor exercise. By the end of the Olympic Games, Biles took home four gold and one bronze. Following the Olympic Games, Simone Biles had many appearances before going on the Kellogg's Tour, an exhibition after each Olympiad. She appeared in Jake Miller's music video as her love interest and released the book "Courage to Soar: A Body in Motion, A Life in Balance" with the forward by 1984 champ Mary Lou Retton. On December 26, Biles was named the AP Female Athlete of the Year becoming only the fifth gymnast to receive the honor. Voted by U.S. editors and news directors, Biles took the year-end honor with swimmer Katie Ledecky and tennis great Serena Williams following.

LUIS SANTANA | Times Happy New Year, Tampa Bay — you're worth more than you used to be. Related News/Archive Here are Tampa Bay's 25 priciest homes of 2016 1 Week Ago Which Tampa Bay neighborhood home values will rise most this year? The answer may surprise you. 3 Weeks Ago Tampa Bay foreclosure filings in 2016 fell to lowest in a decade 1 Week Ago In the year just ended, the total value of the bay area's housing stock soared 10.3 percent, nearly twice as much than the nation as a whole, according to a new report from Zillow. Dollar-wise, bay-area homes collectively exceed the market value of such giants as Bank of America, Procter & Gamble, Disney and Coca-Cola. If they all sold tomorrow, they'd bring in more money than the annual revenues of every Fortune 500 company except Walmart. On the downside, Tampa Bay housing values still haven't returned to pre-crash levels. And in another sign of the lingering effects of the foreclosure crisis, the large number of bay area residents who lease rather than own is spurring a hefty increase in rental rates. Zillow based its home value and rent report on an analysis of 536 U.S. metro areas. Overall, 2016 was a very good year for home ownership as the value of the nation's housing stock rose 5.3 percent to a record $29.6 trillion. That's more than the gross domestic product of the United States and China combined. "Housing is incredibly important to us personally and to the economy as a whole,'' said Svenja Gudell, Zillow's chief economist. "The U.S. housing stock is worth more than ever, which is a sign of the ongoing housing recovery. As buying a home gets more expensive, affordability remains a concern for many, and these numbers highlight just how much people are spending on housing.'' Related: How long can the good times roll for Tampa Bay's housing market for the bubble pops? Florida Realtors reported last month that the median price of single-family homes in the four-county Tampa Bay area soared nearly 15 percent in November to $204,900. For the area's two largest counties, Hillsborough and Pinellas, the figures were right around the $220,000 statewide median. Of the nation's total housing value, Los Angeles and New York account for the largest shares, at 8.6 percent and 8 percent, respectively, Zillow says. The next most valuable metro area is San Francisco, worth 4.2 percent of overall housing value. At the bottom end of the scale, the Raymondville metro area of south Texas was worth just slightly more than the $325 million contract awarded to Miami Marlins outfielder Giancarlo Stanton, to date the largest individual contract in sports history. While several U.S. markets are now more valuable than they were at the height of the housing bubble, about 60 percent including Tampa Bay are still below their peaks, Zillow found. Chicago, for example, remains about $134 billion shy of its all-time high. Zillow didn't give pre-crash figures for the Tampa Bay area. Its housing stock currently is worth more than that in Charlotte, San Antonio, Orlando and Austin but only about a third of that in the Miami-Fort Lauderdale area. Meanwhile, Tampa Bay renters spent far more than renters in several other major metro areas. Total bay area rents rose to $5 billion last year, an 11 percent increase compared to less than 4 percent nationally. While 2017 is forecast as the year when more millennials and first-time buyers enter Florida's housing market, the high rents they now pay can make it hard to come up with down payments and closing costs. One new apartment complex in downtown St. Petersburg charges as much as $2,885 for a one-bedroom unit.

New Year's Levee 2017 Stephen Petrick Bay of Quinte MP Neil Ellis dances with Belleville city councillor Jackie Denyes at the New Year’s levee. next play/pause pre Belleville News By Stephen Petrick Belleville – The year 2016 was a busy one for Belleville, but 2017 could be even more interesting. Because many city projects came into fruition over the past 12 months – such as the deal to land the Belleville Senators and the deal to land Shorelines Casino Belleville – there will likely be quite few ribbon-cutting events over the next 12 months to mark the official completion of those projects. “Fasten your seat belts, 2017 is going to be a very busy year,” said Mayor Taso Christopher at the city’s New Year levee on Sunday, Jan. 1. Hundreds of city supporters packed the gym at the Quinte Sports & Wellness Centre, to hear Christopher’s speech. The levee has become a Belleville tradition, as it allows the mayor and city councillors to bring New Year’s greeting to city residents. It also allows the mayor to deliver a speech highlighting city accomplishments from the previous year and what to expect in the new year. Christopher started by pointing out that 2016 was a record year for Belleville in terms of construction, as the city granted permits to projects worth a total value of more than $100 million, between the residential, commercial and industrial sectors. Meanwhile, a long list of capital projects were completed or got underway, including renovations to Sidney Street, Coleman Street and the Corby Rose Garden. The Bay Bridge/Dundas Street West project is 95 per cent complete, Christopher said and other important infrastructure projects moved forward, including the installation of new lighting at Jane Forrester Park; work the mayor called “breathtaking.” He also reminded residents of many newsworthy events that took place 2016; the city’s hosting of the World Under-19 Women’s Floorball Championships, the visit from delegates in Belleville’s South Korean sister city of Gunpo and, of course, the agreement to bring the Senators to the city. Renovations to the Yardmen Arena, to make room for the Senators for the start of the 2017-18 American Hockey League season are underway. “This is an exceptionally exciting time as we welcome professional hockey to Belleville,” said Christopher, setting off a heartfelt applause from the audience. He thanked the team of city officials, led by recreation director Mark Fluhrer, for the work they put in to make the deal happen. He also thanked Ottawa Senators owner Eugene Melnyk for investing in Belleville. “It was a pleasure working with him and I have a big note here. It says ‘Go Sens Go.’” He noted that the Senators, along with the new casino, currently under construction on Bell Boulevard, are primed to make Belleville a great tourist destination. He also hinted that the casino will open earlier than expected. “My spidey senses tell me it’s nine days away, ten days away.” he said. Those developments, however, are just a few examples of private business growth in Belleville. Christopher also spoke about the recent expansion of east-end business Triangle Fluid and how Procter & Gamble is planning a 160,000-square foot expansion of its College Street East facility. These developments, and others, are contributing to a healthy economy, Christopher said. He said the latest federal government statistics on the unemployment rate for Belleville’s region show a rate of 4.9 per cent. “That is a record,” he said. The warm speech was preceded by nearly an hour of cheery small talk outside the gymnasium. Citizens walked in and greeted Christopher and council members who formed a wedding-like reception line. At 12:20 p.m., the Air Force Pipe and City Pipe and Drum band, led the group into the gymnasium, to the sound of bagpipes. Towards the end of the speech, a video was played to commemorate Belleville’s 200th anniversary, which will be celebrated throughout 2017. The video is called My Belleville 200 and it quotes several residents talking about what they love about the city. The video served as a reminder that 2017 will be a festive year for the city, as Canada will also be celebrating its 150th birthday. “2017 is going to be another big year for the City of Belleville,” Christopher said.

Skip to content » « Covestor.com Learn More » Search The latest investment news from Covestor by Covestor Menu ProcessHow we’re investing now Profilesof smart investors OutlookMarket opportunities Strategiesand how they’re applied 2017: Where to invest January 2, 2017 by Charles Sizemore The year 2016 was, for lack of better description, a strange one. It started with one of the worst Januarys in history for stocks and an oil price bust. Then came a run of populist election surprises in Europe and the United States, and wrapped up with the Trump Rally. So after a year like that, what will 2017 bring? Here are some investing ideas that may help shape your thinking.     REITS I really believe real estate investment trusts (REITs) are the single most attractive American asset class right now. REITs have gotten utterly obliterated by the recent surge in bond yields. As a sector, they are down about 14% from their summer highs, and many of the more “bond-like” conservative REITs are down by closer to 30% as of December 19. That’s ugly. REITs are sensitive to bond yields for two reasons. First, they borrow a lot of money to buy their properties, so higher market interest rates cut directly into profits. Secondly, as income-focused investments, they are priced relative to bonds. So as bond yields rise (and bond prices fall), REIT yields rise (and prices fall). Inflation Hedge Remember: REITs, unlike bonds, actually enjoy a rising payout over time. REITs tend to raise their dividend by at least a couple percent per year, more than keeping pace with inflation. And should the inflation that everyone seems to fear from a Trump presidency come to fruition, real estate should perform at least moderately well, in my opinion, as real estate is a natural inflation hedge. That makes the Vanguard REIT ETF (VNQ) — which holds REITs such as Simon Property Group Inc (SPG) and Public Storage (PSA) — a natural play here in my opinion.   ENERGY The past two years have been rough for investors in energy stocks. If low oil and gas prices weren’t bad enough, there has also been constant political opposition to domestic infrastructure projects, such as the Keystone Pipeline and the Dakota Access Pipeline, both of which became cause célèbres for environmental activists. Well, it remains to be seen what direction oil and gas prices go from here. The OPEC meeting late last year seemed to show that the major crude exporters are serious about keeping prices stable.   Pipeline Politics But virtually every member of the cartel is also known to cheat on their quotas, so we’ll see how this agreement sticks. But regardless of what direction oil and gas prices go, I think it is all but certain that energy infrastructure does well. President-Elect Trump has already said that he intends to give the green light to the two contentious pipelines, and I expect that this is only the beginning. Meanwhile, in my opinion, midstream pipeline stocks are cheap after the thrashing they took in 2015. So, in my opinion, adding MLPs such as Kinder Morgan Inc (KMI) to your portfolio makes sense.Or you could add Energy Transfer Equity LP (ETE).   BONDS Hear me out. I’m actually not going to recommend that you back up the truck and load up on bonds. Even after the massive surge in yields in 2016, in my opinion, bonds still don’t yield enough to be worth a major speculative allocation right now. But let’s say that you’re in or near retirement and that you’re investing along the lines of a traditional 60/40 portfolio. The bonds aren’t going to be a major source of return at current yields, but they could definitely still be valuable as volatility reducers. And this would seem like a sensible time to rebalance. Stocks have been flying ever since the election, but bonds are down sharply. Overheated Stocks I expect stocks to cool down, at least for a few months, and I expect bonds to recoup a fair bit of their losses. We may not see bond yields back at July levels again, but I do expect them to be lower than they are today. In my view, the market is spooked that republican control of Congress and the presidency will lead to large deficits and resurgent inflation. But if large deficits were all that it took to stoke inflation, then Japan would have the highest inflation in the world right now. It doesn’t. So, if you’re due for a portfolio rebalance, I believe this would be a sensible time to do it, when stocks risen a little too far too fast, and bonds have fallen a little too far too fast. One suggestion is the iShares 7-10 Year Treasury Bond ETF (IEF), which holds intermediate-term bonds.   CONSUMER STAPLES While the broad market is expensive right now, not all sectors are equally overpriced. Some, like automakers, are actually pretty cheap. But consumer staples stocks are just about prohibitively expensive. Investors have been wary of this bull market for year and have responded by staying invested, but doing so by overweighting the sectors that are traditionally considered the most conservative, such as consumer staples. The result has been an overpricing of these “safe” sectors to the point that they are no longer safe.   Rich Valuations Even the most stable and predictable business can be a lousy buy at a price that is too high. Procter & Gamble Co (PG) and Colgate-Palmolive Company (CL) sport price-to-earnings ratios north of 20. Not worth it, in my view. My advice is to stick with cheap consumer cyclicals via the Consumer Discretionary SPDR ETF (XLY). As I mentioned, automakers are particularly cheap, and the market seems to be pricing in steep declines in sales. So if anything other than the worst-case scenario happens, I believe cheap consumer discretionary stocks should do just fine.   Photo Credit: Nigel Howe via Flickr Creative Commons The following is an excerpt from an article originally published on InvestorPlace. Charles Sizemore Charles Sizemore Dividend Growth The Dividend Growth portfolio selects dividend-paying stocks that I believe will provide an attractive income over the next decade and beyond. I believe a fundamental shift in investor preferences is occurring that favors income over growth. This is due, in part, to the aging of America’s Baby Boomers. At the same time, I see traditional income investments such as bonds and certificates of deposit currently offering unattractive yields that are quite low. Manager Benchmark S&P 500 Strategic Growth Allocation The Strategic Growth Allocation portfolio is Sizemore Capital’s answer to traditional asset allocation. It invests primarily using ETFs. The portfolio is appropriate for risk-averse investors that prefer a more passive "buy and hold" strategy that is consistent with their risk and return goals.   My goal is to achieve returns comparable to the S&P 500 Index while potentially taking on less risk.

One of the most important factors responsible for this stability is the demand for healthy, lustrous, and manageable hair and this need drives the purchase decisions of most consumers. The global hair care market was valued at US$81.3 bn in 2015 and is expected to reach US$105.3 bn by 2024, registering a steady 3.0% CAGR during the forecast period. Download Research Brochure PDF@ www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag… The market for hair care products expected to grow significantly across developing and developed regions owing to increasing R&D activities for the enhancement of these products. Moreover, an emphasis on innovation in technology for the formulation of new hair care products is expected to impact the market globally. Availability of Variety of Hair Styling Products and Devices a Key Factor In terms of revenue, the shampoo segment accounts for the dominant share in the hair care market, and registered a 30.9% share in 2015. The shampoo market is gaining popularity thanks to product innovation based on evolving customer needs. The major players offering a wide variety of shampoos in the market include Procter & Gamble Co., L’Oréal S.A., and Unilever plc. Hair styling products form a highly attractive segment in the hair care market and is projected to expand at a 4.4% CAGR. Hair styling products include mousse, holding sprays, heat-resistant sprays, sprays for curly hair, serums, and gels. The growing demand for hair styling products due to the changing purchasing behavior and patterns of consumers is likely to boost this product segment. A key trend noted in this segment is the fact that local manufacturers in Africa and APAC have been focusing on new product development and innovation catering to consumer preferences so as to establish a loyal customer base over the years. Hair colors are gradually witnessing increased demand across the globe. This can be attributed to the ever-rising influence of the fashion industry and a rise in the global aging population. A recent trend noted in this segment is an increase in male consumers.

(WMT) and the Terrible Trump Tariff Trump promises a 5% import tariff, and Amazon continues to steal foot traffic. WMT stock is in trouble.

Friday’s Vital Data: Microsoft Corporation (MSFT), Starbucks Corporation (SBUX) and Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) 2 Ways to Play Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Q4 Earnings View All Posts The new year could be a rough one for Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) and other brick-and-mortar retailers. Not only are they seeing their worst foot traffic since 1972 as Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) flexes its online muscles, but President-elect Donald Trump has said that he is considering an executive action to impose a 5% tariff on imports — news that sent WMT stock plunging last week. Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr And we haven’t even touched on Trump’s increasingly rocky relationship with China, which threatens to kick off a trade war with one of the largest suppliers of cheaply manufactured U.S. imports — and one of the largest holders of U.S. debt. The wealth of pressure facing Walmart stock has already sent analysts running for the sidelines. According to data from Thomson/First Call, 21 of the 30 analysts following WMT stock rate the shares a hold or worse. Meanwhile, the 12-month price target rests at $74.59, representing a premium of about 7.91% to yesterday’s close. Should Trump impose his tariff, or Amazon continue to take market share, we could see more analysts revise their outlooks downward. That would pile additional pressure on Walmart stock. Elsewhere, Walmart short sellers smell blood in the water. During the most recent reporting period, WMT edged out Procter & Gamble Co (NYSE:PG) as the 12th most shorted stock on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Some 28 million shares of WMT stock are now sold short, representing about 2% of Walmart’s total float. Look for shorting activity to pick up sharply if Trump gets his way. As a clear sign that short sellers are not worried in the least about a potential WMT rally, options activity has grown increasingly put-heavy. Currently, the January/February put/call open interest ratio stands at 1.26, with puts easily outnumbering calls among short-term options. Typically, short sellers will buy up calls as a hedge against potential rallies in the underlying stock, but this is far from the case with WMT. Click to Enlarge Looking out to the February series to judge the potential impact of an incoming Trump presidency, implieds are pricing in a potential move of about 3.6% for WMT stock. This is more inline with implieds surrounding an earnings report than the stock’s historically lower volatility readings. As a result, the upper bound lies at $71.24, while the lower bound lies at $66.26. Technically, the upper bound lies well short of recent resistance near $72, while the lower bound rests well below key short-term support levels and WMT stock’s October lows. What does this mean for those looking to trade?

Mark Moran cv01traverp5 Steve Traver, auctioneer at Travers Auctions prepares for his annual New Years Day auction in Dallas. Mark Moran cv01traverp4 Image Gallery for UP FOR GRABS Lightbox link Lightbox link Lightbox link Lightbox link DALLAS — Today, hundreds of people will trek miles from around Pennsylvania, Ohio, Maryland, and as far away as Texas, to buy antiques in the Back Mountain. This is the 20th annual New Year’s Day auction organized by Traver’s Auctions. Traver’s holds approximately 50 auctions per year, but this one draws the most bidders — between 300 and 400. Other auctions bring about 150 bidders, Steve Traver said. Before the auction starts at 11 a.m., an inspection starts at 9 a.m. The auction typically lasts between five and six hours at the auction barn at 56 Dorchester Drive in Dallas. Apart from the 300 to 400 bidders that come New Year’s Day, people can also make absentee bids or bid over the phone. Two items have drawn particular interest from absentee bidders and people planning to attend: an 1867 United States Military Academy photo album featuring cadets who later became famous captains and generals, and a 1776 dower chest. Both items have pre-sale estimates between $2,000 and $4,000, Traver said. One antique from a previous auction that community members might recognize is the chandelier from The Sterling Hotel, which now hangs in Canteen 900 at 900 Rutter Ave. in Forty Fort. David Koral, the owner of the building, said he is the third person to buy the chandelier. “When I got it, it was all bent and we had to pick it apart right down to the last bone,” Koral said. It took two months to fix the chandelier, rewiring and repairing crystals with replacements from three locations. Koral buys furniture at the auction, too. “It’s a lot of fun. Everybody comes out of the woodwork, everything sells for a lot of money,” Koral said. Pittston attorney Joseph Castellino originally introduced Koral to the auction. Castellino has gone to Traver’s auctions since they were run out of the Kunkle Community hall, before they set up permanently in Dallas. What sets Traver apart from other auctions is his honesty — he’s built a reputation, bringing bidders in from across the country, Castellino said. “He’s built an empire,” Castellino said. He furnished almost 90 percent of his house with antiques he’s bought from auctions, where you can get quality furniture for a decent price, Castellino said. It is necessary to go in person, because there are different finds at every auction. “If you don’t go, you don’t know,” Castellino said. “It’s not the same online, you have to look at it, feel it, touch it.” Building an auction empire for Traver and his wife came naturally, he said, because antiques are a passion and Northeastern Pennsylvania is a gemstone of local history and antiques. Traver started collecting as a child, when he asked for payment in antiques for helping neighbors in his rural community. Often, the antiques were worth more than wages. “From the time I was young, I’d ask for the trunk in the attic or the crock in the basement to bail hay” Traver said. In 1995, he quit his full-time job at Procter & Gamble to open the auction barn full-time with his wife, Diane. Over the years, the auction has grown in size and attracted people from all over the country. Forty Fort resident Bud Reilly is an avid antique collector, he travels all over the country to buy antiques. Of all the auctions he’s been to, he said Traver’s is his favorite. He’s made sure to never miss a New Year’s Day Auction, even when they were in a small, rented fire hall. “That’s the holy grail of auctions,” Reilly said. “Its just a fun place to go — it’s a great show and he’s an honest guy, which is hard to find in an auctioneer.” This year, Reilly said he’s interested in the dower chest, which Traver got at an estate in Clarks Summit. The photo album is from an estate just outside of New York City in New Jersey. Most of the items are from local estates in Luzerne, Lackawanna, Susquehanna and Wyoming counties.   abutkiewicz@citizensvoice.com 570-821-2072   If you go: What: 20th annual New Year’s antique auction at Traver’s Auctions When: Sunday, Jan. 1. 9 a.m. inspection, 11 a.m. auction Where: Traver’s Auction barn, 56 Dorchester Drive in Dallas We welcome user discussion on our site, under the following guidelines: To comment you must first create a profile and sign-in with a verified DISQUS account or social network ID.

She will be attending St Margaret's Primary School and looks forward to art and craft lessons. ST PHOTO: ARIFFIN JAMAR Chloe Anne Terner, six, will attend St Margaret's Primary School. Her mother is doctor Lee Ching Ching, 39; and her father David Terner, in his 50s, owns an online toy store "I am the only one from my kindergarten going to that school. I think school will be fun and I can learn new things and make many new friends. When I went to the school's orientation in November, I met a girl called Emily who will be in my class. She seems nice. I also like that I'm going to an all-girls school because I think girls are usually nicer. I will have to get up at 6.15am every day and take the school bus to school. This will be fine because I usually sleep at 9pm. My mother has bought my books and school uniform. I like the polka dots on my uniform because they make it look special. My parents say I will get $2.50 a day as pocket money. I haven't bought anything by myself, but I think it will be okay when I get used to it. I hope the canteen has chicken rice because it is my favourite food. At school, I think I will like art and craft lessons the most. And PE (physical education) classes too. I like running, jumping and swimming. But I am not sure I will like Chinese lessons because they can be difficult. I will miss my friends from kindergarten, but my father says he will organise play dates, so I will still get to see them from time to time." Having her first child   Bloop Desserts Studio owner Ong Shi Jie, who is three months pregnant, with her husband Satoshi Hayashi. ST PHOTO: LIM YAOHUI Ms Ong Shi Jie, 27, owner of Bloop Desserts Studio, which organises baking workshops. She is married to Mr Satoshi Hayashi, 31, who works in a bank "I am just three months pregnant and have no idea what motherhood will be like, but I am excited and plan to take the challenges as they come. We don't know the baby's gender yet, but prefer a girl. However, once I tell this to my friends, many say they feel I will have a boy. For now, we call our baby 'our little sushi' because my husband is half-Japanese and both of us like to eat sushi. It's a pity that I cannot eat any now as most sushi contain raw ingredients and I want to play it safe. My husband still eats sushi though and sometimes in front of me. To be fair, I did say it was fine for him to do so. I guess getting to smell the sushi is better than nothing. I have been very lucky - I've had no morning sickness and few strange cravings. I don't think my tummy is showing yet and my friends tell me to use this opportunity to get everything we need. By the third trimester, I am told, I would feel so tired that I would just want to lie down all the time. I am tracking my pregnancy on my Instagram (@shhhijie) and Dayre accounts. We are setting up a nursery and our friends have given us baby clothes, asking us not to buy any as the child will outgrow them quickly. We have bought some pregnancy books and are looking around for more deals. The baby is due on June 29. I know my life will change forever, but I regard it as a new phase of life. A random thought: My husband's birthday is on July 3. Wouldn't it be weird if our baby ends up having the same birthday as him? It will be my birthday present to him." Releasing their first EP   Singapore indie band Gilded Edge, comprising(from left) singer and guitarist Alan Francis,guitarist Melvin Lim, drummer Julian Stewart and bassist Nur Afiq Yusof, will be releasing their first EP in April. ST PHOTO: ARIFFIN JAMAR Nur Afiq Yusof, 26, bassist of local indie band Gilded Edge, single. The other band members are singer and guitarist Alan Francis, 25; guitarist Melvin Lim, 25; and drummer Julian Stewart, 23 "Not many people have heard of our band because we were formed only in 2015, but that is going to change in a big way this year. We just performed at The Float@Marina Bay yesterday at the Rock On! 2017 countdown concert. Our first EP is also slated to be released in April. Its working title is 'cwtch', a Welsh word meaning a cuddle or hug, and it will have five songs, all written by Alan, our lead singer. Through it, we hope to share our brand of music - a mix of 1990s grunge and Brit pop from the 2000s. The main song is The Walking Dead, a big, emotional anthem about the difference between love and lust. The chorus will have you singing along. Another song, Swaggerbones, is a fun, bluesy rock number with a funky baseline and tongue-in- cheek lyrics. Then there is All I Want To Do Is Dance. The title says it all - it will get you on your feet, grooving along. If I had to pin it down, I guess our music is about being a 20something guy - growing up and having a good time. There might be frustrations, self-doubt and failed romances along the way, but that is part of being young. After all, we are very much a millennial band. For the launch, we've been working extremely hard, jamming several times a week on top of our day jobs. I freelance in the film and TV production industry. When the EP is launched, it will be available on Spotify, iTunes and CDs. We will also do a live music showcase here and a long weekend tour in Kuala Lumpur. An EP is our first step. We want to release full-length albums and be recognised on the scene."

He is engaged to Ms Priscilla Phuah, 33, who works in the same bank "I proposed to my fiancee in 2015 and we plan to get married on June 10 this year. A fortune teller told us it is an auspicious date and we have booked our hotel for the wedding reception. We are also having a church wedding, but other than that, I am leaving the planning to my fiancee because she has a better idea of how she wants the wedding to be. I just hope everything goes smoothly and everyone enjoys themselves. We bought a 840 sq ft condominium near Woodleigh MRT last November. Renovations will be completed this month and we will move in. We are currently living with our respective parents. Thinking back, we spent practically every weekend last year househunting and saw about 40 properties altogether. There was always something not right, until we came across this place. We like it because it is near both our parents and the MRT and it has a full kitchen. I can cook and she can bake - these are activities both of us like very much. Although it cost about $1 million, we have been saving for this since we started working. When it is ready, the place will have a mid-20th-century look, with an industrial theme fused with vintage elements. I intend to bring over some furniture from my grandfather's place, where I grew up, and the items will make the place feel like home. Two milestones in a year might seem like a lot, but I'm not afraid. Challenges are what make us stronger. I am excited to have my own place and elated to live there with the love of my life." Publishing her first book   Ms Nuraliah Norasid holding a mock-up of her debut novel, The Gatekeeper, which will be published by Epigram Books this year. PHOTO: DIOS VINCOY JR FOR THE SUNDAY TIMES Ms Nuraliah Norasid, 30, research associate, single. She won Singapore's richest literary award, the Epigram Books Fiction Prize, last year and her debut novel, The Gatekeeper, will be published by Epigram Books this year "My 85,000-word novel has been in the making for more than 10 years and I am looking forward to its publication. It is a work of speculative fiction, blending Greek mythology with Malay folkloric elements, and the idea came to me in 2006 while I was pursuing my university studies, being a part-time barista and giving tuition on the side. Since then, I have been developing this novel all over Singapore - writing in cafes, libraries and even void decks, wherever I can. I prefer to write on the go and outside my home. Strangely enough, this helps me focus. I hand-write my manuscript - including all descriptions, dialogue and character notes. Writing on paper allows my thoughts to flow better and gives my mind time to think through ideas. It is not easy finding time to write. Sometimes, I write on the bus or MRT in between tuition sessions. Nowadays, I try to get up at 5am to write before I go to work. Sometimes, I stay back for an hour after work to write. Sounds tedious? I actually feel fine with the hard work. Every writer has to go through it to develop his characters. Even now, I know there is still a lot of work left to do. I am told at least 1,000 copies of my book will be published. This is more than I expected. I used to think that as long as I got the book published and a few people read it and cared for the characters, I would have achieved my goal. For my novel to have gotten so much attention and acclaim, I am very grateful." Opening his first restaurant   Mr Yong Tet Sin in his restaurant, Half Pound Burger Bar & Grill. He took his retrenchment last year as a sign to fulfil his dream of opening a restaurant. ST PHOTO: ALPHONSUS CHERN Mr Yong Tet Sin, 55, married to Ms Linda Teh, 50, who owns a packaging materials business. They have two sons, aged 21 and 12, who are students "I am looking forward to the grand opening of my first restaurant, Half Pound Burger Bar & Grill at 8 Purvis Street, in two weeks. It is a 1,200 sq ft single-storey establishment selling American burgers and dishes such as fish and chips, pasta, grilled fish, mussels and scallops. But these are not fast food. We serve craft burgers using imported Australian beef and our ingredients are bought from good, reliable suppliers. Burgers are among my favourite foods. About 30 years ago, I lived in the United States for five years as a university student and enjoyed the burgers there. I used to be a sourcing manager at a Japanese manufacturing company here, but was retrenched early last year, when the company underwent restructuring. I took this as a blessing. I have always wanted to start my own restaurant and getting retrenched was a sign for me. So I found a unit which was formerly a Japanese restaurant and spent $200,000 renovating and setting up my eatery. I chose orange as its main colour because I wanted it to feel cosy and relaxed. I had wooden wine crates nailed onto the walls as part of the decor as they look interesting and my restaurant serves wine and beer. I will be the one serving the drinks. A chef will prepare the food and I have eight other staff such as waiters and cleaners. My dream? To open another three outlets of this restaurant within two or three years. It is ambitious, but I want to dream big." Starting a new job   Mr Kelvin Yeo quit his public relations and communications job after an unexpected medical episode and will be teaching at Singapore Management University and the National University of Singapore this year. ST PHOTO: JONATHAN CHOO Mr Kelvin Yeo, 54, a former public relations and communications consultant, will start a new job at Singapore Management University (SMU) as an adjunct faculty member in its Lee Kong Chian School of Business. He is married to Ms Jean Pang, a wedding decor designer, and they have no children "I have been in the PR and communications business for almost 30 years, working with big names such as Procter & Gamble, Gardens by the Bay and Netflix. However, as my career progressed and the higher I climbed, I realised my job increasingly became about business targets and numbers, rather than advising clients or creating and leading PR campaigns. As time went by, I realised I was enjoying the job less. Around my 50th birthday, I started thinking about what I could do after my agency career. Something I could get passionate about. Something I could switch to when I turned 60. I knew I enjoyed corporate training as I was already training clients in communications skills, leadership, crisis and media interaction as part of my job. I decided to give teaching a try as it seemed a natural extension of training. So I prepared myself by doing a master's in communication management and also became a part-time lecturer at the National University of Singapore (NUS). Seeing students suddenly get a concept, or remember something I taught, was very fulfilling. Life also throws curveballs. An unexpected medical episode early last year - which required three operations and a two-month hospital stay - made me rethink my career plans. Since my recovery required a major lifestyle change in terms of my diet, exercise regimen and stress levels, I decided to make my planned switch ahead of schedule. I quit my agency job last year and will teach at both NUS and SMU this year. I know teaching will bring its own set of challenges, but I am excited to face them head on."
