Baker (Staff Writer) / Published: October 13, 2012 Article Tools Font size – + Share This     The Citizens' Voice file Joseph Bartorillo of Larksville was convicted of tampering with a consumer product, indecent assault and stalking for injecting semen into his co-workers' yogurt. The victims in a yogurt tampering case that brought about convictions in Wyoming County and federal courts against a fellow employee, have filed a lawsuit against their employer, Procter & Gamble. Sara Michaels, of Laceyville, and Teresa Davenport, of Wyalusing, filed the lawsuit through their attorney James Carroll Jr. in Bradford County Court, alleging that P&G intentionally inflicted emotional distress, negligently inflicted emotional distress and violated the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act. Earlier this year, Larksville resident Joseph Bartorillo was sentenced to two years in federal prison for tampering with a consumer product. In March, he also was sentenced in Wyoming County Court to six months in state prison on two charges of indecent assault and two charges of stalking. He is incarcerated in a federal penitentiary in Lisbon, Ohio. According to the suit, Michaels reported seven specific instances of yogurt tampering to P&G, while Davenport reported one. It claims P&G "failed in its duty to protect its employees by not adequately monitoring the work place, either before the incidents took place, but more importantly, after P&G was informed that someone was tampering with employee lunches." The lawsuit charges that both plaintiffs "suffered severe psychological injuries, fear, suspicion, invasion of privacy and severe emotional distress" and have had to undergo medical testing and psychological counseling. Alex Fried, spokesman for the P&G-Mehoopany plant, said he couldn't comment on pending litigation. "But, what I can tell you," Fried said, "is that the safety of our employees is of utmost importance, and as soon as we were made of aware of the incident, we investigated and sought the assistance of law enforcement." Michaels, who worked in information technology at Procter & Gamble in Washington Township until about two months ago, claims that on July 9, 2010, she made her first report to the P&G security office that her lunches had been tampered with. Davenport, another IT worker who is still employed at P&G and did not know Michaels well, said she made her first complaint to a yogurt company on Aug. 25, 2010. "Despite plaintiffs' repeated requests for concrete action, such as security cameras, etc., nothing concrete was done by P&G security or management," the suit alleges and no samples were sent to a testing lab until November. The lawsuit notes the last incident took place a full 326 days after Michaels' first report to P&G security. Because the plaintiffs believe P&G's actions were intentional, willful, wanton, reckless and indifferent conduct" they are seeking in excess of the local arbitration limit of $30,000, exclusive of court costs and punitive damages on a charge of intentional infliction of emotional distress. The plaintiffs are also charging Bartorillo with a count of assault and battery and another of intentional infliction of emotional distress and seeking a judgment in excess of local arbitration limits in each matter. bbaker@wcexaminer.com We welcome user discussion on our site, under the following guidelines: To comment you must first create a profile and sign-in with a verified DISQUS account or social network ID.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 13 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman MENA Cosmetic Skin Care Market: Rising Demand for Anti-aging Products to Emerge as Chief Growth Driver Irrespective of the high demand for cosmetic skin care, the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) market for the same exhibits a moderately consolidated vendor landscape. L’Oreal S.A., Unilever Group, Procter & Gamble, Avon Products, and Beiersdorf AG led the market in 2015, holding a share of nearly 45.3%. Of these, the dominance of L’Oreal S.A. is attributable to its widespread global presence. Besides this, the aforementioned companies have a diversifying product portfolio, which has significantly helped them gain traction in the region, finds Transparency Market Research (TMR) in a new study. Furthermore, these companies focuses on product innovation, to cater to the dynamic needs of consumers. Innovative marketing strategies hold key to the success of the companies operating in the cosmetic skin care market. For companies operating in the cosmetic industry, it is imperative to maintain goodwill. “Loss of brand-identity can cost companies heftily hence a considerable investment towards PR campaigns is noted,” observed the TMR report’s author. Also a majority of the prominent names in the MENA cosmetic skin care market strive to strengthen their research activities, which has an overall positive impact. Browse Report: www.transparencymarketresearch.com/mena-cosmetic-skin-car… According to TMR, the MENA cosmetic skin care market, which stood at US$3.18 bn in 2015, is projected to reach US$6.29 bn by the end of 2024. If these figures hold true, the cosmetic skin care market in MENA will exhibit a CAGR of 8.0% between 2016 and 2024. By product-type, the anti-aging skin care segment held the lead in the market with a share of 25.2% in 2015. As consumers around the world become more willing to spend on beauty products promising reduced signs of aging, the demand from this segment is likely to rise higher. Regionally, the Middle East held dominance with a share of 69.6% in the overall market in 2015. Furthermore, TMR projects the region to remain dominant through the course of the forecast period. Fill the form for an exclusive sample of this report @ www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag… Aging Population and Rising Focus on Physical Appearances to Fuel Growth The primary driver of the market is growth in aging population. Consumers in general have become more conscious about their aesthetic than ever. The demand for anti-aging creams and different skincare lotions has therefore surged tremendously, enabling the market gain considerable momentum. Besides this, the growing awareness about the availability of these products has acted as a chief driver of the cosmetic skin care products market in MENA. Also the rising affordability of consumers across this region has enabled the market’s growth. The rapidly growing economies and political stability are the two key aspects to have attracted the most popular names in the cosmetic industry to this region. The rising disposable income of consumers in the region has helped strengthening distribution channels such spas and hypermarkets. This has helped the market players cater to the rising demand better, subsequently facilitating growth in the market. As the leading companies toy with various strategies to gain competitive advantage, investment in research activities has emerged as the most viable resort. Functional improvements in skin care cosmetics, offering innovations aimed at dynamic consumer preference, and offering better quality products are therefore a few of the most-widely adopted strategies by market players that have had a positive impact on the overall market.

This should be welcome news for all Americans, considering it has been over 30 years since the U.S. tax code was reformed. During that time, while other countries have modernized their tax codes, the U.S. has stood still — and even increased our tax rates. Today, American businesses suffer from a tax rate of 39%, while their foreign counterparts face an average tax rate of 25%.

The deal, said to be the second largest in Infor's history, is expected to close within 45 days. Because GT Nexus is a fully cloud-based supply-chain platform, it will help Infor to accelerate its shift from on-premises software to true multitenant cloud, said Paul Hamerman, a Forrester Research analyst. "It also aligns well with Infor's focus on manufacturing industries." GT Nexus' global trade and logistics software is designed to let companies in industries like retail, fashion and manufacturing to collaborate with global suppliers and optimize shipments to customers, distribution centers and retailers. Founded in 1998 and based in California, GT Nexus has a network that integrates directly into buyers' and suppliers' order-management systems and allows buyers to transmit order information through GT Nexus to their suppliers, financial institutions, freight carriers and logistics providers. Some 25,000 businesses use the technology to manage more than $100 billion in goods each year. GT Nexus customers include Adidas, Caterpillar, Columbia Sportswear, DHL, Home Depot, Levi Strauss, Maersk, Pfizer, Procter & Gamble and UPS. The union of the two companies will let Infor offer customers a global commerce cloud that gives them "end to end" control and visibility for the production of direct goods, according to Infor. In that sense, it will give Infor stronger footing in its bid to compete in the cloud with the likes of Oracle and SAP. The acquisition will open up new opportunities for Infor customers, said Ray Wang, founder and principal analyst with Constellation Research. That's particularly true in the retail industry, which has been a key focus of the company's recent efforts, he noted. "This focus on the retail supply chain is an important piece of the Infor puzzle," he said. "This is an area that Infor has expressed a strong desire to become a major player in. With this news, it might just achieve that goal."

The beauty company is working with Suez, a company that provides solutions for the sustainable management of resources, to create processes that will improve resource management throughout its industrial, administrative and research centers, both in France and worldwide, L’Oreal says. L’Oreal will also be working with Suez to measure, monitor and optimize energy and water consumption at its sites, and will be looking at implementing energy solutions based on options like generating biomass from waste streams. The beauty company says that, in the long-term, it will be focusing on becoming a “circular economy” by focusing on biodiversity, ecodesign, digitalization, and material reuse and recovery. The partnership with Suez will allow L’Oreal to take its environmental work “even further,” by using technology to improve performance, the company says. ‘Circular Cosmetics’ The circular economy has been an increasingly popular phrase in the cosmetics industry. Results from a Pure Strategies survey last December found that top-performing companies, including beauty companies like Unilever and others in the personal care and cosmetics industry, generate twice as much value from circular economy and resource efficiency initiatives compared to their peers. Unilever reported 30% faster growth for its brands with a sustainability purpose, compared to the rest of its business, with these more sustainable products contributing nearly half of the firm’s total growth in 2015. In January, Unilever pledged 100% of its plastic packaging will be fully reusable, recyclable or compostable by 2025. And Procter & Gamble, with recycling and environmental management companies TerraCycle as well as Suez, developed the world’s first recyclable shampoo bottle made from up to 25 percent recycled beach plastic. A slew of recent “sustainable brand” acquisitions by multinationals also appeared to indicate the profitability of these brands and their ability to help the purchasing companies meet their own internal environmental goals. Last year, Unilever bought sustainable household products manufacturer Seventh Generation and SC Johnson purchased the plant-based home and personal care products brand Babyganics. Some Consumers Think a Circular Cosmetics Economy Isn’t Enough Despite the significant environmental moves the beauty industry is making, there are other areas within the areas of environment, health and safety that must be addressed, according to some public interest groups. This week, Campaign for Safe Cosmetics, Safer Chemicals Healthy Families, and the US Public Interest Research Group delivered more than 150,000 petition signatures calling on L’Oreal to eliminate “cancer causing chemicals” and to disclose its “secret fragrance chemicals.” Earlier this year, Unilever announced that it would disclose most of its fragrance ingredients by 2018.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 13 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Global Fatty Alcohols Market – Rising Demand for Personal Care Products in Asia Pacific By 2023 Fatty Alcohols Market Fatty alcohols are predominantly monohydric and linear aliphatic alcohols that can be obtained from natural or synthetic sources such as paraffin, olefins, oils, waxes, and fats. Fatty alcohols are also called long chain alcohols and are broadly classified into C15-C22, C11-14, C6-C10, and other based on the length of the carbon chain in their configuration. Fatty alcohols find diverse applications across many industries such as plasticizers, personal care, soaps, detergents, cosmetics metal working, and flavors and fragrances. The market is chiefly driven by excellent growth of major end-use industries such as detergents and soaps and personal care in the past few years. However, factors such as volatile raw material prices and excess production of fatty alcohols are expected to restrain the overall growth of the global fatty alcohols market over the forecast period. Nevertheless, the rising demand for beauty products and cosmetics in BRIC countries will provide excellent growth opportunities for the market over the forecast period. Browse Market Research Report @ www.transparencymarketresearch.com/fatty-alcohols-market…. Volume-wise, the segment of C11-C14 fatty alcohols dominated the market, accounting for a share of nearly 50% in the global market in 2014. Broad set of applications of C11-C14 fatty alcohols is the major factor driving their demand across the globe. This product segment is also expected to emerge as the fastest growing segment of the market over the forecast period. Detergents and soaps emerged as the major application segment for the fatty alcohols market in 2014, accounting for a dominant share of over 60% in the global market. The application segment of personal care is expected to exhibit excellent growth, leading to an increased demand for a variety of fatty alcohols over the forecast period. Demand for fatty alcohols in the personal care is expected to expand at the fastest pace amongst other application areas over the forecast period. Fill the form to gain deeper insights on this market @ www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag… The key regional markets meticulously studied in the report are Latin America, Asia Pacific, Europe, North America, and the Middle East and Africa. Asia Pacific will continue to dominate the market throughout the forecast period, closely trailed by North America. The APAC region is a site of high growth rate across the world owing to the improving lifestyles, rising disposable income, and rapidly growing population along with the expanding base of middle-class population in emerging countries such as China and India. The growth of the region can also be attributed to the rising demand for soaps and detergents and beauty products and the abundant availability of raw materials. Demand for C11-C14 Fatty Alcohols to Remain High through 2023 On the basis of type, fatty alcohols are fragmented into C15-C22, C11-C14, C6-C10, and others (such as C23). The C11-C14 segment will continue to dominate the market in terms of volume until 2023. Diverse applications of C11-C14 fatty alcohols is propelling the growth of the segment. The segment is expected to expand at a CAGR higher than any other segment during the forecast period. The demand for C15-C22 fatty alcohols is also likely to increase at a noteworthy pace during the same period owing to the growing demand for personal care products.

These are used in order to treat constipation. They are used to treat the passage of small amounts of hard and dry stools. Laxatives are generally taken three times a week. They are preferred as medication when remedies such as increase in fiber diet, drinking plenty of water and regular exercise have not helped to cure constipation. Occasional constipation is often treated without laxatives. Laxatives are available as OTC drugs without the need of prescriptions. Although laxatives are present in the market for a longer period of time there is insufficient evidence available about the efficacy of laxatives over each other. Adults usually don’t require prescription for consumption of laxatives as they are easily available as OTC drugs. In children laxatives are only advised to be taken through prescription. The nature of laxatives depends on whether it degenerates the nerves in the intestine or dulling the natural response that will stimulate the peristalsis movement.

According to route of administration the market is segmented is into oral and rectal. According to the types of laxatives the market is segmented into bulk forming laxatives, osmotic laxatives, stimulant laxatives and stool softener laxatives. Bulk forming laxatives show their effect after 12-24 hours of administration, osmotic laxatives such as lactulose show their effect after 2-3 days of administration, stimulant laxatives usually work within 6-12 hours of administration and stool softener laxatives work within 12 to 72 hours of administration. According to type of product the laxatives are segmented according to dosage form such as tablets, capsules, powder, suppositories, liquids and gels According to distribution channel the market is segmented into retail pharmacies, hospital pharmacies, drug store and online pharmacies. Geographically, the laxatives market can be segmented into North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America and Middle East and Africa. Constipation has become one of the major problems amongst the majority population due to sedentary life style. Sedentary life style includes unhealthy eating habits, less hours of sleep, irregular meal timings and lack of exercise which causes gastric imbalance which can further lead to constipation. This is the major driving factor for the growth of laxative market in the forecast period. Obesity is also a major factor responsible for constipation, hence rising obese cases are one the major reason for the growth of laxative market. Few of the restraints in the laxative market can be due to the side effects of laxatives which are bloating, flatulence, abdominal cramps, feeling sick and dehydration. The side effects caused are generally not taken into more consideration as the constipation itself is a troublesome condition. Use of laxatives as in treatment of obesity has also been one of the restraining factor for the laxative market.

A £25m arts centre to be built on a derelict plot that had not felt a cultural pulse since the closure, 15 years earlier, of the legendary Haçienda nightclub. It would be called Home, formed by the merger of two proud but financially imperilled institutions – the Cornerhouse cinema and gallery, and the Library Theatre Company – and would, its backers hoped, revive a forgotten corner on the city’s southern edge. “There was confidence from the city leadership that it would work, but a lot of my peers and colleagues in the arts were saying to me, ‘Who’s going to go there?’” says Sheena Wrigley, executive director of Home, which includes two theatres, five cinema screens, an art gallery and a restaurant and bar. “It was a very unprepossessing area with a big car park and one large office block. It wasn’t visible or on a main thoroughfare.” Programming would swim far from the mainstream, too. The centre opened in May 2015 with a challenging play about two thwarted lovers trying to survive a recession in a city like Manchester. This week the cinema is showing Lady Macbeth, a subversive Shakespearean noir, and The Handmaiden, an erotic Korean period thriller. The free gallery includes an exhibition of vibrant art from post-Franco Spain and an exploration of the role of vogueing in gay black culture. Wrigley admits to having been nervous when she and her team set an ambitious target of 550,000 visits for the first year. “But we smashed that in six months and did just shy of a million,” she says. And they kept coming: as Home approaches its second birthday, it is about to welcome its two-millionth visitor. “It’s fascinating to me that you can open a venue of this kind and size and it can find its audience straight away in a difficult period,” Wrigley adds. “Of course, I would like to say it’s all about good artistic choices, but something else is going on.” Wrigley is right. A series of studies is revealing strange things about our spending habits. They call it the “experience economy”, which gives it the sense of a grand theory. And there is science behind it, but it’s also very simple: regardless of political uncertainty, austerity and inflation, we are spending more on doing stuff, choosing instead to cut back on buying stuff. Facebook Twitter Pinterest The restaurant at Home, a major new arts centre in Manchester. Photograph: Alamy The latest figures come from Barclaycard, which processes about half of all Britain’s credit and debit card transactions. Figures for April show a 20% increase in spending in pubs compared with the same month last year. Spending in restaurants went up 16%, while theatres and cinemas enjoyed a 13% rise. Meanwhile, department stores suffered a 1% drop, vehicle sales were down 11% and spending on household appliances fell by 2.5%. Barclaycard says the trend began to emerge about a year ago. And retailers are feeling it. In March, Simon Wolfson, chief executive of Next, blamed the clothing chain’s first fall in profits for eight years on the move from buying things to doing things. More startlingly, Ikea, the world’s biggest furniture retailer, told a Guardian conference last year that consumption of many goods had reached a limit. “If we look on a global basis, in the west we have probably hit peak stuff,” said Steve Howard, the company’s head of sustainability. It would be easy to assume that contemporary influences are at work here. The world is a bit of a depressing place right now, so let’s have a nice evening out rather than buy a sixth pair of shoes. But theories abound of a much broader shift. And Ikea is arguably late in calling “peak stuff”. In 2011, Chris Goodall, a British environment writer, used government data called the UK’s Material Flows Account to track consumption of stuff, and identified 2001 as a tipping point, long before the 2008 recession and everything that followed. He believed we had “decoupled” economic growth and material consumption. And as we consume less, we are doing more. “If you think about the 20th century, the big dominant value system was materialism, the belief that if we had more stuff we’d be happier,” says James Wallman, a trend forecaster and the author of Stuffocation: Living More with Less, in which he charts the move from possessions to experience. “The big change to what I call experientialism is more about finding happiness and status in experiences instead.” The happiness bit perhaps stands to reason, but studies suggest the anticipation of an experience has a crucial, additional value. In a 2014 paper called Waiting for Merlot, psychologists Amit Kumar, Thomas Gilovich and Matthew Killingsworth showed how people report being mostly frustrated before the planned purchase of a thing, but mostly happy before they bought an experience. That feeling lingers longer, too, tied up as it is with memory. “We call it hedonic adaptation,” says Colin Strong, the head of behavioural science at Ipsos, the market research group. “And the hedonic payoff of experiences is much greater.” We are also less likely to compare experiential purchases than we are products, in a way that means we are all happy with what we buy, regardless of what we can afford. “So if you have a Nissan and your neighbour has a Porsche, there’s no doubt who has the better car, and if you ask the Nissan driver to swap, they will,” Wallman says. “But if you ask people who went on holiday to the Seychelles or south Wales, it’s clear who had the fancier holiday, but surveys show the person who went to Wales won’t swap because they had an equally good time.” If the experience economy has a levelling effect, research also suggests that part of the reason for its rise is its greater potential as a status booster. This supports the idea, questioned by some (and not backed up by Barclaycard, which does not account for age), that younger people – namely millennials – are driving the consumer shift. “It used to be that our car, or handbag or wallet showed our status. Now we post Facebook pictures from a chairlift in Chamonix or the latest music festival,” Wallman says. “Social media is supporting this change. Posting pictures of what you just bought is gauche; posting pictures of something you’re doing is fine.” Strong also thinks the “slightly impoverished nature of millennials” is compelling them to get out more.

Now we post Facebook pictures from a chairlift in Chamonix or the latest music festival.’ Photograph: Yasuyoshi Chiba/AFP/Getty At Home, however, Wrigley says that while students and young professionals are pouring through the doors, the venue’s appeal is crossing generations. “A lot of arts organisations peak at around age 45, but ours is very flat,” she says. “We have a lot of older explorers – people who worked in professional services or local government, say, and are looking for a quality experience. And baby boomers who have been able to stop work in their 60s and have pensions to spend.” Restaurants are capitalising fast, opening at a record pace in cities all over the country. In London, restaurant guide Harden’s counted 200 new openings in its 2017 edition. Cities including Manchester and Glasgow have seen similar or even greater booms. Russell Norman, founder of the Venetian-inspired Polpo restaurants, is about to open his 12th outpost in Bristol, having taken the chain to Brighton, Exeter and Leeds since it landed in London in 2008. The restaurants are as busy as ever, but Norman has been surprised by booming recent demand for gift vouchers and private party requests. “When we opened in Exeter we expected it to be an all-day offering, but we’re really finding that people are coming for special occasions, as an event, or an experience,” he says. Businesses already dealing in experiences are enhancing them to benefit from the shifting economy. Theatres would once never have considered putting a restaurant downstairs, but now you’d be mad not to. The restaurant at Home in Manchester is taking £2m a year, Wrigley says, almost double what was expected. At the Chichester Festival Theatre, where ticket sales are up 12% on last year, the restaurant is booming, too. “We don’t have to be just excellent theatre-makers, but excellent business people,” says Rachel Tackley, the executive director at the venue in West Sussex. “It’s about creating theatres as destinations where you can spend more than two and a half hours watching the show.” Marston’s, one of the country’s largest pub groups, with more than 1,500 pubs, is racing to meet demand for more than pints of beer. Traditionally “people use pubs, but go to restaurants,” says the Wolverhampton-based firm’s managing director, Pete Dalzell. The group has shed hundreds of “wet-led” traditional pubs in recent years, and opened more than 150 pub-restaurants since 2009. Last year revenues were up 7% to £905.8m, and the average pub profit has doubled since 2012. “We’re opening up a new range of offers for consumers who are choosing to spend disposable income doing something with friends rather than buying something,” Dalzell adds. The way we shop now: the revolution in British spending habits Read more If the writing is on the wall for the purveyors of things, their response is to make the walls more appealing. “We’re seeing a fundamental shift in pretty much all categories to retain being much more experiential,” Strong says. Increasingly, this means using technology to create the feeling of a meaningful relationship between brand and buyer, online and offline. High-street clothing stores are deploying shop assistants with tablet computers on which they can call up your previous purchases and tastes based on online browsing. And with smart marketing, even the dullest essentials are being sold as part of a brand experience. In the US, one Los Angeles TV producer, frustrated by the high price of razor blades, launched an online subscription service in 2012. Dollar Shave Club began posting blades for as little as $3 a month and, with the help of a viral ad campaign, earned 12,000 orders in the first two days. Deliveries come with an irreverent magazine. Customers felt part of something, free from the cut-throat corporate economics of brands such as Gillette, which is owned by Procter & Gamble. It soon had more than three million subscribers, and in 2016 Unilever, P&G’s big rival, bought the Dollar Shave Club – and its members – for $1bn. “People have got that we can move from a transactional relationship mediated by big-scale advertising to much more of a one-to-one relationship with the customer,” Strong adds. That relationship is strong in Manchester, where Wrigley says she has been surprised by the scale of Home’s success. The venue is already being overshadowed by rising office and apartment towers, and a new hotel. It has become the beating heart of a neighbourhood that was a wasteland only four years ago. “That’s the magic of experientialism,” Wallman says. “It’s not anti-consumerist or anti-capitalist. Money is still going into the economy and creating jobs – we’re just spending it on experiences.” Wallman, 43, has been following the trend for more than 10 years, and has seen it transform his own life. At his wife’s prompting, he has just acquired a second pair of trousers, but is holding out with his one pair of shoes and five holey T-shirts. “I’d rather do things,” he says. “I took the kids to the Natural History Museum on Sunday. We went camping recently, I go climbing, play football. And it makes us happier.” Topics Consumer spending Restaurants Home in Manchester Theatre Food & drink Consumer affairs features Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Reuse this content View all comments > Order by newest oldest recommendations Show 25 25 50 100 All Threads collapsed expanded unthreaded Loading comments… Trouble loading?

The bipartisan legislation would provide clear and equal protections under federal law for all Americans in vital areas of life, like employment, access to public spaces, housing, credit, education, jury service, and federally-funded programs. Today, in a majority of U.S. states (31), LGBTQ people remain at risk of being fired, evicted or denied services because of who they are. 'No person's fundamental rights should be determined by which side of a state line they live on,' said HRC President Chad Griffin. 'The Equality Act will once and for all end the unacceptable patchwork of non-discrimination laws across this country that leaves LGBTQ people at risk. Every American should have a fair chance to earn a living, provide for their families, and live their lives without fear of discrimination. And at its core, that's what the Equality Act is all about.' Discrimination is a real and persistent problem for far too many LGBTQ Americans. HRC polling has found that nearly two-thirds of self-identified LGBTQ Americans report experiencing discrimination - including people like Carter Brown, a transgender man from Texas who lost his job after he was outed by his colleagues. Currently, 50 percent of LGBTQ Americans like Mr. Brown live in states where they are at risk of being fired, denied housing, or refused service because of who they are. There is no federal law explicitly protecting LGBTQ people from discrimination, and 31 states still lack fully-inclusive non-discrimination protections for LGBTQ people. Today's announcement included unprecedented support from the business community: 92 major corporations have now joined HRC's Business Coalition for the Equality Act. While the overwhelming majority of America's leading businesses have already started addressing workplace fairness for LGBTQ employees, these major employers know how important the need is for a federal standard that treats all employees the same no matter which state they live in. The slate of companies endorsing the Equality Act have combined operations in all 50 states, headquarters spanning 23 states, and collectively generate $2.6 trillion in revenue. In total, these companies employ more than 5.8 million people across the United States. The overwhelming majority of Americans support full federal equality for LGBTQ people. Polling released last year by the nonpartisan Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI) found that support for a bill like the Equality Act topped 70 percent nationally, including a majority of Democrats, Republicans and Independents. PRRI's groundbreaking survey included 42,000 interviews in 50 states and found majority support for the Equality Act in all 50 states. The Equality Act is co-sponsored by 240 members of Congress. It was first introduced in 2015 by Representative David Cicilline (D-RI) and by Senators Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) and Cory Booker (D-NJ). Major corporations in the HRC Business Coalition for the Equality Act include Abercrombie & Fitch Co.; Accenture; Adobe Systems Inc.; Advanced Micro Devices Inc.; Airbnb Inc.; Alcoa Inc.; Amazon.com Inc.; American Airlines; American Eagle Outfitters; American Express Global Business Travel; Apple Inc.; Arconic; Automatic Data Processing Inc.; Bank of America; Best Buy Co., Inc.; Biogen; Boehringer Ingelheim USA Corp.; Booz Allen Hamilton Inc.; Broadridge Financial Solutions Inc.; Brown-Forman Corp.; CA Technologies Inc.; Caesars Entertainment Corp.; Capital One Financial Corp.; Cardinal Health Inc.; Cargill Inc.; Chevron Corp.; Choice Hotels International Inc.; Cisco Systems Inc.; The Coca-Cola Co.; Corning Inc.; Cox Enterprises; CVS Health Corp.; Darden Restaurants Inc.; Delhaize America Inc.; Diageo North America; The Dow Chemical Co.; Dropbox Inc.; E.

The Human Rights Campaign is America's largest civil rights organization working to achieve equality for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer people. HRC envisions a world where LGBTQ people are embraced as full members of society at home, at work and in every community.
