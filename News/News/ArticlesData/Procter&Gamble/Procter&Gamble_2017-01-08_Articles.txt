By TomiKilgore Reporter and editor It’s time to sell the stocks of Coca-Cola Co. and Procter & Gamble Co., according to analysts at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., who turned bearish on the blue-chip consumer staples companies after being neutral on them for over three years. Goldman analyst Judy Hong downgraded Coke KO, -0.17%  to sell, citing expectations that sales growth this year will be “subpar” relative to the global nonalcoholic beverage market, and that the dollar’s strength could restrain earnings growth. She recommended investors focus on beer and energy drink providers over soft drink sellers. “We shift our preference back towards U.S.-centric names, as the recent strengthening of the [U.S. dollar] is causing -- once again -- a negative [earnings-per-share] revision cycle for multinationals and potential corporate tax reform proposals...are likely to disproportionately benefit higher tax-rate, U.S.-centric companies,” while weakness in emerging market currencies hurt demand in those countries,” Hong wrote in a note to clients. The ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY, +0.04%  has surged about 7% since the end of September. See also: Pound hits multiweek lows on fresh Brexit worries. Coke’s stock, a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.03% dropped 1% Monday. Hong cut her price target to $39, which is 5.6% below current levels, from $41. Analyst Jason English downgraded Procter & Gamble PG, +0.20%  to sell, citing concerns over valuation and the possibility that sales growth may have peaked. He expects sales weakness will be apparent in P&G’s fiscal second-quarter report, which is due out in late January. “Comparisons stiffen, efficacy of its U.S. promotional surge is in question given failure to translate into share gains and we see sustained market share vulnerability as it pursues its megabrand strategy in an environment of market fragmentation as barriers to entry shrink,” English wrote. He said the ratio of P&G’s stock price to earnings per share, which he said was at 21.6, was near the highest level in a decade, and is about 10% above its household and personal care peers. The stock, also a Dow component, shed 0.7% Monday. English slashed his stock-price target to $77, which is 8.8% below current levels, from $86. Coke’s stock has lost 0.5% over the past 12 months while P&G shares have gained 11.1%. In comparison, the Dow has run up 21.7% over the past year and the SPDR Consumer Staples Select Sector exchange-traded fund XLP, +0.06%  has tacked on 5.5%. Warren Buffett may disagree with Goldman Billionaire value investor Warren Buffett may beg to differ with Goldman’s take. The latest regulatory filings show that Berkshire Hathaway Inc. BRK.B, +0.30% BRK.A, -0.14%  was Coke’s largest shareholder, owning 400 million shares, or 9.3% of the shares outstanding as of Sept. 30, 2016. Berkshire also owns a relatively small 315,400-share stake in P&G. Buffett, a Trump critic, scores post-election profits (1:31) Warren Buffett was a big critic of Donald Trump during the presidential campaign. Now his Berkshire Hathaway is trading at all-time highs in the postelection Wall Street rally. The price declines in Coke and P&G shares suggest Buffett may be losing about $168.2 million on his investments. Berkshire is also a major shareholder of fellow Dow component Goldman GS, +0.19% with about 11 million shares, or 2.8% of the bank’s shares outstanding, as of Sept. 30, 2016. Goldman’s stock eased slid 0.8% Monday, which could be shaving about $22 million off Buffett’s investment.

Rich Smith (TMFDitty) Jan 9, 2017 at 1:29PM Donald Trump's inauguration as president later this month could mean good news for a lot of stocks -- just not for Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG). This, in a nutshell, is what Goldman Sachs had to say about Procter & Gamble stock this morning, downgrading the stock from neutral to sell, and cutting its price target by $9 -- or 10% -- from $86 to just $77. At today's share price of $84 and change, Goldman is therefore predicting that Procter & Gamble will give back most of last year's 11% gains over the course of 2017. Here are three more things you need to know. Goldman Sachs sees a long aisle ahead of Procter & Gamble, and no future for the stock. Image source: Getty Images. 1. "a relative laggard" As explained in a write-up on StreetInsider.com this morning, Goldman Sachs believes that Procter & Gamble stock is essentially a victim of its own success: "Given PG's size, we view needle-moving M&A as unlikely." Neither will the company benefit greatly from corporate tax cuts or new, beneficial rates on repatriation of foreign-earned income -- because P&G has a "relatively small international cash balance." But here's the most important reason Goldman thinks that Procter & Gamble stock will underperform this year, and calls it "a relative laggard": The stock simply costs too much. "In a still relatively rich sector," says Goldman, "PG stands out with its absolute P/E still near a decade high of 21.6x." This P/E ratio values Procter & Gamble roughly 10% higher than its competitors, while the stock's "EV/EBITDA multiple" of 15.4 sits 16% above "the 13.3x peer average." 2. But not the only laggard Goldman Sachs' condemnation of Procter & Gamble stock this morning was harsh -- but it wasn't the only stock the analyst called out for costing too much. Also marked down with a red pen was Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), which Goldman assigned a sell rating (and a $39 price target). Coke, says Goldman, faces significant headwinds from trying to sell dollar-denominated soda internationally, to a world that values the dollar too highly -- making Coke products even more expensive. The analyst warns that this will result in "sub-par" sales growth in 2017, and cause investors to value Coke's earnings at a lower price multiple -- perhaps 19 times earnings, rather than 20. The result, says Goldman, will be a $39 stock price at the end of this year, which implies a smaller-than-Procter potential loss of 6% on Coca-Cola stock -- but still a loss. 3. Something better So if not Procter & Gamble or Coke, what consumer goods stock does Goldman think you should buy this year? Believe it or not, Philip Morris International (NYSE:PM). While Goldman Sachs is no longer enthusiastic enough to keep Philip Morris stock on its conviction list, and in fact cut the stock from that list this morning, Goldman still rates Philip Morris International a buy. According to the analyst, 2017 could be the year that iQOS "Marlboro HeatSticks" will break out internationally, contributing perhaps 2.8% to Philip Morris' total sales. Goldman believes that Philip Morris stock, currently priced just over $91 a share, will hit $102 this year, resulting in a 12% profit -- 16.5% after including dividends. Final thing: Valuing the options Is Goldman Sachs right in preferring Philip Morris stock over Procter & Gamble and Coca-Cola? Valued on trailing earnings (and forward earnings as well, for that matter), Philip Morris is clearly the cheapest of the three stocks. Its 22 P/E ratio is 9% cheaper than Procter & Gamble's 24 P/E, and 13% cheaper than Coke at 25.3. Additionally, analysts estimate that Philip Morris will grow earnings nearly as fast as Procter & Gamble over the next five years -- 7.8% versus 8% -- and several times faster than Coke's projected 1.8% long-term growth rate. Additionally, Philip Morris' 4.5% dividend yield is higher than what Coke (3.4%) and Procter & Gamble (3.2%) pay. Personally, I still don't think Philip Morris' total expected return (growth rate, plus dividend yield) of 12.3% justifies the 22 P/E ratio. But Goldman Sachs does have at least one point right: Relative to Procter & Gamble and Coca-Cola stock, Philip Morris is the cheapest stock of the three. If investing in big, international blue chips is your thing, it's probably the best option available right now.

  Home U.K. News Sports U.S. Showbiz Australia Femail Health Science Money Video Travel Columnists Wires Home My Profile Logout Login Feedback DailyMail NEW ARTICLESHomeTop Share show ad US STOCKS-Wall St set for lower open, with Dow staying adrift of 20,000 By Reuters Published: 09:14 EST, 9 January 2017 | Updated: 09:14 EST, 9 January 2017 e-mail By Yashaswini Swamynathan Jan 9 (Reuters) - Wall Street was set to open slightly lower on Monday as oil prices slipped, while a drop in P&G and Coca-Cola could keep the Dow Jones Industrial Average from hitting the historic 20,000 mark. P&G and Coke were down 1.2 percent after Goldman Sachs downgraded both the consumer staple stocks. Dow e-minis were down 48 points, or 0.24 percent, with 18,608 contracts changing hands. S&P 500 e-minis were down 3.25 points, or 0.14 percent, with 88,660 contracts traded. Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 1.5 points, or 0.03 percent, on volume of 17,200 contracts. The Dow hit a record 19,999.63 points on Friday, while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq also hit all-time highs, after a late pop in Apple and other technology stocks. Wall Street has rallied since Donald Trump won the U.S. election in November as investors bet he will introduce business-friendly policies. But the rally has led to lofty valuations - the S&P is trading at about 17 times expected earnings, compared to its 10-year average of 14. That could make investors cautious as they gear up for the fourth-quarter earnings season. "The market is building drama around 20,000 and if and when we get promising earnings reports, the Dow will go through the point like a hot knife through butter," said Andre Bakhos, managing director at Janlyn Capital in Bernardsville, New Jersey. The first peek into how companies fared last quarter will be provided later this week by big U.S. banks, including JPMorgan , Bank of America and Wells Fargo. S&P 500 companies overall are expected to post a 6.1 percent increase in profit in the quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Oil prices fell more than 2 percent on Monday as signs of growing U.S. production outweighed optimism that other producers were sticking to a deal to cut supply to bolster prices. Boston Federal Reserve President Eric Rosengren on Monday called for the U.S. central bank to step up its pace of interest-rate hikes, warning of inflation risks if it did not. Among stocks, Dow component UnitedHealth slipped 0.5 percent to $161.58 premarket after its Optum unit said it would buy Surgical Care Affiliates Inc for about $2.30 billion. Surgical Care's stock was up 15 percent. VCA Inc, which runs hospitals for animals, soared nearly 29 percent to $91 premarket after Mars Inc said it would buy the company for $7.7 billion. DaVita's shares lost 4.7 percent to $62.7 after the company and Germany's Fresenius Medical said they got subpoenas from federal prosecutors relating to a charity that helps patients pay for kidney dialysis. Healthcare stocks will be in focus for the day as a number of companies present at J.P. Morgan's healthcare conference.

Kriel, Julia Mehalick Marek, Theresa Ann Minichello, Marc E. By Bob Kalinowski (Staff Writer) / Published: October 13, 2011 Article Tools Font size – + Share This     The Larksville man charged by the FBI in a food contamination plot repeatedly injected his semen into the lunches of female co-workers, authorities confirmed Wednesday. Authorities said Joseph Bartorillo secretly injected semen into yogurt two female co-workers brought for lunch at the Procter & Gamble paper products facility in Wyoming County. Details continued to emerge Wednesday in the case that came to light Tuesday when federal prosecutors announced the 60-year-old was facing food tampering charges in the semen-spreading plot. Wyoming County District Attorney Jeff Mitchell vowed Bartorillo would face more charges on the state level. "I have never seen a situation like this before," Mitchell said. "It's definitely very unique." Mitchell detailed how investigators became aware of the crime, but wouldn't specify what led them to Bartorillo, a veteran employee who is married and has no criminal history. "The victims began to notice something was wrong with their yogurts - there were pin marks," Mitchell explained, noting the yogurt also smelled and tasted bad. Mitchell said the victims knew something was wrong, but didn't know what. Authorities are still trying to determine a motive for the crime, which occurred at least 13 times between July 2010 and May of this year, the district attorney said. Mitchell stressed that no Procter and Gamble products were contaminated. Alex Fried, spokesman at Procter and Gamble's plant in Washington Township, said Bartorillo is no longer an employee. "The situation he was involved in did not involve any product we make or sell," Fried said. The plant employs about 2,200 people, he said. "As soon as we were made aware of this, we investigated. We sought the assistance of law enforcement because the safety of our employees is of utmost concern," Fried said. "Law enforcement authorities determined it happened outside of production area, plus we have a robust quality assurance system to ensure high quality and supervision of our products." Fried also wouldn't say how Bartorillo was caught. In a news release Tuesday, U.S. Attorney Peter Smith noted that all of the tainted containers were recovered and the public was not in danger. Court documents filed in the case indicate Bartorillo reached a plea deal with prosecutors that calls for a two-year federal prison sentence. "He's cooperated with them for well over two months, and there is an agreement worked out - the details I can't get into yet," said Bartorillo's attorney Demetrius Fannick. "I can tell you it was a confined incident. There is no danger to the public. He's doing what he's supposed to be doing right now (by cooperating)." A judge could reject Bartorillo's plea with federal officials and sentence him up to 10 years in federal prison, court documents say. Bartorillo's federal charges deal mainly with the business side of the crime, while the state charges will be for the actions against the victims, Mitchell said. A vehicle was in the driveway at Bartorillo's home in Larksville on Wednesday, but no one answered the door. bkalinowski@citizensvoice.com, 570-821-2055 We welcome user discussion on our site, under the following guidelines: To comment you must first create a profile and sign-in with a verified DISQUS account or social network ID.

These stocks are what you're looking for. Dan Caplinger, Neha Chamaria, and Daniel Miller (TMFGalagan) Jan 8, 2017 at 8:02AM Investing in stocks involves risk, but smart investors manage that risk to identify stocks that have strong return potential with minimal chances of potential losses. That balance can result in market-beating returns over the long run without the same volatility you'll see in the overall market. Let's learn why Ford (NYSE:F), Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), and Consolidated Edison (NYSE:ED) deserve a closer look to see if they belong in your portfolio. Image source: Ford. Rev up your engines with Ford Dan Caplinger (Ford): One way to find top stocks with low risk is to look for companies that have solid prospects but that have had their share prices beaten down. Ford is a good example, with the automaker having gone through some recent challenges that have caused a dramatic downdraft for the stock over the past couple of years. Auto sales remain strong overall, but Ford has seen some difficulties with demand for some of its U.S. models, including the key F-150 pickup truck. In October, Ford had to idle four plants briefly in order to let demand catch up to inventory, and some worry that overall industry sales figures will have to fall from their recent heights in the years to come. For Ford investors, however, the stock already incorporates a great deal of that downbeat view. Shares currently trade at just seven times trailing earnings, and even though analysts expect somewhat of an earnings pullback for 2017, they don't see any threat to single-digit forward earnings multiples for the foreseeable future. That's a margin of safety you just won't find in many places in the stock market right now. With the potential to surprise on the upside with unexpected gains if sales don't deteriorate, Ford has a lot going for it right now. A leaner and meaner company Daniel Miller (Procter & Gamble): It's very likely you're aware of Procter & Gamble. After all, it's one of the world's largest consumer product manufacturers with a slew of household names, including Tide laundry detergent, Gillette razors, Charmin toilet paper, Pantene Shampoo, just to name a few. In fact P&G owns 22 brands that generate more than $1 billion in annual sales. If you're looking for a stable company with a long list of products that are necessities, this is a one-stop shop for investors looking for little to no risk. The good news for investors is that P&G is putting the finishing touches on slimming down its portfolio of products after entering too many markets in too many categories too quickly. It trimmed roughly 70% of its brands, now with only 65 of its best and most proven brands and reduced the categories it participates in by 60%. The strategy has been that as the company sheds under performing brands in more competitive categories its top-line growth would return. That was the case in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 as its total organic sales checked in at 3% with increases in 9 out of its 10 largest markets. Another reason that makes P&G much less risky than many stocks is its dedication to returning massive value to shareholders through dividends and buybacks. During fiscal 2016 P&G returned $15.6 billion to shareholders, and it expects that to reach $22 billion during fiscal 2017, and up to a staggering $70 billion between fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2019. On top of that, management believes it can generate $10 billion in productivity savings between fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2021. P&G is leaner and meaner than it has been in recent years, and its focus on trimming brands and costs will ensure that its top and bottom line will continue improving in the near-term, and its focus on returning huge sums of capital to shareholders makes this one of the lowest risk investments in the market.  A defensive stock to suit your risk profile Neha Chamaria (Consolidated Edison): If you have a low appetite for risk, your best bet would be a defensive stock that can make you money regardless of the business cycle. One way to find such a stock is to look for companies that provide essentials, the demand for which doesn't ebb and flow with the economy. Utilities like Consolidated Edison is a perfect example. Having been around for almost two centuries now, Con Ed provides electricity and gas to more than ten million people in New York City and Westchester County. As the industry is highly regulated and has strong barriers to entry, Con Ed doesn't have to worry much about competition. To top that, Con Ed's rates are decoupled, which means its revenues are predetermined and don't depend on sales volumes. That's undoubtedly a huge advantage as it eliminates much of the uncertainty associated with profits and operating cash flows. For Con Ed investors, that has translated into 42 consecutive years of dividend increases. In short, two factors make Con Ed a low-risk stock: A stable, non-cyclical business and solid shareholder returns. If you're worried a regulated business might mean muted earnings growth, you can take heart in Con Ed's ongoing efforts to tap growth opportunities in non-utility and renewables, including battery storage, electric vehicles, solar, and wind. I believe this diversification should not only help Con Ed expand its customer base but also push its earnings higher in the years to come. Overall, Con Ed is the kind of stock that will let you sleep at night while it fills your coffers. Psst...the stock's dividend yield has consistently kept its head above the 3% mark in the past decade.  Dan Caplinger owns shares of Ford. Daniel Miller owns shares of Ford.

The company owns Banfield Pet Hospital and BluePearl Veterinary Partners, and it’s acquired pet-food brands from Procter & Gamble Co. VCA Advertisement Candy giant Mars Inc., facing a slowdown in packaged food, is making a bigger bet on a booming industry: pet care. The maker of M&Ms and Snickers agreed to buy the animal-hospital chain VCA Inc. for about $7.7 billion on January 9 -- not including debt -- expanding on its existing veterinary-care business. Mars will pay $93 a share in cash, a 31% premium to VCA’s closing price of $70.77 on January 6. The acquisition turns Mars into a dominant company in corporate-owned pet hospitals, an area that’s exploded in recent years -- helped by Americans treating their pets more like family members. It also could help bolster Mars’s current pet brands, including Pedigree and Whiskas. Popular Now Dyson Hire From Tesla Stokes Electric Car Expectations Top 10 Manufacturing Countries in 2020 Top 25 Supply Chains of 2015 At a time when human food isn’t growing as quickly, the deal may make more sense for Mars than buying another snack business, said Ken Shea, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “They see growth and they see diversity,” he said. “Why double down on food when it’s not growing that fast?” The total value for the deal is about $9.1 billion, including $1.4 billion in outstanding debt. Shares of VCA, which trade under the ticker WOOF, surged as much as 29% to $91.03 on January 9 after the transaction was announced. Closely held Mars had already been building out its pet business, including both food and hospital care. The company owns Banfield Pet Hospital and BluePearl Veterinary Partners, and it’s acquired pet-food brands from Procter & Gamble Co. VCA, meanwhile, operates almost 800 animal hospitals in the U.S. and Canada. Grocery Slowdown The deeper push into the pet business by Mars comes as large packaged-food companies are struggling with flagging sales. Changing consumer tastes, particularly a desire for less processed foods, has made it difficult for the companies that have dominated grocery-store shelves. Efforts to reduce sugar intake have struck an additional blow to candy makers such as Mars. That’s added pressure to diversify their portfolios. Spending on pets has surged in the U.S., fueled by the “humanization” of dogs and cats. Americans spent $35 billion on veterinary care in 2015. VCA, a pioneer in the field, has grown by buying up hundreds of veterinary hospitals -- an approach that’s now being adopted by rival companies. Mars, based in McLean, Va., expects the VCA deal to be completed in the third quarter. “VCA is a leader across pet health care and the opportunity we see together -- for pets, pet owners, veterinarians and other pet-care providers -- is tremendous,” Mars CEO Grant Reid said.

Two-thirds of the 30 Dow components were lower, with Goldman Sachs's 0.7 percent decline weighing the most. P&G and Coca-Cola dropped 0.9 percent after Goldman downgraded both the consumer staple stocks. Eight of the 11 major S&P sectors were lower, led by the energy sector's 1.3 percent drop. Oil prices fell 2.5 percent on concerns that rising U.S. output could dampen the impact of a recent deal among major producers to limit output. The declines meant the Dow stayed shy of the psychologically significant 20,000 mark. It came tantalizingly close on Friday, hitting a record of 19,999.63, as the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq also touched records after a late pop in tech stocks. "Our view about the Dow (hitting) 20,000 is not a matter of if, but a matter of when," said Matt Jones, U.S. head of equity strategy at J.P. Morgan Private Bank in New York. At 11:08 a.m. ET (1608 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 26.53 points, or 0.13 percent, at 19,937.27. The S&P 500 was down 2.48 points, or 0.11 percent, at 2,274.5 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 10.27 points, or 0.19 percent, at 5,531.32. The Nasdaq hit a high of 5,538.295. The tech sector was the top gainer. Apple , which is celebrating the tenth anniversary of the iPhone, was up 1.1 percent at $119.14, after hitting a 13-month high of $119.30. "As we move into the next couple of weeks, the focus will move towards the micro and to specific company earnings and expectation going forward," Jones said. The first peek into how companies fared will be provided later this week by big U.S. banks. S&P 500 companies overall are expected to post a 6.1 percent increase in profit in the quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. A string of multi-billion dollar healthcare deals boost the sector on Monday. Ariad Pharma surged nearly 73 percent on a $5.20 billion buyout deal with Japan's Takeda. Pet hospital operator VCA jumped 28 percent after Mars Inc said it would buy the company for $7.7 billion. Surgical Care Affiliates jumped 16 percent on a deal to be bought by UnitedHealth for about $2.30 billion. Dow component UnitedHealth dipped 0.6 percent. Acuity Brands fell 12.3 percent to $207.51 after the lighting solutions provider gave a disappointing sales forecast. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,667 to 1,167. On the Nasdaq, 1,562 issues fell and 1,149 advanced. The S&P 500 index showed five new 52-week highs and no new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 37 new highs and 11 new lows.

Publicis Groupe Leo Burnett has hired Publicis Groupe veteran, consultant and venture capitalist Andrew Swinand to serve as its North American chief executive officer. Swinand, who spent more than a decade in leadership positions at Publicis media agency Starcom MediaVest Group, succeeds Rich Stoddart, who has simultaneously served as global and North American chief executive at Leo Burnett since his promotion last January. In an internal memo sent to all staff on Sunday, Publicis Worldwide CEO Arthur Sadoun called Swinand "a truly respected and thoughtful leader and a familiar face to many of us within Publicis Groupe," adding, "I truly believe in his ability to drive this transformation in North America for one of our biggest operations." The incoming chief executive ran P&G's Secret account at Starcom and later became president of that agency's Chicago office after working as an account supervisor at BBDO and an in-house brand manager with P&G. In hiring Swinand, Leo Burnett also acquired his two most recent businesses: analytics software maker Ardent IO and startup incubator The Abundancy. According to Sadoun's memo, these two companies will act as natural partners in helping Publicis develop data-based "custom content" for its clients. Sixty employees from the two organizations will also become Leo Burnett Chicago staffers later this month. "The challenge every brand faces is to get chosen. Thanks to our technology, it's possible to predict what people want so that brands can respond with experiences that are truly meaningful," said Swinand in a statement. "By combining our data-driven insights with Leo Burnett's award-winning creative capabilities, we will make Leo Burnett's HumanKind approach more powerful than ever before in helping our clients." Swinand will report to Publicis Communications North American CEO Andrew Bruce while working closely with Stoddart (who will retain the title of global chief) and Judy John, who serves as both CEO of Leo Burnett Canada and chief creative officer of the larger North American organization. Publicis looks to make 2017 a rebound year for Leo Burnett after its North American network lost the nearly $1 billion McDonald's account to Omnicom last August. Longtime client General Motors also put its GMC brand into review the following month after the Detroit offices of Burnett and DigitasLBi merged, forming the "Engage M-1" unit in order to more effectively serve the client. Leo Burnett will continue to partner with GM as Buick's agency of record even if it does not win the GMC review, though it did recently part with the chief creative officer who had been overseeing all global General Motors work since 2013. In the memo, Sadoun positioned Swinand's hire as evidence of Publicis Groupe's efforts to "reinforce" the Leo Burnett organization while doubling down on its "Power of One" strategy. This consolidation-heavy approach has recently helped the holding company score new business in North America with USAA, Walmart and MillerCoors; the latter two wins occurred without a formal agency review process.

Publicis looks to make 2017 a rebound year for Leo Burnett after its North American network lost the nearly $1 billion McDonald's account to Omnicom last August. Longtime client General Motors also put its GMC brand into review the following month after the Detroit offices of Burnett and DigitasLBi merged, forming the "Engage M-1" unit in order to more effectively serve the client. Leo Burnett will continue to partner with GM as Buick's agency of record even if it does not win the GMC review, though it did recently part with the chief creative officer who had been overseeing all global General Motors work since 2013. In the memo, Sadoun positioned Swinand's hire as evidence of Publicis Groupe's efforts to "reinforce" the Leo Burnett organization while doubling down on its "Power of One" strategy. This consolidation-heavy approach has recently helped the holding company score new business in North America with USAA, Walmart and MillerCoors; the latter two wins occurred without a formal agency review process.

Continue Reading Below The energy sector dropped 1.4 percent as oil prices slid on concerns that rising Iraqi exports and U.S. output could dampen the impact of a deal among major producers to limit output. Two-thirds of the 30 Dow components were lower, with Exxon Mobil's 2.1 percent decline weighing the most, followed by a 1.3 percent drop in Chevron. The declines meant the Dow stayed shy of the psychologically significant 20,000 mark. It came tantalizingly close on Friday, hitting a record of 19,999.63, as the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq also touched records after a late pop in tech stocks. "Our view about the Dow (hitting) 20,000 is not a matter of if, but a matter of when," said Matt Jones, U.S. head of equity strategy at J.P. Morgan Private Bank in New York. At 12:28 p.m. ET (1728 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 48.65 points, or 0.24 percent, at 19,915.15, the S&P 500 was down 3.53 points, or 0.15 percent, at 2,273.45. Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT The Nasdaq Composite was up 17.96 points, or 0.33 percent, at 5,539.01, easing slightly after hitting an all-time high of 5,539.14. Eight of the 11 major S&P sectors were lower. The tech sector was the top gainer. Apple , celebrating the tenth anniversary of the iPhone, rose 1.3 percent to a 13-month high of $119.43. "As we move into the next couple of weeks, the focus will move towards the micro and to specific company earnings and expectation going forward," Jones said. The first peek into how companies fared in the previous quarter will be provided later this week by big banks. S&P 500 companies overall are expected to post a 5.8 percent increase in profit in the quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The financial sector was however off 0.34 percent on Monday. Other big-name decliners were P&G and Coca-Cola , which dropped about 1 percent each after Goldman downgraded the stocks to "sell". The healthcare sector gained 0.34 percent, boosted by a string of multi-billion dollar deals. Pet hospital operator VCA jumped 28 percent after agreeing to a $7.7 billion buyout offer from candy and pet foods maker Mars Inc. Ariad Pharma surged nearly 73 percent on a $5.20 billion buyout deal with Japan's Takeda. Surgical Care Affiliates jumped 16 percent on a deal to be bought by UnitedHealth for about $2.30 billion. Dow component UnitedHealth dipped 0.6 percent. One dim spot in the sector was Celgene, which lost 1.1 percent after issuing a full-year revenue forecast that missed analysts' expectations. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,604 to 1,276. On the Nasdaq, 1,498 issues fell and 1,294 advanced. The S&P 500 index showed five new 52-week highs and no new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 47 new highs and 14 new lows.

The amendment to the city's Brownfield Plan calls for demolition to be completed by the end of 2017. The demolition activities, including abatement of such hazards as asbestos and lead, will be eligible for about $9 million in Brownfield reimbursements. A public hearing on the amendment to the plan will be held during the city commission meeting at 5:30 p.m. Tuesday, Jan. 10. Following the hearing, the commission will vote on the plan, which spells out development obligations for the building known as The Watermark. $33 million indoor entertainment, apartments announced for Shaw Walker building The commission also will vote on a Neighborhood Enterprise Zone certificate that would freeze taxes on new apartments at The Watermark for 15 years. Owner P & G Holdings of New York plans to develop 120 new market-rate apartments. A portion of the complex has already been developed into housing units, an event center and coffee shop. P & G spelled out plans, costing at least $30 million in private investment, for much of the remaining complex, which include: Laser tag, a restaurant with bakery, a bowling alley and a bar with an open two-story ceiling on the first floor that measures nearly 58,000 square feet. Laser tag, mountain biking and go-kart tracks on the nearly 58,000-square-foot second floor. Mountain biking and large spaces for yet-to-be announced commercial and retail tenants on the 59,600-square-foot third floor. Mountain biking, concert venue and trampoline park on the fourth floor that would feature two-story ceilings. That floor also is about 59,600 square feet. A canopied venue with prep area and large L-shaped roof deck on the roof. Plans for the oldest section of the complex on the corner of West Western Avenue and Division Street remain unclear. The owner is rethinking original plans to demolish the structure because of its historic nature, said Muskegon City Manager Frank Peterson. The agreement with Muskegon's Brownfield Authority calls for the owner to put $150,000 into an escrow account to pay for demolition of that part of the complex. It also requires the owner to provide notice of any rehabilitation plans for the building or to demolish it within two years. "The question is is there an end user for it, and how much is it going to cost?" Peterson said. P & G has estimated that about $9 million in work - including extensive interior demolition and abatement - will qualify for reimbursement from the Brownfield Authority. The reimbursements, paid through tax capture, would begin in 2018 and continue for an estimated 30 years. At least 125 new jobs, averaging a wage of $10 per hour, will be created by the project as well as at least 85 temporary construction jobs, according to the Brownfield plan. The NEZ certificate on the new apartments would freeze property taxes at their current rate for 15 years, after which they would be levied at 25 percent for the 16th year, 50 percent the 17th year and 75 percent the 18th year. P & G Holdings purchased the former Shaw-Walker complex for $1.75 million in 2001.Renovations began in 2004 and to date have totaled $12 million, officials said. The completed portion of the development, with modern architecture and fresh clean lines fronts less visible Washington Avenue and Hudson streets.   Detroit Auto Show Relive top vehicle unveilings 2017 Detroit auto show unique technology and oddities The most overlooked vehicles at the Detroit auto show Technology steals show, but is 'mobility fatigue' setting in?

REUTERS/Lucas Jackson 1/2 left right A trader works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) shortly after the opening bell in New York, U.S., January 9, 2017. REUTERS/Lucas Jackson 2/2 By Sinead Carew Declines in energy and financial stocks weighed on the S&P 500 on Monday and helped stall the Dow's pursuit of the 20,000 milestone ahead of earnings season and expected U.S. policy changes under the Donald Trump presidency. The Nasdaq notched a record high close, extending its bullish run with help from healthcare stocks. The S&P's energy sector .SPNY dropped 1.5 percent as oil prices slid on concerns that rising Iraqi exports and U.S. output could dampen the impact of a deal among major producers to limit output. Elsewhere, investors were taking a breather ahead of fourth-quarter earnings and the Jan. 20 presidential inauguration. The S&P 500 benchmark has risen more than 6 percent since the Nov. 8 election of Donald Trump, who has pledged tax cuts, lighter regulation and fiscal stimulus, but investors are now waiting to see if he can deliver on those promises. "People are waiting for more information. We're waiting for political news, we're waiting for earnings. There's a lot of uncertainty out there. As the month goes on I expect we'll see some movement," said Peter Jankovskis, co-chief investment officer at OakBrook Investments LLC in Lisle, Illinois. The financial sector .SPSY fell 0.8 percent on Monday. It had risen almost 18 percent since the election, led by banking stocks. Big banks will provide the first peek into how U.S. companies fared in the fourth quarter later this week. S&P 500 companies overall are expected to post a 5.8 percent increase in profit in the quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. "There is some hope we'll see some movement upward. Investors want to see some of those reports come out first," said Jankovskis. Two-thirds of the 30 Dow Jones Industrial Average components fell, keeping the psychologically significant 20,000 mark at bay. Goldman Sachs' (GS.N) 0.8 percent fall was its biggest drag followed by International Business Machine's (IBM.N) 0.9 percent drop and Exxon Mobil's (XOM.N) 1.7 percent decline. The Dow had come tantalizingly close to the milestone on Friday, hitting a peak of 19,999.63, as the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq also touched records after a late pop in tech stocks. "Our view about the Dow (hitting) 20,000 is not a matter of if, but a matter of when," said Matt Jones, U.S. head of equity strategy at J.P. Morgan Private Bank in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI was down 76.42 points, or 0.38 percent, to 19,887.38, the S&P 500 .SPX had lost 8.08 points, or 0.354856 percent, to 2,268.9 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC had added 10.76 points, or 0.19 percent, to 5,531.82. Eight of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were lower. The S&P's health sector .SPXHC was the biggest gainer with Merck & Co. <MRK. N> the leading boost and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX.O) the biggest percentage gainer with a 4.4 pct jump after it issued guidance. Nasdaq's biggest drivers in the healthcare sector were Ariad Pharmaceuticals (ARIA.O), which closed up 72.9 percent on a $5.20 billion buyout deal with Japan's Takeda 4502.T Incyte (INCY.O) with a 9.4 percent jump after it announced advancements in its cancer drug program with Merck. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.77-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.45-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 6 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 55 new highs and 16 new lows. About 6.4 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges on Monday compared with the 6.6 billion average for the last 20 sessions.

The FTSE Index rose 27.72 points to an all-time closing high of 7,237.77, as the market continued to benefit from the pound's slump. It marks the longest record closing streak since the beginning of May 1997, putting the London market on course for its longest ever record closing streak if it reaches an all-time closing high on Tuesday. Theresa May said she does not accept the terms hard and soft Brexit, while Angela Merkel says the UK may not be allowed access the Single Market The further push into record territory came during a remarkable rally on Monday, with the top-flight delivering a new mid-session record of 7,243.76 after investors snapped up stocks on the back of the pound's plunge to a two-month low against the US dollar. Sterling was under severe pressure on the currency markets following an interview with Theresa May on Sunday, in which she stated the importance of taking control of immigration over access to the European single market. The pound hit lows not seen since last October, dropping 0.9 per cent versus the greenback at 1.21 and falling 1.3 per cent against the euro at 1.151.

'The bulls are out in force and there¿s no stopping the FTSE... Share this article Share Sterling's lows remained entrenched despite Mrs May moving to clarify her comments, telling a London press conference: 'I'm tempted to say that the people who are getting it wrong are those who print things saying I am talking about a hard Brexit (and that) it's absolutely inevitable there's a hard Brexit. 'I don't accept the terms hard and soft Brexit.' The UK currency's fall since the Brexit vote has proved beneficial for multinational companies listed on the index, as many tend to benefit from earnings in currencies - such as the US dollar - which are performing more strongly than sterling. Across Europe, Germany's Dax was down 0.5 per cent and the Cac 40 in France slipped 0.3 per cent. On the oil markets, the price of Brent crude slipped amid concerns over growing US production and the Opec cartel's ability to drive through cuts to support prices. The price of oil was down three per cent - or one dollar and 71 cents - to 55.39 US dollars a barrel In UK stocks, London-listed miner Glencore was sitting at the top of the biggest risers after a positive note from Barclays on the outlook for the mining industry. Shares were up more than three per cent, or 10.3p to 298.7p, after the bank said that an ongoing infrastructure spending splurge from China, coupled with potential fiscal stimulus from Western countries, made the sector's valuation look reasonable. Lloyds Banking Group was among the biggest fallers, dropping 0.7p to 65.2p, after the Government reduced its stake in the lender to less than six per cent, meaning the taxpayer is no longer the group's largest shareholder Away from the top tier, betting giant William Hill was nursing hefty losses after warning that profits would suffer a £20million hit following a string of 'customer-friendly' results in December. The high street bookmaker said full-year operating profit for 2016 would come in at around £260 million, the bottom end of its £260million-£280million range. Shares were down more than two per cent, or 6.1p to 291.6p, on the FTSE 250 index. The biggest risers on the FTSE 100 Index were Glencore up 10.3p to 298.7p, Randgold Resources up 145p to 6,660p, British American Tobacco up 101p to 4,675p, Imperial Brands up 78p to 3,616.5p. The biggest fallers on the FTSE 100 Index were Capita down 15p to 500.5p, Land Securities down 23p to 1,034p, Royal Bank of Scotland down 5p to 227.4p, Whitbread down 76p to 3,865p. 15:30: The Footsie was cruising towards another record close, despite US stocks opening up lower at the start of the earnings season on Wall Street. With an hour to go the FTSE 100 index was up 14.2 points at 7,224.2, slightly lower than it had been at lunch. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 60 points at the bell, with Goldman Sachs contributing the most losses. Proctor & Gamble and Coke were also down after downgrades from analysts. The Dow had hit a record close on Friday, while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq also clocked up all-time highs following a late rise in Apple and other technology stocks. Wall Street has rallied since Donald Trump won the US election in November as investors bet he will introduce business-friendly policies. But the rally has led to lofty valuations - with the S&P is trading at about 17 times expected earnings, compared to its average of 14.  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 2 Next MIDAS SHARE TIPS UPDATE: Bumper year projected for Cineworld... British factories 'on the mend' as weak pound has made UK... 'The bulls are out in force and there¿s no stopping the FTSE... Share this article Share That could make investors cautious as they gear up for the fourth-quarter earnings season.  The first peek into how companies fared last quarter will be provided later this week by big US banks, including JPMorgan , Bank of America and Wells Fargo. S&P 500 companies overall are expected to post a 6.1 percent increase in profit in the quarter, according to Reuters. Bank stocks were among the biggest losers this session Michael Hewson, analyst at CMC Markets, said: 'After stalling within a whisker of 20k on Friday the Dow opened slightly lower today as investors mulled over whether further gains in US markets are sustainable in the longer term. 'There is also the fact that we will get to see some important earnings announcements later this week from the main US banks, and if these disappoint we could well see some profit taking start to kick in, particularly given that we've seen big gains in this sector in the last six months, with JP Morgan up 37 per cent, Bank of America up 69 per cent and Wells Fargo up 13 per cent, with a good proportion of those gains since November 8th.' Back in London it has been a poor session for bank stocks, with Royal Bank of Scotland rooted to the bottom of the leaderboard. Its shares are off 2.8 per cent, or 6.6p, at 225.7p.  Lloyds is also down 1.8 per cent, or 1.2p, at 1,036.5p, despite the Government selling another stake in the bank. Michael Hewson, at CMC Markets, explained: 'Banking stocks have also slipped back a touch with Lloyds Banking Group lower after the government sold off another part of its stake in the bank, taking it below 6 per cent, and bringing ever closer the day the bank is completely back in the private sector.  'This morning's further sales also serves to highlight the contrast to Royal Bank of Scotland, whose problems still remain very much front and centre given it still has to arrive at a settlement with the US Department of Justice over mortgage backed securities mis-selling. 'The weakness in banking stocks may also be down to a slight softening in yields and a narrowing of interest rate differentials between short and long term debt on government debt markets.' But the major story this session has been the pound's dramatic fall over comments Prime Minister Theresa May made yesterday Brexit. This afternoon May tried to clarify the Government's position on Hard or Soft Brexit. She said: 'I'm tempted to say that the people who are getting it wrong are those who print things saying I'm talking about a hard Brexit, (that) it is absolutely inevitable there's a hard Brexit. 'I don't accept the terms hard and soft Brexit. What we're doing is going to get an ambitious, good and best possible deal for the United Kingdom in terms of... trading with and operating within the single European market.'  At the same time German Chancellor Angela Merkel has also waded in stating that if the UK does not accept the EU's 'four freedoms' in Brexit negotiations, attention will need to turn to restricting Britain's access to the single market. 13:00: The Footsie remained in comfortable territory at lunch, driven higher by internationally focused stocks following a sharp fall in the pound.  The FTSE 100 index was up 21.7 points at 7,232.7, on course for its eighth straight record close. Mark Ward at Sanlam Securities UK said: 'The FTSE is still currency-led, with Brexit uncertainty over the weekend grinding it higher. I don't think these markets will go lower anytime soon.' On the up: Glencore was the biggest gainer after positive comments from Barclays on the outlook for the mining industry As a result stocks with a large proportion of overseas earnings rose to the top of the FTSE 100, led by miners. Glencore was the biggest gainer after positive comments from Barclays on the outlook for the mining industry.  Shares were up more than 2 per cent, or 6.7p to 295.2p, after the bank said that China's ongoing infrastructure spending splurge, coupled with potential fiscal stimulus from Western countries, made the sector's valuation look reasonable. Anglo American lifted 2 per cent at 1,154.5p and BHP Billiton added 1.5 per cent to 1,334.5p. Tobacco stocks also rose, led by British American Tobacco, up 1.4 per cent at 4,639.5p, and Imperial Brands up 1.2 per cent higher at 3,593.0p. On the FTSE 250 Ashmore was the biggest faller, down 6.7 per cent at 279.2p after analysts at Barclays said the emerging markets-focused fund manager was vulnerable to outflows following Donald Trump's election as US president. William Hill was another heavy faller, down 3.8 per cent at 286.4p after the bookmaker said profits would fall to £260million for the year, down from £291.4million last year, after a number of horse racing and football results went against it. But the session has been dominated by sterling's collapse following hints from Prime Minister Theresa May that Britain may opt for a so-called 'hard Brexit'.  Sterling plunged to a two-month low against the US dollar - dropping 1.2 per cent to $1.214 - in response to an interview with May on Sunday, in which she stated that importance would be given to gaining full control over immigration during divorce negotiations with the European Union. The pound was also down 0.9 per cent versus the euro at €1.154. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said the markets were reading May's comments as a move towards leaving the European single market in favour of World Trade Organisation rules. Naeem Aslam, analyst at ThinkMarkets added: 'The political crisis is brewing and you can see that when you look at pound. The UK government is playing with fire and creating more uncertainty. Last year, we said that the British pound has tendency of touching the mark of 1.18 against the dollar and we are still maintaining our call.' 'The government needs to be consistent with their message so that market can digest all the bad news and move on with it.'.  The pound has dropped around 18 per cent against the US dollar and 10 per cent versus the euro since the June 23 vote, as traders expect the British economy to be significantly weaker once it quits the EU.  On the oil markets, the price of Brent crude slid 1.7 per cent - or 97 cents - to $56.13 a barrel, as traders became concerned about the Opec cartel's ability to drive through production cuts.   08:20: The Footsie was quick off the block on Monday morning, jumping higher after a strong session overnight in Asia. In opening deals the FTSE 100 index was up 21.6 points at 7,232.5 - a fresh intraday high. On Friday it closed up 14.74 points at 7210.05 - yet another record finish for the buoyant London market.   The Santa rally from December has continued into January, driven by what is expected to be a new era for US politics and European politics in 2017. Issue: UK equity markets have been flying but the pound remains worryingly weak Overnight the Hang Seng in Hong Kong was marginally up and the Shanghai Composite rose by 0.4 per cent. South Korea's Kospi edged higher by 0.2 per cent, while Australia's ASX/200 finished 0.9 per cent up.  But the pound is feeling the pain as stocks rise. Already this morning it has dropped by 0.8 per cent against both the dollar and the euro following Theresa May's Sky News interview at the weekend.  In her first major interview of 2017, May told Sky News that: 'Often people talk in terms as if somehow we are leaving the EU but we still want to kind of keep bits of membership of the EU. We are leaving. We are coming out. We are not going to be a member of the EU any longer.' The Prime Minister's comments were read as falling decidedly on the 'hard' end of the Brexit spectrum, with 'control of borders' likely to be prioritised over continued access to the single market. This left sterling at a two-month low against both the dollar and the euro.  The pound is likely to drop around 5 per cent to $1.15 against the dollar after May triggers Article 50 in March, starting the two-year countdown to leaving the EU, according to a Reuters poll of more than 60 foreign exchange strategists In the UK, the week ahead will be dominated by Christmas trading updates from the country's largest retailers. Analysts anticipate that results will be mixed.  In focus today will be UK Halifax House Price data which is seen holding its ground to the benefit of the housebuilders which already got a boost past week from Persimmon's positive trading update and several broker upgrades.  Elsewhere global oil prices fell as increased exports from Iran undermined efforts by other oil producers to curb a global fuel supply overhang.   Stocks in focus in London include:   LLOYDS BANKING - Britain has cut its stake in the bank to below 6 per cent as it attempts to return the lender to full private ownership this year. BOVIS HOMES - Boss chief executive David Ritchie had stepped down with immediate effect, days after it warned on profit because it failed to complete the number of homes it expected at the end of 2016.     UK SUPERMARKET OPERATORS - Britain's three quoted major supermarkets are expected to report this week that they enjoyed solid Christmas trading, though investor concern about a potential squeeze on consumer spending in 2017 means the focus is on their outlooks.   Data:  Germany industrial production at 7am Halifax House Price Index at 8.30am Eurozone unemployment at 10am Share or comment on this article e-mail 10 shares Fly to New York for £56!

REUTERS/Lucas Jackson prev next prev next Thumbnail Enlarge Caption  Email More A A REUTERS: Declines in energy and financial stocks weighed on the S&P 500 on Monday and helped stall the Dow's pursuit of the 20,000 milestone ahead of earnings season and expected U.S. policy changes under the Donald Trump presidency. The Nasdaq notched a record high close, extending its bullish run with help from healthcare stocks. The S&P's energy sector dropped 1.5 percent as oil prices slid on concerns that rising Iraqi exports and U.S. output could dampen the impact of a deal among major producers to limit output. Elsewhere, investors were taking a breather ahead of fourth-quarter earnings and the Jan. 20 presidential inauguration. The S&P 500 benchmark has risen more than 6 percent since the Nov. 8 election of Donald Trump, who has pledged tax cuts, lighter regulation and fiscal stimulus, but investors are now waiting to see if he can deliver on those promises. "People are waiting for more information. We're waiting for political news, we're waiting for earnings. There's a lot of uncertainty out there. As the month goes on I expect we'll see some movement," said Peter Jankovskis, co-chief investment officer at OakBrook Investments LLC in Lisle, Illinois. The financial sector fell 0.8 percent on Monday. It had risen almost 18 percent since the election, led by banking stocks. Big banks will provide the first peek into how U.S. companies fared in the fourth quarter later this week. S&P 500 companies overall are expected to post a 5.8 percent increase in profit in the quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. "There is some hope we'll see some movement upward. Investors want to see some of those reports come out first," said Jankovskis. Two-thirds of the 30 Dow Jones Industrial Average components fell, keeping the psychologically significant 20,000 mark at bay. Goldman Sachs' 0.8 percent fall was its biggest drag followed by International Business Machine's 0.9 percent drop and Exxon Mobil's 1.7 percent decline. The Dow had come tantalizingly close to the milestone on Friday, hitting a peak of 19,999.63, as the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq also touched records after a late pop in tech stocks. "Our view about the Dow (hitting) 20,000 is not a matter of if, but a matter of when," said Matt Jones, U.S. head of equity strategy at J.P. Morgan Private Bank in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 76.42 points, or 0.38 percent, to 19,887.38, the S&P 500 had lost 8.08 points, or 0.354856 percent, to 2,268.9 and the Nasdaq Composite had added 10.76 points, or 0.19 percent, to 5,531.82. Eight of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were lower. The S&P's health sector was the biggest gainer with Merck & Co. the leading boost and Vertex Pharmaceuticals the biggest percentage gainer with a 4.4 pct jump after it issued guidance. Nasdaq's biggest drivers in the healthcare sector were Ariad Pharmaceuticals , which closed up 72.9 percent on a US$5.20 billion buyout deal with Japan's Takeda 4502.T Incyte with a 9.4 percent jump after it announced advancements in its cancer drug program with Merck. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.77-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.45-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 6 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 55 new highs and 16 new lows. About 6.4 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges on Monday compared with the 6.6 billion average for the last 20 sessions.

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration 1/2 left right Pedigree brand dry dog food is seen at the Safeway store in Wheaton, Maryland February 13, 2015. REUTERS/Gary Cameron 2/2 Candy and pet food conglomerate Mars Inc is buying veterinary hospital operator VCA Inc (WOOF.O) for $7.7 billion in a deal that will give the maker of Pedigree pet food an even bigger share of the $4 billion global pet healthcare market. The deal will help family-owned Mars, better known for candies such as M&Ms and Snickers, add about 800 pet hospitals to its network of more than 900 clinics, which includes the 61-year-old Banfield pet hospital chain. McLean, Virginia-based Mars is already the biggest pet food company in the world - it held a quarter of the $71.77 billion global pet food market as of 2015 - followed by Nestle SA (NESN.S), the maker of the Purina cat and dog food brand. Mars and Nestle also hold the mantle of being the No.1 and No.3 confectionary makers in the world, respectively, according to Euromonitor data. Candy makers have been diversifying their business as calorie-conscious consumers increasingly shun sugary sweets, a trend that has weighed on the $183 billion global confectionery market. Rival Hershey Co (HSY.N) is also expanding beyond chocolates - it bought Krave, a beef jerky maker, in 2015, while Mondelez International Inc (MDLZ.O) recently introduced Good Thins, its first snack brand in more than a decade. "While most of Mars Pet is focused on food, the firm had long dabbled in pet healthcare services," Morningstar analyst Debbie Wang wrote in a note. "Considering that growth in pet healthcare has averaged 7-8 percent over the long term, the addition of VCA would help Mars tap into this appealing market." Mars said it would offer $93 per share, a premium of 31.4 percent to VCA's Friday closing price. Including debt, the deal is valued at $9.1 billion. VCA's shares were up 19.8 percent at $90.60 in afternoon trading on Monday. The company, founded in 1986, had annual sales of $2.13 billion in 2015. Mars, which also owns the BluePearl chain of emergency and specialty veterinary care clinics, had annual pet food sales of $17.80 billion in 2015, according to Euromonitor data. Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC and BDT & Co were Mars' financial advisers, while Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom provided legal advice. Barclays was VCA's financial adviser and Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld LLP and Potter Anderson Corroon LLP were legal advisers.

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Monday, 9 January 2017 | MYT 11:27 PM Banks, oil stocks weigh on Wall St, keep Dow from 20,000 At 9:41am ET (Monday) the Dow was down 57 points, or 0.29%, at 19,906.8. The AFP photo shows traders working on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. NEW YORK: The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined on Monday, retreating from the historic 20,000 mark, weighed down by banks and energy companies, while a gain in technology stocks kept the Nasdaq afloat. Of its 30 components, 20 of the Dow’s stocks were trading lower, led by Goldman Sachs’s 1.4% decline. P&G fell 0.9% and Coca-Cola dropped 0.5% after Goldman downgraded both the consumer staple stocks. Eight of the 11 major S&P sectors were lower, led by the energy sector’s 1.3% drop.  Oil prices fell 2.3% as signs of growing US output outweighed optimism that other producers were sticking to a deal to cut supply to bolster prices. The decline meant the Dow moved further away from the 20,000-point mark. It came tantalisingly close on Friday, hitting a record of 19,999.63 as the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq also touched records after a late pop in technology stocks. The sector again helped the market on Monday. At 9:41am ET (1441 GMT) the Dow was down 57 points, or 0.29%, at 19,906.8. The S&P 500 was down 4.91 points, or 0.22%, at 2,272.07. The Nasdaq Composite was up 7.83 points, or 0.14%, at 5,528.89. “The market is building drama around 20,000 and if and when we get promising earnings reports, the Dow will go through the point like a hot knife through butter,” said Andre Bakhos, managing director at Janlyn Capital in Bernardsville, New Jersey. Wall Street’s rally since Donald Trump won the US election in November, with investors betting he will introduce business-friendly policies, has led to lofty valuations. The S&P is trading at about 17 times expected earnings, compared to its 10-year average of 14. That could make investors cautious as they gear up for the fourth-quarter earnings season. The first peek into how companies fared last quarter will be provided later this week by big US banks. S&P 500 companies overall are expected to post a 6.1% increase in profit in the quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Among stocks, Dow component UnitedHealth lost 0.6% to US$161.42 after the insurer’s Optum unit said it would buy Surgical Care Affiliates Inc for about US$2.30bil. Surgical Care’s stock was up 15%. VCA Inc, which runs hospitals for animals, soared 28% to US$90.78 after Mars Inc said it would buy the company for US$7.7bil. Acuity Brands was the biggest percentage loser on the S&P, falling 16% to US$199.16 after the lighting solutions provider reported first quarter sales that missed analysts’ expectations. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,741 to 915. On the Nasdaq, 1,469 issues fell and 942 advanced. The S&P 500 index showed three new 52-week highs and no new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 27 new highs and seven new lows. - Reuters Tags / Keywords: Foreign News , Stocks , Wall Street Related Stories Wall St gains as bank earnings boost confidence US stocks off to worst start in 2017 after Trump speech S&P, Nasdaq flat; Goldman leads Dow lower Wall St flat as banks, discretionary stocks fall, tech rises Wall St opens 2017 with big gains as banks surge You May Be Interested Boosting women's libido Glass discards now included in waste separation law Better rates via online forex services Paying high interest rates for personal loans Purple should be your favourite CNY colour Chinese herb Dang Shen helps to boost strength Others Also Read PCs on the rise Abang Johari starts work as Sarawak Chief Minister Do we really need to fear China money?

REUTERS/Lucas Jackson prev next prev next Thumbnail Enlarge Caption  Email More A A REUTERS: Declines in energy and financial stocks weighed on the S&P 500 on Monday and helped stall the Dow's pursuit of the 20,000 milestone ahead of earnings season and expected U.S. policy changes under the Donald Trump presidency. The Nasdaq notched a record high close, extending its bullish run with help from healthcare stocks. The S&P's energy sector dropped 1.5 percent as oil prices slid on concerns that rising Iraqi exports and U.S. output could dampen the impact of a deal among major producers to limit output. Elsewhere, investors were taking a breather ahead of fourth-quarter earnings and the Jan. 20 presidential inauguration. The S&P 500 benchmark has risen more than 6 percent since the Nov. 8 election of Donald Trump, who has pledged tax cuts, lighter regulation and fiscal stimulus, but investors are now waiting to see if he can deliver on those promises. "People are waiting for more information. We're waiting for political news, we're waiting for earnings. There's a lot of uncertainty out there. As the month goes on I expect we'll see some movement," said Peter Jankovskis, co-chief investment officer at OakBrook Investments LLC in Lisle, Illinois. The financial sector fell 0.8 percent on Monday. It had risen almost 18 percent since the election, led by banking stocks. Big banks will provide the first peek into how U.S. companies fared in the fourth quarter later this week. S&P 500 companies overall are expected to post a 5.8 percent increase in profit in the quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. "There is some hope we'll see some movement upward. Investors want to see some of those reports come out first," said Jankovskis. Two-thirds of the 30 Dow Jones Industrial Average components fell, keeping the psychologically significant 20,000 mark at bay. Goldman Sachs' 0.8 percent fall was its biggest drag followed by International Business Machine's 0.9 percent drop and Exxon Mobil's 1.7 percent decline. The Dow had come tantalizingly close to the milestone on Friday, hitting a peak of 19,999.63, as the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq also touched records after a late pop in tech stocks. "Our view about the Dow (hitting) 20,000 is not a matter of if, but a matter of when," said Matt Jones, U.S. head of equity strategy at J.P. Morgan Private Bank in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 76.42 points, or 0.38 percent, to 19,887.38, the S&P 500 had lost 8.08 points, or 0.354856 percent, to 2,268.9 and the Nasdaq Composite had added 10.76 points, or 0.19 percent, to 5,531.82. Eight of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were lower. The S&P's health sector was the biggest gainer with Merck & Co. the leading boost and Vertex Pharmaceuticals the biggest percentage gainer with a 4.4 pct jump after it issued guidance. Nasdaq's biggest drivers in the healthcare sector were Ariad Pharmaceuticals , which closed up 72.9 percent on a US$5.20 billion buyout deal with Japan's Takeda 4502.T Incyte with a 9.4 percent jump after it announced advancements in its cancer drug program with Merck. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.77-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.45-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 6 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 55 new highs and 16 new lows. About 6.4 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges on Monday compared with the 6.6 billion average for the last 20 sessions.

  Home U.K. News Sports U.S. Showbiz Australia Femail Health Science Money Video Travel Columnists Wires Home My Profile Logout Login Feedback DailyMail NEW ARTICLESHomeTop Share show ad Mars to buy pet healthcare provider VCA for $7.7 bln By Reuters Published: 12:56 EST, 9 January 2017 | Updated: 12:56 EST, 9 January 2017 e-mail Jan 9 (Reuters) - Candy and pet food conglomerate Mars Inc is buying veterinary hospital operator VCA Inc for $7.7 billion in a deal that will give the maker of Pedigree pet food an even bigger share of the $4 billion global pet healthcare market. The deal will help family-owned Mars, better known for candies such as M&Ms and Snickers, add about 800 pet hospitals to its network of more than 900 clinics, which includes the 61-year-old Banfield pet hospital chain. McLean, Virginia-based Mars is already the biggest pet food company in the world - it held a quarter of the $71.77 billion global pet food market as of 2015 - followed by Nestle SA , the maker of the Purina cat and dog food brand. Mars and Nestle also hold the mantle of being the No.1 and No.3 confectionary makers in the world, respectively, according to Euromonitor data. Candy makers have been diversifying their business as calorie-conscious consumers increasingly shun sugary sweets, a trend that has weighed on the $183 billion global confectionery market. Rival Hershey Co is also expanding beyond chocolates - it bought Krave, a beef jerky maker, in 2015, while Mondelez International Inc recently introduced Good Thins, its first snack brand in more than a decade. "While most of Mars Pet is focused on food, the firm had long dabbled in pet healthcare services," Morningstar analyst Debbie Wang wrote in a note. "Considering that growth in pet healthcare has averaged 7-8 percent over the long term, the addition of VCA would help Mars tap into this appealing market." Mars said it would offer $93 per share, a premium of 31.4 percent to VCA's Friday closing price. Including debt, the deal is valued at $9.1 billion. VCA's shares were up 19.8 percent at $90.60 in afternoon trading on Monday. The company, founded in 1986, had annual sales of $2.13 billion in 2015. Mars, which also owns the BluePearl chain of emergency and specialty veterinary care clinics, had annual pet food sales of $17.80 billion in 2015, according to Euromonitor data. Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC and BDT & Co were Mars' financial advisers, while Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom provided legal advice. Barclays was VCA's financial adviser and Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld LLP and Potter Anderson Corroon LLP were legal advisers.

This news is bound to send selfie-lovers into raptures. But while 3D photography on a smartphone, no doubt, is an exciting prospect, what if we were to tell you that there's much more that some new-age smartphone cameras can achieve? How about using the camera on your phone to sense food quality, for instance? What if it could screen you for anaemia or help you brush your teeth better? Researchers across the globe today have tweaked and developed smartphone cameras into tools that can do all this and more. Detecting melanoma Melanoma is one of the deadliest forms of skin cancer, but if detected in the early stages, the chances of survival are remarkably high. Now, researchers are working on devising a new way to detect the disease not with blood tests, but with a smartphone camera. In an IBM Research blog post, cognitive computing and computer vision scientist Noel Codella mentions how, in the future, doctors and patients will be able to identify possible signs of melanoma with the help of skin image analysis. "Our vision is that taking pictures to diagnose melanoma might one day be as routine as drawing blood to detect other diseases. Equipped with a smartphone or any other camera attached to a dermascope, this type of technology would enable doctors, nurses or support staff to take a photo of a lesion, send it to a cloud-based analytics service and receive a detailed report," Codella writes in the blog post. © image This report, Codella writes, could help a clinician determine whether the lesion has characteristics of melanoma or any other type of skin cancer. It would also contain other relevant information, which might further assist the medical staff in assessing a patient. Once implemented in clinical practice, this technology could be a game-changer since there are currently no reliable blood tests for melanoma. In 2015, the IBM Research team published preliminary research on this topic in which they explained the ability of computer vision approaches to help find disease markers in dermoscopy images. They have also directly compared the performance of these new methods to that of eight specialists. A well-established dermatologist, writes Codella, sees 25 or more patients per day. Assuming there are approximately 20 workdays in a month, this results in over 6,000 patients per year, with potentially multiple lesions observed in each patient. By comparison, writes Codella, the IBM system has seen fewer than 3,000 lesions, meaning its experience level is along the lines of a medical student. "But the hope is that, one day, the simple act of taking a picture could help clinicians quickly and accurately test for melanoma and other dangerous skin diseases," Codella writes. The technology, however, remains a work in progress, as it requires more research and testing.

Wondering how? The Genius 9000 toothbrush, developed by the Oral-B brand of Procter & Gamble, teaches people to brush more effectively with the help of their smartphone camera. The toothbrush is fitted with a set of accelerometers that measure changes in motion in three dimensions, calculating even minute changes in brush angles. This is where the smartphone camera comes into the picture. All you need to do is download an app, created by P&G scientists and the Fraunhofer Society for the Advancement of Applied Research, on your smartphone. This app uses the smartphone's camera and facial recognition technology to measure the position of the brush relative to the mouth — Oral-B has termed this "position detection". Users just have to place their smartphone in front of them when they brush — they can attach it to the bathroom mirror using a suction cup holder that comes with the toothbrush, which is available online (R32,000). The app then shows a user which parts of the mouth have been brushed properly and which areas need more work. When a user starts brushing, the app displays a circle in six blue segments corresponding to the six areas of the mouth. As you brush each area, the blue fades, leaving a clean white segment. The app also remembers the user's past 30 brushing sessions. The smartphone app that links to the brush can also be programmed by your dental professional to issue notes and reminders during and after a brushing session. But does it work? Well, initial data for the Oral-B Genius 9000 shows that some users now brush for 2 minutes and 24 seconds on an average, which is more than the recommended time of two minutes twice a day. ALSO SEE: Smartphones 2016: The best you can buy Smartphones 2016: The best you can buy Finger vein reading Finger vein reading is a popular method of biometric authentication. A type of infrared light is transmitted through the finger and partially absorbed by hemoglobin in the veins to capture a unique finger vein pattern profile, which is then matched with a pre-registered profile to verify individual identity. Now, Japanese tech giant Hitachi has developed a technology in which the smartphone camera can be used for such authentication. As per the company, this is the first practical finger vein authentication technology that uses a phone's camera. The use of colour information software makes this technology more effective than the infrared variant. Additionally, multiple fingers can be used in this technology, which improves accuracy — the colour and shape of fingers are registered in advance. The technology can even extract fingers from a background image. There's also the provision of normalising finger postures, so that authentication can be done even when the angle of the hand changes. Hitachi tested the technology in-house. Pictures were taken using an 8-MP camera and transferred to a tablet computer for authentication. And even though the technology was used with Android, the company has plans to support iOS as well when it's ready for commercial use. As per the company, this technology can replace the traditional means of authentication when it comes to financial transactions, online shopping and so on. What makes finger vein authentication more feasible is the security aspect. Biometric authentication methods such as fingerprints, voiceprint and facial recognition are prone to spoofing and can be forged easily. But finger vein authentication is impervious to security threats because one can't possibly replicate vein patterns. Also, at the time of commercialisation, Hitachi plans to use a smartphone or a cloud server to carry out the authentication instead of a tablet. Detecting anaemia Anaemia remains a major problem in developing countries. Take India, for instance. A recent National Family Health Survey found that over 55% of Indian women were anaemic. But how does a smartphone camera enter the frame? The answer comes from the University of Washington, where scientists have developed an application called HemaApp, which uses a smartphone camera (and the flash) to estimate haemoglobin concentration and screen for anaemia. All one has to do is focus the light from the camera's flash on to a patient's finger. HemaApp then analyses the colour of the blood. It continuously floods a patient's finger with different wavelengths of light and infrared energy, and creates a series of videos. By analysing how colours are absorbed and reflected across those wavelengths, HemaApp can detect the concentration of haemoglobin and other blood components such as plasma. Researchers say they tested the app under three different conditions: using the smartphone camera's flash alone; in combination with a common incandescent light bulb; and with a low-cost LED lighting attachment. The app correctly identified cases of low haemoglobin levels 79% of the time when used with just the phone camera. This number went up to 86% when the app was used with some additional light source. To ensure it worked on different skin tones, the team developed processing algorithms that use a patient's pulse to differentiate between the properties of the patient's blood and the physical characteristics of his/her finger, the paper said. As per the university website, HemaApp is not meant to replace traditional blood tests, which are more accurate, but researchers do believe that the app can be an effective and affordable initial screening tool to determine whether further blood testing is needed or not. As of now, the app is set for more testing. Check health, food quality Researchers from VTT Technical Research Centre in Finland have developed the world's first hyperspectral mobile device by converting the camera on an iPhone into an optical sensor that can sense food quality, as well as monitor health. As per the VTT website, the cost-effective optical MEMS (micro opto electro mechanical systems) spectral technology enables the development of new mobile applications for environmental sensing and monitoring vehicles and drones' other uses include food analysis and health monitoring. "Consumer benefits could appear in health applications such as mobile phones that are able to check whether food is edible or moles are malignant," says Anna Rissanen, research team leader, VTT. Hyperspectral imaging provides access to the optical spectrum at each point of an image, enabling a wide range of measurements. The adjustable MEMS filter is integrated with the camera lens and its adjustment is synchronised with the camera's image capture system. The hyperspectral sensor measures the data in each camera pixel of the target. This spectral data can be transformed into information about the measurement target by developing intelligent computational algorithms. Some features, like fruit freshness, can also be seen from the spectral image without algorithms, but most applications usually require processing of the data. The sensor can also verify product authenticity or identify users based on biometric data. The VTT website adds that the centre aims to work with companies to commercialise the tech and bring new innovative optical sensor products to the market in the future. They have already developed a wide range of new applications, including environmental sensing based on nano-satellites, drone applications for precision agriculture, forest monitoring, etc. Go to MSN Home Go to MSN News Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

Last year, PakTech spent $2.5 million to buy an 86,000-square-foot former RV parts factory on an 8-acre site, east of Interstate 5, in Cottage Grove. The company plans to spend another $2 million on renovations, $3.4 million on new equipment and $200,000 on furnishings, said Jim Borg, founder and president of PakTech. The plant will be in the former home of Kwikee Products, which built stairs for RV manufacturers, until it closed in 2007. Borg said he hopes to open the new plant in March with about 30 employees, and its workforce will grow as PakTech’s business grows. The building is big enough to eventually have 200-plus employees, said Karen Nielsen, PakTech’s human resources manager. The site is in the Cottage Grove/Creswell/South Lane County Enterprise Zone. In early December, PakTech applied for three years of property-tax waivers on the $5.6 million it plans to spend on improvements. The amount of the tax savings won’t be known until PakTech completes the improvements and the value of those investments is assessed, said Peter Reaksecker, an analyst with Lane County Assessment & Taxation. In addition to the Cottage Grove plant, PakTech operates two factories, about a mile apart, in an industrial section of northwest Eugene. The plants employ about 200 people. In 1993, Borg was making plastic injection-molded parts for electronics and other firms when a customer request nudged the business in a new direction. Eugene-based Echo Springs Dairy asked Borg to design a handle to bind two one-gallon jugs of milk, so the dairy could sell milk to Costco. Today, PakTech sells custom-designed handles to 600 to 700 customers, including well-known brands Campbell’s, Welch’s, Heinz, Procter & Gamble, Johnson & Johnson and a growing number of craft breweries, Borg said. PakTech makes handles in huge industrial mold presses. Small plastic resin pellets, mixed with coloring, are injected into molds, heated, solidified through pressure and cooled with water in seconds. The privately held company does not disclose annual revenues, but it has grown steadily over the years. “We’ve sustained double-­digit growth most of the last 10 years,” Borg said. PakTech has benefited from the rise of warehouse shopping and the recent growth in craft beer, he said. Borg anticipates gross sales this year will be up 17 percent from last year. The bulk of PakTech’s sales are in the United States — mostly on the East Coast. It also serves global customers through warehouses in Mexico, London, and Sydney, Australia. PakTech frequently gets offers from buyers, which Borg said he declines. “We’re at the size where we’re very attractive to consolidators, and I just say we’re not interested,” he said. “We’re having fun doing what we’re doing and we want to continue it. “I don’t see any advantage in having a large bank account and nothing to do. We like what we do. We create value. We have win-win relationships with our customers.” PakTech “will be local as long as I’m in control of it, and that will probably be until I drop dead,” Borg said. “This is a lot more fun than playing golf,” the 74-year-old businessman said. Borg’s son, Zak Borg, and daughter, Amie Thomas, both work in the family business. Zak Borg, 45, is the director of engineering and R&D, and Thomas is the marketing director. Jim Borg said he is discussing succession with his children. “Neither of them wants to do what I do, so somebody’s going to have to step into a leadership position at some point,” Jim Borg said. “They both want to retain interest in the business, and they may do that from a board of directors role rather than active day-to-day role,” he said. Cottage Grove move PakTech had tried to expand on land it bought near its Eugene factories that was outside the city limits but within the city’s urban growth boundary and subject to city development rules. PakTech made the leap south to Cottage Grove after wrangling for more than a year with Eugene planners who maintained that the land would have to be annexed into the city limits, making it subject to higher property taxes, in order for PakTech to build on it. PakTech turned to Cottage Grove, where it found the former Kwikee Products factory it could remodel for its purposes. The building had been seized in 2015 by Wells Fargo Bank, the lender of its former owner, K&M Holdings LLC, of Seattle. Construction is progressing at PakTech’s newest plant. “We’re putting a new roof on,” Borg said, adding that the building sat vacant for seven years and the roof leaked. Crews are refurbishing the interior, installing skylights for energy efficiency, adding insulation, putting in a new electrical system, upgrading heating and air-conditioning for climate control, and polishing the cement floor. “The timeline is to finish by early March,” Borg said. “We want to have the equipment moved in and be producing parts by the end of March.” About a dozen of the 30 employees will be transferred from PakTech’s main 175-employee factory on Irving Road, Borg said. “We have a number of employees who already live in (the Cottage Grove) area,” said Nielsen, PakTech’s human resources manager. “Most have asked to be transferred.” PakTech will move two large pieces of equipment from its Irving Road plant to Cottage Grove and buy two more, Borg said. The equipment will run 24 hours a day, five days a week, Borg said. Hiring plans PakTech will be hiring for positions in production, inventory control, quality control and the warehouse. Entry-level jobs start at $15 an hour, Borg said. Workers typically start as employees of temporary services firms, Nielsen said. After they complete 90 to 120 days of training, workers qualify for company benefits, such as health insurance and a 401(k) retirement savings plan. PakTech pays 100 percent of health insurance premiums for employees and half of the premium for their dependents. When the company is profitable, it shares the profit with employees through a quarterly bonus equal to about 20 percent of an employee’s wage, Borg said. The company has zero tolerance for disrespectful behavior of any kind in the workplace, he said. “We have women in positions of leadership — people of color — it doesn’t matter,” Borg said. “If a person wants to work and they’re willing to give their time and effort, we want them to feel it’s a safe place, a place where they belong and where they’re valued.” PakTech also wants employees to be proactive and point out any problems they see, Borg said. “We’re very fussy about the product that we ship out the door,” he said. “We have very large customers, (and) if there’s a problem created by our negligence, we have to pay for the problem, which could be millions of dollars in recalls,” Borg said. The company will be looking for people with experience or training in injection molding, or a willingness to be trained, he said. More important than having any particular degree is an employee’s personality and attitude, Borg said. “What we look for in employees is personality,” he said. “Is this a team player, or is it a person with a chip on their shoulder? If they’re a rotten apple, no one is going to want to work with them.” Adding the satellite factory 20 miles away in Cottage Grove will add a new layer of complexity for the company. “There will be issues, there’s no question about it,” Borg said. One question is whether the Cottage Grove site will develop the same sense of community as PakTech’s main plant on Irving Road, he said. “It’s a pretty close-knit group of people,” Borg said. “People socialize together. We have company parties. They’re always well attended. We’re able to get our employees to buy into the team spirit very well. We’re hoping to have that same sense of camaraderie with the Cottage Grove operation, but it may be difficult. We really don’t know.” Follow Sherri on Twitter @sburimcdonald .

Looking around at her Labour colleagues from the 2015 parliamentary intake, the new MP for Dewsbury in West Yorkshire saw former special advisers and academic high-fliers with Oxbridge degrees. “I’d never been to university, so I felt completely out of my depth,” sighs Sherriff. “But then you find your way, you find your place. I’ll never be an expert in economics, but if you want somebody to get something through then I’m probably your girl because I’ve got this incredible northern grit.” The 41-year-old former Unison shop steward found her way pretty quickly and has become one of the breakout stars of the 2015 cohort. Last week, the Guardian revealed that Tesco had pledged to reduce the price of women’s twin-blade razors to the same as men’s at 50p for a pack of five following Sherriff’s pressure on the supermarket giant. Kari Daniels, Tesco’s commercial director, wrote to Sherriff to insist the products were not simply a different colour – pink rather than blue – but added that Britain’s biggest supermarket would act “on concerns about the difference in price”. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Paula Sherriff. Photograph: Christopher Thomond for the Guardian Tesco’s concession is already being viewed as one of the major victories in the war to end gender price discrimination on the high street. The news added just a little extra lustre to a short but glittering parliamentary CV that includes: persuading Boots to pilot a scheme to let customers gift sanitary products to food banks; forcing WH Smith to lower product prices in hospital shops to match those in high street stores; and making House of Commons history in her bid to abolish the so-called tampon tax. Sherriff joined the police at 18 and then spent 13 years in healthcare, but, as an MP she is defining herself as the champion of the shopper. She tweeted after the Tesco story broke: Paula Sherriff MP (@paulasherriff) Really pleased with this result. Chipping away at gender pricing bit by bit. Watch out retailers-I'm onto you! https://t.co/u7ZJlCEJwI January 1, 2017 Her efforts in highlighting gender price discrimination in clothes, beauty products and toys during a parliamentary debate, secured in her name last February, were noted by Jeremy Corbyn. Sherriff did not vote for him in either of his leadership election victories – she backed Yvette Cooper in 2015 and then Owen Smith last summer – but he still made her Labour’s women and equalities spokeswoman in October’s reshuffle. Fresh off her Tesco triumph, Sherriff will now push supermarkets and major brands to sign up to a charter pledging not to “knowingly impose” prices that rip-off women. Analysis suggests that products aimed at women are, on average, 37% more expensive than identical items marketed to men. “It’s time just to raise an awareness among retailers about the ‘pink tax’ or the ‘sexist surcharge’ or whatever you want to call it,” says Sherriff. “I just like the idea of asking them to not just talk about specific items but to sign up to this mentality. I just like the idea of shops saying: ‘We do not impose a sexist surcharge.’” The sexist surcharge – how women ​get ripped off on the high street Read more This month Sherriff will meet executives at Proctor & Gamble, which manufactures the Tampax and Always feminine hygiene brands, to talk about how it can help with The Homeless Period Campaign by donating sanitary products to shelters. An online petition aimed at P&G gathered nearly 70,000 signatures. This follows Sherriff’s success over the Tampon Tax last year, when she became the first opposition MP to amend a government’s budget. Sherriff was furious that tampons carry 5% VAT – or “vagina added tax” as she memorably described it to the House of Commons – because of European Union rules. At a birthday party for Clive Lewis, who is now shadow business secretary, Sherriff told senior party aide Nick Parrott that she was desperate to remove the rate altogether. Parrott devised a “long-shot” plan that allowed Sherriff two attempts at forcing the government to accept a zero rate. After narrowly losing the first time around, Parrott and Sherriff ambushed the government by making a Faustian pact with a group of Conservative Brexiters to sign an amendment to abolish VAT on tampons. This was tabled shortly before the finance bill debate took place, so that the Conservative whips had no time to persuade rebels to change their minds. The government had to adopt the amendment or face humiliating defeat. David Cameron headed to Brussels, where the UK and other EU members states were granted permission to abolish VAT on sanitary products. “All the major retailers have agreed in writing that they will pass the savings on to the consumer,” says Sherriff, proudly. Prior to this nugget of Commons’ history, Sherriff had already forced WH Smith to drop its prices in hospital shops. As a junior manager responsible for outpatient services in Wakefield, Pontefract and Dewsbury, Sherriff found out how chains would sell their products at a premium in hospitals. For example, people were paying 89p more for a bottle of water in a WH Smith shop in a Wakefield hospital than they would in Leeds city centre. WH Smith bowed to the pressure and lowered prices on items such as “get well soon” cards. Today, Sherriff is full of praise for the chain. “Stephen Clarke, who is the CEO, keeps in touch with me literally monthly, saying: ‘Look, if there are any problems, just let us know.’ It’s fantastic, all credit to them.” By contrast, Marks & Spencer refused to yield on its higher prices in hospital outlets, arguing it was impossible because they are run under franchise and forcing cuts would breach competition law. But M&S had better heed her Twitter warning: the high Sherriff of shops is preparing to ride into town once more and she isn’t about to let any major retailer escape her sights.

Home Industry Technology New age smartphone cameras: Not just selfies, detect anaemia, check food quality and more New age smartphone cameras: Not just selfies, detect anaemia, check food quality and more If you thought a smartphone camera was good enough to only click selfies, think again. From sensing food quality to screening for anaemia, there’s much more to the new-age smartphone camera than meets the eye. By: Nitin Sreedhar | Published: January 8, 2017 6:04 AM Researchers across the globe today have tweaked and developed smartphone cameras into tools that can do all this and more. (Reuters) THE LATEST report doing the rounds regarding the launch of iPhone 8 some time next year is that Apple is working with LG to develop a smartphone camera module that would enable 3D photography. This news is bound to send selfie-lovers into raptures. But while 3D photography on a smartphone, no doubt, is an exciting prospect, what if we were to tell you that there’s much more that some new-age smartphone cameras can achieve? How about using the camera on your phone to sense food quality, for instance? What if it could screen you for anaemia or help you brush your teeth better? Researchers across the globe today have tweaked and developed smartphone cameras into tools that can do all this and more. Detecting melanoma Melanoma is one of the deadliest forms of skin cancer, but if detected in the early stages, the chances of survival are remarkably high. Now, researchers are working on devising a new way to detect the disease not with blood tests, but with a smartphone camera. In an IBM Research blog post, cognitive computing and computer vision scientist Noel Codella mentions how, in the future, doctors and patients will be able to identify possible signs of melanoma with the help of skin image analysis. “Our vision is that taking pictures to diagnose melanoma might one day be as routine as drawing blood to detect other diseases. Equipped with a smartphone or any other camera attached to a dermascope, this type of technology would enable doctors, nurses or support staff to take a photo of a lesion, send it to a cloud-based analytics service and receive a detailed report,” Codella writes in the blog post. This report, Codella writes, could help a clinician determine whether the lesion has characteristics of melanoma or any other type of skin cancer. It would also contain other relevant information, which might further assist the medical staff in assessing a patient. Once implemented in clinical practice, this technology could be a game-changer since there are currently no reliable blood tests for melanoma. In 2015, the IBM Research team published preliminary research on this topic in which they explained the ability of computer vision approaches to help find disease markers in dermoscopy images. They have also directly compared the performance of these new methods to that of eight specialists. A well-established dermatologist, writes Codella, sees 25 or more patients per day. Assuming there are approximately 20 workdays in a month, this results in over 6,000 patients per year, with potentially multiple lesions observed in each patient. By comparison, writes Codella, the IBM system has seen fewer than 3,000 lesions, meaning its experience level is along the lines of a medical student. “But the hope is that, one day, the simple act of taking a picture could help clinicians quickly and accurately test for melanoma and other dangerous skin diseases,” Codella writes. The technology, however, remains a work in progress, as it requires more research and testing. The Genius 9000 toothbrush, developed by the Oral-B brand of Procter & Gamble, teaches people to brush more effectively with the help of their smartphone camera. Brushing teeth better The same camera that lets you click that picture-perfect selfie can now help you brush your teeth better. Wondering how? The Genius 9000 toothbrush, developed by the Oral-B brand of Procter & Gamble, teaches people to brush more effectively with the help of their smartphone camera. The toothbrush is fitted with a set of accelerometers that measure changes in motion in three dimensions, calculating even minute changes in brush angles. This is where the smartphone camera comes into the picture. All you need to do is download an app, created by P&G scientists and the Fraunhofer Society for the Advancement of Applied Research, on your smartphone. This app uses the smartphone’s camera and facial recognition technology to measure the position of the brush relative to the mouth—Oral-B has termed this ‘position detection’. Users just have to place their smartphone in front of them when they brush—they can attach it to the bathroom mirror using a suction cup holder that comes with the toothbrush, which is available online (R32,000). The app then shows a user which parts of the mouth have been brushed properly and which areas need more work. When a user starts brushing, the app displays a circle in six blue segments corresponding to the six areas of the mouth. As you brush each area, the blue fades, leaving a clean white segment. The app also remembers the user’s past 30 brushing sessions. The smartphone app that links to the brush can also be programmed by your dental professional to issue notes and reminders during and after a brushing session. But does it work? Well, initial data for the Oral-B Genius 9000 shows that some users now brush for 2 minutes and 24 seconds on an average, which is more than the recommended time of two minutes twice a day. Japanese tech giant Hitachi has developed a technology in which the smartphone camera can be used for such authentication. Finger vein reading Finger vein reading is a popular method of biometric authentication. A type of infrared light is transmitted through the finger and partially absorbed by hemoglobin in the veins to capture a unique finger vein pattern profile, which is then matched with a pre-registered profile to verify individual identity. Now, Japanese tech giant Hitachi has developed a technology in which the smartphone camera can be used for such authentication. As per the company, this is the first practical finger vein authentication technology that uses a phone’s camera. The use of colour information software makes this technology more effective than the infrared variant. Additionally, multiple fingers can be used in this technology, which improves accuracy—the colour and shape of fingers are registered in advance. The technology can even extract fingers from a background image. There’s also the provision of normalising finger postures, so that authentication can be done even when the angle of the hand changes. Hitachi tested the technology in-house. Pictures were taken using an 8-MP camera and transferred to a tablet computer for authentication. And even though the technology was used with Android, the company has plans to support iOS as well when it’s ready for commercial use. As per the company, this technology can replace the traditional means of authentication when it comes to financial transactions, online shopping and so on. What makes finger vein authentication more feasible is the security aspect. Biometric authentication methods such as fingerprints, voiceprint and facial recognition are prone to spoofing and can be forged easily. But finger vein authentication is impervious to security threats because one can’t possibly replicate vein patterns. Also, at the time of commercialisation, Hitachi plans to use a smartphone or a cloud server to carry out the authentication instead of a tablet. The answer comes from the University of Washington, where scientists have developed an application called HemaApp, which uses a smartphone camera (and the flash) to estimate haemoglobin concentration and screen for anaemia. Detecting anaemia Anaemia remains a major problem in developing countries. Take India, for instance. A recent National Family Health Survey found that over 55% of Indian women were anaemic. But how does a smartphone camera enter the frame? The answer comes from the University of Washington, where scientists have developed an application called HemaApp, which uses a smartphone camera (and the flash) to estimate haemoglobin concentration and screen for anaemia. All one has to do is focus the light from the camera’s flash on to a patient’s finger. HemaApp then analyses the colour of the blood. It continuously floods a patient’s finger with different wavelengths of light and infrared energy, and creates a series of videos. By analysing how colours are absorbed and reflected across those wavelengths, HemaApp can detect the concentration of haemoglobin and other blood components such as plasma. Researchers say they tested the app under three different conditions: using the smartphone camera’s flash alone; in combination with a common incandescent light bulb; and with a low-cost LED lighting attachment. The app correctly identified cases of low haemoglobin levels 79% of the time when used with just the phone camera. This number went up to 86% when the app was used with some additional light source. To ensure it worked on different skin tones, the team developed processing algorithms that use a patient’s pulse to differentiate between the properties of the patient’s blood and the physical characteristics of his/her finger, the paper said. As per the university website, HemaApp is not meant to replace traditional blood tests—which are more accurate—but researchers do believe that the app can be an effective and affordable initial screening tool to determine whether further blood testing is needed or not. As of now, the app is set for more testing. Some features, like fruit freshness, can also be seen from the spectral image without algorithms, but most applications usually require processing of the data. Check health, food quality Researchers from VTT Technical Research Centre in Finland have developed the world’s first hyperspectral mobile device by converting the camera on an iPhone into an optical sensor that can sense food quality, as well as monitor health. As per the VTT website, the cost-effective optical MEMS (micro opto electro mechanical systems) spectral technology enables the development of new mobile applications for environmental sensing and monitoring vehicles and drones—other uses include food analysis and health monitoring. “Consumer benefits could appear in health applications such as mobile phones that are able to check whether food is edible or moles are malignant,” says Anna Rissanen, research team leader, VTT. You May Also Want To Watch: Hyperspectral imaging provides access to the optical spectrum at each point of an image, enabling a wide range of measurements. The adjustable MEMS filter is integrated with the camera lens and its adjustment is synchronised with the camera’s image capture system. The hyperspectral sensor measures the data in each camera pixel of the target. This spectral data can be transformed into information about the measurement target by developing intelligent computational algorithms. Some features, like fruit freshness, can also be seen from the spectral image without algorithms, but most applications usually require processing of the data. The sensor can also verify product authenticity or identify users based on biometric data. The VTT website adds that the centre aims to work with companies to commercialise the tech and bring new innovative optical sensor products to the market in the future. They have already developed a wide range of new applications, including environmental sensing based on nano-satellites, drone applications for precision agriculture, forest monitoring, etc. Please Wait while comments are loading...

Who says you have to be an energy drink to advertise like one? Canada Dry, part of the Dr. Pepper Snapple Group Inc. portfolio of brands, is making a push with the sporting crowd as the popularity of energy drinks grows among consumers. But it’s not actually launching a new energy drink. The ginger ale brand has previously pushed a message about relaxation in ads focused on the drink’s ginger-farm roots. It’s now turning to scenes from the gym for its latest spots, which will debut Monday on ESPN and NBC Sports. But the ads still hang on to their “relaxation” theme. Consumers are increasingly turning away from traditional carbonated drinks and toward beverages like energy drinks. Cowen & Company analysts suggested last month that Coca Cola Co. KO, -0.17%   acquire the remaining stake in Monster Beverage Corp. MNST, +3.25%   in order to take full advantage of this trend. “While consumers are clearly showing increased concern over sugar consumption, the consumer has not rejected sugary beverages outright as we consistently see outsized growth for sugar beverage categories that also offer consumers a functional benefit to help justify that sugary beverage occasion,” analysts wrote in a note. Read also: It’s time to sell Coke and P&G stocks, Goldman says The new ad also comes on the heels of an upgrade of Dr. Pepper Snapple DPS, +0.06%   by Goldman Sachs. “While in general we do not favor large companies buying into growth, we believe the recently announced acquisition of Bai, should it close on announced terms, is a strategic fit that could bolster Dr. Pepper Snapple’s sales growth and de-risk a potential distribution loss that could occur if Bai is sold to another company,” the Monday note said. Bai is a line of antioxidant beverages made with “smart sweeteners” like those from the Stevia leaf. Analysts also believe that Dr. Pepper Snapple is well-positioned if tax policies change. “[I]n the even broader tax policy changes occur as currently proposed, Dr. Pepper Snapple would be a relative beneficiary given its current high tax rate (35%), limited mismatch from a destination-based tax perspective, and low likelihood of sizeable incremental debt post the announced Bai acquisition,” the note said. Dr. Pepper Snapple shares are down 0.3% in Tuesday, and are down 2.4% for the past 12 months. The S&P 500 index SPX, +0.18%   is up 18% for the past year.

By Zachary Tracer and Craig Giammona Bloomberg Candy giant Mars Inc., facing a slowdown in packaged food, is making a bigger bet on a booming industry: pet care. The maker of M&Ms and Snickers agreed to buy the animal-hospital chain VCA Inc. for about $7.7 billion on Monday — not including debt — expanding on its existing veterinary-care business. Mars will pay $93 a share in cash, a 31 percent premium to VCA’s closing price of $70.77 on Friday. The acquisition turns Mars into a dominant company in corporate-owned pet hospitals, an area that’s exploded in recent years — helped by Americans treating their pets more like family members. It also could help bolster Mars’s current pet brands, including Pedigree and Whiskas. At a time when human food isn’t growing as quickly, the deal may make more sense for Mars than buying another snack business, said Ken Shea, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “They see growth and they see diversity,” he said. “Why double down on food when it’s not growing that fast?” The total value for the deal is about $9.1 billion, including $1.4 billion in outstanding debt. Shares of VCA, which trade under the ticker WOOF, surged as much as 29 percent to $91.03 on Monday after the transaction was announced. Closely held Mars had already been building out its pet business, including both food and hospital care. The company owns Banfield Pet Hospital and BluePearl Veterinary Partners, and it’s acquired pet-food brands from Procter & Gamble Co. VCA, meanwhile, operates almost 800 animal hospitals in the U.S. and Canada. The deeper push into the pet business by Mars comes as large packaged-food companies are struggling with flagging sales. Changing consumer tastes, particularly a desire for less processed foods, has made it difficult for the companies that have dominated grocery-store shelves. Efforts to reduce sugar intake have struck an additional blow to candy makers such as Mars. That’s added pressure to diversify their portfolios. Spending on pets has surged in the U.S., fueled by the “humanization” of dogs and cats. Americans spent $35 billion on veterinary care in 2015. VCA, a pioneer in the field, has grown by buying up hundreds of veterinary hospitals — an approach that’s now being adopted by rival companies. Mars, based in McLean, Virginia, expects the VCA deal to be completed in the third quarter. Morgan Stanley and BDT & Co. provided financial advice to Mars, while legal advisers included Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, Simpson Thacher & Bartlett and McDermott Will & Emery. Barclays advised VCA, and the company’s legal advisers were Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld and Potter Anderson Corroon. “VCA is a leader across pet health care and the opportunity we see together — for pets, pet owners, veterinarians and other pet-care providers — is tremendous,” Mars Chief Executive Officer Grant Reid said in a statement.

The S&P's energy sector dropped 1.4 percent as oil prices slid on concerns that rising Iraqi exports and U.S. output could dampen the impact of a deal among major producers to limit output. Investors were taking a breather ahead of the fourth-quarter earnings season and the next U.S. President's administration. The S&P 500 benchmark has risen more than 6 percent since the Nov. 8 election of Donald Trump who has promised tax cuts, lighter regulation and fiscal stimulus. "We're waiting for the roll-out of earnings and the initial forays of the Trump administration," Stephen Massocca, chief investment officer, Wedbush Equity Management LLC in San Francisco. "I don't see significant moves in the market until those events unwind." The financial sector was down 0.6 percent on Monday. Big banks will provide the first peek into how U.S. companies fared in the fourth quarter later this week. S&P 500 companies overall are expected to post a 5.8 percent increase in profit in the quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Two-thirds of the 30 Dow components were lower, keeping the psychologically significant 20,000 mark at bay. International Business Machine's 0.9 percent drop was the Dow's biggest drag. Exxon Mobil's 1.7 percent decline and a 1.2 percent drop in Chevron were also big weights. The Dow came tantalizingly close to the milestone on Friday, hitting a peak of 19,999.63, as the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq also touched records after a late pop in tech stocks. "Our view about the Dow (hitting) 20,000 is not a matter of if, but a matter of when," said Matt Jones, U.S. head of equity strategy at J.P. Morgan Private Bank in New York. At 2:53 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 59.09 points, or 0.3 percent, to 19,904.71, the S&P 500 had lost 6.5 points, or 0.285466 percent, to 2,270.48 and the Nasdaq Composite had added 10.94 points, or 0.2 percent, to 5,531.99. Eight of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were lower. The S&P's health sector was the biggest gainer helped by a string of multi-billion dollar deals. Nasdaq was boosted most by healthcare stocks, led by Incyte's 19.9 percent jump after it announced advancements in its cancer drug program. The consumer staples sector was down 0.6 percent with P&G and Coca-Cola among the biggest drags after Goldman Sachs downgraded the stocks to "sell." Pet hospital operator VCA jumped 28 percent after agreeing to a $7.7 billion buyout offer from candy and pet foods maker Mars Inc. Ariad Pharma surged nearly 73 percent on a $5.20 billion buyout deal with Japan's Takeda. Surgical Care Affiliates jumped 16 percent on a deal to be bought by UnitedHealth for about $2.30 billion. Dow component UnitedHealth dipped 0.3 percent. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.55-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.37-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 5 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 53 new highs and 15 new lows.

REUTERS/Lucas Jackson prev next prev next Thumbnail Enlarge Caption  Email More A A REUTERS: Declines in energy and financial stocks weighed on the S&P 500 on Monday and helped stall the Dow's pursuit of the 20,000 milestone ahead of earnings season and expected U.S. policy changes under the Donald Trump presidency. The Nasdaq notched a record high close, extending its bullish run with help from healthcare stocks. The S&P's energy sector dropped 1.5 percent as oil prices slid on concerns that rising Iraqi exports and U.S. output could dampen the impact of a deal among major producers to limit output. Elsewhere, investors were taking a breather ahead of fourth-quarter earnings and the Jan. 20 presidential inauguration. The S&P 500 benchmark has risen more than 6 percent since the Nov. 8 election of Donald Trump, who has pledged tax cuts, lighter regulation and fiscal stimulus, but investors are now waiting to see if he can deliver on those promises. "People are waiting for more information. We're waiting for political news, we're waiting for earnings. There's a lot of uncertainty out there. As the month goes on I expect we'll see some movement," said Peter Jankovskis, co-chief investment officer at OakBrook Investments LLC in Lisle, Illinois. The financial sector fell 0.8 percent on Monday. It had risen almost 18 percent since the election, led by banking stocks. Big banks will provide the first peek into how U.S. companies fared in the fourth quarter later this week. S&P 500 companies overall are expected to post a 5.8 percent increase in profit in the quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. "There is some hope we'll see some movement upward. Investors want to see some of those reports come out first," said Jankovskis. Two-thirds of the 30 Dow Jones Industrial Average components fell, keeping the psychologically significant 20,000 mark at bay. Goldman Sachs' 0.8 percent fall was its biggest drag followed by International Business Machine's 0.9 percent drop and Exxon Mobil's 1.7 percent decline. The Dow had come tantalizingly close to the milestone on Friday, hitting a peak of 19,999.63, as the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq also touched records after a late pop in tech stocks. "Our view about the Dow (hitting) 20,000 is not a matter of if, but a matter of when," said Matt Jones, U.S. head of equity strategy at J.P. Morgan Private Bank in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 76.42 points, or 0.38 percent, to 19,887.38, the S&P 500 had lost 8.08 points, or 0.354856 percent, to 2,268.9 and the Nasdaq Composite had added 10.76 points, or 0.19 percent, to 5,531.82. Eight of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were lower. The S&P's health sector was the biggest gainer with Merck & Co. the leading boost and Vertex Pharmaceuticals the biggest percentage gainer with a 4.4 pct jump after it issued guidance. Nasdaq's biggest drivers in the healthcare sector were Ariad Pharmaceuticals , which closed up 72.9 percent on a US$5.20 billion buyout deal with Japan's Takeda 4502.T Incyte with a 9.4 percent jump after it announced advancements in its cancer drug program with Merck. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.77-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.45-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 6 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 55 new highs and 16 new lows. About 6.4 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges on Monday compared with the 6.6 billion average for the last 20 sessions.

The energy sector dropped 1.4 percent as oil prices slid on concerns that rising Iraqi exports and U.S. output could dampen the impact of a deal among major producers to limit output. Two-thirds of the 30 Dow components were lower, with Exxon Mobil's 2.1 percent decline weighing the most, followed by a 1.3 percent drop in Chevron. The declines meant the Dow stayed shy of the psychologically significant 20,000 mark. It came tantalizingly close on Friday, hitting a record of 19,999.63, as the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq also touched records after a late pop in tech stocks. "Our view about the Dow (hitting) 20,000 is not a matter of if, but a matter of when," said Matt Jones, U.S. head of equity strategy at J.P. Morgan Private Bank in New York. At 12:28 p.m. ET (1728 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 48.65 points, or 0.24 percent, at 19,915.15, the S&P 500 was down 3.53 points, or 0.15 percent, at 2,273.45. The Nasdaq Composite was up 17.96 points, or 0.33 percent, at 5,539.01, easing slightly after hitting an all-time high of 5,539.14. Eight of the 11 major S&P sectors were lower. The tech sector was the top gainer. Apple , celebrating the tenth anniversary of the iPhone, rose 1.3 percent to a 13-month high of $119.43. "As we move into the next couple of weeks, the focus will move towards the micro and to specific company earnings and expectation going forward," Jones said. The first peek into how companies fared in the previous quarter will be provided later this week by big banks. S&P 500 companies overall are expected to post a 5.8 percent increase in profit in the quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The financial sector was however off 0.34 percent on Monday. Other big-name decliners were P&G and Coca-Cola , which dropped about 1 percent each after Goldman downgraded the stocks to "sell". The healthcare sector gained 0.34 percent, boosted by a string of multi-billion dollar deals. Pet hospital operator VCA jumped 28 percent after agreeing to a $7.7 billion buyout offer from candy and pet foods maker Mars Inc. Ariad Pharma surged nearly 73 percent on a $5.20 billion buyout deal with Japan's Takeda. Surgical Care Affiliates jumped 16 percent on a deal to be bought by UnitedHealth for about $2.30 billion. Dow component UnitedHealth dipped 0.6 percent. One dim spot in the sector was Celgene, which lost 1.1 percent after issuing a full-year revenue forecast that missed analysts' expectations. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,604 to 1,276. On the Nasdaq, 1,498 issues fell and 1,294 advanced. The S&P 500 index showed five new 52-week highs and no new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 47 new highs and 14 new lows.

Mars is buying the pet health care company VCA in a deal valued at around $7.7 billion. ORLIN WAGNER , THE ASSOCIATED PRESS This Wednesday, March 26, 2014, file photo, shows an entrance of a Mars Inc. production facility near Topeka, Kan. Mars is buying the pet health care company VCA in a deal valued at around $7.7 billion. ORLIN WAGNER , THE ASSOCIATED PRESS Facebook Twitter Email Comments PRINT SEND PDF Candy giant Mars Inc., facing a slowdown in packaged food, is making a bigger bet on a booming industry: pet care. The maker of M&Ms and Snickers agreed to buy the animal-hospital chain VCA Inc. for about $7.7 billion Monday -- not including debt -- expanding on its existing veterinary-care business. Mars will pay $93 a share in cash, a 31 percent premium to VCA’s closing price of $70.77 on Friday. The acquisition turns Mars into a dominant company in corporate-owned pet hospitals, an area that’s exploded in recent years -- helped by Americans treating their pets more like family members. It also could help bolster Mars’s current pet brands, including Pedigree and Whiskas. At a time when human food isn’t growing as quickly, the deal may make more sense for Mars than buying another snack business, said Ken Shea, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “They see growth and they see diversity,” he said. “Why double down on food when it’s not growing that fast?” The total value for the deal is about $9.1 billion, including $1.4 billion in outstanding debt. Shares of VCA, which trade under the ticker WOOF, surged as much as 29 percent to $91.03 on Monday after the transaction was announced. Closely held Mars had already been building out its pet business, including both food and hospital care. The company owns Banfield Pet Hospital and BluePearl Veterinary Partners, and it’s acquired pet-food brands from Procter & Gamble Co. VCA, meanwhile, operates almost 800 animal hospitals in the U.S. and Canada. The deal combines the top two veterinary hospital chains, but isn’t expected to run into regulatory challenges because it would represent less than 10 percent of the North American market, according to a research note from Stifel Nicolaus & Co. The deeper push into the pet business by Mars comes as large packaged-food companies are struggling with flagging sales. Changing consumer tastes, particularly a desire for less processed foods, has made it difficult for the companies that have dominated grocery-store shelves. Efforts to reduce sugar intake have struck an additional blow to candy makers such as Mars. That’s added pressure to diversify their portfolios. Spending on pets has surged in the U.S., fueled by the “humanization” of dogs and cats. Americans spent $35 billion on veterinary care in 2015. VCA, a pioneer in the field, has grown by buying up hundreds of veterinary hospitals -- an approach that’s now being adopted by rival companies. And with an expanding presence in animal hospitals, Mars will have an opportunity to use the facilities to sell more of its pet foods, according to Shea. “It’s a fast-growing industry and they obviously see an opportunity for that synergy,” he said. Mars, based in McLean, Va., expects the VCA deal to be completed in the third quarter.

Cramer said on "Squawk on the Street" the bank has "given us all she's got." "I mean, there's 12 companies that need to increase double digits in order to get back to where they were. Why do we keep asking Goldman to do so much? First of all, they don't even have Gary Cohn anymore. They don't even have a repeal of the Volcker Rule yet," Cramer said. Cohn is leaving Goldman to become President-elect Donald Trump's chief economic adviser. On Friday, the Dow rose about 65 points, with Goldman and Walt Disney contributing the most gains. The index also came within 0.37 points of hitting 20,000 for the first time. The Dow fell about 30 points in intraday trade on Monday, with ExxonMobil contributing the most losses. Separately, Goldman on Monday lowered its rating of Coca-Cola stock to "sell" from "neutral." It said the company's earnings results will come in below expectations in the coming year. It also downgraded Procter & Gamble. Cramer said it might have been the wrong time for the call. "Because interest rates are down big today. So, that's going to put pressure on the banks," Cramer said. "If we're trying to get to Dow 20,000, you may see on the tape in the bottom a lot of good things, but you lose Procter, you close Coca-Cola and you lose Goldman Sachs and you lose JPMorgan, you're not going to get where you need to go."

(© Tyler Olson/stock.adobe.com) BLOOMBERG NEWS 1/09/2017 Reprints Candy maker Mars solidified its leadership in pet care by announcing Monday it will acquire veterinary hospital company VCA (WOOF) for $9.1 billion. Mars will pay $93 a share in cash for VCA, and the total value for the deal includes $1.4 billion in outstanding debt, the companies said Monday in a statement. The deal is a 31% premium to VCA's closing price of $70.77 on Friday. Shares of VCA jumped 28.3% to close at 90.79 Monday. VCA operates almost 800 animal hospitals in the U.S. and Canada, according to the statement. Closely held Mars, the owner of brands like Pedigree and Whiskas, has been expanding its pet business, from food to hospitals. The company already owns Banfield Pet Hospital and BluePearl Veterinary Partners, and has acquired pet-food brands from Procter & Gamble (PG). Mars is now the top pet food maker in the U.S. The companies said they expect the deal to be completed in the third quarter. Morgan Stanley (MS) and BDT & Co. provided financial advice to Mars, while legal advisors included Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, Simpson Thacher & Bartlett and McDermott Will & Emery. Barclays advised VCA, and the company's legal advisors were Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld and Potter Anderson Corroon.

Stoddart formerly served dual roles as both global and North American CEO, but will now focus on the former role with the arrival of Swinand. Swinand will work closely with Leo Burnett North America CCO Judy John, Leo Burnett CCO and Publicis creative chairman Mark Tutssel and Stoddart, who will ensure a smooth transition, while reporting to Publicis North America CEO Andrew Bruce. Leo Burnett also acquired Swinand’s analytics software maker, Ardent IO and startup incubator The Abundancy. According to an internal memo from Publicis Worldwide CEO Arthur Sadoun, “sixty experts” from Ardent IO and The Abundancy will join the team at Leo Burnett Chicago later this month. “The new capabilities and talent we are adding will infuse Leo Burnett with deep data driven insights and predictive analytics which, combined with our world class creative, will enable the network to evolve HumanKind to be even more powerful and relevant,” he added.  “The challenge every brand faces is to get chosen. Thanks to our technology, it’s possible to predict what people want so that brands can respond with experiences that are truly meaningful,” Swinand said in a statement. “By combining our data-driven insights with Leo Burnett’s award-winning creative capabilities, we will make Leo Burnett’s HumanKind approach more powerful than ever before in helping our clients.” In addition to founding Ardent IO and The Abundancy, Swinand has also launched Transparent Media Partners in 2015 and Frequency540 in 2011. Beginning in 2000, he spent nearly eleven years as president of Starcom MediaVest Group, following three and a half years in brand management for Procter & Gamble and two and a half years as an account supervisor for BBDO. According to Sadoun, Publicis wants to strengthen the Leo Burnett organization after losing McDonald’s to Omnicom last year. Sadoun also told AdAge that the network plans to continue focusing on its relationship with General Motors no matter how the GMC review turns out. LB remains Buick’s AOR after parting with Detroit chief creative officer Steve Chavez, who had run all global GM work. According to our sources, an unnamed DigitasLBi executive has been running that pitch in Chavez’s absence. In the internal statement, Sadoun said, “Andrew is a digital innovator, creating modern tools, talent and capabilities for today’s marketplace and I truly believe in his ability to drive this transformation in North America for one of our biggest operations.” Here’s that statement in its entirety: Bonjour, First of all it’s not too late, let me wish a very happy new year to you and your family. I have some important news to share with you concerning one of our main creative networks, Leo Burnett. I’m very pleased to let you know that we have tapped industry leader and innovator Andrew Swinand to join Leo Burnett as North American CEO. Andrew is a truly respected and thoughtful leader and a familiar face to many of us within Publicis Groupe. He was our client on Secret at P&G and later led their first venture into e-commerce, before becoming president of Starcom MediaVest Group. Andrew is a digital innovator, creating modern tools, talent and capabilities for today’s marketplace and I truly believe in his ability to drive this transformation in North America for one of our biggest operations. Andrew will report to Andrew Bruce, CEO Publicis Communications North America and partner with Judy John, CCO Leo Burnett North America. He will also work very closely with Rich Stoddart, who as well as ensuring a smooth transition in North America, will focus on his global president role for Leo Burnett, supported by Mark Tutssel, CCO Leo Burnett & Creative Chairman Publicis Communications. One of Publicis Communication’s key goals is to reinforce our creative brands. We’re demonstrating this commitment to Leo Burnett, as coming with Andrew are two acquisitions that we are making to further strengthen and transform the network: The Abundancy and Ardent. Ardent provides proprietary technology that uses search to understand behaviour and predict consumer intent. The Abundancy applies these learnings to inform custom content. Together, the companies bring with them sixty experts who will join the teams at the Leo Burnett Chicago offices later this month. We’re making this move recognizing that we live in a time in which, thanks to technology, we can now predict what people want so brands can respond with relevant, value-adding experiences. The new capabilities and talent we are adding will infuse Leo Burnett with deep data driven insights and predictive analytics which, combined with our world class creative, will enable the network to evolve HumanKind to be even more powerful and relevant. As you know, throughout 2016 we worked to transform and future-proof Leo Burnett. We have made progress and achieved good results like the recent wins of Millers Coors and the global Jim Beam business, along with record performances at the Cannes Lions and being named agency of the year at the Clio Awards. But of course there is still work to be done, and with these additions to the team we’re equipping the network with all of the tools and talent it needs to accelerate on this dynamic. Voilà, I’m convinced that with the support of Andrew Bruce and through a great partnership with Rich, Andrew will bring to Leo Burnett North America the kind of competitive advantage the agency needs to reinforce its leadership on the market and deliver strong growth. I know you’ll all join me in welcoming Andrew and the teams from The Abundancy and Ardent and in supporting them as we work together to make 2017 a success for Leo Burnett North America and Publicis Communications as a whole.

Kristine Harjes (TMFAnchor) Jan 9, 2017 at 10:05AM Image source: Getty Images. From celebrity deaths to shocking political news, people found plenty to complain about in 2016. Me, though? I actually had a really good year. I met some incredible people, had unbelievable adventures, and learned a ton. In the financial realm, I saved responsibly (even given the crazy-high D.C. cost of living) and added quality companies to my stock portfolio. Indeed, I'd say I pretty fully met my 2016 resolution to diversify. My next challenge -- and my resolution for 2017 -- is to take a smarter approach to finding stocks to buy by creating a watchlist. A look in the rearview mirror Going into 2016, my portfolio was overweight in healthcare and largely packed with higher-risk growth stocks. I resolved to achieve more balance by finding stocks outside of healthcare and established, dividend-paying stocks. Overall, I think I did pretty well. Over the course of the year, in addition to adding to prior holdings, I opened positions in the following stocks: Johnson & Johnson, which is a profitable, fairly predictable dividend payer. Kinder Morgan, which gained roughly 65% by the end of the year and was paying out a 3.8% dividend at the time of my purchase. Apple, which was my first move in a Roth IRA, and thus my first tax-advantaged buy. It's also a stable company with a growing dividend. Wells Fargo, which I also sold for around the same price after my thesis -- largely based on corporate culture -- collapsed. Activision Blizzard, after an enlightening coffee chat with Foolish analyst Matt Argersinger, who convinced me that this stock is still in its infancy. Chipotle Mexican Grill, in an attempt to get in on a Fool favorite at what I thought to be a bargain price. Celldex, which now occupies a very tiny position in what I refer to as my "play" portfolio. I use this to open small positions in biotechs that excite me, but that I recognize are extremely risky. I do this mostly to hold myself accountable for my speculations. I'd give myself a B rating for following my 2016 resolution. I did diversify pretty nicely, but I'm still missing exposure to financials -- particularly since I talked a big game this time last year about getting exposure to this industry. While I did purchase Wells Fargo, I never found a replacement financials stock after I sold off my position. As I write this, healthcare is still the sector with the most representation in my holdings -- but it was narrowly trailed by consumer goods until two late-year healthcare pops reinflated that section of my portfolio. In any case, with the exception of the gaping hole of financials, the various sectors are much more evenly represented than they were going into the year. And in hindsight, this resolution was pretty wise, as my non-healthcare buys buffered the stinging biotech losses I suffered in 2016. (The broader industry, as measured by the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (NASDAQ: IBB), sank 19%.) My resolution for the year ahead Looking ahead to 2017, there's still more work for me to do before I feel adequately diversified. I need to up my game in energy and industrials, and, of course, re-enter the financials space. This year, though, my resolution goes a step beyond just buying in: I'm going to resolve to be more analytical about when I buy. Specifically, I'm going to make a watchlist. In the past, my buying went something like this: A company crosses my mind as intriguing. I do a bunch of research on it: talk to Foolish analysts, read up on fool.com articles, print out a few conference calls to read. If I still like it after doing my due diligence, I buy it right away. I'd like to improve upon this process by forcing myself to be patient. I want to do my research ahead of time and come up with a list of companies that I like, along with the prices at which I'd buy in. Now, let me be very clear that I'm in no way using this list to try and time the market. I simply think I should have my research already done on a sizable list of intriguing companies before a buying opportunity presents itself. In particular, I'm looking to fill this list out with blue-chip Fool favorites like Coca-Cola, Procter and Gamble, General Motors, Chevron, Verizon Communications, and Microsoft. I know relatively little about the inner workings of these businesses, but I owe it to myself to do some research and figure out what I think is an attractive price for each of them. While I'm at it, I'm going to summarize my buy thesis for each, as well as some areas to watch. This organized, systematic approach takes some of the emotion out of investing, which is a huge advantage. When a stock hits my target price, and assuming nothing has changed about the business, I'll know I want to pick up shares for great reasons, rather than being temporarily excited about a company I just researched. Who knows what 2017 will bring, but I feel confident that building a watchlist will be the best financial move I can make.

Mars, which owns the Whiskas and Pedigree pet food brands, has been expanding into the veterinary sector in recent years. It already owns Banfield Pet Hospital, which runs more than 900 clinics and animal hospitals in the US and Puerto Rico, and BluePearl Veterinary Partners, another US-based group. VCA will add huge scale to Mars’ pet care division. The Los Angeles-based company was founded in 1986 and has grown from running one facility to nearly 800 animal hospitals in the US and Canada and 60 diagnostic laboratories. It generated annual sales of $2.13bn in 2015. Mars, a privately owned company, will pay $93 a share in cash for VCA. The total value of the deal also includes $1.4bn in debt. The price reflects a 31pc premium to VCA’s closing value of $70.77 on Friday, and news of the deal sent shares in the listed company soaring 28pc to $90.76. Mars, which owns many well-known sweet brands including Maltesers and Celebrations, has been in the business of pet care for 80 years and became the top pet food maker in 2014, after buying Procter & Gamble’s pet foods business, known for brands such as Iams and Natura, for $2.9bn. Rival Nestlé, the maker of Purina pet products, is the world's second-biggest pet food maker, according to data from Euromonitor. Mars also owns the upmarket Royal Canin pet food brand and has a growing business in pet DNA testing and pet technology. “We are thrilled to welcome VCA to the Mars family,” said Grant Reid, chief executive of Mars. “The opportunity we see together for pets, pet owners, veterinarians and other pet care providers is tremendous.” The acquisition is expected to complete in the third quarter of the year. VCA will remain a separate business unit within Mars Petcare once the transaction is finalised. Morgan Stanley and BDT provided financial advice to Mars, while Barclays advised VCA. The deal still needs approval from VCA shareholders.

Chipotle Mexican Grill, in an attempt to get in on a Fool favorite at what I thought to be a bargain price. Celldex, which now occupies a very tiny position in what I refer to as my "play" portfolio. I use this to open small positions in biotechs that excite me, but that I recognize are extremely risky. I do this mostly to hold myself accountable for my speculations. I'd give myself a B rating for following my 2016 resolution. I did diversify pretty nicely, but I'm still missing exposure to financials -- particularly since I talked a big game this time last year about getting exposure to this industry. While I did purchase Wells Fargo, I never found a replacement financials stock after I sold off my position. As I write this, healthcare is still the sector with the most representation in my holdings -- but it was narrowly trailed by consumer goods until two late-year healthcare pops reinflated that section of my portfolio. In any case, with the exception of the gaping hole of financials, the various sectors are much more evenly represented than they were going into the year. And in hindsight, this resolution was pretty wise, as my non-healthcare buys buffered the stinging biotech losses I suffered in 2016. (The broader industry, as measured by the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (NASDAQ: IBB), sank 19%.) My resolution for the year ahead Looking ahead to 2017, there's still more work for me to do before I feel adequately diversified. I need to up my game in energy and industrials, and, of course, re-enter the financials space. This year, though, my resolution goes a step beyond just buying in: I'm going to resolve to be more analytical about when I buy. Specifically, I'm going to make a watchlist. In the past, my buying went something like this: A company crosses my mind as intriguing. I do a bunch of research on it: talk to Foolish analysts, read up on fool.com articles, print out a few conference calls to read. If I still like it after doing my due diligence, I buy it right away. I'd like to improve upon this process by forcing myself to be patient. I want to do my research ahead of time and come up with a list of companies that I like, along with the prices at which I'd buy in. Now, let me be very clear that I'm in no way using this list to try and time the market. I simply think I should have my research already done on a sizable list of intriguing companies before a buying opportunity presents itself. In particular, I'm looking to fill this list out with blue-chip Fool favorites like Coca-Cola, Procter and Gamble, General Motors, Chevron, Verizon Communications, and Microsoft. I know relatively little about the inner workings of these businesses, but I owe it to myself to do some research and figure out what I think is an attractive price for each of them. While I'm at it, I'm going to summarize my buy thesis for each, as well as some areas to watch. This organized, systematic approach takes some of the emotion out of investing, which is a huge advantage. When a stock hits my target price, and assuming nothing has changed about the business, I'll know I want to pick up shares for great reasons, rather than being temporarily excited about a company I just researched. Who knows what 2017 will bring, but I feel confident that building a watchlist will be the best financial move I can make.

The maker of M&Ms and Snickers agreed to buy the animal-hospital chain VCA Inc. for about $7.7 billion on Monday -- not including debt -- expanding on its existing veterinary-care business. Mars will pay $93 a share in cash, a 31 percent premium to VCA’s closing price of $70.77 on Friday. The acquisition turns Mars into a dominant company in corporate-owned pet hospitals, an area that’s exploded in recent years -- helped by Americans treating their pets more like family members. It also could help bolster Mars’s current pet brands, including Pedigree and Whiskas. At a time when human food isn’t growing as quickly, the deal may make more sense for Mars than buying another snack business, said Ken Shea, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “They see growth and they see diversity,” he said. “Why double down on food when it’s not growing that fast?” The total value for the deal is about $9.1 billion, including $1.4 billion in outstanding debt. Shares of VCA, which trade under the ticker WOOF, surged as much as 29 percent to $91.03 on Monday after the transaction was announced. Closely held Mars had already been building out its pet business, including both food and hospital care. The company owns Banfield Pet Hospital and BluePearl Veterinary Partners, and it’s acquired pet-food brands from Procter & Gamble Co. VCA, meanwhile, operates almost 800 animal hospitals in the U.S. and Canada. The deal combines the top two veterinary hospital chains, but isn’t expected to run into regulatory challenges because it would represent less than 10 percent of the North American market, according to a research note from Stifel Nicolaus & Co.

You will now receive the Game Plan newsletter The deeper push into the pet business by Mars comes as large packaged-food companies are struggling with flagging sales. Changing consumer tastes, particularly a desire for less processed foods, has made it difficult for the companies that have dominated grocery-store shelves. Efforts to reduce sugar intake have struck an additional blow to candy makers such as Mars. That’s added pressure to diversify their portfolios. Spending on pets has surged in the U.S., fueled by the “humanization” of dogs and cats. Americans spent $35 billion on veterinary care in 2015. VCA, a pioneer in the field, has grown by buying up hundreds of veterinary hospitals -- an approach that’s now being adopted by rival companies. And with an expanding presence in animal hospitals, Mars will have an opportunity to use the facilities to sell more of its pet foods, according to Shea. “It’s a fast-growing industry and they obviously see an opportunity for that synergy,” he said.

Morgan Stanley and BDT & Co. provided financial advice to Mars, while legal advisers included Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP and McDermott Will & Emery LLP. Barclays Plc advised VCA, and the company’s legal advisers were Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld LLP and Potter Anderson Corroon LLP. “VCA is a leader across pet health care and the opportunity we see together -- for pets, pet owners, veterinarians and other pet-care providers -- is tremendous,” Mars Chief Executive Officer Grant Reid said in a statement.

It comes at a time when we have the prospect of a fourth Industrial Revolution, an age of automation, artificial intelligence and robotics. It also brings back memories of how I got to know about Louis Kelso, who wanted to make a capitalist out of every American. In the 1970s, I was a bill-drafter in the state Legislature. One of the Assemblymen I drafted for was Dan Haley, who was a Democrat from the Republican North Country. Haley was a supporter of the ideas of Kelso, who co-wrote with Mortimer Adler the "Capitalist Manifesto." Its main idea was to spread America's wealth through a plan of Employee Stock Ownership Plans known as ESOPs. Haley had me drafting some ESOP laws, and Congress endorsed Kelso's brainchild, making it a national law. Economic conditions for the poor and middle class are worse today than when I learned about Kelso. In his book, he wrote that the concentration of wealth in the United States, which was in the top 5 percent about 50 years ago, is as great as Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels found in Europe when they wrote "The Communist Manifesto." Now wealth is concentrated in the top 1 percent of the population. According to Kelso, those with wealth "can't spend enough. They only spend for it for the wrong thing: accumulating more excess." Therefore, the 99 percent of the population depends to a greater or lesser extent on redistribution. Kelso believes "the wars and war production have been an indispensable part of making this plutocratic economy work." Kelso's answer was a national economic policy combining full employment with capital ownership. He invented the first ESOP in 1956, when the employees of Peninsula Newspapers bought out the company founders. Congress enacted a tax policy for ESOPs called the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). It attracted both Democratic and Republican leaders. Kelso was interviewed by Bill Moyers in 1990 and Moyers said at that time that, "I know as a reporter that there's a widespread perception in the country that something is fundamentally and dangerously wrong with our economic structure. Our debt has tripled in the last 10 years, there are 32 million people living in poverty, 12 million of those live with less than $5,000 a year. It's harder and harder for even two spouses in the same family to do for their children what one spouse did with one. ..." Many corporations like Avis, Proctor & Gamble, JCPenney and Anheuser-Busch have tried ESOPs. Some plans have worked and others haven't, for various reasons, but by the end of the 1980s an estimated 10 million workers belonged to ESOPs. Moyers made the point that he had seen one team of management after another subvert Kelso's idea to protect their interests. They would share the stock, but not democracy; they would not share participation with employees who own stock through ESOPs. The conversation between Moyers and Kelso ended with Moyers saying capitalizing the middle- and lower-class workers won't work, because "the capitalist is a tiger." Kelso responds by saying, "he is not the only tiger in the jungle, and the hungry tigers are going to beat the greedy tigers every time, especially when they outnumber them 95 to 5." We have seen the contest between the greedy wealthy and the declining middle and lower class go on for decades, and the election of Trump is an example of the power of the wealthy to control our democracy. The sad thing is that we don't look behind the screen, so that a plurality of the voters know what needs to be done to have the political democracy act to even the odds. Paul M.

Daniel Patrick HANNON 1939 - 2017 Obituary Condolences Gallery Flowers HANNON, Daniel Patrick 77, loving husband to Chris, father, grandfather, brother, uncle, Santa, coach, and friend to all who graced his path, was lifted high, surrounded in love and light by his family on January 5, 2017 at the family home in Reily, Ohio. Born on July 27, 1939 to Christopher Francis (d) and Eva Catherine (d) (Hemioben) Hannon in Cincinnati, Ohio, Dan was the family patriarch and oldest brother to Tom, Mary, and Marjorie (d) and two half siblings, James (d) and Charlotte (d). A proud 1957 graduate of North College Hill High School, where he excelled at all sports, drama, honor society and was class president, Dan was swept off his feet and married Christine Ann (Seithel) Hannon on October 7, 1961 for a wonderful 55 years. Dan's family grew and grew over the years. He had a wonderful relationship with Chris's six sisters and three brothers and was the apple of his mother in-law Betty Lou's (d) eye. Dan's greatest accomplishment, his pride and joy were his seven children, their families and twelve grandchildren: Son, Patrick & Judy (Williams) Hannon - Sean and Samantha; Son, Timothy & Rhonda (Farrow) Hannon - Rebecca and Emily; Daughter, Elizabeth Hannon & Ty Manzo Andrew; Son, David & Kelly Hannon - Sara (Hannon) & Jonathan Jordan, Ryan and Kody; Daughter, Jeanne Hannon - Alex and Daniel Ross; Son, Paul & Melissa (Sizer) Hannon - Layla and Christopher; Son, Steven Hannon Snarf. Dan worked for 35 years at Proctor & Gamble's Miami Valley Labs making major contributions to the field of dermatohistopathology and the advancement of electron microscopy. His love of sports was prolific. In 2004 his children, on behalf of more than 400 children he coached, mentored or befriended, dedicated a plaque to the baseball complex at Reily School. It reads, "Coach Daniel P. Hannon, His love of children and baseball compelled him into service as a coach for over 30 years. He, with the help from family and friends, was instrumental in refurbishing this ball diamond and in reforming the Reily Baseball/Softball League in 1973." Dan was a master chess player and refereed high school football for 25 years, and served as the PTA and Booster president for decades. His legacy will live on each time an area child laces up their cleats, picks up a glove or tosses a football, as each ref blows her whistle and in every mother or father that smiles as their child makes a friend or treats another as they are the most special person in the world. That is how Dan treated everyone, with love, recognizing their humanity and potential. Because of his natural ability to inspire this greatness in everyone, to many, he is one of the greatest men to walk the earth. Please join the family on Monday January 9th in celebration and bereavement: Visitation - Ogle & Paul R. Young Funeral Home in Oxford 10AM-2PM; Celebration of Life Service - Kumler Chapel, Miami University, 3-4 PM; Memorial Gathering - Reily Community Center, 6096 Reily Millville Rd, 5-8PM In lieu of flowers please send a donation to the Hannon Family Charitable Fund at any US Bank or by mail to the Oxford Branch, 1 Lynn Avenue, Oxford, Ohio 45056.

X European stocks slip as Britain’s FTSE powers ahead on weaker pound Sterling weakens on comments by May on post-Brexit trade Mon, Jan 9, 2017, 19:11 Eoin Burke-Kennedy The FTSE 100 rose 0.4 per cent on Monday after hitting an all-time high of 7,243.76 points in its 10th straight session of gain. Photograph: Lauren Hurley/PA         European shares slipped on Monday as a pullback in bank stocks more than offset a stronger tech sector, while a drop in the pound drove Britain’s FTSE 100 index to further record highs. The pan-European Stoxx index slid 0.4 per cent, while the FTSE 100 rose 0.4 per cent after hitting an all-time high of 7,243.76 points in its 10th straight session of gains. The pound sank to more than two-month lows after weekend comments from British prime minister Theresa May sparked talk that Britain would drastically rework trade relations with the European Union after Brexit. “Domestic populist politics trumps the trade card for now, it seems, and that is weighing on the pound, whilst simultaneously giving another boost to the FTSE 100,” Neil Wilson, a senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said in a note. DUBLIN The Iseq was marginally down at 6,574, roughly tracking movements elsewhere in Europe. Tullow Oil ended the day flat at €3.83 after being down 3.5 per cent at one stage, following the news that it had agreed to sell a stake in a Ugandan oil project for €851 million to French group Total. The group’s shares rose 2.7 per cent in London, to £3.336. Bank of Ireland was down 2 per cent at 24.8 cents amid a wider downturn in European financials. Ryanair was also weaker, trading down 1 per cent at €14.62 after a strong week last week. Building materials giant CRH also tracked the weaker global trend to end the day down marginally at €32.05. In contrast, food firms Glanbia and Kerry traded up 2.3 per cent and 1.7 per cent respectively at €16.28 and €69.29, albeit on thin trading volumes. LONDON Britain’s blue-chip index broke fresh records on Monday, pushed up by rallying resource stocks and a weak sterling. The FTSE 100 touched a new record high of 7,243.76 points, then settled at 7,237.77 points, up 0.4 per cent, for the close. It chalked up its 10th straight daily session of gains. ADVERTISEMENT The index tends to gain as sterling drops, due to a large number of dollar-earning constituents. The pound slid more than 1 per cent to a ten-week low against the dollar after comments over the weekend from Theresa May reignited fears of a “hard Brexit”. Strong performance in basic resources and consumer stocks also underpinned the index. Glencore, Randgold Resources and BHP Billiton were among the top gainers as gold and silver prices rebounded. Glencore led the FTSE, closing up 3.6 per cent, supported by a note by Barclays reiterating its “overweight” rating and increasing its target price on the stock. Cigarette sellers British American Tobacco and Imperial Brands were third and fourth top gainers, leading the consumer goods sector higher. Outsourcing company Capita was the top faller, followed by Land Securities Group and Royal Bank of Scotland which, along with the vast majority of European banks, tracked lower. EUROPE Germany’s Fresenius Medical fell 6.8 per cent, making it the biggest loser on the pan-European Stoxx index, after it and US rival DaVita received subpoenas from federal prosecutors investigating their ties with a charity that helps patients pay for kidney dialysis. Among the biggest weights to the Stoxx were also oil majors Royal Dutch Shell and Total. Oil prices fell sharply as signs that growing US production and record Iraqi exports had raised concerns that additional output would weigh on the market. Among top gainers, French retailer Casino Guichard rose 3 per cent after an upgrade from Bank of America Merrill Lynch, citing a simplification of the group’s corporate structure as a positive for the stock. Tech stocks rose 0.7 per cent after an upbeat note from Citi, which expects the sector to have another bright year, citing appealing fundamentals and earnings prospects. SAP rose 0.8 per cent to a fresh 22-year high after UBS said a survey of customers of the German software maker suggested that the company had room to lift its mid-term goals when it reports results late this month. German car-maker Volkswagen rose 4.9 per cent with traders citing hopes a deal to resolve the US diesel emissions scandal could be close. NEW YORK Declines in bank and energy companies weighed on Wall Street, distancing the Dow from the 20,000 mark, while gains in technology stocks pushed the Nasdaq to a record intraday high. Two-thirds of the 30 Dow components were lower, with Goldman Sachs’s 0.7 per cent decline weighing the most. P&G and Coca-Cola dropped 0.9 per cent after Goldman downgraded both the consumer staple stocks. Apple, which is celebrating the 10th anniversary of the iPhone, was up 1.1 per cent at $119.14, after hitting a 13-month high of $119.30. A string of multibillion dollar healthcare deals boost the sector on Monday. Ariad Pharma surged nearly 73 per cent on a $5.2 billion takeout by Japan’s Takeda. Pet hospital operator VCA jumped 28 per cent after Mars said it would buy the company for $7.7 billion. – (Additional reporting by Reuters/Bloomberg)       Topics: Eoin Burke Kennedy European Merrill Lynch Neil Wilson Theresa May European Union Pet Hospital American Tobacco Apple Ariad BHP Billiton Bank of America Bank of Ireland Barclays Bloomberg CRH Capita Group Casino Guichard Coca Cola DaVita ETX Fresenius Glanbia Glencore Goldman Sachs Group Imperial Brands Kerry Group Land Securities Group Randgold Resources Royal Bank of Scotland Royal Dutch Shell Ryanair SAP Takeda Total Tullow Oil UBS Vca Volkswagen AG County Kerry Dublin(IE) Europe Germany Japan London(GB) New York City United Kingdom United States Read More Sterling drops as May signals UK heading for ‘hard Brexit’ Oil halts its advance below $54 a barrel Exuberant markets may not be factoring Trump risks European stocks rally following US jobs report Asian shares rise as US interest rates ease Yuan set for big weekly gain as China bears down on speculators FTSE hits sixth consecutive all-time high World stocks hit 18-month high after strong China data Euro zone government bond yields edge back down due to US uncertainty Early new year rally ends for Euro stocks as oil markets rise Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Economy Oxfam report reveals ‘obscene’ gap between rich and poor Retail & Services Irish retailers angry as State leaves them out in the cold Rugby Ulster unable to build on start as Exeter end European adventure Economy Merkel warns of risks posed by rising protectionism Sponsored Plan your financial future and enjoy your dream retirement Leading the dance: 'Growing up competing I learned the drive to keep going' Redbreast Lustau: an old friend with a new whiskey perspective Making a difficult fertility journey a lot less lonely ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Funds Tracker Keep up to date with your investments   Latest Business New orders drive recovery in construction, latest data shows 01:00 Oxfam report reveals ‘obscene’ gap between rich and poor 00:02 Facebook Germany to start tackling fake news within weeks 19:28 Seen & Heard: Silver lining for Apollo House activists? 19:10 For your diary 19:00 ADVERTISEMENT Most Read in Business 1 40 houses owned by Irish EuroMillions family seized 2 We could be looking at ‘hard Brexit’.
