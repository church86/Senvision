Innovation is helping, but P&G's slimmed-down product portfolio is playing the biggest role in its rebound. Demitrios Kalogeropoulos (TMFSigma) Feb 4, 2017 at 1:45PM Image source: Getty Images. Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) shareholders received good news on the sales front recently as the company hiked its full-year outlook following two consecutive quarters of surprising gains. Sure, the boost just pushed the growth target slightly higher than the 2% prior goal. Yet it marked the first time in over two years that P&G has increased its annual outlook. And if it meets the raised goal, the consumer goods titan will likely outpace rivals including Kimberly-Clark (NYSE:KMB) while ending its three-year long market share slide. Better portfolio The main contributor to the improving growth trend is P&G's new portfolio. It recently finished a brand-shedding initiative that removed 100 product lines, including several big brands like Duracell, from the business. When they started this process, executives said they wanted to simplify the operations by removing less-desirable franchises so that the remaining portfolio, led by global share leaders like Tide and Gillette, would be both easier to manage and more profitable. Two quarters into fiscal 2017, and there's evidence the plan is working. Organic sales rose by roughly 2.5% over the last six months, putting the company ahead of its earlier target. "We said the new portfolio would grow up to 1 [percentage] point faster and over the first two quarters of this fiscal year, we're seeing this play out," Chief Financial Officer Jon Moeller explained to investors. BT = Before tax. Image source: P&G investor presentation. Looking deeper into the metrics, investors can find more reasons why executives are gaining confidence in the sales trends. For example, P&G's organic growth was driven by higher volumes across each of its categories while pricing played just a small role. That result stood in contrast with Kimberly-Clark, whose Huggies diaper franchise competes against P&G's Pampers brand. Kimberly-Clark's volume gains slowed last quarter as management cited a "challenging economic and competitive environment." Can P&G keep it up? P&G is leaning on marketing and innovation improvements to keep the positive momentum going. On the innovation side, it's pushing a relentless pace of upgrades in brands like Tide Pods, whose premium category has quickly passed $2 billion in annual sales. A new version that includes Downy fabric softener is a good example of that process. But while innovations can take a while to build up demand, marketing is another story. As the world's biggest advertiser, P&G knows how to spur consumer interest, and that's why it is dedicating a larger portion of sales to supporting its brands right now. Management is also aiming to keep that spending steadier than in the past so that sales growth within brands doesn't swing as wildly from quarter to quarter. Some of the most encouraging progress on the marketing front has been P&G's sampling program that's getting millions of products, especially Pampers diapers, Gillette razor blades, and Tide detergents, into the hands of consumers when they most need them. The ramped-up program is in its early stages, but management is encouraged enough by the results that it is doubling down on it in hopes of creating loyal customers through targeted trial products. Sales are weighted toward the second half of P&G's fiscal year, and so it's too early to say whether organic growth is really on a sustainable rebound. Moeller admitted as much last month, telling investors, "We still have a lot to prove [and] we still have a lot of work to do." Yet "so far," he continued, "it is progressing in the direction we had hoped." In fact, if things continue at this pace, P&G will grow organic sales by as much as 3% this year as volume rises. That would mark a sharp improvement over 2016's 1% uptick that occurred amid falling sales volumes. Demitrios Kalogeropoulos has no position in any stocks mentioned.

This year, they will also suggest how to keep tidy after the event is over. Procter & Gamble, one of the nation’s biggest manufacturers of consumer products like Pampers, Crest, and Dawn, is adding quite the clean-up crew to the Super Bowl ad roster. Fans who watch Super Bowl LI this Sunday will see spots for the company’s Tide detergent, Febreze air freshener and Mr. Clean cleaning products. For the Cincinnati company, the presence is oversized: Super Bowl LI will mark the only time Procter & Gamble has run more than a single national ad in the Big Game since first dipping its toe into Super Bowl ad waters in 2004. And the move makes Procter one of the event’s bigger sponsors this year, on par with Pepsi or Fiat Chrysler. Why is the maker of Bounty backing what might be called a triple-ply presence? Its move is emblematic of what media buyers and TV sales executives say has been a pronounced shift of ad spending in the last year. Consumer packaged goods companies –historically some of the biggest ad spenders on TV – have in recent years earmarked some of that money for digital outlets in a bid to keep pace with consumers testing out emerging venues like streaming video or mobile tablets.  Over the last year, however, the sector has reversed course, and returned some of the money to TV. Marc Pritchard, P&G’s chief brand officer, has in recent months been quite public about his desire to prioritize reach, or getting its marketing messages in front of masses of consumers. TV often provides a good means of attaining that goal. Related How TV Tuned in More Upfront Ad Dollars: Soap, Toothpaste and Pushy Tactics The Super Bowl ad ranks contain fewer makers of pharmaceuticals and automobiles, noted Bruce Lefkowitz, executive vice president of ad sales for Fox Networks Group, in an interview. But he said he has noticed a surge of interest from consumer-packaged goods companies. “They are starting to see the scale and attention they get at the Super Bowl are unsurpassed, and it comes on the heels of last year’s upfront, when you saw a migration by consumer packaged goods companies from the digital world back into television,” he said. In the “upfront,” TV networks try to sell the bulk of their ad inventory for the coming program season. P&G has advertised Tide in past Super Bowls, but Mr. Clean and Febreze are making their debut. Tide, which has gained notice in previous editions of the gridiron classic with a 2008 ad featuring a talking stain, is expected to run an ad centered around football player Rob Gronkowski and actor Jeffrey Tambor. Febreze will highlight its new “OdorClear” technology which tackles  odors in the air and  surfaces. Mr. Clean will turn its bald-headed mascot into something of a romantic foil. Despite its decades of TV advertising, Procter is a relatively young Super Bowl sponsor. It first aligned itself with the Super Bowl in 2004, when it held an internal contest among six of its brands to see which one should get a Super Bowl commercial. The winner that year was Charmin. Since that time, P&G has taken to the football championship four other times. It placed Gillette on the field in 2006; ran ads for Tide in 2008 and 2013; and launched a commercial for Always in 2015.

(Photo: Mercedes-Benz USA via AP) 10 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE NEW YORK - Super Bowl advertisers are treading carefully this year to avoid alienating customers as a divisive political climate takes some of the buzz away from what is usually the biggest spectacle on TV. Ad critic Barbara Lippert says that while “people need an escape,” like the Super Bowl, this year’s matchup on the field feels “so much less important than what’s going on politically.” To get the attention back, some advertisers are turning to nostalgia, celebrities and marketing stunts. P&G is sexing up Mr. Clean, Honda is featuring nine celebrities and Snickers is running a live ad. Others are touching on social issues, without being too blunt about it. Budweiser won the pre-game buzz with a sweeping cinematic ad showcasing founder Adolphus Busch’s 1857 immigration from Germany to St. Louis. Although it has been in the works since May, the ad felt topical, as it was released online just days after President Donald Trump’s travel ban against people from seven Muslim-majority countries. The ad got more than 8 million views on YouTube in just four days. RELATED: Watch all the 2017 Super Bowl ads that are already released Although many brands released ads online ahead of time, there will still be surprises during Fox’s Super Bowl broadcast Sunday. At $5 million for a 30-second spot, and an expected U.S. audience of more than 110 million, the pressure is on. Tiptoeing around politics Audi’s spot addresses gender equality as a man muses about his daughter receiving equal pay as men one day. Construction company 84 Lumber had to revise its original ad because a scene featuring a border wall was deemed too controversial by Fox. The new ad shows a Mexican woman and her daughter making a trip by foot across Mexico. The ad’s ending will be revealed at halftime at journey84.com; the website suggests excised footage will be shown. And Kia attempts a humorous approach. In an ad for the Niro car, Melissa McCarthy takes on political causes like saving whales, ice caps and trees, each time to disastrous effect. The message: “It’s hard to be an eco-warrior, but it’s easy to drive like one” with a fuel-efficient Niro. Though advertisers are being extra careful, taking on any sort of political topic might backfire, says Mark DiMassimo, CEO of ad agency DiMassimo Goldstein. Against the backdrop of an “emboldened, enraged or traumatized audience,” he says, themes that might have been innocuous in the past “seem more strident and jarring this year.” Stuffed with celebrities In turbulent times, brands can count on celebrities to ensure goodwill among consumers. And why use one celebrity when you can have many? In Honda’s ad, the high-school yearbook photos of Amy Adams, Steve Carell, Viola Davis, Missy Elliott, Tina Fey, Magic Johnson, Jimmy Kimmel, Stan Lee and Robert Redford come to life with special effects. The animations encourage people to follow their dreams in a nod to Honda’s longtime slogan, “The Power of Dreams.” Website hosting company Squarespace shows an intense John Malkovich berating the owner of johnmalkovich.com domain name. Justin Bieber shows off dance moves to tout T-Mobile cellphone offerings. For the baby boomer crowd, Mercedes-Benz shows a biker gang being amazed by Peter Fonda’s AMG GT roadster to the tune of Steppenwolf’s “Born to be Wild.” “The proliferation of athletes and more personalities is a reflection of not taking too much risk,” says Kelly O’Keefe from Virginia Commonwealth University’s advertising graduate program. “When in doubt get a personality.” Blast from the past Anheuser-Busch joins Mercedes-Benz in trying to reach consumers with nostalgia. The brewer’s ad shows a mountain man opening a can of Busch beer to the sound of “Buschhhhh.” It’s a nod to the brand’s ad campaign, introduced in 1978, which lasted for decades. Meanwhile, Bud Light is bringing back the ghost of its 1980s spokesdog Spuds Mackenzie — literally. In its ad, the dog appears as a ghost dangling in the air, urging a Bud Light drinker to go out and join his friends, like the ghosts in the holiday classic “A Christmas Carol.” And P&G sexes up its Mr. Clean mascot, introduced as an animated character in 1958. In the new ad, he distracts a woman as he cleans her kitchen. “Emotions are the secret sauce of getting people to do things, and nostalgia is a great reason for people to pay attention,” says Devra Prywes of video analytics firm Unruly. Here's to health After 10 years, Frito-Lay has retired its “Crash the Super Bowl” campaign for Doritos. Those ads, created by consumers, were usually filled with slapstick humor. Taking its place? A healthier approach. PepsiCo is featuring its new bottled water called LifeWTR and its sugar-free soft drink, Pepsi Zero Sugar. Bai Brands investor Justin Timberlake helps promote the company’s antioxidant-infused drinks. And one of Wonderful Co.’s 15-second ads promotes the health benefits of its pistachios. Avocados from Mexico is focusing on its “healthy fats” in a humorous ad showing a secret society subliminally influenced by Jon Lovitz to chow down on guacamole. Surprises The biggest buzz may come from what hasn’t been revealed ahead of time. Snickers’ ad with Adam Driver and a “Wild West” theme will be performed live during the third quarter. Hyundai tapped “Deepwater Horizon” director Peter Berg to shoot an ad during the game itself for airing right after the game ends. Chrysler, long known for its surprise two-minute ads starring celebrities like Eminem and Clint Eastwood, won’t even say whether it’s advertising this year. Coca-Cola says it bought two spots, but it’s keeping the topic a mystery. “Ultimately, the advertiser who gives us sweet relief without that aftertaste is going to win,” DiMassimo says. “Something simple, delightful and cheerful.” 10 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://on.jsonl.in/2l0zDgw NEVER MISS OUT Managing Your Money Master your money with the latest business and investment news, articles and tips from financial experts each Friday.

(Mercedes-Benz USA via AP) NEW YORK (AP) — Super Bowl advertisers are treading carefully this year to avoid alienating customers as a divisive political climate takes some of the buzz away from what is usually the biggest spectacle on TV. Ad critic Barbara Lippert says that while "people need an escape," like the Super Bowl, this year's matchup on the field feels "so much less important than what's going on politically." To get the attention back, some advertisers are turning to nostalgia, celebrities and marketing stunts. P&G is sexing up Mr. Clean, Honda is featuring nine celebrities and Snickers is running a live ad. Others are touching on social issues, without being too blunt about it. Budweiser won the pre-game buzz with a sweeping cinematic ad showcasing founder Adolphus Busch's 1857 immigration from Germany to St. Louis. Although it has been in the works since May , the ad felt topical, as it was released online just days after President Donald Trump's travel ban against people from seven Muslim-majority countries. The ad got more than 8 million views on YouTube in just four days. Although many brands released ads online ahead of time, there will still be surprises during Fox's Super Bowl broadcast Sunday. At $5 million for a 30-second spot, and an expected U.S. audience of more than 110 million, the pressure is on. TIPTOEING AROUND POLITICS Audi's spot addresses gender equality as a man muses about his daughter receiving equal pay as men one day. Building supplies retailer 84 Lumber had to revise its original ad because a scene featuring a border wall was deemed too controversial by Fox. The new ad shows a Mexican woman and her daughter making a trip by foot across Mexico. The ad's ending will be revealed at halftime at http://journey84.com ; the website suggests excised footage will be shown. And Kia attempts a humorous approach. In an ad for the Niro car, Melissa McCarthy takes on political causes like saving whales, ice caps and trees, each time to disastrous effect. The message: "It's hard to be an eco-warrior, but it's easy to drive like one" with a fuel-efficient Niro. Though advertisers are being extra careful, taking on any sort of political topic might backfire, says Mark DiMassimo, CEO of ad agency DiMassimo Goldstein. Against the backdrop of an "emboldened, enraged or traumatized audience," he says, themes that might have been innocuous in the past "seem more strident and jarring this year." STUFFED WITH CELEBRITIES In turbulent times, brands can count on celebrities to ensure goodwill among consumers. And why use one celebrity when you can have many? In Honda's ad , the high-school yearbook photos of Amy Adams, Steve Carell, Viola Davis, Missy Elliott, Tina Fey, Magic Johnson, Jimmy Kimmel, Stan Lee and Robert Redford come to life with special effects. The animations encourage people to follow their dreams in a nod to Honda's longtime slogan, "The Power of Dreams." Website hosting company Squarespace shows an intense John Malkovich berating the owner of johnmalkovich.com domain name. Justin Bieber shows off dance moves to tout T-Mobile cellphone offerings. For the baby boomer crowd, Mercedes-Benz shows a biker gang being amazed by Peter Fonda's AMG GT roadster to the tune of Steppenwolf's "Born to be Wild." "The proliferation of athletes and more personalities is a reflection of not taking too much risk," says Kelly O'Keefe from Virginia Commonwealth University's advertising graduate program. "When in doubt get a personality." BLAST FROM THE PAST Anheuser-Busch joins Mercedes-Benz in trying to reach consumers with nostalgia. The brewer's ad shows a mountain man opening a can of Busch beer to the sound of "Buschhhhh." It's a nod to the brand's ad campaign, introduced in 1978, which lasted for decades. Meanwhile, Bud Light is bringing back the ghost of its 1980s spokesdog Spuds Mackenzie — literally. In its ad, the dog appears as a ghost dangling in the air, urging a Bud Light drinker to go out and join his friends, like the ghosts in the holiday classic "A Christmas Carol." And P&G sexes up its Mr. Clean mascot, introduced as an animated character in 1958. In the new ad , he distracts a woman as he cleans her kitchen. "Emotions are the secret sauce of getting people to do things, and nostalgia is a great reason for people to pay attention," says Devra Prywes of video analytics firm Unruly. HERE'S TO HEALTH After 10 years, Frito-Lay has retired its "Crash the Super Bowl" campaign for Doritos. Those ads, created by consumers, were usually filled with slapstick humor. Taking its place? A healthier approach. PepsiCo is featuring its new bottled water called LifeWTR and its sugar-free soft drink, Pepsi Zero Sugar. Bai Brands investor Justin Timberlake helps promote the company's antioxidant-infused drinks. And one of Wonderful Co.'s 15-second ads promotes the health benefits of its pistachios. Avocados from Mexico is focusing on its "healthy fats" in a humorous ad showing a secret society subliminally influenced by Jon Lovitz to chow down on guacamole. SURPRISES The biggest buzz may come from what hasn't been revealed ahead of time. Snickers' ad with Adam Driver and a "Wild West" theme will be performed live during the third quarter. Hyundai tapped "Deepwater Horizon" director Peter Berg to shoot an ad during the game itself for airing right after the game ends. Chrysler, long known for its surprise two-minute ads starring celebrities like Eminem and Clint Eastwood, won't even say whether it's advertising this year. Coca-Cola says it bought two spots, but it's keeping the topic a mystery. "Ultimately, the advertiser who gives us sweet relief without that aftertaste is going to win," DiMassimo says. "Something simple, delightful and cheerful." ___ This story has been corrected to fix the description of 84 Lumber. Get news headlines sent daily to your inbox Sign Up!

 The marijuana industry's first $1 billion 'unicorn' is a Canadian company you've probably never heard of Melia Robinson Feb. 2, 2017, 2:22 PM 50,227 facebook linkedin twitter email print Bruce Linton, founder and CEO of Canopy Growth. Andrew Szeto for Tweed Inc. In a once abandoned Hershey chocolate factory in the small town of Smiths Falls, Ontario, the largest legal marijuana producer in the world grows, trims, processes, packages, and ships weed across the Great White North. Canopy Growth is a cannabis holding company that now supplies the drug to nearly half of Canada's current medical marijuana patient base since its acquisition of rival producer Mettrum in January. Unless you're one of those 40,000 users who lights up with Canopy's bud, you've probably never heard of the company. In the fall of 2016, Canopy, which trades on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the ticker WEED, became the first company in the marijuana industry to achieve elusive "unicorn" status. The manufacturing giant blew past a $2 billion valuation on November 16, one week after eight US states passed ballot initiatives legalizing marijuana in some form. (Its valuation, along with other publicly traded marijuana companies that saw their market cap increase after the US election, has since settled to $943 million as of February 1.) The manufacturer's colossal growth stems from a belief that as more countries legalize marijuana on a federal level, companies like Canopy will be able to branch out into international markets. Canopy already exports marijuana products to Germany and Brazil. Canopy wants to become the Procter & Gamble of pot. Several brands fall under its umbrella and cater to different user preferences. There's Tweed, a medical marijuana producer with slick and youthful branding that could be mistaken for a designer jeans company. The Quebec-based Vert Medical allows Canopy to tap into the French-speaking market, while Bedrocan Canada has a distinctly clinical feel that is likely to gain favor among strictly medicinal users. Canopy Growth operates out of an abandoned factory at 1 Hershey Drive. Andrew Szeto for Tweed Inc. Every day, Bruce Linton, the founder and CEO of Canopy, passes a police station as he pulls into the parking lot of the 472,000-square-foot former chocolate factory where his company grows pot. It's a stark reminder that his success couldn't happen if he were based in the US. Since 2000, Canadians have enjoyed the ability to possess and grow small amounts of weed for medical use. In 2014, the government began licensing companies like Canopy to produce mass amounts of marijuana for patients suffering from serious diseases. The industry raked in $869 million in legal sales in 2016 and is expected to reach $22.6 billion after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau opens up the recreational market this spring. Tweed is a top Canadian producer of medical marijuana. Andrew Szeto for Tweed Inc. The legal framework around marijuana in Canada makes Canopy's growth possible, Linton tells Business Insider. "It's really about the public policy," Linton said. "That doesn't sound sexy or exciting. But if you don't have the right public policy, you don't have the right business opportunity." Linton is a Renaissance man, with over 10 years of experience working in software, telecommunications, water sanitation, and concrete manufacturing. When I asked why he made the leap into the volatile cannabis industry, I half expected him to wax poetic on the healing powers of the plant. He had a more pragmatic answer. Linton wanted to create a vertically integrated company — one that grows marijuana in addition to processing it for oils, gel capsules, and other products and packaging it for shipment — because it would give him better control over quality and bring down costs. A Canopy Growth employee stands in the halo of the marijuana grow room. Andrew Szeto for Tweed Inc. Plus, the industry has no organized competition yet, Linton said. With marijuana regulation in the US trailing Canada's more mature program, he saw an opportunity to get a head start in the increasingly global industry. He eyes the recreational market with optimism. The company's fiscal year ends in March, and Linton expects it to post $12 million in revenue, up from $2 million between 2015 and 2016. Canopy's recent acquisition of Mettrum for $430 million brings its production capacity to six licensed facilities and 665,000 square feet. Patients shouldn't expect to find stoner iconography on Canopy's website and in its facilities. The company aims to elevate the drug to higher standards. "We didn't try to pursue the lowest common denominator concept of 'Let's assume everybody's stoned and not paying attention.' We took the approach of 'Let's assume everybody's paying attention and maybe marijuana is something they're interested in,'" Linton said.

ADVERTISEMENT “My belief is if a job is worth doing, you have to do that job better than anyone who’s done it before. And I think if you can do that, then opportunities will always open up,” she says. In fact, Francisco is the first woman and the first Asian to hold that title, after working for the company for 27 years, or since she graduated from the University of the Philippines where she took up Business Administration with a specialization in Marketing. It’s a post she never even dreamt of holding, she says, especially since she initially failed her first interview with P&G. “I applied in the marketing function, and I actually failed my first interview,” she says. “But I persisted. That’s the most important part—I persisted, so I ended up becoming the first female sales manager hired in P&G Philippines after almost 50 years of operations, which was a great way to join the company.” Francisco says she was the lone female in a group of 100 in the sales team, wherein she had to learn a variety of skills, as the job then was “physically demanding.” “Between you and me, I didn’t know how to parallel park!” she says, chuckling. “And very quickly I had to be an expert with the customers I was covering. I asked a lot of my male colleagues to show me the ropes, but I think I also brought in a lot of my expertise as a female, which is understanding the consumer and the shopper even better. All in all, my early years in sales were, I think, the most fruitful.” From working in sales, Francisco moved to the company’s marketing function after four years. It was there that her career continued to grow, one that would take her to Japan where she managed the Pampers and Whisper brands, and then eventually to the United States, where she initially oversaw global operations of P&G’s baby care category, and then the company’s North America operations, before finally landing the position she has now. Just as Francisco’s professional life blossomed in P&G, so did her family. The mother of four—three boys and one girl—actually met her husband, Noel, when they were both starting out as part of the sales team in the Philippines. “He was one of the men. It was very awkward,” she says with a laugh. “When we were working together in the same function, it was awkward, but eventually we moved to different functions.” Francisco describes their marriage as a “tag team” relationship, a dynamic she believes is instrumental to her success professionally, as they see each other as partners and equals when it comes to taking care of their family. “My husband and I both have great careers in P&G. I have to admit, it’s not easy when you’re in a country without extended family, without any household help,” she says. “We had to really rely on the two of us. You just have to give and take every day.” A supportive family, combined with her persistence and a little bit of luck—it seems such is the Fama Francisco formula for professional success. It’s the persistence bit which she takes most pride in, as it was, essentially, what really got her into P&G in the first place. “Sometimes—and I think a lot of women can identify [themselves in this situation]—there’s a already a door open to you, and you hesitate. Or sometimes, you think you’re not good enough; that, oh, these are all the experiences I don’t have,” she says. “If a door is not opened to you, like when I failed my first exam in P&G, then find a way to open the door. There is a way to open it if you are persistent and you deliver the results that stand out.” play_circle_filled Duterte: De Lima ‘was corrupting everybody’ during DOJ stint February 10, 2017 play_circle_filled Duterte vows he won’t repeat mistakes of ex-president of Colombia February 10, 2017 play_circle_filled Leni urges probe into Amnesty report on ‘PNP paid killers’ February 09, 2017 play_circle_filled 'One Billion Rising' urges land justice, peace via flashmob dance February 09, 2017 TAGS: For feedback, complaints, or inquiries, contact us.

White @rjwhite1 Feb 05, 2017 • 9 min read There's a lot on the line this Sunday when the Patriots clash with the Falcons in Houston. Most important? Who will take home the win for best Super Bowl commercial. The Super Bowl is appointment viewing each year for football fans, pitting the final two teams standing against each other to determine that season's NFL champion. But for non-football fans, the Super Bowl is also a must-watch experience, if for nothing else than the ads throughout the game. More Super Bowl How to watch it TV schedule Team uniforms National anthem Halftime show How do you know that everyone will be watching? Just look at what advertisers are willing to pay to get their 30-second spot in front of a Super Bowl audience: Buying a 30-second spot will cost over $5 million on average, according to Variety. While some advertisers wait to make their big reveal during the game and others come up with a unique plan on how to make every penny spent count (more on that in a minute), others make their ads available to watch before kickoff. Below is more on what you can expect to see on Super Bowl Sunday, as well as the best and worst Super Bowl commercials of all-time. Commercials for Super Bowl LI Snickers This isn't the actual Snickers ad, but there's a very good reason for that: the company will be shooting their commercial, which features "Star Wars" star Adam Driver, live. Here's their teaser for the spot: Advertising Age reports that it's the first time a commercial will be shown live during the Super Bowl since 1981, when Schiltz ran a live taste test during Super Bowl XV. Intel The tech company enlisted Patriots quarterback Tom Brady for their commercial: Intel also managed a little bit of luck, as they debuted their commercial well before Brady and his team earned their spot in the big game. Buffalo Wild Wings B-Dubs is teaming up with Packers great Brett Favre on a series of spots leading up to their commercial during Super Bowl LI. Here's the first: You can follow the man himself on Twitter to keep up with the campaign. Squarespace The website builder/domain hosting company follows John Malkovich's quest to sign up for a URL: Squarespace's Super Bowl spots have previously featured Jeff Bridges, Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele. Lexus The car manufacturer is going with a dance-themed ad to promote the 2018 LC 500 performance coupe. Here's an extended version of the spot: If the performer looks familiar, it's because Lil' Buck is also in the Apple AirPods commercial that debuted this January. Skittles The candy company may wind up with the biggest buzz of all Super Bowl commercials by the time the game is over. Here's a look: It's already appeared on YouTube's list of trending videos and had amassed more than 500,000 by Wednesday afternoon after going live the previous day. GoDaddy After years of being known for their risque ads, the Internet service provider has gone lighter in recent years. They appear to be continuing in that vein with this year's spot. Here are several teasers for their Super Bowl ad: The actual Super Bowl ad will turn "The Internet" into a person. Don't anticipate a famous celebrity playing the role, per Advertising Age. TurboTax The tax preparation company dropped their first teaser during Sunday's AFC Championship Game, featuring none other than Humpty Dumpty: Two additional teasers are scheduled leading up to the company's 45-second Super Bowl spot, per Advertising Age. Wix.com The website builder's ad answers a very important question: What happens when Wonder Woman meets The Transporter? The ad above debuted on YouTube Live and Facebook Live amassed more than 2 million views on YouTube in the eight days since its release. Kia The auto company will be advertising its 2017 Kia Niro during the game, but they dropped a 15-second teaser this week: Melissa McCarthy, star of the long-running CBS sitcom "Mike & Molly," features in the spot. Mr. Clean The official cleaner of Super Bowl LI, Mr. Clean released their official Super Bowl commercial on YouTube: It's Procter & Gamble's first Super Bowl ad ever for the iconic character, USA Today reports. Avocados from Mexico The avocado awareness organization features Jon Lovitz in their hypnotic teaser for this year's offering: The organization earned plenty of buzz for its first Super Bowl ad in 2015 featuring the "First Draft Ever." Mercedes-Benz The car company debuted a 1-minute version of their Coen Brothers-directed Super Bowl ad on YouTube on Friday: Peter Fonda stars in the ad for the Mercedes-AMG GT Roadster. Buick Hey look, it's Cam Newton playing Pee Wee football! Miranda Kerr also shows up to coach the NFL star in the spot for the auto company. Wonderful Pistachios The pistachio company will run two 15-second ads during the Super Bowl, including a new spot called "Treadmill": The ad will run during the first quarter, per Advertising Age. Wendy's The fast-food restaurant drew attention recently for roasting critics on social media, and the spat that started it all gets a callback for their Super Bowl spot: Lesson: Be sure you know your facts before you engage in Twitter trollery. Nintendo The video game company is debuting its first ever Super Bowl commercial to promote their new gaming system: Longtime fans of the company should love all the details crammed into the spot. Sprint Going morbid hasn't worked out well for companies (which we'll get into in our Worst Ad Ever section), but that didn't stop Sprint from scheduling this spot for the Super Bowl: The cell carrier plans to release an alternate version after the game, per Advertising Age. Ford Rather than promote a specific vehicle, the auto company will try and intrigue with its vision of the future: In related news, Ford announced its "FordHub NYC" experience. LIFEWTR PepsiCo's new bottled water breaks out the star power for "Inspiration Drops": Two-time Oscar winner Robert Stromberg directs the spot with music from John Legend. King's Hawaiian This will be the first-even Super Bowl ad for the Hawaiian food company: Look for it in the fourth quarter. Audi The auto maker jumps into the political fray with their spot about equal pay: "Daughter" is slated to air during the third quarter. FIJI Water The Wonderful Company is reportedly using an existing ad for the water brand's first-ever Super Bowl spot: It'll be the second spot of the day for the company, known for its pistachios. Budweiser In the commercial sure to stir up the most debate at your Super Bowl party, the beer giant is tapping into the recent immigration debate with "Born the Hard Way": Filmed in New Orleans, the spot is sure to spur a visceral reaction for many. Febreze The odor-buster attempts to capture the thing everyone at your Super Bowl party is thinking with "Halftime Bathroom Break": Turning away from the TV at halftime, of course, means missing a chance to see Lady Gaga's performance. KFC One Colonel Sanders isn't enough for the fast-food company in this Super Bowl spot: That's Rob Riggle, who has previously starred in KFC's ads, and Billy Zane. T-Mobile The cell company calls upon Rob Gronkowski, Terrell Owens and a bespectacled Justin Bieber for this year's Super Bowl spot: Send T-Mobile your touchdown dances and they could be retweeted by Bieber himself, which is something. Tiffany & Co. The jewelry company is tapping Super Bowl LI halftime performer Lady Gaga for their spot. Here's a preview: You can read more about Gaga's plans for halftime here. NFL The league garnered a lot of buzz for last year's "The Super Bowl Babies Choir" spot, and they're going back to the well with "Super Bowl Baby Legends": The ad will run just before the start of the second half. Bud Light Miss Spuds MacKenzie? Then you're in luck, as the beer giant is going back to the well with "Ghost Spuds": The ad had more than 1.4 million views in its first two days on YouTube. Busch This beer company has a new spokesman who they're calling "Busch Guy": Note the new can for the spot as well. Tide Tide has released several teasers for their Super Bowl commercial featuring Rob Gronkowski and "Transparent" actor Jeffrey Tambor. Gronk is proving to be a popular pitch man for Super Bowl Sunday. Honda Do you have any embarrassing high school photos tucked away? So do celebrities! Persil The detergent maker will help Bill Nye the Science Guy clean up in their Super Bowl spot. Here's the teaser: That's "Law and Order: Special Victims Unit" and "Blue Bloods" star Peter Hermann in the teaser. Michelob Ultra The low-cal brand of beer stays true to their market with "Our Bar": The cast of "Cheers," this ain't. Bai The beverage company has released a teaser for its Super Bowl Spot starring Justin Timberlake: Bai offers what they call "antioxidant infusion drinks." Mobile Strike Arnold Schwarzenegger is back to pitch the mobile game at the Super Bowl: If you're taking odds on which commercial President Donald Trump will tweet about during the game, this is as good a bet as any. Michelin The tire company is jumping into the Super Bowl mix for the first time this year with "I Need You": The ad is a departure from Michelin's previous marketing strategy, as Michelin Man appears in a real-world scenario rather than his typical animated world. Yellow Tail The Australian winery is breaking all kinds of ground with the first Super Bowl wine ad in a long time: Unable to purchase a nationwide spot due to Anheuser-Busch InBev's exclusive rights agreement, Yellow Tail has gobbled up local spots to the point where the ad will reach 85 percent of Super Bowl viewers, per I4U. Evony: The King's Return It's hard to believe the ad below is for a mobile game and not some summer blockbuster: Aaron Eckhart plays George Washington, Jeffrey Dean Morgan is King Arthur and Fan Bingbing features as Empress Wu Zetian. 84 Lumber The construction supply company has been part of some controversy after Fox rejected their initial ad, which concluded with a Latin American mother and daughter confronting a border wall. Here's Part I, titled "The Journey Begins": Keep an eye out for their reworked commercial during the game, and head online at halftime to check out their original planned ad. Top five Super Bowl ads ever 5. Volkswagen (2011) Of all the more recent ad spots, this one sticks out: Can you get any more adorable than a mini-Darth Vader trying to use The Force? 4. Budweiser (1989) The first Bud Bowl was held during Super Bowl XXIII: The spot would have seven sequels throughout the '90s in arguably the most memorable long-running ad campaign in Super Bowl history. 3. Apple (1984) While not as sports-centric as most of the top ads on this list, there's no denying the debut of the Apple Macintosh its spot: The Super Bowl spot was the only time Apple ran this ad, which is arguably among the top commercials of all time. 2. McDonald's (1993) The fast-food company landed a pair of iconic NBA stars to battle over their burgers and fries: I'd watch these two go at it in a head-to-head shooting contest today. Get on it, McDonald's. 1. Coca-Cola (1980) Could it be anything else? Often imitated but never duplicated, Mean Joe Greene's Coke commercial launched 37 years of must-see Super Bowl commercial viewing. Worst Super Bowl ad ever Fortune.com has a great list of terrible Super Bowl ads worth checking out. While many didn't work due to insensitive takes on race, death and other topics and deserve consideration, one was proud to declare itself the worst commercial ever. Despite having no reason to offend, Lifeminders.com is just that: Unsurprisingly, the website didn't stick around for the long haul.

"All true histories contain instruction; though, in some, the treasure may be hard to find, and when found, so trivial in quantity that the dry, shrivelled kernel scarcely compensates for the trouble of cracking the nut." ― Anne Brontë in "Agnes Grey" "Today in Soap Opera History" is a collection of the most memorable, interesting and influential events in the history of scripted, serialized programs. From birthdays and anniversaries to scandals and controversies, every day this column celebrates the soap opera in American culture. On this date in... 1966: The Guiding Light's Mike Bauer (Gary Pillar) debuted on Another World in a crossover involving two Procter & Gamble shows and two different networks that would last a year. His first scene was with Mitchell Dru, the first soap opera crossover character, having previously appeared on The Brighter Day and As the World Turns. Elissa Leeds would join Another World as Mike's daughter, Hope Bauer, on March 25. 1972: On The Doctors, as she drifted off to sleep Dr. Maggie Powers (Lydia Bruce) had another vision of Frank, who told her that she could not get rid of him because he was the only person who would tell her the truth. He asks if she was really going to burden her nice husband with a crazy wife for the rest of his life. 1975: On Another World Rachel (Victoria Wyndham) fretted to Ada (Constance Ford) she didn't have enough friends to be bridesmaids. Ada worried where Jamie (Robert Doran) would be living while they waited for the house to be built, so Gil (Dolph Sweet) suggested buying and renovating an old mansion. 1976: On Ryan's Hope, Jack (Michael Levin) was jealous of Mary's (Kate Mulgrew) relationship with Sam. Thanks to Jennifer for sending in the item above. 1980: The Young and the Restless expanded to an hour. Until the previous Friday, 30 minute versions of Y&R and Search for Tomorrow had aired at 12 p.m and 12:30 p.m. ET, respectively (and had been since Y&R's premiere in 1973). The noon half hour was returned to the affiliates and the one hour Y&R moved to 1 p.m. after SFT. As the World Turns moved to 2 p.m. followed by Guiding Light at 3 p.m. One Day at a Time repeats shifted into the 4 p.m. timeslot previously occupied by canceled long-running soap opera Love of Live. Y&R co-creator William J. Bell resisted the hour format for many years. "I thought the half-hour was such a perfect form," he said in a fascinating 1997 interview. "When I was doing Days of our Lives and they said we were going to go an hour, everyone was excited. I was the one that stopped it. I said: You go an hour, you're going without me. Then we put The Young and the Restless on the air, but after about eight years, CBS wanted to go an hour—I got a lot of pressure, and I resisted. The stories I could tell you about that." "Finally I said, 'Look, if you want to announce it, you do that. But just know that I may not be ready and I may not go along with this when the time comes.' The next day, Lee [Phillip Bell] and I got home from Lake Geneva and there was a case of ‘64 Dom Perignon and a massive floral arrangement. Finally, in November, I said, 'Look, guys, I'm just not going to do it.' At that point they said all the affiliates were excited that their number one show was going to go an hour. They said, 'Bill, we are committed to the affiliates. The ship is going to sail in eight weeks, with or without you.' I'll never forget that line. When I told Kay [Alden], she cried for two days. We were the first place show when we went an hour. You want to know what happened? It took us four years to regain that position. Four years. " 1980: On Guiding Light, Roger (Michael Zaslow) kidnapped Rita (Lenore Kasdorf)from the Hall of Mirrors with Donna Summer's "Enough is Enough" playing in the background. 1980: On The Edge of Night, Derek (Dennis Parker) worked to get a warrant to arrest Draper for Margo's murder. 1981: On Another World, Jamie Frame (Richard Bekins) asked Cecile Depoulignac (Susan Keith) on a date. 2004: On All My Children, Greenlee (Rebecca Budig) ripped Kendall's (Alicia Minshew) dress in open court where she stood trial for killing Michael Cambias. Thanks to Enrique for sending in the item above. 2005: On The Young and the Restless, Jack (Peter Bergman) refused to leave Jabot. After throwing his desk chair through the Jabot window, Jack said to Victor, "You like this chair? You want this chair? Have a seat, on me!" 2008: Actress Augusta Dabney died at age 82. Her soap roles include Isabelle Alden on Loving, Betty Kahlman in A World Apart, Ann Holmes on Another World, Laura Baxter in Another World, Tracy Malone on Young Doctor Malone and Barbara Norris on The Guiding Light. 2013: On General Hospital, Rafe Kovich, Jr. (Jimmy Deshler) told Anna Devane (Finola Hughes) about the night he found his murdered mother, Alison Barrington (Erin Hershey Presley).

After an overwhelmingly positive reception to season 1 of the HBO series, we had a feeling we’d be seeing a lot more of Yvonne, but we had no idea how soon. On February 11, she’s set to star in her own commercial on the evolution of beauty in Black Hollywood. The ad spot is the result of a collaboration between P&G’s My Black is Beautiful Initiative and the Image Awards to showcase black beauty in its various forms. In the commercial, the Nigerian-American actress, who’s also an Image Award nominee, will share her perspective on the evolution of Black beauty in Hollywood while embodying that very evolution herself with her chocolate skin, textured ‘fro, full lips, and contagious smile. Check out behind-the-scenes photos from the shoot and be sure to tune in to the NAACP Image Awards Saturday, February 11 on TV One. Red carpet starts at 7:30. [madamenoire] No Work, No School, No Spending: National Strike Against Trump Slated For February 17 Protests continue to pop up at various locations around the country in response to President Donald Trump’s Muslim travel ban, but now citizens around the United States are attempting to organize a national strike in which no one would go to work, school, or spend money on February 17 in a unified stance against our Commander-in-Chief. According to Cosmo, activists got the idea from Francine Prose, an American Writer who, in a column for The Guardian Monday, said: “Forget protest. Trump’s actions warrant a general national strike.” “So what can we do to protest our current government’s callousness about our environment and our health, its rampant greed, its disrespect for life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness?,” she wrote. “I believe that what we need is a nonviolent national general strike of the kind that has been more common in Europe than here. Let’s designate a day on which no one (that is, anyone who can do so without being fired) goes to work, a day when no one shops or spends money, a day on which we truly make our economic and political power felt, a day when we make it clear: how many of us there are, how strong and committed we are, how much we can accomplish.” [madamenoire] Did Shaq Consider Blessing Charles Barkley With A Fade On TV? The attention to the drama between LeBron James and Charles Barkley is slowly but surely petering out, but it’s making for some interesting TV. When discussing the matter on TNT Inside The NBA, Shaq told Chuck he would have stepped to him with the hands if he told him, like he told King James, he didn’t want to “compete.” Shaq made the point that it was the personal nature of Barkley’s critique that set LeBron James off. “When you said that man doesn’t want to compete, that’s what ticked him off. And I woulda did the same thing,” Shaq told Barkley. “I woulda came right back at your rack. I woulda came up here and punched you in your face. That’s what I woulda did.” To this, Chuck said, “Well first of all you’re not a good fighter…” There was a slight chuckle heard, then crickets. Bruh…look at Shaq’s face. Specifically, his eyes. It’s like he was measuring out how long it would take him to get to the other side of the table and mete out swift justice.

(Bud Light) Melissa McCarthy humorously takes on political causes in Kia's Super Bowl ad. (Kia Motors America) By MAE ANDERSON, Associated Press Published: February 4, 2017, 5:00 AM A   A NEW YORK — Super Bowl advertisers are treading carefully this year to avoid alienating customers as a divisive political climate takes some of the buzz away from what is usually the biggest spectacle on TV. Ad critic Barbara Lippert says that while “people need an escape,” like the Super Bowl, this year’s matchup on the field feels “so much less important than what’s going on politically.” To get the attention back, some advertisers are turning to nostalgia, celebrities and marketing stunts. P&G is sexing up Mr. Clean, Honda is featuring nine celebrities and Snickers is running a live ad. Others are touching on social issues, without being too blunt about it. Budweiser won the pre-game buzz with a sweeping cinematic ad showcasing founder Adolphus Busch’s 1857 immigration from Germany to St. Louis. Although it has been in the works since May , the ad felt topical, as it was released online just days after President Donald Trump’s travel ban against people from seven Muslim-majority countries. The ad got more than 8 million views on YouTube in just four days. Although many brands released ads online ahead of time, there will still be surprises during Fox’s Super Bowl broadcast Sunday. At $5 million for a 30-second spot, and an expected U.S. audience of more than 110 million, the pressure is on. Tiptoeing around politics Audi’s spot addresses gender equality as a man muses about his daughter receiving equal pay as men one day. Building supplies retailer 84 Lumber had to revise its original ad because a scene featuring a border wall was deemed too controversial by Fox. The new ad shows a Mexican woman and her daughter making a trip by foot across Mexico. The ad’s ending will be revealed at halftime at http://journey84.com; the website suggests excised footage will be shown. And Kia attempts a humorous approach. In an ad for the Niro car, Melissa McCarthy takes on political causes like saving whales, ice caps and trees, each time to disastrous effect. The message: “It’s hard to be an eco-warrior, but it’s easy to drive like one” with a fuel-efficient Niro. Though advertisers are being extra careful, taking on any sort of political topic might backfire, says Mark DiMassimo, CEO of ad agency DiMassimo Goldstein. Against the backdrop of an “emboldened, enraged or traumatized audience,” he says, themes that might have been innocuous in the past “seem more strident and jarring this year.” Lots of celebrities In turbulent times, brands can count on celebrities to ensure goodwill among consumers. And why use one celebrity when you can have many? In Honda’s ad , the high-school yearbook photos of Amy Adams, Steve Carell, Viola Davis, Missy Elliott, Tina Fey, Magic Johnson, Jimmy Kimmel, Stan Lee and Robert Redford come to life with special effects. The animations encourage people to follow their dreams in a nod to Honda’s longtime slogan, “The Power of Dreams.” Website hosting company Squarespace shows an intense John Malkovich berating the owner of johnmalkovich.com domain name. Justin Bieber shows off dance moves to tout T-Mobile cellphone offerings. For the baby boomer crowd, Mercedes-Benz shows a biker gang being amazed by Peter Fonda’s AMG GT roadster to the tune of Steppenwolf’s “Born to be Wild.” “The proliferation of athletes and more personalities is a reflection of not taking too much risk,” says Kelly O’Keefe from Virginia Commonwealth University’s advertising graduate program. “When in doubt get a personality.” Blast from the past Anheuser-Busch joins Mercedes-Benz in trying to reach consumers with nostalgia. The brewer’s ad shows a mountain man opening a can of Busch beer to the sound of “Buschhhhh.” It’s a nod to the brand’s ad campaign, introduced in 1978, which lasted for decades. Meanwhile, Bud Light is bringing back the ghost of its 1980s spokesdog Spuds Mackenzie — literally. In its ad, the dog appears as a ghost dangling in the air, urging a Bud Light drinker to go out and join his friends, like the ghosts in the holiday classic “A Christmas Carol.” And P&G sexes up its Mr. Clean mascot, introduced as an animated character in 1958. In the new ad , he distracts a woman as he cleans her kitchen. “Emotions are the secret sauce of getting people to do things, and nostalgia is a great reason for people to pay attention,” says Devra Prywes of video analytics firm Unruly. Here’s to health After 10 years, Frito-Lay has retired its “Crash the Super Bowl” campaign for Doritos. Those ads, created by consumers, were usually filled with slapstick humor. Taking its place? A healthier approach. PepsiCo is featuring its new bottled water called LifeWTR and its sugar-free soft drink, Pepsi Zero Sugar. Bai Brands investor Justin Timberlake helps promote the company’s antioxidant-infused drinks. And one of Wonderful Co.’s 15-second ads promotes the health benefits of its pistachios. Avocados from Mexico is focusing on its “healthy fats” in a humorous ad showing a secret society subliminally influenced by Jon Lovitz to chow down on guacamole. Surprises The biggest buzz may come from what hasn’t been revealed ahead of time. Snickers’ ad with Adam Driver and a “Wild West” theme will be performed live during the third quarter. Hyundai tapped “Deepwater Horizon” director Peter Berg to shoot an ad during the game itself for airing right after the game ends. Chrysler, long known for its surprise two-minute ads starring celebrities like Eminem and Clint Eastwood, won’t even say whether it’s advertising this year. Coca-Cola says it bought two spots, but it’s keeping the topic a mystery. “Ultimately, the advertiser who gives us sweet relief without that aftertaste is going to win,” DiMassimo says. “Something simple, delightful and cheerful.” Please take a second to review our community guidelinesCommunity guidelines Blogs Staff Blogs Home All Politics is Local Blazer Banter Brews in Clark Cannabis Chronicles Clark County Faces Digital Desk Family Room Ghost Stories High School Sports HealthBeat History Political Beat Tailgate Talk Community It's the Fair!

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Monday, 6 February 2017 | MYT 6:44 AM Wall St. Week Ahead: US$'s sudden weakness could help US profit picture Coupled with comments suggesting that the Trump administration favors a weaker currency, that could shift the picture for the current quarter NEW YORK: Stock investors could have at least one less worry in the next earnings period: the suddenly limp U.S. dollar. The greenback, whose strong rally after the Nov. 8 U.S. election hit profits at many U.S. multinationals in the fourth quarter, has had a sharp reversal since the start of the year. Coupled with comments suggesting that the Trump administration favors a weaker currency, that could shift the picture for the current quarter. Fourth-quarter results, even with the dollar's drag, are mostly beating Wall Street's expectations and helping provide a buffer to some of the uncertainties facing investors, including the new U.S. president's policies. The S&P 500 <.SPX> ended with a slight gain for the week. With earnings in from more than half the S&P 500 companies, year-over-year profit growth for the fourth quarter is now estimated at 8.0 percent, up from 6.1 percent forecast at the start of January, and on track to be the strongest since the third quarter of 2014, according to Thomson Reuters data. Analysts expect first-quarter earnings to rise 11.5 percent. That "sets the stage for a stronger Q1, particularly when you look at the jobs numbers coming out and when you look at the business confidence surveys and consumer confidence surveys. There's a lot of improving sentiment," said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer for Commonwealth Financial in Waltham, Massachusetts. U.S. nonfarm payrolls had the largest increase in four months in January. "Even as the companies are talking their expectations down, consumers and businesses are likely to act on that better sentiment." The dollar index <.DXY> on Jan. 31 posted its worst start to a year in three decades, putting in a decline of 2.6 percent for January after gaining 7.1 percent in the last quarter of 2016. Comments this week by President Donald Trump and a top economics adviser suggested to some that the administration is prepared to jettison two decades of "strong dollar" policies advocated by predecessors. A strong dollar is a worry for equity investors because it makes U.S. multinationals' foreign currency earnings worth less in dollars. Nearly half of S&P 500 sales come from overseas, according to S&P-Dow Jones Indices. Executives from a slew of U.S. companies cited the strong dollar as a negative in their fourth-quarter reports and also concern about its effect on 2017 results. Among them, Apple <AAPL.O> gave a cautious outlook for the current quarter that it mainly attributed to the strong dollar, despite its upbeat fourth-quarter results. "For a company like ours where we do about two-thirds of our business outside the United States, the strong dollar presents a headwind of more than 2 percent growth," Apple Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri told Reuters. Other companies citing currency hurdles for the last quarter or for 2017 included Procter & Gamble <PG.N>, Mead Johnson Nutrition <MJN.N>, 3M Co <MMM.N> and PPG Industries <PPG.N>. Procter & Gamble said it expects combined headwinds of foreign exchange and minor brand divestitures to cut sales growth by two to three percentage points for fiscal 2017. Some strategists say the dollar is still likely to be stronger rather than weaker this year, especially given expectations for interest rate hikes for this year, but that earnings should still benefit from an improving economy. "You should get more than enough growth from the economy if you're a corporation to more than offset the rise in the dollar," said Sameer Samana, global quantitative strategist for Wells Fargo Investment Institute, which expects the dollar index to rise 7 percent by year end.- Reuetrs Tags / Keywords: Stocks , Earnings , Banking , Commodities , Economy , Foreign News , Corporate News , Banking , Economy , Forex , Investing , Markets You May Be Interested Mah Sing on transformation mode BBCC developer signs deal for Zepp concert hall Leong has come a full circle Spritzer starts UK exports P&G Malaysia backs MRC viewability standards Experiencing painful menses?

Soumonty Kanungo Mohan Goenka, executive director, Emami Ltd. Photo: Indranil Bhoumik/Mint Kolkata: Consumer goods maker Emami Ltd has stopped investing in its sanitary napkin business and is looking to sell its She Comfort brand after acquiring it for an undisclosed sum in June 2014. Executive director Mohan Goenka said in a recent analysts’ meet that Emami had written off all its investments in the business and was looking for a buyer for She Comfort. However, he later added: “We will wait for a while, as internally we are in two minds.” Though Emami never gave numbers, analysts estimate the brand to have cost around Rs25 crore when Emami acquired it from Mumbai-based Royal Hygiene Care Pvt. Ltd. Its sales at that time were estimated at Rs22-23 crore a year. At the beginning of the current financial year, Emami said sanitary napkin categories were expected to grow “exponentially” because of increasing awareness and affordability. The market for sanitary napkins remains small at Rs2,500-2,800 crore and largely concentrated in cities. Only 9% of India’s women use sanitary napkins, according to Emami’s own estimates. The rest use cheaper substitutes. But Emami failed to expand the market. She Comfort is not even sold nationally—sells only in a “few pockets” of south India, according to an analyst who asked not to be identified. In a call with analysts last year, Goenka said Emami was test-marketing She Comfort in Andhra Pradesh, and that his company was still trying to understand the nuances of this business. Emami didn’t ever get to the stage of investing big sums into the business, said the analyst cited above. To be sure, the sanitary napkin market in India is small and dominated by international consumer goods behemoths such as Procter and Gamble Hygiene and Health Care Ltd, Hindustan Unilever Ltd and Johnson and Johnson Pvt. Ltd. There is an opportunity to expand sales in the rural market, but changing mind-sets is difficult, said the analyst cited above, adding that even the leaders in the business are struggling to make inroads into the rural market. And within the existing consumer base, it is “very difficult” to get people to switch to new brands. Naveen Trivedi, an analyst at HDFC Securities Ltd who specialises in consumer goods, said She Comfort isn’t too critical within Emami’s large portfolio of businesses, and it is good that the company is looking to move on. Strategies change with time, and it helps to take “tough calls” at the right time, he said, clarifying that he doesn’t track Emami closely.

Africa América Latina عربي Argentina Brasil Canada 中国 Deutschland España France India Italia 日本 México РОССИЯ United Kingdom United States Market News | Sun Feb 5, 2017 | 1:00pm EST RPT-Wall St Week Ahead-Dollar's sudden weakness could help U.S. profit picture (Repeats Friday story with no changes) By Caroline Valetkevitch and Sinead Carew NEW YORK Feb 3 Stock investors could have at least one less worry in the next earnings period: the suddenly limp U.S. dollar. The greenback, whose strong rally after the Nov. 8 U.S. election hit profits at many U.S. multinationals in the fourth quarter, has had a sharp reversal since the start of the year. Coupled with comments suggesting that the Trump administration favors a weaker currency, that could shift the picture for the current quarter. Fourth-quarter results, even with the dollar's drag, are mostly beating Wall Street's expectations and helping provide a buffer to some of the uncertainties facing investors, including the new U.S. president's policies. The S&P 500 ended with a slight gain for the week. With earnings in from more than half the S&P 500 companies, year-over-year profit growth for the fourth quarter is now estimated at 8.0 percent, up from 6.1 percent forecast at the start of January, and on track to be the strongest since the third quarter of 2014, according to Thomson Reuters data. Analysts expect first-quarter earnings to rise 11.5 percent. That "sets the stage for a stronger Q1, particularly when you look at the jobs numbers coming out and when you look at the business confidence surveys and consumer confidence surveys. There's a lot of improving sentiment," said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer for Commonwealth Financial in Waltham, Massachusetts. U.S. nonfarm payrolls had the largest increase in four months in January. "Even as the companies are talking their expectations down, consumers and businesses are likely to act on that better sentiment." The dollar index on Jan. 31 posted its worst start to a year in three decades, putting in a decline of 2.6 percent for January after gaining 7.1 percent in the last quarter of 2016. Comments this week by President Donald Trump and a top economics adviser suggested to some that the administration is prepared to jettison two decades of "strong dollar" policies advocated by predecessors. A strong dollar is a worry for equity investors because it makes U.S. multinationals' foreign currency earnings worth less in dollars. Nearly half of S&P 500 sales come from overseas, according to S&P-Dow Jones Indices. Executives from a slew of U.S. companies cited the strong dollar as a negative in their fourth-quarter reports and also concern about its effect on 2017 results. Among them, Apple gave a cautious outlook for the current quarter that it mainly attributed to the strong dollar, despite its upbeat fourth-quarter results. "For a company like ours where we do about two-thirds of our business outside the United States, the strong dollar presents a headwind of more than 2 percent growth," Apple Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri told Reuters. Other companies citing currency hurdles for the last quarter or for 2017 included Procter & Gamble, Mead Johnson Nutrition, 3M Co and PPG Industries. Procter & Gamble said it expects combined headwinds of foreign exchange and minor brand divestitures to cut sales growth by two to three percentage points for fiscal 2017. Some strategists say the dollar is still likely to be stronger rather than weaker this year, especially given expectations for interest rate hikes for this year, but that earnings should still benefit from an improving economy. "You should get more than enough growth from the economy if you're a corporation to more than offset the rise in the dollar," said Sameer Samana, global quantitative strategist for Wells Fargo Investment Institute, which expects the dollar index to rise 7 percent by year end.

(WLS) AP Sunday, February 05, 2017 08:21PM NEW YORK -- The Super Bowl isn't just played on the field. Just as intense is a battle off the field to win viewers' attentions. Advertisers are paying $5 million for just 30 seconds to reach the more than 110 million people in the U.S. expected to tune in. Which ads will be the most talked about? Which ads will be the most remembered years from now, long after the Atlanta Falcons and the New England Patriots square off? Here are 11 Super Bowl ads to watch during Sunday's broadcast on Fox. ___ 84 Lumber, "The Journey Begins " First-time Super Bowl advertiser 84 Lumber seems to wade into political territory with a 90-second spot that shows a Mexican woman and her daughter traveling across Mexico on foot. The daughter collects pieces of fabric along the way. The ad appears in the first half - without the conclusion. The ending will be shown online at halftime at http://journey84.com. ___ NFL, "Super Bowl Baby Legends" The NFL's 30-second ad features baby versions of Super Bowl legends such a sunglasses-wearing, mustachioed Baby Ditka and another decked out in a fur coat as "Broadway" Joe Namath. Also included are a baby Belichik in trademark hoodie and a Von Miller baby with cowboy hat. ___ Bud Light, "Ghost Spuds " Bud Light is bringing back its iconic 1980s mascot, Spuds Mackenzie, sort of. The dog appears as an unsettling T-shirted ghost. The dog eggs on a Bud Light drinker to go out and join his friends rather than sit at home alone. It's the 30th anniversary of the bull terrier's first appearance in a Bud Light ad. The 90-second ad is running during the fourth quarter. ___ Budweiser, "Born the Hard Way " Anheuser-Busch's cinematic 60-second spot chronicles co-founder Adolphus Busch's journey from Germany to St. Louis in 1857. He jumps off a burning steamboat and catches a glimpse of Budweiser's iconic Clydesdales mascots before meeting fellow immigrant Eberhard Anheuser. The second-quarter ad became topical since it was released online Tuesday, just days after President Donald Trump signed an executive order to temporarily ban refugees and nearly all citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries. Anheuser-Busch, which started working on the ad in May, says the ad isn't making a political statement. ___ Honda, "Yearbooks" To promote Honda's CR-V vehicle, a 60-second second-quarter ad features high-school yearbook photos for nine celebrities - Amy Adams, Steve Carell, Viola Davis, Missy Elliott, Tina Fey, Earvin "Magic" Johnson, Jimmy Kimmel, Stan Lee and Robert Redford. The photos come to life and encourage people to follow their dreams, a nod to Honda's 15-year slogan "The Power of Dreams." The photos are actual yearbook photos, but the yearbook page surrounding them were created by the agency RPA, Honda says. Some lines were ad-libbed during filming rather than scripted. For example, Carell came up with the name "Darryl" next to him. ___ Hyundai, "Operation Better" Hyundai enlisted director Peter Berg ("Deepwater Horizon") to shoot and edit a 90-second ad during the game itself. It will air directly after the game. Teasers hint of footage from both at the Super Bowl and elsewhere. ___ Mercedes-Benz, "Easy Driver" It's been a long time since 1969's "Easy Rider" brought the counterculture to the big screen. To target baby boomers, Mercedes-Benz enlisted the Coen brothers to direct an update to the tune of Steppenwolf's "Born to be Wild." Bikers at a bar are furious that their bikes have been blocked by a car - until they realize it's Peter Fonda driving a Mercedes-Benz AMG Roadster. The 30-second ad is scheduled for the fourth quarter. ___ Kia, "Hero's Journey" Melissa McCarthy humorously takes on political causes like saving whales, ice caps and trees, each time to disastrous effect. Kia's 60-second third-quarter ad promotes the fuel efficiency of its 2017 Niro car. ___ Mr. Clean, "Cleaner of Your Dreams" P&G takes an unusual approach to promoting the kitchen cleaner, as the animated character Mr. Clean, introduced in 1958, gets some sex appeal. In the 30-second third-quarter ad, a woman in her kitchen gets distracted watching an animated Mr. Clean in tight white pants dance around her kitchen as he cleans. ___ Snicker's live ad Mars' Snickers brand is attempting a 30-second live ad during the first break in the third quarter. The ad features Adam Driver and a wild-west theme. Leading to the game, Snickers has a live stream at snickerslive.com with views and other content from the ad's set. Snickers says it's doing plenty of rehearsals and turning to multiple satellite feeds to make sure the ad goes off without a hitch. ___ Squarespace, "Calling John Malkovich" Squarespace's 30-second ad slated for the first half shows a prickly John Malkovich calling the owner of JohnMalkovich.com to yell at him because he wants the domain.

The dog eggs on a Bud Light drinker to go out and join his friends rather than sit at home alone. It’s the 30th anniversary of the bull terrier’s first appearance in a Bud Light ad. The 90-second ad is running during the fourth quarter. ___ Budweiser, “Born the Hard Way “ Anheuser-Busch’s cinematic 60-second spot chronicles co-founder Adolphus Busch’s journey from Germany to St. Louis in 1857. He jumps off a burning steamboat and catches a glimpse of Budweiser’s iconic Clydesdales mascots before meeting fellow immigrant Eberhard Anheuser. The second-quarter ad became topical since it was released online Tuesday, just days after President Donald Trump signed an executive order to temporarily ban refugees and nearly all citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries. Anheuser-Busch, which started working on the ad in May, says the ad isn’t making a political statement. ___ Honda, “Yearbooks “ To promote Honda’s CR-V vehicle, a 60-second second-quarter ad features high-school yearbook photos for nine celebrities — Amy Adams, Steve Carell, Viola Davis, Missy Elliott, Tina Fey, Earvin “Magic” Johnson, Jimmy Kimmel, Stan Lee and Robert Redford. The photos come to life and encourage people to follow their dreams, a nod to Honda’s 15-year slogan “The Power of Dreams.” Advertisement The photos are actual yearbook photos, but the yearbook page surrounding them were created by the agency RPA, Honda says. Some lines were ad-libbed during filming rather than scripted. For example, Carell came up with the name “Darryl” next to him. ___ Hyundai, “Operation Better” Hyundai enlisted director Peter Berg (“Deepwater Horizon”) to shoot and edit a 90-second ad during the game itself. It will air directly after the game. Teasers hint of footage from both at the Super Bowl and elsewhere. ___ Mercedes-Benz, “Easy Driver “ It’s been a long time since 1969’s “Easy Rider” brought the counterculture to the big screen. To target baby boomers, Mercedes-Benz enlisted the Coen brothers to direct an update to the tune of Steppenwolf’s “Born to be Wild.” Bikers at a bar are furious that their bikes have been blocked by a car — until they realize it’s Peter Fonda driving a Mercedes-Benz AMG Roadster. The 30-second ad is scheduled for the fourth quarter. ___ Kia, “Hero’s Journey “ Melissa McCarthy humorously takes on political causes like saving whales, ice caps and trees, each time to disastrous effect. Kia’s 60-second third-quarter ad promotes the fuel efficiency of its 2017 Niro car. ___ Mr. Clean, “Cleaner of Your Dreams “ P&G takes an unusual approach to promoting the kitchen cleaner, as the animated character Mr. Clean, introduced in 1958, gets some sex appeal. In the 30-second third-quarter ad, a woman in her kitchen gets distracted watching an animated Mr. Clean in tight white pants dance around her kitchen as he cleans. Advertisement ___ Snicker’s live ad Mars’ Snickers brand is attempting a 30-second live ad during the first break in the third quarter. The ad features Adam Driver and a wild-west theme. Leading to the game, Snickers has a live stream at snickerslive.com with views and other content from the ad’s set. Snickers says it’s doing plenty of rehearsals and turning to multiple satellite feeds to make sure the ad goes off without a hitch. ___ Squarespace, “Calling John Malkovich “ Squarespace’s 30-second ad slated for the first half shows a prickly John Malkovich calling the owner of JohnMalkovich.com to yell at him because he wants the domain.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 10:50 AM, February 5, 2017 Updated: 6:00 PM, February 5, 2017 NEW YORK - Stock investors could have at least one less worry in the next earnings period: the suddenly limp U.S. dollar. The greenback, whose strong rally after the Nov. 8 U.S. election hit profits at many U.S. multinationals in the fourth quarter, has had a sharp reversal since the start of the year. Coupled with comments suggesting that the Trump administration favors a weaker currency, that could shift the picture for the current quarter. Fourth-quarter results, even with the dollar's drag, are mostly beating Wall Street's expectations and helping provide a buffer to some of the uncertainties facing investors, including the new U.S. president's policies. The S&P 500 <.SPX> ended with a slight gain for the week. With earnings in from more than half the S&P 500 companies, year-over-year profit growth for the fourth quarter is now estimated at 8.0 percent, up from 6.1 percent forecast at the start of January, and on track to be the strongest since the third quarter of 2014, according to Thomson Reuters data. Analysts expect first-quarter earnings to rise 11.5 percent. That "sets the stage for a stronger Q1, particularly when you look at the jobs numbers coming out and when you look at the business confidence surveys and consumer confidence surveys. There's a lot of improving sentiment," said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer for Commonwealth Financial in Waltham, Massachusetts. U.S. nonfarm payrolls had the largest increase in four months in January. "Even as the companies are talking their expectations down, consumers and businesses are likely to act on that better sentiment." The dollar index <.DXY> on Jan. 31 posted its worst start to a year in three decades, putting in a decline of 2.6 percent for January after gaining 7.1 percent in the last quarter of 2016. Comments this week by President Donald Trump and a top economics adviser suggested to some that the administration is prepared to jettison two decades of "strong dollar" policies advocated by predecessors. A strong dollar is a worry for equity investors because it makes U.S. multinationals' foreign currency earnings worth less in dollars. Nearly half of S&P 500 sales come from overseas, according to S&P-Dow Jones Indices. Executives from a slew of U.S. companies cited the strong dollar as a negative in their fourth-quarter reports and also concern about its effect on 2017 results. Among them, Apple <AAPL.O> gave a cautious outlook for the current quarter that it mainly attributed to the strong dollar, despite its upbeat fourth-quarter results. "For a company like ours where we do about two-thirds of our business outside the United States, the strong dollar presents a headwind of more than 2 percent growth," Apple Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri told Reuters. Other companies citing currency hurdles for the last quarter or for 2017 included Procter & Gamble <PG.N>, Mead Johnson Nutrition <MJN.N>, 3M Co <MMM.N> and PPG Industries <PPG.N>. Procter & Gamble said it expects combined headwinds of foreign exchange and minor brand divestitures to cut sales growth by two to three percentage points for fiscal 2017. Some strategists say the dollar is still likely to be stronger rather than weaker this year, especially given expectations for interest rate hikes for this year, but that earnings should still benefit from an improving economy. "You should get more than enough growth from the economy if you're a corporation to more than offset the rise in the dollar," said Sameer Samana, global quantitative strategist for Wells Fargo Investment Institute, which expects the dollar index to rise 7 percent by year end.

Sven Baker and Dominic Walsh The merger will see Designworks operate under the Landor name and brand as of February, combining branding and consumer experience. The move is the latest step by WPP to streamline its operations in Australia after it completed the successful takeover of STW Group last year. Designworks was an STW company and the decision to fold it into the global Landor business brings to an end the brand in Australia. Dominic Walsh is set to run the new Landor while Brad Doble – the current MD of Designworks Australia – has been appointed the managing partner in Sydney. Landor’s Nick Davis has been appointed the managing partner in Melbourne. Landor’s current clients include BP, FedEx, Singapore Airlines and Procter & Gamble while Designworks has Officeworks, Westpac and Stockland. Michael Connaghan, CEO of WPP AUNZ, said: “Landor and Designworks Australia are both outstanding businesses in their own right. Bringing them together creates a unique offering in the Australian marketing landscape; the power and strength of Landor’s global brand with the agility, the local expertise, and knowledge of Designworks. They are both highly innovative and future-focused in their approach to business, and their combined scale and capability will drive even greater value for existing and future clients.” Sven Baker, Designworks chairman and group CEO, said he was delighted to be part of Landor’s and its benefit it would have on Designworks clients. Walsh said: “I’m thrilled that we’re now partnering with them, so together we can continue to develop and grow the market opportunity in Australia.” The merger will not affect Designworks in New Zealand and it will continue business as usual.

Home Lifestyle Innovation nation: A must-read book that explores the meaning of innovation and its subset jugaad in the Indian context Innovation nation: A must-read book that explores the meaning of innovation and its subset jugaad in the Indian context The ‘missed call’ innovation is truly an Indian way of finding maximum value for any investment, says the author By: Ankita Rai | Updated: February 5, 2017 3:19 AM The ‘missed call’ innovation is truly an Indian way of finding maximum value for any investment, says the author At a time when ‘innovation’ is a buzzword and almost every Indian entrepreneur is talking about it, here comes a book that explores it in the Indian context. In Crooked Minds: Creating an Innovative Society, author Kiran Karnik takes a pragmatic view of innovation—and its subset jugaad—and addresses key challenges in setting up a culture of innovation in a company, state or society. Why should individuals, organisations or governments innovate? Is it not risky to abandon well-proven ways for an unknown, unproven approach? Is innovation the holy grail to survive in a competitive market? What are the factors that drive innovation? How can innovation be promoted? Where does India stand vis-à-vis other countries? This book answers all these questions and more. Karnik covers many facets of innovation, from business models and processes to disruptive ideas, crooked thinking and creative cheating. The book has stories of innovation stalwarts such as Uber and Airbnb, which disrupted the way business is conducted in the fields of public transport and hospitality by connecting unused resources with potential users. In the Indian context, however, the two really fascinating examples are the ‘missed call’ innovation by ZipDial and the Mumbai Insurance Scheme for people who travel in local trains in the city. The missed call innovation is truly an Indian way of finding maximum value for any investment. It was, however, not thought of by an Indian, but an American—Valerie Wagoner, the founder of ZipDial, which was acquired by Twitter in 2015 (ZipDial provides a dedicated number to its clients who then publish this number in their print and media ads, enabling interested consumers to connect with them via a missed call). Its success can be gauged from the fact that by 2015, it engaged nearly 60 million users and had more than 500 clients such as Procter & Gamble, Cadbury, Colgate, MakeMyTrip, Amazon and Uber, among others. Another interesting and innovative business model based on the Indian mindset of ‘beating the system’ is the Mumbai Insurance Scheme. The scheme insured travellers against the chance of getting caught and fined for ticketless travel on the Mumbai local at a monthly premium. Every insured ticketless traveller who got caught had to produce an official proof of paying the fine, which would get reimbursed by the insurer. The scheme, in a way, promoted ticketless travel and ended post crackdown. A similar model, however, still exists in Stockholm. Karnik writes that these examples raise the question whether crooked minds are actually innovative. Innovation, after all, means something that’s different from what exists—it could be a product, process or model. Also, individual innovation can sometimes be socially regressive. To address this dilemma, he explains how one should channelise out-of-the-box thinking for broader organisational and societal good, with various initiatives to boost individual creative ideas and, in turn, the start-up ecosystem. To create the right policy framework and ecosystem for innovation, he says, the role of states and cities is equally important as that of the Centre. Among many factors that drive innovation in India, adversity has been an important one. Adversity, however, mostly triggers jugaad. From a long-term point of view, the focus should be on promoting the fuller and sustainable form of innovation, writes Karnik, emphasising the role of industry, government and academia in promoting an innovative society.

(Screengrab: YouTube) Also Check Out {{item.title}} New York — The Super Bowl isn't just played on the field. Just as intense is a battle off the field to win viewers' attentions. Advertisers are paying $5m for just 30 seconds to reach the more than 110 million people in the U.S. expected to tune in. Which ads will be the most talked about? Which ads will be the most remembered years from now, long after the Atlanta Falcons and the New England Patriots square off? Here are 10 Super Bowl ads you have to see. 84 Lumber, "The Journey Begins" First-time Super Bowl advertiser 84 Lumber seems to wade into political territory with a 90-second spot that shows a Mexican woman and her daughter traveling across Mexico on foot. The daughter collects pieces of fabric along the way. The ad appears in the first half — without the conclusion. The ending will be shown online at halftime http://journey84.com. Watch it here:  &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;br _moz_dirty="" /&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt; Bud Light, "Ghost Spuds" Bud Light is bringing back its iconic 1980s mascot, Spuds Mackenzie, sort of. The dog appears as an unsettling T-shirted ghost. The dog eggs on a Bud Light drinker to go out and join his friends rather than sit at home alone. It's the 30th anniversary of the bull terrier's first appearance in a Bud Light ad Watch it here: &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;br _moz_dirty="" /&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt; Budweiser, "Born the Hard Way" Anheuser-Busch's cinematic 60-second spot chronicles co-founder Adolphus Busch's journey from Germany to St. Louis in 1857. He jumps off a burning steamboat and catches a glimpse of Budweiser's iconic Clydesdales mascots before meeting fellow immigrant Eberhard Anheuser. Watch it here: Honda, "Yearbooks" To promote Honda's CR-V vehicle, a 60-second second-quarter ad features high-school yearbook photos for nine celebrities — Amy Adams, Steve Carell, Viola Davis, Missy Elliott, Tina Fey, Earvin "Magic" Johnson, Jimmy Kimmel, Stan Lee and Robert Redford. The photos come to life and encourage people to follow their dreams, a nod to Honda's 15-year slogan "The Power of Dreams." The photos are actual yearbook photos, but the yearbook page surrounding them were created by the agency RPA, Honda says. Some lines were ad-libbed during filming rather than scripted. For example, Carell came up with the name "Darryl" next to him. Watch it here: &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;br _moz_dirty="" /&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt; Hyundai, "Operation Better" Hyundai enlisted director Peter Berg (Deepwater Horizon) to shoot and edit a 90-second ad during the game itself. It will air directly after the game. Teasers hint of footage from both at the Super Bowl and elsewhere. Watch it here: &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;br _moz_dirty="" /&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt; Mercedes-Benz, "Easy Driver" It's been a long time since 1969's Easy Rider brought the counterculture to the big screen. To target baby boomers, Mercedes-Benz enlisted the Coen brothers to direct an update to the tune of Steppenwolf's Born to be Wild. Bikers at a bar are furious that their bikes have been blocked by a car — until they realise it's Peter Fonda driving a Mercedes-Benz AMG Roadster. The 30-second ad is scheduled for the fourth quarter. Watch it here: Kia, "Hero's Journey" Melissa McCarthy humorously takes on political causes like saving whales, ice caps and trees, each time to disastrous effect. Kia's 60-second third-quarter ad promotes the fuel efficiency of its 2017 Niro car. Watch it here: Mr. Clean, "Cleaner of Your Dreams" P&G takes an unusual approach to promoting the kitchen cleaner, as the animated character Mr. Clean, introduced in 1958, gets some sex appeal. In the 30-second third-quarter ad, a woman in her kitchen gets distracted watching an animated Mr. Clean in tight white pants dance around her kitchen as he cleans. Watch it here: &amp;amp;lt;br _moz_dirty="" /&amp;amp;gt; Snicker's live ad Mars' Snickers brand is attempting a 30-second live ad during the first break in the third quarter. The ad features Adam Driver and a wild-west theme. Leading to the game, Snickers has a live stream at snickerslive.com with views and other content from the ad's set. Watch it here: &amp;lt;br _moz_dirty="" /&amp;gt; Squarespace, "Calling John Malkovich" Squarespace's 30-second ad slated for the first half shows a prickly John Malkovich calling the owner of JohnMalkovich.com to yell at him because he wants the domain.

The S&P 500 .SPX ended with a slight gain for the week.With earnings in from more than half the S&P 500 companies, year-over-year profit growth for the fourth quarter is now estimated at 8.0 percent, up from 6.1 percent forecast at the start of January, and on track to be the strongest since the third quarter of 2014, according to Thomson Reuters data. Analysts expect first-quarter earnings to rise 11.5 percent.That "sets the stage for a stronger Q1, particularly when you look at the jobs numbers coming out and when you look at the business confidence surveys and consumer confidence surveys. There's a lot of improving sentiment," said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer for Commonwealth Financial in Waltham, Massachusetts.U.S. nonfarm payrolls had the largest increase in four months in January. "Even as the companies are talking their expectations down, consumers and businesses are likely to act on that better sentiment."The dollar index .DXY on Jan. 31 posted its worst start to a year in three decades, putting in a decline of 2.6 percent for January after gaining 7.1 percent in the last quarter of 2016.Comments this week by President Donald Trump and a top economics adviser suggested to some that the administration is prepared to jettison two decades of "strong dollar" policies advocated by predecessors. A strong dollar is a worry for equity investors because it makes U.S. multinationals' foreign currency earnings worth less in dollars. Nearly half of S&P 500 sales come from overseas, according to S&P-Dow Jones Indices.Executives from a slew of U.S. companies cited the strong dollar as a negative in their fourth-quarter reports and also concern about its effect on 2017 results.Among them, Apple (AAPL.O) gave a cautious outlook for the current quarter that it mainly attributed to the strong dollar, despite its upbeat fourth-quarter results."For a company like ours where we do about two-thirds of our business outside the United States, the strong dollar presents a headwind of more than 2 percent growth," Apple Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri told Reuters. Other companies citing currency hurdles for the last quarter or for 2017 included Procter & Gamble (PG.N), Mead Johnson Nutrition (MJN.N), 3M Co (MMM.N) and PPG Industries (PPG.N).Procter & Gamble said it expects combined headwinds of foreign exchange and minor brand divestitures to cut sales growth by two to three percentage points for fiscal 2017.Some strategists say the dollar is still likely to be stronger rather than weaker this year, especially given expectations for interest rate hikes for this year, but that earnings should still benefit from an improving economy."You should get more than enough growth from the economy if you're a corporation to more than offset the rise in the dollar," said Sameer Samana, global quantitative strategist for Wells Fargo Investment Institute, which expects the dollar index to rise 7 percent by year end.

NEW YORK: Stock investors could have at least one less worry in the next earnings period: the suddenly limp U.S. dollar. The greenback, whose strong rally after the Nov. 8 U.S. election hit profits at many U.S. multinationals in the fourth quarter, has had a sharp reversal since the start of the year. Coupled with comments suggesting that the Trump administration favors a weaker currency, that could shift the picture for the current quarter. Fourth-quarter results, even with the dollar's drag, are mostly beating Wall Street's expectations and helping provide a buffer to some of the uncertainties facing investors, including the new U.S. president's policies. The S&P 500 ended with a slight gain for the week. With earnings in from more than half the S&P 500 companies, year-over-year profit growth for the fourth quarter is now estimated at 8.0 percent, up from 6.1 percent forecast at the start of January, and on track to be the strongest since the third quarter of 2014, according to Thomson Reuters data.

The greenback, whose strong rally after the Nov. 8 US election hit profits at many US multinationals in the fourth quarter, has had a sharp reversal since the start of the year. Coupled with comments suggesting that the Trump administration favours a weaker currency, that could shift the picture for the current quarter. Fourth-quarter results, even with the dollar's drag, are mostly beating Wall Street's expectations and helping provide a buffer to some of the uncertainties facing investors, including the new US president's policies. The S&P 500 ended with a slight gain for the week. With earnings in from more than half the S&P 500 companies, year-over-year profit growth for the fourth quarter is now estimated at 8.0 per cent, up from 6.1 per cent forecast at the start of January, and on track to be the strongest since the third quarter of 2014, according to Thomson Reuters data. Analysts expect first-quarter earnings to rise 11.5 per cent. That "sets the stage for a stronger Q1, particularly when you look at the jobs numbers coming out and when you look at the business confidence surveys and consumer confidence surveys. There's a lot of improving sentiment," said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer for Commonwealth Financial in Waltham, Massachusetts. US nonfarm payrolls had the largest increase in four months in January. "Even as the companies are talking their expectations down, consumers and businesses are likely to act on that better sentiment." The dollar index on Jan. 31 posted its worst start to a year in three decades, putting in a decline of 2.6 per cent for January after gaining 7.1 per cent in the last quarter of 2016. Comments this week by President Donald Trump and a top economics adviser suggested to some that the administration is prepared to jettison two decades of "strong dollar" policies advocated by predecessors. A strong dollar is a worry for equity investors because it makes US multinationals' foreign currency earnings worth less in dollars. Nearly half of S&P 500 sales come from overseas, according to S&P-Dow Jones Indices. Executives from a slew of US companies cited the strong dollar as a negative in their fourth-quarter reports and also concern about its effect on 2017 results. Among them, Apple gave a cautious outlook for the current quarter that it mainly attributed to the strong dollar, despite its upbeat fourth-quarter results. "For a company like ours where we do about two-thirds of our business outside the United States, the strong dollar presents a headwind of more than 2 per cent growth," Apple Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri told Reuters. Other companies citing currency hurdles for the last quarter or for 2017 included Procter & Gamble, Mead Johnson Nutrition, 3M Co and PPG Industries. Procter & Gamble said it expects combined headwinds of foreign exchange and minor brand divestitures to cut sales growth by two to three percentage points for fiscal 2017. Some strategists say the dollar is still likely to be stronger rather than weaker this year, especially given expectations for interest rate hikes for this year, but that earnings should still benefit from an improving economy. "You should get more than enough growth from the economy if you're a corporation to more than offset the rise in the dollar," said Sameer Samana, global quantitative strategist for Wells Fargo Investment Institute, which expects the dollar index to rise 7 per cent by year end. < Previous PageNext Page > Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

Helen McGuire, the co-founder and managing director of Hopscotch - which seeks to help women, particularly those who have taken a time off, to get back into the workforce - noted that many talented women are currently out in the workforce. "Specifically in this region, we live with such a diverse population. What we found is that women who come over with their husbands or have children feel very excluded from the work force, and are not able to go back part-time because of family commitments," she said. "The UAE has the highest, most educated female population anywhere in the world, as per the World Bank, but the employment rate is actually half that. It doesn't take a mathematician to work out what's been lost in the workforce." McGuire noted that companies would be well advised to take advantage of the diversity of backgrounds, languages and skills available among the women in the UAE. "By including them, you are automatically doubling the skill set that you have available in this region," she said. "The benefits are fairly obvious. Many regional headquarters are based here, so you can have people with the backgrounds and languages that you need to communicate with the local offices. "Work gets done more quickly, and you have an understanding of how things work, she said. "What works in Lebanon might not work in Saudi Arabia." Giving an example, McGuire noted that having employees of a certain nationality can help foreigners navigate the often complex and varied social interactions they might encounter while conducting business in other countries. "When I moved here, for example, I wasn't aware of all the cultural differences when working in a country like Saudi (Arabia)," she said. "The benefit is that you learn very quickly. Do you shake hands? Do you not? Do you kiss on a cheek, or do three kisses even? It can obviously give the wrong impression if you do the wrong thing." One woman's experiences Among the companies working to diversify their female workforce is Proctor&Gamble (P&G), which was named as one of the top companies for multi-cultural women in the USA in 2016. In their UAE office alone, 43 per cent of 280 employees are women, from 29 nationalities. "I enjoy what I do greatly, and much of that satisfaction is down to working in a multicultural environment where I'm able to learn from others about their cultures, their thought processes and how they communicate," said Seema Balwani, Arabian Peninsula finance manager of the company. "Working in a multicultural environment has enabled me to grow as a person, make new friendships from around the world and understand the diversity of my company's suppliers, customers and consumers. "I've become a better listener, an active listener who wants to learn about new things, such as culture. I've also learned to value differences, to understand that diversity and inclusion are positive for the team and the organisation," she added. Multicultural environments promote discussion." Balwani added that she believed that working in a multicultural environment "helps to shape careers." Lastly, Balwani added that having diverse women on the job brings "diversity of thought." - bernd@khaleejtimes.com Bernd Debusmann Jr. Originally from Mexico City, I've been in Dubai since January 2015.

Bud Light is re-introducing the brand’s ’80s pop culture icon and man’s best friend, Spuds MacKenzie. (Bud Light via AP) By MAE ANDERSON THE ASSOCIATED PRESS NEW YORK — The Super Bowl isn’t just played on the field. Just as intense is a battle off the field to win viewers’ attentions. Advertisers are paying $5 million for 30 seconds to reach the more than 110 million people in the U.S. expected to tune in. Which ads will be the most talked about? Which ads will be the most remembered years from now, long after the Atlanta Falcons and the New England Patriots square off? Here are 10 Super Bowl ads to watch during Sunday’s broadcast on Fox. 84 LUMBER, “THE JOURNEY BEGINS” First-time Super Bowl advertiser 84 Lumber seems to wade into political territory with a 90-second spot that shows a Mexican woman and her daughter traveling across Mexico on foot. The daughter collects pieces of fabric along the way. The ad appears in the first half — without the conclusion. The ending will be shown online at halftime at http://journey84.com. BUD LIGHT, “GHOST SPUDS” Bud Light is bringing back its iconic 1980s mascot, Spuds Mackenzie, sort of. The dog appears as an unsettling T-shirted ghost. The dog eggs on a Bud Light drinker to go out and join his friends rather than sit at home alone. It’s the 30th anniversary of the bull terrier’s first appearance in a Bud Light ad. The 90-second ad is running during the fourth quarter. BUDWEISER, “BORN THE HARD WAY” Anheuser-Busch’s cinematic 60-second spot chronicles co-founder Adolphus Busch’s journey from Germany to St. Louis in 1857. He jumps off a burning steamboat and catches a glimpse of Budweiser’s iconic Clydesdales mascots before meeting fellow immigrant Eberhard Anheuser. The second-quarter ad became topical since it was released online Tuesday, just days after President Donald Trump signed an executive order to temporarily ban refugees and nearly all citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries. Anheuser-Busch, which started working on the ad in May, says the ad isn’t making a political statement. HONDA, “YEARBOOKS” To promote Honda’s CR-V vehicle, a 60-second second-quarter ad features high-school yearbook photos for nine celebrities — Amy Adams, Steve Carell, Viola Davis, Missy Elliott, Tina Fey, Earvin “Magic” Johnson, Jimmy Kimmel, Stan Lee and Robert Redford. The photos come to life and encourage people to follow their dreams, a nod to Honda’s 15-year slogan “The Power of Dreams.” The photos are actual yearbook photos, but the yearbook page surrounding them were created by the agency RPA, Honda says. Some lines were ad-libbed during filming rather than scripted. For example, Carell came up with the name “Darryl” next to him. HYUNDAI, “OPERATION BETTER” Hyundai enlisted director Peter Berg (“Deepwater Horizon”) to shoot and edit a 90-second ad during the game itself. It will air directly after the game. Teasers hint of footage from both at the Super Bowl and elsewhere. MERCEDES-BENZ, “EASY DRIVER” It’s been a long time since 1969’s “Easy Rider” brought the counterculture to the big screen. To target baby boomers, Mercedes-Benz enlisted the Coen brothers to direct an update to the tune of Steppenwolf’s “Born to be Wild.” Bikers at a bar are furious that their bikes have been blocked by a car — until they realize it’s Peter Fonda driving a Mercedes-Benz AMG Roadster. The 30-second ad is scheduled for the fourth quarter. KIA, “HERO’S JOURNEY” Melissa McCarthy humorously takes on political causes such as saving whales, ice caps and trees, each time to disastrous effect. Kia’s 60-second third-quarter ad promotes the fuel efficiency of its 2017 Niro car. MR. CLEAN, “CLEANER OF YOUR DREAMS” P&G takes an unusual approach to promoting the kitchen cleaner, as the animated character Mr. Clean, introduced in 1958, gets some sex appeal. In the 30-second third-quarter ad, a woman in her kitchen gets distracted watching an animated Mr. Clean in tight white pants dance around her kitchen as he cleans. SNICKER’S LIVE AD Mars’ Snickers brand is attempting a 30-second live ad during the first break in the third quarter. The ad features Adam Driver and a wild-west theme. Leading to the game, Snickers has a live stream at snickerslive.com with views and other content from the ad’s set. Snickers says it’s doing plenty of rehearsals and turning to multiple satellite feeds to make sure the ad goes off without a hitch. SQUARESPACE, “CALLING JOHN MALKOVICH” Squarespace’s 30-second ad slated for the first half shows a prickly John Malkovich calling the owner of JohnMalkovich.com to yell at him because he wants the domain.

The greenback, whose strong rally after the Nov. 8 U.S. election hit profits at many U.S. multinationals in the fourth quarter, has had a sharp reversal since the start of the year. Coupled with comments suggesting that the Trump administration favors a weaker currency, that could shift the picture for the current quarter. Fourth-quarter results, even with the dollar's drag, are mostly beating Wall Street's expectations and helping provide a buffer to some of the uncertainties facing investors, including the new U.S. president's policies. The S&P 500 ended with a slight gain for the week. With earnings in from more than half the S&P 500 companies, year-over-year profit growth for the fourth quarter is now estimated at 8.0 percent, up from 6.1 percent forecast at the start of January, and on track to be the strongest since the third quarter of 2014, according to Thomson Reuters data. Analysts expect first-quarter earnings to rise 11.5 percent. That "sets the stage for a stronger Q1, particularly when you look at the jobs numbers coming out and when you look at the business confidence surveys and consumer confidence surveys. There's a lot of improving sentiment," said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer for Commonwealth Financial in Waltham, Massachusetts. U.S. nonfarm payrolls had the largest increase in four months in January. "Even as the companies are talking their expectations down, consumers and businesses are likely to act on that better sentiment." The dollar index on Jan. 31 posted its worst start to a year in three decades, putting in a decline of 2.6 percent for January after gaining 7.1 percent in the last quarter of 2016. Comments this week by President Donald Trump and a top economics adviser suggested to some that the administration is prepared to jettison two decades of "strong dollar" policies advocated by predecessors. A strong dollar is a worry for equity investors because it makes U.S. multinationals' foreign currency earnings worth less in dollars. Nearly half of S&P 500 sales come from overseas, according to S&P-Dow Jones Indices. Executives from a slew of U.S. companies cited the strong dollar as a negative in their fourth-quarter reports and also concern about its effect on 2017 results. Among them, Apple gave a cautious outlook for the current quarter that it mainly attributed to the strong dollar, despite its upbeat fourth-quarter results. "For a company like ours where we do about two-thirds of our business outside the United States, the strong dollar presents a headwind of more than 2 percent growth," Apple Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri told Reuters. Other companies citing currency hurdles for the last quarter or for 2017 included Procter & Gamble, Mead Johnson Nutrition, 3M Co and PPG Industries. Procter & Gamble said it expects combined headwinds of foreign exchange and minor brand divestitures to cut sales growth by two to three percentage points for fiscal 2017. Some strategists say the dollar is still likely to be stronger rather than weaker this year, especially given expectations for interest rate hikes for this year, but that earnings should still benefit from an improving economy. "You should get more than enough growth from the economy if you're a corporation to more than offset the rise in the dollar," said Sameer Samana, global quantitative strategist for Wells Fargo Investment Institute, which expects the dollar index to rise 7 percent by year end.

Jeremy Bowman (TMFHobo) Feb 5, 2017 at 11:24AM Image source: Motley Fool. What happened Shares of Revlon, Inc. (NYSE:REV) surged last month after the company announced a restructuring plan. According to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, the stock gained 15%. The bulk of the increase came in the middle of the month when the restructuring plan was announced. So what  The cosmetics giant, which has struggled in recent years, said it would restructure its brands into four separate divisions. The company said the new structure would help it meet its long-term growth aspirations, following the successful acquisition of Elizabeth Arden last September. The brand-centric structure will be based around the Revlon, Elizabeth Arden, Fragrances, and Portfolio Brands divisions. CEO Fabian Garcia said the new model will "leverage the strength of our brands, and better focus on and serve our beauty customers." The stock jumped 7% the day the deal was announced. Now what  Revlon shares have been volatile in recent years as legacy cosmetic companies have struggled with the rise of competition from new store-based brands like Sephora, Mac, and Ulta. Elizabeth Arden, which it bought in September, saw its value significantly erode, and Procter & Gamble recently sold its Cover Girl line to Coty. Wall Street often cheers restructuring plans, and it makes sense to do one after an acquisition like Elizabeth Arden. We will learn more when Revlon reports earnings later this month.
