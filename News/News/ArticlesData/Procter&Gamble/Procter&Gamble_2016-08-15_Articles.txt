(ATVI), Coty Inc (COTY) and Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT) Are 3 of Today’s Worst Stocks ATVI, COTY and LMT stock dished out more misery than most stocks did on Tuesday By James Brumley, InvestorPlace Feature Writer  |  Aug 16, 2016, 4:49 pm EST     Popular Posts: 10 Small-Cap Stocks That Could Double in 2017 Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock Is Due for Even BIGGER Gains 5 Retail Stocks That May Not Be Around Next Christmas Recent Posts: Eli Lilly and Co (LLY) Drug Failure Doesn’t Answer the Bigger Question The Dow Jones Is Completely Defying Expectations Why Medtronic PLC (MDT), Dycom Industries, Inc. (DY) and Palo Alto Networks Inc (PANW) Are 3 of Today’s Worst Stocks View All Posts Tepid inflation, solid housing starts and better-than-expected industrial productivity for July left investors a bit confused on Tuesday. Fanning the flames of indecision was the “wait and see” mindset in front of Wednesday’s release of the minutes from the most recent Federal Open Market Committee meeting. By the time the closing bell rang, the S&P 500 was back at 2178.15, down 0.55%, and ending the session near last week’s average closing level. Not every stock simply coasted lower on Tuesday, however. Activision Blizzard, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATVI), Coty Inc (NYSE:COTY) and Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) all logged much bigger losses, but for understandable reasons. Activision Blizzard, Inc. (ATVI) In the grand scheme of things investors may worry about it too much — it’s not always relevant when a company insider sells a big chunk of his or her shares. It’s even less relevant when those shares are sold not so much to put the proceeds in someone’s pocket, but rather, as part of estate planning measures for someone else. All the same, shareholders were a bit rattled today when Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick and Chairman Brian Kelly sold $709 million worth of ATVI — almost half of their collective position — for estate planning purposes. The two still own more than 37 million shares of ATVI between them, or about $1.48 billion worth of the $29.7 billion company. The market still mostly interpreted it as a sign that the two top guys are losing faith in the firm. 7 Stocks to Sell or Short Into the Ground ATVI closed 5% lower on Tuesday. Coty Inc (COTY) Beauty product maker Coty was down close to 5% when the company acknowledged in its fourth-quarter results that the purchase of some now-former Procter & Gamble Co (NYSE:PG) has proven a bit costlier than expected. The good news is that Coty topped expectations for last quarter’s top and bottom line. The company earned an operating profit of 13 cents per share on $1.08 billion in sales, versus analyst estimates for earnings of 6 cents per share of COTY and revenue of $1.05 billion. The bad news is, the integration of P&G’s beauty brands like Hugo Boss fragrances and cosmetics brand Covergirl haven’t been cheap. The cost to hammer out the melding of the purchased assets doubled to a little more than $90 million last quarter, leaving COTY shareholders to wonder how much more unexpected cost is in the cards. Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT) Activision Blizzard was hardly alone in the gutter today. Defense contractor Lockheed Martin also saw its shares fall by 4% when the company reported a recent spin-off had not borne the fruit it was supposed to. Is the End of Obamacare Nigh? The spin-off of Lockheed Martin’s IT business to Leidos was lauded when it was first unveiled in January. Information technology isn’t quite Lockheed’s milieu, and although it is profitable, it was a pain to operate. Most believed LMT would be better serviced by focusing on equipment, and even Lockheed Martin suggested cutting loose the unit would ultimately allow it to retire some LMT. As it turns out, not so much. The market was expecting the deal to lead to the retirement of 10 million shares of LMT, but when the details of spin-off were released with the official completion of the deal, the tally was only 9.4 million shares retired. As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

By Josh Kolm August 16, 2016 McCann’s newest additions, from left to right: Meghan Sherwin, Angela Gill, Jim Chestnutt and Jeff Perrin. McCann Canada has made another investment in strategy, planning and experiential with four additions to its Toronto office. Leading the hires is Meghan Sherwin as VP of strategic planning. Sherwin joined in May after nearly two years as VP of planning at Cheil Canada, having also had lengthy terms on the account teams at BBDO, Digital Cement and Leo Burnett. Among her credits are the “Kraft First Taste” program and the launch of the Gillette Proglide for P&G. Sherwin will report to Mary Chambers, chief strategy officer at McCann Canada. Her former position at Cheil was filled last month when the agency hired Scott Suthren from Innocean Worldwide Canada. “Meghan is a true integrated strategist, seamlessly moving through the worlds of traditional, digital, social, retail and events – simply building the best strategy for brands,” said Chambers in a release. The other three additions have joined the account team at Momentum, the agency’s experiential and engagement division. “Our team has been expanding rapidly due to tremendous organic growth and new business wins,” said Matt Lewis, managing director of Momentum Canada, who himself joined the agency earlier this year. “These newest additions to the team elevate our skill set across sponsorship, content and event production, but what we’re most excited about are the leadership qualities inherent in each of them.” Angela Gill has been hired as group account director at Momentum, having most recently been at SDI Marketing, where she helped launched the Rogers Hometown Hockey program. Gill has a mix of client- and agency-side experience, having previously worked as director of sponsorship strategy at Canadian Tire, group account director at Cossette, manager of marketing at CBC and manager of marketing programs at Molson Coors. Also joining Momentum are account directors Jim Chestnutt and Jeff Perrin. Chestnutt is an events producer with more than ten years of experience, having worked on events that helped to launch Nike.com and Miller Lite in Canada, as well as activations for RBC and Virgin Mobile. Perrin, most recently executive producer for the Academy of Canadian Cinema and Television, has a background in live TV and talent management in addition to events and sponsorship, having worked on productions including The Canadian Country Music Awards, The Canadian Screen Awards and the Scotiabank Giller Prize, as well as a stint at Bristow Global Media as sponsorship director for W Network’s Hockey Wives. McCann also added to the Momentum team with three hires that came earlier this year as part of growth across all the agency’s departments. In March, the agency hired Josh Stein to be its new ECD in Toronto and, last month, gave a send off to the “MacLaren” name as it adopted the McCann Canada brand.

CNN Money2:31 UP NEXT Stocks rose Monday, with the three major indexes posting simultaneous record closes for the second time in less than a week as investors digested rising oil prices.  Quotes in the article Red Rock Resorts Inc RRR ▲ 23.15 +0.01 +0.02% Sysco Corp SYY ▼ 53.46 -0.64 -1.18% Noah Holdings Ltd NOAH ▲ 24.65 +0.08 +0.33% "The fundamental picture has been mixed, so it's a little bit hard to look to that as the reason for what seems to be a solid rally," said Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank. He also noted that Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's lead in the polls over her GOP counterpart, Donald Trump, may be a contributing factor to the recent rally. "Not to make a statement on which candidate is better, but usually markets prefer for the incumbent party to retain the White House." The three indexes also posted new intraday highs, as benchmark S&P 500 and the Nasdaq composite broke above previous intraday highs of 2,188.45 and 5,238.54, respectively, shortly after the open.  The Dow Jones industrial average also posted a record high, rising past its previous high of 18,638.34. These previous records were all set last week, despite the indexes posting just slight weekly gains. "It's a major vacation time between now and Labor day," said Ernie Cecilia, CIO at Bryn Mawr Trust. "The market right now is floating up on not a lot of news." "There's a lack of alternatives into other instruments," he said, noting that trading volume has been low recently. The S&P gained 0.28 percent, with materials leading. Twenty-nine S&P components hit new 52-week highs, including Sysco — which reported quarterly results before the bell, Ross Stores and Procter & Gamble. "The market is being driven by the same theme," said Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at Baird, referring to low interest rates around the world and the "hunt for yield." "Until we get some optimism, the path of least resistance is higher. Nobody likes this market." The Dow rose 59 points, with Boeing and Goldman Sachs contributing the most gains. The Nasdaq added 0.56 percent. "The market should continue to go higher on the no-alternative factor," said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial. "The market is feeding on itself." "In order to get a big move down, ... you need to see some news the market perceives as bad," said Randy Frederick, managing director of trading and derivatives at Charles Schwab. "We don't have that right now." Despite posting several milestones last week, stocks traded in a relatively narrow range. The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), widely considered the best gauge of fear in the market, traded near multi-year lows last week. On Monday, it traded about 1.5 percent higher, around 11.75. Investors, meanwhile, were watching oil prices as U.S. crude settled 2.81 percent higher at $45.74 a barrel in choppy trade. On Monday, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak bolstered hopes that oil producing nations could take action to stabilize prices, telling a Saudi newspaper that his country was consulting with Saudi Arabia and other producers to achieve market stability. "Good luck with that, if investors believe this. The move which we are seeing in the market is the real example how speculations can drive the price action. If you look at the demand equation, we had GDP data from the third biggest economy in the world and it is not something which is praising the demand for oil," said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets. On the data front, the Empire State Manufacturing survey index fell five points to -4.2. "The lack of even a whiff of volatility, however, prevents me from shifting my outlook from neutral to something more far more negative. The intraday range for the blue chip index has consistently fallen to 0.25-0.50% of the underlying index level. When this statistic falls into this tight band, the blue chips have secured a positive daily return 67.7% of the time since October 2001 compared to 54.5% for all sessions over the same period," Jeremy Klein, chief market strategist at FBN Securities, said in a Monday note to clients. Other data released Monday included the NAHB housing index, which showed homebuilder sentiment rose 2 points. The SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB) rose about 1 percent, led higher by Toll Brothers, which was up about 3 percent. Investors will also await for the Fed to release the minutes from its July meeting, although Schwab's Frederick said that he doesn't expect any big surprises from them. On the earnings front, several firms, including Home Depot, Lowe's and Cisco Systems, are scheduled to report results this week. "Through Friday's close, 459 companies, or 92%, of S&P 500 have reported 2Q 2016 results," said Nick Raich, CEO at The Earnings Scout, in a Monday note. "While 71% of those companies are exceeding their 2Q 2016 EPS estimates, 60% have had their 3Q 2016 EPS estimate go lower, on average by -1.79%, after releasing results."

(Getty) Allyson Felix clocked 49.67 seconds, the fastest time in Sunday’s 400-meter semifinals, to win the heat and advance to Monday’s final. The 30-year-old U.S. sprinter, who is the 2015 400-meter world champion, is running the individual 400-meter for the first time at the Rio Olympics. “I’m just a competitor. I love to win. I love a challenge,” Felix told Yahoo Sports. “I have had success before but I think your goals just kind of shift. For me, that’s really what this year is about. I’m excited to get outside of my comfort zone to take on this new event in the 400 and see where it takes me.” As Felix aims for another gold medal, here’s everything you need to know about her growing wealth. 1. She Has a Net Worth Estimated at $8.5 Million Allyson Felix celebrates after winning the women’s 200-meter dash final at the U.S. Olympic track and field trials in 2012. (Getty) Felix is one of the most accomplished sprinters in U.S. track and field history. Her success has led to lucrative endorsements, and appearances. Felix currently has a net worth estimated at $8.5 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth. If she captures gold Monday night, that figure will likely increase with more sponsorship deals.

She Turned Pro After High School & Signed With Adidas As a senior, Felix broke Marion Jones’ national high-school record in the 200-meter. She went on to qualify for the world championships at the U.S. Nationals meet– held just a day after her graduation. Days before beginning her college career at University of Southern California, Felix forfeited her scholarship and NCAA eligibility by turning pro. At the time, she signed a reported six-year, $1-million-plus contract with Adidas in 2004. Adidas would later pick up the cost of her college tuition. Felix graduated from USC with a degree in elementary education in 2008. 3. She Signed an Endorsement Deal With Nike in 2010 Allyson Felix tests out Nike’s new new basketball and training technology at Basketball City, Pier 36 in 2012. (Getty) After six years with Adidas, Felix signed with their top competitor. In 2010, Felix entered into an agreement with Nike, which helped fund her training for the London Games. She has been a part of their 2011 ‘Make Yourself Proud’ campaign and endorsed the Nike “Free” shoe system. The three-time Olympian also fronted Nike’s Spring/Summer Women’s Lookbook in 2013. Felix was featured in their ‘Find Your Fast’ campaign last July to “inspire athletes to run or train for their fastest time.” Felix has additional sponsorships from Acuvue, Procter & Gamble, AT&T and Gatorade.

She Has Earned $130,000 From Olympic Medals Allyson Felix has won four Olympic gold medals. (Getty) Felix will race a talented field in the 400 meters on on Monday night in Rio as she aims for her second individual gold medal and fifth gold medal overall. She also has won two silver medals. American athletes winning medals at the Olympic games receive a cash prize from the U.S. Olympic Committee. The awards vary based on the medal won. Those awards are on top of the actual value of a “gold” medal – which is around $366 for the Rio games. The gold medal is a mixture of a small amount of 24-karat gold, some copper and a lot of sterling silver, according to Time. With four gold and two silver, Felix has earned $130,000 in cash payouts. That total is based on $25,000 for each of the four Olympic gold medals Felix has won, plus $15,000 for each of her two silvers. Felix, who is arguably one of the most impressive athletes of the decade, has won more world championship gold medals than any other U.S. track and field athlete. In addition to her Olympic medals, she holds 19 medals from international competition. Aside from a high medal count, the California native was recognized as one of Glamour’s Women of The Year in 2012. She was also awarded the 2012 Female Athlete of the Year from the IAAF where she posed alongside Usain Bolt and Prince Albert of Monaco at the prestigious ceremony. Felix serves as a member of Barack Obama’s Council on Fitness, Sports and Nutrition alongside fellow athletes including Saints quarterback Drew Brees, and figure skating legend Michelle Kwan. “The Council will play an important role in our effort to help combat childhood obesity in this country, and I am grateful to the athletes, chefs, doctors and nutrition experts who are volunteering their time on the Council to help make a difference,” First Lady Michelle Obama said following the council appointment in 2010.

Her Brother Is Her Agent How @allysonfelix's brother Wes helped her win Olympic gold. http://t.co/Rez0pT5NCo pic.twitter.com/pkV9hKjZqq — The Players' Tribune (@PlayersTribune) September 24, 2015 In an article Felix wrote for The Players’ Tribune last fall, she opened up about her biggest inspiration: her older brother Wes. Felix revealed she was always in awe of his athletic ability, and was inspired to follow in his footsteps. Like his sister, he grew up in pursuit of an athletic career in track and field. In 2002, Wes was the USA Junior Champion in the 200-meter in 2002 and the Pac 10 champion in the 200-meter in both 2003 and 2004 while running for USC. Felix wrote that her brother has offered unwavering support throughout her career. After Felix’s crushing second-place finishes at the 2004 and 2008 Olympics, Wes was there to encourage her. Not long after the Beijing Games, however, he was diagnosed with a liver virus which immediately ended his own athletic career. Wes turned his attention to another aspect of the sport: serving as his sister’s agent. Since then, he’s helped her gain several new sponsorship deals, and has been her mentor. “My recovery from the injury in 2013 and redemption at the 2015 World Championships would not be possible without the encouragement and advice he’s provided over the years,” Felix wrote. “As I build on this success, I do it with the utmost confidence that one of the essential constants in my life -my brother — is here to help me along the way. Thank you, Wes.” Allyson Felix’s Family: 5 Fast Facts You Need to Know U.S. sprinter Allyson Felix aims for her fifth gold medal tonight in the individual 400-meter.

Warc's Lucy Aitken interviewed him earlier this month. What is your take on the role of comms planning versus creative planning? Where you talk to people and how you engage with them is becoming more important because increasingly, people can opt out of advertising completely. If you subscribe to Netflix or use an ad blocker, for instance, you can avoid a lot of advertising. So now you start with where to put the messaging and that's now defining the canvas the message goes into. People's paid media is decreasing – they don't have the budgets to achieve cut-through on TV anymore - so they have to do something else.  For instance, we want to reach gamers because the graphics on the Samsung Galaxy S7 are really good. But we're finding that gamers tend to have ad blockers so we're looking at in-stream advertising because they can't block that. Then you have to look at how you work around those things and add value.    What has been the most useful new platform to emerge in the past five years? Facebook. Social is overtaking search and Facebook has moved into messaging and live video. It just edges past Google, but between them, Google and Facebook take 65% of all adspend now.   What criteria do you use to assess an emerging platform? In terms of the latest tech, we have a relationship with start-ups where we've worked really hard to sort out contracts and processes. We've had lots of success in getting projects off the ground with the likes of P&G and Samsung. When we look at start-ups, the areas we're seeing most people cluster around are mobile, social and market research and, broadly, the partners we're bringing in are in those areas. User-generated content is another area where we're able to plug into existing clients to help them adapt and move into emerging areas. Innovation at scale is about working with partners to move from a £10k test to a multi-market spend. We introduced Snapchat filters for Samsung Galaxy S7 and scaled it across 23 markets. It's about how you scale. Rather than 'test and learn' which always feels a bit passive, you've got to go big and go big quickly! If something has worked, it's about how you can rapidly push it across markets.   Spotify and Clear Channel claim that 100% of their inventory will be automated within five years. Will this also be the case for your business? The long tail, yes. But there will always be a need for deep meaning that resonates with people. There's one way of looking at a customer journey or a customer experience where you look at each step and how you make it better. The other way is to look at the highs and lows of that experience – so what do you remember a week later after that experience? If you're shopping, a good interaction at a cash desk in terms of a rational reading would never come through because check-out took 53% longer than a benchmark. Yet the customer had a nice conversation with cashier. That's the danger of too much automation - we're not robots.   What will future media agencies look like? How do they need to adapt? They need to be more fluid and flexible and that takes a hell of a lot of thinking about how you bake in agility to massive organisations. It comes back to clients, the questions they have and how you address them. You can see media agencies splitting into one part that's about automated buying - the heavily data-driven direct response model of agencies – and another part that's about understanding people rather than thinking that everything can be run off algorithms.   How does 'moment marketing' change the nature of comms planning? Context has always been central to media. What we have now is more data to understand those moments. We could disappear into a world of hyper-personalisation and hyper-granularity without creating those big moments that bring people together. Marc Pritchard at P&G has talked about moving away from so much targeting and personalisation because they don't need it. There's a great thing with Coke where they found that sales went up when it snowed heavily because schools shut early and the kids were allowed out to play. They all went to a store and bought Coke. That makes snow days a big enough 'moment' on the happiness platform. Can you cite an example of how data helped you uncover a surprising insight that informed future comms planning? We found out from a client that there was a massive spike every year in cold and flu medicine when people get a cold. Yet unless they have a cold, they don't think about cold medicine. We used to advertise in December, but by that time they could have missed the season by a month. We looked at social data and at Twitter, and we could see that British people like to have a whinge about having flu. So we created these comedic videos to cheer them up in response to that. We would never have got there without seeing those data patterns.   Warc's Media Awards recognise comms planning which has made a significant impact on business results.

CNN Money2:31 UP NEXT Stocks rose Monday, with the three major indexes posting simultaneous record closes for the second time in less than a week as investors digested rising oil prices.  Quotes in the article Red Rock Resorts Inc RRR ▲ 23.15 +0.01 +0.02% Sysco Corp SYY ▼ 53.46 -0.64 -1.18% Noah Holdings Ltd NOAH ▲ 24.65 +0.08 +0.33% "The fundamental picture has been mixed, so it's a little bit hard to look to that as the reason for what seems to be a solid rally," said Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank. He also noted that Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's lead in the polls over her GOP counterpart, Donald Trump, may be a contributing factor to the recent rally. "Not to make a statement on which candidate is better, but usually markets prefer for the incumbent party to retain the White House." The three indexes also posted new intraday highs, as benchmark S&P 500 and the Nasdaq composite broke above previous intraday highs of 2,188.45 and 5,238.54, respectively, shortly after the open.  The Dow Jones industrial average also posted a record high, rising past its previous high of 18,638.34. These previous records were all set last week, despite the indexes posting just slight weekly gains. "It's a major vacation time between now and Labor day," said Ernie Cecilia, CIO at Bryn Mawr Trust. "The market right now is floating up on not a lot of news." "There's a lack of alternatives into other instruments," he said, noting that trading volume has been low recently. The S&P gained 0.28 percent, with materials leading. Twenty-nine S&P components hit new 52-week highs, including Sysco — which reported quarterly results before the bell, Ross Stores and Procter & Gamble. "The market is being driven by the same theme," said Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at Baird, referring to low interest rates around the world and the "hunt for yield." "Until we get some optimism, the path of least resistance is higher. Nobody likes this market." The Dow rose 59 points, with Boeing and Goldman Sachs contributing the most gains. The Nasdaq added 0.56 percent. "The market should continue to go higher on the no-alternative factor," said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial. "The market is feeding on itself." "In order to get a big move down, ... you need to see some news the market perceives as bad," said Randy Frederick, managing director of trading and derivatives at Charles Schwab. "We don't have that right now." Despite posting several milestones last week, stocks traded in a relatively narrow range. The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), widely considered the best gauge of fear in the market, traded near multi-year lows last week. On Monday, it traded about 1.5 percent higher, around 11.75. Investors, meanwhile, were watching oil prices as U.S. crude settled 2.81 percent higher at $45.74 a barrel in choppy trade. On Monday, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak bolstered hopes that oil producing nations could take action to stabilize prices, telling a Saudi newspaper that his country was consulting with Saudi Arabia and other producers to achieve market stability. "Good luck with that, if investors believe this. The move which we are seeing in the market is the real example how speculations can drive the price action. If you look at the demand equation, we had GDP data from the third biggest economy in the world and it is not something which is praising the demand for oil," said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets. On the data front, the Empire State Manufacturing survey index fell five points to -4.2. "The lack of even a whiff of volatility, however, prevents me from shifting my outlook from neutral to something more far more negative. The intraday range for the blue chip index has consistently fallen to 0.25-0.50% of the underlying index level. When this statistic falls into this tight band, the blue chips have secured a positive daily return 67.7% of the time since October 2001 compared to 54.5% for all sessions over the same period," Jeremy Klein, chief market strategist at FBN Securities, said in a Monday note to clients. Other data released Monday included the NAHB housing index, which showed homebuilder sentiment rose 2 points. The SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB) rose about 1 percent, led higher by Toll Brothers, which was up about 3 percent. Investors will also await for the Fed to release the minutes from its July meeting, although Schwab's Frederick said that he doesn't expect any big surprises from them. On the earnings front, several firms, including Home Depot, Lowe's and Cisco Systems, are scheduled to report results this week. "Through Friday's close, 459 companies, or 92%, of S&P 500 have reported 2Q 2016 results," said Nick Raich, CEO at The Earnings Scout, in a Monday note. "While 71% of those companies are exceeding their 2Q 2016 EPS estimates, 60% have had their 3Q 2016 EPS estimate go lower, on average by -1.79%, after releasing results." Last week, retail giant Macy's posted better-than-expected results. U.S. Treasurys fell on Monday, with the two-year note yield holding near 0.72 percent and the benchmark 10-year yields trading at 1.55 percent. The dollar traded lower against a basket of currencies, with the euro near $1.119 and the yen around 101.2. The pound also hit a one-month low against the greenback. Overseas, European stocks traded mostly flat. Asian equities traded mixed, as Japan's Nikkei 225 fell after its GDP data disappointed, while China's Shanghai composite rose more than 2 percent on stimulus hopes. About two stocks advanced for every decliner at the New York Stock Exchange, with an exchange volume of 422 million and a composite volume of 2.096 billion. Gold futures for December delivery settled $4.30 to $1,347.50 per ounce.

"Not to make a statement on which candidate is better, but usually markets prefer for the incumbent party to retain the White House." The three indexes also posted new intraday highs, as benchmark S&P 500 and the Nasdaq composite broke above previous intraday highs of 2,188.45 and 5,238.54, respectively, shortly after the open. The Dow Jones industrial average also posted a record high, rising past its previous high of 18,638.34. These previous records were all set last week, despite the indexes posting just slight weekly gains. "It's a major vacation time between now and Labor day," said Ernie Cecilia, CIO at Bryn Mawr Trust. "The market right now is floating up on not a lot of news." "There's a lack of alternatives into other instruments," he said, noting that trading volume has been low recently. The S&P closed about 0.3 percent higher, with materials leading. Twenty-nine S&P components hit new 52-week highs, including Sysco — which reported quarterly results before the bell, Ross Stores and Procter & Gamble. "The market is being driven by the same theme," said Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at Baird, referring to low interest rates around the world and the "hunt for yield." "Until we get some optimism, the path of least resistance is higher. Nobody likes this market." Spencer Platt | Getty Images The Dow rose nearly 60 points, with Boeing and Goldman Sachs contributing the most gains. The Nasdaq outperformed, advancing nearly 0.6 percent. "The market should continue to go higher on the no-alternative factor," said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial. "The market is feeding on itself." "In order to get a big move down, ... you need to see some news the market perceives as bad," said Randy Frederick, managing director of trading and derivatives at Charles Schwab. "We don't have that right now." Despite posting several milestones last week, stocks traded in a relatively narrow range. The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), widely considered the best gauge of fear in the market, traded near multi-year lows last week. On Monday, it rose 2.25 percent to 11.81. Investors, meanwhile, were watching oil prices as U.S. crude settled 2.81 percent higher at $45.74 a barrel in choppy trade. On Monday, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak bolstered hopes that oil producing nations could take action to stabilize prices, telling a Saudi newspaper that his country was consulting with Saudi Arabia and other producers to achieve market stability. "Good luck with that, if investors believe this. The move which we are seeing in the market is the real example how speculations can drive the price action. If you look at the demand equation, we had GDP data from the third biggest economy in the world and it is not something which is praising the demand for oil," said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets. On the data front, the Empire State Manufacturing survey index fell five points to -4.2. "The lack of even a whiff of volatility, however, prevents me from shifting my outlook from neutral to something more far more negative. The intraday range for the blue chip index has consistently fallen to 0.25-0.50% of the underlying index level. When this statistic falls into this tight band, the blue chips have secured a positive daily return 67.7% of the time since October 2001 compared to 54.5% for all sessions over the same period," Jeremy Klein, chief market strategist at FBN Securities, said in a Monday note to clients. Other data released Monday included the NAHB housing index, which showed homebuilder sentiment rose 2 points. The SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB) rose about 1 percent, led higher by Toll Brothers, which was up about 3 percent. Investors will also await for the Fed to release the minutes from its July meeting, although Schwab's Frederick said that he doesn't expect any big surprises from them. On the earnings front, several firms, including Home Depot, Lowe's and Cisco Systems, are scheduled to report results this week. "Through Friday's close, 459 companies, or 92%, of S&P 500 have reported 2Q 2016 results," said Nick Raich, CEO at The Earnings Scout, in a Monday note. "While 71% of those companies are exceeding their 2Q 2016 EPS estimates, 60% have had their 3Q 2016 EPS estimate go lower, on average by -1.79%, after releasing results." Last week, retail giant Macy's posted better-than-expected results. U.S. Treasurys fell on Monday, with the two-year note yield holding near 0.72 percent and the benchmark 10-year yields trading at 1.55 percent. The dollar traded lower against a basket of currencies, with the euro near $1.119 and the yen around 101.2. The pound also hit a one-month low against the greenback. Overseas, European stocks traded mostly flat. Asian equities traded mixed, as Japan's Nikkei 225 fell after its GDP data disappointed, while China's Shanghai composite rose more than 2 percent on stimulus hopes.

But then after that it’s just kind of like go, go, go again,” said Simone Biles, who won Team USA’s first-ever Olympic vault gold medal on Sunday in Rio. Simone Biles Reveals Her Celebrity Crush, Favorite Food Take Olympic Trivia Quiz to See How Much You Know About the Games Her fellow team member Madison Kocian took the silver medal in the uneven bars event, while teammate Gabby Douglas placed 7th. Kocian, Douglas, Biles and teammates Aly Raisman and Laurie Hernandez sat down with ABC News' Amy Robach in Rio, where they discussed the pressure to excel. “We all have nerves, but at this point it’s kind of autopilot,” Biles said. “We’ve done these routines so many times that once we go out there ... it’s just one more.” Hernandez agreed. “We’re just going to go to training, do what we’ve been doing, not change a thing because that’s working really well,” she said. The “Final Five” have already won gold in the team all-around event, and Biles took a separate gold in the individual all-around competition. “We were very confident once we went out there,” Biles said of her team’s win. “If we had done the same thing in training then we were very confident of the outcome.” The team members had an emotional reunion with their parents at the P&G Family Home -- where Olympic families come to relax and watch the games, have a meal, drop off their laundry and even get pampered with free salon services for women and hot shaves for men. It was the women's first chance to show off their new hardware, hug their families and regroup. The gymnasts say it’s their incredible sisterhood that keeps them laughing as they enter the home stretch of the games. “We’ve been together so long,” Kocian said. Their time together – and their bond – helps their performance. “We’re just so ready that’s it’s fun when we go out there. We don’t need to think about anything. And so that’s how we have fun,” Biles said. Robach also asked the team members a lightning round of questions: Q: Celebrity you most want to meet now that you’re famous? Hernandez: Tori Kelly Kocian: Carrie Underwood. Biles: Zac Efron Raisman: Blake Lively. (Raisman and Hernandez both want to go shopping with Lively.) Q: First food you’re going to eat when you get back. Biles, Douglas, Raisman and Hernandez: Pizza. Hernandez and Kocian: Ice cream. Q: What shows will you binge watch when you get home? Raisman: “Modern Family.” Q: Who's the prankster? Raisman: Laurie's the goofiest one. Douglas: Yeah, she is. Hernandez: Maybe Q: Who's the party animal? Biles: (Points at herself) Douglas and Kocian: Simone. Raisman: Yeah, Simone. Q: Who sleeps the most? Biles and Douglas: Aly. Kocian: For sure, Aly. Raisman: Everyone knew that. Q: If you had to compete in another Olympics event, what would it be? Raisman: Soccer, hockey, figure skating. Hernandez: Track. Biles: Track. Kocian: I don't know, swimming seems cool. Douglas: Javelin. Q: Who has a hidden talent? Biles: (Looking at Hernandez) she can do like crazy things with her mouth. Kocian: Her face just works in so many ways. 0 Shares Email Star Comments " Olympics 2016: ‘Final Five’ Talk ‘Nerves,’ ‘Fun’ of Competition " 'Allied' Review: Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard's Thriller Is 'Nearly Perfect' " Erykah Badu on Music, Family and the Soul Train Music Awards " Corey Feldman Marries Girlfriend Courtney Anne " Video Shows Justin Bieber Allegedly Punching Fan in the Face " Tommy Hilfiger: 'Any Designer Should Be Proud' to Dress Melania Trump " Billy Bob Thornton Opens Up About Humble Childhood " Mariah Carey Breaks Silence on Reported Split With James Packer " Shannen Doherty Teases Photo From 'Heathers' Reboot " Laurie Hernandez Had 'Same Joy' Winning Mirror Ball as She Did Olympic Medals " Spend Thanksgiving Night With OneRepublic, Kelly Clarkson and More " Trump Walks Fine Ethical Line to White House, Experts Say " Wayne State Police Officer in 'Very Grave' Condition After Shooting " Facebook Built 'Censorship Tool' as Part of Chinese Expansion Effort: Report " Thanksgiving Travel Rush: What to Expect Today " Man Injured in Philly Explosion Thought Package Contained Meds: Authorities " Trump's 100-Day Agenda: Experts Examine if It Can Be Done " What Trump Said During Wide-Ranging Interview " Trump 'Seriously Considering' Ben Carson for HUD " Trump 'Leaning' Against Renewed Probe of Clinton, Sources Say " House Republican Criticizes Trump Over Business Conflicts of Interest " Jared Kushner Defends Steve Bannon in Interview, Calls Him an 'Incredible Zionist' " A Look at Gen.

The Roundtable for Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) in April withdrew IOI's 'sustainability certification' after allegations the company had illegally chopped down rainforests in Indonesia and planted palm crops on peatland. But earlier this month, it said IOI, one of the world's leading palm producers and traders, had satisfied conditions for the suspension to be lifted, a move that has sparked sharp criticism from environmental groups. Palm oil, used in everything from chocolate to cosmetics, has become one of the world's fastest expanding crops, but the industry has been facing intense pressure over deforestation and methods used to clear land. That has driven many buyers to demand certification of environmentally sound behaviour. Food companies Nestle, Kellogg, Mars Inc and Hersheys, along with healthcare product makers Johnson & Johnson and Reckitt Benckiser told Reuters they had no immediate plans to return to business with IOI despite the latest step by RSPO. Procter and Gamble told Reuters it had ended its relationship with IOI, while Unilever said it was looking into the watchdog's decision. "(We will not change our approach until) we see IOI's upgraded policies enacted, with improvements verified on the ground by an independent group of experts," Nestle said in an emailed statement. IOI officials in Kuala Lumpur said the company remained committed to "engagement with all its stakeholders" and would be "working hard to re-engage with them in the coming weeks and months". "Our focus will now be on the implementation of our commitments, and progress reports detailing delivery against them will be made public on a quarterly basis," said Surina Ismail, its group head of sustainability. Meanwhile, major palm oil trader Cargill Ltd said it was sticking to its decision to suspend business with IOI. Rita Aspen, regional director of corporate affairs for Asia Pacific, said the company would "review IOI's sustainability policy ... before taking further action". Environmental groups such as Greenpeace called RSPO's decision to lift IOI's suspension premature and counter-productive, and urged companies to put on hold buying from IOI. RSPO, a body of consumers, green groups and plantation firms, said its decision to lift the suspension was recommended by its independent complaints panel, and that it stood by "the integrity of the panel" and its conclusions. IOI is one of the RSPO's founding members. "It sends the message that the RSPO is more concerned about helping a founding member regain its customers than ensuring its standards are upheld," said Greenpeace Indonesia forest campaigner Annisa Rahmawati. Around 90 percent of the world's palm oil crop grows in Malaysia and Indonesia. RSPO previously said the suspension would be reinstated if IOI fails to follow through on an action plan to correct environmental shortfalls.

Procter and Gamble told Reuters it had ended its relationship with IOI, while Unilever said it was looking into the watchdog’s decision. “(We will not change our approach until) we see IOI’s upgraded policies enacted, with improvements verified on the ground by an independent group of experts,” Nestle said in an emailed statement. IOI officials in Kuala Lumpur said the company remained committed to “engagement with all its stakeholders” and would be “working hard to re-engage with them in the coming weeks and months”. “Our focus will now be on the implementation of our commitments, and progress reports detailing delivery against them will be made public on a quarterly basis,” said Surina Ismail, its group head of sustainability. Meanwhile, major palm oil trader Cargill Ltd said it was sticking to its decision to suspend business with IOI. Rita Aspen, regional director of corporate affairs for Asia Pacific, said the company would “review IOI’s sustainability policy ... before taking further action”. Environmental groups such as Greenpeace called RSPO’s decision to lift IOI’s suspension premature and counter-productive, and urged companies to put on hold buying from IOI. RSPO, a body of consumers, green groups and plantation firms, said its decision to lift the suspension was recommended by its independent complaints panel, and that it stood by “the integrity of the panel” and its conclusions. IOI is one of the RSPO’s founding members. “It sends the message that the RSPO is more concerned about helping a founding member regain its customers than ensuring its standards are upheld,” said Greenpeace Indonesia forest campaigner Annisa Rahmawati. Around 90 per cent of the world’s palm oil crop grows in Malaysia and Indonesia. RSPO previously said the suspension would be reinstated if IOI fails to follow through on an action plan to correct environmental shortfalls. — Reuters                  MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Chinese-made US$100b city in Johor 'scares the hell out of everybody' Lufthansa pilots’ strike wreaks havoc on flight schedule Australia’s Crown Resorts casino staff arrested in China Healthcare stocks drag Wall Street lower UK’s Hammond sets target for cyclically-adjusted budget deficit Chinese-made US$100b city in Johor 'scares the hell out of everybody' Foreign banks shaken by Malaysia's move to halt currency slide Malaysia’s central bank says will no longer tolerate ringgit trade in NDF market Ex-Valeant executive, ex-pharmacy CEO charged for fraud scheme Bank Negara Malaysia says it is intervening in currency market Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: China goes global as Trump puts America first Reuters Video: Facebook crafts censorship tool to re-enter China, says NYT Reuters Video: Antigua PM gives Prince Harry awkward honeymoon invite MMOTV: Mahathir, Siti Hasmah head to KLCC by car MMOTV: Red Shirts heckle yellow-shirted Bersih participants MMOTV: A Red Shirts supporter hurls abuse at Bersih supporters Related Articles Palm oil celebrates centennial, output doubles every 10 years Palm oil’s green body comes under fire from activists No ‘slash and burn’ in palm oil industry, says Najib Greenpeace block Malaysian palm oil company IOI at Rotterdam Port IOI Group says made ‘scapegoat’ as green standards ramp up Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2016 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services
Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Monday, 15 August 2016 | MYT 12:19 PM Palm oil buyers hold off mending ties with IOI Corp KUALA LUMPUR: Leading global buyers of palm oil are holding off on mending business ties with Malaysian plantation giant IOI Group despite an industry watchdog's decision to reinstate the producer's green certification. The Roundtable for Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) in April withdrew IOI's 'sustainability certification' after allegations the company had illegally chopped down rainforests in Indonesia and planted palm crops on peatland. But earlier this month, it said IOI, one of the world's leading palm producers and traders, had satisfied conditions for the suspension to be lifted, a move that has sparked sharp criticism from environmental groups. Palm oil, used in everything from chocolate to cosmetics, has become one of the world's fastest expanding crops, but the industry has been facing intense pressure over deforestation and methods used to clear land. That has driven many buyers to demand certification of environmentally sound behaviour. Food companies Nestle, Kellogg, Mars Inc and Hersheys, along with healthcare product makers Johnson & Johnson and Reckitt Benckiser told Reuters they had no immediate plans to return to business with IOI despite the latest step by RSPO. Procter and Gamble told Reuters it had ended its relationship with IOI, while Unilever said it was looking into the watchdog's decision. "(We will not change our approach until) we see IOI's upgraded policies enacted, with improvements verified on the ground by an independent group of experts," Nestle said in an emailed statement. IOI officials in Kuala Lumpur said the company remained committed to "engagement with all its stakeholders" and would be "working hard to re-engage with them in the coming weeks and months". "Our focus will now be on the implementation of our commitments, and progress reports detailing delivery against them will be made public on a quarterly basis," said Surina Ismail, its group head of sustainability. Meanwhile, major palm oil trader Cargill Ltd said it was sticking to its decision to suspend business with IOI. Rita Aspen, regional director of corporate affairs for Asia Pacific, said the company would "review IOI's sustainability policy ... before taking further action". Environmental groups such as Greenpeace called RSPO's decision to lift IOI's suspension premature and counter-productive, and urged companies to put on hold buying from IOI. RSPO, a body of consumers, green groups and plantation firms, said its decision to lift the suspension was recommended by its independent complaints panel, and that it stood by "the integrity of the panel" and its conclusions.

Around 90 percent of the world's palm oil crop grows in Malaysia and Indonesia.

Energy companies rose with the price of oil, but stocks have been locked in an up-and-down pattern for more than a week. As the dollar weakened, the price of oil rose for the fourth day in a row to sustain a recent recovery and metals prices also rose. The Labor Department said inflation remains low, as prices paid by consumers were unchanged in July. Most stocks were down, but for the second day in a row, the biggest losses went to traditionally safe investments like telecom and utility companies. Bond prices also inched lower. The dollar has been very strong over the last few years compared to other currencies. Early this year it looked like the dollar would stay at those elevated levels because the Federal Reserve was raising interest rates while other global central banks were cutting them to stimulate their economies. John Cannally, chief economic strategist for LPL Financial, said the Fed has changed course. By leaving interest rates where they are, it has allowed the currency to weaken a bit, aiding U.S. manufacturing and energy companies and other exporters. “The Fed is using the dollar as sort of a tool of monetary policy,” he said. “The Fed wants to give China and emerging markets time to heal and get their houses in order.” The Dow Jones industrial average lost 84.03 points, or 0.5 percent, to 18,552.02. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index slid 12 points, or 0.5 percent, to 2,178.15. The Nasdaq composite fell 34.90 points, or 0.7 percent, to 5,227.11. Stocks have been setting records recently, but it’s been more than a week since they rose for two days in a row. The market hasn’t made many big moves over the last month. The Labor Department said prices paid by consumers were unchanged in July as gas and other energy prices kept inflation down. Core inflation, which leaves out food and fuel prices, inched up just 0.1 percent for the month. Overall, inflation is up just 0.8 percent over the last year. That’s far below the 2-percent target set by the Federal Reserve, and investors concluded that means the Fed is less likely to raise interest rates soon. The dollar fell to 100.25 yen from 101.25 yen. The euro rose to $1.1277 from $1.1183. The weakening dollar boosted energy and metals prices Tuesday. Benchmark U.S. crude added 84 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $46.58 per barrel in New York. Brent crude, a benchmark used to price international oils, rose 88 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $49.23 a barrel in London. Oil prices climbed last week after steep losses in June and July. That aided companies like pipeline operator Kinder Morgan, which rose 48 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $21.78. Apache Corp. added $1.09, or 2.2 percent, to $50.97. Metals prices also rose. Gold gained $9.40 to $1,456.90 an ounce. Silver added 3 cents to $19.87 an ounce. Copper edged up 2 cents to $2.17 a pound. Bond prices dipped and the yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 1.58 percent from 1.56 percent. Stocks have wavered lately as investors review mixed reports about the U.S. economy as they try to get a sense of its health. On Tuesday the Federal Reserve said U.S. factories cranked out more autos, machinery and chemicals in July, which suggests manufacturers might be recovering, though growth remains little changed from a year ago and manufacturers aren’t adding many jobs. Meanwhile the Commerce Department said the pace of home construction grew by the most since February. Tea maker Hain Celestial Group delayed its quarterly report because of accounting issues and said it doesn’t expect to reach its financial projections for the year. The stock tumbled $14.05, or 26.3 percent, to $39.35. Uniform maker Cintas said it will buy G&K Services, a uniform and facility services maker, for $97.50 a share, or $1.93 billion. G&K Services advanced $14.57, or 17.7 percent, to $96.70 and Cintas stock gained $5.57, or 5.2 percent, to $112.99. Beauty products maker Coty posted results that surpassed expectations, but said little about its purchase of Procter & Gamble’s beauty business, a $15 billion deal expected to close in the next few months. Coty said it’s “premature” to comment on how the combined business will do. The stock skidded $1.47, or 4.9 percent, to $28.28. TJX, the parent of T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and other stores, traded lower after saying higher wages and the strong dollar will hurt its results in the third quarter. Its stock gave up $4.80, or 5.8 percent, to $77.97. Dick’s Sporting Goods announced better-than-expected quarterly results and raised its projections for the year. Its stock jumped $3.87, or 6.1 percent, to $58.76. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline rose 2 cents to $1.42 a gallon. Heating oil picked up 1 cent to $1.46 a gallon. Natural gas gained 3 cents to $2.62 per 1,000 cubic feet. The CAC 40 in France shed 0.8 percent and Britain’s FTSE 100 lost 0.7 percent. Germany’s DAX fell 0.6 percent. Japan’s Nikkei 225 slid 1.6 percent as the yen gained against the U.S. dollar. South Korea’s Kospi took a 0.1-percent loss and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index was down 0.1 percent.

Energy companies rose with the price of oil, but stocks have been locked in an up-and-down pattern for more than a week. As the dollar weakened, the price of oil rose for the fourth day in a row to sustain a recent recovery and metals prices also rose. The Labor Department said inflation remains low, as prices paid by consumers were unchanged in July. Most stocks were down, but for the second day in a row, the biggest losses went to traditionally safe investments like telecom and utility companies. Bond prices also inched lower. The dollar has been very strong over the last few years compared to other currencies. Early this year it looked like the dollar would stay at those elevated levels because the Federal Reserve was raising interest rates while other global central banks were cutting them to stimulate their economies. John Cannally, chief economic strategist for LPL Financial, said the Fed has changed course. By leaving interest rates where they are, it has allowed the currency to weaken a bit, aiding U.S. manufacturing and energy companies and other exporters. "The Fed is using the dollar as sort of a tool of monetary policy," he said. "The Fed wants to give China and emerging markets time to heal and get their houses in order." The Dow Jones industrial average lost 84.03 points, or 0.5 percent, to 18,552.02. The Standard & Poor's 500 index slid 12 points, or 0.5 percent, to 2,178.15. The Nasdaq composite fell 34.90 points, or 0.7 percent, to 5,227.11. Stocks have been setting records recently, but it's been more than a week since they rose for two days in a row. The market hasn't made many big moves over the last month. The Labor Department said prices paid by consumers were unchanged in July as gas and other energy prices kept inflation down. Core inflation, which leaves out food and fuel prices, inched up just 0.1 percent for the month. Overall, inflation is up just 0.8 percent over the last year. That's far below the 2-percent target set by the Federal Reserve, and investors concluded that means the Fed is less likely to raise interest rates soon. The dollar fell to 100.25 yen from 101.25 yen. The euro rose to $1.1277 from $1.1183. The weakening dollar boosted energy and metals prices Tuesday. Benchmark U.S. crude added 84 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $46.58 per barrel in New York. Brent crude, a benchmark used to price international oils, rose 88 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $49.23 a barrel in London. Oil prices climbed last week after steep losses in June and July. That aided companies like pipeline operator Kinder Morgan, which rose 48 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $21.78. Apache Corp. added $1.09, or 2.2 percent, to $50.97. Metals prices also rose. Gold gained $9.40 to $1,456.90 an ounce. Silver added 3 cents to $19.87 an ounce. Copper edged up 2 cents to $2.17 a pound. Bond prices dipped and the yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 1.58 percent from 1.56 percent. Stocks have wavered lately as investors review mixed reports about the U.S. economy as they try to get a sense of its health. On Tuesday the Federal Reserve said U.S. factories cranked out more autos, machinery and chemicals in July, which suggests manufacturers might be recovering, though growth remains little changed from a year ago and manufacturers aren't adding many jobs. Meanwhile the Commerce Department said the pace of home construction grew by the most since February. Tea maker Hain Celestial Group delayed its quarterly report because of accounting issues and said it doesn't expect to reach its financial projections for the year. The stock tumbled $14.05, or 26.3 percent, to $39.35. Uniform maker Cintas said it will buy G&K Services, a uniform and facility services maker, for $97.50 a share, or $1.93 billion. G&K Services advanced $14.57, or 17.7 percent, to $96.70 and Cintas stock gained $5.57, or 5.2 percent, to $112.99. Beauty products maker Coty posted results that surpassed expectations, but said little about its purchase of Procter & Gamble's beauty business, a $15 billion deal expected to close in the next few months. Coty said it's "premature" to comment on how the combined business will do. The stock skidded $1.47, or 4.9 percent, to $28.28. TJX, the parent of T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and other stores, traded lower after saying higher wages and the strong dollar will hurt its results in the third quarter. Its stock gave up $4.80, or 5.8 percent, to $77.97. Dick's Sporting Goods announced better-than-expected quarterly results and raised its projections for the year. Its stock jumped $3.87, or 6.1 percent, to $58.76.

 US stocks fall after mixed reports, with utilities skidding Joe Mcdonald, Associated Press Aug. 17, 2016, 12:00 AM 12 facebook linkedin twitter email print FILE - In this Friday, Nov. 13, 2015, file photo, the American flag flies above the Wall Street entrance to the New York Stock Exchange. U.S. stocks slipped early Tuesday, Aug. 16, 2016, as investors continued to sell phone company and utility stocks. Materials companies are the exception, as they’re trading higher as the dollar weakens. Investors are also sifting through reports that showed inflation remained weak in July, but home building and factory production improved. (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File) syndication.ap.org BEIJING (AP) — Asian stock markets were mostly higher Wednesday after Wall Street declined. Shares in China were mixed after leaders approved a plan to give foreign investors more access to Chinese equities through Hong Kong. KEEPING SCORE: Hong Kong's Hang Seng gained 0.5 percent to 23,016.18 points and Tokyo's Nikkei 225 advanced 0.5 percent to 16,679.89. Seoul's Kospi added 0.9 percent to 2,017.94 and Sydney's S&P-ASX 200 rose 0.4 percent to 5,492.40. The Shanghai Composite Index shed 0.1 percent to 3,105.12. Benchmarks in New Zealand and Malaysia advanced while Taiwan and Singapore declined. WALL STREET SLIDE: U.S. stocks slid as investors sold phone company and utility shares. Stocks have wavered lately as investors review mixed reports about the U.S. economy, trying to get a sense of its health. On Tuesday, the Federal Reserve said U.S. factories cranked out more autos, machinery and chemicals in July, which suggests manufacturers might be recovering, though growth is little changed from a year ago. The Commerce Department said the pace of home construction grew by the most since February. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 84.03 points, or 0.5 percent, to 18,552.02. The Standard & Poor's 500 index slid 12 points, or 0.5 percent, to 2,178.15. The Nasdaq composite fell 34.90 points, or 0.7 percent, to 5,227.11. HONG KONG STOCK LINK: China's Cabinet announced approval of an initiative that would give foreign investors more access to Chinese stocks by linking exchanges in Hong Kong and the mainland city of Shenzhen. Hong Kong is Chinese territory but its financial system is open to foreign investors while mainland markets are sealed off from global capital flows. The Chinese premier said the move will help to reinforce Hong Kong's status as a financial center, and it helped to boost sentiment there on Wednesday. But analysts said the influx of foreign money into Chinese stocks is likely to be modest. A similar measure to link Hong Kong with the Shanghai stock exchange took effect in 2014. Shares in Shenzhen were higher on Wednesday. FED WATCH: Investors looked ahead to Wednesday's release of notes from the U.S. Federal Reserve's July meeting for insight into the debate among board members over when to raise rates. One member of the policy-making board, William Dudley, said earlier it was premature to rule out further tightening this year and another member, Dennis Lockhart, said Tuesday there could be two hikes in 2016. The Fed's earlier decision to hold off raising rates has weakened the dollar, helping exporters. CURRENCY: The dollar gained to 100.57 yen from Tuesday's 100.33 yen.

BY KEVIN GARCIA THE BROWNSVILLE HERALD Emergency workers are urging people to celebrate the New Year responsibly, having seen many holiday-related accidents over the years. Brownsville Police Department Sgt. Kirk Massey said that during his 10 years on the force, excess drinking during celebrations have caused many of the problems he has been called in to handle. He said calling a taxi or getting a designated driver could greatly decrease the chances of an accident. If people are going to go out and celebrate, and they are, they should at least have a designated driver or be prepared to stay where they are at, Massey said. If someone shows signs of intoxication, do not let them drive, Massey said, noting that slurred speech or weakened coordination are strong indicators not to drive. If they cant speak correctly and they cant keep their own balance, then they are not going to have any coordination behind the wheel at all, Massey said. Take the keys. Lt. Jorge Lerma of the Brownsville Fire Department said that the number of traffic accidents emergency workers respond to increases during holidays. He added that during his time as a firefighter, he has seen many victims of drunk driving. In 13 years (with the department) you see a lot of stuff and a lot of times you cant really pinpoint a particular accident, Lerma said. Anytime there is a death, it is usually a pretty gruesome scene. He said such scenes have led many to ease up on their own drinking, including some firefighters. If you have a tendency to drink and drive it really makes you think twice, Lerma said. Theres a number of firefighters that either ease up on their drinking or are a lot more responsible Massey added that driving isnt the only danger that intoxication presents to drinkers. Usually alcohol is going to impair a person, not only the way they drive, but also the way they behave, he said. If you are with somebody that is drunk, and there is going to be an argument, just walk away. Massey encourages calling the police as soon as possible. He explained that the polices role is to calm people down, not make arrests, unless the officers see potential for violence. Discuss Print Posted in Community on Sunday, December 29, 2002 12:00 am.

Shares in China were mixed after leaders approved a plan to give foreign investors more access to Chinese equities through Hong Kong. KEEPING SCORE: Hong Kong's Hang Seng gained 0.5 percent to 23,016.18 points and Tokyo's Nikkei 225 advanced 0.5 percent to 16,679.89. Seoul's Kospi added 0.9 percent to 2,017.94 and Sydney's S&P-ASX 200 rose 0.4 percent to 5,492.40. The Shanghai Composite Index shed 0.1 percent to 3,105.12. Benchmarks in New Zealand and Malaysia advanced while Taiwan and Singapore declined. WALL STREET SLIDE: U.S. stocks slid as investors sold phone company and utility shares. Stocks have wavered lately as investors review mixed reports about the U.S. economy, trying to get a sense of its health. On Tuesday, the Federal Reserve said U.S. factories cranked out more autos, machinery and chemicals in July, which suggests manufacturers might be recovering, though growth is little changed from a year ago. The Commerce Department said the pace of home construction grew by the most since February. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 84.03 points, or 0.5 percent, to 18,552.02. The Standard & Poor's 500 index slid 12 points, or 0.5 percent, to 2,178.15. The Nasdaq composite fell 34.90 points, or 0.7 percent, to 5,227.11. HONG KONG STOCK LINK: China's Cabinet announced approval of an initiative that would give foreign investors more access to Chinese stocks by linking exchanges in Hong Kong and the mainland city of Shenzhen. Hong Kong is Chinese territory but its financial system is open to foreign investors while mainland markets are sealed off from global capital flows. The Chinese premier said the move will help to reinforce Hong Kong's status as a financial center, and it helped to boost sentiment there on Wednesday. But analysts said the influx of foreign money into Chinese stocks is likely to be modest. A similar measure to link Hong Kong with the Shanghai stock exchange took effect in 2014. Shares in Shenzhen were higher on Wednesday. FED WATCH: Investors looked ahead to Wednesday's release of notes from the U.S. Federal Reserve's July meeting for insight into the debate among board members over when to raise rates. One member of the policy-making board, William Dudley, said earlier it was premature to rule out further tightening this year and another member, Dennis Lockhart, said Tuesday there could be two hikes in 2016. The Fed's earlier decision to hold off raising rates has weakened the dollar, helping exporters. CURRENCY: The dollar gained to 100.57 yen from Tuesday's 100.33 yen. The euro edged down to $1.1274 from $1.1276. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude shed 22 cents to $46.35 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract rose 84 cents on Tuesday to $46.58. Brent crude, used to price international oils, tumbled 34 cents to $48.89 in London. It added 88 cents the previous session to $49.23 per barrel.

U.S. stocks slipped early Tuesday, Aug. 16, 2016, as investors continued to sell phone company and utility stocks. Materials companies are the exception, as they’re trading higher as the dollar weakens. Investors are also sifting through reports that showed inflation remained weak in July, but home building and factory production improved. (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File) NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks are slipping Tuesday as investors continue to sell phone company and utility stocks. Materials companies are the exception, as they’re trading higher as the dollar weakens. Investors are also sifting through reports that showed inflation remained weak in July, but home building and factory production improved. KEEPING SCORE: The Dow Jones industrial average lost 48 points, or 0.3 percent, to 18,587 as of 11:40 a.m. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index slid 8 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,182. The Nasdaq composite fell 25 points, or 0.5 percent, to 5,237. CONSUMER PRICES: The Labor Department said prices paid by consumers were unchanged in July as gas and other energy prices kept inflation down. Core inflation, which leaves out food and fuel prices, inched up just 0.1 percent for the month. Overall, inflation is up just 0.8 percent over the last year. That’s far below the 2-percent target set by the Federal Reserve, and investors concluded that means the Fed is less likely to raise interest rates soon. Bond prices dipped and the yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 1.58 percent from 1.56 percent. CURRENCIES: Following the price report, the dollar fell to 100.40 yen from 101.25 yen. The euro rose to $1.1275 from $1.1183. The weakening dollar continued to boost materials companies Tuesday, as it could make their products more affordable in markets outside the U.S. Packaging maker WestRock rose 85 cents, or 1.9 percent, to $44.85. Industrial gas company Praxair got a boost following reports it’s in talks with Germany’s Linde about a possible deal. Its stock rose $6.38, or 5.4 percent, to $124.41. OIL: Benchmark U.S. crude added 67 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $46.41 per barrel in New York. Brent crude, a benchmark used to price international oils, rose 61 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $48.96 a barrel in London. STEEP LOSS: Tea maker Hain Celestial Group delayed its quarterly report because of accounting issues and said it doesn’t expect to reach its financial projections for the year. The stock tumbled $15.20, or 28.5 percent, to $38.20. SUIT UP: Uniform maker Cintas said it will buy G&K Services, a uniform and facility services maker, for $97.50 a share, or $1.93 billion. G&K Services advanced $15.01, or 18.3 percent, to $97.14 and Cintas stock gained $8.03, or 7.5 percent, to $115.45. BLEMISH: beauty products maker Coty posted results that surpassed expectations, but said little about its purchase of Procter & Gamble’s beauty business, a $15 billion deal expected to close in the next few months. Coty said it’s “premature” to comment on how the combined business will do. The stock skidded $1.93, or 6.5 percent, to $27.82. MAXXED OUT: TJX, the parent of T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and other stores, traded lower after it forecast a disappointing third-quarter profit. The retailer said higher wages and the strong dollar will hurt its results. The company had reported solid quarterly results and raised its estimates for the full year. Its stock gave up $3.49, or 4.2 percent, to $79.28. AIG DEAL: Insurer American International Group said it will sell its United Guaranty mortgage insurance unit to Arch Capital for $3.4 billion in cash and stock. AIG has been streamlining its business and said early this year that it would spin off United Guaranty. Its stock picked up 5 cents to $59.27. HOME SWEET HOME: The Commerce Department said the rate of home construction grew 2.1 percent in July, mostly because of an increase in apartment construction. It was the strongest pace of new home starts since February. FACTORY FACTS: The Federal Reserve said U.S. factories cranked out more autos, machinery and chemicals in July. Factory output rose 0.5 percent. Overall industrial production, which includes utilities and mining, grew 0.7 percent as people used more air conditioning in response to hot weather. The results suggest manufacturers might be recovering from a series of challenges that have held them back, including the strong dollar and slower overseas growth. Still, factory output is just 0.2 percent higher than it was a year ago and manufacturers aren’t adding many jobs. GAME ON: Dick’s Sporting Goods announced better-than-expected quarterly results and raised its projections for the year. Its stock jumped $4.08, or 7.4 percent, to $58.97. OVERSEAS: Britain’s FTSE 100 fell 0.4 percent and the CAC 40 in France shed 0.5 percent. Germany’s DAX fell 0.4 percent. Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 1.6 percent as the yen gained against the U.S. dollar. South Korea’s Kospi eked out a 0.1 percent loss and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index was down 0.1 percent.     Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

It’s one more step towards stamping out a pathetic taboo Illustration by Andrzej Krauze Tuesday 16 August 2016 07.56 EDT Last modified on Thursday 25 August 2016 14.29 EDT Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close It’s easier than you think to become an Olympic sensation. You can train for years, sacrifice hugely and perform to your highest ability in front of an audience of billions. But you can also just mention that you’re on your period, and become globally famous. This is what Fu Yuanhui, China’s rather adorable swimmer, did when asked about her team’s fourth place finish in the medley relay. “It’s because my period came yesterday, so I felt particularly tired,” she said. Because she is Fu Yuanhui and rather adorable, she finished the sentence by saying “this isn’t an excuse, I still didn’t swim well enough”. It may not have been an excuse, but it was a disclosure that was revolutionary, because, stupidly, recognising that sportswomen have to perform even with menstrual cramps and while bleeding is still exceptional and newsworthy. UK company to introduce 'period policy' for female staff Read more Fu isn’t the first sportswoman to admit that her uterus shedding its endometrial lining has impacted her job: Heather Watson famously alluded to her period affecting her performance in the Australian Open last year. But she only implied, and the media inferred, that “girl things” meant bleeding. What Fu did was extraordinary. And how pathetic that that’s the case, especially when new research done by Georgie Bruinvels and colleagues at UCL found that 37% of elite athletes suffer heavy menstrual bleeding, about the same proportion as “regular” runners at the 2015 London Marathon, but – despite the impact that anaemia can have on performance – only 22% had sought medical advice. A recent survey by WaterAid found that 56% of women in the UK avoid swimming during their period. Fu Yuanhui’s statement is being called historic. Since most historical records were written or sung by men, we don’t know much about how women managed their menstruation or how they were treated in the past. Probably, as the historian Sara Read has written, they bled into their clothes, much as many rural Indian women still prefer to do (when I asked one woman whether she would wear a sanitary pad, she said, “we don’t even wear underwear. What do you expect? We are jungle people.”). Facebook Twitter Pinterest Fu Yuanhui with her 100m backstroke bronze medal. Photograph: David Gray/Reuters There are hints here and there in history that women’s ability to bleed without injury was seen by male medical professionals as either mystical, marvellous or terrifying. Read cites Lazare Rivière, author of a 17th-century anatomy guide, as saying that the womb was the source of “six hundred miseries and innumerable calamities”. The Roman author Pliny thought menstrual blood was poisonous and could cause “wine to sour, trees and crops to die, mirrors to cloud, swords to blunt, and dogs to go mad should they chance to taste it”. I’ve always wanted to blunt a sword and cloud a mirror. As for women who didn’t bleed and were menopausal: they were often locked up. You think your period is just a pain, but given the amount of effort expended by men to keep bleeding women in their place, it’s obviously a superpower. My period may hurt: but not talking about menstruation hurts more | Rose George Read more Daft menstrual taboos persist in certain countries and religions, where menstruating women have amazing power to make pickles go rotten (leading to a delightful Procter & Gamble campaign called Touch the Pickle), pollute temples, make snakes materialise or sour buffalo milk. But we have no grounds to feel superior in our supposedly enlightened societies. How many women and girls ask for time off work for menstrual cramps, or admit that that’s why they are off sick? How many would admit to feeling appalling and weepy because of premenstrual tension? The only situation in which periods are talked about in the workplace – be it an office or an Olympic stadium – is in banter and jokes, and that is not funny. This self-censorship is why women have put up with sanitary products being taxed as luxury items for years. It’s why it takes on average 10 years for women to be diagnosed with endometriosis, a gynaecological condition linked with painful periods, because either women and girls or GPs – or both – think painful periods are normal. (I was prescribed prescription-strength painkillers for years and never thought to question it; nor did a series of GPs.) Menstruation: the last great sporting taboo Read more But things are better now, right? Bodyform’s recent ad Blood, showing women doing sport, fiercely, and bleeding to a soundtrack of thumping electronica, must mean that talking about periods and performance is now acceptable. This girl can, even when she bleeds. Except the only blood they don’t show is the menstrual kind (I’ve no idea why, they refused an interview). All this positive period empowerment, and yet we’re still being shown blue liquids in most period advertising and treating an athlete’s statement of fact as a massive revelation. Athletes, who must know their bodies and abilities intimately, may well be the best women to loudly talk about periods. So Fu deserves her bronze in the 100m backstroke, but I’d give her a gold medal too: not for admitting that she had a period, but for conveying that it was no big deal. And now, women, let’s get over ourselves and follow in her wake.

Home Church & Ministries U.S. World Politics Entertainment living Opinion Michael Phelps' Net Worth After Winning 28th Olympic Medal at Rio 2016: The Legendary Swimmer's Career Earnings & Endorsement Deals By Junrell Calunod Aug 16, 2016 | 2:58 AM After wrapping his Rio 2016 Olympic stint with six medals, American swimmer Michael Phelps has cemented his record as the most decorated athlete in the history of the international sporting event. The legendary swimmer now holds a total of 28 Olympic medals, with 13 gold medals from individual events, and 10 gold medals from team races. After winning his 28th Olympic medal at the Rio games, the net worth of the 31-year-old swimmer is expected to rise with the incentives and endorsement deals that are coming in. Before Rio games, he is already the richest swimmer alive. Phelps' Net Worth Per Money Nation, as of Aug. 10 this year, Phelps' net worth is at $44.3 million. Ninety eight percent of his earnings came from endorsement deals, while the remaining two percent came from swimming competitions. Yes, I want Breaking Christian News Submit According to the website, Phelps' net worth is 65 percent bigger than the net earnings of two-time NBA MVP Stephen Curry and 38 percent bigger than the net income of U.S. presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. It is also 651 times bigger than the net worth of a typical American family. FX News Call projected that Phelps' Under Armour sponsorship deal alone pays him $5 million. He has also signed lucrative endorsements deals with popular brands like Speedo, Louis Vuitton, Visa, Omega watches, HP, Head and Shoulders, Hilton Hotels, Kellog, and Procter & Gamble, among others. Moreover, Celebrity Net Worth has a higher projection on Phelps' net earnings. The website estimated that prior to the Rio 2016 Olympics, the legendary swimmer's net worth has already mounted to $55 million. Most of these earnings came from his lucrative post-Olympics career, where he attracted dozens of sponsors and appeared in various commercials. More Earnings Are Coming The medals earned by Phelps during his fifth Olympic appearance at the Rio games are expected to boost his net worth. Moreover, the legendary swimmer has earned five gold medals and one silver medal. Per Forbes, American athletes who won medals at the Rio games will receive cash incentives from the U.S. government. At the top of that, according to Time, the actual medal has its value. A gold medal, which is made up of some 24-karat gold, sterling silver and copper that costs around $366. Aside from the actual value of Phelps' Olympics medals and the incentives from the government, Phelps is also expected to receive cash rewards from his present endorsement deals. Speedo, his sponsor in the 2008 Olympics, reportedly gave him $1 million bonus after a successful run in the event.

By Evan Clark on August 15, 2016 Share This Article Reddit LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Print Talk Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway trimmed its stake in Wal-Mart by 15 million shares. REX/Shutterstock The Oracle of Omaha seems to be leaning away from Bentonville and toward Cupertino. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. sold off 15 million shares of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. in the second quarter, cutting its stake by 27 percent to 40.2 million shares worth $2.94 billion, according to regulatory filings late Monday. Over the same three months ended June 30, Berkshire boosted its stake in Apple Inc., buying 5.4 million shares, bringing its stake in the iPhone maker to 15.2 million shares worth $1.46 billion. The quirky billionaire is famous for buying and holding onto companies based on a simple premise like Wal-Mart, which buys at scale and drives down prices to sell goods to lower-income consumers. Buffett started accumulating his investment in the discount giant in late 2005 and since the end of that year, the retailer’s stock has gained 56.7 percent (the issue dipped 0.4 percent on Monday). While it’s difficult to draw direct conclusions from the portfolio shifts at Berkshire, in part because Buffett has brought on board other managers to handle some of the investing, the move from a seller of general merchandise to a seller of ultrapopular smartphones would seem to indicate broader general trends, from the rise of mobile to the increasing competition retailers of all stripes from Amazon. Buffett has dipped in and out of the retail and fashion sectors over the years. The investment house holds a 315,400 shares of Procter & Gamble Co., worth about $26.7 million. The company’s also bought and sold stakes in companies such as Nike Inc. and Seritage Growth Properties Inc., a real estate spin-off from Sears Holdings Corp. arranged by Buffett-admirer Edward S. Lampert. Berkshire also bought underwear maker Fruit of the Loom out of bankruptcy in 2002 and continues to run the company. Buffett, who has backed Hillary Clinton for president, has generally been bullish on the economy. Late last year, he noted: “The interesting thing about the economy is you can give almost the same report ever since the fall of 2009. It really has been growing, is growing, at a couple percent a year, which is not bad. People have gotten more optimistic at times. They thought about a double-dip at times, then they thought it was accelerating.” You're missing something! Activate your FREE PREVIEW now.

The FDA Doesn’t Actually Have The Power To Recall Cosmetics That Harm People Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share The FDA Doesn’t Actually Have The Power To Recall Cosmetics That Harm People Image courtesy of Chris Rief August 15, 2016 4:57 pm EST By Laura Northrup@lnorthrup skin deep WEN by Chaz Dean wen beauty products cosmetics fda food and drug administration Last month, the Food and Drug Administration announced that it would be investigating claims from consumers that the “cleansing conditioner” Wen, purportedly developed by celebrity hairstylist Chaz Dean, had caused scalp irritation and even made some users’ hair fall out. The FDA looked into the situation after receiving 127 complaints about the product, but didn’t know that the marketer, Proactiv maker Guthy-Renker, had received more than 21,000 complaints about the product that it wasn’t obligated to report to the FDA. The manufacturers of medicines and medical products must send any adverse event reports they receive on to the FDA, but cosmetics aren’t as tightly regulated. The New York Times explains that a customer could report a serious injury or even a death that may be linked to a cosmetic product, and companies are under no obligation to report it to the government. The FDA does have the power to recall products that are found to either be mislabeled or contaminated. If the product as labeled and intended causes problems for some users, there isn’t anything that the government can do. There have been efforts to change this law in the past, and different types of cosmetic companies have separate lobbying organizations and favor different levels of regulation. Big companies like Estée Lauder, Procter & Gamble, and Johnson & Johnson favor a version that would require companies to pass adverse event reports on to the FDA, and would also give the FDA the power to recall products that are harmful. Smaller companies, led by Mary Kay, prefer a version that includes the adverse event reporting, but does not empower the FDA to recall products that have been proven to harm consumers. It happens that the less strict bill’s sponsor is Rep. Pete Sessions, whose district in Texas is near the headquarters of Mary Kay, and who has received campaign contributions from Mary Kay employees and other industry executives.

"William Shakespeare has 99% positive global recognition, and by creating The International Shakespeare Project, we are providing brand partners – large and small - a cultural, entertainment and educational icon without equal," said Citron. The Shakespeare "brand" includes a collection of iconic characters and plays that have entertained millions of people all over the world. This is an incredible legacy that will inspire a generation of new productions, including a Broadway musical based on the true life story of Shakespeare and his family, already in development. Shakespeare continues to draw the attention of the largest advertisers in the world. Just this week, P&G launched a major Shakespeare campaign as part of their Olympic sponsorship. The International Shakespeare Project has already selected Think Shakespeare as its first educational program reaching students from 8 to 18. The Shakespeare Channel, launching later this year, will be the first mobile network streaming content in Augmented Reality reaching 14 countries About The Actors Hall of Fame The Actors Hall of Fame Foundation is a nonprofit 501 (c) 3 organization based in Culver City which honors lifetime achievement by actors in Film, Television and Theater.

But then after that it’s just kind of like go, go, go again,” said Simone Biles, who won Team USA’s first-ever Olympic vault gold medal on Sunday in Rio. Her fellow team member Madison Kocian took the silver medal in the uneven bars event, while teammate Gabby Douglas placed seventh. Kocian, Douglas, Biles and teammates Aly Raisman and Laurie Hernandez sat down with ABC News’ Amy Robach in Rio, where they discussed the pressure to excel. “We all have nerves, but at this point it’s kind of autopilot,” Biles said. “We’ve done these routines so many times that once we go out there … it’s just one more.” Hernandez agreed. “We’re just going to go to training, do what we’ve been doing, not change a thing because that’s working really well,” she said. The “Final Five” have already won gold in the team all-around event, and Biles took a separate gold in the individual all-around competition. “We were very confident once we went out there,” Biles said of her team’s win. “If we had done the same thing in training then we were very confident of the outcome.” The team members had an emotional reunion with their parents at the P&G Family Home — where Olympic families come to relax and watch the games, have a meal, drop off their laundry and even get pampered with free salon services for women and hot shaves for men. It was the women’s first chance to show off their new hardware, hug their families and regroup. The gymnasts say it’s their incredible sisterhood that keeps them laughing as they enter the home stretch of the games. “We’ve been together so long,” Kocian said. Their time together — and their bond — helps their performance. “We’re just so ready that’s it’s fun when we go out there. We don’t need to think about anything. And so that’s how we have fun,” Biles said. Copyright © 2016, ABC Radio. All rights reserved.

Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock Will Be a Holiday 2016 Gold Mine Facebook Inc Warning: Slower Growth Means Lower FB Target Price Recent Posts: Facebook Inc Insider Stock Sales Pile Up (FB) Muni Bonds Are a Key to Making America Great Again Starbucks Corporation (SBUX) Stock Is a Long-Term Crowd Pleaser View All Posts Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB) collects less than 5% of the $500 billion spent on advertising annually. The social media giant must dominate emotional ads, a segment that made television the world’s dominant marketing force, and the precision type of ads that built Alphabet Inc (GOOG, GOOGL) to achieve the dreams of founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg, according to The Seattle Times. Good at One So far, FB stock has cracked the second half of the equation by following in the footsteps of Google and locking down “direct response” advertising. For instance, if someone has a store in California that sells books, then he/she would want to find people who are in the market for purchasing books. If someone types “books California” into Google, the the store can then pay to show its link. 9 Stocks to Buy That Will Sprint Past Everything Else Direct response ads make up a large portion of online advertising as they make it easy for companies to find people who are looking for exactly what they are selling. Facebook is good at this type of advertising as well because people tell the social networking site who they are and what they like. But is dominating direct response ads (along with Google) enough for the social networking giant? No. FB Stock Needs to Dominate This Lucrative Segment Also On TV commercials, around $200 billion is spent annually, mostly on branded advertising. Brand ads, for instance, include commercials of smiling families traveling by an Audi through a mountain range, the report says. Brand ads make up a large part of advertising apart from the internet. Also they are lucrative. According to analysis from Bloomberg Intelligence, the average price to reach 1,000 people with a prime-time TV ad in 2015 was $50. In comparison, the ad price on Facebook was $5, the report says. FB stock wants these brand ads desperately. The social media giant is like the Super Bowl every night for advertisers and their $500 billion in annual spending, said Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook’s Chief Operating Officer. This could be wrong though, the report says, adding that more than 1.1 billion people use the social network daily, and around 110 million users watch the Super Bowl telecast. Home Depot Inc: Earnings Will Make HD Stock a Market-Beater Procter & Gamble Co (NYSE:PG), the world’s biggest advertiser, told The Wall Street Journal that it found targeting niches like teenage shavers on Facebook generated too narrow an audience for P&G brands, which needs to sell millions of Gillette razors and bottles of Tide. P&G said it would not spend less money on the social media giant, but it and some other big advertisers appear to be falling back towards TV.

Ogg August 15, 2016 9:05 am EST Print Email Tweet Stocks managed to hit a new high in the week of August 12, and the markets were indicated up on Monday morning. Despite the S&P 500 being valued at 18.1 times forward earnings, low interest rates and a lack of choices for return keep driving investors toward stocks. 24/7 Wall St. reviews dozens of analyst research reports each morning of the week. The goal is to find new investing and trading ideas. Some of these analyst reports cover stocks to buy. Other reports feature stocks to sell or avoid. One interesting issue to consider now is that it would really only require the upside from seven of the 30 Dow stocks to get to DJIA 20,000 in 2017. These are the top analyst upgrades, downgrades and initiations seen on Monday morning: Best Buy Co. Inc. (NYSE: BBY) was downgraded to Hold from Buy and the price target was cut to $36 from $39 (versus a $34.87 prior close) at Jefferies. The stock has a 52-week trading range of $25.31 to $39.10 and a consensus analyst price target of $33.14. Dollar General Corp. (NYSE: DG) was downgraded to Hold from Buy and the price target was cut to $96 from $101 (versus a $92.91 close) at Jefferies. The 52-week range is $59.75 to $96.88, and the consensus price target is $99.80. I'm interested in the Newsletter Get Newsletter terms and conditions   Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ: INTU) was maintained as Sector Perform but the price target was raised to $113 from $93 at RBC Capital Markets. The stock has a 52-week range of $79.63 to $116.97 and a consensus price target of $110.47. McDonald’s Corp. (NYSE: MCD) was downgraded to Hold from Buy at Argus. The shares have a 52-week range of $87.50 to $131.96 and a consensus price target of $130.29. Procter & Gamble Co. (NYSE: PG) was raised to Buy from Neutral with a $105 price target (versus an $87.04 close) at B. Riley. The 52-week range is $65.02 to $87.45. The consensus price target is $90.56. Symantec Corp. (NASDAQ: SYMC) was started with a Buy rating and was given a $26 price target (versus a $22.54 close) at Goldman Sachs. The consensus price target is $23.28, and the 52-week range is $16.14 to $22.58. Merrill Lynch is out with Buy ratings on the three major Chinese wireless and telecom stocks. China Telecom Corp. Ltd. (NYSE: CHA), China Mobile Ltd. (NYSE: CHL) and China Unicom (NYSE: CHU) were all reinstated with Buy ratings. China Telecom is actually the firm’s top pick of the three, as its free cash flow yield will double to 9% with an attractive valuation with 32% implied upside. The firm believes that China Unicom’s sharp free cash flow yield turnaround will drive a rerating.  China Mobile was given 24% implied upside with rapid 4G migration and a mobile data traffic boost.

In 1935 Roosevelt (whom he supported) had only been in office for two years and my parents were still in diapers. Huge Hollywood star, razor-sharp pundit, and one of the best things to come from Oklahoma. Here are some of his observations that ring as true today as they did 80-odd years ago: "Things will get better, despite our efforts to improve them." “The short memories of the American voters is what keeps our politicians in office.” "Ten men in our country could buy the whole world and ten million can't buy enough to eat."  One of the best things to ever come from Oklahoma. "You can't say that civilization don't advance, however, for in every war they kill you in a new way." “If pro is the opposite of con, what is the opposite of Congress?” "There are three kinds of men. The ones that learn by readin’. The few who learn by observation. The rest of them have to pee on the electric fence for themselves.” "A fool and his money are soon elected." "An economist's guess is liable to be as good as anybody else's." "Try to live your life so that you wouldn't be afraid to sell the family parrot to the town gossip." "If all politicians fished instead of spoke publicly, we would be at peace with the world." And one that---Zounds!---appears to be much more applicable to the other team this year than ours: "I belong to no organized party. I am a Democrat." Happy Monday.  Cheers and Jeers starts below the fold... [Swoosh!!] RIGHTNOW! [Gong!!] Cheers and Jeers for Monday, August 15, 2016 Note: Over to you, ma'am… x I suppose they also failed to get your sarcasm about building a wall, banning Muslims & insulting Gold Star parents. https://t.co/hvZbausdbZÃ¢ÂÂ Hillary Clinton (@VoteHillary2016) August 12, 2016  - By the Numbers: 12 days ‘til yummytime!!!

JEERS to hot lead and hot tempers.  Meanwhile, in the world of racism and death penises, two weekend shootings will be generating a lot of heat this week.  In Queens, New York, a respected imam and one of his friends were assassinated on Saturday.  And in Milwaukee Wisconsin, volunteers are cleaning up after a weekend of trigger-pulling and aftermath-violence that included a police officer killing a fleeing (armed with a stolen semi-automatic handgun) suspect and other unrelated shootings that left five dead and four wounded.  And depending on who you ask, it's all the fault of---[Pulls ragged piece of paper out of pocket]---the police, the blacks, the whites, the Muslims, the Muslim haters, poverty, laziness, local government, state government, federal government, Hollywood, Fox News, drugs, gun laws that are too lax, gun laws that are too strict, the kids these days, the parents these days, ISIS, Obama, standardized testing and/or this stupid planet.  Good luck sorting it out. CHEERS to VJ Day. Seventy-one years ago, on August 15, 1945, America celebrated the end of the war in the Pacific.  Our youngest W.W. II vets are now 90 or older, so today it's our pleasure to slip a nip 'o scotch in their Ensure with a wink and a "thank you"---that was a war that needed to be fought.  Meanwhile the Afghanistan war that President Barack Obama started in 2001 has dragged on over eleven---eleven!!!---years longer than the Second World War.  Not that we're counting. JEERS to water, water everywhere.  My worst nightmares almost always involve water---water coming through the roof, smashing through the windows, rising from the floor, waves chasing me faster than I can run, cutting off my escape or leaving me stranded. Fuckin' hate it. But considering what's going on in Louisiana (over 7,000 rescues so far…and snakes, so many snakes), I should shut up and quit whining: [Gov. John bel] Edwards officially requested federal assistance in paying for emergency operations and overtime. Pic of a kayaker from Cathy Newman’s post about the flooding in Louisiana. Glad she’s OK! Meanwhile, an untold number of motorists have been stranded almost 24 hours on a string of islands surrounded by deep water crossing Interstate 12. […] About 5,050 people spent last night in shelters, said Marketa Garner Walters, secretary of the state Department of Children and Family Services. But that doesn’t include a number of ad hoc shelters that were opened by churches and other community organizations. See also Cathy Newman’s DKos diary from yesterday---wow.  Here's the United Way web site. Donate if you're so moved. And feel free to shout at clouds this week---they deserve it. JEERS to today's really exciting game show.  It's called Donald Trump or Child Being Potty-Trained?  Today's quote comes from Charles R. Black, Jr.  All you have to do is guess whether he's talking about Donald Trump or a child being potty-trained: “He has three or four good days and then makes another gaffe.  Hopefully, he can have some more good days.” If you said Mr. Black was referring to Donald Trump, you win.  Although we understand if you thought it was the kid---it’s been ages since Trump has been able to go ”one” day without a gaffe. CHEERS to an artery's best worst friend.  On August 15, 1911, obedient and properly submissive American housewives across the country swooned to the sound of Crisco (short for "crystallized cottonseed oil") glopping into their frying pans and mixing bowls as Procter & Gamble brought it to market.  And this month there was a lot of swooning to the best alternative use of Crisco in a generation: x Tonga's beautiful, oily flag bearer won #RioOlympics2016 before it even started: https://t.co/J67B0TZpiE pic.twitter.com/Df3YQgsFcfÃ¢ÂÂ The Daily Beast (@thedailybeast) August 7, 2016  Over a hundred years later, Americans still love it because it lets them enjoy so many sinful foods.  And cardiologists love it because it lets them enjoy so many brand-new Porsches. - Ten years ago in C&J: August 15, 2006 JEERS to "Macaca Republicans."  Led by Senator George Allen of Virginia, they see people who look different from them and---in 2006, mind you---feel comfortable calling them "monkeys" to their face while supporters lauuugh...and lauuugh...and lauuugh.  (Teacherken has a roundup of press coverage here).  I say...today we are all macacas.  Now, whose turn is it to pick the fleas out of Allen's hair? - And just one more… CHEERS to a legend and his legacy.  You never saw actor Kenny Baker in Star Wars or its sequels, but he was a huge part of what made them so special.  Baker's "stage" was inside R2-D2, and the droid wouldn’t have been nearly as endearing without his wiggles and wobbles to bring it to---odd word here, for a robot---life.  Baker was 81 when he died over the weekend, and for Star Wars fans (Hi, my name's Bill) it's a big loss of a little person who always seemed to be having a good time. x Goodbye #KennyBaker A lifelong loyal friend-I loved his optimism & determination He WAS the droid I was looking for! pic.twitter.com/rd94OEYaHiÃ¢ÂÂ Mark Hamill (@HamillHimself) August 13, 2016 R2-D2 was one of the "droids you're looking for" pursued by the Empire in Star Wars because it had the plans to the Death Star.  This December's Rogue One: A Star Wars Story tells the story of how those plans made it inside the droid's memory banks in the first place.  Last week a new trailer dropped for it.  You can watch the two-minute version here, but if you really want to have your socks knocked off, watch the 4½-minute “Super Trailer” compiled by Nick Hedenbeck from all the existing teaser, trailer and sneak-peek convention footage.

Winning the Ingredient of the Year Award in the Healthy Aging category at a trade show in Geneva, has provided Cork seaweed minerals company Marigot with very welcome international recognition. The win, according to Marigot Commercial Manager David O’Leary, is another strong indication that seaweed is now achieving global recognition as a superfood. Marigot, which is based at Carrigaline and has harvesting and production facilities in Castletownbere, has been in existence since the early 1990s, when it was set up by Les Auchincloss, a previous owner of Biocon. READ NEXT Firms lose Luas court appeal A pioneer in the study of the nutritional value of seaweed minerals, the company created two product ranges for use as an ingredient in foodstuffs, one for human consumption and one for animal feeds. The product range for the agri-feed sector, which improves digestion and rumen conditioning in cows, is called Acidbuf, while the food ingredients and supplement industry range is called Aquamin. With these two brands, Marigot now has sales in 40 countries globally and a turnover of in excess of €20m. The biggest success until now has been in selling to agri-feed sector which accounts for 70% of turnover, but Mr O’Leary believes that the growing recognition of the benefits of seaweed will help the company to significantly increase sales of Aquamin in the future. Produced from seaweed harvested in Iceland, Aquamin is used in food products and supplements. Engaged in continuous research and new product development since it was set up, the company has, over the last 10 years, devoted significant resources to conducting scientific research to demonstrate the efficacy of its products. “We have undertaken extensive scientific programmes covering multiple areas of bone, joint and digestive health which are of particular strengths for our products,’’ says Mr O’Leary, adding that Aquamin is proving effective when used in food supplements by people suffering from osteoarthritis and osteopaenia. “We now have proven scientific evidence from multiple trials while Aquamin has been named ingredient of the year in the healthy aging category at the Vitafoods Exhibition in Geneva – a significant European event in the food supplements industry.” The largest markets for Aquamin products include the US and Europe and customers include the likes of Frito Lay (Pepsico), Del Monte and Procter & Gamble. Australia, Europe and South Africa are the largest markets for the animal feed product range. Mr O’Leary says that over the last six to seven years, the company has achieved growth of in excess of 10% per annum. Selling 95% of its products abroad, Marigot won the High Growth Markets Exporters Award for 2015 from the Irish Exporters Association. Sales have been boosted by the launch in recent years of Margot’s first consumer products which are sold directly on a new company website, www.osean74.com. Mr O’Leary says that sales have been going well and that Marigot is working on developing further products which can be sold directly to consumers. The company, which now employs a staff of 30, is anticipating continued growth of in excess of 10% this year. “We expect continued growth in existing markets and also plan to develop new markets. The focus will be on increasing sales in South America, Asia Pacific and the Middle East and North Africa where we see scope for growth”. In 2017 the company will also continue working on product development. It plans to add to the five product lines for the agri-food sector and develop products in new areas in addition to ones for digestive and bone health. In the food and food supplement area, Mr O’Leary says Marigot will aim to take advantage of the increasing recognition of the benefits of seaweed minerals and the fact that there has been a 147% increase in the launch of seaweed flavoured products in the last five years.

helping News provided by American Red Cross Aug 16, 2016, 15:40 ET Share this article WASHINGTON, Aug. 16, 2016 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- American Red Cross disaster workers are helping thousands of Louisiana residents with a safe place to stay and food to eat despite closed roads and continued flooding making it challenging to get relief supplies to where they are needed. "The current flooding in Louisiana is the worst natural disaster to strike the United States since Superstorm Sandy," said Brad Kieserman, vice president, Disaster Services Operations and Logistics for the Red Cross. "The Red Cross is mounting a massive relief operation, which we anticipate will cost at least $30 million and that number may grow as we learn more about the scope and magnitude of the devastation." Monday night more than 8,400 people sought refuge in 36 Red Cross and community shelters in Louisiana. More than 1,000 Red Cross disaster volunteers have been mobilized from all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico to help with the Louisiana relief efforts. The Red Cross is also mobilizing over 60 disaster response vehicles, nearly 40,000 ready-to-eat meals, and dozens of trailers filled with shelter and kitchen supplies. See more about the Red Cross response here. "People in Louisiana urgently need our help now," continued Kieserman. "Please consider making a financial donation to the Red Cross today." HOW TO HELP People in Louisiana are facing a dire situation. Floodwaters still cover neighborhoods. An estimated 25,000 homes are damaged, affecting at least 75,000 people.

People can donate by visiting redcross.org, calling 1-800-RED CROSS or texting the word LAFLOODS to 90999 to make a $10 donation. Donations enable the Red Cross to prepare for, respond to and help people recovery from these disasters.

The site also allows people to update their status on Facebook and Twitter.

Then, he launched his own company, Walker & Company Brands, and released his first product line — the Bevel Shave System. "A lot of folks, when we started, thought that is was a bad idea" says Walker. "Well, they were wrong." Bevel is a shaving system geared towards people of color, an answer to Walker's own frustrating experience with the shaving products available to him. Traditional razors irritated his skin and depilatory creams were equally unpleasant. The products he bought were often consigned to the "ethnic aisle" in stores. "We wanted to ensure that our products have the dignity or were presented with as much dignity as other products within that aisle. And I think we've succeeded in a very very big way." Bevel is now available at Target and earlier this month, Walker & Company Brands released the Bevel Trimmer. "I think Silicon Valley is growing a hell of a lot more amenable to companies like ours because we are proving that there is such a unique need for this thing." Walker's plans for the future are all big. "We want to build something with as much legacy as a Proctor & Gamble, with as much legacy as a Johnson & Johnson and Unilever, and we're not going to stop until we give our all to that."

More than 200 women are involved in a class-action lawsuit with Chaz Dean Inc. and distributor Guthy-Renker over claims that Wen by Chaz Dean Cleansing Conditioner led to hair loss, hair breakage, rash, and balding. The New York Times reports that Guthy-Renker has agreed to a $26.25 million settlement but it’s not yet been approved by a federal judge. If approved, the settlement would repay $25 to anyone who’s purchased a bottle of the cleansing conditioner and up to $20,000 to people who experienced adverse reactions; they can make claims to be reimbursed for treating said reactions as well as for injury awards. Guthy-Renker stands by the product, citing studies that it believes demonstrates that the product does not cause hair loss, and instead characterized the pending settlement as a “business decision.” Last month, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a safety alert for the cleansing conditioner but that’s about all it can do here — it doesn’t have the power to order recalls of cosmetics like it can with pharmaceuticals. Rather, the FDA monitors complaints submitted on its web site and decides whether to investigate. The agency could take action if it found that a product was mislabeled or contaminated. Proposed legislation from Senators Dianne Feinstein and Susan Collins would require cosmetic companies to notify the FDA of “serious adverse” reactions as they happen as well as submit an annual report of all “adverse events” and would give the FDA recall power. The bill would collect fees to study the safety of cosmetics ingredients and has been endorsed by major companies like Estée Lauder, Johnson & Johnson, and Procter & Gamble. Some independent companies like Mary Kay* support an alternative bill that would still require notification of injuries but would not collect money for safety evaluations or allow the FDA to order recalls. This fight will not be settled anytime soon. *This post has been updated to reflect that while Guthy-Renker is a dues-paying member of the Independent Cosmetic Manufacturers and Distributors (ICMAD), which drafted the alternative legislation with Mary Kay, Guthy-Renker does not have a public stance on any proposed legislation relating to the FDA.

Some cities have boomed in the years since the national unemployment rate hit 10 percent in October 2009, while others have limped back to normalcy. A CNBC analysis of the latest per-capita real personal income data from 2009 to 2014, provided by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, reveals which major metros (with minimum populations of 1 million) have led the strongest rebounds above the nationwide average of 7.2 percent. 1. San Jose, Calif. (22%) With an impressive 22 percent growth in real personal income, San Jose tops our list. Income here rose three times more than the national average. The growth may be due in part to the fact that the metro area is home to nearly eight times as many developers as average, and they take in $147,220 per year on average, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. 2. Houston (15.4%) Houston has seen significant income growth over the past several years, but it has also felt the impact of falling oil prices since 2014. Unemployment ticked higher in June to 5.5 percent. "We have had some significant layoffs in the oil and gas industry," said Patrick Jankowski, senior vice president of research at the Greater Houston Partnership. However, Jankowski noted that the uptick in unemployment could be seasonally skewed, and he pointed to management and real estate sectors that continue to grow. 3. Grand Rapids, Mich. (14.7%) The Grand Rapids-Wyoming metro area in Michigan has diversified greatly over the past 20 years, according to Birgit Klohs, CEO of The Right Place, a Western Michigan development corporation. "We have a health-care and life-sciences sector that 20 years ago did not exist," she said. Housing prices are booming, and the unemployment rate came in at only 3.4 percent in June. On top of that, local business confidence levels are running near a 16-year high. 4. San Francisco (14.6%) While the impressive 14.6 percent gain in personal income recorded in the San Francisco-Oakland metro area might have you thinking about a move, it is worth noting that the average resident dedicates nearly 40 percent of expenditures to housing, which is above the national average. 5. Oklahoma City (13.4%) Although Oklahoma City has felt the recent impact of falling oil prices, the energy sector only accounts for 3 percent of the city's employment base, according to Kurt Foreman, executive vice president of the Oklahoma City Chamber of Commerce. He cites General Electric and Boeing's research centers in Oklahoma City as examples of the city's shift to mechanical engineering. 6. Cincinnati (12%) Notable local employers Kroger and Procter & Gamble employ more than 30,000 Cincinnatians, contributing to the metro's low unemployment rate of 4.4 percent. 7. Dallas (11.7%) While the Dallas-Fort Worth metro area just makes the list, the local economy is showing strength beyond the time horizon analyzed here. Of the 12 largest U.S. metro areas monitored by the BEA, Dallas boasts the second-largest percentage gains in total nonfarm payrolls through 2016 — second only to Phoenix.

"This is an extremely chaotic situation right now, with life-threatening flood waters, power outages and road closures complicating relief efforts – as many local volunteers have also been directly affected by the flooding," said Brad Kieserman, vice president, Disaster Services Operations and Logistics for the Red Cross. "This is by far our largest sheltering effort in Louisiana since Hurricane Isaac, and the bulk of this staggering devastation is in areas that typically don't experience flooding. The Red Cross is mobilizing a massive relief effort which could be our largest since Hurricane Sandy." Thousands of people have been forced from their homes with little but the clothes on their backs. Red Cross disaster volunteers are opening shelters, providing meals and comfort. Additional volunteers, relief supplies and emergency response vehicles are moving toward Louisiana now to bolster response efforts. "Our work is just beginning, and we will be on the ground for weeks helping people in Louisiana pick up the pieces," continued Kieserman. "Entire families have lost their homes and everything they own, please join the Red Cross in supporting Louisiana by making a much needed financial donation today." Flooding is expected to continue for several days, and once waters recede it will take some time to fully uncover the extent of the devastation. The Red Cross will be working closely with partners in the days ahead to ensure people receive the help they need as quickly as possible. Flooding is also threatening communities in Mississippi, where Red Cross volunteers provided safe refuge to nearly 70 people Saturday night. HOW TO HELP  To help people affected by the Louisiana Floods, visit redcross.org, call 1-800-RED CROSS or text the word LAFLOODS to 90999 to make a $10 donation. Donations enable the Red Cross to prepare for, respond to and help people recover from these disasters. FLOODING SAFETY INFORMATION  The Red Cross has steps people should follow to remain safe: 1.     Be prepared to evacuate at a moment's notice and heed evacuation orders when given. When a flood or flash flood warning is issued for your area, head for higher ground and stay there. 2.     Stay away from floodwaters. 3.     If you come upon a flooded road while driving, turn around and go another way. If you are caught on a flooded road and waters are rising rapidly around you, get out of the car quickly and move to higher ground. Most cars can be swept away by less than two feet of moving water. 4.     Keep children out of the water. 5.     Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize flood dangers. DOWNLOAD EMERGENCY APP Download the free Red Cross Emergency App to receive emergency alerts and information about what to do in case of flooding and other disasters, as well as locations of shelters. The App also includes emergency first aid information and a Family Safe feature which allows people to instantly see if loved ones are okay. The free Emergency App is available in app stores by searching for the American Red Cross or going to redcross.org/apps.
