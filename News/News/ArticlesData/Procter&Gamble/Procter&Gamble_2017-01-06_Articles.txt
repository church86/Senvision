The WPP shop has been global agency of record on the business for the past several months after W+K and the client parted ways amid a string of consolidations on the P&G side that also included Secret going from Leo Burnett to W+K and BBDO losing the company’s grooming brands to Grey in 2015. As we understand it, Grey has not yet released its first full campaign for the brand but plans to do so at some point this year. Herbal Essences initially went to Wieden without a review in 2013 after more than 6 years with Leo Burnett’s Atelier. Spokespeople for both Grey and Wieden + Kennedy deferred to the client, which provided the following statement: “…the Herbal Essence business was awarded to Grey New York effective July 1st 2016. This decision is consistent with P&G’s broader agency consolidation effort. Wieden + Kennedy remains a close and important P&G partner working on Old Spice, Secret, and Olympics.” Sources claim that the decision was mutual between P&G and W+K, though we also hear that the move was based on Grey’s past work promoting Pantene for more than 20 years. Herbal Essences may remain best known for the “Totally Organic Experience” tagline, which was developed by Linda Kaplan Thaler‘s shop in 1994 and retired 10 years later before Leo Burnett took over the account. It is still a major P&G brand. According to the latest numbers from Kantar Media, the parent company spent approximately $17 million on paid media promoting the shampoo in North America in 2015 and $16.2 million from January to September of last year. Kantar does not provide global spending numbers. In other Grey news, the agency had to part with a small number of additional staffers over the holiday season after AT&T moved its DirecTV business to BBDO; those who were let go will remain on payroll through January. < Previous Article Next Article > Advertisement Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

Here are seven we think deserve a closer look. Jason Hall, Dan Caplinger, Evan Niu, CFA, Neha Chamaria, Daniel Miller, Steve Symington, and Brian Feroldi (TMFVelvetHammer) Jan 6, 2017 at 7:33AM Great dividend stocks are as close to a money tree as you'll find. Image source: Getty Images.  Dividend stocks can make for wonderful investments -- particularly companies with a strong track record of giving shareholders a reasonable payout while still retaining enough cash to invest in growing the business.  We reached out to seven of our top contributors and asked them to discuss a dividend stock that investors should have on their shopping list right now, and they gave us a diverse group including Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Nike (NYSE:NKE), Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), Consolidated Edison (NYSE:ED), Sysco Corporation (NYSE:SYY), Raytheon Company (NYSE:RTN), and Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (NYSE:EPD).  Are you looking to get paid in 2017? Look no further than these stocks. Keep reading to find the ones that are right for you.  A beaten-down market beater Steve Symington (Nike): Shares of Nike are down nearly 20% this year, but that certainly isn't a reflection of the sportswear and shoe juggernaut's latest financial results.  More specifically, Nike shares climbed modestly after the company delivered a strong fiscal second-quarter 2017 report two weeks ago. Revenue climbed a better-than-expected 6.4% year over year (8% at constant currency), to $8.18 billion, driven by an 8% constant-currency increase in NIKE Brand revenue, to $7.7 billion, and a 5% increase from Converse -- a business Nike acquired in 2003 for just $305 million -- to $416 million. Within the former was 5% growth in NIKE Brand footwear, to $4.82 billion, and a 7% increase in apparel revenue, to $2.54 billion -- both solid, but not overwhelmingly impressive results given today's increasingly competitive retail environment.  Nonetheless, Nike remains a financially sound, cash-generating machine bent on returning capital to shareholders. The company ended last quarter with $5.9 billion in cash on its balance sheet, down only $173 million from the same year-ago period despite making hefty investments in infrastructure, repurchasing 56 million shares for $3.1 billion under a four-year, $12 billion repurchase program authorized in November 2015, and increasing its quarterly dividend (for the 15th consecutive year) two months ago by 13%, to $0.18 per share. At today's prices that equates to a solid annual yield of roughly 1.4%. Combine this with Nike's steady supplemental capital returns and top- and bottom-line growth even in the face of currency headwinds and persistent competition, and I think Nike stock is a worthy portfolio candidate for any dividend-seeking investor. The bluest blue chip of them all Brian Feroldi (Johnson & Johnson): When it comes to dividend stocks, I'm a firm believer that investors should favor companies that have stood the test of time. If that sounds like a reasonable strategy to you, then I think you should seriously consider adding Johnson & Johnson to your watchlist. This company's long-term history is nothing short of remarkable. Johnson & Johnson has grown its adjusted profits each year for more than 32 years in a row. Better still, the company has annually increased its dividend -- which currently yields 2.75% -- for 54 consecutive years. That's an amazing streak that spans multiple recessions, which is telling about how strong this company is. Johnson & Johnson has been able to put up those amazing numbers in part because consumers and healthcare professionals alike trust its brand. That strong connection is a big reason that the company holds the No. 1 or No. 2 position in about 70% of the markets in which it competes. While J&J's stock is currently trading near its all-time high, its trailing price-to-earnings ratio is only 20. That's a discounted valuation when compared to the S&P 500 in general, which makes this a great stock to buy today and to add to on any future dips. This defensive dividend just keeps growing Neha Chamaria (Consolidated Edison): If you're looking for good dividend stocks, how about a defensive utility stock that boasts good cash flow and a track record of dividend increases, and has recently pulled back in price? Consolidated Edison stock's 8% drop over the past six months offers income investors an opportunity too good to ignore. As a regulated electric and gas utility that charges decoupled rates, Con Ed knows well in advance how much in revenue it will generate, which is a huge advantage for any business organization. As fixed revenue means pretty stable earnings, Con Ed has been able to reward shareholders richly over the years: It has increased its dividend for 42 straight years now. ED Dividend data by YCharts. That dividend streak is unlikely to break unless people learn to live without electricity and gas. In fact, Con Ed's growth plans stretch well into two decades, reflecting management's foresight and confidence in the business. From modernizing its existing network to investing billions in renewables like solar and wind, Con Ed has its plans in place. These investments should help the company expand its customer base and further bolster its position in the industry, which should translate into rich dividends for investors for years to come. Given the stock's recent drop and a dividend yield of 3.6%, I believe it's time to load up on Con Ed. A safe bet Evan Niu, CFA (Procter & Gamble): Given the fact that I'm a tech analyst, it might be surprising that I'd advocate putting Procter & Gamble on your dividend stock shopping list. But that's actually precisely the point, at least for my personal portfolio. My portfolio tends to be overweighted in tech, since that's primarily what I follow, and the search to balance and diversify my portfolio with a solid non-tech dividend payer led me to put the household name on my own personal shopping list. To be clear, I haven't bought shares yet, but it's definitely one of the candidates. Procter & Gamble really requires no introduction, nor does its plethora of brands that you probably buy every time you go to the store. It's no surprise that P&G is one of the market's favorite dividend stocks, and has consistently paid out for over 125 years. The company is a paragon of implementing a consistent and sustainable dividend policy, including modest but healthy increases every year -- all while maintaining conservative payout ratios that don't put the dividend at risk. Shares yield around 3.2% at current levels, which should please income seekers. It's true that the company has hit a few headwinds in recent years, including a difficult foreign exchange environment that hurt international sales, and it began streamlining operations by getting rid of more than half of its brands a couple of years go, but overall Procter & Gamble is a solid pick. Cybersecurity provides upside for this defense stock Daniel Miller (Raytheon): If your shopping list is anything like mine, it might have changed quite a bit since November. However, one of the stocks high on my list remains -- and, in fact, has become slightly more intriguing since Donald Trump's victory: Raytheon Company. Raytheon is one of five major U.S. defense contractors, with 2015 revenues topping $23 billion and a well-balanced business that generates about 31% of its top line internationally. It operates in five distinct segments, which are also well balanced, with four of those segments generating the vast majority of revenue: Space and Airborne Systems (SAS), Integrated Defense Systems (IDS), Intelligence, Information and Services (IIS), and Missile Systems (MS). Now, while those four business segments generate most of its sales, its fifth segment, a joint venture called Forcepoint, provides cybersecurity solutions to government as well as commercial clients. While it only generated 1% of sales in 2015 and around 3% this year, its cybersecurity business should easily increase its top line in the double digits for the foreseeable future. The need for cybersecurity services isn't going away, and if Raytheon can turn this business segment into a fifth pillar of revenue, this is a company well poised to reward shareholders over the long term. Also, investors can rest assured that Raytheon's recent dividend history has been shareholder-friendly. It has increased its dividend each of the past 12 years, raising it 9.3% in 2016, and also repurchased $1 billion in shares during 2015 alone. Its dividend yield of 2% won't blow investors away, but it's well positioned for the future with strong cash flow, a healthy dividend, and a balanced portfolio of businesses and technologies.  This dividend stock looks tasty Dan Caplinger (Sysco): Everyone has to eat, and among dividend stocks with long histories of growing payouts, Sysco stands out for its track record of success. The company recently announced its 47th consecutive annual dividend increase, making a 6% boost to its quarterly payment to bring its per-share amount to $0.33. That works out to a 2.5% yield, which isn't the highest in the market, but it's still a healthy payout in a market in which that yield manages to match what the 10-year Treasury is paying. Sysco has been able to grow both through smart internal initiatives and with targeted strategic acquisitions. The company's purchase of European food distributor Brakes Group early in 2016 has helped Sysco keep its top line rising, and in its most recent quarter, Sysco managed to grow earnings nearly 30% from year-ago levels. Looking forward, things look even better for Sysco. The restaurant industry, which is a major customer for the company, has started to recover, and those who follow the sector see even better times ahead as a wave of consumer confidence emerges that could send more people out to eat. Even though some investors are still disappointed that the company's attempted acquisition of U.S. Foods was blocked by regulators, Sysco has plenty of room to take advantage of a more favorable business environment and to look for ways to raise its dividend even further in 2017 and beyond. A steady pipeline of cash flow Jason Hall (Enterprise Products Partners): The oil and gas industry continues to be a tough place to invest. Yes, a lot of energy stocks did pretty well in 2016, riding a recovery from oil prices in February 2016 that were the lowest we have seen since 2004. But even as a lot of oil stocks were coming back from the brink, dozens of former big dividend payers have cut or even eliminated their payouts completely.  Yet Enterprise Products Partners has largely been able to avoid any concerns about having to cut its distributions -- actually, it has modestly increased payouts over the downturn: EPD Dividend data by YCharts. This is partly due to the nature of its midstream operations, which can be largely immune from oil and gas prices, but it's also a product of excellent management, which has done a solid job of playing defense with investors' capital in every market condition. The result? A nearly 6% yield at recent share prices, and a likelihood of more increases in years to come. If you're an income investor looking for an excellent oil and gas stock, look no further than Enterprise Products Partners.  Brian Feroldi owns shares of Nike.

Lose weight. Let’s move beyond these tired resolutions. Globe reporters unearthed true tales of transformation and the catalysts may surprise you HAYDEN MAYNARD FOR THE GLOBE AND MAIL The Globe and Mail Last updated: Saturday, Jan. 07, 2017 3:54PM EST Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Comments Alicia Raimundo, a 27-year-old Toronto mental-health advocate and speaker who suffers from Asperger’s and anxiety, discovered that Pokemon Go was a godsend, motivating her to get her outside, talk to strangers and explore her city – all while reaching her exercise goals. I was first diagnosed with anxiety and depression after I tried to take my own life at the age of 13. I have intermittently seen therapists and counsellors, which led to a diagnosis of Asperger’s when I was in university. I am lucky to be relatively high functioning but I think people always knew that something was a little bit different with me – the difficulty understanding social cues and the inability to relate to or connect with other people in a meaningful way. Asperger’s affects my brain in a way that I didn’t intuitively pick up how to do this like a lot of other people did. That led to a lot of isolation and trouble maintaining friendships. I will go to pretty extreme lengths to avoid social interaction: I don’t go out all that often if I don’t have to. That Pokemon Go might benefit me was an afterthought – I just really like Pokemon. It gave me a good excuse to go outside and do something that wasn’t high pressure. Instead of going outside with lofty goals of talking to people or running 5K, I would go outside to catch a Pokemon that was nearby. I didn’t feel as much anxiety when I was getting dressed to go. It got me moving again: If you walked two or five or 10 kilometres, you would hatch eggs and get new Pokemon, and that was fun. I reached my calorie goals, my standing goals and my exercise goals. I find myself able to walk and run for longer distances. I feel healthier and better. What really affected me about this, though, was that everyone was being really passionate about something at the same time. I didn’t have to worry about being weird or seeming too “into” something: everyone around me was just as into this thing. Everybody was being fundamentally weird together. As told to Zosia Bielski Volunteering becomes a lifesaver Getty Images/iStockphoto Carl Wiese, 64, began volunteering as a meal-delivery driver for Humber Community Seniors’ Services in Toronto nearly 10 years ago. He says it saved his life. After 17 years, my marriage fell apart. That’s when I started getting real health problems. I was so unhappy and depression took over. I was also getting terrible irritable bowel syndrome, diarrhea every day, and aches and pains all over my body. I used to go hiking in the woods, for instance, and I’d walk for 20 miles. Now, I was at the stage where if I went a quarter of a mile, I was so sore and out of breath and tired and aching. Eventually, doctors decided that was fibromyalgia. I had been doing a little bit of volunteering at the Toronto Wildlife Centre, but it was becoming difficult for me to get there. From my home, it was two buses and a long walk. And I just couldn’t walk any more. I remembered my mom used to get Meals on Wheels whenever I went out of town on business. As a driving instructor, I would travel right across Canada for companies like DuPont, Kodak, Procter & Gamble and Hewlett-Packard. One day, coming home from the wildlife centre, I saw a sign on the window at Humber Community Seniors’ Services: Meals on Wheels drivers needed. And I thought, “Gee, my mom used to love that so much, I should go and try it.” Before I started volunteering at Humber, I had reached a point where I didn’t want to take my own life or anything, but I just wished I could just die. I was so unable to do all the things I so loved doing. The day I went in, everything started to change. I do believe it saved my life. Two amazing things happened. The first was the emotional support. The staff there were so supportive. And going to each house delivering the meals, I started to realize, “Wow, I’m not in as bad shape as I thought I was.” These people were inspiring me because they’re fighting their battles and doing so much to keep themselves alive. So I started thinking, “I’ve got to look after myself better.” One of the most important things was seeing the meals I was delivering and going, “Gee, that’s not how I eat.” McDonald’s, Harvey’s, Wendy’s was a typical dinner, especially once I became single again. So I started eating the same foods Humber serves, and boy, oh boy, each year, I got a little better and a little better. I ate more fruits, more vegetables. Now I never buy processed food, I buy fresh only. And now I’m in pretty good shape. I still have a bit of trouble walking distances or carrying anything, but it’s much better than I used to be. In the beginning, I was only able to volunteer one or two days a week. Now I go nearly every single day. I love doing the meals and if I can’t make it, I miss it. Mostly, it’s just the people. Meeting people, talking to people. You know, when they open their door and say, “Hi Carl, how have you been? I’ve missed you.” That makes you feel good. It makes you forget about your tummy ache and your headache. As told to Wency Leung Antidote via entrepreneurship Getty Images/iStockphoto Lindsay Brock, 31, of Peterborough, Ont., has anorexia nervosa. Her health has also been complicated by a recent diabetes diagnosis. Opening her own coffee shop, Amusé Coffee Co. in Peterborough, has helped her tackle her social anxiety and has motivated her to keep her condition in check. I’ve been told before “you’re resisting treatment, you’re not co-operating.” But you wouldn’t tell someone with cancer whose radiation isn’t working, “you’re just not co-operating with your treatment.” The reality is it’s the disorder that’s resistant. Eating disorders are very resistant to treatment. And the current models of treatment, from what I could tell from my own experience, are not effective. I was in the hospital for about six weeks. After I left, I still couldn’t go back to work and my medical state got worse. But I had only ever been a worker and I thrive in busy work environment, especially in management roles. I’ve always wanted to own my own business. On a whim, I found a used espresso machine. The price was really reasonable, and for whatever reason, I just took some money out of my savings and bought it. It’s a commercial machine and it sat in my kitchen for months. I didn’t know what I was going to do with it, it was just too big. But I started crunching some numbers together and put a solid business plan together. I started attending local networking events and small business workshops. That was in January, 2015. And by July 1, I had keys to a space. I had no idea that would happen. I just had to jump at every opportunity, and the more that happened, the more doors opened. It was all very motivating to try to keep myself well enough to work. If nothing else, opening my own business gives me a really positive outlook. I don’t have a lot of traction yet in the way of sales. But it’s rewarding in a lot of other ways. Eighty per cent of our business right now comes from regulars and we have a really amazing following. I’ve also built a really positive rapport with our business community here. It’s a little business family almost. So the social anxiety I was having during all the time I was off work and having trouble getting back out in the world, there’s been a huge improvement. Being my own boss and making all the rules, including menu items and everything, it’s restored some confidence. I’m hoping as that grows, the confidence will follow suit in other areas and will allow me to take better care of myself. I do all the baking for the shop. With my health condition, it does create some tension. But part of why I put myself in the position to bake is I do find it kind of therapeutic. Baking made me more comfortable to be around food and less phobic. It seems a little bit dark or morbid that I’m making all this food, but denying myself of having any. But it’s actually quite calming. There’s a mindfulness to baking. There’s accuracy in numbers and measuring, and an element of control. You have to be fairly rigid about ingredients. So it allows me to get out of my head a little bit. It keeps me in the moment because I have to be focused on what I’m doing as opposed to feeling preoccupied with what I’m feeling in my body. As told to Wency Leung Giving her body a break Getty Images/iStockphoto As an athletic teenager with a double-D chest, Cassie Rodriguez of Vancouver suffered from severe back pain until she had breast reduction surgery at age 20. Years later, her breasts returned to their original size after she went off the pill and had two children. But Rodriguez, now 32, says she would have the surgery again in a heartbeat. When I was 11, I was a 36C. That’s already a pretty tough time for a girl – all of the changes that you’re going through. Then there was the self-consciousness of having old men stare at you. I hated it. By the time I was in high school, I was a 36DD. I’m not a stick but I probably had a 27-inch waist. It was all in the chest. I was really athletic and into volleyball and things like that. I started to get major back pain probably when I was 14 or 15. It felt like really bad tightness and burning between my shoulder blades. I was going for regular massage appointments, trying to get the pain under control. I talked to my family doctor and it was definitely not tricky to get the surgery approved for coverage under the [B.C.] Medical Services Plan. But I still had to go into the specialist’s office and have before pictures done, and he had to do measurements on my clavicle and things like that. We talked about how big he thought I should be versus how big I thought I should be – we didn’t see eye to eye on that. He seemed to want me to be closer to a C, but I wanted to be a small B. I went along with what he said, and ended up a C. I think they removed about 8.5 pounds. I was definitely happy to have the majority of the weight gone. After the surgery, it was the worst car ride of my life getting home over all of the bumps in the road. But the recovery was easy, maybe two weeks. I was still a little hunched over because I had been that way for so long. Massage therapy helped loosen up the muscles so I could stand up better. After about three weeks, I started to feel relief in my back. Running felt much better. And my confidence really went up because I felt like my breasts weren’t the first thing people were seeing about me. Now I have back pain again. Around 2010, my breasts grew back. Sometimes that happens. I don’t know if it was a hormonal change or what – I did go off the birth control pill around that time. I don’t know yet if I’m done having kids, but unless my breasts go way down after I’m done nursing, I would like to have another reduction for sure. As told to Adriana Barton Meditation forges a makeover Getty Images/iStockphoto Michael Satok Wolman, a 59-year-old Toronto artist, was addicted to painkillers for more than three decades and suffers from fibromyalgia and multiple sclerosis. Practising mindfulness meditation has given him not only a way of dealing with his addiction but a whole new perspective as well. You’re craving all the time to get rid of the pain that’s always present and never satiated. I relate it to the myth of Sisyphus. It’s the stone of addiction. It’s like rolling it uphill every day trying to say, “I don’t want to be overcome by this. I want to free myself,” and every day the stone comes rolling back. I was introduced to a program at Toronto General Hospital to help people with chronic pain find alternatives to opiates. I just knew I could not keep willing the stone up the hill every single day and not feel crushed when it rolled back down. I had had enough. I had been on some form of opiate for 30 years. I thought, this has got to stop. I was absolutely chained to the clock. Every day I would be watching the clock to know when I could take my next round. I was put on a medication called Suboxone. The program also teaches mindfulness meditation. I didn’t think I’d be a good candidate for it. I thought the idea of mindfulness meditation where you’re in the present and you’re breathing and you’re focusing on things other than your problems wasn’t something I was going to respond to. But I found that it was an opportunity to focus in a certain way. I try to do it at least once a day for about 15 minutes. I can have that good moment and then be able to refer to it throughout the day. It calms the nerves. It’s given me an opportunity to change the way I thought about my pain. Taking so many painkillers all the time was for me a solution and this was different. This was me recognizing the most important thing that I’ve learned, and that is that I will never be pain-free. There will always be something that will hurt me. How am I prepared to live with it? I have to do it differently. My ability to focus on my art has increased a hundredfold. Mindfulness has given me the chance to engage more with my life. As told to Dave McGinn These interviews have been edited and condensed.

Dan Caplinger (TMFGalagan) Jan 6, 2017 at 7:41AM Dividend stocks offer current income and growth potential, and the dividend stocks that you'll find among the 30 stocks of the Dow Jones Industrials (DJINDICES:^DJI) are some of the best-known, highest-quality dividend payers you'll find. Rather than simply buying the entire Dow, however, many dividend investors choose instead to follow a strategy called the Dogs of the Dow. These stocks offer better yields than the Dow as a whole, and often, they've been able to outperform the Dow over the course of the year. Let's take a first look at 2017's Dogs of the Dow to see what you should watch out for over the coming year. The 2017 Dogs of the Dow Stock Dividend Yield Verizon 4.3% Pfizer 3.9% Chevron 3.7% Boeing (NYSE:BA) 3.7% Cisco Systems 3.4% Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) 3.4% IBM 3.4% ExxonMobil 3.3% Caterpillar 3.3% Merck 3.2% Data source: DogsoftheDow.com. 2 new Dogs for 2017 Because of the way that the Dogs of the Dow get picked every year, you can count on seeing some turnover among the 10 stocks that make the cut. However, 2017 is a remarkably stable year for the Dogs, with just two new entrants joining eight carryover picks from 2016. Leaving the Dogs this year are Wal-Mart and Procter & Gamble. Interestingly, neither of the two consumer giants had particularly good years, with both stocks underperforming the broader Dow in 2016. However, a combination of factors resulted in their falling to the No. 11 and 12 spots on the Dow yield list. First, the addition of Coca-Cola came from even worse performance from the beverage giant than its consumer goods peers. Coca-Cola saw its share price fall more than 3% during 2016, as ongoing challenges related to its long-struggling carbonated beverage segment continued to weigh on its prospects. The threat of greater regulation and taxation in some areas has hit Coca-Cola, and efforts to find efficiency gains haven't been adequate to give investors the optimism in the company's future prospects to justify share-price gains. Moreover, the recent strength in the U.S. dollar could once again create difficulties for Coca-Cola, given how much it relies on foreign currency for its revenue and profits. The much more unusual move in the Dogs came from Boeing, which saw its yield jump not because of a decline in share price but rather from a huge raise that the aerospace giant made late in the year. Boeing boosted its quarterly payout in December by 30%, making its quarterly payout $1.42 per share. That helped send its yield up by more than a full percentage point compared to where it started 2016, despite Boeing's solid share-price increase of 8% for the year. The move shows how much confidence Boeing has in its recent success, despite some concerns among investors that the volume of new orders in the future might begin to slow from its breakneck pace of recent years. Image source: Getty Images. Can the Dogs of the Dow beat the market in 2017? You can't count on the Dogs of the Dow always beating the entire Dow, but it has had a recent string of good outcomes. For 2016, the strategy led to a rise of about 16%, topping the 13% gain in the overall Dow. Moreover, the Dogs paid higher dividends that gave the strategy another percentage point of outperformance compared to the overall Dow. That good result brought the Dogs of the Dow's track record to six wins in seven years. The strategy didn't manage to match the Dow in 2012, and in 2014, it took the added returns from dividends for the Dogs to pull ahead. A small win in 2015 also didn't bring much outperformance, but better performance in 2010, 2011, and 2013 has many investors convinced that the Dogs of the Dow are back for good. Yet when you go back 20 years, the win-loss record is much closer to .500 than investors would like to see. The main reason to follow the Dogs of the Dow is that it's a simple way to get performance that's roughly in line with the Dow. Some years will be winners and others losers, but if you want a conservative dividend strategy that emphasizes blue-chip stocks, it's hard to beat the Dogs of the Dow.

At 12:30 IST, the barometer index, the S&P BSE Sensex, was down 9.68 points or 0.04% at 26,868.56. The Nifty 50 index was currently down 4.10 points or 0.05% at 8,269.70. The Sensex was currently trading below the psychologically important 27,000 mark, after hitting an intraday high above that level in mid-morning trade. The Sensex and the Nifty, both, reversed direction soon after hitting their highest intraday level in almost two months in mid-morning trade.

Grasim has exposure to the cement sector through its holding in UltraTech Cement. Bharti Infratel rose 1.66% to Rs 355.55 on reports a foreign brokerage has upgraded its recommendation on the stock to buy. The brokerage expects stronger tenancy growth for Bharti Infratel. Bharti Airtel's stake sale in the company could be a catalyst, it added. The brokerage has raised its earnings estimates for Bharti Infratel by 2-3% for FY 2018-19. GE Power India rose 1.55% after the company said it has been awarded a contract by NTPC ALSTOM Power Services (a 50:50 joint venture between NTPC & GE) of approximately Rs 198.80 crore including duties and taxes. The order is for steam turbine upgrade project at NTPC's Ramagundam super thermal power plant in Telangana. The company's scope of work consists of supply of steam turbine module, its auxiliaries, turbine controller and spares including supervision of erection, commissioning and testing, GE Power India said. The announcement was made after market hours yesterday, 5 January 2017. Chartered Logistics advanced 1.26% after net profit rose 49.6% to Rs 4.10 crore on 3.2% decline in net sales to Rs 38.20 crore in Q3 December 2016 over Q3 December 2015. The result was announced after market hours yesterday, 5 January 2017. Overseas, most Asian stocks were trading higher today, 6 January 2017. China's Shanghai Composite was down 0.21%. Japan's Nikkei 225 fell 0.34%. In US, the tech-heavy Nasdaq closed at a record yesterday, 5 January 2017, as the broader stock market finished lower, dragged down by a steep slide in the financial sector and major retailers. Mixed data on jobs also raised concerns a day before the closely watched December employment report due today, 6 January 2017. In US, the private sector added 153,000 jobs in December, according to ADP, a rate that was below forecasts, while first-time jobless claims fell 28,000 in the latest week, dropping to a nearly 43-year low. Separately, a reading on the US services sector held steady at a 12-month high in December, suggesting growth in non-manufacturing activity, mainly the service sector, remains strong.

We’ll go beyond natural resources like air and water to look at how efficiency in raw materials can boost the bottom line and help the environment. We’ll also examine the circular economy and design for reuse — with an eye toward honoring those resources we do have. Sponsored by Sealed Air Sustainability at Home and Beyond While changes at home can’t solve the many environmental crises we face today, they can sure help. Through this series, we’ll explore how initiatives like curbside compost pick-up, rebates on compost bins, and efficient appliances can help families reduce their impact without breaking the bank.

With this in mind, every Friday TriplePundit will give you a fun, easy read on a topic you care about. So, take a break from those endless email threads, and spend five minutes catching up on the latest trends in sustainability and business. Each year, the National Park Service manages more than 100 million pounds of waste — and now Subaru will help them do it. With the start of the new year, business leaders around the world are contemplating how to take their companies to the next level when it comes to sustainability. And despite what’s happening in Washington, American businesses are rising the occasion — cutting carbon emissions, conserving water and energy, and engaging employees around their goals. If you’re looking for a bit more inspiration for the new year, consider this: Has your company ever thought about going zero waste? These 10 firms working toward zero waste to landfill prove it’s possible. And no, it won’t kill jobs or hurt profits. 1. Subaru Subaru of Indiana Automotive (SIA), the automaker’s only U.S. manufacturing plant, hasn’t sent waste to local landfills in over 12 years. The same goes for two of Subaru’s manufacturing plants in Japan. Thanks to suggestions from employees, Subaru reuses everything from auto part packaging to staff food scraps. On a net basis, its Indiana plant saves $1 to $2 million per year due to reduction and reuse — and Subaru has the best profit margin in the automotive industry. And the reuse and recycling doesn’t stop at the factory: About 96 percent of the components in a Subaru vehicle can also be recycled or reused. Organizations across the world noticed Subaru’s moves and asked the company how the heck they did it. Subaru agreed to benchmark with several of these organizations, including the National Park Service, to help them accomplish zero waste in their own operations. 2. Sierra Nevada Back in 2013, Sierra Nevada said it saved more than $5 million by diverting nearly 100 percent of its waste from landfills. The U.S. Zero Waste Business Council certified its Chico, California, brewery as a platinum-level Zero Waste Facility the same year. And the company kept those numbers up, diverting 99.8 percent of its solid waste in 2014. To accomplish this feat, the company sends its spent brewing ingredients — at least 150,000 pounds of malted barley and 4,000 pounds of hops a day — to local cattle and dairy farms for use as feed. Its Chico brewery is also home to the first HotRot composting system in the U.S. Since it was installed in 2010, the system has transformed more than 5,000 tons of the company’s organic waste into rich compost which is then used in its Estate hop field, barley field and garden. The company has a similar partnership with a local composting company near its brewery in Mills River, North Carolina. 3. Toyota Subaru isn’t the only automaker making waves in zero waste. In fact, the automotive sector is one of the widest adopters of such policies — and Toyota is a prime example. The company’s North American facilities reduced, reused or recycled 96 percent of their non-regulated waste in 2015 — totaling over 900 million pounds. The automaker became a founding member of the U.S. Zero Waste Building Council two years earlier. It now has 27 North American facilities that meet the council’s definition of a zero-waste site, including 10 manufacturing plants. And the U.S. EPA recognized Toyota Motor North America with a WasteWise Partner of the Year Award last year. 4. Unilever Two years ago this month, Unilever announced that over 240 of its factories achieved the company’s goal of sending zero non-hazardous waste to landfill. By replicating its zero-waste model in other parts of the business, nearly 400 additional sites eliminated waste-to-landfill as of February of last year. Unilever says its journey to zero waste saved the company over $225 million and “created hundreds of jobs.” To help others achieve similar results, Unilever teamed up with value-chain platform 2degrees last year to help bring organizations together around the zero-waste model. “While I am proud of what our employees and partners have achieved across our manufacturing operations and the wider business, there is a lot more to be done to inspire a wide-scale movement,” Pier Luigi Sigismondi, chief supply chain officer for Unilever, said in a statement last year. “It is time to accelerate efforts to move towards a zero-waste world and our new collaboration with 2degrees will allow us to share lessons and experiences, and to encourage other businesses and industries to take up the zero-waste challenge. By building a network of partners and working together, we can eliminate waste on an unprecedented scale across the globe.” 5. Ford Another leader from the automotive sector, Ford Motor Co. is making serious gains toward zero waste. The automaker aimed to reduce waste-to-landfill by 40 percent per vehicle between 2011 and 2016. It blew past this target, achieving a 54 percent reduction by 2015. The company now operates 63 zero-waste-to-landfill facilities around the world, including all of its Mexican and Canadian plants. In 2015 alone, six Ford manufacturing plants and 29 non-manufacturing plants achieved zero-waste-to-landfill status. 6. Fetzer Vineyards Fetzer Vineyards, one of Mendocino County, California’s largest wineries, has been sustainable from the start. It’s the largest wine company in the world to receive B Corp certification and the first winery in California to operate on 100 percent renewable energy. Fetzer, which was purchased by Chilean wine company Viña Concha y Toro in 2014, was also the first winery to publicly report its greenhouse gas emissions with the climate registry, but even that is not enough: The company hopes to be net carbon positive by 2030. Fetzer’s bold sustainability goals include eliminating waste from its supply chain. It was the first wine company in the world to receive zero-waste certification from the U.S. Zero Waste Building Council — and it achieved the council’s highest honor, platinum certification. “This achievement reinforces that companies can work to create a closed loop system that is both profitable and sustainable,” Josh Prigge, sustainability manager at Fetzer Vineyards, said of the milestone in a 2014 statement. And we’re inclined to agree. 7. Procter & Gamble Consumer packaged goods giant Procter & Gamble has a bold goal for 2020: for each of its plants to send zero manufacturing waste to landfill. Reaching this target would divert 95 percent of the waste the company produces — and it’s already well on its way. Today, more than 55 percent of P&G sites are send zero manufacturing waste to landfill. Other waste produced, such as office paper and food scraps, is diverted through employee-led programs. And the company says such staff-led initiatives allowed its Costa Rica plant to go entirely zero-waste-to-landfill. In the future, P&G also hopes to completely eliminate consumer waste stemming from its products through the use of recycling education campaigns and moves to increase the recyclability of its packaging. 8. New Belgium Brewing Is there something about alcohol that makes business leaders want to stop waste in its tracks? If so, pour us another glass. Another leader in the brewing space, New Belgium now diverts 99.9 percent of its waste from landfills. It also achieved platinum certification from the U.S. Zero Waste Business Council. To achieve this feat, the company carried out an exhaustive waste audit of more than 500 waste collection points across its Fort Collins, Colorado, facility. By identifying best management practices and end-of-life scenarios for each material, staffers were able to find a useful application for nearly every bit of waste they produce. “However, there is still more to do!” the company says on its website. “We are constantly looking at ways to close loops and eliminate waste generated in the first place.” 9. Google As part of its portfolio of sustainability targets, Google is looking to cut the waste produced by its data centers down to size. Although Google didn’t set a deadline for when it expects to go fully zero-waste, six of its 14 data centers sent nothing to landfill last year. And 86 percent of the tech giant’s waste is reused or recycled globally. Google’s ‘moonshot’ campaign to cut waste at data centers includes aggressive reuse campaigns to create a second life for data servers. Googlers are also looking for ways to recycle old office furniture and introduce more composting to further reduce waste. 10. Microsoft In November of last year, Microsoft became the first technology company to have a facility awarded zero-waste certification from the U.S. Green Building Council. The company’s headquarters in Redmond, Washington — where more than 44,000 employees work in 125 buildings across 500 acres — now diverts 90 percent of its waste from landfills.

If you'd like to learn more... - A A + Listen A viral Facebook post claims a 2-year-old boy died after his mother applied Vicks VapoRub to his skin, but the manufacturer and authorities in U.S. and Mexico say they have no record of such a death. Posts shared by several websites including smag31.com and naij.com in the past two months reference a Mexican mother who applied the ointment to her sick toddler son’s body, including under his nose in order to help him breathe. The post says he later was found dead due to inflammation of the respiratory tract. The story blames camphor in the ointment for the death. Story continues below READ MORE: Flu season – signs you’re too sick and should stay home The story does not name the mother, the baby or the place of death. Versions of the story have been posted in previous years, with some including a reference to a woman named Elena who works in a tortilla factory. U.S. Food and Drug Administration spokeswoman Andrea Fischer said a search of a database dating back to 1968 reveals no deaths of children using VapoRub. Reporting of adverse reactions to medication by health care professionals or consumers is voluntary, she said. READ MORE: Flu outbreaks, hospitalizations reported across Canada, latest numbers show The office representing Mexico’s health secretary also said it had no record of any death caused by VapoRub. Velvet Gogol Bennett, a spokeswoman for VapoRub-maker Procter & Gamble Co., said the Cincinnati-based company has investigated the story’s claims but it has never received any notification from any local health authority, hospital, doctor or “official news organization anywhere in the world.” READ MORE: Here’s what works and what doesn’t when you’re fighting a cough and cold VapoRub contains low, government-approved doses of camphor. The label advises against VapoRub’s use in children younger than 2 and says the cough-suppressant shouldn’t be applied near the mouth or in the nostrils. P&G also markets a Vicks BabyRub for infants 3 months and up that doesn’t contain camphor. READ MORE: What happens to your body when you get the flu, step by step Camphor use on young children has been a subject of concern for doctors. A 2009 report in the journal Pediatrics described three New York City toddlers who suffered seizures after they had eaten camphor products, inhaled camphor or had it rubbed on them for colds. The products included folk remedies, pesticides and air fresheners. The labeling on VapoRub was supported by findings from a 2009 study by Wake Forest University researchers published in the journal Chest, although it suggested VapoRub could cause respiratory distress in infants and small children. © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.

 The 10 things in advertising you need to know today Hannah Roberts Jan. 6, 2017, 4:58 AM 2,064 facebook linkedin twitter email print Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer. AP Photo Good morning. Here's everything you need to know in the world of advertising today. 1. A fired Snapchat employee claims the company lied to investors ahead of its IPO. Snap Inc., as Snapchat is now called, has denied the allegations, countering that they are "totally made up by a disgruntled former employee." 2. Verizon's still not sure if its $4.8 billion Yahoo deal will close, five months after announcing it. That's according to Verizon's executive VP Marni Walden, who was asked at an investor event on Thursday if the company would proceed with the initial deal. 3. This is how brands are using Twitter's most recent customer service tool "featured tweet," reports Digiday. Brands including Starbucks, Citibank, Hotels.com and Hyatt are curating custom profiles on Twitter. 4. One of Wall Street's most accurate tech analysts, RBC Capital's Mark Mahaney, predicts the 10 biggest surprises for 2017. By "surprises," Mahaney says he defines it as "an event that the average Internet investor thinks is highly improbable, but we believe has a reasonable chance (30%+) of occurring." 5. Here are three reasons Hulu's under-$40-a-month cable TV competitor could be a major hit, according to Nomura Instinet analyst Anthony DiClemente. An attractive price, a lot of content, and industry-leading features. 6. Music streaming service SoundCloud may run out of cash this year as it posted a €51 million ($54 million) loss. The company is now admitting that, should its subscription service flop, its funding may run dry this year. 7. This is how news broadcasters are using Instagram Stories, Digiday reports. Right now, the feature is more about sampling than drawing in viewership to owned platforms. 8. Two of Procter & Gamble Co.'s home care brands will make their debut at this year's Super Bowl, Ad Age reports. Mr. Clean and Febreze will each have 30 second spots. 9. Snapchat's Spectacles "bot" vending machine has been spotted near the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, The Drum reports. Twitter is exploding over it. 10. Media execs shares their progress on January detoxing, Digiday reports. Twitter’s Europe chief, Bruce Daisley said: "For me, life is about sustainable moderation.

Browse the full report at http://www.credenceresearch.com/report/india-and-china-baby-diapers-market Market Insights: India and China represent the largest markets, in terms of consumer base and volume, for different consumer products. The era of using traditional cloth diapers is rapidly exiting, especially in India and China, thereby driving the overall baby diapers market growth. The baby diapers market in countries such as China and India is majorly driven by the strong birth rate in the countries as compared to the rest of the world. Another major factor fueling the market growth is the rising awareness regarding baby care and other health issues. With the increasing discretionary income, people here tend to spend more over baby care products such as diapers, food and formula products. This has led to emergence of large consumer base in the countries thereby driving various global players in the two markets. One of the most significant factors positively influencing the market is the rising urbanization across the two countries. Increasing number of female workforce in the countries has led to rise in need for baby care convenience. Using baby diapers largely becomes convenient for such parents thereby fueling the market growth. As a result, adoption of baby diapers and other baby care products has risen substantially in the countries in the past few years. In terms of adoption rate, India leads the India and China baby diapers market. China, however, is estimated to register high growth during the forecast period with the growing inclination towards convenient baby care products.

Los Angeles, CA 1/5/2017. Photo by John McCoy/Los Angeles Daily News (SCNG) U.S. Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert A. McDonald, who is unlikely to be re-appointed under President Donald Trump, is taking a victory tour of sorts through Los Angeles this week to highlight gains made to improve health care access and wait times for veterans and to rally residents around an ambitious goal to end veteran homelessness. McDonald joined Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti for a stop at Bob Hope Patriotic Hall in downtown L.A. to discuss veteran homelessness, and he announced Operation Reveille, which he described as a “big push” lasting until the end of January to house as many homeless veterans around the country as possible. McDonald said the agency has leaned on Los Angeles to help reduce the national rolls of veterans who live on the streets or have no stable home. The city has the largest population of homeless veterans in the country, even after finding homes for 8,000 of them in recent years, with about 1,200 left to house. “If we don’t make progress in ending veteran homelessness in Los Angeles, we won’t make progress nationally,” McDonald said. He also said he is “proud” that veteran homelessness has been “cut in half since 2010,” when the goal to end homelessness was first set. The secretary joined Garcetti and Los Angeles County Supervisor Mark Ridley-Thomas in signing on to a “recommitment” to the goal of ending veterans homelessness. Garcetti said part of the effort will include calling on landlords in Los Angeles to more freely open their units to homeless veterans who possess vouchers to subsidize their rents. Many homeless Angelenos have reported a difficult time finding a place to live, often waiting 100 to 300 days, he said. Garcetti also asked Angelenos to reach out to the homeless veterans who are living in their neighborhoods and to help connect them to housing. Garcetti said officials in Los Angeles are aiming to get to “functional zero” on the number of homeless veterans, which means there may still be some who are still living on the streets, but that “effectively all the homeless vets that we know will be housed.” To continue maintaining the progress made, Garcetti said that “we will have the infrastructure to quickly house any new veterans who become homeless.” “So this isn’t just about ending the job,” he said. “It’s about keeping the infrastructure so that we never again allow a veteran to stay on the streets very long if we find him or her in Los Angeles.” • RELATED STORY: ELECTION 2016: Los Angeles voters give Prop. HHH green light Los Angeles voters in November approved Proposition HHH, a $1.2 billion bond measure that finances the construction of homeless housing, and the city has committed to providing funding for vouchers and outreach as part of a comprehensive joint plan with the county to tackle homelessness in general.

County to fund programs that pair with the homeless housing. • RELATED STORY: LA County Supervisors place quarter-cent sales tax to help homeless on March ballot The local officials also praised McDonald’s efforts to turn around the troubled veterans agency, which has been blasted for making veterans wait months to see doctors. Under McDonald’s stewardship, the veterans administration has turned to private providers to expand veteran access to health care. McDonald, formerly CEO of Procter & Gamble, was confirmed in 2014 to head the agency after the previous VA chief, Eric Shinseki, stepped down amid revelations of falsified records and excessively long wait times for health care. McDonald said the agency is “transforming” and that it now offers “same-day access to primary care and mental health care in every one of our nearly 150 VA medical centers.” Clinic hours also have expanded, including into the weekends, and more nurses and doctors were hired, he said. The agency’s backlog of disability claims, which numbered more than 600,000 three years ago, is “down ... 90 percent,” he said. McDonald has reportedly not interviewed with Trump for another stint, despite calls by some veterans groups last month to re-appoint him. With the expectation that McDonald may not continue under Trump, local officials took the opportunity to thank him. “As the administration winds down its last days, this is somebody who is a national treasure, who can easily continue this work across administrations,” Garcetti said. “And I would hope that we can continue to learn lessons of his leadership, continue to bring that focus.” “I just want to personally thank him for his friendship and for his attention to Los Angeles,” he said. “He has changed lives – thousands of them – for the better.” Click here to subscribe to Digital & Home Delivery - 50% off About the Author Reach the author at echou@scng.com or follow Elizabeth on Twitter: @reporterliz.

Posts shared by several websites including smag31.com and naij.com in the past two months reference a Mexican mother who applied the ointment to her sick toddler son’s body, including under his nose in order to help him breathe. The post says he later was found dead due to inflammation of the respiratory tract. The story blames camphor in the ointment for the death. The story does not name the mother, the baby or the place of death. Versions of the story have been posted in previous years, with some including a reference to a woman named Elena who works in a tortilla factory. U.S. Food and Drug Administration spokeswoman Andrea Fischer said a search of a database dating back to 1968 reveals no deaths of children using VapoRub. Reporting of adverse reactions to medication by health care professionals or consumers is voluntary, she said. The office representing Mexico’s health secretary also said it had no record of any death caused by VapoRub. Velvet Gogol Bennett, a spokeswoman for VapoRub-maker Procter & Gamble Co., said the Cincinnati-based company has investigated the story’s claims but it has never received any notification from any local health authority, hospital, doctor or “official news organization anywhere in the world.” VapoRub contains low, government-approved doses of camphor. The label advises against VapoRub’s use in children younger than 2 and says the cough-suppressant shouldn’t be applied near the mouth or in the nostrils. P&G also markets a Vicks BabyRub for infants 3 months and up that doesn’t contain camphor. Camphor use on young children has been a subject of concern for doctors. A 2009 report in the journal Pediatrics described three New York City toddlers who suffered seizures after they had eaten camphor products, inhaled camphor or had it rubbed on them for colds. The products included folk remedies, pesticides and air fresheners. The labeling on VapoRub was supported by findings from a 2009 study by Wake Forest University researchers published in the journal Chest, although it suggested VapoRub could cause respiratory distress in infants and small children. ___ Associated Press writer Maria Verza in Mexico City contributed to this story.

Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Are Nestlé’s Raisinet Boxes “Recklessly” Under-Filled? January 6, 2017 11:08 am EST By Ashlee Kieler@akieler where's the candy? Raisinets nestle candy slack fill lawsuit class action lawsuit california deceptive marketing By now most Consumerist readers are familiar with the Grocery Shrink Ray, where the amount of a product in a package shrinks over time to keep the price of the product consistent without decreasing profits. Sure, that’s annoying and perhaps a bit misleading, but the Shrink Ray’s sneakier twin — slack-fill — is even worse, and now it’s the reason for a class-action seeking lawsuit against Nestlé, accusing the candy company of “recklessly” underfilling its Raisinets boxes.  The lawsuit [PDF], filed in a California federal court, claims that Nestlé purposefully deceives customers with its opaque movie-theater-style containers of Raisinets, leading customers to believe they are getting more product than they really are. According to the lawsuit, the boxes — sold at grocery and convenience stores across the state — are uniformly underfilled, with only 60% of the package actually filled with Raisinets candy. The remaining 40% is considered slack-fill — empty space that, as defined by federal law, serves no functional purpose, such as protecting the package’s contents. The lawsuit contends that the extra space found in the Raisinets package is a violation of the law because the candy “isn’t susceptible to cracking, breaking, or crumbling like potato chips in a bag would be.” “The Raisinets candies are also not sticky due to the chocolate being coated with confectioner’s glaze, which protects the candies and makes the candies smooth,” the suit states. “Therefore, any concern for the safety of the contents inside the Products has been or should be alleviated by both the nature of the Raisinets candies.” By packaging the Raisinets in the way it does, the suit claims that Nestlé “recklessly disregarded the fact that the products contained a significant amount of non-functional slack-fill” that would mislead consumers. The woman who filed the lawsuit says she purchased the product at a Ralphs grocery store in California relying on the size and shape of the packaging, believing it was full of candy. “However, the Nestle´ Dark Chocolate Raisinets [she] purchased contained approximately 40% empty space,” the suit states. “She would not have purchased the Product or would have paid significantly less for the Product had she known that the package was only approximately 60% full of Raisinets.” As a result, the suit claims the woman — and others like her — have suffered injury and lost money as a result of Nestlé’s “misleading, false, unfair, and fraudulent practices.” The suit seeks to represent “at least thousands of class members” and to recoup at least $5 million in refunds and any interest accrued from their previous purchases. This isn’t the first time companies have come under fire for non-functional slack-fill. In July 2015, Proctor & Gamble agreed to pay $280,000 and revamp its packaging in order to settle with four California counties that accused the company of using slack-fill in its Olay brand beauty products. That three-year long investigation began when investigators in four counties discovered that for some moisturizers, the size of a product’s box depended not on the actual size of the container, but on the price per ounce. Of course, slack fill isn’t confined to beauty products: a smaller spice-maker sued McCormick in 2015 over containers of pepper that contain less product but have stayed the same size.
