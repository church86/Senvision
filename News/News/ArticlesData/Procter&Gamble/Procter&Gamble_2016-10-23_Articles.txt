P&G reports a $2.7 billion profit, beats forecasts Alexander Coolidge , acoolidge@enquirer.com 4:48 p.m. EDT October 25, 2016 Buy Photo Procter & Gamble's headquarters in downtown Cincinnati. (Photo: The Enquirer/Cara Owsley)Buy Photo Procter & Gamble reported Tuesday a $2.7 billion profit for the three months ended Sept. 30, an increase of 4 percent from a year ago. Sales were flat during the first quarter of the fiscal year, staying at $16.5 billion. Organic sales, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange rates, acquisitions or divestitures, increased a robust 3 percent. Earnings per diluted share were 96 cents. Both core earnings and sales beat Wall Street forecasts, according to Bloomberg. Analysts had expected P&G to report on Tuesday a 98 cents per share in core earnings, which exclude one-time items. The company's core earnings per share was $1.03. P&G's sales also topped $16.5 billion when forecasters expected revenues slightly under. P&G shares rose $2.87 or 3.4 percent to close at $86.97. Last year, the company reported a $2.6 billion profit on sales of $16.5 billion in the same period. Organic sales growth was driven by a 2 percent increase in product volume, while pricing remained flat. Organic sales also surged to 3 percent growth in the U.S. and 2 percent growth in China, the company's two largest markets, according to P&G's chief financial officer Jon Moeller, who spoke with reporters in an early-morning conference call. By comparison, organic sales grew just 1 percent in the U.S. and shrank 8 percent in China from July to December 2015. Foreign exchange shaved 3 percent off total sales. Sales were growing in all top 10 markets, except Great Britain, which is struggling in the wake of the Brexit vote fallout. Analysts mostly cheered strengthing results, though they noted relatively easy year-ago comparisons given P&G's sluggish growth in the past few years. "We believe sales growth is most important, and a 3 percent increase, despite favorable (year-over-year) comparisons, indicates P&G is making solid progress," wrote Stifel analyst Mark Astrachan, in a Tuesday note to investors, pointing out P&G's organic sales were the strongest quarterly gain in more than two years. A skeptical Barclays analyst Lauren Lieberman also noted the increase but said results were aided by slumping sales last year and a lower tax rate and flat costs this year. She noted the strong first quarter sales, didn't prompt P&G to increase its outlook for the fiscal year. "As we see it, investments P&G needs & plans to make in product innovation, marketing, branding (and seemingly pricing) will take time and money to drive sustainably stronger results," Lieberman wrote. P&G reaffirmed its forecast Tuesday that calls for a 2 percent increase in organic sales that will translate into a 1 percent total sales increase after foreign exchange is factored in. The quarter's results come three weeks after P&G completed a split off with nearly a third of its beauty business. The challenge going forward is for P&G to reignite sales growth at its remaining core businesses of Tide detergent, Gillette razors, Pampers diapers and other household staples. CEO David Taylor said the new fiscal year was off to a solid start at P&G. "Our first quarter results mark a good start to the fiscal year, " Taylor said in a statement. "We’re pleased with the progress we’re making, but there is still more work to do." Taylor and other P&G executives have promised Wall Street that a smaller company will be easier to manage. And despite cutting away 14 percent of its sales, Taylor said the brands P&G kept are responsible for 94 percent of the company's profit. P&G has 10 product categories for its remaining 65 brands. The latest results reflect P&G results prior to the divestiture because the transaction closed days after the July-September quarter that is being reported. Analysts' profit forecasts were based on profits split among by 2.8 billion shares outstanding. Nearly 105 million shares were retired in the beauty divestiture in early October. Early this month, P&G finished a two-year process of divesting more than 100 brands with a final,  massive split-off of 41 underperforming beauty labels such as CoverGirl makeup. The latest divestiture transaction merged the beauty brands – doing $4.5 billion in annual business – with New York's Coty Inc., which makes Calvin Klein perfume and Rimmel makeup. Since 2014, Cincinnati-based P&G also completed deals to sell Iams pet food, Duracell batteries and dozens of smaller labels. Also, through a combination of buyouts, layoffs, attrition and brand sales, P&G has cut 34,000 jobs or 26.4 percent of its workforce since it announced a restructuring plan in 2012. Today, the company's payroll is now at roughly 95,000 – its lowest level since 1991. 69 CONNECTTWEET 14 LINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://cin.ci/2eLsg55 TOP VIDEOS Bengals vs. Bills Week 11 predictions 6:02 Cincinnati.com Prep Sports 360 for Nov. 15. 20:46 Supermoon rises over Cincinnati 0:55 Bengals vs. Giants wrap-up 3:15 The day Ray Tensing's murder case was declared a mistrial: 'The world was watching Cincinnati' 3:46 DuBose family reacts to news of mistrial 1:35 Tensing jury submits a question: Define 'arrest' 2:08 DuBose Fiancée still feels 'confident that a murder conviction will come' 0:48 Tensing jury can't agree on verdict, judge orders more deliberation 2:39 Bengals vs. Giants Week 10 Prediction 4:59 Cincinnati.com Prep Sports 360 for Nov. 8 18:29 Jeff Ruby: 'I sense there is not going to be justice' for the DuBose family 2:18 Deters on Tensing crying on the stand: ‘The place to be upset... was after you just blew someone's brains out' 26:55 Defense makes its closing arguments in the Tensing Trial 41:26 Prosecution makes its closing arguments in the Tensing Trial 26:35 Tensing: 'Oh my God, he's going to run me over, he's going to kill me' 12:03 Use-of-force expert: 'The actions of Ray Tensing were justified' 0:50 Which stores are opening, closing Thanksgiving Day 0:34 \u0022I can't wait to see Tensing on the stand\u0022 0:55 Cincinnati Police Criminalist: Tensing 'seemed nervous or afraid' 2:59 Crime lab: No evidence on Tensing’s boots that he was dragged 4:07 Alternate juror in Ray Tensing trial has been dismissed 1:24 Born in Cincinnati, celebrated around the world: An anthem that unites us 3:39 Inside Prep Sports 360: Colerain Football prepares for playoffs 5:05 JP Macura looks ahead to the season 2:24

Asit Sharma (TMFfinosus) Oct 24, 2016 at 12:35PM In this episode of Industry Focus: Consumer Goods, Vincent Shen and senior Fool.com contributor Asit Sharma look at the wide world of SKUs, or stock keeping units. Companies across various industries must strike the right balance between product breadth and operational complexity to succeed, and SKU rationalization (or reduction) lies at the heart of that challenge. The latest initiatives at Unilever (NYSE:UL) and Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) exemplify the efforts companies are taking in this space. A full transcript follows the video. This podcast was recorded on Oct. 12, 2016. Vincent Shen: Welcome to Industry Focus, the podcast that dives into a different sector of the stock market every day. It is Wednesday, Oct. 12th, and I am your host, Vincent Shen. Just so you know we are pre-recording this episode and teeing it up to air on Tuesday, the 18th. I am connected with Fool.com senior [contributor] Asit Sharma via Skype. How are you, Asit? Asit Sharma: I'm doing very well, Vince. Thank you for asking. Doing great this morning! Shen: Yeah, I had Dan on yesterday. He was in South Florida. I know you're in Raleigh, North Carolina, we were able to speak before the show, and I was glad to hear that everything was OK after the hurricane. But two guests on, or two [contributors] on, and both of you guys did see at least a little bit of impact from the storm. Sharma: Yeah, we were a little surprised here in Raleigh because most of the models forecast that the storm would hit more fiercely where Dan was. So I thought maybe Dan would be wet, I would be dry. It did come in inland a little bit. I happened to be traveling actually, so missed that, but the good news is the storm is over and we're cleaning up. So we'll move on. Shen: Yup. So I was really excited to have you on the show today, so we can kind of really pick up from our last discussion and continue breaking down some of the supertrends that we are seeing in the consumer and retail sectors. Last week we talked about mass customization, the growing importance of basically personalizing products and services to appeal to consumers and to build brand loyalty. So we looked at custom sneakers, right? From NIKEiD, how Starbucks can brew the exact coffee you want with their very expensive Clover brewing system, and then there's Etsy, with the huge marketplace it has built for handmade crafted goods. So our next supertrend has companies turning their attention, I think, a bit more into their internal operations. That's with SKU rationalization or specifically for our discussion, SKU reduction. So we'll look at this through the lens of two leading consumer products companies: Unilever and Procter & Gamble. But before we get any further than that I mentioned SKU rationalization and I think some of our listeners could probably use just a quick update or refresher on exactly what we're talking about there. Sharma: Absolutely. What is an SKU? It's shorthand for "stock keeping unit" and Wikipedia has a great definition. I'm going to read this for our listeners. It's a "distinct type of item for sale." So manufacturers identify their products by unique codes that they've built. Those may actually be different than the barcodes that you see in, let's say, a grocery store when you're picking up a package to scan and pay for, but each product a manufacturer builds has this code and every time they vary the product whether it's size, color, anything, that creates a new stock keeping unit, or SKU. Shen: So, I think that with the SKUs and it kind of comes into conflict a little bit. On the one hand, we're going to talk about in this discussion how companies are working to basically make their operations more efficient, more profitable, and in some cases they are able to even boost their sales by reducing some of the offerings that they give to consumers. But in the last episode, we talked about on the customization side, giving more optionality, more potential to personalize and customize a product for each consumer, but I guess my question is can you give us an idea of how things flow through a company? We can use maybe one of the two companies, Unilever, or Procter & Gamble as an example, but how this decision in terms of what products are offered, the number of SKUs in a company's portfolio kind of flow through and can impact some of the metrics that investors are focused on generally. Sharma: It's a good question. Companies play a guessing game when they create products for a particular brand portfolio. And that guessing game is: What will the consumer want? What's the consumer's tolerance for product variation? And there are three major factors that drive the expansion of a product portfolio. First is to keep those product lines fresh and relevant. Most of us have seen the phrase "new and improved," and I guess listeners are are familiar with the concept that this is all in a marketing ploy, but companies also create more products to suit the changing whims of the customer. I have these whims, and you have these whims, we may not know it, a lot of times these are internalized and it's based on what we imbibe from our culture, popular culture. Just also what's practical in our lives. Could be a very small variation on, let's say a handle of a grocery jug. We've seen milk cartons change over time. So, these whims drive product innovation as well. The third thing is product innovation. Now, when I think of product innovation, I think of a brand-new product. Because, well, innovate; you must be creating something new. But corporations look at slight variations in product packaging or say they change a formulation, add a flavor to a juice. If you are a beverage manufacturer that is a third reason. And innovation to a manufacturer can be very slight tweak. So these three factors drive that expansion of a portfolio and what we see is that in the consumer marketplace, companies will first expand their portfolios and then start to draw them back because it's an art, it's not a science. If a company had a handle on exactly how many variations of a product per each geographical region was necessary, then they would find this miraculous optimization of profit. And that's just not something that comes easily. Shen: Yeah, I think it's important to point out that with every item that a company offers essentially, that has costs and investments associated with it. Think the storage of your completed product and the materials needed to create it, packaging, your supplier relationships, the marketing of your offerings, and also disposal in some cases for some products or SKUs that have gone obsolete. So every dollar a company spends toward one SKU that would have been better spent on another, will potentially result in a reduction in the top or bottom line. Or both. So, I think for publicly traded companies, it's fair to say that investors and shareholders place a high value on also the predictability and accurate guidance from management. I think you had mentioned earlier a little bit about forecasts; if you have an overabundance of offerings and SKUs, I think it becomes increasingly difficult to essentially forecast out your expected sales and that can reduce profitability if discounting, for example, is needed to reduce stock or you have to send additional stocks to suppliers because items sold out unexpectedly. And let's jump directly into one of our two companies. Let's start with Unilever. No. 3 consumer goods product company by revenue behind Procter & Gamble, and Nestle. Can you tell us a little bit about their efforts and how they've approached SKU rationalization? Sharma: Sure. So, our supertrend for today is this idea of shrinking SKUs or SKU rationalization and why it's a supertrend and why Unilever is such a great example. We, in our last episode, separated the idea of just a trend from the idea of supertrend by saying if many corporations are out there jumping on this trend and they're both big and small, that is a great indication we're seeing a supertrend. Unilever fits right in because they're one of the biggest, baddest consumer goods companies on the planet. They have hundreds of brands and literally thousands and thousands of SKUs and they practice what Vince has mentioned a couple times: SKU rationalization. Let's quickly define that term if you're not familiar with it. It's a really simple concept. SKU rationalization is when you use data and analytics to pare down those underperforming SKUs and then you transfer your resources into the SKUs which are getting market share. So we're going to use this term a lot and it's a great way to sound really smart if you're talking to other investors; you can talk about SKU rationalization and your favorite companies. Unilever's multiyear goal is to reduce their SKU by 20%. When you visualize a company which is in hundreds of countries around the globe dealing with local markets, you can imagine the complexity of their operation. So for a company like this to decide to reduce SKUs ... Well, let me stop here. Last week we talked about Nike, which I also call Nike, SKUs are often pronounced as "skews," so if you hear me start saying "skews," same thing. But this multiyear goal sprung from management's realization that if we undertake this investment, we may reduce revenue somewhat but we're going to have more profitable products. I'd like to talk about one case study. This is something that happened several years ago when Unilever's U.K. and Irish units combined into one group. When they got together, this was around 2008 to 2009, and they performed an analysis of their SKUs and they found that 60% of product variance contributed just 5% of their sales, but that made up 20% of inventory. And Vince, I know you had also seen that case study. What are your thoughts about that? That really opened my eyes to why a company should jump in and perform SKU rationalization. Shen: Yeah, those numbers -- notably the 5% of sales and the 20% of inventory -- is unbelievable. This case that you mentioned, I think it was from 2008 to 2009, but even as recently as 2014 Unilever still had about 50,000 SKUs in its portfolio. So it's a monumental task. You know, keeping track of that, managing that, and the fact that, as we'll get into more detail, about how the company and specifically the U.K. and Irish units kind of approached this issue. Really, the results you'll see have had a very direct impact on their financial performance. Sharma: Sure. One of the ways that Unilever and other companies benefit once they trim those SKUs is that their manufacturing setups become more profitable. So again, some learning today -- companies have what are called manufacturing lines. That is, when you go into a plant you can imagine that not every product has its own manufacturing line, else we would have factories taking up most of the square footage on Earth. But similar products lines and manufacturing setup is a process of preparing several products to run through lines either individually or ganged up together. So if you can take, to use an example, package of cereal and reduce the sizes of those boxes or the numbers of sizes that you offer, that is, then you can make that one manufacturing setup, which is there to produce those boxes, more profitable. And those of you who are familiar with manufacturing will understand that the company itself may have part of the manufacturing process, but every multinational conglomerate has to work with a series of smaller suppliers and they have their own manufacturing setups to produce one product. So, you can see this trimming of SKUs reducing the complexity of the operation and this is a big thing that industry people talk about. It's not just shrinking or reduction, it's the reduction of complexity and Unilever is really bent on doing that. Shen: Yeah, I think ... Let me just jump in there really quick. The thing that really surprised me is when they talk about this project, the fact that the amount of work that they had to do with their partners. It wasn't just this internal process that the right managers in departments could implement unilaterally. They had to work with their marketing teams that had previously invested resources and time into certain projects, excuse me, and products and SKUs. And then also their retailers, for example, you know the companies that they distribute their products to are concerned about making sure their shelf space is the way they want it to be. And that the products that Unilever is providing them -- you know a huge supplier, I'm sure, for a lot of these retailers -- that basically they can still optimize their shelf space, what they keep in stock, in their stores based on these changes. And some of them very radical that Unilever was making. Sharma: That's an excellent point. We're going to talk about our second company, Procter & Gamble, in a moment, but P&G's CEO recently made that point on an analyst call and he said that when they talk with their retail partners, that's one of the major things that CEOs of their retail partners are telling them is, "Hey, reduce this complexity." And you know, we're in a political season. Elections are coming up next month and one of the things we can extrapolate from what you just said, Vince, is that this can be a really political process. You can imagine if a marketing team has worked two years on an innovation and another management part of the company looks at this product that marketing team has pushed forth and realizes that logistically it's very hard to produce, and you have teams tussling over whether a product stays or goes. And the companies which are successful at SKU rationalization understand that they, at the end of the line, are responsible to shareholders, to earnings per share. So they have to make some tough decisions, and this often means reducing suppliers. I'm going to give you another eye-opening statistic. We talked about Unilever reducing SKU count by as much as 20% as a multiyear goal. The company also wants to reduce the number of its suppliers by 35%. And these two goals are related; it may be a little scary to have a revenue concentration with a huge corporation like Unilever or a smaller sub-manufacturer and understand they are looking, not just to trim the SKUs, but to trim the number of people they work with. But again, this serves shareholders' interests, it reduces complexity, and reducing complexity reduces costs, which boosts net income at the end of the day. Shen: Yup. So in our last few minutes here, I wanted to make sure we got to Procter & Gamble because they have been taking, I think, this whole process and reducing and optimizing their offerings to a whole other level with the amount of brands they have dropped recently and how they're trying to refocus their resources, their money, into basically what they see as the most profitable brand portfolio that they can possibly target. Sharma: Absolutely. If you take the concept of SKU rationalization and blow it up, there's a term for it. It's called brand rationalization. And that's what Procter & Gamble is up to. They also have been talking up their effort to reduce SKU count over the past several years. But a couple of years ago they woke up one day and realized: We have way too many brands in our portfolio. So, over the last 18 months, Procter & Gamble has exited, or consolidated, 61 of their brands and it's in the process of exiting 44 more by the end of this year. Again, going back to what we found in Unilever's case study, the brands that Procter & Gamble is getting rid of represented only 6% of profit during those 18 months. And when this whole process is completed, Procter & Gamble is going to be left with only 65 brands across 10 major categories. Shen: So let me hop in there really quick. One thing I wanted to make sure we touched on for listeners was also just previously, over the summer, we'd done a show that's somewhat related to this, was around inventory turnover, inventory management, and there's a point here, a metric here, for Procter & Gamble that really stands out to kind of show how this brand rationalization that you mentioned has benefited them. So let's touch on that, and then also I'd love if there are any other metrics. I know there's nothing that is one-to-one necessarily with SKU management and with reduction that investors can look at, but what other metrics can investors use when trying to evaluate a company's effort in this space? Sharma: Sure. Well, you've touched on a really great one. This is a metric that you can find on many financial websites, but if you look at days of inventory outstanding. When you hear that a big company is trying to become more efficient with its product lines, there's a way you can see if they're being effective or not. Procter & Gamble before this effort, the other day, had a days inventory outstanding of 78 days. What that means is that it takes Procter & Gamble about 78 days to cycle its inventory on average and it replaces its inventory about 78 days, if you average everything out. Through this process, P&G now has a days inventory outstanding of 58 days, and that's a very solid boost to cash flow because inventory is cash tied up. You have to build a product, you have to move it, you have to store it, to get into a store, and then you get paid and collect the cash. So, this is an excellent metric to see if a company is walking the walk. And we can tell in this case that P&G is certainly walking the walk. Some other metrics you can look at include the cash conversion cycle which again, is maybe effective to look at but might be more difficult to find. But if you want one which is easy enough to locate, look at a company's operating cash flow. Procter & Gamble again is sacrificing some top-line sales in order to trim its brands. That means some brands will disappear, it won't be selling those on the marketplace. But if you look every quarter going forward at the amount of operating cash flow Procter & Gamble generates, if it's being successful, that number is going to grow every quarter here on out. I love to look at that when I know companies are trying to become more efficient with their resources. And these two concepts are tied together. The company cycles its inventory more quickly, it should produce more operating cash flow. And so far what we're seeing is it's a good thing that Procter & Gamble has undertaken this initiative so long-suffering investors have seen that stock for many years just remain stagnant. It's finally, I think, getting a little bit of lift from these operational efforts. Shen: Yeah, absolutely. We are about to wrap up here, so thank you Asit for your thoughts. But I really wanted to hammer the point home in terms of how important these efforts can be for companies by stepping back a little bit and giving a little bit of a big-picture context and calling out some numbers that I think can put things into perspective. For example, in 2008 research from the Food Marketing Institute had the typical U.S. grocery store, or supermarket, stocking about 47,000 different products. That is up 50% from the previous decade and about five-fold since 1975. Keep in mind that a Wal-Mart Supercenter, for example, their SKU numbers for a store that size is well over 100,000. And then if you go a step further, researching the case at any one time in the United States, there are at least one million products on the market for consumers to purchase. So that research might be a few years old now, so with some of the other trends that we've seen you can imagine that number is likely much larger than one million at this point with customization, for example. So the sobering reality I think for a lot of retailers, be it Unilever or Procter & Gamble, is that consumers only use about 340 unique items in a year out of that one million-plus. And making sure that you are maximizing your profitability, maximizing your product mix and what is on store shelves, to boost your revenue and make sure that that small subset of items that each consumer uses includes products from your portfolio, is just really important. Is there any other thoughts that you wanted to leave our listeners with, Asit? Sharma: Just one last thought. And by the way, those are some mind-boggling statistics and I think that really visually gives us an idea of how much supply there is out there of product and why it's a great idea to reduce as much as you can if you're a manufacturer. My last point is that we see the Pareto Principle in life a lot, which is, 80% of outputs are due to 20% of inputs. See that in so many different spheres of life and manufacturers have found this to be very true ... SKU and brand rationalization, that a lot of times it's just a few products that are really driving your sales and your profits, so why wouldn't you put in the effort to pare those down and optimize your profit and optimize your cash flow? As investors, we should be looking for the companies which are actively trying to perform this exercise. And the two companies we've mentioned today are really into this. Their management talks about these concepts almost every conference call, we see it in the numbers, and it's a great way to evaluate a consumer goods company. Are they paying attention to the proliferation of products that they've got, and are they trying to make themselves more efficient as time goes on? Shen: All right. Thank you very much, Asit!

Blame it on the rising U.S. dollar, or fears of higher rates. But chasing yield is now triggering losses. By Michael Kahn Biography Oct. 24, 2016 4:05 p.m. ET Given the near-zero interest-rate environment of the past eight years, it’s hard to blame investors for seeking yield wherever it might be. That often means putting money in excessively risky assets. But it can also mean buying more-conservative assets with little regard to value. The normally defensive consumer-staples sector is a good example of the latter. Typically, investors flock to these stocks in times of uncertainty, with the...

Hey, there. It looks like you're using an ad blocker. The news and features are funded in part by our advertisers. To support Ad Age and the industry we cover please either: SUBSCRIBE or WHITELIST US DigitalNext It's Time to Fix the Viewability Tower of Babel By Randall Rothenberg. Published on October 24, 2016. Bob Liodice and Marc Pritchard at the ANA Masters of Marketing Conference on Thurdsay. Credit: Clarion Pictures Most Popular At last week's Association of National Advertisers annual Masters of Marketing conference, ANA CEO Bob Liodice ringingly endorsed adoption of the industry's viewable impression standard for digital advertising. His position was backed the same morning by Procter & Gamble CMO Marc Pritchard, who told the 3,000 attendees that unitary standards are needed today if marketing is to remain both efficient and effective as the digital era continues to unfold. It's time for the ad agencies to get with the program. Five years ago our industry accomplished something truly remarkable: the ANA, the American Association of Advertising Agencies (4A's), and IAB came together to fix digital measurement -- the single greatest obstacle to marketer, publisher, and agency growth. Hundreds of interviews and cross-industry task force meetings determined that shifting the currency of digital advertising from the served impression to the viewable impression would benefit everyone by putting digital media on a par with other media where viewability had long been an established baseline. Viewability was to become the currency of the land. Digital media transactions were finally going to be measured based on exposure to individual advertisements, making digital the perfect medium for brand advertisers. But because of agency recalcitrance, it hasn't worked out that way. Credit: iStock/Alex Potemkin Exhaustive interviews we've conducted with IAB publisher members show that a quarter to half of their revenue operations groups' time is spent addressing the basic mechanics of digital advertising's supply chain -- from inventory to reconciliation to invalid traffic (IVT) formulas to everything in-between. The source of this time-suck is agencies' inconsistent practices, not to mention the lack of dedicated expertise in their account teams. Agencies are simply resisting a move toward industry consensus; each agency -- and in some cases different account groups in the same agency -- follows very different practices for transacting when it comes to accounting for viewability or invalid traffic must be taken into account. As a result, every negotiation is an expensive one-off, and time that otherwise could be spent generating world-class user experiences is spent on valueless, tedious squabbling. The problem goes deeper. Even if a publisher accepts numbers from an agency, the method the publisher has to use to project inventory, optimize campaigns, and reconcile billing can differ from campaign to campaign and brand to brand -- even when it's from the exact same buying teams. It's not that there is one bad actor. It's simply that the agencies (and account teams within the agencies) aren't taking the time to consider the time and resource drain caused by their lack of coordination and the lack of common business rules. This inefficiency impinges on better uses of time and money, which would benefit the very brands they serve. To be sure, these business rules do exist. The Media Rating Council (MRC), the decades-old, Congressionally-chartered, independent, cross-industry supervisory body charged by our associations with overseeing the development and implementation of viewability standards, has done a remarkable job writing the rules of the road for modern media measurement. The problem is those rules are being honored by agencies only in the breach. This is unacceptable. It's business malpractice. If publishers, out of sheer neglect, required a business activity that forced brand teams to spend 25% to 50% of their time on valueless mechanics, there would be an uproar -- and outright revolt. Now is the time to take a more aggressive, consistent, and substantive stand on the issue. IAB has been and intends to remain a good partner with the 4As, the ANA, and the MRC in Making Measurement Make Sense. But good partnership demands transparency and honesty. Effective immediately, IAB will be shining a bright light on this issue and calling the industry to the table to collectively solve this problem. We will call out bad practices. We will highlight the contradictory practices in which agencies engage. We will illuminate the costs of unnecessary contract provisions. And we will work hard to gain consensus not just on the idea of viewability, but the practice of viewability. Among other activities, the newly formed Viewability Working Group within the IAB Ad Ops Council will be charged with revising the IAB make-good recommendations for viewability by the end of the year. Expect many more initiatives in this area as we head towards the IAB Ad Operations Summit in New York this November. The stakes are too high for us not to take bold action quickly or fail to monitor industry progress in this endeavor. Viewability is a remarkable achievement, but it only works when all parties define viewability-based transactions in the same way. We need the buy-side to step up and agree that as an industry, we must have a more common way of transacting. Draining half our time and resources on basic account mechanics is intolerable. Everyone needs to be part of this solution.

The 5th anniversary promotion slated to run for two months commenced last Monday and will end on 10th of December. This is the first time the brand will be putting together a promotion since its inception in 2011. In addition to the consumer promotion, Oral-B will visit various communities in Nigeria to provide free dental checks to people through the Oral B Mobile Dental Clinic Programme which currently reaches over 2 million Nigerians annually. Consumers who purchase a pack of Oral-B Pro-Health toothpaste within the period, stands a chance to win instant prizes ranging from airtime, products, and cash prizes from N10, 000 to N300, 000. Speaking during the media launch of the National Consumer Promotion, Tolulope Adedeji, Brand Marketing Director, P&G Nigeria said; “Oral B has reached more than five million households since we launched in Nigeria five years ago. We are celebrating this milestone with a consumer promotion and Mobile Dental Outreach as a mark of appreciation and celebration of our teeming customers.” “The essence of the promotion is to celebrate and reward Oral-B consumers across the country. At Procter and Gamble, it is our purpose to touch and improve the lives of customers with our brands. We will be rewarding as many winners as possible in the weekly and monthly draws as well as the grand draw of the Oral B National Consumer Promotion”, the Brand Marketing Director added. . “Four (4) winners will get N200, 000 and one mixed case of Oral-B each at the end of the first and second months.

In addition to the monthly and grand prizes, we will be giving out cash prizes weekly as well as daily airtime to winners.” Tolulope also reaffirmed the brands dedication to improving the oral health of all Nigerians through its Mobile Dental Clinic Programme. “A large number of Nigerians do not go for dental checkups nor use the right toothpaste with the right toothbrush and the Oral-B Mobile Dental Clinic programme will provide the opportunity for our customers to enjoy free dental health checks and oral advisory by our accredited dentists across various communities in the country” Ifeoma Chuks-Adizue, Brand Manager for Oral B, also speaking at the event expressed the commitment of the brand in ensuring that people have a healthy oral experience. She added that the introduction of the product was driven by the need to have a truly, all-round protection health toothpaste in a market surrounded by basic fresh breath products.

Participants only need to purchase a pack of Oral-B Pro-Health toothpaste and send the codes on the tube along with their names and locations to the short code. Responses will be sent for entry into the draws. She also encouraged consumers to take advantage of the brand’s Facebook fan page for more information about the promo. ← Messi humiliates Guardiola with a hat-trick UBA, MEC, Inc., Unveils Omni-Channel Payment System, EmailMoni → Subscribe to our Newsletter First name Email * Latest News FG REVS UP FIGHT AGAINST CORRUPTION, SEEKS UN SUPPORT Illegal Bureau De Change: Soldiers, DSS Arrests 15, Recover Millions Of currencies 2 female bombers killed in Borno P&G wins SERA Award for best company in clean water and sanitation Police foil planned kidnap of oil magnate Femi Otedola Columns 1.8 million-year old skull proves first human beings on earth were Africans WEST AFRICA SINGLE CURRENCY: THE LESSON TO LEARN FROM EUROPEAN SINGLE CURRENCY 2015: A year of Endless Possibilities 2015 General Elections: Hope Rises on APGA Candidates 2015: Imo and the Need for Change Photo Gallery Abia Governor commiserates with Sen.

To support Ad Age and the industry we cover please either: SUBSCRIBE or WHITELIST US ANA Annual Meeting 2016 Purpose, Death and the Backstreet Boys: Takeaways From the ANA By Ad Age Staff. Published on October 24, 2016. ANA Masters of Marketing: CMO Roundtable: AFE's Stephen Quinn, Starcom's Kathy Ring and Best Buy's Greg Revelle Credit: Clarion Pictures Most Popular The Association of National Advertisers held its annual Masters of Marketing conference in Orlando, Fla. If you weren't able to make it, we've got a few takeaways below, whether it was Marc Pritchard's advice to marketers, Gary Vaynerchuck's shock talk, or some nostalgia from the Backstreet Boys. And be sure to check out our complete coverage, including stories and videos here. Give your agency a break The marketing and ad agency industries haven't exactly been best pals of late. Witness the ANA's ongoing battle with 4As over media rebates and transparency. But marketers speaking at last week's event extended more than a few olive branches to agencies. "The last few years have been admittedly tough on agencies, P&G included. And it's time to turn the page. The negative narrative needs to stop," said Procter & Gamble Co. Chief Brand Officer Marc Pritchard, who also happens to be the new chairman of the ANA. Diego Scotti, chief marketing officer of Verizon, said: "I hear people blame the agency model, saying it's broken. I think that's frankly a lazy way of thinking about it." Don't be a "fuckface" "If you are running [TV] commercials for a brand that targets consumers 22 and under, you're a fuckface." That was just one of many one-liners Gary Vaynerchuk threw at attendees during one of his harsh-truth speeches. Mr. Vaynerchuk railed about marketers and agencies being wedded to the old ways, stuck in legacy creative habits and measuring things that didn't matter. He repeatedly urged the crowd to look at the history of marketing, particularly the transition from radio to TV and what happened to TV. His final takeaway: "You're going to die," Mr. Vaynerchuk said. "It's an amazing time to be in this industry if you're on the offense, it's the worst time if you're on the defense and 95% of you are on the defense." Don't fall into a "crap trap" Mr. Pritchard was actually not very familiar with Mr. Vaynerchuk before his ANA address. And maybe that's no surprise, because his agency, VaynerMedia, does a whole lot of social-media content for a whole lot of P&G's competitors, including Unilever, L'Oreal and Johnson & Johnson. Mr. Pritchard also isn't a big fan of the word "content," or of pumping out lots of stuff on social media of questionable value, such as a Pepto Bismol video he showed about a boy raised by goats, which didn't make note of the brand involved for more than four minutes. Instead, he'd prefer to see his agencies making fewer, better ads. Improving creativity requires craft that "belongs in the hands of serious professionals," Mr. Pritchard said in his ANA address. "Don't ever accept mediocrity. Don't be seduced into the crap trap of just getting something out. On every part of the canvas, craft matters. Let purpose really power the brand After deciding two years ago to quit selling its $2 billion tobacco category and rebrand, CVS Health saw a 40% lift in its perception as a health leader. Norman de Greve, senior VP, chief marketing officer of the $153.3 billion brand, told the crowd his personal story of how he lost his father to lung cancer and wants to ensure he sticks around to spend time with his own young son Luca. "The important thing is that deeds matter more than creeds, so stand up," said Mr. de Greve to attendees, many of whom ranked the talk as one of the conference's strongest. Let's get "phygital" The ANA got formally introduced to a new buzzword by Alison Lewis, chief marketing officer of Johnson & Johnson's consumer business. It means the convergence of the physical and digital worlds. For J&J, that means merging offline and online retailing and marketing. So, for example, J&J recently launched Aveeno into China via e-commerce first before hitting stores. And Neutrogena successfully mined loyalty-card data from store purchases to serve 88 different digital ads programmatically to 18.1 million households aimed at getting folks who had, for example, bought the brand's cosmetics to also buy its makeup-removing wipes. The campaign generated return of $5.84 in added sales in offline stores for every $1 in ad spending online. It's all part of what the company calls "ambidextrous marketing." Be prepared to hear all this again. Phygital is up to 124,000 Google hits. And it got a second mention from the stage from Ellen Moreau, Sherwin-Williams' senior VP-marketing communications, Americas Group. The paint company has been connecting with customers for years in the digital world with its ColorSnap app. The app lets people find the right paint color for their physical spaces in various digital ways, such as taking photos with their phones or finding images on Pinterest. Consider female voiceovers About 75% of commercial voiceovers are done by men, largely because marketers think they sound more authoritative, said former Walmart CMO and current Alliance for Family Entertainment chair Stephen Quinn at Friday's CMO Roundtable focused on the ANA's #SeeHer gender equality initiative. But research by ad testing firm ABX behind the ANA's Gender Equality Measure shows female voiceovers are actually more effective, which makes sense given that most brands have women as their primary consumer target, Mr. Quinn said. Death to demos? Age-gender demographics remain the way much media, particularly TV, gets bought. But speaking at the same CMO Roundtable, Best Buy CMO Greg Revelle said the retailer has moved completely away from demo targeting. "We're going after people who love technology," he said. "What we've found as we've gone through that is that women love technology as much as men." That's also led Best Buy to change the way it casts ads. Pro wrestling is fake -- but audience engagement is real World Wrestling Entertainment's roots go back 50 years. But at her ANA presentation, WWE Chief Brand Officer Stephanie McMahon reminded attendees that the pro wrestling genre goes back to the days of the Roman Coliseum when "the emperor would decide if a gladiator lived or met his unfortunate alternative. Thank god we've evolved to scripting the outcomes." But while the results might be pre-ordained, the WWE adjusts on the fly based on fan reaction. The engagement has helped WWE reach 700 million social media followers. "Our fans are our secret sauce," Ms. McMahon said. "They are a part of our show. Whether they are chanting, cheering, booing -- they can often even influence what happens during the course of a match. Because if something isn't working, you have to change direction quickly." She added: "Our strategy is that we listen and we respond. … It's like the ultimate grassroots marketing." Do the math "Many of us got into marketing to avoid math class," said Wes Nichols, co-founder of Neustar's MarketShare -- a marketing attribution modeler all about math. And his co-presenter, TD Ameritrade Chief Marketing Officer Denise Karkos, acknowledged she went into marketing at Notre Dame in part because it was the business degree that seemed easiest because all the football players were in the classes. But speaking to a relatively lightly attended Saturday session, they made a strong case for doing the math in marketing. Ms. Karkos noted that she's surrounded herself with strong analytics talent throughout her career, and broke with tradition by showing her TD Ameritrade board detailed return-on-investment data for campaign elements rather than the latest 30-second spot. "Now when I go to the board, they want to know what was the ROI of that digital video I saw?" she said. Ms. Karkos has moved largely -- not entirely -- away from upfront TV commitments and inflexible print schedules in favor of an 80% flexible mix of digital, search and other media to optimize around analytics provided by MarketShare and others. Mr. Nichols said that despite their reputation for number-crunching, packaged-goods marketers are now actually behind other industries, such as entertainment, in analytics savvy. ANA Masters of Marketing: A special performance by the Backstreet Boys, sponsored by iHeartMedia, on Thursday, Oct. 20. Credit: Clarion Pictures Bonus item: Backstreet's back, all right OK, so this one might not be applicable to your marketing strategy. The Backstreet Boys' comeback trail led through Orlando on the way to Las Vegas, and the ANA crowd clearly was enthralled. Attendees crowded the stage and sent so many photos and videos to social media and the folks back home, sometimes ironically, that it temporarily choked even the very high-quality data network of Verizon, whose CMO Diego Scotti had noted his brand's premium positioning earlier in the day. ~ ~ ~ Clarification: An earlier version of this story said that Kimberly-Clark was a client of Vayner Media.

Stay prepared. See what we see ahead for U.S. markets -- now, via this risk-free offer to the Financial Forecast Service. *********  [Editor's Note: The text version of the story is below.] About a third of S&P companies report earnings this week, including Apple, Amazon, Proctor & Gamble, Exxon and Alphabet, the parent company of Google. It's earnings season, and most investors are paying close attention (Reuters, Oct. 9): "If there's something that can help the outlook for earnings, then it's going to be good news for the stock market. It is the most important variable," said [a] chief investment officer. The belief that earnings drive stock prices permeates Wall Street. That sentiment was also expressed in an Oct. 21 CNBC article: Strategists are watching whether earnings growth will sustain further gains in the market. But do corporate earnings really determine the stock market's trend? In a word, the answer is "no." Let's look at just one sample of the evidence from the February 2010 Elliott Wave Theorist: The chart shows that in 1973-1974, earnings per share for S&P 500 companies soared for six quarters in a row, during which time the S&P suffered its largest decline since 1937-1942. This is not a small departure from the expected relationship; it is a history-making departure. Earnings soared, and stocks had their largest collapse for the entire period from 1938 through 2007, a 70-year span! Moreover, the S&P bottomed in early October 1974, and earnings per share then turned down for twelve straight months, just as the S&P turned up! Many market commentators either ignore or are unaware of the evidence which challenges the bedrock theory that earnings drive stock prices. Hence, investors feel safe when corporate earnings are good. They are wary when earnings are bad. These sentiments make sense in an exogenous-cause world. But, as the Theorist has noted: Financial market prices are not set in an exogenous-cause world. You don't buy stocks on record earnings; you buy them on bad earnings. The idea of buying stocks on awful earnings might seem radical, but think back to February-March 2009, when S&P companies were reporting losses, not gains. Even though most of the investment world was gripped with fear, a Special Investment Issue of the Theorist published on Feb. 23, 2009 and said: I recommend covering our short position at today's close. ... Our main job is to keep the money we have. If we exit now, we will do that. Just 10 trading days later on March 9, 2009, the Dow Industrials bottomed and has since advanced about 177%. That market call was based on the Wave Principle, not an exogenous factor like corporate earnings. Remember, the Dow Industrials started its years-long advance when corporations were reporting losses. Jump on once-in-a-lifetime opportunities and avoid dangerous pitfalls that no one else sees coming The U.S. Election is over and market uncertainty is back in full force. Elliott waves can get and keep you ahead of major market moves that will surprise millions of investors. Financial Forecast Service subscribers were prepared for major moves including the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dramatic volatility in stocks in August 2015 and January 2016 -- AND the rally to new highs that began in February. Join them today with this limited-time special offer to get and keep yourself ahead for the rest of this year and into 2017.

N E X T Email Print Save Text:  A A We Are How We Eat: How Grocery Shopping Data Reveals the New Consumer by Rebecca Brooks  |   October 24, 2016  |  1,149 views Tweet Kindle Email Top Change is everywhere. Aging Boomers are moving in with their children, and Millennials linger at home. Dual-income families are more commonplace than ever. And in just three decades, the number of women in the workforce has risen by 20%, shifting their traditional purchasing roles in the marketplace. Many of us have seen our jobs become more time-consuming and demanding, as management wants round-the-clock attention and faster servicing. Shifts in lifestyle are also affecting the way consumers interact with brands. The brand-consumer relationship has transformed dramatically before our eyes and continues to do so. Moreover, new technologies are changing the shopping experience. Those changes are so profound that even something as fundamental as grocery shopping is evolving in completely new ways. Using grocery consumer packaged goods (CPG) as the lens through which we view those changes, we can start to proactively influence change rather than just react to the new consumer. Intelligent shopper insights can help ignite change and inspiration, and allow brands to thrive in a changing landscape. Where We Came From Research on shopping behaviors with CPG is not new. It originated with pioneering research Daniel Starch in the early 20th century. He researched and devised methods to assess the effectiveness of advertising based on CPG purchase behaviors. His research explored consumer recall and interest based on brand advertising—a model used by large companies like General Mills, Proctor & Gamble and many more. Those early models were widely adopted and evolved very little until the 1980s and 1990s, when the "emotional" element was added. Digital Paradigm There has been a lot of denial and resistance to how digital would change our lives as researchers, marketers, and the brands we represent. Initially, we didn't understand how big the digital wave would be—nor its widespread repercussions. In the early 2000s, the epic failures of many of the more promising "dotcoms" seemed to reassure us that changes to our model were not eminent. As digital influence rose and affected all parts of life, however, many companies had to scramble to keep up. We started "duct-taping" existing models to show they can still work—treating digital as just another channel in a multipronged marketing campaign. That didn't work either. We are missing the mark with the new consumer. What Grocery Can Tell Us Grocery is changing and will be shopped entirely differently in the next few years. Shopping apps, beacons, loyalty programs, virtual and augmented reality, and more are creating a sea change in the retail sector. Millennials and Gen Z (Digital Natives) are approaching grocery shopping differently than previous generations did. The new generations have an openness, a promiscuous attitude, toward products as well as a propensity to spend more on higher-quality products that resonate with them on a social level—sustainable, cause-oriented, local, etc. The interplay of price and the added value of a quality or interesting product is very fluid. These shoppers can change priorities often. Based on data from 1,000 shoppers who have bought groceries in the last 24 hours, plus data from shopper journey studies collected over the past six years, we found some interesting trends: 47% of Digital Natives look for product recommendations and suggestions before buying (vs. 31% of older generations) 57% love to be the first to know about new products (vs. 42% of older generations) 64% like to browse aisles to discover new products (vs. 55% of older generations) In short, the Digital Native must be the center of the shopping experience. Interactions with a brand must be easy and convenient, and hit every touchpoint the shopper wishes to explore. From chatter on social media to help the decision-making process all the way to purchase and delivery, the entire process must be seamless. The traditional siloed framework for marketing and selling don't work. Brands must create an end-to-end process that thinks of the new consumer first at every step. What Now? Everything about the way we shop is different and will continue to evolve, according to research. "Duct-taping" doesn't work anymore. Old models should be discarded, and we should rethink the way we do market brands from the ground up as if we were inventing it today. That can mean everything from using new tools for market research, such as digital engagement and reframing the treatment of research respondents, all the way to completely revamping the markers we select for brand success. Today's digital consumer may not be loyal, but we can measure things like awareness, consideration, and advocacy for a picture of performance. To fit the demands of the new consumer, brands need to provide clear, easy access to information. We are used to having every question answered with a simple touch on the screen. Brands need to give their target audiences the information they need so that they don't find it elsewhere. Finding that sweet spot where things like price, value, and meaning come together can help change the way brands are marketing.

The major index futures are currently pointing to a higher open for the markets, with the Dow futures up by 94 points. Early buying interest may be generated in reaction to the latest earnings news, as the quarterly reporting season hits full stride. Visa (V), 3M (MMM), Caterpillar (CAT), General Motors (GM), Procter & Gamble (PG), Sprint (S), AT&T (T), Coca-Cola (KO), Dow Chemical (DOW), Sony (SNE), UPS (UPS), Twitter (TWTR), and Exxon Mobil (XOM) are just a few of the companies due to report their results this week. Overall trading activity may be somewhat subdued, however, as a lack of major U.S. economic data may keep some traders on the sidelines. Reports on consumer confidence, new home sales, durable goods orders, and third quarter GDP are likely to attract attention in the coming days. Stocks turned in another relatively lackluster performance during trading on Friday, as traders focused on the latest batch of earnings news amid a quiet day on the U.S. economic front. The major averages eventually ended the session on opposite sides of the unchanged line. While the Nasdaq rose 15.57 points or 0.3 percent to 5,257.40, the Dow dipped 16.64 points or 0.1 percent to 18,145.71 and the S&P 500 edged down 0.18 points or less than a tenth of a percent to 2,141.16. For the week, the Dow edged slightly higher, while the S&P 500 climbed by 0.4 and the Nasdaq advanced by 0.8 percent. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com Preview: Thanksgiving Week Economic Data Top Ten Corporate Comeback Stories The Most Influential Books In Business More Commentary -Global Stocks Move Modestly Lower Amid Quiet Trading Day - U.S. Commentary Stocks Seeing Modest Weakness In Mid-Day Trading - U.S. Commentary European Markets Pull Back On Light Data Day Stocks Showing A Lack Of Direction In Early Trading - U.S. Commentary Stocks May Show A Lack Of Direction In Early Trading - U.S. Commentary Wall Street On Slippery Grounds Sensex Falls For Fifth Day; Nifty Dips Marginally European Shares Fall As Banks And Miners Retreat FTSE 100 Drifts Lower As Stronger Dollar Hurts Commodity Stocks CAC 40 Slips Into Red As Banks Retreat DAX Rises As Volkswagen Outlines Turnaround Plan Asian Shares Recoup Early Losses European Shares To Open On Lackluster Note; Bank Stocks In Focus Sensex, Nifty Slip Into Red After Flat Start Asian Markets Mostly Higher <<Previous        118 Articles Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus Follow RTT Editor's Pick Most Read Most Emailed Volkswagen To Cut 23,000 Jobs In Germany Cyber Monday Sales Seen Soaring LinkedIn Is Now Blocked In Russia Facebook Stops WhatsApp Data Sharing Across Europe Over EU Criticism Wal-Mart Q3 Profit Declines, But Lifts FY17 Profit View; Stock Down JPMorgan Nears Over $250 Mln Settlement Over China Hiring Probe: Reports Comeback Kid: Donald Trump Hugely Resilient In Business, Too Target Lifts Q4, FY16 Forecast As Q3 Results Top Estimates Snapchat Parent Confidentially Initiates IPO Process Amazon Switching From Wrapping Paper To Reusable Bags Home Depot Black Friday Deals Heavy On Appliances Home Depot Lifts FY EPS View In Line With Market As Q3 Results Top Estimates FDA Snubs DVAX, Keep An Eye On OCUL, It's All Green For BLUE United Airlines Announces Plans For Long-term Earnings Growth Home Depot Black Friday Deals Heavy On Appliances LinkedIn Is Now Blocked In Russia AAA: Low Gas Prices Drive Spike In Thanksgiving Travel United Airlines Restricts Economy To One Small Carry-on BSTC Finds New Use For Old Drug, FHCO Gets A Boost, SUPN Put On Notice Crew Members Hurt As Canadian Plane Swerves To Avoid Possible Drone All Is Well With ACRS, First Avastin Biosimilar In The Works, CLRB Abuzz Vonovia Offers 0.496645 Shares/conwert Shr Or Alternative Cash Of EUR 16.16/shr Nokia Sets Financial & Strategic Targets; Remains Focused On Cost Saving Program Mid-week Mania In Abbreviated Week - Economic Preview United Airlines Restricts Economy To One Small Carry-on United Airlines Announces Plans For Long-term Earnings Growth Target Lifts Q4, FY16 Forecast As Q3 Results Top Estimates Deutsche Wohnen 9-month FFO I Rises Syngenta Gets Argentina Approval For MIRAVIS Duo With Fungicide ADEPIDYN FDA Snubs DVAX, Keep An Eye On OCUL, It's All Green For BLUE Crew Members Hurt As Canadian Plane Swerves To Avoid Possible Drone Merck KgaA Q3 Profit Climbs; Lifts 2016 EBITDA Pre-exceptionals Outlook United Internet 9-month EBITDA Rises Manz AG Posts Narrower Loss In 9-month - Quick Facts Smiths Group Q1 Revenues Climb; Says FY Forecast Unchanged - Quick Facts EasyJet Fiscal Year Profit Declines; Revenue Down 0.4% - Quick Facts Copyright © 2016 RTTNews.

The Director for Policy in Africa at the United States Chamber of Commerce, Dr. Leila Ndiaye, in this interview with Obinna Chima, spoke about the objectives of the initiative as well as its capacity to enhance bilateral trade between African countries and the U.S. Excerpts: What is the objective of the U.S-Africa Business Center ? The objective is to increase bilateral trade between the U.S. and Africa. The other objective is to make that American companies are being understood and take part in the emerging Africa. That is because everywhere you go today, they talk about emerging Nigeria and emerging Africa. So, we want to be part of this emerging trend. But most importantly, we want African companies and business leaders to sit down on the same table with American companies and tell them how to do business with Africa as well as how they can together, partner to do business. It is either we help them do business in America or together they do business as partners. We have realised a long time ago that Africa is an untapped market. We know that Africa is not just one country, it is made up of 54 countries, compared with a lot of people who think Africa is one country. We know that Nigeria is the biggest market, etc. But, how is it that we can help? It is a win-win situation because we want to make money, and you (African businesses) also want to make money. But it comes with very favourable investment climate, it comes with the know-how of the market. But only you can tell me how to do business in your country , just as I am the only one that can tell you how to do business in my country. So, that is a win-win. But why did the Chamber come up with this initiative when we had the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), or has AGOA failed? AGOA didn’t fail. But one can say that it didn’t reach its full potential. And both sides did not benefit from it. You have to understand that AGOA has more than 6,000 products that can enter the U.S. free of taxes, back and forth. But people are not aware of that. Only a handful of companies in Nigeria and everywhere in Africa, really benefitted. We have extended AGOA for another 10 years. So, we must focus on what is beyond AGOA. We established this center because we are proactive. We launched it last December. We advocated strongly for AGOA, we did the same for the American-EXIM Bank and as you can recall, last July, it was history. Some people had to fight so that the Congress would re-authorise what the U.S. Chamber can do. So, what we did was to make sure that we can do business in a very sane environment between both regions. Does the Chamber have specific criteria for organisations or even individuals  that intend to join the center? You know, we never had any African company as a member of the U.S Chamber. But we have opened the door for African companies. The first thing we are concerned about is the Foreign Practice  Act. So, you can be as wealthy as you want, but you have to pass some criteria. If you never worked in your life, and because your father was a Governor, and he stole money and gave you a company, you can be the wealthiest person on earth, but you can never be a member of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. We promote entrepreneurship, but entrepreneurship comes with a spirit. So, it is something that you need to have within your system, to build and create jobs. I don’t have anything about people’s inheritance, that is not what I am talking about. I am talking about money coming from the government, money laundering. You have to be a real entrepreneur. And any company with government funding cannot be part of the U.S. Chamber. What about a company that got its seed capital through government funding and after some years it developed capacity and has been sustaining itself, is such a firm not qualified to be a member of the Chamber? If you are a company, and you participated in a bid and for example, the government gives you licence to import rice, we won’t say know to such a company. But if you create your company and its revenues come from government, we cannot accept such a company. We have to make sure that everything is clean. Then, you have to understand the philosophy. The philosophy is the triple ‘A’ solution, which is – we advocate on your behalf, we advice you and we give you access. But the access tag we give you is unthinkable. At the government level, the private sector level, we host approximately 130 delegations in a year at the Chamber. There is no Head of State in this world that comes into Washington to meet the Department of States, President Obama or any U.S. government official, without stopping at the U.S. Chamber. This is because that is where the economy of America resides. That is where the dollars really reside. Does the center offer grants to members? We don’t offer grants. We give access to our members. We have more than three million companies whichmake us the largest business federation in the world. Consider the U.S. Chamber to be like the federal Chamber. Beneath us, you have 2,800 Chambers, both local and regional. Then, we have Chambers all over the world totaling 117. So, that is the network. We don’t give grant to anybody because we are not a bank. We are a policy shop. But we give access to where the resources can be, because we advice you and we open the door for you. Now, if your product is bankable, of course, we would look for who is interested within our members and it would be your responsibility to do your business pitch. However, I will make sure that you get to the right person or partner. I can give you an example of a success story of a company. We talked about AGOA, now we are talking about funding and how you do things. There is a company from Senegal that is in agro-business. It was the only company in the country that was really doing huge volumes in terms of refines,  jams, juices in America, coming from the West Coast. She is a member of the U.S. Chamber and actually the second African companies that joined the Chamber. Exactly five months ago, we invited the President of Afreximbank. He came, they sat down and discussed. She is already in five states and our plan was for her to go to Walmart. Walmart is my member. I want her to be in Whole Foods, which is also my member. Walmart has 700 stores in Africa, but not with the name Walmart and I want her to be in at least 20 of those stores. We sat down, we looked at the products. She was exporting to the U.S via AGOA, a member of the Chamber. Ninety per cent of her employees are women, 10 per cent are deaf people and so she is like socially responsible. And the Afreximbank promised to take the business to the next level. It took him just two hours to instruct his people to invest $15 million into this company for the lady to double her capacity of production. That is what we do. So, when a Head of State comes and if you are our member, you have the opportunity for one-on-meetings. There, you can address your priorities. Last year, we hosted President Muhammadu Buhari during his first official visit and we had more than 400 people in a room. That tells you how Nigeria is portrayed and how much the U.S. private sector is involved. So, we give you access, we advice you and we wish you goodluck. Not goodluck in a way that we want to get rid of you. That is because we would be there with you until we make sure you find a solution. But, I will never instruct a bank. So, what does it take to be a member? First of all, at the national level in the U.S, you just need to be registered in the U.S, no matter the size of your company. But if you are an international, then we have different programmes. There is the international division with all the different continents represented. I represent Africa as the Director. But there is a Know-Your-Customer (KYC) procedure that I do. KYC is very important. As someone with African origin, I want the best for my continent. I want to show America the best from my continent. So, I want the best entreprenuers who can roll their sleeves with Americans. For me, that is how I see emerging Africa. If you are the CEO of Dangote, Zenith Bank or any company from Africa, you should be able to sit down with the CEO of Procter and Gamble and agree on what they want to do together. Presently, how many Nigerian companies do you have as members? We cannot say, but we have considerable number. For Nigeria, what I like to do is to create a specific programme to be called the U.S-Nigeria CEO dialogue, which would be a specific Programme for Nigeria. It would take place in the first quarter of 2017 and by then I hope to have gotten more members from Nigeria, so that they can participate. It is also for us to have medium-sized and large sized American companies in the meeting. But at the first edition of the programme, I will just go with the top 10 Nigerian companies and top 20 or top 50 US companies. Top 10 in terms of what? In terms of the longevity of the company, turnover and as I said before, it has to be a company with a success story and a representative of the private sector. That is because any company that succeeds in Nigeria, should be able to spread or expand to Ivory Coast, Benin, Togo, Burkina Faso, etc, and we can help. The company I talked about in Senegal, today, her products are on the shelves in Ivory Coast, Gambia, Burkina Faso, and every where. But how did it start? It started with the meeting she had with us. But why did it take the U.S this long to integrate businesses in Africa? I think there have been a misrepresentation of the presence of  U.S. businesses in Africa. A company like Procter and Gamble or even General Electric. General Electric has been in Africa for over 100 years. The U.S private sector businesses have always been here. I always laugh because I tell people that there is no village where you don’t find gillete blade, which is made by Procter & Gamble. When you want to search for information on your phone, what do you use? Google. So, Africans consume America everyday. From Microsoft when you turn on your computer, from using using Google, you are creating jobs both sides (Africa and America), you use Facebook, you do the same. Procter & Gamble has more than 300 hundred products in Africa. These are American products. Where I agree with you is that we didn’t hear much about the U.S in areas such as infrastructure as much as lately, the Chinese. That is where I think the Chinese have made so much noise by building railroads, bridges, etc, across Africa. Maybe that is why some have the feeling that the U.S has not been present. But the U.S has always been present. But we want to do more infrastructure because there cannot be any development if there is lack of infrastructure. We have started with the programme, Power Africa. We need electricity in Africa and the U.S. has taken the step. So, we want to be more present in things that people see and feel. So, we want to be more involved in all sectors and we want to help Africa move from raw materials to develop the value chain processes in Africa. Why is it that Africa will always sell its coffee or cocoa as a raw material to the West? Why can’t they be processed into finished products, using our technology and sell in the African market? These are the things we want to be involved in. Currency is a major part of trade and we have FX controls in some countries in Africa. How does the Chamber assist its members in areas such as FX, Customs as well as the issue of multiple taxation faced by businesses in Africa? We do and I will give you some examples. Firstly, you know that you have the Common External Tarriff (CET) in ECOWAS. One morning I recieved an e-mail from one of our members about that. Secondly, there was a specific product that the tax was supposed to be 10 per cent, we sent our material to this country, and suddenly they said it was 35 per cent. That souldn’t have been because they have a common tarriff. So, I looked at it and said that wasn’t right because it is the same law that should be applied and implemented. So, that was how we engaged ECOWAS and we had an MoU with ECOWAS, which took care of the problem. So, that was why I said we are a policy shop. So, if the law is not favourable to any private sector person, we would make that that the law becomes a reality. The second question was about FX controls. This year, we signed an MoU also with the West Africa Bankers Association (WABA) and we were very concerned about the naira and the implication of the FX issue for foreign companies. We also invited the President of the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE), Aigboje Aig-Imoukhuede, to address our members in Washington on the FX issues in Nigeria. We chose Aig-Imoukhuede because of his experience as a former bank CEO and he understands the issues. Our members asked him questions and he was able to advice them better. Those who wanted to withdraw did not after the session. So, that is the kind of platform that we offer so as we come out solution and to enable each person to prosper. The U.S-Africa Business Center is going to turn a year by December and the Africa Department of the U.S. Chamber is just nine years old. But it doesn’t mean that the U.S. was not interested in Africa. The U.S. has always done business in Africa. But, it is the will of the private sector that made the U.S. Chamber to create the Africa Department. Does the Chamber also support startups? We do have a programme at the national level because you have to start somewhere. Of course, we support startups. Recently, we met with young entrepreneurs from 30 nations in Africa, startups only. We gave them the opportunity to present their projects. They went into a competition and we selected those that had the best business plan, etc. So, we do once in a while, engage with startups to make sure that we coach them. But our priority today is at the macro level. Our second priority is to make sure we have a strong programme for SMEs. Our third priority is to have a programme for women and make sure that we give them all the tools to prosper, especially in three sectors where we don’t see a lot of women – energy, agriculture and ICT.

Pritchard, who both heads up marketing at P&G and has just been appointed as Chairman of the Association of National Advertisers (ANA), drilled down into this topic during the trade body's 2016 Masters of Marketing Conference. And he suggested that turning the craft of advertising into a "force for growth" would require boosting creative standards, an area that can be neglected as marketers struggle to keep pace with the increasing number of channels at their disposal. "So, job one is to be the absolute best at our craft," Pritchard said. (For more, including further tips for brands, read Warc's exclusive report: Pritchard's three priorities for the future of advertising.) "Things like ad blocking may be a problem, but we actually have a much bigger opportunity to focus on, and that is growth. "Each and every one of us can make a difference by stepping up and elevating the skills and the craft to deliver better advertising that's of higher quality." Elaborating on this theme, he argued that advertising can be a "force for good" in much broader terms if it seeks to "help make the world better" in ways large and small. "What I'm really talking about here is everyday advertising that builds in points of view on things that matter to people, and where your brand matters," he said. "Our voice can be used to step up on important matters such as gender equality, racial bias, diversity and inclusion, and environmental sustainability." In order to give these issues the attention they deserve, though, marketers must first address problems of measurement, where current shortcomings limit the impact of their work and take time away from more valuable tasks. "We're spending way too much of our time, and wasted investment, on non-standard and faulty measurement – and a media supply chain that is murky at best, and, in some cases, even fraudulent," Pritchard said. "Surely, if we can invent driverless cars and virtual-reality experiences, we can find a way to track and verify media accurately. It's time that we come together, though, to solve these problems. And this is not any one piece of the industry; this is the entire industry."

A favorite of Sinatra and Lemmy, you can actually buy this 150-year old adult beverage by the barrel if you want. Rich Duprey (TMFCop) Oct 23, 2016 at 9:21AM Editor's note: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Brown-Forman's Jack Daniel's brand had not made the Interbrand list of top 2016 brands. The author and the Fool regret the error. Image source: Getty Images. Now that Anheuser-Busch InBev (NYSE:BUD) has completed its acquisition of SABMiller, the $104 billion deal has created a beer-brewing behemoth that straddles just about every continent and has operations, sales, or employees in just about every country. The maker of Budweiser, Bud Light, and Corona beer is truly a global powerhouse that accounts for more than a quarter of the world's beer production, 45% of the industry's profits, and owns the first and/or second top-selling beers in more than a handful of markets, including the U.S., where it will continue to have a 45% share of the market. The merged company is also the fifth largest consumer products company in the world, behind such giants as Procter & Gamble and PepsiCo, but ahead of Coca-Cola and Mondelez International. Together, A-B InBev and Miller will have $55 billion in annual revenues and around $21 billion in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, more than any other consumer products company. A beer by any other name According to brand consultancy company Interbrand, Budweiser by itself was already the biggest global alcohol brand valued at $15.1 billion, up 8% from last year's ranking and one position higher. Interbrand puts a lot into determining a brand's value. The ISO-certified methodology looks at how a business delivers on customer expectations to what it does to drive economic value, with the rankings based on a brand's cumulative value in three key areas: The financial performance of the branded products and services. The role the brand plays in influencing customer choice. The strength the brand has to command a premium price or secure earnings for the company. From that assessment, it organizes the list of top 100 companies. In the 2016 survey, the Budweiser brand came in 30th; last year it was 31st. That it was the biggest adult beverage brand probably surprises no one, but like me, you might have wondered which alcohol brands followed after. Can you guess who's on top? I examined Interbrand's list of the best global companies and sifted out only those that made adult beverages. On more than one occasion, I raised an eyebrow at which company was there and which wasn't, but the following list identifies the most valuable brands, their Interbrand rank, and their brand value: Budweiser (30) $15.099 billion Jack Daniel's (85) $5.193 billion Heineken (87) $5.123 billion Corona (93) $4.059 billion Johnny Walker (95) $4.317 billion Smirnoff (96) $4.252 billion Moet & Chandon (97) $4.118 billion One trend that stands out is the even split between beer and spirits, indicating there is no real difference between highbrow and lowbrow tastes. The absence of any of Miller's beer brands is also notable. That's particularly interesting because A-B InBev just acquired Miller on the strength of its global brand portfolio, particularly its leading position in countries such as Africa and Latin America (albeit for brands not under the Miller label). Also, aside from Anheuser-Busch having two brands on the list (Bud and Corona), the only other company to earn that distinction is distiller Diageo (NYSE:DEO), which owns the Johnny Walker brand of Scotch whisky and Smirnoff vodka. Everything tastes better with Jack The Jack Daniel's family of whiskey accounts for 55% of Brown-Forman's (NYSE: BF-A) (NYSE: BF-B) depletions, or shipments sent directly to retail or from distributors to wholesale and retail customers, a metric that is commonly regarded as a proxy for consumer demand. Its original black label Old No. 7 accounts for 55% of all the distiller's brand depletions and 30% of its total portfolio. Image source: David Pacey via Flickr. Moreover, Jack Daniel's has the distinction of being the fourth largest premium spirits brand and the biggest selling brand of American whiskey in the world. Yet having such a powerhouse brand also runs the risk of Brown-Forman being a one-trick pony that needs to always come up with variations on a theme. And that it has, and it's done so quite well, thank you. Tennessee Honey, a honey-flavored whiskey as its name suggests, is already the world's 15th largest premium brand, and its cinnamon-flavored Tennessee Fire is taking aim at Sazerac's leading Fireball brand. There's little question as to why people can walk into any bar a simply say they want a "Jack" and bartenders understand what they mean. Why Heineken is a top-shelf brewer As Heineken (NASDAQOTH: HEINY) calls itself, it is "is the world's most international brewer," led principally by its premium eponymous brand that is sold in more than 170 countries. It's also the second-biggest beer brand on the Interbrand global list. Image source: Felix Triller via Flickr. Heineken beer represents just 15% of the brewer's total volume, but it accounts for well over 30% of its profits. The company still sees another 10 to 20 years of growth ahead of it. When investors look to invest in alcoholic beverage companies, once having made the choice to put their money into beer, it's often a case of looking at the biggest, like Anheuser-Busch InBev, or in the niches, like craft beer. However, imports are certainly worth taking note of as the Brewers Association, which represents the craft beer industry, notes, import beer volumes grew 6% in 2015, accounting for a 22% share of the market -- almost double craft beer's share. Now, as sales of craft beer eases up, imports can shine through. As Heineken's Most Interesting Man in the World would say (yes, it also owns Dos Equis beer), "Stay thirsty, my friends." Rich Duprey has no position in any stocks mentioned.

However, another segment of the investing world is looking to avoid any election drama one way or the other. Instead of looking for stocks that could rise or fall depending on the outcome, these investors are looking for solid investments that will likely not be impacted regardless of which candidate wins. Related Link: What To Expect From Stocks Under A Clinton Presidency Here’s a look at five election-proof stocks to consider. 5 'Safe' Bets Come November 9 1. EOG Resources Inc (NYSE: EOG). In the second debate, both candidates discussed their energy plans, and both specifically mentioned natural gas as one of the centerpieces of the future U.S. energy industry. Barclays recently named EOG as its top natural gas stock pick. 2. Procter & Gamble Co (NYSE: PG). Regardless of who wins the election and what it does to the country, people will still need deodorant, soap and toilet paper. Proctor & Gamble is one of the biggest blue chip consumer staples stocks in the market, and it also pays a generous 3.1 percent election-proof dividend. 3. Kroger Co (NYSE: KR). And where do people go to buy their deodorant, soap and toilet paper? The election outcome will likely have little impact on people’s grocery shopping, which is good news for Kroger investors. 4. Blue Buffalo Pet Products Inc (NASDAQ: BUFF) No matter how bad or good things get in Washington, most people’s furry friends still get the same serving of the same dog or cat food every single day. Blue Buffalo investors care about as much about the election outcome as your pets do. 5. Anheuser-Busch InBev SA NV (ADR) (NYSE: BUD). Depending on how things go down on November 8, the election outcome might make you want to have a few more drinks than usual. However, the fact is that people’s alcoholic beverage budgets tend to remain fairly constant no matter what else is going on in the world, making stocks like Anheuser Busch relatively unaffected by the outcome of the election.

Dubai’s Jebel Ali Free Zone (JAFZA) has been using major industrial trade shows around the world to court companies, touting its attributes as the UAE’s trade and logistics hub for the wider Middle East region, and also as an “ideal site” to set up manufacturing and trading operations. The recent Automechanika trade show of Frankfurt, rated as the world’s largest event for the auto-parts and components sector, was a prominent venue where JAFZA set up a pavilion-size booth to recruit companies to set up operations at its facility. In an interview with the American Journal of Transportation at the Automechanika show, Ibrahim Mohamed Al Janahi, the deputy CEO and chief commercial officer of JAFZA, said that over 7,000 companies from over 120 countries had established operations in the JAFZA. These, he added, included more than 100 of the 500 Fortune companies.  “About 73% of them are in trading, storage, transhipment while some 23% are engaged in manufacturing and assembly operations.  We have Nestle, Mars, Proctor and Gamble, to name a few names.  The UAE (United Arab Emirates) has a population of nine million … our biggest trading partners are China, India, Middle East, Iran, Britain, France and Germany,” he explained.

"From my perspective, this is the heart of earnings season. How earnings trends are developing is top of my mind," said David Lefkowitz, senior equity strategist at UBS Wealth Management Americas. "The market wants to see the good earnings data is not just about financials," he said. Apple, the largest S&P 500 stock by market capitalization, is the highlight of Tuesday's earnings reports. Analysts polled by Reuters on average expect the iPhone maker to report earnings of $1.65 a share on revenue of $46.89 billion for the quarter. "Tech is the largest sector in terms of an earnings weight," Lefkowitz said. "Getting a better handle on trends there is going to be important. We've seen some weakness in industrials. [We] want to see how broad-based that is." The Nasdaq 100 closed Monday at a record high of 4,909.97 after hitting an all-time intraday high of 4,911.59, helped by gains in Microsoft, Amazon.com, Apple and Alphabet, Google's parent company. show chapters <p>A-list tech earnings on deck</p> <p>Paul Meeks, tech investor, and John Traynor, People&rsquo;s United Wealth Management CIO, give their views on upcoming tech earnings from Apple, Amazon and Alphabet.</p> A-list tech earnings on deck    Monday, 24 Oct 2016 | 2:51 PM ET | 02:28 Tech led the S&P 500 higher, which closed up 10 points at 2,151. The broad index gains were helped by more than $100 billion in corporate deals, including AT&T's more than $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner, announced heading into Monday's trading session. The major banks set a positive tone to earnings season with better-than-expected third-quarter results, helped by a surge in revenue from bond trading. The majority of S&P 500 names have yet to report, with about one-third of the index posting results this week. "I hope what the market's signaling or finding out [is the] earnings recession doesn't exist or never really existed," said Bill Stone, chief investment strategist at PNC Asset Management. Quarterly earnings per share have declined for four straight quarters as a sharp plunge in oil prices along with a strong dollar weighed heavily on corporate profits. If all remaining companies report earnings that match estimates, earnings per share will return to growth this quarter, up 1.1 percent from the third quarter last year, according to Monday's Thomson Reuters data. Other earnings reports due ahead of Tuesday's open include DuPont, Eli Lilly, Fiat Chrysler, General Motors, Merck, Novartis, Procter & Gamble, United Technologies, Corning, Freeport-McMoRan, KeyCorp, KKR, Lockheed Martin, Pentair, Sherwin-Williams, Sprint, TD Ameritrade, Under Armour, Valero Energy, Whirlpool, AK Steel, II-VI, Janus, JetBlue, Spirit Airlines and TransUnion. Firms set to post quarterly results after the close include Chipotle Mexican Grill, Capital One, Discover Financial, Edwards Lifesciences, Express Scripts, Juniper Networks, Vertex Pharma, iRobot, Pandora Media, Panera Bread and Owens-Illinois. Among the few pieces of minor economic data scheduled for release Tuesday are August home price indexes from S&P Case-Shiller and the Federal Housing Finance Agency. Consumer confidence for October is scheduled for release later in the morning from The Conference Board. Analysts expect the index to tick down to 101.5 from 104.1 in September, according to a consensus estimate from Reuters. The Richmond Fed survey is also due Tuesday morning. Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart is scheduled to speak at 1:20 p.m. ET on lending and investing in community development. Fed speakers will then be in a quiet period ahead of the central bank's meeting next week. The Treasury is set to hold a two-year note auction in the afternoon. Treasury yields rose Monday, with the two-year yield near 0.84 percent in late trade and the 10-year yield around 1.76 percent following an encouraging pickup in the October flash U.S. Markit manufacturing PMI. The U.S. dollar index was little changed in late trade Monday after hitting intraday 97.188, its highest since February 3. The euro was around $1.088. "For now, everything depends on the election," said Athanasios Vamvakidis, head of G-10 FX strategy in Europe at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. If Hillary Clinton wins the U.S. presidential election and federal government gridlock continues with a Republican-dominated Congress, Vamvakidis said the last leg of the dollar rally will come around December, when the Fed likely raises rates and the European Central Bank probably extends its asset purchase program. The euro dollar is near his year-end target of $1.08. Overseas on Tuesday, ECB President Mario Draghi is set to speak in Berlin on "Stability, Equity and Monetary Policy."

Published on October 24, 2016. Marketers will especially appreciate the improvements seen in The Wearality Sky VR headset, David Berkowitz writes. Credit: Wearality Most Popular After attending a conference about making virtual media come alive in a city that is virtually non-existent on Western maps, the future of an emerging field has never felt so real to me. Perhaps I had watched too many X-Men movies on China Southern Airlines, but attending the Virtual Reality Summit in Gui'An, China, on October 8 felt reminiscent of those scenes where Professor Charles Xavier rolls his wheelchair into Cerebro and tracks down mutants all over the world. If you're in New York or Silicon Valley, or in Austin or Raleigh, you might have some sense of the activity going on outside of your immediate surroundings. But flying halfway around the world to a part of China so remote that it is literally not on the map (seriously, try searching for "Gui'An" or "Guian" in Google Maps), one can appreciate just how many "mutants" are gathering in disparate locations to learn from each other and collaborate. These networks keep growing. One of the hosts of the conference, ARinChina, brought me over along with a group of about a half-dozen Westerners. This media company connects a community of 60,000 developers, all of whom are invested in staying ahead of breakthrough technologies like virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR) and the hybrid known as mixed reality (MR). The AR track where I presented was hosted by RAVV, a new technology think tank that is pulling together subject matter experts across robotics, artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles, VR and AR. RAVV is building an international ecosystem that includes its own approaches for startup incubation, knowledge sharing and other collaborative endeavors. I'm not being hyperbolic or even envoking the Chinese tradition of saving face when I say it was a humbling experience. I felt like a dwarf among giants. If this was a tech conference version of the X-Men, I was looking around and meeting Storm, Mystique and (fittingly for VR) Cyclops. Me? I was the extra whose superpower was using chopsticks for a meal without spilling anything on himself. Here are a few observations from the conference, including discussions held during the weekend of tours and demonstrations in Gui'An: AR works best when it's invisible. This was the theme of my talk, and it was a constant, implicit refrain throughout the summit. Consider Snapchat Lenses and Pokémon Go. People use these apps because they're fun, and odds are the vast majority have no clue that AR is involved. B2B will be a major driver of AR and MR. You know who most appreciates head-mounted displays? Professionals who work with their hands, need content delivered directly in front of them, and don't care about how they look. What's likely is that a lot of companies will initially invest in these technologies and related content to improve efficiency, reduce errors, and save costs. More consumer-friendly applications will follow. Imagine empowering people to enhance their skills at various jobs, from basic home and car repair, to cooking, to DIY projects. Brands must constantly hone their value proposition. I was having a discussion with a presenter about the viability of some ideas for brands, and the brand name Procter and Gamble came up. I said it was unlikely people will take out their phones in the grocery store and try out some AR experience, scanning around to find the best kind of laundry detergent. But if a brand created an app that could use the camera to recognize stains and tell people how to clean them, any parent with young children at home would love it. Some of the most important technical specifications are about the optics. The quality of the lenses makes a tremendous difference when using any kind of headset. I got to try the new VR viewer from Wearality, a company run by optics pioneer David A. Smith. The crispness of the screen, along with the breadth of the field of view, delivers a breakthrough in quality, especially for any device at a sub-$100 price point. Marketers will be especially appreciative of improvements here, as they'll then be able to ensure consumers appreciate the investment they make in producing content for these new media. It takes a village, and a country, and a world. The goal of the Virtual Reality Summit wasn't just to show off cool gadgetry, though that was part of it. It was to pull together support for business development, content creation, financing, manufacturing, infrastructure, and hardware and software innovation. These are topics of interest for Gui'An in particular, which has quickly become China's big data capital. But they are also topics for everyone investing their time, money, and energy in these fields. To get a sense of how global the emerging mixed reality field is, consider that, in February, China's e-commerce giant Alibaba led the $800 million Series C round for Florida-based Magic Leap, an MR startup. As our daily reality becomes more virtual and augmented, it doesn't matter where someone is on the map. This field is connecting far-flung practitioners, hinting at a time, soon, when AR, VR and MR will connect people in ways never before possible.

Consumer goods companies have been grappling with slowing volume sales over the past year, hit by falling household spending across the world, fierce competition from retailers’ own-brand products and economic weakness in emerging markets. The pound’s plunge since the June Brexit vote has put extra pressure on firms like Unilever, whose brands include Marmite yeast spread and Dove soap, by driving up the cost of their imports to Britain and dollar-traded commodities. Last week the Anglo-Dutch company tried to raise the prices of a range of products by 10 per cent in Britain, prompting a stand-off with the country’s largest supermarket, Tesco, which balked at the demand. The dispute — which showed an early effect of Britain’s decision to leave the EU — was quickly resolved, but gave the public a rare glimpse into the difficult discussions that industry sources say are happening across the sector. An executive at one of Unilever’s main rivals said it was also discussing possible price increases with UK supermarkets. A source at another rival said it faced the same pressures as Unilever but that it was not yet ready to raise prices and first wanted to exhaust cost-cutting options. The Unilever row illustrated how reliant the company is on price rises — rather than increased volume sales — to make more money from shoppers around the world and how difficult that strategy may be to keep up, even as volatile currency and commodity environments drive up costs. The day “Marmitegate” dominated the front pages of British newspapers, the company reported a 3.2 per cent rise in quarterly sales — with a 0.4 per cent drop in the number of goods sold comfortably offset by a 3.6 per cent increase in prices. It is not alone among its peers in this trend of slowing volumes and rising prices. This could put the sector on course for a long battle with big retailers like British supermarkets, which conversely need high sales volumes because of their tight margins and fixed costs, and low prices due to fierce competition in the domestic market. How this conflict might play out is unclear, with the Tesco row perhaps just a taste of what is to come. French food group Danone, which makes Activia yoghurt and Aptamil baby formula, reported a 0.7 per cent fall in third-quarter volumes this week but, like Unilever, used price increases to drive a 2.1 per cent rise in sales. Britain’s Reckitt Benckiser’s, which does not break down its sales by volumes and price rises, reported its weakest quarterly growth in over five years on Wednesday. Nestle also posted its weakest sales growth in more than a decade on Thursday, with volumes slowing. Procter & Gamble reports results this week. Unilever, Reckitt and P&G all declined to comment on any future plans for price increases, while Danone did not respond to a request for comment. WHY UNILEVER?: Unilever is the No 1 supplier of ice cream, deodorants, bath and shower products and margarines and spreads in many countries, and has invested in marketing and brand innovation over the years, which gives it pricing power. But industry experts said the company’s request for 10 per cent price rises in Britain was aggressive, and that they did not expect its rivals to demand such high increases. “We think all UK food producers are going to need price increases in the next few months but we can’t see 10 per cent,” said Jefferies analyst Martin Deboo. “Unilever’s pricing strategy does seem to be about as aggressive as it could be.” Unilever said its reliance on price increases was largely down to factors including weak consumer demand in emerging markets and the sharp devaluation of Latin American currencies. It is more exposed to these regions than most of its peers. Emerging markets as a whole account for almost 60 per cent of its sales, with Latin America generating 16 per cent of sales. Much of the company’s third-quarter price rises were to offset currency devaluations in Latin America. It said currency swings globally had made its commodity costs 600 million euros ($659.5 million) more expensive this year, with a large part of that coming from Argentina, Brazil and Mexico. — Reuters About the author View all articles by Oman Observer ← Youth annual art exhibition opens today Fleeing Brexit to Berlin?

Wall Street expectations are perhaps highest for a chemicals giant and a leading credit services company. However, just one of these two is expected to show growth on the top line. The third-quarter earnings reporting season is in full swing, and more than a third of the Dow Jones Industrial Average components have shared their latest results so far. Most of the rest of the 30 Dow members are on tap to report this week, and the Wall Street expectations are perhaps highest for E I Du Pont De Nemours And Co (NYSE: D), better known as DuPont, and Visa Inc (NYSE: V). The Wall Street consensus forecasts call for earnings at both to have increased by double-digit percentages from the same period of last year. But analysts see top line growth from only one of them, for the period when DuPont moved forward on its merger with Dow Chemical and Visa provided the card of choice for Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ: COST). When Delaware-based conglomerate DuPont shares its third-quarter results, the Wall Street forecast is that it will post a profit of $0.20 per share and $4.86 billion in revenue. That would compare with the earnings of $0.13 per share and revenue of $4.87 billion last year. It also would be the lowest revenue and second lowest profit results in the past eight quarters. The consensus of just eight Estimize respondents have pegged EPS at $0.23 and revenue at $5.35 billion for the three months that ended in September. In the previous two quarters, Estimize overestimated on the bottom line numbers, though the revenue number was just about on target for the second quarter. Related Link: This Week's Dow Earnings: Low Expectations For Exxon And Chevron Wall Street's consensus forecast for Visa is for earnings per share (EPS) to have risen by 11 cents from the same period of last year to $0.73. That estimate is unchanged in the past 60 days. The consensus of 137 Estimize respondents calls for $0.74 for the fiscal fourth quarter that ended in September. Note that Wall Street has underestimated EPS results in the past three quarters. Estimize predicts that the revenue of this San Francisco-based payments technology giant will total $4.20 billion for the quarter, up more than 16 percent from the year-ago period. Wall Street is a bit more optimistic, with its consensus forecast set at $4.23 billion. Back in the third quarter, Visa's revenue narrowly missed both forecasts. Visa is scheduled to report its results after the closing bell on Monday, while DuPont is expected to post its numbers first thing the following morning. Also this week, the consensus forecasts call for per-share earnings at Dow members Apple, Chevron, Coca-Cola and Exxon Mobil to be lower than a year ago. The EPS at Procter & Gamble are anticipated to be about the same as in the year-ago period. On the other hand, the consensus forecasts call for a gain in EPS at Boeing, Caterpillar, Merck, 3M and United Technologies, relative to a year ago. Only a handful of Dow components will be left to report after that, but watch for upcoming results from Cisco, Pfizer and Walt Disney. Full ratings data available on Benzinga Pro.

"Right now, they're scaring the daylights out of me," said Commissioner Wayne Guilfoyle. "It's going to be a tough budget year because we're hiring people with big salaries to sit and do nothing while other employees are out digging ditches. And next year it's going to be worse. The administrator's office is being redone, and Jackson has hired three or four people in addition to the deputy administrators, and one of them is a public information officer, Guilfoyle said. "How many public information officers does this government need?" he asked. "The fire department has one, but when something comes up Chief James comes to the podium. And they're talking about hiring a PIO for utilities." Guilfoyle said he wasn't consulted about the budget despite asking to be included in discussions. He also was not invited to a meeting where a decision was made to cut $700,000 from the Gold Cross ambulance contract. Neither was Mayor Hardie Davis, although he was supposed to be. "There was no discussion of cutting Gold Cross," he said. "They just went into a little meeting and took out a hatchet and started chopping. It's all under the administrator. I wasn't contacted about the budget even though I'm the finance committee chairman." ^ ...What It Is Ain't Exactly Clear: In a letter to commissioners accompanying a 200-page budget document Jackson states "the budget funds all essential services and programs despite revenue challenges." What revenue challenges could those be? "We was told the stormwater fee was going to be a cure-all," said Commissioner Marion Williams. "That was going to help us balance our budget, but I haven't seen it in the budget yet. I'm still looking. "Now we're talking about making cuts – 5 percent in fleet management. I don't see how we can make all those cuts." While some important things are being cut, the bureaucracy is growing. "We're building layers in our government," Guilfoyle said. "Even with this South Augusta Development Department, it was brought up that it should be under our government. People should pay attention to what's going on." But that's hard to do because Jackson and a favored group of commissioners make up a "very closed society" at the Marble Palace, Guilfoyle said. If you're not a part of it, you're out," he said. "The average citizens doesn't see it because they're not down there. The average person doesn't know what's going on." ^ Biting the Hands: Guilfoyle was also incensed that in Jackson's overview of the budget last week, she said traditional economic development and industrial recruitment have not enhanced property-tax collection significantly. Her examples included ADP, which was billed $69,330 in personal property and real estate taxes this year, but would have paid $346,585 without tax incentives. Starbucks was billed $211,245 in personal property and real estate taxes this year, but would have paid $1.37 million without incentives. "And for her to say on the commission floor that two large industries aren't paying enough taxes is unprofessional," Guilfoyle said. "Very unprofessional because the exemptions got approved by the commission. They provide jobs for people who live and shop in Richmond County and pay property taxes and sales taxes. ADP is doing an expansion right now. Millions and millions of dollars." ^ Section 4 – Expenditures by Department: The mayor wanted a $487,110 budget for his office next year, but the administrator recommended only $411,240, which is still a $102,290 increase. She also approved $38,750 for his "My Brothers Keeper" program, which is supposed to help young black males. President Barack Obama gets millions in donations from private corporations and businesses for his "My Brother's Keeper" initiative. I suppose the mayor could do that too, but Jackson took such a swipe at Starbucks, ADP, Keebler and Procter & Gamble about the city missing out on millions because of tax exemptions during her budget presentation, they might not be feeling so generous. Another city department that has ballooned like bureaucrats dining on government credit cards is the administrator's office. In 2014, when Jackson came on board, the office cost taxpayers $729,439, and next year the budget will be $1.04 million, which includes a $19,290 increase over this year's budget. And there was no such thing as a Compliance Department until last year when it absorbed the DBE and EEO offices whose combined budgets were $272,700.The Compliance Department's budget for next year, which includes the addition of an ADA office, is almost $600,000. And the Tax Commissioner's budget has grown from $2.83 million in 2014 to $3.42 million next year, a half-million dollar increase, or 23 times the amount Commissioner Steven Kendrick lost when he forgot to lock the safe. The Central Services Administration didn't exist in 2014 or 2015, and now it's costing $224,870. The Employee Incentive Awards program has gained a whopping $2,451 to $18,800 since 2014, which indicates incentivizing employees might not be a top incentive. ^ Section 5 – Program Enhancements, Now Personnel & Upgrades: The proposed budget will be discussed in coming weeks and final decisions on requests will be decided then. Among the many requests is the mayor's for $20,295 for employee upgrades. One would be upgraded to Executive Assistant to Communications/Policy Analyst. Another upgraded to Executive Assistant to Director of Community Outreach. They must stay up nights thinking up these titles. And what's wrong with the word "secretary"? The mayor's "My Brother's Keeper Program" would take care of one brother pretty good with a $16,793 paycheck for being a part-time executive assistant working 20 hours a week. The law department wants $176,316 for salaries for a new attorney and a paralegal who would be paid from the rain tax and the road tax, which Jackson stated the government is in a position to "accelerate." Remember that Compliance Office I mentioned earlier that didn't exist in 2014? It wants $52,621.65 for an Outreach Specialist. Human Resources wants to upgrade a Benefits Coordinator to a Benefits Supervisor for $20,732.93 and upgrade a Compensation & Benefits Manager to Assistant HR Director for $3,685.77. Maybe with these raises, they'd be able to figure out how to pay Linda Goodman, the widow of 30-year Richmond County law enforcement officer Bill Goodman, the pension they say they can't prove is due her because HR lost the paperwork. Central Services 311 wants two more people to take complaints. So maybe they'll be able to take your call the next time the garbage man skips your house. While the mayor got his Brother's Keeper Program, it appears he didn't get his $7,200 auto allowance. The tax commissioner didn't get his $3,600 auto allowance either. Traffic Engineering didn't get its $1 million for tree removal, which is pretty smart since recreation had asked for $110,000 to do a tree inventory, which they didn't get either. Only in Augusta would department heads ask to inventory trees and ask to cut them down in the same budget. At least it's not on the same page. ^ Section 8 - Commission Work Sessions, Presentations: Now doesn't that seem appropriate? Six of One. Half a Dozen of Another. Elections officials say early voting numbers being up presage high turnout in November, but not everyone thinks so. Dave Barbee, former Richmond County Republican Party chairman, said it just means fewer people will be voting on Election Day. "It will be like buying alcohol on Sunday," he said. "People used to buy it on Saturday. Now when they run out of beer Saturday night, they say, 'I'll get some more tomorrow.' They're not buying more alcohol. They're just buying it at different times."

A study of over-performing companies shows what they're doing right when it comes to insights and analytics. By Josh Kolm October 24, 2016 Integrating data into consumer-facing functions and embracing experimentation are leading to better company performance, according to recent research done as part of “Insights2020,” an initiative aimed at helping companies be more consumer-centric. Earlier this month at the ACA’s Executive Forum, Mario Simon, CEO of global consultancy Kantar Vermeer, presented a study that included more than 10,000 survey respondents and 300 qualitative interviews in 60 different markets, representing business leaders from large companies across different sectors. It found that a common factor driving growth at over-performing companies (in the top quintile of revenue performance) was leadership embracing the effort to be more customer-centric. Simon says that while he was expecting concerns around tech, big data and software to feature in the survey, most of what was brought forth was about leadership. The things that had the biggest impact on the business of over-performers could largely be divided into three categories: the external, total experience a customer has with a brand or company; the internal structures that help the company be customer-centric; and having an “insights engine” that powers both. One driver for creating a total customer experience was being purpose-led (according to 80% of over-performing companies, compared to 32% of those under-performing). Companies start by expressing that purpose in a brand communication (instead of just being functional or emotional), but the successful ones then integrate that purpose across their entire marketing mix and in all of their business functions. Another example (according to 73% of over-performers and  31% of under-performers) is creating experience based on data-driven insights. Most over-performing brands start with a broad value proposition before moving on to segmentation, then to more detailed micro-targeting and finally to one-on-one interaction and customization. Internally, the biggest driver of growth was having a customer-centric approach embraced by every function within the company (79% of over-performers, versus 13% of under-performers). Most companies have their data owned by their insights and analytics teams, but more successful ones integrate that data into their consumer-facing functions, before incorporating it into non-marketing decisions and finding ways to align it with external partners. Experimentation is another important driver but one that isn’t being embraced as much as it could be. Forty per cent of top performers and 13% of under-performers are embracing experimentation and risk, something Simon says speaks to how large companies tend to be organized. “Risk and experimentation are what these companies were designed to avoid,” he says. “Financial analysts discount companies that have erratic returns and take risks, and benefit companies that are very stable and non-risky. But in a world of disruption, we need a different mindset to compete. Unilever isn’t just competing with P&G, they’re competing with all kinds of small companies that are coming up, creating their own thing and biting at the heels.” Companies that embrace experimentation have part of their budgets allocated to experimenting and taking risks, and encourage employees to do so by making it part of their job function. Simon singled out a few key elements for developing a data “insights engine,” including having data and analytics leadership report directly to the company’s C-suite, and focusing on collecting data that can be effectively synthesized and used.

Developed in response to the demand for a more efficient and cost-effective material handling systems, Interroll’s MSC 50 is a technically and economically superior solution, and the first of its kind in the industry. The MSC 50 is easy-to-install, maintenance-free, and boasts a host of useful features that together deliver process reliability and attractive ROI. “These features make the MSC 50 the perfect choice for warehousing, e-commerce, postal service, food and pharmaceutical operations, as well as for customers that use flow racks for heavy containers,” said Ralf Garlichs, executive vice president and head of products & technology at Interroll. “Our MSC 50 is a solution with an optimum price-to-performance ratio, offering users the peace of mind that only a solid investment brings.” The MSC 50 is the most cost-effective solution currently on the market for controlling the speed of boxes and plastic trays traveling on gravity roller conveyors and spirals or the end sections of sorters. Suitable for handling goods weighing up to 77 pounds, this innovative system provides customers with total control over their conveyor and ensures lightweight packages move smoothly, while limiting the speed of heavy goods traveling along the conveyor. Gravity roller conveyors are widely used and are often installed to handle the final stage of goods moving through sorting systems. To eliminate extra costs resulting from, for example, goods damaged because they are moving too quickly on those gravity conveyors, or extra travel time to pick up stuck goods, these end sections must work perfectly. “In an effort to minimize costs, the majority of gravity conveyors currently available are sold without components to control conveyor speed, resulting in limited functionality,” said Ken Ferguson, director of sales and marketing at Interroll. “Because of an increasing diversity in the size and weight of goods running on gravity conveyors, we saw an opportunity to develop a speed controller to address this issue.” The MSC 50 features an eddy current brake, which makes it maintenance-free. Double shielding prevents magnetic emissions entirely, and due to its bidirectional braking function, the MSC 50 cannot be mounted incorrectly. In addition, the MSC 50 speed controller is easy to install and is well-suited for retrofitting existing gravity conveyor installations. Different MSC 50 lengths and quantities can be used to scale the design and provide the ideal solution for a variety of applications. The MSC 50 is designed for a maximum load of 112 lbf and a maximum infeed speed of 500 fpm. Maximum input is up to 3,000 units per hour. It has a specified ambient temperature range of 40 to 104 degrees Fahrenheit and is available in roller lengths of 8 to 55 inches. Interroll will be exhibiting at Booth E-8825 in the McCormick Place Convention Center on November 6-9. Interroll will also showcase its lineup of ultra-hygienic, energy efficient drum motors, which are the only ones in the industry with full USDA, NSF and FDA approvals for safe processing of poultry, meat and dairy. Material handling professionals from the packaging and pharmaceutical industries will also be able to learn more about Interroll’s 24 Volt platform of RollerDrive and Control Cards, which are ideal for saving energy and space while maintaining total control of the material flow. About Interroll The Interroll Group is a worldwide leading producer of high-quality key products and services for material handling. The company offers a broad product range in the four product groups “rollers,” “drives,” “conveyors & sorters” and “pallet & carton flow” to approximately 23,000 customers (system integrators and OEMs) around the world.

Technical Alert: Exxon Mobil Higher How To Lower Your Risk With High Yielding Dividend Stocks (Seeking Alpha) More than a third of the Dow Jones Industrials are on deck to report quarterly results this week. Wall Street expectations are particularly low for two supermajor oil companies. Just one of these two companies beat earnings estimates in the previous quarter. The third-quarter earnings reporting season is in full swing, and more than a third of the Dow Jones Industrial Average components have shared their latest results so far. Most of the rest of the 30 Dow members are on tap to report this week, and the Wall Street expectations are lowest for Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX), and Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE: XOM) as the sector struggles with slowly recovering oil prices. The Wall Street consensus forecasts call for earnings at both supermajors to have dropped sharply year over year, in the period when OPEC agreed to a production freeze and Exxon caught the eye of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. When Chevron shares its third-quarter results, the Wall Street forecast is that its earnings per share (EPS) will have shrunk by more than 63 percent year over year to $0.45 per share, on $29.05 billion in revenue, which would be a more than 15 percent decline. Note that this integrated energy and chemicals company bested EPS estimates in the prior two quarters. But the estimate has dropped eight cents in the past 60 days. The forecast from 23 Estimize respondents sees EPS from the California-based company coming in at $0.44. Also, the consensus revenue estimate for the three months that ended in September is $30.71 billion. However, Estimize, like Wall Street, narrowly overestimated Chevron's revenue in the previous two quarters. Related Link: This Week's Dow Earnings: High Expectations For DuPont And Visa Wall Street's consensus forecast for Exxon Mobil is for EPS to have slipped more than 33 percent from the same period of last year to $0.67, though that would be up from the $0.41 (a sizable miss) posted in the second quarter. The 60 Estimize respondents are a bit less optimistic, with an estimate of $0.64 per share for the period that ended in September. Like Wall Street, Estimize narrowly overestimated Exxon's revenue back in the previous quarter, and this time the respondents are looking for $62.23 billion, which would be more than 8 percent lower than in the year-ago period. Wall Street is in the more pessimistic one here, with its consensus forecast of $61.34 billion. Wall Street does see top-line growth in the current quarter, but a decline for the full year. Both Chevron and Exxon are scheduled to report their latest results before the opening bell on Friday. Others This Week Also this week, the consensus forecasts call for per-share earnings at Dow members Apple and Coca-Cola to be lower than a year ago as well. The EPS at Procter & Gamble are anticipated to be about the same as in the year-ago period. On the other hand, the consensus forecasts call for EPS at Boeing, Caterpillar, DuPont, Merck, 3M, United Technologies and Visa to be larger than a year ago. Only a handful of Dow components will be left to report after that, but watch for upcoming results from Cisco, Pfizer and Walt Disney.
