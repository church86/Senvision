Most Popular The Lowdown is Ad Age's weekly look at news nuggets from across the world of marketing, including trends, campaign tidbits, executive comings and goings and more. The 2016 Summer Games are over, but a new winner in Olympics advertising is being announced Wednesday. Toyota's "Stand Together" spot showing people connecting across the globe won as the top TV commercial in USA Today Sports' first Ad Meter bracket for the Olympics. More than 145,000 votes were cast in the Rio Ad Meter Bracket from Aug. 12 through Wednesday morning. In all, 32 TV spots competed to be named the top spot in the inaugural Olympics bracket-style tournament. The final round pitted Toyota against Hershey. Hershey's "Hello From Home" featuring gold medal gymnast Simone Biles (shot when she was still just a heavily-favored Olympic hopeful) came in second place. Toyota won the Olympics-focused contest with its spot from by Saatchi and Saatchi, L.A., even though the automaker won't take over as a global Olympics sponsor until next year. It had to comply with strict trademark restrictions on Olympic phrases and imagery, as Ad Age previously noted. Hershey, meanwhile, used Olympics imagery in the runner-up commercial and other marketing as it is an official Team USA sponsor. While USA Today has tracked the popularity of Super Bowl ads for 28 years, Rio marked the first time it had an Olympics Ad Meter. Adobe sponsored the Rio Ad Meter Bracket. Omnigon was the tech provider with its BracketPro product that let fans watch the commercials before voting. (And in case readers have already forgotten, the winner of this year's USA Today Super Bowl Ad Meter was Hyundai's "First Date" spot starring Kevin Hart.) With so many commercials, it's hard to declare just one winner. Procter & Gamble Co. won the Olympics – or at least its two-minute "Strong" ad from Wieden & Kennedy did – according to ratings from Ace Metrix, which runs video ads past its online panel of consumers. Specifically, the ad in the long-running "Thank You Mom" campaign, which had run online since April, won on the Ace Metrix "Breakthrough" measure, which combines scores for likeability and attention and measures ability to break through clutter, according to the firm. Dick's Sporting Goods 60-second "The Contender" from Anomaly took second (silver), while Samsung's 1:40 mashup of national anthems "The Anthem" from Leo Burnett took the bronze from the survey panelists. On an aggregate basis across all their brands and ads – the decathlon of sorts – Nike, Dick's and P&G scored best overall among Olympic video ads in Ace Metrix Breakthrough scoring. And speaking of sports, P&G's Old Spice has signed Denver Broncos linebacker Von Miller to join the line of football player/pitchmen that includes Isaiah Mustafa and Terry Crews as an Old Spice guy. Mr. Miller, who was Most Valuable Player in Denver's Super Bowl 50 victory in February, will be the face of the 2016 NFL campaign for Old Spice. Football season also means more ad work for retired gridiron stars, like Howie Long. The hall of famer and Fox football analyst provides the voice-over for a new ad for the American Freedom Foundation, a support and advocacy group for veterans. The video by WPP's Cavalry aims to educate employers about how the skills that military veterans have translate into the civilian working world. Meanwhile, Jon Gruden is promoting Hooters as a place for what might be unexpected fantasy football draft parties -- women's leagues. The chain is promoting itself as a place for women to host drafts. A commercial shows a woman who seems to be confiding to her girlfriends about which date to choose: Tom or Aaron. She's actually talking about draft choices, and a Hooters Girl and Mr. Gruden help with her pick. Morrison, Hooters' ad agency of record, worked with the Atlanta division of the 4A's training program for junior talent to come up with the idea. Along with research that shows more women are watching professional football, Hooters cites data from the Fantasy Sports Trade Association that shows one-third of fantasy football managers last year were women. In music news, fans bummed to miss Joe Jonas and rock band DNCE perform on Friday as part of the Citi Concert Series on NBC's "Today Show" can quit complaining and put on a VR headset. For the first time, Citi, which began sponsoring the concert series late last year, is offering its concert in virtual reality. The bank will be doling out 7,000 branded Google cardboard headsets to Citi cardmembers and NBC fan pass subscribers ahead of the event, and also providing 3,000 sets to in-person attendees at Rockefeller Plaza who may want to access post-show content. "We want to push the boundaries of the very meaning of access beyond attendance and as technology evolves, it's allowing us to do so," Jennifer Breithaupt, managing director, media, advertising and global entertainment, at Citi, said in a statement. Indeed, VR is one of marketing's hottest trends; Forrester Research predicts that 52 million units of headsets will be in use by 2020. General Mills is being taken over by bunnies. First, the maker of Trix cereal held a rabbit showdown, in which people submitted videos of their furry friends' stunts. Submissions ended on Aug. 19, but you can watch the videos here. The day voting ended, its Annie's brand rolled out a digital brand campaign, "Organic for Everybunny," to show how the organic food brand will be popping up in new parts of the grocery store as it expands in categories such as cereal, granola bars, soup and yogurt --- all areas where General Mills has a strong conventional presence. The digital spots feature live bunnies in the store. Annie's President John Foraker said the brand is "putting a stake in the ground and making organic more accessible for more people in the U.S." The campaign, said to be Annie's biggest campaign spending to-date, comes from The BellShop. To celebrate the launch of Prego Farmers' Market sauce varieties, the brand installed a giant mason-style jar greenhouse at Chelsea Plaza in New York on August 17, 2016. Credit: Nathan Perkel In other food news, Campbell Soup's Prego brand set up a unique spin on a mason jar to show off a new line of sauces sold in, you guessed it, mason jars. A one-day farm in a jar display in Chelsea Plaza in New York on Aug. 17 promoted Prego Farmers' Market, a sauce line made with tomatoes, herbs, and vegetables. The 450-square foot space was redone with a farm vibe, complete with hay and a tractor, and the chance to pick tomatoes. About 3,000 people were said to visit the spot during the one-day pop up. Agencies working with the brand include Zeno Group, Anomaly, MEC, RND Studios and Shaw & Co. Productions. Contributing: Jessica Wohl, Jack Neff, Adrianne Pasquarelli, E.J.

By Josh Kolm August 24, 2016 Toronto-based innovation and research agency The Idea Suite has bolstered the CPG and shopper marketing experience on its team, hiring former P&G marketer Alexandra Glover as director of innovation. Prior to joining the agency last month, Glover had been with P&G for over 10 years, most recently as brand category leader for its oral care products, a role she took in April 2015. She also spent four years in leadership roles on the teams leading shopper marketing programs at Costco, Target and Shoppers Drug Mart. She began with P&G in brand manager roles for its oral care and female shave categories. “We’re thrilled to welcome Alex to the team and benefit from her vast experience in commercial and retail innovation, both of which are becoming key areas of focus for our Canadian clients,” said Fiona Stevenson, co-president and founding partner at The Idea Suite, in a press release. Stevenson is also a P&G veteran. The Idea Suite, founded at the beginning of 2015 by Stevenson and co-president Shelli Baltman, focuses on using qualitative consumer and shopper research methods to develop and design innovation strategy and programs, including new products, services, brands and marketing concepts. Over the past 18 months, clients have included Mondelez, McDonald’s, Clover Leaf, Molson Coors, Catelli, Nestlé Foods and CIBC. Also on the innovation front, the agency hired Jenna Valera as innovation manager earlier this year. Glover and Valera have joined a small roster of permanent employees that is rounded out with freelance designers, brand consultants, researchers and social media experts.

The company found sales of the product rose when its marketing campaign was broadened, after it stagnated when it was limited to target groups.

Facebook Inc. has spent years developing its ability to zero in on consumers based on demographics, shopping habits and life milestones. P&G, the maker of myriad household goods including Tide and Pampers, initially jumped at the opportunity to market directly to subsets of shoppers, from teenage shavers to first-time homeowners. Marc Pritchard, P&G’s chief marketing officer, said the company has realized it took the strategy too far. “We targeted too much, and we went too narrow,” he said in an interview, “and now we’re looking at: What is the best way to get the most reach but also the right precision?” Mr. Pritchard said P&G won’t cut back on Facebook spending and will employ targeted ads where it makes sense, such as pitching diapers to expectant mothers. He said P&G has ramped up spending both on digital sites and traditional platforms. One category the company is scaling back: smaller websites that lack the reach of sites such as Facebook, Google and YouTube. On a broader scale, P&G’s shift highlights the limits of such targeting for big brands, one of the cornerstones of Facebook’s ad business. The social network is able to command higher prices for its targeted marketing; the narrower the targeting the more expensive the ad. Related Coverage Retailers Dominate List of Popular Holiday Ads Nov. 23, 2016 Forbes Takes a Page From Snapchat Nov. 22, 2016 BuzzFeed, NBCUniversal to Intertwine Ad Sales and Production Nov. 22, 2016 Mobile Ad Targeting Is Improving, According to Nielsen Nov. 22, 2016 P&G could be the bellwether on how consumer goods companies and big brands use digital advertising. Over the past year some marketers, specifically consumer product companies, have discovered they need to go “much more broad” with their advertising on social media sites such as Facebook, said James Douglas, executive director of social-media agency Society, which is owned by Interpublic Group. Mr. Douglas said case studies show that companies can receive a bigger sales increase if they reach a more significant portion of a platform’s overall audience. For instance, P&G two years ago tried targeting ads for its Febreze air freshener at pet owners and households with large families. The brand found that sales stagnated during the effort, but they rose when the campaign on Facebook and elsewhere was expanded last March to include anyone over 18. A Facebook spokeswoman said its partnership with P&G “grows every year” and the two companies learn from one another. “That has always been the spirit of how we work together and challenge one another,” she said. Facebook started working on a targeted ad system in 2007, when it was an unprofitable three-year-old startup with less than 60 million active users. At the time, its main marketing platform was free Facebook pages through which companies promoted their products. ENLARGE Facebook has since emerged as a marketing platform of singular scale. Last year, Facebook raked in $17.08 billion in ad revenue, up 49% year over year, as advertisers sought the attention of its 1.7 billion monthly active users. Advertisers can pinpoint their target audience precisely. Political candidates can focus on users in congressional districts, restaurant chains can run campaigns to spicy food lovers, and moving companies can find users who are “very likely” to move to another home. “If you could run an ad and reach a million people or run a targeted ad to reach 5,000, you have to have pretty impressive returns on that 5,000 to make it worth it,” said Peter Daboll, chief executive of Ace Metrix, which tests ads for effectiveness and works with Facebook. Cincinnati-based P&G spent roughly $7.2 billion on advertising globally in the year that ended in June, up about 1% from the previous year, according to company filings. P&G said it plans to increase it around 5% for the year that started July 1. Prior to last year’s increase, the company cut spending two years in a row. P&G’s push to find broader reach with its advertising is also evident in the company’s recent increases in television spending. Toward the end of last year P&G began shifting money back into television, according to people familiar with the matter. During the first quarter of 2016, the company’s ad spending jumped 11% to $429 million from the year earlier, Kantar Media said. For many of the largest advertisers in the world, the precise targeting tools touted by Facebook are less of a draw, said Pivotal Research analyst Brian Weiser. “The bigger your brand, the more you need broad reach and less targeted media,” he said. Targeting is paramount for advertisers trying to get users to download a game app or a small business trying to appeal to local customers. Facebook has started offering new tools specifically for large advertisers, including a way to boost brand awareness by showing ads to people who are more likely to pay attention to them. On Tuesday, it introduced changes that make it harder for people to block ads from appearing on its desktop website. “The cornerstone of our ad strategy is a mix of mass reach and personalized targeting that lends well to mobile consumption and is a strong complement to TV,” the Facebook spokeswoman said. Not all big advertisers are pulling back on Facebook’s targeted marketing. Priceline Group Inc. said it expects lower returns in the current quarter from bookings generated from its advertising, much of which goes through Alphabet Inc.’s Google. As a result the travel company plans to increase spending on Facebook’s targeted ads. “We found that a number of things we’ve done on Facebook works well,” Chief Executive Jeffery Boyd said. “We would like to spend more money on Facebook going forward.” Corrections & Amplifications: The correct name of the CEO of Priceline Group Inc. is Jeffery Boyd. An earlier version of this article misstated his name. (Aug. 17) — Suzanne Vranica contributed to this article.

Led by Simone Biles and Katie Ledecky, they won 61 medals, enough to put them at the top of the overall standings, behind China and Great Britain, and more than 25 million Americans turned on their televisions every night to watch them do it.      PHOTO 1 2 3 4 5 Simone Manuel -- REUTERS 1 2 3 4 5 Katie Ledecky -- AFP 1 2 3 4 5 Claressa Maria Shields -- AFP 1 2 3 4 5 Alex Morgan -- REUTERS 1 2 3 4 5 Simone Biles -- REUTERS    RELATED STORIES The Good Fight: Justin Bartha joins The Good Wife spin-off Gilmore Girls star Scott Patterson on ‘chemistry’ with Lauren Graham, biggest revival ‘regret’ HBO renews Westworld, Divorce, and Insecure Cash Cab Season 2 features celebrities Goodbye Russell, Vaughn, and Cohen Sponsors also paid dearly to reach that audience -- which, like Team USA’s medal-winners, skews female -- and NBC said it will make a profit on these games. American women’s ability to win and willingness to watch is a singularity in big-time sports. The same audience doesn’t tune in for non-Olympic sports, in spite of the major leagues’ best efforts. Women’s professional sports in the US continue to struggle. And the Olympic athletes who capture the nation’s attention during the games have a small fraction of the financial opportunities that accrue to male sports stars. The Olympics work for women -- and for sponsors, such as Procter & Gamble Co., who are eager to reach them -- for a lot of reasons that are hard to replicate. Prime-time network television caters to women in general, and the Olympics’ emphasis on pageantry and personality creates good, competitive drama. Add the patriotism of global competition on a four-year cycle, said Neal Pilson, who ran CBS Sports for almost two decades, and you’ve got appointment television. “The sports that are in the Olympics, they’re not being watched because they’re sports, they’re being watched because they’re for flag, for country, for young athletes who strive for four years -- you know the stories,” Pilson said. Women made up 55% of the audience for the Rio 2016 Games, a proportion that, according to NBC, has been steady for two decades. The Winter Olympics chart even better with women, because figure skating is so popular. Men and women haven’t watched the Olympics in equal proportions since 1992, according to data from NBC. It’s an attractive demographic, and companies tailor their advertising accordingly. Procter & Gamble came up with the “Proud Sponsor of Mom” campaign ahead of the games. Visa, Inc. made one ad that featured athletes car-pooling to Rio de Janeiro and another that starred married Olympians Ashton Eaton and Brianne Thiesen-Eaton in mock domestic competition. “There’s a logic to all this,” Pilson said. “Not only will women watch certain programming, but if American athletes are doing well, more women will watch. Very smart people spend a huge amount of money based on this premise.” Even though women have made up more than half the viewing audience for decades, Olympics television programming didn’t favor female athletes until recently. Women received more than half the airtime for the first time during NBC’s broadcast of the London 2012 Olympics. This summer, women were featured 60% of the time. “We take great pride in knowing that no one devotes more broadcast network prime time coverage to women’s sports,” said Jim Bell, executive producer of NBC Olympics, in an e-mail. “Our goal is always the same: Show the most compelling television.” Winning is appealing, so NBC may simply be following the medals. The success in women’s sports is a testament to Title IX, which radically improved the infrastructure for female athletes, and the incentives -- college scholarship, anyone? -- to succeed. “It doesn’t surprise me that we would be dominant globally. We’re a well-resourced country with a big population, and we’ve made women’s sports a priority,” said Val Ackerman, commissioner of the Big East conference. In victory, Team USA’s women gave NBC the kinds of historic moments and emotional storylines for which Olympic telecasts are famous. Biles established herself as one of the best gymnasts in history; Ledecky set two world records en route to four golds and one silver medal, the best performance by an American woman in a single Olympics. Simone Manuel became the first African-American to win a gold medal in an individual swimming event. Sarah Robles won America’s first medal in weightlifting in 16 years, Claressa Shields was the first American to defend a medal in boxing and Allyson Felix became the most-decorated female track-and-field athlete in US Olympic history. The same kind of storytelling doesn’t translate to long league seasons, either for women’s sports or men’s. In the major leagues, stars are celebrities and often multimillionaires, with careers that don’t lend themselves to the Olympic-style mini-biopic. If marketers really want to reach women, they have to get more creative, said Amy Trask, former chief executive officer of the Oakland Raiders and author of the new book, You Negotiate Like a Girl. “More sophisticated and sensible strategies are needed than ‘shrink it and pink it,’” she said. The majority of money in professional sports is made by selling broadcast rights, and while the US women’s soccer team has sold out exhibition games, there’s been little audience for women’s sports on television. Women don’t tend to watch TV when sports are on -- during the day on weekends. In prime-time, research suggests women gravitate toward entertainment over sports. This creates a chicken-or-egg problem. Outside the Olympics, the biggest sponsors largely ignore female athletes. But without investment, it’s hard to create a critical mass of fans. Companies are missing a chance to stand out, said Dominic Curran, CEO of sports marketing agency Synergy. “More brands should be looking at the opportunity in women’s sport,” he said. “People have to take the plunge, not based on the numbers but around the opportunity to talk to what is potentially a huge audience.” -- Bloomberg E-mail | Print |     From / email :     To :     E-mail (required) :     Message :     Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.    MORE STORIES Kampai: The Japanese make wine Potatoes are not the enemy 300 years of history in one meal The return of a little princess These 10 paintings just sold for $378.75 million Joining in the journey of struggling artists Art&Culture (11/23/16) Ariana Grande wins top American Music award Independent films dominate this year’s MMFF The Good Fight: Justin Bartha joins The Good Wife spin-off    MOST READ    MOST E-MAILED 1.

Wednesday November 23, 2016 Analysis Argentina Community Economy World Culture Media Sports English on the Side   Patriotism on a four-year cycle Wednesday, August 24, 2016 Olympics are the unicorn of sports TV More than 25 million people watched Simone Biles and other female athletes on television at Rio 2016. By Janet Paskin Bloomberg Women made up 55 percent of the viewing audience for the Rio 2016 Games WASHINGTON — The 2016 Summer Olympics are over, and the women of Team USA won by a landslide. Led by Simone Biles and Katie Ledecky, they won 61 medals, enough to put them at the top of the overall standings, behind Great Britain and China, and more than 25 million people in the US turned on their televisions every night to watch them do it. Sponsors also paid dearly to reach that audience-which, like Team USA’s medal-winners, skews female-and NBC said it will make a profit on these games. US women’s ability to win and willingness to watch is a singularity in big-time sports. The same audience doesn’t tune in for non-Olympic sports, in spite of the major leagues’ best efforts. Women’s professional sports in the US continue to struggle. And the Olympic athletes who capture the nation’s attention during the games have a small fraction of the financial opportunities that accrue to male sports stars. The Olympics work for women-and for sponsors, such as Procter & Gamble Co., who are eager to reach them — for a lot of reasons that are hard to replicate. Prime-time network television caters to women in general, and the Olympics’ emphasis on pageantry and personality creates good, competitive drama. Add the patriotism of global competition on a four-year cycle, said Neal Pilson, who ran CBS Sports for almost two decades, and you’ve got appointment television. “The sports that are in the Olympics, they’re not being watched because they’re sports, they’re being watched because they’re for flag, for country, for young athletes who strive for four years — you know the stories,” Pilson said. Women made up 55 percent of the audience for the Rio 2016 Games, a proportion that, according to NBC, has been steady for two decades. The Winter Olympics chart even better with women, because figure skating is so popular. Men and women haven’t watched the Olympics in equal proportions since 1992, according to data from NBC. It’s an attractive demographic, and companies tailor their advertising accordingly. Procter & Gamble came up with the “Proud Sponsor of Mom” campaign ahead of the games.

P&G sues another razor manufacturer Brett Milam , bmilam@enquirer.com 1:20 p.m. EDT August 24, 2016 Procter & Gamble logo (Photo: Provided/P&G) Procter & Gamble filed a lawsuit Tuesday against one of its rivals, Edgewell Personal Care Co., claiming it falsely advertised one of its Schick razors as equal to or better than Gillette's Mach3 razors. The suit filed in U.S. District Court in New York City accuses Schick razors of patent infringement, unfair competition and false advertising against Gillette. Since 1998, when the Mach3 razor was introduced, sales have exceeded $5 billion, P&G claims in the complaint. Schick PL launched in June and the company, according to the complaint, claimed its blades can fit a Gillette Mach3 and that they include a gel to reduce irritation. Also in June, Gillette conducted blind testing on a group of males aged 18-55 comparing the shave provided by the Schick PL and the Mach3, the complaint said. "The results show that Schick PL creates a statistically significant number of greater nicks and cuts than Mach3," the complaint said. The complaint claimed the patent for the Mach3 expired on April 10, and to conceivably roll out the Schick PL by June, Edgewell would, "by necessity, have manufactured, imported, used and/or offered Schick PL for sale in the United States prior to patent expiration." In December 2015, Procter & Gamble sued Dollar Shave Club, claiming the digital startup was using its patented Gillette technology. That suit also involved the Mach3, specifically, an overcoat of chromium that keeps the blade sharper longer, which Dollar Shave Club was selling razors with such technology, the complained claimed. Dollar Shave Club filed a counter-claim against Procter & Gamble, saying it did not infringe on the patent. The case is still making its way through the court system. CINCINNATI.COM P&G sues razor rival P&G alleges that Edgewell has caused Gillette "irreparable injury." "Edgewell's actions threaten harm to Gillette's reputation and that of Mach3, thus jeopardizing Gillette's hard-earned standing and market share," the complaint said. The complaint stated that P&G is seeking corrective advertising, all profits and gains from this "unlawful conduct" and damages from Edgewell for patent infringement.

X Geneva set to cut corporate tax rate by more than 10% Swiss canton faces ‘mother of all battles’ over plan to cut tax rate to 13.49 per cent Thu, Aug 25, 2016, 15:39 A rate of 13 per cent would leave Geneva with the third most attractive corporate tax system in Switzerland. Photograph: iStock         When the European Union pressured Switzerland to scrap tax breaks for foreign companies, Geneva had most to lose. Now, the canton that is home to almost 1,000 multinationals is set to use tax to burnish its appeal. Geneva will on August 30th propose cutting its corporate tax rate to 13.49 per cent from 24.2 per cent, according to sources. For an interim period of five years, the rate will be a slightly higher 13.79 per cent, the sources said. While that’s 2.2 percentage points higher than the average preferential rate currently offered to many foreign firms, the new regime will improve the Swiss city’s competitive position, according to Credit Suisse Group. “I could see Geneva going up very high in the ranks,” said Thierry Boitelle, a lawyer at Bonnard Lawson in the city. “International companies will be glad to have some certainty when the new rate is finally implemented.” Like the rest of Switzerland, Geneva has been buffeted by the strong Swiss franc and concern over immigration quotas, while the demise of banking secrecy has hurt the city’s financial industry. The stakes are high for the politicians contemplating a tax rate to underpin the French-speaking canton’s allure: multinationals from Procter and Gamble to commodity trader Mercuria Energy Group account for 76,000 jobs and 40 per cent of the economy. “It’s the mother of all battles for us,” says Vincent Subilia, deputy director of international affairs and arbitration at the Geneva Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Services. “We can’t afford to lose it because the attractiveness of Geneva and the shape that our economy will take for generations to come are at risk here.” Opportunity A rate of about 13 per cent would see Geneva jump 13 places to become the third-most attractive of Switzerland’s 26 cantons, trailing only Zug and Zurich, according to a study by Credit Suisse. ADVERTISEMENT “Geneva and the western part of Switzerland will be even more attractive for firms, especially compared to France,” said Thomas Ruehl, head of regional research at Credit Suisse. “We see the corporate tax reform as a big opportunity for Geneva.” France, which borders the canton to the south, east and west, has a tax rate of 33.33 per cent, according to figures published by KPMG. Within Europe, Geneva’s rate would exceed only a number of smaller economies such as our own 12.5 per cent and Montenegro, which has the region’s lowest rate of 9 per cent. That will mean Geneva competes with Ireland, the Netherlands and the UK as a low-tax jurisdiction, while it may also provide Zurich with stiffer competition for Swiss corporates, said Mr Boitelle. Still, tax alone won’t be enough to turn Geneva’s fortunes around, according to the lawyer, who highlights the need for Switzerland to resolve the issues caused by voters backing a referendum in 2014 to introduce quotas for EU migrants. “Tax reform won’t change that,” said Mr Boitelle. “Geneva’s appeal lies in a good business culture, plus quality of life, a well-educated workforce and stability. They need to come up with some kind of solution for the immigration issue.” Hole in finances The new taxation regime will also leave a projected 459 million franc (€420 million) hole in Geneva’s finances, according to some estimates. The shortfall is likely to be something close to that, said Roland Godel, a Geneva finance department spokesman, who declined to comment further on the reform before next week’s announcement. “The real challenge will be on the budget side,” said Elias Hafner, an economist at UBS Group, adding that Geneva’s higher ratio of public officials to residents than other parts of Switzerland provided scope for cuts.That’s a concern for Romain de Sainte Marie, head of the Socialist Party in Geneva’s cantonal parliament. “We need an attractive tax rate and we do want to retain most jobs in Geneva, but we must also guarantee the same level of public service,” said Mr de Sainte Marie. “For Geneva’s attractiveness, the quality of public services is just as important as the corporate tax rate.” Opposition to the new rate from left-leaning political parties will probably trigger a referendum as it would require only 500 signatures. In a March plebiscite in the neighbouring canton of Vaud, 87.1 per cent of voters backed cutting the corporate tax rate to 13.79 per cent from 21.65 per cent. That change will probably mean fewer resources to spend on theatres, museums, street-cleaning and creches in the canton’s main city, Lausanne, according to municipal councillor Florence Germond.Failure to agree on a competitive tax rate in Geneva could result in an exodus of multinationals, cutting cantonal revenue by an even greater margin, said Denis Berdoz, a partner at Baker and McKenzie in Geneva, who specialises in tax and corporate law. “They don’t really have a choice,” said Mr Berdoz. “If the companies leave, the loss could be much higher.”       Topics: Eu Mercuria Energy Group Procter and Gamble Genève Lausanne Switzerland Zug Zürich Read More US criticises Commission's stance as Apple tax ruling looms Cliff Taylor: US sets down big marker in European tax battle Talks on new US/Ireland tax treaty to focus on multinationals Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Commercial Property Solicitor entitled to damages in Anglo case Technology Clever cube makes for easier shared viewing English Soccer Ex-England player David White reveals sexual abuse by coach Economy Downbeat Philip Hammond offers little to soothe economic fears Sponsored A bank-beating foreign exchange proposition How ‘nudge theory’ can improve pension provision Black Friday: what is it and how to prepare for it Send an AdMailer Christmas card and help a homeless charity ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Latest Business Renovated Bewley’s Cafe can seat 500 customers at a time 19:39 Lidl and Aldi to hold prices in Republic despite sterling slide 19:27 Downbeat Philip Hammond offers little to soothe economic fears 18:55 European shares steady as metal prices rise 18:53 WRC asks Cityjet pilots to defer strike 18:11 ADVERTISEMENT Most Read in Business 1 First-time buyer deposits cut to 10% as Central Bank eases mortgage rules 2 Renovated Bewley’s Cafe can seat 500 customers at a time 3 Central Bank mortgage rule change: What it means for you 4 What to do in your 20s/30s...if you don’t want to be broke in your 60s 5 Solicitor entitled to damages in Anglo case 6 Lidl and Aldi to hold prices in Republic despite sterling slide 7 Shocking revelations at Rush Credit Union are just the start 8 Thousands affected as RaboDirect axes investment funds 9 Supermac’s goes large as profits double 10 Loosening of mortgage rules will push up house prices, says Davy Never miss a story.

They need to come up with some kind of solution for the immigration issue.” Hole in finances The new taxation regime will also leave a projected 459 million franc (€420 million) hole in Geneva’s finances, according to some estimates. The shortfall is likely to be something close to that, said Roland Godel, a Geneva finance department spokesman, who declined to comment further on the reform before next week’s announcement. “The real challenge will be on the budget side,” said Elias Hafner, an economist at UBS Group, adding that Geneva’s higher ratio of public officials to residents than other parts of Switzerland provided scope for cuts.That’s a concern for Romain de Sainte Marie, head of the Socialist Party in Geneva’s cantonal parliament. “We need an attractive tax rate and we do want to retain most jobs in Geneva, but we must also guarantee the same level of public service,” said Mr de Sainte Marie. “For Geneva’s attractiveness, the quality of public services is just as important as the corporate tax rate.” Opposition to the new rate from left-leaning political parties will probably trigger a referendum as it would require only 500 signatures. In a March plebiscite in the neighbouring canton of Vaud, 87.1 per cent of voters backed cutting the corporate tax rate to 13.79 per cent from 21.65 per cent. That change will probably mean fewer resources to spend on theatres, museums, street-cleaning and creches in the canton’s main city, Lausanne, according to municipal councillor Florence Germond.Failure to agree on a competitive tax rate in Geneva could result in an exodus of multinationals, cutting cantonal revenue by an even greater margin, said Denis Berdoz, a partner at Baker and McKenzie in Geneva, who specialises in tax and corporate law. “They don’t really have a choice,” said Mr Berdoz. “If the companies leave, the loss could be much higher.”       Topics: Eu Mercuria Energy Group Procter and Gamble Genève Lausanne Switzerland Zug Zürich Read More US criticises Commission's stance as Apple tax ruling looms Cliff Taylor: US sets down big marker in European tax battle Talks on new US/Ireland tax treaty to focus on multinationals Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Commercial Property Solicitor entitled to damages in Anglo case Technology Clever cube makes for easier shared viewing English Soccer Ex-England player David White reveals sexual abuse by coach Economy Downbeat Philip Hammond offers little to soothe economic fears Sponsored A bank-beating foreign exchange proposition How ‘nudge theory’ can improve pension provision Black Friday: what is it and how to prepare for it Send an AdMailer Christmas card and help a homeless charity ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Latest Business Renovated Bewley’s Cafe can seat 500 customers at a time 19:39 Lidl and Aldi to hold prices in Republic despite sterling slide 19:27 Downbeat Philip Hammond offers little to soothe economic fears 18:55 European shares steady as metal prices rise 18:53 WRC asks Cityjet pilots to defer strike 18:11 ADVERTISEMENT Most Read in Business 1 First-time buyer deposits cut to 10% as Central Bank eases mortgage rules 2 Renovated Bewley’s Cafe can seat 500 customers at a time 3 Central Bank mortgage rule change: What it means for you 4 What to do in your 20s/30s...if you don’t want to be broke in your 60s 5 Solicitor entitled to damages in Anglo case 6 Lidl and Aldi to hold prices in Republic despite sterling slide 7 Shocking revelations at Rush Credit Union are just the start 8 Thousands affected as RaboDirect axes investment funds 9 Supermac’s goes large as profits double 10 Loosening of mortgage rules will push up house prices, says Davy Never miss a story.

Yesterday's Island/Today's Nantucket News and Events for Nantucket Island Navigation Nantucket.net Nantucket Restaurants Nantucket Lodging Photo Contest Events Contact A Look Back … Folger Brothers: Not Just Coffee August 25, 2016 | Filed under: Nantucket History & People and tagged with: coffee, Henry Clay Folger, history ~ by Amy Jenness ~ Henry Clay Folger In 1849 three Folger brothers left Nantucket for the gold fields of northern California. By April of 1850 Edward Folger, age 20, Henry Folger, age 16 and James Folger, age 14, had reached the west coast of Panama after a ship voyage, rafting trip and a hike across the tip of the country. They left Panama City onboard the Pacific mail steamer Isthmus. When the brothers reached San Francisco there was only enough money for two to continue on to the mining camps. The youngest, J.A., as he was called, stayed in the city to work for his travel costs so he could join his brothers. Folger met 27-year-old entrepreneur William H. Bovee, who planned to build a mill in San Francisco and hired Folger. Bovee named his business The Pioneer Steam Coffee and Spice Mills. In a new twist for consumers used to roasting and grinding their own coffee beans, Bovee offered ready-to-brew prepackaged coffee. James saved enough money working for Pioneer Steam Coffee and Spice Mills to be able to join his brothers. When he left the city, Folger agreed to act as a Pioneer sales representative to stores catering to the miners. He gave out samples to store owners and relayed their orders to Bovee. James returned to San Francisco in 1865 and became a full partner in The Pioneer Steam Coffee and Spice Mills. In 1872, he bought out his partners and renamed the company J.A. Folger & Co. Eventually James’ brothers Edward and Henry tired of mining for gold. Edward established a San Francisco whaling business next to the Pioneer Steam Coffee and Spice Mill and died at age 40 in Nevada from injuries sustained in a stagecoach accident. Henry returned to Nantucket and later married Eliza Jane Clark. They settled in New York City and had eight children. Among the three brothers’ children, two Folger sons would acquire great wealth building dynasties that still exist today. In June of 1889, at age 51, JA died of a heart condition. His oldest son, James A. Folger, II, age 26, had worked in the company for seven years and succeeded his father as president of J.A. Folger & Co. James II expanded the company, which sold coffee on both a wholesale and retail basis. 1898 Folgers Ad In 1901 the company’s ambitious salesman Frank P. Atha further expanded its territory into Texas. Folger’s Coffee remained under family control until 1963, when the Procter & Gamble Company of Cincinnati, OH, acquired it and began to distribute Folger’s Coffee nationally In 1969 James Folger II’s granddaughter, Abigail Folger was murdered by followers of Charles Manson. Folger Coffee changed hands once more in 2008 when the JM Smucker Company purchased it. Henry Clay Folger, Jr., born in 1857, was Henry, Sr and Eliza Jane’s oldest child. His father had not been a successful businessman, so when Henry, Jr. attended Amherst College, he paid his tuition by competing in essay contests and by borrowing the money. While at Amherst, Folger was a Phi Beta Kappa scholar who studied Latin, Greek, French German and English literature. Folger continued on to Columbia Law School. And after passing the bar exam, he went to work at the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey as a statistical clerk in 1881. His prowess at mathematics and his methodical tracking of the company’s oil production attracted the admiration of his employer. He was chairman of the manufacturing committee by 1899, and became a trusted confidante to John D. Rockefeller. Folger and Rockefeller resisted the anti-trust movement favored by President Theodore Roosevelt. But in 1911 a US Supreme Court ruling broke up the company and Folger became president of the Standard Oil Company of New York. By that time Folger was a wealthy man and a significant shareholder at Standard Oil and its subsidiaries. He retired as president in 1923, but stayed at Standard Oil another five years as the company’s first chairman of the board. Folger and his wife, Emily, a Vassar graduate and Shakespeare scholar, used their great wealth to collect Shakespearean documents and by the time he died Henry had amassed the largest collection of first folio editions of Shakespearean plays. The couple had no children and committed their energy and a considerable amount of money to building their collection. The pair never discussed their holdings publicly and did not give scholars access to it. But privately they struggled with how best to care for their rare books and manuscripts. In the end, the couple built a library intended as a gift to the American people. They looked at sites in the United States and England, they even considered building their library on Nantucket. But finally settled on Washington, D.C. near the close of World War I. It took Henry nine years to purchase a city block worth of row houses between First and Second Streets. Folger immersed himself the library’s design and in 1930 helped lay a cornerstone of what would be the Folger Shakespeare Library. But he died that year after undergoing surgery. Folger left the majority of his wealth in a trust for the library and named Amherst College the trust’s administrator. The library opened in 1932 on April 23, the date believed to be William Shakespeare’s birthday. Today the Folger Shakespeare Library is considered the most important repository of material related to William Shakespeare. It holds more than 275,000 books about the playwright as well as playbills, costumes, furniture and paintings. Holdings also include 82 First Folios, the first edition of the “complete works” of Shakespeare, compiled in 1623 by two of Shakespeare’s actor friends.

News Business Business News The ‘ethical’ investment funds pumping millions into oil firms and big tobacco Companies backed by the multi-billion dollar funds include Exxon Mobil which has been accused of hiding climate change science and British American Tobacco, Europes largest cigarette maker Camila Russo Thursday 25 August 2016 09:28 BST Click to follow The Independent Online Funds are putting investors cash into companies such as BP and Exxon which have questionable ethics records Reuters Thinking of putting your money into a fund that describes itself as ethical? You’d better read the fine print if backing Exxon Mobil and British American Tobacco isn’t your idea of doing good. The oil company accused of misleading investors by hiding evidence about climate change and Europe’s biggest cigarette maker are among the holdings of some of the 30 biggest funds that invest following environmental or social governance guidelines, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. While some funds are strict about supporting only clean-energy producers, others buy securities from Big Oil to Big Tobacco along with consumer brands such as Unilever and Facebook. The wide range of holdings is the result of each institution deciding on its own what meets the ethical threshold.  Read more Oil companies spent £81m 'obstructing' climate laws, NGO says Loosening that definition has helped ethical investing grow about 80 per cent over the past five years to $223 billion, data compiled by Bloomberg show. “The industry hasn’t done itself many favors in making sure people understand what’s what,” said Charlie Thomas, who manages €950 million under Jupiter’s Ecology funds, which exclude oil and tobacco in favour of companies that have a solution for environmental issues.  “The challenge that we have as a sector is to be very clear with the investor so they know what they’re actually buying. Not all ethical funds are the same.” Read more Imperial Tobacco and British American Tobacco linked to child labour in Indonesia British American Tobacco accused of corporate espionage in South Africa British American Tobacco: Members of US Congress call for investigation into tobacco giant BP signed contracts with Unaoil after it was linked to bribery scandal, Panama Papers reveal BP drops legal fight against paying $1bn in oil spill damages to Gulf coast fishermen Edinburgh University ‘to take disciplinary action’ against ethical investment protesters There’s no agreed definition on what an ethical fund should be. That has allowed to mushroom the number of funds saying they support companies guided by standards on environmental and social governance. There are no set criteria for how companies report performance on those metrics, and no regulator lhas set out rules.  The looseness of the system is a concern to the G20 nations, which asked a panel led by Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England to draw up a proposal for voluntary reporting standards that companies could follow if they chose.  Ethical investing has grown into a $223 billion dollar business (Bloomberg) That’s likely to offer best practices to companies and accounting firms that draw up sustainability reports and release data through organizations such as the non-profit CDP and Bloomberg. Ethical, Social and Governance (ESG) fund strategies range from excluding only companies they score the worst in their industries on specific metrics to including only the best of their class. Some seek to spur change by working as activist shareholders. A few will invest only in companies that benefit the environment. The only way to tell the difference is to look at what the fund is holding. No Simple Label “There’s not a simple label you can slap on it to solve the problem,” said Greg Elders, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence in London tracking ESG data. “Clients think it’s a shortcut for seeing how sustainable a fund is.” The Bloomberg survey found the number of environmentally friendly or ESG funds has more than doubled in the past decade to about 730. Of the top 30, at least six hold oil companies. At Impax Asset Management Group, which runs a $568 million Environmental Markets fund, the number of companies that meet its rules has jumped to 1,500 from 250 in 1999, with the pool of firms eligible to be included growing to $4.1 trillion, according to Jon Forster, a portfolio manager at the firm. Investors have benefited from the diversification of green funds. The main ethical investing index, the MSCI KLD 400 Social Index, has risen more than 225 per cent from the March 2009 low, about as much as the S&P 500. The gauge includes 400 companies, with Microsoft, Procter & Gamble and Verizon having the biggest weightings.

Despite the minimal sentences, the ruling was described by Deltour’s lawyer as “shocking” and “a terrible anomaly.” The ruling “puts on guard future whistle-blowers,” Deltour told reporters.The LuxLeaks revelations sped beyond Luxembourg, causing European Union regulators to expand a tax-subsidy probe and propose new laws to fight corporate tax dodging, while EU lawmakers created a special committee to probe fiscal deals across the 28-nation bloc. reuters 6/17 Goldman Sachs dealmakers lavished Libyan officials with prostitutes to win contract - June 2016 A former Goldman Sachs dealmaker trying to persuade Gadaffi-era Libya to invest $1 billion with the investment bank procured prostitutes and invited Libyan officials to lavish parties in the hope of winning the business, the High Court heard on Monday June 13.The Libyan Investment Authority sovereign wealth fund is suing Goldman Sachs for inappropriately coercing its naïve staff into giving its sovereign wealth fund cash to the bank to invest in products they did not understand.

Getty Images Growth in the sustainable-fund business, regardless of how “green” some of its investments are, is set to continue.

Share this article Share 'And even now that companies are under the spotlight and seem to acknowledge that microbeads are a bad idea, they are still not making commitments that cover all their products or all kinds of plastic.' Cosmetic companies have offered a limited removal of the beads from their creams and scrubs by 2020. But Mary Creagh, who chairs the Commons environmental audit committee, said: 'A voluntary approach to phasing out plastic microbeads simply won't wash. We need a full legal ban. Microbeads are flushed into rivers and seas by the trillion where they attract toxins, threaten marine life and can reach the human food chain 'There is nothing to stop us banning these products in this country. We would like to see our Government showing leadership.' Most microbeads are made from polyethylene, which is the same material used to make plastic bags, bulletproof vests and even knee replacements. Once in the environment and seas they effectively become a magnet for toxins, such as pesticides. Eaten by fish and shellfish they can find their way into the food chain. DAILY MAIL COMMENT  They are tiny particles contained in countless bathroom products including shower gels, exfoliating scrubs and anti-ageing creams. But it is increasingly clear that microbeads, which, like plastic bags, are made of polyethylene, are a dangerous and unnecessary pollutant. Shockingly, every time someone takes a shower about 100,000 plastic particles wash into the sea, becoming a magnet for pesticides and other toxins. They are then swallowed by fish and other marine wildlife and end up on our dinner tables. The average plate of shellfish could contain 50 pieces of plastic. As this newspaper's successful campaign for a 5p charge for plastic bags showed, decisive government action can make a huge difference to the environment. Bag use is down 85 per cent since it was introduced. Some cosmetics companies are committed to phasing out microbeads by 2020. But why should we wait four years, especially when other countries are moving more quickly? The US has already introduced a ban to come into force next year, and Canada is also considering legislation. The EU appears to be dragging its heels and, in any case, will become an irrelevance post-Brexit. Given the growing weight of evidence, it is clearly time for ministers to ban this plastic poison – now. A study published in Australia last week showed for the first time that pollutants in microbeads are absorbed into the bodies of fish. As many as 100,000 are washed into the sea following a single shower. The UK daily total is put at 86 tons. Tamara Galloway, a professor at Exeter University, said: 'We find pieces of plastic in every sample of seawater we study from round the world. 'Many marine animals ingest microbeads, mistaking them for food. They can then be lodged in the animals' gut – preventing them from eating nutritious food. 'An average plate of oysters could contain up to 50 plastic particles. Most people would probably prefer not to be eating microbeads with their food.' The demand for a ban was made by a coalition including the Marine Conservation Society, Greenpeace, the Environmental Investigation Agency and Fauna & Flora International. In the joint statement, they said: 'There is huge public support for a ban on microbeads. With companies dragging their feet on this issue, it's now time for Theresa May's Government to take comprehensive action on this crucial issue by banning any microplastics in household products which could end up going down the drain and into our seas.' Environment minister George Eustice has signalled a willingness to impose a UK ban if the EU fails to step up. Giving evidence to MPs earlier this year, he said: 'We do not rule out doing it at national level.' The Cosmetic, Toiletry & Perfumery Association said manufacturers were taking steps voluntarily. Its director general, Dr Christopher Flower, said: 'A recommendation was issued by Cosmetics Europe in 2015 that such ingredients ought to be discontinued from use in products such as exfoliants and scrubs where the microbeads may ultimately end up in waterways. This course of action was chosen because it would have an impact far more quickly than waiting for any legislative ban. The European Commission is considering a ban but MPs from all parties and environmental groups want one now 'Although the date for final removal was stated at 2020, the majority of use would be discontinued long before then.' Some firms are either removing the beads or have never used them, including Unilever, Procter & Gamble, L'Oreal, Boots, Clearasil, Superdrug and Marks & Spencer. Waitrose has announced its own ban on the sale of beauty products containing the beads. Others, such as Johnson & Johnson, Estee Lauder and Elizabeth Arden, are in the process of removing them. A poll by campaign groups found more than 90 per cent of Britons support an outright ban. And 84 per cent said they would be turned off from buying a product if it was found to be polluting the oceans.

As the Mail launches a campaign to ban them, here's all you need to know about the microbeads menace  For two decades, microbeads have been used to bulk out cheap shower gel, make shampoo silky and give facial scrubs a refreshing zing. And in those 20 years, trillions upon trillions of the minuscule plastic balls have been allowed to wash down our plug holes into the oceans — wreaking havoc on marine life such as dolphins, turtles and fish and, more worryingly, making their way into the very food we eat. No consumer asked for plastic balls to be added to their daily skincare regime. No one demanded they be sprinkled liberally into Tesco own-brand toothpaste so that children unwittingly swallow plastic every time they brush their teeth. For two decades, microbeads have been used to bulk out cheap shower gel, make shampoo silky and give facial scrubs a refreshing zing In those 20 years, trillions upon trillions of the minuscule plastic balls have been allowed to wash down our plug holes into the oceans Yet introduced they were — by a cosmetics industry desperate to make their products more appealing to consumers — and their impact has been extraordinary. According to the latest estimates, up to 51 trillion tiny particles of plastic — including many from cosmetics products — have been dumped in the oceans in the past few decades. The particles are so pervasive and long-lasting that every stretch of water from the North Sea to the Pacific contains traces of plastic. Microbeads and other such plastic junk have turned regions of our once open seas into cesspools of plastic. The largest is the 'great Pacific garbage patch', a swirling current of plastic rubbish which stretches thousands of miles. Dubbed the world's biggest rubbish dump, it is made up of floating bags, bottle tops, discarded fishing nets and polystyrene chunks. And around it all, like a thick plastic soup, float microscopic particles of plastic. Finally, however, the tide seems to be turning, as an influential cross-party group of MPs calls for them to be banned. So what's the truth about microbeads? Here, we explain what they are — and how you can avoid them . . . WHAT ARE THEY? Microbeads are tiny balls of plastic which are added to a host of household and personal-care products. They vary in size, but most are between 0.001mm and 1mm. Smaller beads are used to make cosmetics and cleansers smooth and silky; larger ones help to make them more exfoliating. Sometimes they are used to add colour or a glittery appearance, or to bulk out the product. They are usually made from polyethylene — the stuff used to make plastic bags, toys, bottles and even bullet-proof vests. Others are made from oil-derived plastics such as polystyrene and polypropylene. WHAT PRODUCTS CONTAIN THEM? They are most commonly used in exfoliating scrubs and facial cleansers. The balls help to remove dead cells and dirt without feeling too rough on our skin. For instance, Johnson and Johnson's Clean and Clear Exfoliating Daily Wash contains them — as does Clinique Exfoliating Scrub. A single facial scrub wash can use up to 94,500 microbeads, while a 150ml tub of the stuff contains nearly three million. They are added to hand soap to give it a smooth texture, and to shower gels and sunblocks to help them spread easily. Microbeads are also added to some over-the-counter medicines to make them easier to swallow. They have even been used in some toothpaste as an abrasive to help remove plaque. Tesco adds them to its Steps Toothpaste — sold as a 'gentle mint toothpaste' for children aged two and under. Ironically, the tube features a happy-looking turtle swimming in the sea — turtles are one of the main victims of plastic pollution. Last year the United Nations Environment Programme claimed: 'A typical exfoliating shower gel can contain roughly as much microplastic in the cosmetic formulation as is used to make the plastic packaging it comes in.' No consumer asked for plastic balls to be added to their daily skincare regime WHEN DID THEY APPEAR? The first patents for microbeads were filed in the Sixties. But it wasn't until the Nineties that they took off. The balls replaced traditionally-used ingredients such as ground shell, silica and pumice. Manufacturers liked them because they were cheaper to make and could be mass-produced in a uniform shape. Concerns about microbeads have been growing for the past few years. In 2011, Dutch environmentalists with the North Sea Foundation began writing to manufacturers, asking them to stop using them. Since then, a growing number of marine scientists and green campaigners have called for a ban. SO WHAT'S THE PROBLEM? It starts when products containing microbeads are flushed down the plug hole. The spheres are so small most are not filtered out by sewage plants and instead flow into rivers and the seas. A single shower using shower gel and shampoo can result in 100,000 plastic particles being washed into the oceans, where they can float around for centuries. Dr Sue Kinsey, of the Marine Conservation Society, says: 'Once they are in the ocean, they enter the food chain.' Some of the plastic particles are devoured by animals at the bottom of the food chain — such as plankton. These tiny creatures are eaten by fish which, in turn, are hunted by birds, larger fish and seals — the plastic getting passed up the food chain with each meal. Other particles are ingested by whales. Grey whales feed on the bottom of oceans, scooping up everything from crabs to plankton. They need to eat 3,000 lb of food each day. Thanks to microbeads, they are also regularly consuming huge quantities of plastic. HOW WIDESCALE IS THE POLLUTION? Microbeads are part of the greater problem of plastic polluting our oceans. Every year, around eight million tonnes of plastic — in the form of microbeads, plastic bags, fishing gear and other debris — is washed into the seas. Most of the larger pieces of junk — the ones not eaten by whales, turtles and sea birds — are broken down by sunlight and the movement of waves into smaller and smaller pieces of plastic until they are the same size as microbeads. According to the best estimates, between 15 and 51 trillion particles of plastic are floating in the seas. That's equivalent to 2,000 particles for every one of the 7.5 billion people living on Earth. Around 1-4 per cent of all those particles are microbeads from cosmetics. No one can say for sure how many of them came from the UK. But Professor Richard Thompson, a marine scientist at Plymouth University, says around 680 tonnes of microbeads are used in cosmetic products in the UK each year. 'That's the equivalent of 30 articulated lorries full of microbeads,' he says. Not all of those microbeads will be washed into the seas. Some will be captured at sewage treatment plants and then spread with all the other sewage on farmlands. But most of them will end up in the seas. And that is just a tiny proportion compared with the rest of the world's contribution. The horrifying truth is that no one knows how much of this plastic gunk is despoiling the oceans — and no one knows the toll it is taking on wildlife and people. A single shower using shower gel and shampoo can result in 100,000 plastic particles being washed into the oceans, where they can float around for centuries WHAT HARM IS DONE TO WILDLIFE? Hundreds of marine animals, including fish, mussels, oysters, lobsters and plankton, have been shown to consume microbeads and other small particles of plastic. A study by Prof Thompson found that a third of the 500 fish he captured in the English Channel had swallowed plastic particles. He has also shown that almost every sample of water collected from the sea, or sand collected from a beach anywhere in the world, will have traces of plastic. These particles can harm animals by clogging up their digestive systems and stomachs, making them feel full when, in fact, they are actually starving. Beads of plastic are also like sponges, attracting toxins — tiny particles of poisons and pollutants such as PCB, the hormone-mimicking chemicals churned out by industry and power stations which can hang around in the air and seas for decades. PCBs have been shown to interfere with the fertility of fish, birds, turtles and shellfish. Around 90 per cent of seabirds have some plastic in their guts, researchers reported last year. And it's not just marine life that suffers. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency says PCBs can cause cancer in animals and are probably carcinogenic for humans. Women exposed to high levels of PCBs before or during pregnancy can give birth to children with lowered cognitive ability, immunocompromised and motor control problems. CAN THEY GET INTO OUR BODIES? Plastic pollution is so common we are likely to be consuming plastic indirectly each time we tuck into a bowl of mussels, a plate of oysters or a fish-and-chip supper. The levels of plastic in such meals will be low — but no one can say whether microbeads and other microplastics accumulate in our bodies or are flushed out. We are exposed to plastic in the shower when using facial scrub when a dribble gets into our mouths. And if your toothpaste contains microbeads, families are swallowing plastic every time they brush their teeth. Doctors aren't yet sure what sort of health risk this may pose. 'We don't know whether it will create a human health problem, but it's better to be cautious now, rather than wait for 50 years to discover it's too late,' says Dr Kinsey. HOW CAN YOU TELL WHAT HAS THEM? You might assume microbeads would be flagged up in big letters on packaging. But they aren't. To find out whether a shower gel or exfoliating scrub contains microbeads you need to read the label — usually with a magnifying glass — to see if it contains plastic. The tell-tale words to look out for are polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polyethylene tereph-thalate (PET), polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), as well as nylon. The balls replaced traditionally-used ingredients such as ground shell, silica and pumice. Manufacturers liked them because they were cheaper to make and could be mass-produced in a uniform shape WHAT IS THE UK INDUSTRY DOING? The industry claims it is taking action. The Cosmetics, Toiletry and Perfumery Association director-general Dr Chris Flower says: 'Any remaining use of plastic microbeads in wash-off products will have been phased out by 2018, two years ahead of the recommended date of 2020.' However, some companies are proceeding earlier with the voluntary ban. Procter and Gamble — owner of Pantene, Oral-B and Olay — and Estee Lauder, which owns Clinique and Origins, say they will phase out microbeads by the end of 2017. But according to campaigners, manufacturers have dragged their feet over plastic pollution. The Marine Conservation Society's Dr Kinsey says 'We would have liked them to have acted far more promptly. I know they have to find alternative formulations, but some companies seem to have found them faster than others. We'd like a blanket ban that creates a level playing field for everyone.' WHY CAN'T THEY BE BANNED NOW? The cross-party Environmental Audit Committee wants them to be banned immediately — as do marine conservation charities. And other countries have acted far more quickly. The U.S. has already introduced a ban which comes into effect from 2017. Canada and some EU countries are also seriously considering legislation. Fauna and Flora International says the UK ban should have no loopholes. 'It must include all solid microplastics used for any purpose — not just for exfoliation,' said a spokesperson. 'And it should cover all products commonly washed down the drain. This includes a wide range of cosmetic and personal care products, as well as many household cleaners.' ARE THERE ANY ALTERNATIVES?  If you don't have time to comb the back of packets for the tell-tale ingredients mentioned earlier, it's worth noting that some products don't contain microbeads. For example, Aquafresh Complete Care Extra Fresh toothpaste, Eau Thermal Avène Gentle shower gel and Boots Tea Tree & Witch Hazel Charcoal face scrub are all microbead-free. If you raid your kitchen cupboards, salt and sugar, coffee grounds and apricot kernels can all be used as microbead-free alternative scrubs.

Now, the canton that’s home to almost 1,000 multinationals is set to use tax to burnish its appeal. Geneva will on Aug. 30 propose cutting its corporate tax rate to 13.49 percent from 24.2 percent, according to three people with knowledge of the matter. For an interim period of five years, the rate will be a slightly higher 13.79 percent, said the people who asked not be named as the matter hasn’t been made public. While that’s 2.2 percentage points higher than the average preferential rate currently offered to many foreign firms, the new regime will improve the Swiss city’s competitive position, according to Credit Suisse Group AG. “I could see Geneva going up very high in the ranks,” said Thierry Boitelle, a lawyer at Bonnard Lawson in the city. “International companies will be glad to have some certainty when the new rate is finally implemented.” Like the rest of Switzerland, Geneva has been buffeted by the strong franc and concern over immigration quotas, while the demise of banking secrecy has hurt the city’s financial industry. The stakes are high for the politicians contemplating a tax rate to underpin the French-speaking canton’s allure: multinationals from Procter & Gamble Co. to commodity trader Mercuria Energy Group Ltd. account for 76,000 jobs and 40 percent of the economy. Economic Risk “It’s the mother of all battles for us,” says Vincent Subilia, deputy director of international affairs and arbitration at the Geneva Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Services. “We can’t afford to lose it because the attractiveness of Geneva and the shape that our economy will take for generations to come are at risk here.” A rate of about 13 percent would see Geneva jump 13 places to become the third-most attractive of Switzerland’s 26 cantons, trailing only Zug and Zurich, according to a study by Credit Suisse. “Geneva and the western part of Switzerland will be even more attractive for firms, especially compared to France,” said Thomas Ruehl, head of regional research at Credit Suisse. “We see the corporate tax reform as a big opportunity for Geneva.” France, which borders the canton to the south, east and west, has a tax rate of 33.33 percent, according to figures published by KPMG. Within Europe, Geneva’s rate would only exceed a number of smaller economies such as Ireland’s 12.5 percent and Montenegro, which has the region’s lowest rate of 9 percent. That will mean Geneva competes with Ireland, the Netherlands and the U.K. as a low-tax jurisdiction, while it may also provide Zurich with stiffer competition for Swiss corporates, said Boitelle.  For a QuickTake explainer on Switzerland’s people power, click here. Still, tax alone won’t be enough to turn Geneva’s fortunes around, according to the lawyer, who highlights the need for Switzerland to resolve the issues caused by voters backing a referendum in 2014 to introduce quotas for EU migrants. “Tax reform won’t change that,” said Boitelle. “Geneva’s appeal lies in a good business culture, plus quality of life, a well-educated workforce and stability. They need to come up with some kind of solution for the immigration issue.” The new taxation regime will also leave a projected 459 million-franc ($475 million) hole in Geneva’s finances, according to the people familiar. The shortfall is likely to be something close to that, said Roland Godel, a Geneva finance department spokesman, who declined to comment further on the reform before next week’s announcement. Referendum Looms “The real challenge will be on the budget side,” said Elias Hafner, an economist at UBS Group AG, adding that Geneva’s higher ratio of public officials to residents than other parts of Switzerland provides scope for cuts. That’s a concern for Romain de Sainte Marie, head of the Socialist Party in Geneva’s cantonal parliament. “We need an attractive tax rate and we do want to retain most jobs in Geneva, but we must also guarantee the same level of public service,” said de Sainte Marie. “For Geneva’s attractiveness, the quality of public services is just as important as the corporate tax rate.” Opposition to the new rate from left-leaning political parties will probably trigger a referendum as it would only require 500 signatures. In a March plebiscite in the neighboring canton of Vaud, 87.1 percent of voters backed cutting the corporate tax rate to 13.79 percent from 21.65 percent. That change will probably mean fewer resources to spend on theaters, museums, street-cleaning and creches in the canton’s main city Lausanne, according to municipal councilor Florence Germond. Failure to agree on a competitive tax rate in Geneva could result in an exodus of multinationals, cutting cantonal revenues by an even greater margin, said Denis Berdoz, a partner at Baker & McKenzie in Geneva, who specializes in tax and corporate law. “They don’t really have a choice,” said Berdoz. “If the companies leave, the loss could be much higher.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Though by no means flashy, Kimberly Clark's consistent, steady approach makes it a dividend powerhouse capable of standing the test of time. Andrew Tonner (TMFTheDude) Aug 24, 2016 at 7:30PM Image source: Getty Images. You don't increase your dividend for 43 consecutive years without doing something right. In the unsexy but lucrative world of dividend investing, Kimberly-Clark (NYSE:KMB) is a rare breed of company. Few corporations are lucky enough to remain in operation for nearly 150 years, making Kimberly-Clark stock's history and dividend track record both outliers in the extreme. So, what makes Kimberly-Clark such a remarkable stock for long-term investors? Let's find out. Breaking down Kimberly-Clark's stock history As should come as no surprise, Kimberly-Clark's long history rests upon decades of exceptional performance. Companies simply don't stay in business for so long unless they're doing something right. As such, it comes as no surprise that Kimberly-Clark stock has outperformed the broader market since its public debut: KMB data by YCharts. In recent years, however, much like its rivals Procter & Gamble and Unilever, Kimberly-Clark's business has shown signs of maturing. Though by no means a negative for investors, it's important to understand how exactly Kimberly-Clark generates its returns. Here's a snapshot of Kimberly-Clark's average 10-year performance across several key financial drivers, as defined by the company: Metric  Sales Growth Organic Sales Growth EPS Growth Kimberly-Clark Corporation Goal 3%-5% 3%-5% 5%-8% Kimberly-Clark Corporation Actual 3% 4% 6% Data source: Kimberly-Clark Corporation. Note: Above percentages represent 2004-15 averages. Kimberly-Clark closely tracks these metrics to ensure the company continues to deliver on its long-term strategic objectives as defined in the company's Global Business Plan. Developed in 2003, Kimberly-Clark's strategy rests on four main priorities: "Manage its brand portfolio to balance growth, profitability, and cash flow." "Invest in brands, innovation, and growth initiatives." "Deliver sustainable cost reduction." "Utilize disciplined capital management to improve ROIC and return cash to shareholders." All told, the company has made good on these mandates. In addition to meeting its stated targets above, Kimberly-Clark also maintained its capital investments within their desired range, while improving its ROIC about 75 basis points each year. Many of these traits are hallmarks of mature consumer staples companies like Kimberly-Clark. However, this formula of continued optimization and returning ample capital to shareholders, though by no means flashy, is a tried-and-true method for producing compelling returns for shareholders. Kimberly-Clark, dividend dynamo At its advanced age, Kimberly-Clark's strategy for success lies in consistent and slightly above-average performance as the secret sauce to its longtime market-beating success. Chief among them, the company's dividend growth prowess is critical for shareholders seeking both passive income and long-term capital appreciation. Thankfully for its investors, Kimberly-Clark's dividend growth also remains substantially superior to the broad market.  Metric Current Yield Long-Term Annual Growth Rate Kimberly-Clark Dividend 2.9% 8% S&P 500 Dividend 2% 5.9% Difference 0.9% 2.1% Data source: Kimberly-Clark investor relations, multpl.com.  Thanks to the magic of compounding interest, while these differences may seem small, they make a big difference over time. For example, a lump some of $1,000 growing at Kimberly-Clark's 8% growth rate will be worth slightly over $10,000 in 30 years, whereas the S&P 500's growth rate would result in that same $1,000 increasing to only $5,500. This also overlooks the effect of the differences in the two securities' current yields, which would have a further magnifying effect in Kimberly-Clark's favor. Kimberly-Clark is the kind of consistent, steady investment that conservative, long-term investors should love. It's unlikely to wow you in any one given year, but thanks to its consistent adherence to long-term dividend growth and business improvements, investors willing to buy and hold shares in this high-quality company are likely to be glad they did.

Addressing a workshop on Urban Transformation through Administrative Reform and New Approach at Administrative Staff College here attended by the representatives of urban bodies, Sonowal advised them to plant fruit-bearing trees and medicinal plants to earn additional revenue. "Ramdev's company has an annual turnover of Rs 10,000 crore. His company needs a large number of medicinal fruits like xilikha (myrobalan), amlokhi (amla) and omora (hog plum). You can think of it as a measure to earn revenue," he said. Sonowal cited the example of Delhi Municipal Corporation which had taken a similar route to add to its coffers. He said in the last financial year, the Delhi corporation earned Rs 10 crore by selling bor jamuk (Indian blackberries) alone. According to reports, Patanjali Ayurved is targeting Rs 10,000-crore revenue in the current fiscal after sales grew 150 per cent in the previous financial year to Rs 5,000 crore. The Hardwar-based "swadeshi" company has multinationals like Nestle, Colgate-Palmolive and Procter & Gamble in India in its sights. Sonowal's preference for Baba Ramdev's company is understandable given the televangelist's matching political leanings. Ramdev has only received kindness from Assam ever since the BJP-led government assumed office. The Bodoland Territorial Council "offered" over 3,800 bighas of land to his company to set up a unit in the Bodoland Territorial Area Districts (BTAD). The Bodoland People's Front, which heads the council, is an ally of the BJP. Patanjali Ayurved Ltd plans to set up several manufacturing units across the country during this financial year. Sonowal asked the urban bodies' representatives to increase revenue and requested them not to consider the poor financial condition of the government as a hindrance to their work. "It is not money, but qualities like your willingness, hard work and honestly that can really keep the town clean. Think of the responsibility people have bestowed on you, involve citizens and keep working," he said. Sonowal, who arrived an hour late, promised the representatives that the state government would introduce three services within six months in order to bring efficiency in the functioning of the urban bodies. He asked chief secretary V.K. Pipersenia to finalise all the formalities. The three services are - urban administrative service, urban engineer and planner service and urban finance and accounts service. "For proper functioning of a town body you need to have sufficient knowledge and expertise like how they are administered and how revenue are generated and spent. To help you all I have promised you to introduce these three services within six months."  More stories in North East Champion goes missing Green tribunal raps refinery Kuldeep rescue efforts on Plan to bridge digital divide Nath new top cop of city Rally against drugs Sarma sermon on schemes Of roots and identity NGO plea to stop illegal tobacco sale Blame game begins over clashes Rights groups decry attack Teri proposes ways for inclusive growth NPF blows poll bugle Forum focus on women's safety Manipur constable aspirants call strike Teachers withdraw protest Conrad slams govt over funds 10-year RI for three peddlers Rousing reception for Ripun in Barak Valley Push for air, road links via Bangladesh to Bengal    Copyright © 2016 The Telegraph.

Here are my rules to prepare Abigail Stevenson | @A_StevensonCNBC Wednesday, 24 Aug 2016 | 6:12 PM ETCNBC.com SHARES show chapters Cramer: Next flash crash will happen. Here are my rules to prepare    Wednesday, 24 Aug 2016 | 6:00 PM ET | 11:34 In the past six years there have been two flash crashes, including one that occurred exactly a year ago in 2015. Jim Cramer will be ready for the next one, and wants investors to be prepared, too. "Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, and I'm an idiot who deserves the heat," the "Mad Money" host said. The term flash crash refers a special event when the stock market drops quickly, almost in the blink of an eye. It can result in a dramatic loss of about 1,000 points on the Dow. Both flash crashes had a similar theme: something negative overseas either triggered, or was thought to trigger an event in the U.S. that investors couldn't grasp. It caused an immense amount of fear and paralysis. In Cramer's perspective, it's not a matter of if a flash crash will happen again, it's a matter of when. So, to prepare investors, Cramer outlined his rules for the next flash crash. Getty Images A trader works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on August 24, 2015 in New York City. No. 1 Never use market orders. A market order is an order to buy or sell a stock executed at the current market price. Market orders can be messy, and have no specific price allocated, so investors can get crushed by machine algorithms, Cramer said. That is why he recommended limit orders, which is an order for a set amount of securities at a specific price, or better. In the flash crash of 2010, Cramer monitored Procter & Gamble to buy for his charitable trust. After all, if Greece was really the reason for the flash crash back then, people would still need to shave and wash their clothes. "When you suspect that you've got a flash crash on your hands, you need to be ready with your own Procter & Gamble-like ideas," Cramer said. No. 2 Have multiple stock ideas. Investors cannot just reach for a Procter & Gamble, because some stocks will crash harder than others, and no one knows which ones they will be. Cramer recommended high-quality stocks with little economic sensitivity. Those are the ones left standing once the smoke clears and have a history of being able to pay dividends no matter what. For instance, General Mills paid its dividends through two world wars, the Great Depression and Great Recession. Stocks like PepsiCo, Dominion Resources, American Electric Power, Verizon and AT&T all landed on Cramer's radar. "When the next flash crash occurs, we might not have the luxury to step off the desk to make calls. We may not be able to see Procter trading down," Cramer said, "But we will be ready, and yes, we will even be salivating for the next flash crash so we can brag that not only were we there, we made a killing."

Photo: Paul Warner/Getty Images Now that the Rio Olympics are over, it's time for the world's top athletes to take on an entirely different (and presumably far less exciting) challenge: returning to normal life. And for many, this means switching back from spandex (in some cases, extremely sparkly spandex) to regular-person clothes. Of course, everyday style differs from athlete to athlete, so we asked P&G-sponsored sports stars Allyson Felix, who took home the gold in the women’s 4x400 relay and the silver in the women’s 400-meter race, and April Ross, bronze medalist in the women’s beach volleyball doubles tournament, what they prefer to wear when off the clock. We also spoke with Final Five member Aly Raisman, who won silver in the women’s gymnastics all-around competition and serves as an ambassador for Aeropostale's ultra-stretchy (of course!) denim offerings. Below, their thoughts on on- and off-duty style and beauty, including Allyson’s tips on picking the perfect running shoe and Aly’s topknot tutorial. Spoiler: she uses nine elastics. NINE. What’s your style like when you're not competing or training? Allyson: "Los Angeles’s laid-back attitude can be seen in my style both on and off the track. My style during my days off is comfortable and simple, with an edge. I enjoy mixing up styles to complement different pieces of my outfit. If the main focus is on my sneakers, I will keep the rest of my outfit simple. Most people see me in training and competition gear, so I think it’s always a surprise when people see me off the track and dressed up a bit – whether I'm going out with friends or family or to a formal event or concert. Off the track, my style varies a bit. Sometimes I will go for the elegant, timeless pieces and other times I will grab something more interesting or in a bold color." Aly: "I like stretchy jeans because they’re good for any body type. A lot of athletes struggle to find clothes that fit them well. Like, my waist is really tiny but then I’m muscular, so it’s hard to find the right fit, but these are really great. Now that I’m taking a little bit of a break from gymnastics, I’ll be wearing denim every day." April: "I describe my style as beachy feminine. I like to wear my favorite Ralph Lauren jean shorts with a girly, flowy top. I look forward to getting a little bit more dressed up – wearing a dress and some heels and spending more time on my hair and makeup when my husband and I go out to dinner." April, how do you keep yourself protected from too much sun? April: "The best sunglasses for sports, especially beach volleyball, are the Oakley Jawbreakers – I love those. [And to protect my hair,] I always wear a visor!" Allyson, what do you look for in a running shoe? Allyson: "I look for a shoe that has a great fit, flexibility, and strength, and is lightweight. Recently, I have been competing in my Nike Zoom Superfly Flyknits. I worked with their research lab to create this spike which is specific to body as well as my races’ needs and requirements. Their engineers know the science and performance innovation behind a great shoe and I always feel confident running with their shoes." Aly, how do you get that perfect topknot? Aly: "So what I do is I wet my hands first — I don’t completely wet my hair because then it’ll be too heavy. But I wet my hair [using my hands], put some hairspray in it, and put it in a ponytail first. A really high ponytail. I’ll do two elastics in the ponytail so that it’s tight, and then I’ll twist my hair and wrap it around and put one hair elastic in, and then fill the rest with bobby pins so you get all the little flyaways. And then I do a couple more hair elastics so that it stays. It doesn’t have to be the same amount every time, but it’s probably around eight or nine [elastics]." April, what’s your beauty routine like? April: "It’s pretty minimal. I’ll apply sunscreen and put on a bit of Covergirl Lashblast Volume waterproof mascara, and that’s it! After competing, I use Aussie 3 Minute Miracle Moist to help make my hair look shiny, healthy and moisturized again. My hair takes quite a beating between the sun, sand, and sweat, and I don’t usually have the energy or time to put a lot of effort into making it look great again, so that’s an essential for me! [On my days off] I’ll spend more time doing my hair and will use some more product – usually the Aussie Sprunch Mousse to define my curls more. But I’m very simple!"

Photo: Priyanka Parashar/Mint New Delhi: Hamdard Laboratories founder Unani practitioner Hakeem Hafiz Abdul Majeed, who created Rooh Afza, once retraced its advent to the time when “the motor car was on its way in and the horse buggy on its way out”. The rose-flavoured cooling drink, introduced in 1907, has survived the partition, the era of the licence raj, carbonated drinks and Tetra Pak juices. But it hasn’t been “cool” among the millennials—people who reached adulthood around 2000. Sales suffered because of outdated packaging, indifferent marketing and limited distribution, centered in north India. The Waqf (Islamic irrevocable trust) that manages Hamdard Laboratories initially didn’t want to accept this thesis, until the younger generation joined the Islamic trust. Hamdard Laboratories, maker of Safi blood purifier and Cinkara tonic, besides Rooh Afza, is finally set for an overhaul. Its new buzzwords are modern packaging, smaller pack sizes, ready-to-drink beverages, natural personal care products, aggressive marketing and distribution, coupled with disruptive communication. The agenda is to be relevant to young consumers while leveraging its more than century-old legacy. Hamdard wants to establish itself as a company that sells food and personal care products made of “only natural ingredients.” The aim is to cross Rs.1,000 crore in annual sales by March 2019 from Rs.610 crore in the year ended 31 March 2016. “It’s all about positioning. People, essentially the youth, are turning to natural products. And they are more health conscious,” said Mansoor Ali, Hamdard’s chief sales and marketing officer. “For more than a century, we have been selling products made of natural ingredients. What they need is proper positioning through marketing and modern packaging. We need to position ourselves to be more relevant for the young,” he added. Hamdard’s best bet, naturally, is Rooh Afza. “By March 2019, it will cross Rs.500 crore (in sales). We are targeting Rooh Afza to touch Rs.300 crore sales by March 2017. Safi is estimated to reach Rs.100 crore sales by the end of this fiscal year,” said Ali, who joined Hamdard in January 2015. Ali has earlier worked with companies like Procter & Gamble Co. and Reckitt Benckiser of India Ltd, among others. He hired people from other packaged goods companies to run Hamdard’s day-to-day business. “The company is now run by seasoned professionals,” he said. Over the next couple of quarters, Hamdard will launch smaller packs, ready-to-drink variants like milkshakes, new flavours, even a sugar-free version of Rooh Afza, and energy drinks, which will be sold in PET bottles and Tetra Pak containers. “We will also be pushing our products through modern trade and e-commerce channels. We need to establish Rooh Afza as a season-agnostic beverage,” said Ali. Not just Rooh Afza. There will be new products under all the brands of Hamdard—Safi, Roghan Badam Shirin (almond oil), Sualin (cold and cough remedy) and Cinkara (health tonic). “For instance, we are planning to bring personal care products under Safi. Plans are being finalized,” said Ali. At present, about 45% of Hamdard’s revenue comes from the northern India, primarily Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Haryana. The company has started tapping markets in the eastern region and is gearing up to enter the west and south. Its manufacturing plants are located in Delhi, Manesar (Harnaya) and Ghaziabad (Uttar Pradesh). The company is looking to increase capacity at these plants and may set up a new production unit for personal care products. Investments, said Ali, would not be an issue. “About 85% of profit still goes to charity. And the Board (Waqf) has agreed to invest as required,” he added. At present, its products are available across 450,000 retail outlets. Its heritage may be an advantage but it needs greater visibility, said Sachin Bobade, a Mumbai-based equity analyst. “...Hamdard’s products need to be seen—not just in stores, but also across mass media. Today’s generation is unlikely to have any knowledge about the brand. Without a doubt, Hamdard has good potential for growth. But it needs to be visible first..,” he added. This year, Hamdard will spend about 15% of annual revenue on advertising. “We are not going for celebrity endorsements. Differentiated, disruptive communication without shift away from the core, more focus on digital and consumer engagement is the way forward,” said Ali. The firm has engaged Rediffusion Y&R as its creative agency while Delhi-based Sterco Digitex has been given the mandate for digital communication. Santosh Desai, brand expert and chief executive and managing director, Future Brands Ltd, said that to stay relevant and connect with young consumers, heritage brands often commit a common mistake of trying to appear to be cool. “It doesn’t work. Companies must have belief in their heritage instead of running away from it. Baba Ramdev’s Patanjali Ayurved, for instance, is not trying to be a cool brand, and its popularity shows its relevance,” he said. Hamdard should find a way to frame its timeless appeal in the current context. “Clearly, there is a consumer shift from aerated to health drinks. Hamdard’s Rooh Afza can be relevant if the company manages to tap into the modern health discourse and leverage it,” added Desai. Hamdard, meanwhile, is setting up wellness centres to popularize Unani as a nature cure method. “We have already set up six wellness centres. We’ll have 10 by end of the year across the country. These wellness centres will sell all company products— medicines, personal care products and beverages, besides offering remedies and therapies by qualified doctors,” said Ali. Desai said heritage works in the wellness sector, citing the example of the ayurvedic Kerala massage that is an extremely old therapy, yet remains popular in contemporary times. “A wellness centre, in Hamdard’s case, should be a way to amplify its past, not escape it,” added Desai.

LAHORE: The quality of public health services has seen a downturn over the last few decades in the country, whereas the rising population is increasing the pressure on state institutions. World Health Organisation (WHO) has recommended allocating six percent of GDP to curtail the country’s deteriorating health conditions. However, WHO claims that the total expenditure on health is 2.4 percent of GDP in Pakistan, of which private expenditure constitutes 83.6 percent. Pakistan has a mixed health system - it focuses on curative than preventive strategies. Most of the health system financing is directed towards communicable disease such as various vertical programmes running in the country. Given the current level of government expenditure on health and awareness programmes, an improvement in this sector seems unlikely. Healthcare challenges in the country are attributed to the lack of access to basic health care services, poverty, health infrastructure and personnel in addition to illiteracy, low status of women, inadequate water supplies and sanitation. Moreover, poor governance, mismanagement, inefficiencies, and lack of information are often used synonymously in a health systems context. In urban areas, access to healthcare clinics and facilities is not a problem, though the general state and quality of public services is very poor. On the other hand, in rural areas, hospitals and basic health care units are situated far from habilitations. Unfortunately, the government does not have the required infrastructure and facilities to provide the complete healthcare solutions, especially to the underprivileged. According to the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) Pakistan, only 52 percent of child deliveries take place in presence of a skilled birth attendant in country. Pakistan represents an unacceptably high maternal mortality setting and needs an immediate attention for substantial and sustained reduction in the risk of dying during pregnancy. However, almost half of the children do not receive a full course of vaccinations, with large variations in coverage across provinces, characterised by geographical and wealth inequities. Although, Human Immunodeficiency Virus prevalence is low in country, the outbreak is concentrated in key populations such as people who inject drugs (27.2 per cent) and transgender sex workers (5.2 per cent). And these issues are just the tip of the iceberg. The need of the hour is to prepare a fully-fledged drive and/or campaign, to create awareness among the masses regarding the hardships and impediments coming their way. Private institutes can work in partnership with the government bodies at every level from the local to provincial and federal, alongside NGOs, CSOs. Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) practices is still lacking among companies in Pakistan. CSR can be understood as “The continuing commitment by businesses to behave ethically and contribute to economic development while improving the quality of life of the workforce and their families (by providing health insurance) as well as of the local community and society at large.” There is a dire need for an aggressive intervention by private institutes to strengthen the network of health services via awareness among the illiterate, who constitute the majority of population. The private sector along with NGOs could play a crucial role in spreading awareness among schools, colleges and universities. An example in this regard was set six years ago, when a private multinational Procter and Gamble Pakistan and an NGO ‘Save the Children’ came together to build 100 sanitation facilities in 100 days in major three cities including Lahore, Karachi and Quetta. They targeted 40,000 school-age children in their health and hygiene awareness campaign. Such measures could help reduce the burden of communicable disease to a large extent. Private sector players need to come out of ‘their comfort zones’ to take healthcare programmes to the unreachable through effective public-private partnerships (PPP). A new cadre of community health workers needs to be created to act as a bridge between the community and health units through the Social Action Programmes. These workers can help disseminate awareness among the masses. Community participation should be encouraged in all the aspects and at all levels so as to provide quality care according to community interests and to make all the programmes successful. One major strategy by private companies could be the involvement of media in creating mass awareness among people about the health related issues and reforms, by targeting community curiosity and participation. Moreover, private companies can design their advertising/marketing campaigns in a manner to highlight these gruesome issues.

This story is part of Twitter Meet the Cincinnati native who found fame on Vine After storms and large hail, more rain and a cool down Parody Twitter account latest in rift between Ohio GOP, Trump City Council wallows in mud amid 'heroin hell' Jason Williams , jwilliams@enquirer.com 3:07 p.m. EDT August 26, 2016 Buy Photo Cincinnati City Councilman Wendell Young (Photo: The Enquirer/Liz Dufour)Buy Photo Politics Extra is a weekly column looking inside local politics As people all over the city were overdosing on heroin this week, elected officials were inside the City Hall bubble overindulging on rumor-mongering. Ohio Democratic Party Chairman David Pepper summed it all up in a Twitter hashtag on Wednesday night: #priorities City Council's are out-of-whack, and that was really exposed this week. Let's recap: All heroin hell broke loose Tuesday night when Cincinnati police responded to 21 overdose calls in a matter of hours. On Wednesday afternoon, City Council sat in a hastily called special meeting to address whispers that City Manager Harry Black's job could be in jeopardy. Politics Extra has another hashtag for this: #poppycock (to borrow a favorite word of Councilman Charlie Winburn) Winburn and Councilman Wendell Young called the special meeting – despite no emails, no testimonies, no nothing to support a reason to hold a public session and address rumors. It was nothing more than political retaliation against Mayor John Cranley, who last month did an end-around Black by negotiating raises with public-employee unions. Young badly wants City Councilwoman Yvette Simpson to unseat Cranley in next year's mayoral race. Winburn, who faces being term-limited off Council, hasn't ruled out challenging Cranley in the mayor's race. Cranley should be held accountable for that sneaky negotiating tactic, which many believe was a political maneuver to win favor with unions ahead of next year's election. Winburn and Young could exact payback on the campaign trail or by introducing legislation to offer an alternative to Cranley's wage-hike proposal. (The city and unions ended up reaching a contract agreement Thursday night.) But Wednesday was the wrong day and the wrong way. In fairness, Young and Winburn called the meeting early Tuesday before the overdose news was widespread. But the drug issues dominated the news cycle Wednesday morning, and there was plenty of time to cancel the afternoon special meeting. Vice Mayor David Mann questioned the need for the meeting, which sucked up 1 hour and 15 minutes. Councilman Christopher Smitherman called it "political gamesmanship" and a "waste of time." Council members Amy Murray and Chris Seelbach were out of town. But all others were required to sit through the bicker-filled meeting when they could have been on the streets supporting cops or meeting with drug-treatment professionals to hear their concerns or hunkered down in their offices working on legislation to try to fight the heroin scourge. There was no mention of the heroin problem during the special meeting – not even a thank you to first responders for saving lives. Heck, even a top law enforcement officer in Columbus weighed in on Twitter praising Cincinnati police for their efforts this week. (To their credit, Mann and Councilman P.G. Sittenfeld teamed up on Thursday to ask the state to help with the overdose crisis, which got worse throughout the week. Sittenfeld's efforts to address the issue began before the special meeting.) After The Enquirer tweeted City Hall reporter Sharon Coolidge's story recapping the meeting late Wednesday, Pepper responded on Twitter by saying: "While dozens of overdoses occur across city ... #productive" Pepper, a former City Councilman, declined comment to Politics Extra. He didn't need to say anything else. The overdoses should be enough of a wake-up call for City Council to get its priorities straight. If it doesn't, maybe Council should go back to two-year terms. Running every two years provides a reality check and keeps everyone from getting sucked too far into the vacuum of City Hall. Business, politics and transportation Don't be surprised if the Cincinnati USA Regional Chamber starts placing a high priority on trying to improve the region's public transportation system. The Chamber's top leaders care about it, and they recognize our bus system is woeful at connecting people to jobs. They also recognize the important role public transportation plays in attracting car-ditching Millennials, who look for jobs in places where there's a viable bus and rail system. How is this political, you ask? The Southwest Ohio Regional Transit Authority is exploring asking Hamilton County voters next year to approve a sales-tax hike to improve bus service. Chamber CEO Jill Meyer, one of few business leaders to publicly support the streetcar, replaced Cranley as the city's representative on the Hamilton County Transportation Improvement District board this week. In February, Meyer lured Brendon Cull away from Kroger to be the Chamber's new senior vice president. He is a Cranley-appointed member of the SORTA board. Cranley has quietly pushed for the Metro bus system to be improved. This issue is tailor-made for the Chamber. It would lend credibility to the effort of fixing public transportation, and the Chamber has the ability to get Procter & Gamble, Kroger, Macy's and other top companies on board. Viable transit is a key factor in fighting poverty, and it also could help Cincinnati companies beat out other Midwestern cities for talented workers. Social media squabble After Politics Extra pointed out a month ago that Seelbach had turned into Mr. Nice Guy on social media, a few loyal readers emailed to say they were skeptical about how long the City Councilman's newfound Facebook and Twitter persona would last. The answer: Four months. In news stories on Tuesday, Cranley spokeswoman Holly Stutz Smith called on Seelbach and Young to apologize for calling Black a liar earlier this summer. Seelbach fired back on Twitter that night, posting a quote from First Lady Michelle Obama: "When they go low, we go high." Smith responded: "Calling someone a liar is going low, saying your (sic) sorry is going high." Seelbach got the last word: "Check time your boss threatened African American Civil Rights Icon Marian Spencer #LowAsYouCanGo" Cranley and Spencer butted heads over the mayor's proposed city parks tax last year. But Cranley helped in the effort to rename part of Walnut Street after the city's first African-American councilwoman, and the mayor drove Spencer to the dedication ceremony of "Marian Spencer Way" in April.

Americans between 18 to 24 are largely snubbing the old-fashioned bar of soap, leading to sales declines for the likes of Ivory’s iconic 125-year old bar and its bar soap rivals, according to new data from consumer research firm Mintel. Consumers who still buy bar soap, it turns out, have something in common: they tend to be over 60 years old and are men. It’s not as if Americans are less clean. Sales of soap, bath and shower products are on the rise, with overall market growth of 2.7 percent last year, Mintel found. Sales of bar soaps, though, slipped 2.2 percent from 2014 to 2015 as younger consumers and women snubbed the traditional bar in favor of liquid soap. So what’s driving the generational shift? Millennials believe bar soaps are covered in germs after they are used. Some older Americans might scoff at that belief, and there’s some research to back them up. A 1988 study found that people who washed with bar soaps contaminated with bacteria didn’t have a detectable level of of the bacteria on their hands. There are a few issues with that study, however. For one, it was backed by Dial soap, and secondly, it was published before the spread of newer pathogens like antibiotic-resistant MRSA emerged, which raises the stakes for having clean hands. (Some millennials might point out it was published before they were born.) On the hand, some health authorities are now recommending a switch to liquid soap, with Minnesota’s Department of Health​ noting that germs can grow on bar soap and spread infections.  About 60 percent of Americans over the age of 65 believe it’s fine to wash their faces with a bar of soap, compared with only 33 percent of people between 25 to 34 years old. Liquid soap has something else going for it: a convenience factor that allows packaged goods companies to sell new products at a higher price point. Companies ranging from Procter & Gamble to Unilever are constantly tweaking their products to develop new products to appeal to young consumers. It may be no surprise that liquid soaps and in-shower moisturizers have a much higher price tag than the traditional bar of soap. “In order to turn sluggish sales around, new bar soap product launches could incorporate a wider variety of claims, especially for more luxury and premium bar soap offerings,” said Margie Nanninga, beauty analyst at Mintel, in a statement.  © 2016 CBS Interactive Inc..

Like other big companies before it, including Wal-Mart and Google, Apple recently received a federal designation for its energy subsidiary that allows it to become a wholesale seller of electricity from coast to coast. In effect, Apple is creating its own green utility company, although the main customer is itself. The motives may be economic as much as they are environmental. As a wholesaler, Apple could reduce the cost of its electricity load, which reached 831 million kilowatt-hours in the last fiscal year – enough to power about 76,000 homes for a year. But like a growing number of corporations, Apple is intent on reducing carbon dioxide emissions from electricity production — one of the biggest sources of greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming. In one ambitious venture, Apple has contracted with First Solar to begin buying a little less than half of the power later this year from California Flats, a solar energy farm now under construction. Under the terms of the deal, Apple will pay $848 million for the electricity over 25 years and receive the farm’s total output by the end of the agreement. It is one of largest commercial clean energy contracts yet. Lisa Jackson, former administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, who is now the Apple executive overseeing environmental policy, social initiatives and worldwide government affairs, said she hoped Apple could serve as a model for the many other big corporate power users that are now embracing clean energy. “This is just another sort of innovative way to get that power onto the grid so we don’t have to take the California grid-mix default, which still includes fossil fuel,” Jackson said. Google, which received its federal energy wholesale designation from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in 2010, is a big proponent of the approach Apple is now taking. “Running any kind of business, having predictability in terms of your operating costs can be very important,” said Gary Demasi, director of operations for data centre energy and location strategy at Google, which has been a leading investor in and user of clean energy. “Renewable energy, from a cost perspective, is now competitive with other forms of energy, much more so than it was a few years ago.” In the United States, the generating capacity of corporate clean energy projects has more than doubled each year since 2013, according to the Business Renewables Centre at the Rocky Mountain Institute, which tracks publicly announced deals. In 2015, 11 companies signed up for 3.23 gigawatts’ worth of projects, roughly the equivalent of five coal plants and up from 1.18 gigawatts the year before. Executives face greater pressure from shareholders and customers to show that they are doing their part to fight climate change. At the same time, corporate energy use has exploded, driven in many cases by the ravenous demands of the data cloud. “We are all becoming very large energy players, and this is a shift,” said Brian Janous, director of energy strategy at Microsoft. “Energy is not something that Microsoft or Amazon or Google really ever had to think much about prior to the advent of the cloud.” Helping drive that shift are environmental groups like the World Resources Institute. In May, it helped create the Renewable Energy Buyers Alliance, a coalition of nonprofits that has more than 60 corporations in its network, including McDonald’s and General Motors, as well as Google and Wal-Mart. Although the companies say these arrangements mean they are running their businesses on renewable energy, in reality the clean power often does not flow directly to their facilities. They typically buy the renewable energy in amounts to match what they draw from the grid — a system of swaps that Jackson of Apple likened to using an ATM. “The dollar you deposit in the bank might not be the exact same bill that you get out,” she said. Robert Shapiro, a partner at the law firm Chadbourne & Parke who focuses on project finance and energy, describes it as meaningful symbolism. “They’re actually getting power from their local utility, which may be coal,” Shapiro said. “But they’re deemed to have put into the world carbon-neutral energy, which they are deemed to have used for their load.” To keep track of clean energy credits, power generators work with registries to issue numbered certificates. “The power flows into the grid. The electrons go where they go,” Tawney said. “But because there’s a renewable-energy certificate, no one else can claim the same zero-carbon benefit.” Such complexities are necessary, executives and clean energy advocates say, because it is not often feasible to install enough renewable-power generators at corporate sites to meet companies’ full energy needs. Energy buyers’ alliance Wal-Mart, despite having installed solar panels, wind turbines and fuel cells at stores and distribution centres, can nonetheless meet only about a third of those operations’ energy needs. So it also buys renewable energy from generators and utilities, said David Ozment, director of energy at Wal-Mart stores. Procter & Gamble, another member of the energy buyers’ alliance, has arranged to purchase all of the steam from a biomass generator under construction at a plant in Georgia where it makes Charmin toilet paper and Bounty paper towels, said Jack McAneny, the company’s director of sustainability. But that was possible, he said, only because of the plant’s location near a source of waste wood and pulp for fuel and the cooperation of P&G’s partners. Among those partners are the local utility, Georgia Power, which will buy the electricity from the generator for its customers from Constellation, the company that developed and will own and operate the generator. At Apple, where the purchase or production of renewable energy has more than tripled since 2012, the company would prefer to not have to go to great lengths to ensure a clean energy supply, Jackson said. But the public energy grid is simply still too dependent on carbon-based fuels to make that possible. “If we had our preference, we’d just be able to say, ‘We want 100% green power everywhere we use power,’” Jackson said. “The best would be if we could run every one of our stores, every one of our data centres, office complex, building we have, on 100% renewable – and if we didn’t have to spend a whole bunch of our time and energy figuring out how to get that done.” Go to Top Tweet Videos New Rs. 2,000 notes recovered from gunned...

The award ceremony will take place in October at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel, Rome. On the occasion, Fischmann will receive the awards that the New York Post described as the "Oscars for business", a name well-known globally, and that singles out "good business leaders" around the world. The "Innovation of the Year" award was given to Fischmann for his water desalination technology that uses no energy, and that aims to solve some of humanity's greatest problems, like energy and water scarcity. Considered to be one of the world's most coveted awards, and described by the New York Post as the "Oscars of the business world", Fernando Fischmann, founder and President of Crystal Lagoons, won the Innovator of the Year award of the International Business Awards. Furthermore, the water desalination technology that uses no energy, developed by Crystal Lagoons, won the Innovation of the Year award, and, as a result Fischmann will receive both Stevie® Award trophies this October. The same prize has been awarded in recent years to the most important and recognized CEOs of the world like Steve Jobs from Apple, Jeff Bezos from Amazon, Kent Muhtar from Coca-Cola, Alan Mulally from the Ford Motor Company and other outstanding companies like IBM, Disney, AT&T and Coca-Cola. This year's version received over 3,800 nominations from 60 countries, and Fischmann was chosen as the person or company to have contributed most to innovation, with the company Cisco Systems taking second place. He also won the award for the main technological innovation, for his water desalination technology that uses no energy that seeks to solve some of humanity's greatest problems, such as energy and water scarcity. The jury for the International Business Awards is composed of over 200 opinion leaders, executives and academics from around the world, including representatives from Nike, DHL, HSBC, Coca-Cola, Procter & Gamble, American Express and others. The judges made tremendously positive comments about the scientist, such as "Fernando Fischmann is the embodiment of an innovator! What is even more remarkable is that his innovation has a positive impact on the environment". Another member of the committee praised the innovator, affirming that "Fischmann sees a challenge, sees an opportunity and looks for a solution or creates new technology to accomplish his goal. An innovator!" Additionally, another judge expressed that, "it is a wonderful innovation and initiative to provide solutions to humanity's critical need for survival. A well anticipated innovation and a noble contribution to the wellbeing of the world". The International Business Awards gala ceremony will take place on 21st October in the Rome Cavalieri, Waldorf Astoria Hotel, Rome, Italy. On the occasion, Fischmann will receive two Stevie® Award trophies, golden statues that recognize the winners of these international awards that were created by R.S. Owens, the same manufacturers as Hollywood's Oscars. The track record of the founder of Crystal Lagoons and the success story of this innovation multinational, that in less than 7 years has 15 offices around the world and a packed portfolio that totals 400 projects in different stages of development in 60 countries –that have transformed it into the World's Top Amenity- have meant that the scientist has received more than 20 additional awards. Amongst the awards one can highlight the USA's Best New Business award, Keys to Miami from the Beacon Council, Innovation Award from Florida's Governor, two Guinness World Records, as well as being the only executive to have received awards for Best Entrepreneur, Best Innovator and Best Businessman. Fischmann has developed and patented various technologies that have enabled a change in people's lifestyles around the world, with a portfolio of over 1,000 patents in 160 countries globally.

His name is on the door of one of Madison’s oldest and most successful tech companies. And he made the UW-Madison Alumni Association’s Forward Under 40 list when he was just 25 years old. But the 29-year-old president and CEO of Hardin Design & Development tends to shy away from the spotlight. And when he gets home from work, you won’t catch him near a computer. He lives in a gorgeous house on eight acres in Verona, which he owns free and clear. His garage, which he remodeled all by himself, is filled with luxury vehicles — Porsche, Jaguar, Mercedes. He loves fine dining and wine so much that he hand-built his very own cellar, with room to store more than 800 bottles. He’s addicted to home improvement projects, harvesting timber from his property to build things like an outdoor fire pit with seating for up to 40 friends. Life is good in the Hardin household. “People joke that I’m kind of a recluse,” Hardin says. “I’m not someone who’s going to 10 networking events a week. I’d rather be out working on my land.” Madison’s tech and startup scene has exploded in the last decade, with local innovators and industry groups continually pushing it to become the entrepreneurial epicenter for the entire Midwest. Many of the local success stories have since become household names — Epic Systems and its various spinoffs, EatStreet and the ever-growing stable of local food tech companies, PerBlue, Raven Software and the array of other gaming companies. But while some startup stories have garnered attention and grabbed headlines, other innovators tend to fly more under the radar. Hardin says he’s “not really wired to seek out publicity” — a personality type that makes him unique among CEOs. “Jon is definitely an enigmatic figure in the tech community,” says co-founder Scott Resnick, who serves as the public face of Hardin Design & Development. “I get to go do fun outreach and sell the Hardin brand, and Jon’s back at HQ doing programming — and that’s what he does very well.” Hardin’s close friends like to joke that he’s always one stroke shy of perfection — he scored 35 out of 36 on the ACT; he got one B in college. But he’s earned a reputation for hard work and intellect through his record of solving some of the toughest software engineering problems brought forth by his clients. “Folks may not see that side of Hardin, but he’s the engine that drives the company,” Resnick says. Since the company’s humble beginnings in a dorm room on the second floor of UW-Madison’s Chadbourne Hall, Hardin Design & Development’s business has grown considerably. What started as two college kids trolling Craigslist for freelance web development gigs has evolved to a fully fledged boutique software development firm with offices in Madison, Chicago and Dallas and an extensive list of clients, both domestic and international. These days, Hardin Design & Development has as an average of 30 different projects in the pipeline at any given time. They range considerably in size and scope — the smallest can be knocked out by a single developer in three days, and the largest can take a team of five developers up to four years to build. One such project, which Hardin describes as the “crown jewel” of the company’s portfolio, is called Visual Manager, a commercial real estate management and business intelligence platform that the company developed at the request of a client, Fischer & Company. It’s now being used by FedEx, IBM and a host of other big companies. The technology is a complex marriage of data storage and analytics, which allows users to take information from disparate sources and gain insight on things like competitor locations, market characteristics and demographic trends. The Visual Manager project was a massive undertaking — not to mention a huge get for the small company — but both Hardin and Resnick speak modestly about landing the deal, crediting the intersecting relationships they’ve built over the years and the stellar reputation the firm has established. “At the end of the day, it all goes back to talent,” Resnick says. “And Jon is one of the best developers, if not the best developer, I’ve ever had the pleasure of knowing.” Hardin is hardly the only hard-working entrepreneur to escape notice. The city is filled with people quietly pursuing innovative ideas and shaping Madison’s future. But, like Hardin, they all have a story to tell. × Expand Laura Zastrow Winnie Karanja — The inspirer Winnie Karanja has a vivid memory of what it felt like to be the only girl — and the only African American — in her web design class at McFarland High School. “I remember thinking, ‘This isn’t okay,’” says Karanja, who immigrated to the Madison area from Kenya with her parents and sister in 1999. “There’s such a benefit to having diversity in the tech field.” Women and minorities are notoriously underrepresented in the tech industry, both in Madison and across the nation. Karanja’s desire to shift those demographics and encourage girls and students of color to break into the field led her to create Maydm, an educational nonprofit that teaches kids a range of entry-level tech industry skills. Karanja founded the initiative in November 2015, and in the first teaching sessions held from April through June of this year, she’s reached more than 80 students. Of those, 40% were girls, and 76% were students of color — statistics that are “very unlike the tech field,” Karanja says. She’s still analyzing demographic data for sessions held in July and August. “Technology is made for everybody, but it’s not made by everybody,” Karanja says. Maydm, which is a play off the phrase “made by them,” aims to get students comfortable with the idea that they, too, can code the next big app or build the next iPhone. Karanja is young — she’s under 30, but she declines to reveal her exact age, out of concerns that people in the industry won’t take her seriously. A self-taught coder and a graduate of the London School of Economics and Politics with a bachelor’s in education and a master’s in developmental economics, Karanja says her background gives her a “unique and intersectional worldview” that has helped define Maydm’s platform. As a teacher, she sees technology-focused education as an essential tool to propel girls and students of color into higher-earning jobs. And as a developmental economist, she knows that good jobs are among the most important factors for reducing poverty, hunger and housing insecurity among vulnerable populations.  “The average tech job in Wisconsin [pays] $70,000 per year,” Karanja says. “That’s where we want our students to be.” Maydm targets youth from third to 12th grade, offering single-day and weekend training sessions as well as a flagship, semester-long course that officially launches this fall with the new school year. The program is fee-based, but Maydm partners with sponsor organizations to provide scholarships for low-income students. Students learn technical skills, including programming and working with open-source electronic hardware, as well as soft skills like communication, teamwork, leadership and resume-writing. Students develop a portfolio showcasing the skills they learned from Maydm, which they can use as a reference when looking for a job. Partners from local tech companies, like Bendyworks and Zendesk, serve as mentors, giving students an insider’s look at how the industry works. Surveys given to Maydm participants before and after the course show that the curriculum has a big impact on the way students think about themselves and technology. Karanja believes Maydm will eventually become known as a “top talent pipeline” that connects bright young workers from diverse backgrounds to job opportunities at local tech companies. In the future, she plans to form an alumni network to make sure program graduates remain connected as they begin their professional lives. “If Wisconsin is moving to become a tech hub,” Karanja says, “it should not be an afterthought to bring in girls and students of color.” × Expand Laura Zastrow Fred Willis — The playmaker Former Wisconsin Badgers football player Fred Willis can pinpoint the exact moment he realized that his heart wasn’t in the game. He was in the locker room with his teammates before the 2011 Big 10 conference home opener against Nebraska — a huge game versus a brand-new rival — and the players were swept up in an impassioned pep talk by one of the coaches. “[The coach] was so pumped up, and everybody was so geeked,” Willis recalls. “He looks around and starts yelling, ‘Everybody’s been waiting for a moment like this all their lives, right?’” The players roared their agreement, but the question gave Willis, then a freshman wide receiver, pause. Unlike his teammates, many of whom had been training since elementary school, he hadn’t been waiting his whole life for that moment — in fact, he had only been playing football for a few years when college recruiters started calling. “Literally everybody was like, ‘Hell yes!’” Willis remembers. “And I was there just thinking, ‘Maybe I’m in the wrong place.’” Willis hung up his jersey in August 2012 — a move that cost him a full-ride scholarship to UW-Madison. Struggling to pay for school and unsure what career path to pursue, he eventually dropped out, entering what he calls his “free-fall” phase. He dabbled in graphic design, videography, studied financial planning and eventually decided to teach himself computer programming. Willis, whose decision to quit football stemmed in part from a desire to have more control over his time, saw web development as a good opportunity for him to earn a living while working independently and being his own boss. “I needed something that fit into my schedule, but I didn’t have $19,000 to spend on a three-month [coding program],” says Willis, who then enrolled in a part-time web developer course that was offered online. Within a month, he had mastered the basics of Ruby on Rails, a widely used full-stack language, and built his first website, a simple blog. “It wasn’t hard for me to pick up at all,” says Willis, noting that he’s always been a bit of a natural with computers and technology and that there are a number of other “techies” in his family. “I didn’t learn everything, but I went straight for the core.” In June, Willis, now 23, launched his business, Hacknvest, which combines his specialties: web development and financial investing. He builds software for his “strategic partners” in exchange for a percentage of their business, then he turns around and invests the capital to generate even more income. So far, he’s built relationships with local businesses like the Soap Opera and Dane Buy Local, as well as a number of financial companies and nonprofits. “I don’t really have clients [so much as] I try to build relationships with other business entities,” Willis says. Inspired by Warren Buffett, Willis’ investing skills are also self-taught. And he’s incorporated his tech skills into his strategy, building a “web scraping” program that harvests information on undervalued stocks, which he then considers when diversifying his portfolio. Eventually, his goal is to bring in five figures of business each month. He’s not quite there yet, but he says persistence, networking and continually learning new skills will help him land that “big breadwinner.” Though he’s found success as a programmer and enjoys being an entrepreneur, Willis says it isn’t just the work that he’s passionate about — it’s more about the freedom to make his own schedule and be his own boss that his independent venture allows. “I like the idea of having time and money,” Willis says. “It’s important for me to have a balance of both.” × Expand Laura Zastrow Kelly Ehlers — The socialite As president of a company that specializes in social media, Kelly Ehlers doesn’t exactly intend to fly under the radar. But her highly specialized niche business is rare in the world of marketing and advertising agencies.  “It was a real gamble focusing on social in the beginning,” says Ehlers, recalling the countless times potential clients said they could just have the intern do it. She always responded by asking, “Would you give your intern a microphone and let them be on the 6 o’clock news?” “That’s what it’s like if they’ve got the keys to your social media,” she says. “[Companies] are just now catching on to it.” Ehlers founded her agency, Ideas that Evoke, in 2009, in the midst of the recession and a time of massive upheaval in technology, media and communication. Ehlers was also pregnant with her first child, and her husband had just lost his job. “My husband and I decided to sort of put all our chips on the table,” she says. At that point in the late 2000s, the concept of social media as an e-commerce and communication tool was only just beginning to take shape. Blogging emerged as a platform for brands and influencers, Facebook for businesses became available and widely used, and Twitter was beginning its meteoric rise as a direct marketing and communication device. Technology like Instagram, Snapchat, Periscope and Facebook Live weren’t even in the picture yet.  Especially in those early years, companies didn’t quite understand the nascent technology —  let alone how to harness its potential. But Ehlers, who was working at a traditional advertising agency at the time, took notice that some of the big, international brands were starting to “dip their toes in the water” of social media. She was fascinated — and hooked. “It was kind of opportunistic,” she says. “I thought, ‘Let’s just see where this goes.’” At first, it took a lot of convincing on Ehlers’ part even to get companies to consider adding a line item in their budget for social media. Businesses understood things like print advertising, radio spots and billboards, but social media was an intangible — up until the point that it started proving its worth. “We can target messages exactly to [a demographic] and turn that lead into a sale,” Ehlers says. And when clients see results, “it’s magical to them.” Over the last seven years, Ehlers has transformed her one-woman agency into a bustling company with more than 30 employees. She hired her first employee four years ago, but the majority of the company’s growth happened in the past year and a half. She specializes in the beauty, lifestyle and luxury market, representing a number of international clients, including Elizabeth Arden and Proctor & Gamble. In 2015, Ideas that Evoke was named one of the best entrepreneurial companies in the nation by Entrepreneur magazine. This year, it landed a spot on Inc. Magazine’s list of the 500 fastest-growing private companies in the nation. It grew 1,000% in the last three years. Here in Madison, Ehlers is partnering with Mary Burke to launch a new initiative called “Building Brave,” a nonpolitical organization that launches this fall. The first event is set for September, but Ehlers can’t release many details, other than saying it will encourage people to step out of their comfort zones. “It’s all about lifestyle, wellness and professional development,” Ehlers says. “We’re bringing these things to other women, which is something I’m really passionate about.” × Expand Laura Zastrow Ted Gurman — The guru Ted Gurman isn’t your typical tech entrepreneur. He spends more time on a yoga mat than he does in front of a computer screen. “There’s absolutely nothing technical about anything I’ve ever done in my whole life,” he says with a laugh. But the lack of a technical background didn’t stop him from founding BlueTree Network, a health care information technology consulting firm that specializes in Epic software. Getting into consulting is a common next step for former Epic employees like Gurman, 36, who was a project manager for the health care software giant from 2006 to 2010. But Gurman, who founded BlueTree with fellow Epic graduate Reggie Luedtke, wanted to build something that was different from the traditional consulting firm. Established in 2012, the company has grown to employ nearly 250 people and has offices in Madison, Denver and New York City. About 180 employees work remotely at client sites. “It’s very common in the consulting world for folks to feel like they’re on an island, like they’re part of a company, but only by name,” says Gurman. “Once they’re done onboarding, done with their background check and done getting their insurance in place, they never hear from the company again.” Not so at BlueTree, where employees are affectionately known as “Blue Leaves.” The company’s philosophy is rooted in the idea of wellness, community-building and development — both professional and personal. From the start, Gurman made it his mission to make his holistic approach to health and mindfulness a central pillar of the company — he gave himself the title of “Minister of Happiness.”  “We find that when someone becomes a Blue Leaf, they want to continue working for us,” Gurman says. “It feels like a family.” The company has an advocacy program that matches new hires with mentors who are dedicated to help facilitate their “personal and professional happiness” at BlueTree, and the company’s structure is not hierarchical. Every employee gets a FitBit and is encouraged to participate in company-wide fitness challenges. Standing desks are available to anybody who wants one. There’s a BlueTree “Give Committee,” funded by a donation from the company’s annual budget and made up of volunteers who meet monthly to decide what kind of philanthropy or volunteer work they’d like to pursue. BlueTree holds volunteering events in the Madison community every two months, and it coordinates with the New York and Denver offices as well. And like many startups, BlueTree offers unlimited vacation — and Gurman makes sure people know that it’s acceptable (and expected) that employees take full advantage of the perk. “I think there’s a generational shift where millennials have different expectations for their work environment.

You’d better read the fine print if backing Exxon Mobil Corp. and British American Tobacco Plc isn’t your idea of doing good. QuickTake Sustainable Investing The oil company accused of misleading investors by hiding evidence about climate change and Europe’s biggest cigarette maker are among the holdings of some of the 30 biggest funds that invest following environmental or social governance guidelines, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. While some funds are strict about supporting only clean-energy producers, others buy securities from Big Oil to Big Tobacco along with consumer brands such as Unilever and Facebook Inc. The wide range of holdings is the result of each institution deciding on its own what meets the ethical threshold. Loosening that definition has helped ethical investing grow about 80 percent over the past five years to $223 billion, data compiled by Bloomberg show. “The industry hasn’t done itself many favors in making sure people understand what’s what,” said Charlie Thomas, who manages 950 million euros ($1 billion) under Jupiter’s Ecology funds, which exclude oil and tobacco in favor of companies that have a solution for environmental issues. “The challenge that we have as a sector is to be very clear with the investor so they know what they’re actually buying. Not all ethical funds are the same.” There’s no agreed definition on what an ethical fund should be. That has allowed to mushroom the number of funds saying they support companies guided by standards on environmental and social governance. There are no set criteria for how companies report performance on those metrics, and no regulator like the Securities and Exchange Commission has set out rules.  The looseness of the system is a concern to the Group of 20 nations, which asked a panel led by Bank of England Governor Mark Carney to draw up a proposal for voluntary reporting standards that companies could follow if they chose. That’s likely to offer best practices to companies and accounting firms that draw up sustainability reports and release data through organizations such as the non-profit CDP and Bloomberg. ESG fund strategies range from excluding only companies they score the worst in their industries on specific metrics to including only the best of their class. Some seek to spur change by working as activist shareholders. A few will invest only in companies that benefit the environment. The only way to tell the difference is to look at what the fund is holding. No Simple Label “There’s not a simple label you can slap on it to solve the problem,” said Greg Elders, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence in London tracking ESG data. “Clients think it’s a shortcut for seeing how sustainable a fund is.” The Bloomberg survey found the number of environmentally friendly or ESG funds has more than doubled in the past decade to about 730. Of the top 30, at least six hold oil companies. At Impax Asset Management Group, which runs a $568 million Environmental Markets fund, the number of companies that meet its rules has jumped to 1,500 from 250 in 1999, with the pool of firms eligible to be included growing to $4.1 trillion, according to Jon Forster, a portfolio manager at the firm. Investors have benefited from the diversification of green funds. The MSCI KLD 400 Social Index has risen more than 225 percent from the March 2009 low, about as much as the S&P 500 Index. The gauge includes 400 companies, with Microsoft Corp., Procter & Gamble Co. and Verizon Communications Inc. having the biggest weightings. Growth in the sustainable-fund business, regardless of how “green” some of its investments are, is set to continue. A boom in renewable energy investment along with tighter environmental rules and increasing interest from younger people are the main drivers, said Sarbjit Nahal, head of thematic investing at Bank of America Corp. in London. “The word I would stress is ‘mainstream,’” Nahal said. “There’s been a huge change towards taking longer-term issues into account. This is a space that you want to be in.” Here are some of the top 30 ESG funds that hold oil and tobacco: TIAA-CREF Social Choice Equity Fund, with $2.8 billion under management Tracks the U.S. stock market, giving “special consideration to certain social criteria,” according to the firm’s website. Holdings as of June included Occidental Petroleum Corp., Schlumberger Ltd., ConocoPhillips, Marathon Oil Corp. The fund’s approach is to “include companies that are ESG leaders among their industry and sector peers,” said Manica Piputbundit, an associate at TIAA Global Asset Management, which manages $889 billion including more than $18 billion in ESG funds. KLP AksjeGlobal Indeks I, a $3.7 billion fund Invests in stocks listed in developed markets in accordance to KLP’s guidelines for responsible investment. All coal and tobacco companies are excluded. Holdings include Exxon, BP Plc, Monsanto Co. Exxon was excluded from 2004 until 2009, when it was involved in a bribery case. The fund aims to achieve “positive change through active ownership,” said Annie Bersagel, responsible investment adviser at KLP. DNB Global Indeks, a $1.4 billion fund Avoids companies responsible for “grave harm to the environment” and that don’t meet DNB’s “minimum ethical requirements,” according to its website. Holdings include Exxon, Chevron Corp. and mining giant BHP Billiton Ltd. Weapons, tobacco and pornography companies are excluded, as well as those miners and power producers that get 30 percent or more of their income from coal. ACTIAM NV’s $1.3 billion Responsible Index Fund Tracks the MSCI North America Index, investing “exclusively in shares that meet the ESG criteria, as formulated by ACTIAM,” according to its website. Holdings include British American Tobacco and Royal Dutch Shell Plc. Weapon producers are among the companies excluded. “There are a some products or activities that directly lead to exclusion without prior engagement, but otherwise we see exclusion as a last resort,” Maxime Molenaar, an ESG analyst at ACTIAM, said in an e-mail response to questions. “We would first try to achieve improvements in the companies’ behavior.” Pax World Management LLC, which manages ESG funds including the $1.9 billion Pax Balanced Fund The Balanced Fund selects the best assets from a social and environmental perspective relative to their peers, according to Pax Chief Executive Officer Joseph Keefe, who said he doesn’t see the need for more definitive criteria in ESG investing. Holdings include Occidental Petroleum because of its high ESG ranking, based on Pax’s analysis. “There are a variety of strategies within sustainable investing funds because there are a variety of issues that investors care about,” Keefe said. “You want to design diversified portfolios to provide investors with the opportunity to achieve market or above-market return.” Amundi Asset Management’s Atout Euroland $1.4 billion fund. Its goal is to outperform the MSCI Euro Index by investing at least 75 percent of its assets in euro-zone stocks based on socially-responsible and ESG criteria, in addition to financial criteria, according to the fund’s prospectus. Amundi goes by “best-in-class strategies” rather than banning specific industries, and excludes the worst ESG-rated companies in each of them, the firm said in an e-mailed response to questions. Holdings include Shell and Repsol SA. “A policy of investing in the most efficient and least polluting issuers and avoiding the least efficient, for example, encourages companies and sectors to improve working practices and should reward investors through exposure to the best managed businesses,” a media representative for the firm said. “Blanket bans switch off dialogue and reduce incentives for managements to change.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Blog :  Female Tech Exec from India Shares ‘Reality’ of Silicon Valley Article :  Gain More Control of BYOD Apps with an Enterprise App Store HP Inc: Surprisingly Good Financial Results That Shouldn’t Have Been Surprising Rob Enderle |   Unfiltered Opinion   |   Posted 24 Aug, 2016          |         |     Share HP Inc., the version of HP that sells personal computers, tablets and printers, reported strong results this quarter, but behind these results are three key elements. First, the firm has a relatively stable and experienced executive team. Second, it is very focused on a limited number of segments. And third, it appears to be out-marketing every other firm in its segment. Oh, and it has one huge potential killer product in its 3D printer, which is now shipping to key customers like Rolls Royce. Cars in this class have a high percentage of very unique parts, making them an ideal candidate for a production level 3D printer like HP Inc.’s. Let’s talk about the pillars that support HP Inc.’s strong financial results. Stable/Loyal/Experienced Executive Team From the standpoint of staffing, when HP split into two parts, HPE and HP Inc., it was clear that HP Inc. made out like a bandit in executive staff. Each of the top executives had decades of experience in the industry. In two critical areas, Finance and HR, these people represented some of the best in the industry. Even the CEO, while new to the position, was deeply experienced with personal computers and came to the job very highly regarded. This creates a foundation of stability and excellence that bleeds down through the organization. Until recently, most of the HP folks I know who left the firm would never even consider going back. There has been a wave of returning HP folks to HP Inc. and they talk about the company as if it were young, vibrant and very different from the HP they left. Successful companies are often defined by stability, loyalty and experience. This foundational concept was showcased in the financials this week. Focused Strategy for HP Inc. A lot of technology companies are suffering as they attempt to pivot to new industries and opportunities while trying to maintain the revenue streams that pay the bills. HP Inc. doesn’t really have this problem at the moment. PCs and Printers was and remains a relatively focused market, and while both segments appear to be in decline, the theoretical causes of the PC decline, tablets and smartphones, are themselves in trouble. Printing is in decline, but the rate is very slow and people don’t like change so they are holding on to printing for some things. And HP continues to innovate here so its supply numbers, while weakening, remain surprisingly strong. Their printing pivot to 3D printing is now rolling into production and, unlike most composite 3D printers, which turn out prototypes that can’t be used in production, HP Inc.’s printed parts are in many cases usable in final products. This is likely why companies like Rolls Royce are using them. This one line has massive upside potential and while the printers are just ramping out of test runs to production runs, they could be a powerful foundation for growth come 2017. Marketing at HP Inc. Marketing is one of those things that makes me wonder how many tech CEOs actually attended business school, or paid attention to the marketing classes while there. Currently, a good chunk of the cause of the technology downturn is a distinct lack of demand generation for the related products. HP Inc. is the counterpoint to this, as it appears to be outspending and out-executing every other company in its segment, and this likely also speaks to why its results were so strong. What makes HP so unique is that a number of key players have marketing backgrounds that are surprisingly broad. Antonio J. Lucio traces back through PepsiCo and Procter & Gamble, which is surprisingly deep for a tech CMO. Ron Coughlin, who heads Personal Systems, was the CMO for Pepsi and has degrees in marketing. This likely explains why the firm is out-executing its peers in terms of demand; it not only has one of the strongest CMOs from the standpoint of experience, but the guy running Personal Systems has a very similar background and he controls a good chunk of the marketing budget. Having experience and understanding for marketing in operational roles is something we haven’t really seen since Steve Jobs’ death, and HP Inc.’s results showcase why this is important. Wrapping Up: Foundations of Success at HP Inc. There is a foundation for success in a company. It starts with a stable, loyal qualified executive team, followed by a lack of complexity in the business model and the requisite focus. Finally, the company needs adequate marketing skills and resources so that the team not only knows what to do, but can afford to do it. This is all highlighted in HP Inc.’s financial results. I should add that I watch two people closely who represent the best of what they do: Cathie Lesjak, the CFO, who was known at HP for pretty much being right every time; and Tracy Keogh, the most experienced HR manager I’ve met since the 1970s or when HR was last treated as a true profession, not just a compliance organization. In the end, HP Inc. is the part of HP I’m no longer worried about, for good reason.

Off the Street Video Research Politics World Science Policy Tech Energy Religion Defense Sports Recent Videos Advertisement: August 25, 2016 Treasury's Regulatory Overstep Attempts to Fix the Wrong ProblemBy William Shughart When Washington intervenes in the economy to "fix" a perceived problem, more often than not it ends up causing more confusion and doing more harm than good. Take the Treasury Department's sweeping new "earnings-stripping" regulations designed to stop so-called inversions, a rational business strategy allowing U.S.-based companies to recover some of the competitive advantages they have lost because America imposes the highest combined federal, state and local corporate tax rates on the planet (among OECD countries, only France comes close). By merging with a foreign corporation and moving its headquarters to another country with a lower tax rate, U.S. companies can raise their after-tax earnings, thus supplying the wherewithal for more investment, expanded production and additional hiring. Calling inversions unpatriotic and contributing to capital "flight" - sending investment and jobs overseas - the U.S. Treasury has been pushing new regulations in recent months to make it more difficult for businesses to avoid paying their "fair" share of the taxes flowing into governmental coffers. Previously announced "reforms" did little to stop businesses from pulling up stakes here at home and moving to friendlier tax environments, so Treasury buckled down in April and proposed new regulations under Section 385 of the Internal Revenue Code. Those regulations would empower the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to classify how related-party interests in a corporation can be treated as income rather than debt. The significance? Bigger corporate tax bills. Despite being rolled out with some fanfare - including a host of laudatory comments from President Obama - financial institutions, business groups, accounting firms and both parties on Capitol Hill have been unimpressed, arguing that the new regulations go too far, overturn long-standing tax case law and upend foundational tax principles. As a result, businesses not even contemplating inversions will find themselves paying higher taxes for simply managing inter-company debt transactions. News flash: businesses do not pay income taxes, only people (owners, employees, suppliers and customers) do. The corporate tax burden is shifted backward and forward in various ways depending on the nature of the industry in which the company operates. Moreover, corporate income is taxed twice: once at the level of the firm and then again at the level of individual shareholders when distributed to them as dividends. Any increases in the market value of the corporation (capital gains) are taxed when investors sell their shares. Recognizing these other taxes on corporate incomes, a principled argument can be made that the "optimal" corporate income tax rate is zero. Even if one is not willing to go that far, extensive analysis conducted by Ernst and Young concluded that, "The proposed regulations reach well beyond the inversion transactions that may have been their primary impetus; they extend to routine financing transactions for both non-US-based and US-based multinational corporations, for some majority-owned subsidiaries, for private equity funds and their portfolio companies, and for taxable real estate investment trust subsidiaries." In addition, "if finalized in their current form, the proposed regulations would dramatically affect a wide range of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) transactions and ordinary course [of business] corporate finance and tax operations." Alarmingly, some companies, such as Procter & Gamble, estimate that compliance with the new regulations would raise their annual operating costs by between $220 and $340 million. Earnings that otherwise would go to hiring new employees, investing in research and development or inventing new products and services instead will by sucked up by the federal government. After a three-month public comment period during which myriad commentators - individual taxpayers, large and small businesses, economists, accountants and former government officials - weighed in on the changes, a senior Treasury official was forced to concede that the proposal was a "blunt instrument [that] might have overdone it." The problem isn't inversions, it's our overly complex, anti-growth, anti-investment corporate tax code. And the simplest and most effective way of fixing the problem is bringing U.S. corporate tax rates more in line with our global competitors. Do that and inversions will stop without resorting to more regulations and hiring more IRS agents to enforce them.   William F. Shughart II, research director of the Independent Institute, is J.

Apple will purchase the electricity generated by the plant to power its stores in California. Credit Andrew Burton for The New York Times PALO ALTO, Calif. — The words are stenciled on the front of the Apple Store, a glass box sandwiched between a nondescript Thai restaurant and a CVS pharmacy in downtown Palo Alto: “This store runs on 100 percent renewable energy.” If Apple’s plans play out, it will be able to make that claim not only for its operations throughout California but also beyond, as the company aims to meet its growing needs for electricity with green sources like solar, wind and hydroelectric power. Like other big companies before it, including Walmart and Google, Apple recently received a federal designation for its energy subsidiary that allows it to become a wholesale seller of electricity from coast to coast. In effect, Apple is creating its own green utility company, although the main customer is itself. The motives may be economic as much as they are environmental. As a wholesaler, Apple could reduce the cost of its electricity load, which reached 831 million kilowatt-hours in the last fiscal year — enough to power about 76,000 homes for a year. But like a growing number of corporations, Apple is intent on reducing carbon dioxide emissions from electricity production — one of the biggest sources of greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming. Continue reading the main story Advertisement Continue reading the main story In one ambitious venture, Apple has contracted with First Solar to begin buying a little less than half of the power later this year from California Flats, a solar energy farm now under construction. Under the terms of the deal, Apple will pay $848 million for the electricity over 25 years and receive the farm’s total output by the end of the agreement. It is one of largest commercial clean energy contracts yet. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Lisa Jackson, the former administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency who is now the Apple executive overseeing environmental policy, social initiatives and worldwide government affairs, said she hoped Apple could serve as a model for the many other big corporate power users that are now embracing clean energy. “This is just another sort of innovative way to get that power onto the grid so we don’t have to take the California grid-mix default, which still includes fossil fuel,” Ms. Jackson said. Although much of Apple’s manufacturing is done offshore, it still has extensive needs for electric power in the United States — and not only for the sprawling new corporate campus it is building at its headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., and its 270 retail stores around the country. One of Apple’s biggest demands for electricity comes from operating the computing cloud through which it sells apps, music and videos to users of its iPhones, iPads and Mac computers. Apple’s move comes as prices for renewable energy continue to plummet. And signing long-term contracts allows businesses to shield themselves from potentially higher, more volatile charges from a power company. Apple would not say how much it was paying for California Flats’s energy, but Ms. Jackson said last year at a Wall Street Journal conference that it was less than what it paid for commercial power. She said she expected the company to save hundreds of millions of dollars over the life of the contract. Google, which received its federal energy wholesale designation from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in 2010, is a big proponent of the approach Apple is now taking. “Running any kind of business, having predictability in terms of your operating costs can be very important,” said Gary Demasi, director of operations for data center energy and location strategy at Google, which has been a leading investor in and user of clean energy. “Renewable energy, from a cost perspective, is now competitive with other forms of energy, much more so than it was a few years ago.” In the United States, the generating capacity of corporate clean energy projects has more than doubled each year since 2013, according to the Business Renewables Center at the Rocky Mountain Institute, which tracks publicly announced deals. In 2015, 11 companies signed up for 3.23 gigawatts’ worth of projects, roughly the equivalent of five coal plants and up from 1.18 gigawatts the year before. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Executives face greater pressure from shareholders and customers to show that they are doing their part to fight climate change. At the same time, corporate energy use has exploded, driven in many cases by the ravenous demands of the data cloud. “We are all becoming very large energy players, and this is a shift,” said Brian Janous, director of energy strategy at Microsoft. “Energy is not something that Microsoft or Amazon or Google really ever had to think much about prior to the advent of the cloud.” Photo Newly installed rotator hinges at the First Solar plant will allow the panels to rotate with the sun. Credit Andrew Burton for The New York Times Helping drive that shift are environmental groups like the World Resources Institute. In May, it helped create the Renewable Energy Buyers Alliance, a coalition of nonprofits that has more than 60 corporations in its network, including McDonald’s and General Motors, as well as Google and Walmart Journalism that matters. More essential than ever. Subscribe to the Times Electric utilities have begun to respond by creating products and services to meet the corporate demand for clean energy, said Letha Tawney, the World Resources Institute’s director of utility innovation. One such product is a green tariff. It was pioneered in North Carolina by Duke Energy and is now under consideration in about a dozen states. It allows companies to designate that they are paying for a renewable energy supply. Another is a synthetic or virtual power purchase agreement, under which companies contract to buy the output of a clean power plant, as Apple is doing with California Flats. Although the companies say these arrangements mean they are running their businesses on renewable energy, in reality the clean power often does not flow directly to their facilities. They typically buy the renewable energy in amounts to match what they draw from the grid — a system of swaps that Ms. Jackson of Apple likened to using an A.T.M. “The dollar you deposit in the bank might not be the exact same bill that you get out,” she said. Robert F. Shapiro, a partner at the law firm Chadbourne & Parke who focuses on project finance and energy, describes it as meaningful symbolism. Advertisement Continue reading the main story “They’re actually getting power from their local utility, which may be coal,” Mr. Shapiro said. “But they’re deemed to have put into the world carbon-neutral energy, which they are deemed to have used for their load.” To keep track of the clean energy credits, power generators work with registries to issue numbered certificates. “The power flows into the grid. The electrons go where they go,” Ms. Tawney said. “But because there’s a renewable-energy certificate, no one else can claim the same zero-carbon benefit.” Such complexities are necessary, executives and clean energy advocates say, because it is not often feasible to install enough renewable-power generators at corporate sites to meet companies’ full energy needs. Walmart, despite having installed solar panels, wind turbines and fuel cells at stores and distribution centers, can nonetheless meet only about a third of those operations’ energy needs. So it also buys renewable energy from generators and utilities, said David Ozment, director of energy at Walmart stores. Procter & Gamble, another member of the energy buyers’ alliance, has arranged to purchase all of the steam from a biomass generator under construction at a plant in Georgia where it makes Charmin toilet paper and Bounty paper towels, said Jack McAneny, the company’s director of sustainability. But that was possible, he said, only because of the plant’s location near a source of waste wood and pulp for fuel and the cooperation of P&G’s partners. Among those partners are the local utility, Georgia Power, which will buy the electricity from the generator for its customers from Constellation, the company that developed and will own and operate the generator. At Apple, where the purchase or production of renewable energy has more than tripled since 2012, the company would prefer to not have to go to great lengths to ensure a clean energy supply, Ms. Jackson said. But the public energy grid is simply still too dependent on carbon-based fuels to make that possible. “If we had our preference, we’d just be able to say, ‘We want 100 percent green power everywhere we use power,’” Ms. Jackson said. “The best would be if we could run every one of our stores, every one of our data centers, every office complex, every building we have, on 100 percent renewable — and if we didn’t have to spend a whole bunch of our time and energy figuring out how to get that done.” A version of this article appears in print on August 24, 2016, on page B1 of the New York edition with the headline: Creating Their Own Green Sources.

SCA is Europe's biggest private owner of forests. Its hygiene business is the world's largest maker of incontinence pads and No.2 in consumer tissues such as napkins and toilet paper. Its forestry arm produces paper, pulp and wood products. "This is what everybody has been waiting for," said Evli Bank analyst Markku Jarvinen. "The businesses are clearly very different from an investment standpoint. The forest business is low return on capital, very stable, and the hygiene business is high return on capital." SCA shares jumped as much as 13 percent to a new high of 281.90 crowns, giving it a market value of about $23 billion. SCA said in August last year it would merge its forest land and forest products businesses into one division, leading many analysts then to expect a split-up of the group. The company said on Wednesday a separate listing for its hygiene arm, whose brands include Libero, Libresse, Nosotras, Saba and TENA, would "create more shareholder value and incur relatively low transactional risk and relatively low transaction costs", compared with alternative ways of splitting the group. Shares in forestry firm Holmen, which analysts have identified as a potential buyer or partner for SCA's forest products business, rose 6 percent. Holmen is controlled by Fredrik Lundberg, the Swedish business magnate who is also chairman of SCA's biggest shareholder, Swedish investment firm Industrivarden. Industrivarden and SCA's No.2 shareholder, Norway's sovereign wealth fund, said they backed the planned separation, which will be voted on at SCA's 2017 annual general meeting. They control 29.8 and 8.7 percent of votes respectively. Betting on strong long-term growth for hygiene products, SCA has in recent years expanded this business to account for about 85 percent of sales and cut back its paper and other wood products businesses. The company said on Wednesday a break-up would leave it better placed to succeed in both business areas. SCA, which was founded in 1929 and competes with Procter & Gamble and Kimberly-Clark, said it planned to list the hygiene business in the second half of 2017 under a new name. The company makes the bulk of its sales in Europe, where it expects an ageing population to boost demand for incontinence products. It is also expanding in emerging markets, expecting rising incomes there to lift demand for hygiene products. SCA was thrust into the spotlight in 2014 when Swedish media uncovered a corporate spending scandal that prompted the CEO to resign and led to a change of guard at Industrivarden.

At 12:17 IST, the Sensex was down 13.75 points or 0.05% at 27,976.46. The Nifty was currently up 2.25 points or 0.03% at 8,634.85. The Sensex was currently trading below the psychologically important 28,000 level after reclaiming that level at the onset of trading session. It had settled a tad below that level during the previous trading session. The Sensex lost 14.53 points or 0.05% at the day's low of 27,975.68 in early afternoon trade. The barometer index rose 118.18 points or 0.42% at the day's high of 28,108.39 at the onset of trading session, its highest level since 22 August 2016. The Nifty rose 1.05 points or 0.01% at the day's low of 8,633.65 in early afternoon trade. The index rose 28.45 points or 0.32% at the day's high of 8,661.05 at the onset of trading session, its highest level since 22 August 2016. In overseas stock markets, Asian stocks witnessed a mixed trend ahead of Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen's speech later this week, which could provide hints about the timing of the next rate hike from the Fed. US stocks registered small gains yesterday, 23 August 2016, after upbeat data on US new-home sales. Yellen is due to speak on Friday 26 August 2016, at the Kansas City Fed's annual Monetary Policy Symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) July meeting showed officials were split on whether an increase in interest rate was needed soon. In Europe, the latest data showed that Germany's economy slowed in the second quarter, as investment dropped after a strong start to the year. Germany's gross domestic product grew at a quarterly rate of 0.4%, or an annualized rate of 1.7%, according to the Federal Statistical Office, Destatis. The economy expanded at a quarterly clip of 0.7% in the first quarter. Closer home, the market breadth indicating the overall health of the market was strong. On BSE, 1,457 shares rose and 914 shares declined. A total of 176 shares were unchanged. The BSE Mid-Cap index was currently up 0.44%. The BSE Small-Cap index was currently up 0.49%. Both these indices outperformed the Sensex. FMCG stocks edged higher. Britannia Industries (up 3.41%), Godrej Consumer Products (up 1.95%), Tata Global Beverages (up 1.76%), Colgate-Palmolive (India) (up 1.33%), Emami (up 0.43%), Jyothy Laboratories (up 1.23%), Marico (up 0.54%), Procter & Gamble Hygiene and Health Care (up 0.9%), Nestle India (up 0.72%), Dabur India (up 0.36%), and Bajaj Corp (up 0.78%) gained. Hindustan Unilever (down 1.23%) and GlaxoSmithkline Consumer Healthcare (down 0.68%) edged lower. Realty stocks also rose. D B Realty (up 1.08%), Indiabulls Real Estate (up 1.02%), Unitech (up 0.78%), Godrej Properties (up 0.85%), DLF (up 0.98%) and Housing Development & Infrastructure (up 0.21%) edged higher. Oberoi Realty (down 1.05%), Sobha (down 0.6%) and Prestige Estates Projects (down 0.27%) edged lower. State Bank of India (SBI) was up 0.06% at Rs 254.75 after a committee of directors of the bank approved an enabling resolution to raise upto Rs 11100 crore additional Tier 1 capital by way of issue of Basel III compliant perpetual debt instrument in dollar or rupee terms, at par, through private placement to overseas and/or Indian investors in tranches. Indian Oil Corporation surged 3.89% to Rs 564.15 after the company said that its board of directors will consider issue of bonus shares along with Q1 June 2016 results on 29 August 2016. The announcement was made during market hours today, 24 August 2016. Welspun India was locked at 10% lower circuit at Rs 59.30 on reports that Wal-Mart Stores Inc. is reviewing the company's cotton certification records following Target Corp.'s decision to snap ties with the Indian textile maker over a cotton supply dispute. Walmart is Welspun's third-largest customer, behind Target. Target Corporation, one of Welspun's biggest clients, severed business ties with it earlier this week on charges that Welspun used cheaper quality cotton while supplying bed sheets between August 2014 and July 2016 without Target having any knowledge of this substitution. Target had pulled sheets and pillowcases off its shelves after discovering they were mislabeled as Egyptian cotton after a probe was initiated by it. Shares of Welspun India had hit 20% lower circuit in last two sessions following Target's announcement on Friday, 19 August 2016 of snapping ties with the company after violation of Target's code of conduct and standards of vendor engagement. Reports also suggest that US apparel and home furnishings retailer J. C. Penney Company, Inc. is investigating Welspun's products in the wake of the issue.

The Business Times Print Singapore's move to build a pipeline of global-ready talent and corporate leaders is picking up pace. On Tuesday, NTUC and the Economic Development Board tied up for the first time to launch a programme to provide promising young executives international exposure. Separately, trade promotion agency International Enterprise Singapore also said that it has awarded 13 scholarships to groom the next generation of talent to take on an international portfolio. The tie-up programme between the labour movement and the investment promotion body, the U Future Leaders Global Programme, "aims to identify young and promising Singaporeans from participating organisations, provide them with international exposure and opportunities to build key leadership attributes and develop relevant competencies" that could move them up the corporate ladder fast. It also aims to get more MNCs to groom aspiring Singaporeans to helm future leadership roles. NTUC said in a press release that the programme is open to companies which are part of its U Circle of Friends. Six MNCs which have made Singapore their regional headquarters are in the pilot programme. They are Dentsu Aegis Network, Diageo, Mastercard Asia Pacific, Procter & Gamble, Unilever and Yum! Asia Franchise. The need to encourage Singapore talent to gain overseas experience was pushed for in a Future Leaders Summit last year by NTUC chief Chan Chun Sing. This has been underscored in a study by Linkedln and NTUC, which found more than half of the corporate executives covered in the study have worked or studied abroad. The IE scholarships were given under its Young Talent (YTP) and Undergraduate Scholarship programmes - eight for the YTP and five for the undergraduate programme. The YTP was launched in 2013 and has 16 industry partners, with six which just came on board. This article was first published on Aug 24, 2016. Get The Business Times for more stories.

SCA is Europe's biggest private owner of forests. Its hygiene business is the world's largest maker of incontinence pads and No.2 in consumer tissues such as napkins and toilet paper. Its forestry arm produces paper, pulp and wood products. "This is what everybody has been waiting for," said Evli Bank analyst Markku Jarvinen. "The businesses are clearly very different from an investment standpoint. The forest business is low return on capital, very stable, and the hygiene business is high return on capital." SCA shares jumped as much as 13 percent to a new high of 281.90 crowns, giving it a market value of about $23 billion. SCA said in August last year it would merge its forest land and forest products businesses into one division, leading many analysts then to expect a split-up of the group. The company said on Wednesday a separate listing for its hygiene arm, whose brands include Libero, Libresse, Nosotras, Saba and TENA, would "create more shareholder value and incur relatively low transactional risk and relatively low transaction costs", compared with alternative ways of splitting the group. Shares in forestry firm Holmen, which analysts have identified as a potential buyer or partner for SCA's forest products business, rose 6 percent. Holmen is controlled by Fredrik Lundberg, the Swedish business magnate who is also chairman of SCA's biggest shareholder, Swedish investment firm Industrivarden (INDUa.ST). Industrivarden and SCA's No.2 shareholder, Norway's sovereign wealth fund, said they backed the planned separation, which will be voted on at SCA's 2017 annual general meeting. They control 29.8 and 8.7 percent of votes respectively. Betting on strong long-term growth for hygiene products, SCA has in recent years expanded this business to account for about 85 percent of sales and cut back its paper and other wood products businesses. The company said on Wednesday a break-up would leave it better placed to succeed in both business areas. SCA, which was founded in 1929 and competes with Procter & Gamble (PG.N) and Kimberly-Clark (KMB.N), said it planned to list the hygiene business in the second half of 2017 under a new name. The company makes the bulk of its sales in Europe, where it expects an ageing population to boost demand for incontinence products. It is also expanding in emerging markets, expecting rising incomes there to lift demand for hygiene products. SCA was thrust into the spotlight in 2014 when Swedish media uncovered a corporate spending scandal that prompted the CEO to resign and led to a change of guard at Industrivarden.

Jose Cuervo postpones IPO as Trump election roils Mexico: sources Jose Cuervo, the world's biggest tequila producer, has put its initial public offering on hold following the U.S. presidential election of Donald Trump, which has weighed on Mexican stocks and currency, according to people familiar with the matter on Wednesday.

Black Friday Tech Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Holiday Gifts Cyber Monday     DWTS Announces First Star Posted: Aug 23 2016, 7:46pm CDT | by Noel Diem, in News | Latest Celebrity News   Photo Credit: Getty Images   She's continuing a (somewhat) family tradition. According to E! News, Amber Rose will be joining Dancing with the Stars for the upcoming 23rd season. There has been confirmation from multiple sources that the talk show host/model/actress/author/activist is the latest star to sign up for the reality competition and will compete for the Mirrorball Trophy. Don't Miss: Hatchimals Deals on Amazon.com ABC does not comment on casting decisions, whether they are true or not, but the full lineup will come in an announcement on Good Morning American on August 30.  It was previously reported that there are other celebs in talk for this season that run the gamut of the entertainment industry - and sometimes stretch the meaning of the word "star." They include reigning Bachelorette JoJo Fletcher and former Wizards of Waverly Place and The Fosters star Jake T. Austin. There were reports that Olympian Simone Biles would be joining the cast, but she has made it clear that she probably won't be able to do it thanks to her gymnastics obligations and the Kellogg's Tour. "I would love to do Dancing with the Stars, but so far we have a three-month tour after this Olympics," Simone said at the P&G Family Home in Rio. "I'm not sure if I'll have time." However, fans of the gymnast shouldn't give up hope. She thinks that the show will be a great way to wind down after winning four golds and a bronze in the Rio Olympics. "I would really love to do it in the spring if that's possible," she added. Many other gymnasts have competed, including teammate Aly Raisman, Shawn Johnson, who won season eight, and fellow All-Around champion Nastia Liukin. Dancing with the Stars season 23 premieres Monday, Sept. 12 at 8 p.m. on ABC.

Foys has also instructed parishes of the diocese to conduct a second monetary collection in support of these efforts during the weekend of Sept. 10-11. In a press release, the diocese asks church members to be "as generous as you can to help your fellow brothers and sisters affected by the Louisiana floods." Monetary donations can be sent directly to the Diocese of Covington, Diocesan Stewardship and Mission Services, 1125 Madison Ave., Covington, KY 41011-3115. Questions? Call 859-392-1500.

Muench, former bishop of the Covington diocese. CINCINNATI.COM Red Cross seeks 'virtual volunteers' to aid Louisiana Donated items will be collected by volunteers and transported to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul facility in Crescent Springs and then sent on to the dioceses of Louisiana for distribution to those most affected by the flood. Matthew 25: Ministries based in Greater Cincinnati is in Louisiana responding to the flooding. Matthew 25: Ministries’ Disaster Response Team left on Aug. 17 with Matthew 25’s specialized Disaster Relief Vehicles. Joined by the Tide Loads of Hope mobile laundry unit, the trucks are loaded with over 8,000 pounds of relief supplies including P&G Comforts of Home personal care kits. The trucks will also be distributing Cintas first aid and safety kits and supplies, and additional items such as Pampers diapers, Charmin toilet paper and Tide Pods. The team will travel throughout the region, establishing central distribution sites and also delivering products to hard-hit areas. “The current disaster represents historic flooding in this area,” said Matthew 25 CEO Tim Mettey. “Our team has traveled to Louisiana a number of times since Hurricane Katrina in 2005. We have relationships in this area that we are committed to. We feel it is important for us to return to the area and to assist with recovery in every way we can.” Over 40,000 homes have been affected by the flooding. Approximately 8,000 people remain in shelters and more than 30,000 people have been rescued from flood waters across south Louisiana. At least 13 people have died as a result of the flooding, the relief organization's website reported Tuesday. Matthew 25: Ministries is accepting monetary donations for disaster relief.

Parameswaran Photo: iStockphoto Erving Goffman was a Canadian-American sociologist and writer, considered “the most influential American sociologist of the twentieth century”. He was also a member of the sociology department at the University of California, Berkeley. He was the first sociologist to study the depiction of genders in advertisements. His book Gender Advertisements, published four decades ago, continues to be a classic on the subject. Collecting over 500 ads during the period 1950 to 1970, the author presented a vivid pictorial analysis of how genders are portrayed in US (and I suppose global) advertising. I had bought a copy of the book through Amazon.com’s used bookseller network at significant cost seven years ago and in a book talk at the Institute of Media Studies in Pune, I was politely reminded that it is now easily available as a PDF. How things have changed! One of the anchor concepts that Goffman speaks about is ‘hyper-ritualization’ of gender stereotypes in print advertisements. Men were portrayed as taller and stronger. Women were always more dainty, smaller, softer. The analysis even pointed out how in most ads the man tends to tower over the women (check this out the next time you are browsing a magazine). The book continues to be relevant and numerous academic studies have followed along that tread the same path. I have also done my bit of analysis of how women are portrayed in Indian packaged goods advertising and presented a paper at an Association for Consumer Research conference in Beijing. As we see more and more stereotypical gender roles portrayed in advertising, we are also seeing new roles being envisaged for husband, wife, brother, sister. I call this phenomenon ‘neo-visualization’. One of the early proponents of this type of advertising was the Airtel ‘woman boss’ ad that was aired two years ago. In that ad, the woman is the boss and the husband is the subordinate who is struggling at office as she calls it a day. She does not visit a spa after work, but heads home to do some innovative cooking. The ad got criticized for presenting the woman in a stereotypical role. What the critics failed to probably notice was that she was enjoying the cooking process—call it the Masterchef effect. If Airtel questioned one set of roles, Procter & Gamble with its Ariel ad is trying to address a bigger problem of gender roles. In the long-format ad that I saw on YouTube (which incidentally is one of the top five most watched video ads in the country), it is the father of the girl who is regretting how he has neglected playing a meaningful role in the running of the household. His wife did the cooking, cleaning, washing, etc., as he went to work and came back to read the newspaper. He regrets that his daughter has been brainwashed to believe that it is her duty to do all that, though she is no longer a homemaker, but is a successful business executive. The old man heads home and asks his wife to teach him how to load the washing machine. A start, he says, hoping that this will get his daughter to start demanding more attention to house work from her husband, and maybe kids. Why should cooking and cleaning be the preserve of women, especially if most of them are now pursuing successful careers? What is the reality in developed markets? In the US, it has been reported that in over 40% of the homes (with a couple living together), cooking is the primary job of the male of the household; 45% of them are in charge of grocery shopping; and over 40% are in charge of dropping the kids to school and picking them up. As I travel the country delivering my book (Nawabs Nudes Noodles, which looks at India through 50 years of advertising) talk, I use the above data to get the men in the audience to do a show of hands on cooking. How many of you men folk here know how to cook? And I have been pleasantly surprised that when it comes to an audience of under 30-year-olds, there is a fair number of hands going up. But if the audience is the 40-plus age cohort, the numbers are very few. You may call it the Masterchef effect, but I would call it a change in the gender role perception in a changing Indian society. Even the humble Prestige pressure cooker, which once tom-tommed its ‘gasket release system’ as the true sign of marital love, is singing a slightly different tune today with the husband (Abhishek Bachchan) cooking for his wife (Aishwarya Rai) with a modern pressure cooker! So it would be interesting to track this changing dialogue in television advertising over the next 10 years and see if, finally, Goffman’s theories get a new twist, from hyper-ritualization to neo-visualization.

Till now, it was focusing on price hikes and high margins to drive growth. Among the new steps, the company is altering the compensation structure of its frontline sales team. Sales people at the Swiss food giant's India arm will now be rewarded on their ability to drive volume growth — with an aim to take it to double digits — and gain market share for the company vis-a-vis simply driving sales on higher prices, which was the norm earlier. "Nestle's volumes here have consistently been under pressure with growth dipping in each of the company's four segments. The company has seen almost zero volume growth in the last four years," said Abneesh Roy, senior VP at Edelweiss Securities. "Spurts in these segments were largely driven by pricing." On closer look, volume growth in each of Nestle's four categories — milk products & nutrition, beverages, prepared dishes & cooking aids, and chocolate & confectionary, showed negative volume growth in 2015, with growth of prepared dishes & cooking aids being the worst hit (-60%) due to Maggi instant noodles being taken off shelves. Maggi accounted for around a third of Nestle India's revenues before the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) banned it in June last year for alleged food safety issues. After its relaunch in November, Maggi has grabbed 57% of the Rs 2,000-crore domestic instant noodles market, said the company. Before the ban, it commanded 80% market share."I think the intent for frontline sales structure is undergoing a change — there is a lot of focus on getting volume growth....on getting new products that we have put in the market on the shelf, on the performance of new products," Suresh Narayanan, chairman and MD, Nestle India told analysts. "For people in the organised trade, we are doing an incentive platform in terms of activation and merchandising." Arvind Singhal, founder of Technopak, said, "Chasing volume growth is the right strategy for Nestle. By simply increasing prices, they face the danger of becoming a premium player, while challengers such as Patanjali are launching lower-priced products to gain market share. Both HUL and P&G tried to play the value growth strategy but failed." To chase double-digit volume growth, the Nestle management has made the company more agile, enhanced inventory management and hastened product launches. It has launched 25 products across several categories in the past eight weeks with many more in the pipeline. It has also beefed up distribution by following a split distribution route (two salespersons will service a retailer).

Grey had been AOR on DirecTV, which is now part of the larger telecomms organization — and according to Kantar Media, the client spent at least $2 billion in measured media last year. An agency spokesperson writes, “Grey New York has had a staff reduction of a little over 1% primarily due to the AT&T/DirecTV move.  We’ve also had to rebalance our staff due to changes in our clients’ marketing priorities/spending on some accounts across departments.  These are very difficult decisions and we wanted to give people notice, provide severance and begin the process of seeing if there are job opportunities available at other WPP companies.” The Grey rep declined to elaborate further or name individuals who have left, but our sources claim that much of the DirecTV creative and production teams, along with several account executives, are no longer with the WPP shop. The 1 percent number would put the total affected in the low double digits. While DirecTV was a significant loss, Grey has also recorded several new business wins and account expansions in recent months including GSK, Marriott, Weber, Kellogg’s, Best Buy and P&G’s shaving brands. Grey London is currently hiring as well after winning retail giant Marks & Spencer. We know because one of our contacts is applying to work there, but don’t ask about starting salaries for junior copywriters. < Previous Article Next Article > Advertisement Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

Storytelling Empowers Veterans: The Ariel Group Announces Partnership with The Homefront Foundation, Inc. Posted on August 24, 2016 by Top News US Full Feed in Press Releases Conceptual image of a businessman holding big hammer The Ariel Group, a portfolio company of Renovus Capital Partners, said Monday that it has partnered with The Homefront Foundation, Inc. The Homefront Foundation helps veterans, service members, and first responders use storytelling techniques to reconnect and integrate back into their communities. Boston, MA (PRWEB) August 24, 2016 The Ariel Group LLC, a registered B Corporation and communication skills training company based in Lexington, Massachusetts, has partnered with The Homefront Foundation, a Tampa, Florida-based non-profit organization that helps veterans, service members, and first responders through storytelling. “The Ariel Group is delighted to collaborate with The Homefront Foundation on this important work,” says Sean Kavanagh, Ariel’s CEO. “We teach storytelling in corporate and higher education settings around the world and we were very pleased to meet Matt Fetterman in our program at Columbia and now be invited to see the power of stories for our returning veterans. We look forward to continued collaboration and to supporting the healing and connecting power of stories for the men and women who serve.” Founded in 2016 by Matt and Mark Fetterman, twin brothers who both served in the Navy, The Homefront Foundation helps veterans rehabilitate to life – both personally and professionally – through the power of storytelling. “As veterans return home from a deployment, a sleepless shift at the station or a disaster response effort, people expect them to seamlessly reintegrate into their work, their communities, and their families,” explains Matt Fetterman. “The stressors and challenges faced in doing this are what many will never fully understand. It is only through sharing and storytelling that we can begin to learn these lessons and discover more of who wears the uniform, carries the shield or serves on that front line. The mission of The Homefront Foundation aligns perfectly with Ariel’s interactive, theater-based approach to create a unique, much-needed service to these great men and women and those they serve.” Since its founding, The Ariel Group has worked with organizations that service communities for the greater good. Hoping to impact the non-profit world as strongly as the corporate world, The Ariel Group focuses outreach efforts on professions and agencies that rely on their communication skills to affect positive change on a fundamental, humane level. Other recent partnerships include The Acumen Fund, The United Nations and The Social Innovation Forum. “Our training creates the space for our veterans to tell the stories that are stitched into the fabric of who they are, and in doing so, there is a gained understanding of that specific piece of them that up until this point was most likely hidden,” says Meghan Zbikowski, Outreach Manager of The Ariel Group. “Providing this training and hearing these stories of those who serve our country is an absolute privilege. We look forward to the continued development our partnership with The Homefront Foundation and more importantly the profound value this work will bring to our veterans, their families and community.” About The Ariel Group Using best practices from actor training and adult learning, The Ariel Group helps business people make impactful interpersonal connections through emotional intelligence, self-awareness and dynamic communication skills. Our mission is to teach individuals at every level to communicate effectively and build empathetic relationships with each other, to help their organizations experience higher engagement, increase innovation, improve team dynamics and expand leadership pipelines. Clients include American Express, Capital One, Coca-Cola, Harvard Business School, Procter & Gamble, Thyssen-Krupp, and a diverse mix of Fortune 1000 corporations and major MBA programs.

About The Homefront Foundation The Homefront Foundation, a registered 501c3 nonprofit organization focused on teaching veterans and service members how to tell their story. By using The Ariel Group’s techniques, and developing their own structured approach, these stories can be therapeutic, serve as a coping strategy, and they allow for individuals to reconnect and build relationships in their communities, in their workplace, and most importantly, in their homes.
