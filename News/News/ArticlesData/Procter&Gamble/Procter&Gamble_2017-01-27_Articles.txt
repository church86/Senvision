The world of Galileo: Eight days in Italy to discover the science of the Renaissance Home The secret science in your home The secret science in your home 25 January 2017 Sponsored by Nappy tech: inspired by babies All you need to aim to create the driest, most comfortable nappies is a lab full of playing babies and some bright minds NOT many research facilities have walls decorated with giant bumble bees and paddling ducklings. Nor do they tend to distract their study subjects with colourful slides and miniature shopping trolleys. Pampers – the first brand to widely introduce disposable nappy technology – has been understanding the needs of parents and babies to create new innovation for over 50 years. At the P&G Nappy Research and Development Centre in Schwalbach, Germany, around 250 researchers, part of a global team of over 800 scientists, ranging from dermatologists and chemists to material engineers, are designing the nappies of the future. The creative power of this team has enabled P&G to file more than 5000 nappy-improving patents. Babies in motion: 3D scanning Disposable nappies have changed beyond measure since their beginnings in the late 1940s. Their chief purpose, however, remains the same: to minimise leaks and keep skin dry and healthy and babies comfortable. Advertisement To help achieve this, babies and toddlers are regularly invited to the child-friendly research suite at Schwalbach. The shape, fit and movement of their nappies are observed as they play. Detailed measurements are made in a large 3D scanner, consisting of 20 synchronised cameras arranged around a platform. Down the corridor is a specialised lab where dermatologists measure skin pH and loss of water from the skin as part of their efforts to minimise skin irritation. Researchers also give packets of nappies to 1,200 families a week. These may be experimental designs or existing products. Parents are asked to keep a diary of how each performs, detailing such things as leaks, shape changes and dryness and condition of the skin. This feedback is combined with the properties of materials in nappies, such as elasticity and absorbency, to create computer models of new designs. These are used to calculate the chances of a leak or excessive sagging, for example. “We can assess 20 virtual nappy prototypes and eliminate all but two or three,” says Dr Frank Wiesemann, P&G Principal Baby Care Scientist. “We then test those fully, rather than testing all 20.” Channelling innovation Schwalbach plays a key role in delivering major innovations in nappy design. Below the permeable sheet next to the baby’s skin, for example, most nappies have a polymeric “acquisition layer” that draws urine away from the skin. P&G’s scientists have added a second “distribution layer” to Pampers nappies, which disperses liquid around the nappy so it can be absorbed more efficiently. This is mostly made of cellulose, long thin fibres extracted from wood pulp. P&G treats them to create short “cross links” that strengthen the fibres (see graphic). This helps the nappy absorb quickly, even when a child sits on it when it’s full. Liquid flows along gaps between the closely bound cellulose strands which act like capillary tubes. “You need active distribution of the urine, whichever position the baby is in,” says senior P&G scientist Dr Ute Fröhlich. “Capillary forces between the cellulose fibres are high, so urine can move rapidly even against gravity.” Most of the liquid then passes to the absorbent core layer of the nappy. Until recently, the core of a Pampers nappy resembled those of some other brands: a mixture of cellulose and particles of super absorbent polymer capable of soaking up huge amounts of liquid relative to its own weight. The idea was that the cellulose initially soaks up the urine and the super absorbent polymer dries out the cellulose. However, it is impossible to dry out the cellulose completely, so urine can be released back under pressure. To deal with this, P&G developed a new super absorbent polymer that absorbs and distributes urine more quickly, allowing them to eliminate cellulose from the core. This has cut the weight of a single Pampers by around 5 grams, or 16 per cent, which is good for children. In a study funded by P&G, psychologists at New York University showed that, compared with cloth nappies, thin disposables help toddlers to keep their feet, reducing stumbles and falls. Some super absorbent polymers can take up hundreds of times their own weight in liquid, but P&G has constrained the new version to absorb between 20 and 30 times its weight. As a result, the particles do not merge into a single jelly-like blob. They stay as individual spheres even when saturated, so that any extra urine can flow past them to be absorbed elsewhere. Innovation doesn’t end there. Some nappies leak as a result of losing their shape when worn by active infants. To minimise this, P&G recently shaped the core into three absorbing channels to help the nappy keep its shape. Finally, faeces are trickier to deal with than urine. Clinical studies have shown that the enzymes in faeces can be aggressive on baby skin, especially when activated by high pH urines. So quick removal of faeces from the skin reduces risk of nappy rash. To improve performance, a Pampers Premium Protection nappy has a top sheet that has little conical apertures, allowing faeces to get into the core instead of spreading on top. This reduces faeces contact with the skin. “When I chose to study chemistry I didn’t set out to become a poo and wee expert,” says Fröhlich. “What I didn’t realise then was quite how much amazing science there is in the modern nappy.” From waste to worth: towards a circular economy FOR over 25 years, Pampers has been integrating sustainable thinking into its R&D and manufacturing programs. The result is thinner, lighter nappies that give babies greater manoeuvrability and have less environmental impact. Nevertheless, 170 billion nappies are thrown away annually and Pampers is committed to diverting nappies away from landfill. Which is why P&G has joined forces with its Italian partner, Fater, to develop a plant that recycles disposable nappies with other absorbent hygiene products (AHPs). The plant, in Treviso, Italy, can process 10,000 tonnes of waste a year. That’s 65 million nappies. AHP waste is fed into a chamber where pressurised steam sterilises it and neutralises odours. Cellulose and super absorbing polymers are then separated for reuse in other industries. “It is the only such recycling site in Europe and the most advanced worldwide,” says Dr Ioannis Hatzopoulos, P&G Sustainability Communications.

MENU All Girls Fantasy Sports Advice Real sports As seen on tv Rankings Everything else Shop Home Animals Current Page The Coen Brothers Have Directed A Super Bowl Ad For The First Time In 15 Years Tweet Rick Chandler 3:32 pm, January 27th, 2017 The Super Bowl commercials to start rolling in, and Sportsgrid is here to give you the lowdown. Yes, spoilers, beware! At approximately $5 million per 30 seconds, companies are going all out to sell you the American Dream … plus there will be snacks. As the new spots come out, we’ll be keeping you up to date right here, and when we get enough full ads we’ll rank ’em. Check back every day until Feb. 5. UPDATES: * Mercedes-Benz The Coen Brothers debut their first Super Bowl ad since 2002. Ya. Just ask Stan Grossman, he’ll tell ya that’s the way to go here. * Yellow Tail is the first Super Bowl ad for wine in 29 years. * Melissa McCarthy is stuck on an ice floe in a Kia. Damn global warming. The Full Ads With films such as Fargo, Raising Arizona and The Big Lebowski, the Coen Brothers are nearly as iconic as Peter Fonda and the 1969 classic Easy Rider. Now the three come together for a Super Bowl commercial. The Coens wrote and directed this one, for Mercedes-Benz, their first since making a Super Bowl ad for H&R Block in 2002. AdWeek: “Peter Fonda plays a critical piece of the storyline, and he’s known as someone who still epitomizes what it is to love driving performance and the open road,” said Drew Slaven, vice president of marketing for Mercedes-Benz USA. “… The film [Easy Rider] component goes back 48 years. We thought there was a nice parallel that was set up between the era of that and what was, in 1967, the beginnings of AMG.” The Coens also directed a spot for Honda 18 years ago. Believe it or not, Mr. Clean is coming up on his 60th anniversary next year. Making his debut in 1958, the Procter & Gamble cleaning product was invented by the owner of a shipping line who needed a non-toxic cleaning product that wouldn’t make his workers sick. Mr. Clean immediately became the top-selling household cleaner on the market. Its mascot, the smiling genie-in-a-cleaning-bottle, has changed little in 59 years — in appearance, anyway. This year Procter & Gamble has introduced a new, sexy Mr. Clean, a detergent gigolo who just may seduce your wife if you’re not vigilant. In its Super Bowl debut, Procter & Gamble gives us the new Mr. Clean. I feel a little ill: Skittles checks in with their new ad, and it’s an upgrade from last year’s bizarre Steven Tyler nightmare-inducer. “Katy! …” Yellow Tail got around Anheuser-Busch’s exclusive rights to alcohol advertising in the Big Game by doing this regional ad, which will be seen in 80 percent of the country. TurboTax is back for the fourth consecutive year with a 45-second spot, starring Humpty Dumpty. Wix would like to remind you that it’s easy to make your own stunning web site. Although what that has to do with busting up a restaurant is unclear. Intel apparently thinks that people will watch Tom Brady do anything — even brush his teeth before eating a pancake off of the floor. After taking it away from a dog. I would have re-thought this one. Teaser Trailers Febreze is another Procter & Gamble product, this one which probes the phenomenon of the Halftime Bathroom break. Includes stock footage of a buffalo stampede so you know its good. We don’t know exactly how this is going to work, but Snickers‘ 30-second spot will be live to lead off the third quarter of the game. It will feature Adam Driver (Kylo Ren in Star Wars: The Force Awakens, and be preceded by a 36-hour livestream, at SnickersLive.com (noon ET on Thursday, Feb. 2, until midnight Friday night. Here are four teasers, combined for your convenience. None of it makes any sense so far. GoDaddy is under new management (a new ad agency), and is back after skipping Super Bowl 50. According to AdAge, the ad will go like this: “In GoDaddy’s commercial, we will be introduced to the ‘Internet,’ who is covered in tattoos of web references, like Wi-Fi symbols, memes and floppy discs. The 30-second game day spot will include a look inside the house of the ‘Internet’ and will feature a song made popular by the internet. While most of the references included in the commercial will be recognizable to a broad audience, there will be some more obscure references hidden throughout.” Avocados From Mexico is back, and the ad — to be shown during the first commercial break of the game — will focus on the avocado being a health food. Since more avocados are consumed during the Super Bowl than during any other time of the year, it’s surprising that AFM have only been in the past three big games. Here’s the teaser trailer, featuring Jon Lovitz: Kia is going to make you wait awhile to see what’s chasing Melissa McCarthy. In another trailer, she’s stuck on an iceberg. PepsiCo will be touting its line of bottled water products, Lifewtr, with its Inspiration Drops spot. Featured will be a song by John Legend. Not participating this year Butterfinger, Doritos, Mini USA, SunTrust, Taco Bell, Toyota, Visa. Heinz, which gave us the entertaining Weiner Stampede during last year’s game, is also not returning to the Super Bowl. But they saved a few mil by running an ad right after the game, and releasing an extended version online (which may be the wave of the future). Heinz has started a petition to make the day after the Super Bowl and national holiday.

The world of Galileo: Eight days in Italy to discover the science of the Renaissance Home The secret science in your home The secret science in your home 6 October 2016 Sponsored by Fabric care: the secret revolution Fabric care used to be just about stain removal. Now clever chemistry can also keep clothes looking newer for longer Frederic Chapentier/Getty P&G Advertising Feature YOU’RE probably familiar with the life cycle of a T-shirt. At first, you wear it with pride, perhaps washing it reluctantly to preserve its newness. But as the lustre fades, you demote it to house wear before eventually consigning its faded glory to the back of the wardrobe. Advertisement Washing plays a key role in this life cycle. Improper washing may cause colours to fade, fabrics to stretch and seams to break. It’s easy to feel that your cherished outfits deserve better. Why should washing new clothes provoke such anxiety? The answer is that it needn’t. The technology to keep clothes looking new for longer is already in the detergents and fabric conditioners developed by scientists at P&G, one of the world’s leading consumer goods companies. In a leafy campus in Brussels, some 600 scientists and engineers from 40 countries are developing and testing a new generation of fabric care products that are changing the way people think about their clothes and how they care for them. “The new generation of detergents is improving the world, one wash at a time“ At the heart of this is the smart chemistry in P&G’s detergents, like that in the Ariel Pod (above). These contain surfactants, long stringy molecules that bind to water at one end and oily substances at the other. Aided by agitation during a wash, these help to break up fatty stains, lift them off fabric and lock them in the water ready to be rinsed away. But other types of stains are more stubborn, some foods and body fluids for example. So detergents also include enzymes, biomolecules that can attack the offending grime. They include proteases that break down proteins, lipases that fragment fats and oils, as well as amylases that carve up carbohydrates. Water is crucial for hydration but it can also hinder the cleaning process. Hard water, full of metal ions, can neutralise surfactants, so detergents usually contain water softeners, known as builders and chelating agents, which take metal ions out of circulation. Finally, special polymers keep dirt suspended during the wash cycle, helping to prevent redeposition and the greying of clothes this can cause. Cool chemistry P&G’s detergents also contain “optical enhancers” that are deposited on fabrics making them look whiter and brighter. Dr Neil Lant, a research fellow at P&G’s Newcastle Innovation Centre in the UK and his colleagues are on a mission to challenge what’s possible by designing detergents that deliver powerful stain removal and keep that T-shirt looking good too. “Detergents need to clean and keep clothes looking newer for longer,” he says. The team search for ways to make key ingredients work better in colder and quicker washes. For example, they have created an amylase which works at 15 °C. This involved P&G partnering with Danish biotech company Novozymes to redesign an existing enzyme that preferred higher temperatures. The job of P&G’s researchers is complicated by trends in the fashion industry to use more synthetic fabrics. Since 1990, polyester has been replacing cotton as the most common clothing fibre because of its low cost and durability. More recently, the trend for figure-hugging and sporty-looking casual clothes – “athleisure” wear – has introduced more elastane, or Lycra®, into clothing. “The big problem with these synthetics is that they are magnets for grime and bad odours,” says Lant. Anything oily sticks strongly to synthetic fibres, including the 20 grams of greasy sebum that an adult’s skin produces every day. Elastane fibres are also prone to damage from limescale encrustations leading to a loss of “stretchiness”. Ariel’s advanced liquid formulas, with chelant technology, are designed to help prevent hard water mineral damage, a key cause of sagging. It’s a wrap All this smart chemistry has to be carefully packaged. The latest of P&G’s detergents is the Ariel 3-in-1 pod, which delivers just 28 millilitres of detergent per wash, half the standard dose. It took 8 years to create, yielded 50 patents and was tested on 8 tonnes of washing. The pod is made of polyvinyl alcohol film, which is soluble in water. This must be strong enough to survive shipping, stable enough to survive months in storage and yet quick to dissolve in a washing machine. “That meant we needed a detergent with a low water content,” says Annick Vandeputte, senior scientist at P&G’s Brussels Innovation Center. “Less than 10 per cent of what’s in there is water.” The pod keeps ingredients apart in three chambers until the moment they combine in the wash. The pods are a hit with consumers who want clothes to look new for longer and are easier for the less experienced, such as students, and for the elderly and visually impaired who may have trouble measuring out quantities. There are other advantages too. An important goal for P&G is sustainability – a super compact pod uses less detergent for each wash and colder, quicker washes are better for your clothes and use less energy too. For Lant, Vandeputte and their colleagues, that’s important: their new generation of detergents is improving the world, one wash at a time. And keeping your T-shirts looking newer for longer. Age protection The fabric conditioner Lenor makes clothes softer and smell fresher. But it has another crucial role, says Dr Renae Fossum, principal scientist at P&G’s Cincinnati Fabric and Home Care Innovation Center in Ohio. It protects garments against ageing. Lenor is relatively simple chemically. It has a water-loving head atop a long, fatty tail. When dispersed in water, these molecules form spherical vesicles with the heads on the outside and the fatty tails inside. “When the vesicles touch a fibre, they break and spread out to form a lubricating layer,” says Fossum. This has multiple benefits. “It reduces the friction between fibres so they can return to their original positions more easily,” says Fossum. This process helps garments keep their shape. It also stops fibres, especially cottons, from splitting and creating fuzz. And it maintains the colour vibrancy. That’s because much of the colour fade from washing isn’t the result of dye loss but increased scattering of light reflected from damaged and disordered fibres. This causes the fabric to look duller and lose its sheen. Lenor combats this by helping to keep fibres smoother and aligned, so that light reflects uniformly from them. This helps keep the colours bright and vivid. And it helps keep clothes looking new for longer.

The world of Galileo: Eight days in Italy to discover the science of the Renaissance Home The secret science in your home The secret science in your home 25 January 2017 Sponsored by Nappy tech: inspired by babies A layered approach to child care – the humble nappy goes high tech NOT many research facilities have walls decorated with giant bumble bees and paddling ducklings. Nor do they tend to distract their study subjects with colourful slides and miniature shopping trolleys. Pampers – the first brand to widely introduce disposable nappy technology – has been understanding the needs of parents and babies to create new innovation for over 50 years. At the P&G Nappy Research and Development Centre in Schwalbach, Germany, around 250 researchers, part of a global team of over 800 scientists, ranging from dermatologists and chemists to material engineers, are designing the nappies of the future. The creative power of this team has enabled P&G to file more than 5000 nappy-improving patents. Babies in motion: 3D scanning Disposable nappies have changed beyond measure since their beginnings in the late 1940s. Their chief purpose, however, remains the same: to minimise leaks and keep skin dry and healthy and babies comfortable. Advertisement To help achieve this, babies and toddlers are regularly invited to the child-friendly research suite at Schwalbach. The shape, fit and movement of their nappies are observed as they play. Detailed measurements are made in a large 3D scanner, consisting of 20 synchronised cameras arranged around a platform. Down the corridor is a specialised lab where dermatologists measure skin pH and loss of water from the skin as part of their efforts to minimise skin irritation. Researchers also give packets of nappies to 1,200 families a week. These may be experimental designs or existing products. Parents are asked to keep a diary of how each performs, detailing such things as leaks, shape changes and dryness and condition of the skin. This feedback is combined with the properties of materials in nappies, such as elasticity and absorbency, to create computer models of new designs. These are used to calculate the chances of a leak or excessive sagging, for example. “We can assess 20 virtual nappy prototypes and eliminate all but two or three,” says Dr Frank Wiesemann, P&G Principal Baby Care Scientist. “We then test those fully, rather than testing all 20.” Channelling innovation Schwalbach plays a key role in delivering major innovations in nappy design. Below the permeable sheet next to the baby’s skin, for example, most nappies have a polymeric “acquisition layer” that draws urine away from the skin. P&G’s scientists have added a second “distribution layer” to Pampers nappies, which disperses liquid around the nappy so it can be absorbed more efficiently. This is mostly made of cellulose, long thin fibres extracted from wood pulp. P&G treats them to create short “cross links” that strengthen the fibres (see graphic). This helps the nappy absorb quickly, even when a child sits on it when it’s full. Liquid flows along gaps between the closely bound cellulose strands which act like capillary tubes. “You need active distribution of the urine, whichever position the baby is in,” says senior P&G scientist Dr Ute Fröhlich. “Capillary forces between the cellulose fibres are high, so urine can move rapidly even against gravity.” Most of the liquid then passes to the absorbent core layer of the nappy. Until recently, the core of a Pampers nappy resembled those of some other brands: a mixture of cellulose and particles of super absorbent polymer capable of soaking up huge amounts of liquid relative to its own weight. The idea was that the cellulose initially soaks up the urine and the super absorbent polymer dries out the cellulose. However, it is impossible to dry out the cellulose completely, so urine can be released back under pressure. To deal with this, P&G developed a new super absorbent polymer that absorbs and distributes urine more quickly, allowing them to eliminate cellulose from the core. This has cut the weight of a single Pampers by around 5 grams, or 16 per cent, which is good for children. In a study funded by P&G, psychologists at New York University showed that, compared with cloth nappies, thin disposables help toddlers to keep their feet, reducing stumbles and falls. Some super absorbent polymers can take up hundreds of times their own weight in liquid, but P&G has constrained the new version to absorb between 20 and 30 times its weight. As a result, the particles do not merge into a single jelly-like blob. They stay as individual spheres even when saturated, so that any extra urine can flow past them to be absorbed elsewhere. Innovation doesn’t end there. Some nappies leak as a result of losing their shape when worn by active infants. To minimise this, P&G recently shaped the core into three absorbing channels to help the nappy keep its shape. Finally, faeces are trickier to deal with than urine. Clinical studies have shown that the enzymes in faeces can be aggressive on baby skin, especially when activated by high pH urines. So quick removal of faeces from the skin reduces risk of nappy rash. To improve performance, a Pampers Premium Protection nappy has a top sheet that has little conical apertures, allowing faeces to get into the core instead of spreading on top. This reduces faeces contact with the skin. “When I chose to study chemistry I didn’t set out to become a poo and wee expert,” says Fröhlich. “What I didn’t realise then was quite how much amazing science there is in the modern nappy.” From waste to worth: towards a circular economy FOR over 25 years, Pampers has been integrating sustainable thinking into its R&D and manufacturing programs. The result is thinner, lighter nappies that give babies greater manoeuvrability and have less environmental impact. Nevertheless, 170 billion nappies are thrown away annually and Pampers is committed to diverting nappies away from landfill. Which is why P&G has joined forces with its Italian partner, Fater, to develop a plant that recycles disposable nappies with other absorbent hygiene products (AHPs). The plant, in Treviso, Italy, can process 10,000 tonnes of waste a year. That’s 65 million nappies. AHP waste is fed into a chamber where pressurised steam sterilises it and neutralises odours. Cellulose and super absorbing polymers are then separated for reuse in other industries. “It is the only such recycling site in Europe and the most advanced worldwide,” says Dr Ioannis Hatzopoulos, P&G Sustainability Communications.

Mark Von Holden Invision for Mr. Clean i By Greg Hadley ghadley@mcclatchy.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Get ready to look at mopping the floor in a whole new way. In the run up to the Super Bowl on Feb. 5, dozens of companies are rushing to generate buzz for themselves by releasing advertisements that are funny, emotional or downright edgy. And while the big game is still more than a week away, cleaning brand Mr. Clean clearly has the early edge in that regard. Mr. Clean, which is owned by manufacturing company Procter & Gamble, released the following ad Friday.   In the ad, a suburban woman appears to be frustrated by a stain on her stove, before Mr. Clean, the iconic mascot of the brand, shows up in all his erotic CGI glory. As sensual music plays, the two characters clean the house, culminating in Mr. Clean mopping the floor in extremely tight pants that, um, show off his assets. The ad ends with the reveal that Mr. Clean is actually the woman’s significant other, with the tagline, “You Gotta Love a Man Who Cleans.” The idea behind the whole ad is to make cleaning attractive to men and challenge the idea that women are the only ones who would be interested in a cleaning product, per AdAge. “There's no better way to reach a co-ed audience than the Super Bowl," Procter & Gamble vice president Martin Hettich told the website. "And the subject we're broaching with Mr. Clean really is for a co-ed audience, because it's talking about cleaning and how men and women divide up the chores. And there's still a way to go." According to data compiled by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in 2014, 83 percent of women reported doing household work, while just 65 percent of men said the same, per Time Magazine. Online, however, the ad was met with a broad range of reactions. Some appreciated the cheeky re-branding of the character, while others described themselves as uncomfortable with the idea of a sexualized Mr. Clean. Either way, the video has been a success in driving conversation about the brand, as it racked up nearly 450,000 views in a day on YouTube. However, the video did seem to shift attention from Procter & Gamble’s announcement Tuesday that a new flesh-and-blood actor had been cast to play the real-life Mr. Clean in the future. Mike Jackson, the company’s choice, is African-American, marking a first in the brand’s history, per Yahoo News.   [View the story "'Sexy' Mr. Clean" on Storify] Related content LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story National Suggested for you   Comments Videos facebook twitter email Share More Videos 3:31 Hope to prevent Alzheimer's disease?

What sets her foray into luxury apart from the rest is it’s stance on empowering women refugees.  “The motivation behind it developed during my work in supply chain management in the Multi-National, Procter and Gamble; quickly I knew my heart was not in corporate life and its politics but rather in social work. So with a clear passion and good business experience, I had a vision for Palestyle, a luxury fashion brand empowering refugee women,” Chabaan told Saudi Gazette. She said true inspiration came from meeting Palestinian refugee women during her visits to refugee camps. Chabaan found various artisans embroidering with  colorful silk threads. “From there the brand concept developed to genuine leather handbags signed off with gold plated Arabic calligraphy and handmade embroidery.”   The brand grew exponentially and made it to high end retailers like Bloomingdales and House of Fraser. It was even seen on celebrities Eva Longoria and Gwenyth Paltrow. Palestyle went on to win the Emirates Women Humanitarian Award in 2013. Now the brand has diversified their collection by launching Palestyle Living, Embroidered Home Accessories, and shifted the production of the hand bags to Italy. “So embroidery from the refugee camps in Middle East travel to Italian Workshops where bags are crafted. To date we have empowered around 100 refugee women with jobs, over 4000 refugees with social development projects, and 450 refugee children with a reading opportunity through our latest social project, a community library built for them. It has been a roller coaster ride between success, learnings and difficulties. Sweat, tears and smiles but definitely the continuous drive of serving the refugee women with every Palestyle creation keeps us going.” Find out more about the brand in an exclusive interview with Chabaan. SG: How is it working with refugee women in Jordan- who initiated this and how do you facilitate the movement? ZC: It is not easy as the women are tough negotiators. So every women would decide on how many pieces she likes to work on, at the comfort of her own home, upon the rate she agrees on. Pieces do take their time to be embroidered. There was lots of training on quality to ensure every embroidery piece is of clean finishing and rich stitching. Palestyle sends the digital pattern to our quality control head in Amman. They distribute work among ladies ensuring quality and timeliness of delivery and we make frequent visits each year to ensure all is running smoothly. SG: Tell us about the brand name and what it means to you? ZC: The brand name was inspired by the beautiful Palestinian refugee women embroidering with so much love and hope. Today Palestyle aims to serve all refugee ladies possible regardless of boundary and background. SG: Can reflect on the aesthetics of the brand. ZC: The brand’s aesthetics and concept, are a reflection of each other. Both highlight the DNA of Palestyle which is Luxury, Heritage through Arabic Calligraphy & Hand-made Embroidery, and thirdly our Social Impacting. Visually in the Logo we can see the luxury element through the choice of colors, Red and Black, and fine capital typography of name; while heritage is reflected subtly through the traditional embroidery pattern used in Logo, called Moon of Betlehem. Finally our commitment to social impacting is mentioned in our slogan too “High End – On Trend – With a Social Edge” SG: Your journey and dreams ZC: Our dream is to see Palestyle as one of the top 10 High End Social Fashion Brands in the World. We have quite a long way to go along this exciting journey to ultimately get where we want to. SG: Your latest collection  ZC: It reflects the brand’s DNA amazingly where luxury Italian craftsmanship embraces the beauty of our rich heritage. The making of the bags features crisp classical lines merging with Arabic calligraphy and handmade embroidery in a very subtle and modern way. Inspiration behind it is very geometrical -strong powerful lines- and the colors taken from nature. SG: Can you reflect on your journey and experience in the regional fashion industry  ZC: I am mostly impressed, inspired and challenged by the fashion consumer who through this decade has shifted from a consumer to a trendsetter through incredible savviness, a high taste of luxury and definitive influence through social media. SG: Challenges and how you keep up with changing trends  ZC: The challenges of the fashion Industry especially now a days for luxury brands is how to maximize on technology available without intruding the customer, how to personalize marketing and customize for the customer, and how to reach the affluence in a challenging global economy. The international market regardless how big is becoming smaller with availability of data and globalization making competition move at a very fast pace. Therefore we constantly try to tackle those points to our advantage especially being an entrepreneurial business.

Mr. Clean does a sexy cleaning dance in his ad during the Super Bowl (Photo: Procter & Gamble via YouTube) Mr. Clean has gotten buff -- and sexy -- for his Super Bowl ad debut. Procter & Gamble has released its first-ever Super Bowl ad for Mr. Clean. The 30-second spot features the iconic-but-refreshed character who's still bald and muscular but seems a little younger and sexier than his old self. You can see the ad at USA TODAY's Super Bowl Ad Meter site here. Entitled "Cleaner of Your Dreams," the mostly wordless ad depicts Mr. Clean showing up at red-haired woman's house. Clad tight in his signature white T-shirt and pants, Mr. Clean sashays and dances as he moves and cleans from kitchen, to bathroom to living room as music pulses. The blissed-out homemaker also begins to sway to the music's vibe before a voice calls out her name. "Sarah? Sarah?" as the fantasy concludes. She opens her eyes and it's her shlub of a mate standing before her. "Clean enough?" he asks. She crashes into his arms as they both collapse on the couch. "You gotta love a man who cleans" pops across the screen.

Details are limited, but P&G revealed the spot will feature New England Patriots tight end Rob "Gronk" Gronkowski and "Transparent" TV star Jeffrey Tambor. "Tide is happy to announce it will be part of Super Bowl Sunday," the company said in a statement. "The story will unfold the week of Super Bowl, but two cleaning enthusiasts you can expect to see are Rob Gronkowski and Jeffrey Tambor who ultimately discover the cleaning power of Tide." This notches a third P&G Super Bowl ad this year by the Cincinnati-based consumer products giant. Meanwhile: P&G also released on Thursday an online teaser ad for its upcoming Febreze ad also running during the Super Bowl. The clip showcases the brand's new OdorClear formula, noting it will come in handy in the bathroom during the half time break in households nationwide. It boldly asks "Is your bathroom ready, America?" 6799 CONNECTTWEET 5 LINKEDIN 6 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2jFqxkU NEVER MISS OUT Managing Your Money Master your money with the latest business and investment news, articles and tips from financial experts each Friday.

The world of Galileo: Eight days in Italy to discover the science of the Renaissance Home News Humans This Week 26 November 2014 How baby talk gives your child the best start in life (Image: Chad Springer/Plainpicture) By Aviva Rutkin Just keep talking This article is being made free to view thanks to sponsorship from P&G THERE is only one real rule to conversing with a baby: talking is better than not talking. But that one rule can make a lifetime of difference. Advertisement That’s the message that the US state of Georgia hopes to send with Talk With Me Baby, a public health programme devoted to the art of baby talk. Starting in January, nurses will be trained in the best way to speak to babies to help them learn language, based on what the latest neuroscience says. Then they, along with teachers and nutritionists, will model this good behaviour for the parents they meet. Georgia hopes to expose every child born in 2015 in the Atlanta area to this speaking style; by 2018, the hope is to reach all 130,000 or so newborns across the state. Talk With Me Baby is the latest and largest attempt to provide “language nutrition” to infants in the US – a rich quantity and variety of words supplied at a critical time in the brain’s development. Similar initiatives have popped up in Providence, Rhode Island, where children have been wearing high-tech vests that track every word they hear, and Hollywood, where the Clinton Foundation has encouraged television shows like Parenthood and Orange is the New Black to feature scenes demonstrating good baby talk. “The idea is that language is as important to the brain as food is to physical growth,” says Arianne Weldon, director of Get Georgia Reading, one of several partner organisations involved in Talk With Me Baby. “The idea is that language is as important to the brain as food is to physical growth” “You don’t need a neuroscientist to tell you that it’s better to provide more supportive parenting and stimulating experiences,” says Martha Farah, a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. “But neuroscience points us to specific pathways that might be good places to intervene.” Attention was drawn to the importance of language nutrition two decades ago by psychologists Betty Hart and Todd Risley at the University of Kansas. They tracked 42 families with young children for several years, noting the number and type of words that parents spoke to their children over the course of a typical day. The data revealed an alarming trend: by the age of 3, children from affluent families had heard some 30 million more words than their impoverished counterparts. Early language exposure has since been linked to a number of cognitive skills, including attention, memory and emotional development. For example, studies of bilingual children – who hear a greater variety of sounds – suggest that they are better at tasks such as ignoring irrelevant information and switching between different activities. Those who hear more words early on also have larger vocabularies and better real-time word processing by the age of 2. Grade boost Such findings have persuaded policy-makers that more and better conversations can help kids from disadvantaged backgrounds get ahead in school and in life. “Daily interactions help our youngest kids learn words, build vocabulary, and yes, develop their brains,” former US secretary of state Hillary Clinton told a conference at the New York Academy of Sciences earlier this month, where such interventions were discussed. “They lay a foundation for future success long before a child steps foot into a classroom for the first time. Sadly, however, many of our kids are not getting the support they need to grow and thrive to their fullest potential.” This is acutely felt in Georgia, where 27 per cent of children were living in poverty in 2012 – 5 per cent higher than the national average – and more than half are eligible for free or reduced price meals at school. The specific aim of Talk With Me Baby is to boost the state’s dismal school reading levels – just a third of children are reading proficiently by the age of 8 – but it will also be evaluated on its impact on overall well-being, reported via measures such as preschool expulsion rates. The first year of life is a particularly explosive time for neural growth. Although babies aren’t yet talking, their brains are already identifying common speech sounds by how often they appear. At this point, they can distinguish between nuances in languages as disparate as Chinese and Swedish, an ability that falls off as they age. It’s imperative that this language exposure happens in person. In a study run by Patricia Kuhl at the University of Washington, babies from English-speaking families sat through a dozen 25-minute sessions of reading and playing in Mandarin Chinese. Some spent their time face-to-face with a native Mandarin speaker, while others watched identical sessions on DVD or listened to audio while looking at a teddy bear. The former group learned to differentiate between Mandarin syllables as well as babies raised in Taiwan but the latter two could not. Through Talk With Me Baby, Weldon and her team intend to demonstrate effective speech to parents first-hand. One trick is to talk in parentese, the slow sing-song cadence that adults tend to slip into when speaking to children – studies suggest that infants pay more attention to it than to regular speech. Another is to talk about whatever seems to already draw the child’s attention, like a passing train or a toy, rather than try to get them to focus on something different. The professionals will be expected to demonstrate the good speech skills as they work. A nurse teaching a new mother how to give a bath, for example, might explain the steps directly to the baby while the adult listens. The project also plans to release a smartphone app for parents that plays videos of sample baby talk and suggests conversation topics based on your location. Meanwhile, other organisations are exploring what language nutrition can do for children. The Thirty Million Words initiative in Chicago teaches a 12-part language nutrition programme centred on “three Ts”: tune in, talk more and take turns. Jessica Polk, a Chicago mother of three, went through the programme several years ago. She says it helped her learn how to build conversations around what her baby was interested in. “We realised we should tune into what they want to do and they’ll pay attention more,” she says. “I’ve told a lot of people about it.” Thirty Million Words is now recruiting for a randomised control study. For five years, it will follow the progress of 200 Chicago families, half of whom will undergo language nutrition training, to see what kind of impact the intervention has on school readiness. “As we learn more about the brain and how it is connected, we’re able to be more effective in trying to impact this public health issue,” says Dana Suskind, founder of Thirty Million Words. “Brains aren’t born. They’re built”. “As we learn more about the brain, we’re able to be more effective in closing children’s language gap” Deep impacts The first 1000 days of life are a busy time for the growing brain. An impoverished environment can have a lasting impact. 1 The prefrontal cortex is behind much of our thinking and reasoning. Children born to parents with lower educational achievements tend to have thinner prefrontal cortices, which may explain why they are worse at filtering out distractions while they work – a skill specific to this brain region. 2 The hippocampus is responsible for learning and memory. Kids who had poor parental support in early childhood show signs of a smaller hippocampus by the time they reach school age. 3 A smaller amygdala, a structure that handles our emotions, has been associated with children from low-income homes or born to parents with less education. 4 During our early years, different regions of our brains start to specialise in certain tasks. Word tasks are delegated to the left side of the brain, in particular to Broca’s area. But fMRI scans of 5-year-olds found that the brains of those from disadvantaged backgrounds weren’t as specialised as their high-income counterparts. 5 MRI scans of children under 5 found that those from low-income families had lower volumes of grey matter in their frontal and parietal lobes, which are associated with working memory and language, among other things. That’s not to say that these changes can’t be overturned. The brain is most malleable in childhood, and responds well to interventions in the early years. For example, the Bucharest Early Intervention Project has followed 136 children from Romanian orphanages since 2000. Those placed in foster homes before they turned 2 showed higher brain activity across several different regions and higher scores on emotional and cognitive tests compared with those who remained in institutions.

My Way was written by Canadian Paul Anka for Frank Sinatra. So much for that "buy American" or "America first" policy. Bob Miller, Hamilton We don't need to hear Harper talking Trump RE: Stephen Harper sees global uncertainty under Trump (Jan. 18, the spec.com) Canada doesn't need ex-PM Harper crawling out from under his rock to state the obvious when it comes to Donald Trump. Trump is an American and his priorities and loyalties are to America and Americans first and foremost. Perhaps Harper should have kept Canadians in mind before he allowed the sale of some of Canada's resources and companies to American and Chinese interest. Just drive down Burlington Street in Hamilton and see the decades-old empty sites of Firestone, Dominion Glass, Procter & Gamble, International Harvester, Otis Elevator, Westinghouse, Studebaker. The list goes on and on with the danger of reliance of foreign ownership and control. Harper as well as other ex-prime ministers now work as investment consultants for multinational corporations. While espousing his concern for Canadians crippled by high taxes, many who have lost jobs and pensions, his livelihood is based on inside knowledge of the government. If I want to listen to inane patter I'll watch Ben Mulroney interview American celebrities for what passes as international news on CTV. Walt Fisher, Hamilton Check out 'Birth of a Nation' RE: Marking Canada's anniversary Feeling especially patriotic in this significant year of our country's history, I borrowed the movie 'John A, The Birth Of A Nation' from the Hamilton library system. It is a CBC production, offering important insights into the development of this country of Canada. I highly recommend it. Michael Peacefull, Hamilton Obama did the right thing on inauguration RE: Trump presidency As a political science student at McMaster I have been exposed to a lot of material regarding how a series of actions can have a negative impact on a country, as well as an economy. In this instance, President Obama did the appropriate and reasonable thing by attending the Trump inauguration. In boycotting this event, President Obama would cause a multitude of issues — possibly riots — across the country. The United States has already experienced a lot of unrest following the election in November and by attending the inauguration. Former president Obama is promoting a peaceful transition. Historically, the outgoing First-Family has attended this event and to do anything out of the ordinary would tarnish the graceful legacy that the Obama's have established. If American's felt so strongly against Trump they should have voiced their opinion on Nov. 8 — for now we will just have to see how well it plays out over the next four years and in 2020 hopefully more than 50 per cent of the population turns out to vote. Rene Hares, Hamilton Downie's legacy is a better Canada RE: Gord Downie If Secret Path is the last thing Gord Downie does he will die happy — and we, the Canadians that get to go on living, will benefit from his work. He will leave the world a much better place because of his passionate pursuit to mend the hurt caused by the terrible Indian residential school system. In the months since he has been diagnosed with terminal brain cancer he has worked tirelessly to bring a great tragedy of our time to the forefront and has made us face it head on. We cannot undo the unspeakable harm done to so many innocent indigenous children and their families but we can learn from it and make sure we never treat our fellow human beings with such shameful disregard again. What Gord Downie is doing can easily positively impact many Canadians and change their view on this topic. Coming from a school that embodies the vision of human rights, there could not be a greater contrast between my school environment and that of the Indian residential schools. No one, least of all a child, should have to suffer as Chanie Wenjack and so many others did, all for the sake of their race and culture. The proceeds from the Secret Path album will go to the Gord Downie Secret Path Fund for Truth and Reconciliation at the University of Manitoba. Rowan Watson, Dundas How about free trade in Canada? RE: Free trade Justin Trudeau is quick to laud the importance of free trade as he awaits whether Donald Trump will tear up NAFTA. Canada aggressively pursues free trade agreements with the EU and Asia. The CETA and Trans-Pacific Partnership respectfully, yet you can be arrested for bringing cases of beer across from Quebec to Ontario. I guess Quebec will have to split from Canada before it becomes legal. J.R. Nichols, Hamilton Local 1005 got what it wanted RE: Stelco restructuring Once again Stelco retirees are making headlines with complaints of diminishing benefits and claims politicians aren't doing enough for them. These are the same people who stood up and cheered back in the late 1980s when the Local 1005 hierarchy harangued them, vowing to "bring the company to its knees." They succeeded in doing just that and now they're complaining? You reap what you sow.

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Saturday, 28 January 2017 Chakrabarti takes over running of MediaCom MEDIACOM has announced changes to the leadership of its Malaysian operations with Chanchal Chakrabarti to take over the running of the agency as Neal Estavillo steps down from the managing director role. Chakrabarti is one of MediaCom’s most experienced and respected regional talents, currently leading the P&G assignment across the Asean region. In this role, he oversees a team of more than 100 across several countries and has driven multiple industry innovations and been recognized with many awards. He is excited to return to Malaysia where he spent eight very successful years leading Mindshare and Maxus, building life-long friendships and collecting no less than four Malaysia Media Agency of the Year trophies. Chakrabarti will maintain his regional responsibilities as an Asia Pacific managing partner, reporting directly to MediaCom Asia Pacific CEO Mark Heap, but will relocate from Singapore to Kuala Lumpur and in addition take on the MediaCom Malaysia managing director responsibilities. Neal Estavillo will be leaving the agency after over five years in charge, during which time, he’s contributed significantly to building MediaCom into one of the country’s most successful agencies. During Estavillo’s tenure, MediaCom had a number of notable regional and local pitch wins including P&G, Fonterra, Sony Mobile, Coca-Cola, Sunway Group and Celcom.

The new Herbal Essences Bio:Renew line doesn’t promise a climax-inducing shampoo (gosh we miss those '90s shower commercials), but it does offer nine collections of shampoos, conditioners and stylers that are free of colorants, parabens and gluten, and are designed to address every hair type and need. Here’s the deal: Procter & Gamble (the parent company of Herbal Essences) formulated the line using an antioxidant and amino acid called histidine, that's derived from fermented corn sugar. Histidine is able to find the elements that are damaging your hair and "traps" them so that they can be washed away, out of your hair, or at least make them inactive until the next time you wash your hair. Similar to how a superfood works in the body, Bio:Renew protects hair from the inside out by trapping, neutralizing and removing the build-up of free radicals that wreak havoc on hair—caused by everyday factors such as pollution, coloring, sun exposure and even the copper found in the tap water we use to wash our hair. Also in the mix is aloe (which is loaded with minerals that promote nutrient absorption) and sea kelp (a natural source of vitamins A, B1, B2, C, D, and E) inside each product.

But we were able to formulate [the product] so that the histidine actually is absorbed into the hair. Normal haircare really just treats the surface of something dead.” We asked Randy Schueller a cosmetic chemist and the cofounder of thebeautybrains.com, to find out if removing minerals from your hair really makes a substantial difference. “The bottom line is that removing minerals from hair can improve hair health to some extent,” says Randy Schueller. “Traditional [bonding] agents can cause some some conditioners to become unstable so they don't work well...to solve this problem P&G formulated a system with histidine that stabilizes [the antioxidants].” However, histidine isn't a miracle worker—in that you won't see instant results—especially immediately after use. Schueller is unsure if the average person will be able to detect it. “The technology could work but the [change in hair health] could be quite small,” he says.

Julia Bradshaw 27 January 2017 • 5:05pm Retail experts and City bankers might have wildly differing views on the merits of a Tesco/Booker merger, but what they all seem to agree on is that for Britain's biggest supermarket chain, snapping up Booker’s chief executive Charles Wilson is possibly the biggest coup of the entire deal. The 50-year-old retail veteran, who started his career at Procter & Gamble and was number two at M&S under the stewardship of Stuart Rose, took the helm at Booker in 2007,  as it was demerged from frozen goods giant Iceland and listed as a separate company. At the time, Booker was a bit of a basket case. The company Mr Wilson inherited was a far cry from the successful corporate behemoth of today that boasts a substantial cash pile and a slow, yet dependable, track record of growth. A businessman known for being as prudent as he is shrewd, Mr Wilson quickly set about restructuring the massively indebted business, focused its strategy and expanded its remit into catering and other areas. He oversaw Booker’s acquisition of fellow wholesaler Makro in 2012 and the purchase of Musgrave Retail Partners in 2015, the company that owns the Londis and Budgens chains. Booker Group 1-year share price He’s been called a “genius”, “remarkably likeable”, “one of the most intelligent men on earth” and “annoying talented” by his peers. He’s also been touted as a possible successor to Tesco’s boss, Dave Lewis. There’s even speculation that, as part of the merger, Wilson himself might assume the top job. “Charles Wilson is seen as a major capture for Tesco and already touted as Lewis’s heir apparent,” said Gary Hobbs, senior equity analyst at Investec Wealth & Investment. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said: “Tesco’s poor prior track record with acquisitions raises question marks, while Booker has done a brilliant job with its purchase of Makro, so Wilson’s expertise will be welcome in the Tesco board.” Clive Black, an analyst at Shore Capital, said: “Charles is a talented, fabulous bloke. He is a wonderful intellect and has been a one-man corporate success story in his own right so he is hot property in the British retail world. “He could be running any of the FTSE 100 retailers in the UK if he wanted to. Certainty the odds on him as the next Tesco CEO have shortened.” While the management structure of a TescoBooker is still unclear, what is certain is that Mr Wilson will join Tesco’s board. He also has a five-year lock-in on his shares, which means he’s in it for the long run. As for Booker, the company is now embarking on the next chapter of its varied near 200-year history. Like many businesses, Booker has changed shape several times, buying up businesses, then selling them again - it once owned a fish processing firm - and going from boom to bust. It traces its roots back to the early 19th century when brothers Josias, George and Richard Booker sailed to Guyana, then known as Demerara, to seek their fortunes. They set up sugar plantations, bought their own ships and established trading houses in Liverpool which prospered in the rum and sugar trade. Over time and after a number of major changes, Booker, which in 1969 sponsored the first Booker prize, grew into a food wholesaler we know today. What lies ahead now is anyone's guess.

Entertainment Count on Cinco, JIm Gaffigan's Netflix special, for clean comedy 5 / 5 The Right Chemistry: Tampons, in space and on Earth Joe Schwarcz, Special to the Montreal Gazette More from Joe Schwarcz, Special to the Montreal Gazette Published on: January 27, 2017 | Last Updated: January 27, 2017 12:53 PM EST Share Adjust Comment Print Jeopardy question: Sally Ride took one hundred of these along when she became the first American female astronaut in 1983. Jeopardy answer: What are tampons? Physicist Ride blasted into space aboard the Space Shuttle Challenger in 1983 for a mission that was to last eight days, so the possibility of “that time of the month” had to be considered. Since no American woman had flown in space before, NASA had no information about how microgravity might affect menstruation. Two female Soviet cosmonauts had flown in space before Ride, one for three days and the other for 11, so the Soviets must have addressed the question. However, due to the secrecy surrounding the space race, whatever knowledge they had gathered was not forthcoming. NASA physicians had some concern that without the influence of gravity, blood might flow in the wrong direction, and they wanted to make sure that it would be absorbed before that could happen. They asked Ride how many tampons she might need, and building in a huge safety factor, came up with the preposterous number of 100. Whether Ride had to use the tampons was never revealed, but given the attention being paid to the space program, the episode did generate lots of discussion about tampons. That was useful at the time because women were concerned about “Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS),” a bacterial infection that had been linked with tampons. While modern tampons date back only to the 1930s, attempts to absorb menstrual blood in such a fashion have a long history. Roman women fashioned devices out of wool, and in parts of Africa rolled up grass was favoured. But it was Colorado physician Earle Cleveland Haas who is credited for introducing the prototype of the current product. His wife was a ballerina and Haas was supposedly motivated by her struggles with the pads available at the time. In 1933, he patented a pack of compressed cotton that could be inserted by means of telescoping paper tubes. He called it Tampax, from “tampon” and “pack.” Tampons made it into the headlines just prior to Sally Ride’s mission when Procter and Gamble’s super absorbent Rely, formulated with carboxymethylcellulose and compressed beads of polyester, was linked with TSS. It turned out that the material retained bacterial toxins that would normally pass out of the body with menstrual flow. Other super-absorbent tampons also were found to increase the risk of TSS, although not as much as Rely. Current tampons are not made with carboxymethylcellulose or polyester, but that doesn’t mean they have not been accused of undermining women’s health. One absurd letter circulating on the web claims that manufacturers add asbestos to tampons to increase bleeding so they can sell more product. Ridiculous. Then there is the allegation that tampons are contaminated with dioxin, a notoriously toxic substance linked with cancer and hormonal disruption. The usual suspect for the source of the dioxin is rayon, used for its absorptive property. Rayon is a cellulosic fibre made from wood pulp and its production involves “bleaching.” While this produces a white product, the real purpose of bleaching is to remove various impurities. Classically, bleaching was carried out with chlorine gas, and that turned out to be a problem. Reaction of compounds in wood pulp with chlorine results in the formation of dioxins, nasty substances indeed. But a switch to chlorine dioxide essentially eliminated the formation of dioxins and according to FDA and Health Canada, the trace amounts that may be detected are of no consequence. It is also possible to use hydrogen peroxide as a bleach with no chance of forming dioxins at all. Nevertheless, some brands hype “no rayon,” which amounts to a sales gimmick. These are usually made with unbleached organic cotton, which has no possible contamination with dioxin but are less absorbent. While there is a lot of misinformation about tampons, there is a real issue that merits discussion. And that is their effect on the environment. The concern is about the plastic applicators that are used to insert tampons. Close to 90 per cent sold are equipped with plastic instead of cardboard applicators. Considering that a woman can use up to 17,000 tampons in a lifetime, calculations show that some 8 billion tampons are disposed every year in North America. That’s a lot of plastic! What happens to it? Despite clear instructions that the applicators are not to be flushed down the toilet, many of them are. They end up in sewage and find their way into rivers, lakes and oceans. Some 3,000 were collected in a quick cleanup of 70 beaches in New Jersey in 2014! Aside from the yuck factor, there is a more significant problem. Although the plastic is not biodegradable, it does break into smaller pieces that can be ingested by wildlife. Oysters have been found to be contaminated with microscopic particles of plastic and digestive problems have been detected in fish. Plastic applicators are not a requirement for tampons, but they do make for greater ease and comfort than cardboard versions. In Europe, tampons sans applicator are more popular because women do not want foreign substances inside them. Although manufacturers are secretive about the exact composition of the plastic, it is likely to be low-density polyethylene, a substance that does not leach any phthalates or bisphenol A, two plastic chemicals that have drawn a lot of attention because of their endocrine disruptive properties. Scented tampons, essentially a marketing gimmick, may, however, contain phthalates. In America, women are apparently more adverse to self-touching and don’t like “digital” application of tampons even though that is the more environmentally friendly way to go about the business. Even more environmentally friendly is the silicone menstrual cup. It is inserted like a tampon, emptied out as needed, cleaned with soapy water, and reused. Economical, no dioxin concern and minimal risk of Toxic Shock Syndrome. NASA has not disclosed whether any of the 44 American female astronauts who followed in the footsteps of Sally Ride have tried it. joe.schwarcz@mcgill.ca Joe Schwarcz is director of McGill University’s Office for Science & Society (mcgill.ca/oss).

This packaging made with post-consumer recycled (PCR) content will soon be available in France. A recent report from the World Economic Forum and the Ellen MacArthur Foundation in the UK reveals that of the 300 million tons of virgin plastic that's produced annually, 43% ends up incorrectly deposited in the garbage and ends up in landfills. This is particularly significant because it means that most plastic packaging is used only once. Considering that the look and shape of the Head & Shoulders shampoo bottle seems to remain unchanged, the makeup of this shampoo bottle sets a precedent that brands across multiple industries should take note of.

The president now is aiming at auto companies, trying to bludgeon Ford F, +0.97%  , General Motors GM, -1.36% and Toyota TM, -1.92% into expanding small-car production in the U.S. — reversing decades-old trends of moving the manufacturing of mostly lower-priced, often-unprofitable cars to Mexico, even as Mexican presidents past and present flip The Donald the bird. Stop quaking. Trump’s Twitter TWTR, -1.43% missives have no lasting effect on stocks. I created a list of affected companies, generated by Yahoo Finance, then deleted the privately owned ones. This left 37 public companies about which Trump has tweeted nastygrams since 2012. Trump has been wrong, from an investing standpoint, on 29 of them. In fact, if you shorted 100 shares of each of these 37 companies on the day Trump slammed them, you’re down 37% as of Thursday’s close. Sad! What does this tell us? Investors and CEOs should pay no attention to the man behind the curtain. The tweeter-in-chief can huff and puff, but he can’t blow your house down. Investors don’t care what he tweets, and the record shows they’re right not to. It’s amusing to see the breadth of businesses Trump is wrong about. He’s wrong about tech. Wrong about media, mainstream or otherwise. Wrong about wind power. Wrong about Coca-Cola KO, -0.86%  , Warren Buffett and ESPN. Wrong about Hollywood. Wrong about markets and policy. Wrong about cellphone companies. And atop all this wrongness is Trump’s pan of Facebook’s FB, -0.45% 2012 initial public offering (“hard to believe it could be worth that much”), which came with unsolicited marital advice for founder Mark Zuckerberg — “Get a prenup!” Here's why tech giants want to keep content cheap(2:18) Harvard Business School professor Bharat Anand explains why cheap digital content - from unlimited music and video streaming, to free online document processors and cheap e-books - actually helps tech giants make money. Maybe because I went to high school with the paparazzo who got the famous shot of Trump’s first two wives squaring off on the ski slopes, the thought of the first three-times-married president doling out both marital and stock advice in the same 140 characters is hilarious. Lawyers, by the way, say Zuckerberg didn’t really need a prenuptial agreement to protect himself from a divorce, because he got rich before he got married, which was right after the offering. Shareholders got rich later: Facebook shares are up 247%. Let’s review: Trump was bearish on Apple AAPL, +0.01% in 2014 — “I sold my Apple” — because it didn’t match Samsung’s 005930, +1.27% big-screen phones, until it did. Apple shares since then are up 66%. Trump was bearish on Amazon.com AMZN, -0.40%   — “Jeff Bezos ... no-profit company” — in December 2015. The stock is up 25% since. Trump was wrong about Sony SNE, -1.93%  — “stupid leadership” — in December 2014 amid the now-ironic revelation of its hacked emails. Shares of Sony are up 58% since. Trump was wrong about American Airlines Group, panning its USAirways merger in 2013. Since then, American Airlines shares AAL, -5.32% have gained 241%. He’s been wrong about the New York Times Co. NYT, +0.38%  , which is up 4% since Trump called it a “dying paper” in 2016. Wrong about Gannett GCI, +0.41% and Tegna TGNA, +0.75% , the since-split-up publishers of “boring” USA Today, which have doubled in value since Trump tweeted in 2012 that he’d canceled his subscription to the newspaper. (Trump overlooked Gannett’s thriving TV business. Which is not, like, really smart! I worked for Gannett at the time — I made a ton.) Trump was wrong about Walt Disney DIS, +1.15%  , shares of which have doubled since drawing Trump’s ire in 2013 for apologizing after ESPN announcer Brent Musburger got a little too honest on air about the hotness of the girlfriend of the University of Alabama’s quarterback. Trump was wrong about Microsoft MSFT, +2.35%  , where he claimed unhappy investors were scheming to fire Bill Gates as chairman in 2013, when the stock was 90% lower. Trump was wrong about J.P. Morgan Chase JPM, +0.21% , shares of which are now 51% higher, for complaining that it settled lawsuits too easily.   This litany of wrongs goes on with Google parent Alphabet GOOG, -1.06%  , which Trump accused of suppressing negative news about Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. With Procter & Gamble PG, +0.14%  , Trump knocked it for moving its beauty business to Singapore in 2012, which P&G did for the eminently sensible reason that Asia was its fastest-growing market. P&G stock is up 36% Charter Communications CHTR, -2.88% was another miss. Trump in 2012 tweeted that the company gives bad service (“a disaster”). A disaster, that is, whose shares have quadrupled since. And T-Mobile US shares TMUS, -1.50% are up 96% since Trump said the same about that company in 2015. Want more? Trump was wrong about S&P Global SPGI, -0.36%  , which has tripled since Trump knocked the bond-rating agency for downgrading U.S. bonds in 2011, responding to the mostly Republican fiscal indiscipline — on which President Trump now plans to double down. If Trump gets what he wants on taxes, look for more feuding with S&P. He was wrong about Boeing BA, -0.84%  , criticizing the company in early December about the price of the next-generation Air Force One airplane. He was wrong about Lockheed Martin LMT, -0.58%  — shares rose in the days after he knocked the company over the cost of F-35 fighters on Dec. 22 and closed Thursday up about 1%. (Lockheed said Tuesday that it will not change its prices.) Based on the tremendous cost and cost overruns of the Lockheed Martin F-35, I have asked Boeing to price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 22, 2016 Trump has been wrong about the automobile industry, too. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles shares FCAU, +0.18% are up 235% since Trump’s 2012 prediction that the company would move Jeep production to China after that year’s election (wrong about that, too). But score one for Trump with Ford — down 22% since Trump hit the company in 2015 over Mexico, saying “the U.S. is getting killed.” Toyota Motor Corp. shares 7203, -0.89% TM, -1.92% didn’t move much after Trump’s tweet earlier this month about plans for a Corolla plant in Mexico, and General Motors, thought to be Trump’s favorite car and truck maker, is up 7% since he attacked it, half-accurately, on Jan. 3 over making Chevrolet Cruze hatchbacks south of the border (the more popular Cruze sedans come from Ohio). The reality is that there’s no discernible Trump effect on car stocks, except in the media’s eyes. Toyota Motor said will build a new plant in Baja, Mexico, to build Corolla cars for U.S. NO WAY! Build plant in U.S. or pay big border tax.— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 5, 2017 Finally, Trump was even wrong the bonds of Vattenfall, sponsor of a wind-power project Trump contends ruins views from one of his Scottish golf courses. “Who would be stupid enough to invest?” Trump tweeted in May 2015. Answer: People who like a 15% capital gain. Plus 6.875% interest. Really, none of this should be a yuuuge surprise, given that Trump and his team have been lying about everything from voters to the size of the president’s ... crowds. But what is surprising, and counter to the hype, is the quantitative proof that the market’s Big Blond Wolf is breath-deprived. Lockheed, for one, is apparently reasoning that if a company is solidly built, Trump can blow all he wants. Other companies, take heed.

The president now is aiming at auto companies, trying to bludgeon Ford F, +0.97%  , General Motors GM, -1.36% and Toyota TM, -1.92% into expanding small-car production in the U.S. — reversing decades-old trends of moving the manufacturing of mostly lower-priced, often-unprofitable cars to Mexico, even as Mexican presidents past and present flip The Donald the bird. Stop quaking. Trump’s Twitter TWTR, -1.43% missives have no lasting effect on stocks. I created a list of affected companies, generated by Yahoo Finance, then deleted the privately owned ones. This left 37 public companies about which Trump has tweeted nastygrams since 2012. Trump has been wrong, from an investing standpoint, on 29 of them. In fact, if you shorted 100 shares of each of these 37 companies on the day Trump slammed them, you’re down 37% as of Thursday’s close. Sad! What does this tell us? Investors and CEOs should pay no attention to the man behind the curtain. The tweeter-in-chief can huff and puff, but he can’t blow your house down. Investors don’t care what he tweets, and the record shows they’re right not to. It’s amusing to see the breadth of businesses Trump is wrong about. He’s wrong about tech. Wrong about media, mainstream or otherwise. Wrong about wind power. Wrong about Coca-Cola KO, -0.86%  , Warren Buffett and ESPN. Wrong about Hollywood. Wrong about markets and policy. Wrong about cellphone companies. And atop all this wrongness is Trump’s pan of Facebook’s FB, -0.45% 2012 initial public offering (“hard to believe it could be worth that much”), which came with unsolicited marital advice for founder Mark Zuckerberg — “Get a prenup!” Here's why tech giants want to keep content cheap(2:18) Harvard Business School professor Bharat Anand explains why cheap digital content - from unlimited music and video streaming, to free online document processors and cheap e-books - actually helps tech giants make money. Maybe because I went to high school with the paparazzo who got the famous shot of Trump’s first two wives squaring off on the ski slopes, the thought of the first three-times-married president doling out both marital and stock advice in the same 140 characters is hilarious. Lawyers, by the way, say Zuckerberg didn’t really need a prenuptial agreement to protect himself from a divorce, because he got rich before he got married, which was right after the offering. Shareholders got rich later: Facebook shares are up 247%. Let’s review: Trump was bearish on Apple AAPL, +0.01% in 2014 — “I sold my Apple” — because it didn’t match Samsung’s 005930, +1.27% big-screen phones, until it did. Apple shares since then are up 66%. Trump was bearish on Amazon.com AMZN, -0.40%   — “Jeff Bezos ... no-profit company” — in December 2015. The stock is up 25% since. Trump was wrong about Sony SNE, -1.93%  — “stupid leadership” — in December 2014 amid the now-ironic revelation of its hacked emails. Shares of Sony are up 58% since. Trump was wrong about American Airlines Group, panning its USAirways merger in 2013. Since then, American Airlines shares AAL, -5.32% have gained 241%. He’s been wrong about the New York Times Co. NYT, +0.38%  , which is up 4% since Trump called it a “dying paper” in 2016. Wrong about Gannett GCI, +0.41% and Tegna TGNA, +0.75% , the since-split-up publishers of “boring” USA Today, which have doubled in value since Trump tweeted in 2012 that he’d canceled his subscription to the newspaper. (Trump overlooked Gannett’s thriving TV business. Which is not, like, really smart! I worked for Gannett at the time — I made a ton.) Trump was wrong about Walt Disney DIS, +1.15%  , shares of which have doubled since drawing Trump’s ire in 2013 for apologizing after ESPN announcer Brent Musburger got a little too honest on air about the hotness of the girlfriend of the University of Alabama’s quarterback. Trump was wrong about Microsoft MSFT, +2.35%  , where he claimed unhappy investors were scheming to fire Bill Gates as chairman in 2013, when the stock was 90% lower. Trump was wrong about J.P. Morgan Chase JPM, +0.21% , shares of which are now 51% higher, for complaining that it settled lawsuits too easily.   This litany of wrongs goes on with Google parent Alphabet GOOG, -1.06%  , which Trump accused of suppressing negative news about Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. With Procter & Gamble PG, +0.14%  , Trump knocked it for moving its beauty business to Singapore in 2012, which P&G did for the eminently sensible reason that Asia was its fastest-growing market. P&G stock is up 36% Charter Communications CHTR, -2.88% was another miss. Trump in 2012 tweeted that the company gives bad service (“a disaster”). A disaster, that is, whose shares have quadrupled since. And T-Mobile US shares TMUS, -1.50% are up 96% since Trump said the same about that company in 2015. Want more? Trump was wrong about S&P Global SPGI, -0.36%  , which has tripled since Trump knocked the bond-rating agency for downgrading U.S. bonds in 2011, responding to the mostly Republican fiscal indiscipline — on which President Trump now plans to double down. If Trump gets what he wants on taxes, look for more feuding with S&P. He was wrong about Boeing BA, -0.84%  , criticizing the company in early December about the price of the next-generation Air Force One airplane. He was wrong about Lockheed Martin LMT, -0.58%  — shares rose in the days after he knocked the company over the cost of F-35 fighters on Dec. 22 and closed Thursday up about 1%. (Lockheed said Tuesday that it will not change its prices.) Based on the tremendous cost and cost overruns of the Lockheed Martin F-35, I have asked Boeing to price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 22, 2016 Trump has been wrong about the automobile industry, too. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles shares FCAU, +0.18% are up 235% since Trump’s 2012 prediction that the company would move Jeep production to China after that year’s election (wrong about that, too). But score one for Trump with Ford — down 22% since Trump hit the company in 2015 over Mexico, saying “the U.S. is getting killed.” Toyota Motor Corp. shares 7203, -0.89% TM, -1.92% didn’t move much after Trump’s tweet earlier this month about plans for a Corolla plant in Mexico, and General Motors, thought to be Trump’s favorite car and truck maker, is up 7% since he attacked it, half-accurately, on Jan. 3 over making Chevrolet Cruze hatchbacks south of the border (the more popular Cruze sedans come from Ohio). The reality is that there’s no discernible Trump effect on car stocks, except in the media’s eyes. Toyota Motor said will build a new plant in Baja, Mexico, to build Corolla cars for U.S. NO WAY! Build plant in U.S. or pay big border tax.— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 5, 2017 Finally, Trump was even wrong the bonds of Vattenfall, sponsor of a wind-power project Trump contends ruins views from one of his Scottish golf courses. “Who would be stupid enough to invest?” Trump tweeted in May 2015. Answer: People who like a 15% capital gain. Plus 6.875% interest. Really, none of this should be a yuuuge surprise, given that Trump and his team have been lying about everything from voters to the size of the president’s ... crowds. But what is surprising, and counter to the hype, is the quantitative proof that the market’s Big Blond Wolf is breath-deprived. Lockheed, for one, is apparently reasoning that if a company is solidly built, Trump can blow all he wants. Other companies, take heed.

The ad is Mr. Clean’s first Super Bowl spot, and it will air during the big game on Feb. 5. In an interview with Ad Age, P&G exec Martin Hettich said the commercial was targeted at couples and takes aim at how they divide up household chores. “There’s a clear disconnect between what men say they’re doing and what they’re actually doing,” Hettich said, citing an internal study of heterosexual couples that found only 17 percent of households equally shared chore responsibilities, despite the fact that most men thought they did half the chores.  Perhaps if men pitched in, women would have more time for... other activities. In fact, a 2015 study from the University of Alberta found that heterosexual couples had better and more frequent sex when men chipped in with the chores.   Watch the ad in the video above.

Your email address will not be published. Required fields are marked * Name * Email * Website two  ×   =  two Comment Some HTML is OK Sign me up for the Money Morning newsletter The Dow Jones Industrial Average today was sliding as President Donald Trump prepares for his first full week in office. The markets are still digesting Trump's protectionist inaugural address, which pledged to put "America first" through a process of buying American products and hiring American workers. Trump has promised to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and said he plans to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership. On Friday, the Dow gained 94 points on the first day of Donald Trump's presidency. Proctor & Gamble Co. (NYSE: PG) gave the biggest boost to the Dow after the conglomerate easily beat Wall Street expectations for its quarterly report. However, General Electric Co. (NYSE: GE) stock slipped after the firm matched earnings expectations but fell short of revenue forecasts. Let's look at the numbers from Friday for the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq: Dow Jones: 19,827.25; +94.85; +0.48% S&P 500: 2,271.31; +7.62.; +0.34% Nasdaq: 5,555.33; +15.25; +0.28% Here's a look at today's most important market events and stocks, plus a look at Monday's economic calendar. What's Ahead for the Dow Jones Industrial Average Today The Dow Jones Industrial Average projected a 19-point decline ahead of a busy day of earnings reports and speculation on the Trump administration's economic policies. Despite increased expectations for corporate tax reform and deregulation, investors are concerned about protectionist policies and their impact on global trade. President Trump's inaugural address Friday stirred up fears of protectionism after he said that his policies will endorse the "Buy American, Hire American" motto. Trending: A 2017 Stock Market Outlook You Won't Get Anywhere Else Many investors appear to be taking a "wait and see" approach with the Trump administration before they make and big, bold predictions. But Money Morning Technical Trading Specialist D.R. Barton says that you can make a lot of money due to other people's uncertainty. Barton sat down with Money Morning Executive Editor Bill Patalon to discuss on such trade this weekend. Check out out how you can make money this week, right here. Crude oil prices were falling Monday as increased production levels in the United States overshadowed supply cuts by OPEC. During a meeting among OPEC and non-OPEC producers over the weekend, the global oil cartel said they have taken roughly 1.5 million barrels per day off the market. However, on Friday, Baker Hughes Inc. (NYSE: BHI) reported the largest weekly increase in domestic production rigs in nearly four months. U.S. oil production is now up roughly 6% since mid-2016. The WTI crude oil price today fell 1.4%. Brent crude dipped 1.1%. Don't Miss: We Predict Natural Gas Prices in 2017 Will Soar Double Digits Money Morning Global Energy Strategist Dr. Kent Moors expects both oil and natural gas prices to continue rising by at least 20% in 2017. With energy prices set to climb, investors should read about our three best energy stocks to own in 2017. Check them out, right here. But the big story is the Affordable Care Act. On Friday, President Donald Trump signed an executive order starting the process of repealing Obamacare. The new president is expected to begin working with Congress this week to provide an alternative to former President Barack Obama's signature healthcare law. Stocks to Watch Today, Jan. 23, 2017 Shares of United Continental Holdings Inc. (NYSE: UAL) were back in focus after yet another computer glitch forced the grounding of all flights Sunday evening. The company paid for all change fees and issued travel waivers to customers. However, thousands of travelers took to social media and battered the firm on Twitter Inc. (NYSE: TWTR) and Facebook Inc. (Nasdaq: FB). In earnings news, McDonald's Corp. (NYSE: MCD) stock was up 0.8% after the company reported fourth-quarter earnings. Despite expectations that the company faced poor winter weather and slow traffic in December, the firm topped earnings, revenue, and same-store sales expectations. For the quarter, McDonald's reported an EPS of $1.45 on top of $6.05 billion in revenue. Analysts anticipated an EPS of $1.41 on top of $5.99 billion in revenue. Meanwhile, shares of Halliburton Co. (NYSE: HAL) fell 0.4% after the company fell short of quarterly revenue expectations and reported losses of $5.7 billion. The sharp downturn came after the company failed to acquire Baker Hughes Inc. (NYSE: BHI) due to regulatory scrutiny. The firm has also been under pressure due to the two-year downturn on global oil prices. Keep an eye out for additional earnings reports from Yahoo! Inc. (Nasdaq: YHOO), Brown & Brown Inc.

Multinationals The retreat of the global company The biggest business idea of the past three decades is in deep trouble Jan 28th 2017 Add this article to your reading list by clicking this button Tweet IT WAS as though the world had a new appetite. A Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC) outlet opened near Tiananmen Square in 1987. In 1990 a McDonald’s sprang up in Pushkin Square, flipping burgers for 30,000 Muscovites on its first day. Later that year Ronald McDonald rolled into Shenzhen, China, too. Between 1990 and 2005 the two companies’ combined foreign sales soared by 400%. McDonald’s and KFC embodied an idea that would become incredibly powerful: global firms, run by global managers and owned by global shareholders, should sell global products to global customers. For a long time their planet-straddling model was as hot, crisp and moreish as their fries.  Related topics Europe Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development Apple United Kingdom Economic development Today both companies have gone soggy. Their shares have lagged behind America’s stockmarket over the past half-decade. Yum, which owns KFC, saw its foreign profits peak in 2012; they have fallen by 20% since. Those of McDonald’s are down by 29% since 2013 (see article). Last year Yum threw in the towel in China and spun off its business there. On January 8th McDonald’s sold a majority stake in its Chinese operation to a state-owned firm. There are specific reasons for some of this; but there is also a broader trend. The world is losing its taste for global businesses. Their detractors and their champions both think of multinational firms—for the purposes of this article, firms that make over 30% of their sales outside their home region (unless otherwise specified)—as the apex predators of the global economy. They shape the ecosystems in which others seek their living. They direct the flows of goods, services and capital that brought globalisation to life. Though multinationals account for only 2% of the world’s jobs, they own or orchestrate the supply chains that account for over 50% of world trade; they make up 40% of the value of the West’s stockmarkets; and they own most of the world’s intellectual property. Although the idea of being at the top of the food chain makes these companies sound ruthless and all-conquering, rickety and overextended are often more fitting adjectives. And like jackals circling an elderly pride, politicians want to grab more of the spoils that multinational firms have come to control, including 80m jobs on their payrolls and their profits of about $1trn. As multinational firms come to make ever more of their money from technology services they become yet more vulnerable to a backlash. The predators are increasingly coming to look like prey. It all looked very different 25 years ago. With the Soviet Union collapsing and China opening up, a sense of destiny gripped Western firms; the “end of history” announced by Francis Fukuyama, a scholar, in which all countries would converge towards democracy and capitalism seemed both a historical turning-point and a huge opportunity. There were already many multinationals, some long established. Shell, Coca-Cola and Unilever had histories spanning the 20th century. But they had been run, for the most part, as loose federations of national businesses. The new multinationals sought to be truly global. Companies became obsessed with internationalising their customers, production, capital and management. Academics draw distinctions between going global “vertically”—relocating production and the sourcing of raw materials—and “horizontally”—selling into new markets. But in practice many firms went global every which way at once, enthusiastically buying rivals, courting customers and opening factories wherever the opportunity arose. Though the trend started in the rich world, it soon caught on among large companies in developing economies, too. And it was huge: 85% of the global stock of multinational investment was created after 1990, after adjusting for inflation (see chart 1). By 2006 Sam Palmisano, the boss of IBM, was arguing that the “globally integrated enterprise” run as a unitary organisation, rather than as a federation, would transcend all borders as it sought “the integration of production and value delivery worldwide”. From the Seattle demonstrations of 1999 onwards, anti-globalisation activists had been saying much the same, while drawing less solace from the prospect. The only business star to resist the orthodoxy was Warren Buffett; he sought out monopolies at home instead. Such a spree could not last forever; an increasing body of evidence suggests that it has now ended. In 2016 multinationals’ cross-border investment probably fell by 10-15%. Impressive as the share of trade accounted for by cross-border supply chains is, it has stagnated since 2007 (see chart 2). The proportion of sales that Western firms make outside their home region has shrunk. Multinationals’ profits are falling and the flow of new multinational investment has been declining relative to GDP. The global firm is in retreat. The other end of the end of history To understand why this is, consider the three parties that made the boom possible: investors; the “headquarters countries” in which global firms are domiciled; and the “host countries” that received multinational investment. For their different reasons each thought that multinational firms would provide superior financial or economic performance. Investors saw a huge potential for economies of scale. As China, India and the Soviet Union opened up, and as Europe liberalised itself into a single market, firms could sell the same product to more people. And as the federation model was replaced by global integration, firms would be able to fine-tune the mix of inputs they got from around the world—a geographic arbitrage that would improve efficiency, as Martin Reeves of BCG, a consultancy, puts it. From the rich world they could get management, capital, brands and technology. From the emerging world they could get cheap workers and raw materials as well as lighter rules on pollution. These advantages led investors to think global firms would grow faster and make higher profits. That was true for a while. It is not true today. The profits of the top 700-odd multinational firms based in the rich world have dropped by 25% over the past five years, according to FTSE, an index firm. The weakness of many currencies against the dollar is part of the story, but explains only a third of the fall. The profits of domestic firms rose by 2%. A complementary measure comes from the foreign profits of all firms as recorded in balance-of-payments statistics. Though the data refer to firms of all sizes, big ones dominate the mix. For companies with headquarters in the OECD, a club of mostly rich countries, foreign profits are down by 17% over five years. American firms suffered less, with a 12% drop, partly because of their skew towards the fast-growing technology sector. For non-American firms the drop was 20%. Profits should be compared with the capital sunk. The return on equity (ROE) of the top 700 multinationals has dropped from a peak of 18% a decade ago to 11%. The returns on the foreign operations of all firms have fallen, too, based on balance-of-payments statistics. For the three countries which have, historically, hosted the most and biggest multinationals, America, Britain and the Netherlands, ROE on foreign investment has shrunk to 4-8%. The trend is similar across the OECD (see chart 3). Multinationals based in emerging economies, which account for about a seventh of global firms’ overall activity, have fared no better: their worldwide ROE is 8%. Several supposed champions—such as Lenovo, the Chinese company which bought IBM’s PC business and parts of Motorola—have been financial flops. China’s biggest completed cross-border acquisition was of Nexen, a Canadian oil firm, in 2012. Last year the buyer, CNOOC, a state-owned energy firm, wrote a chunk of it off. About half of the deterioration in multinationals’ ROE over the past 5-10 years is explained by the slump in commodity prices, and thus the profits of oil firms, mining firms and the like. Another 10% of the deterioration is due to banks. Firms that provide the specialist services behind globalisation have also been hammered. Profits have dropped by over 50% from their peak at Maersk, a Danish shipping line, Mitsui, a Japanese trading house, and Li & Fung, a supply-chain agent for retailers. The pain extends beyond these core industries, however. Half of all big multinationals have seen their ROE fall in the past three years; 40% fail to make an ROE of over 10%, widely seen as a benchmark of whether a firm is creating any value worth speaking of. Even at powerhouses such as Unilever, General Electric (GE), PepsiCo and Procter & Gamble, foreign profits are down by a quarter or more from their peak. The only bright spot is the technology giants. Their foreign profits comprise 46% of the total foreign earnings of the top 50 American multinationals, up from 17% a decade ago. Apple made $46bn abroad last year, more than any other firm and five times more than GE, often seen as America’s bellwether. These figures mean multinationals are no longer achieving superior performance. The Economist has examined the record of the 500 largest firms worldwide. In eight out of ten sectors, multinational firms have expanded their aggregate sales more slowly than their domestic peers. In six out of the ten sectors they have lower ROEs (see chart 4). For American firms, returns are now 30% higher in their home market, where cosy oligopoly has become more enticing than the hurly-burly of an unruly world. Individual bosses will often blame one-off factors: currency moves, the collapse of Venezuela, a depression in Europe, a crackdown on graft in China, and so on. But the deeper explanation is that both the advantages of scale and those of arbitrage have worn away. Global firms have big overheads; complex supply chains tie up inventory; sprawling organisations are hard to run. Some arbitrage opportunities have been exhausted; wages have risen in China; and most firms have massaged their tax bills as low as they can go. The free flow of information means that competitors can catch up with leads in technology and know-how more easily than they used to. As a result firms with a domestic focus are winning market share. In Brazil two local banks, Itaú and Bradesco, have trounced global lenders. In India Vodafone, a Western mobile-phone operator and Bharti Airtel, an Indian multinational active in 20 countries, are losing customers to Reliance, a domestic firm. In America shale firms stole a march on the global oil majors. In China local dumpling brands are eating into KFC’s sales. A blend of measures for listed firms shows that multinationals’ share of global profits, 35% a decade ago, is now only 30%. So much for the investors. What about the second constituency for multinationals, the “headquarters countries”? In the 1990s and 2000s they wanted their national champions to go global in order to become bigger and brainier. A study by McKinsey, a consultancy, based on 2007 data, outlined the sort of benefits they were after. Multinationals operating in America, which accounted for 19% of private-sector jobs, were responsible for 25% of private wages, 25% of profits, 48% of exports and 74% of research and development. Go them. Citizens of nowhere The mood changed after the financial crisis. Multinational firms started to be seen as agents of inequality. They created jobs abroad, but not at home. Between 2009 and 2013, only 5%, or 400,000, of the net jobs created in America were created by multinational firms domiciled there (although preliminary figures suggest that job creation picked up sharply in 2014). The profits from their hoards of intellectual property were pocketed by a wealthy shareholder elite. Political willingness to help multinationals duly lapsed. As a result, the tapestry of rules designed to help businesses globally is fraying. Global accounting, antitrust, money-laundering and bank-capital rules have splintered into American and European camps. Takeovers of Western firms now often come with strings attached by governments to safeguard local jobs and plants. Two American-led trade deals, known as TPP and TTIP, that gave protection to intellectual property, have flopped. The global tribunals that multinationals use to bypass national courts have come under attack. The deep roots of globalisation mean that trying to favour domestic companies by erecting tariffs no longer works as once it did. Over half of all exports, measured by value, cross a border at least twice before reaching the end-customer, so such tariffs hurt all alike. This does not mean that the inept or ignorant will not try them. But it does encourage the use of other avenues to try and right perceived wrongs, such as the tax system and good old political muscle. A typical multinational has over 500 legal entities, some based in tax havens. Using American figures, it pays a tax rate of about 10% on its foreign profits. The European Union (EU) is trying to raise that figure. It has cracked down on Luxembourg, which offered generous deals to multinationals that parked profits there; it also hit Apple with a $15bn penalty for breaching state-aid rules by booking profits in Ireland, with which it had a bespoke tax deal. America, for its part, has barred big firms from using legal “inversions” to shift their tax base abroad, most notably in the case of Pfizer, a pharmaceutical company that is America’s third-largest foreign earner. Republicans in Congress are debating changes to the tax code which would see exporters and firms bringing profits home pay less than before, while firms shifting production abroad would face levies. Meanwhile, some firms have apparently been browbeaten into outsourcing decisions about where to base factories by Donald Trump, the new American president. On January 3rd Ford, a carmaker, agreed to cancel a new plant in Mexico and invest more at home. Mr Trump also wants Apple to shift more of its supply chain home. If these trends continue global firms’ tax and wage bills will rise, squeezing profits further. If American multinationals shifted a quarter of their foreign jobs home, at American wage rates, and paid the same tax rate abroad as they did at home, their profits would fall by another 12%. This excludes the cost of building the new plants in America. Of all those involved in the spread of global businesses, the “host countries” that receive investment by multinationals remain the most enthusiastic. The example of China, where by 2010 30% of industrial output and 50% of exports were produced by the subsidiaries or joint-ventures of multinational firms, is still attractive. Argentina’s government wants to draw in foreign firms. Mexico has just sold stakes in its oilfields to foreign firms, including ExxonMobil and Total. India has a campaign called “make in India” to attract multinational supply chains. An index through which the OECD seeks to gauge the openness of host countries shows no overall deterioration since the financial crisis. But there are gathering clouds. China has been turning the screws on foreign firms in a push for “indigenous innovation”. Bosses say that more products have to be sourced locally and intellectual property often ends up handed over to local partners. Strategic industries, including the internet, are out of bounds to foreign investment. Many fear that China’s approach will be mimicked around the developing world, forcing multinational firms to invest more locally and create more jobs—a mirror image of the pressures placed on them at home. The price of hospitality Host countries may also become less welcoming as activity shifts towards intangible services. For the top 50 American multinationals, 65% of foreign profits now come from industries reliant on intellectual property, such as technology, drug patents and finance. A decade ago it was 35%, and the share is still rising. (It is much lower in Europe and Japan, which do not have big technology firms.) There is no serious appetite among multinationals to recreate in Africa or India the manufacturing centres they spurred on in China, which removes a reason for those host countries to welcome them. The jobs and exports that can be attributed to multinationals are already a diminishing part of the story. In 2000 every billion dollars of the stock of worldwide foreign investment represented 7,000 jobs and $600m of annual exports. Today $1bn supports 3,000 jobs and $300m of exports. Silicon Valley’s latest stars are already controversial abroad. In 2016 Uber sold its Chinese operations to a local rival after a brutal battle. In December India’s two digital champions, Ola, a ride-hailing firm, and Flipkart, an e-commerce site, said the government should protect them against Uber and Amazon. They argued that their rivals would build monopolies, create few good jobs and ship the profits to America. The last time the multinational company was in trouble was in the aftermath of the Depression. Between 1930 and 1970 their stock of investment abroad fell by about a third relative to global GDP; it did not recover until 1991. Some firms “hopped” across tariffs by building new factories within protectionist countries. Many restructured, ceding autonomy to their foreign subsidiaries to try to give them a local character. Others decided to break themselves up. Today multinationals need to rethink their competitive advantage again. Some of the old arguments for going global are obsolete—in part because of the more general successes of globalisation. Most multinationals do not act as internal markets for trade. Only a third of their output is now bought by affiliates in the same group. External supply chains do the rest. Multinational firms no longer have a lock on the most promising ideas about management or innovation. Where they have enforceable patents over valuable brands they are still at an advantage, as they are in products, such as jet engines, where economies of scale are best created by spreading costs over the entire world. But those benefits are less than they were. The lack of advantage is revealed in the amount of activity that yields little value. Roughly 50% of the stock of foreign direct investment makes an ROE of less than 10% (40% of the stock if you exclude natural-resources firms). Ford and General Motors make 80% or more of their profits in North America, suggesting their foreign returns are abysmal. Many industries that tried to globalise seem to work best when national or regional. For some, the penny has dropped. Retailers such as Britain’s Tesco and France’s Casino have abandoned many of their foreign adventures. America’s telecoms giants, AT&T and Verizon, have put away their passports. Financial firms are focusing on their “core” markets. LafargeHolcim, a cement maker, plans to sell, or has sold, businesses in India, South Korea, Saudi Arabia and Vietnam. Even successful global firms have gone on diets. P&G’s foreign sales have dropped by almost a third since 2012 as it has closed or sold weak businesses. It looks as if, in the future, the global business scene will have three elements. A smaller top tier of multinational firms will burrow deeper into the economies of their hosts, helping to assuage nationalistic concerns. General Electric is localising its production, supply chains and management. Emerson, a conglomerate that has over 100 factories outside America, sources about 80% of its production in the region where it is sold. Some foreign firms will invest more deeply in American-based production in order to avoid tariffs, if Mr Trump imposes them, much as Japanese car firms did in the 1980s. This is doable if you are large. Siemens, a German industrial giant, employs 50,000 in America and has 60 factories there. But midsized industrial firms will struggle to muster the resources to invest more deeply in all their markets. Politicians will increasingly insist that companies buying foreign firms promise to preserve their national character, including jobs, R&D activity and tax payments. SoftBank, a Japanese firm that bought ARM, a British chip company, in 2016, agreed to such commitments. So has Sinochem, a Chinese chemicals firm that is buying Syngenta, a Swiss rival. The boom in foreign takeovers by Chinese firms, meanwhile, may fizzle out or explode. Many such deals, reliant on subsidised loans from state banks, probably make little financial sense. The second element will be a brittle layer of global digital and intellectual-property multinationals: technology firms, such as Google and Netflix; drugs companies; and companies that use franchising deals with local firms as a cheap way to maintain a global footprint and the market advantage that brings. The hotel industry, with its large branding firms such as Hilton and Intercontinental, is a prime example of the tactic. McDonald’s is shifting to a franchising model in Asia. These intangible multinationals will grow fast. But because they create few direct jobs, often involve oligopolies and do not benefit from the protection of global trade rules, which for the most part only look after physical goods, they will be vulnerable to nationalist backlashes. The seeds of something more The final element will be perhaps the most interesting: a rising cohort of small firms using e-commerce to buy and sell on a global scale. Up to 10% of America’s 30m or so small firms already do this to some extent. PayPal, a digital payments firm, says its cross border transactions, which include activity from such multinationalettes, are running at $80bn a year, and growing fast. Jack Ma, the boss of Alibaba, a Chinese e-commerce firm, predicts that a wave of small Western firms exporting goods to Chinese consumers will go some way to reversing the past two decades of massive American firms importing goods from China. The new, prudent age of the multinational will have costs. Countries that have grown used to global firms throwing cash around may find that competition abates and prices rise. Investors, who all told have a third or more of their equity portfolios tied up in multinational firms, could face some unpleasant turbulence. Economies that rely on income from foreign investments, or capital inflows from new ones, will suffer. The collapse in profits from British multinationals is the reason why Britain’s balance of payments looks bad. Of the 15 countries with current-account deficits of over 2.5% of GDP in 2015, 11 relied on fresh multinational investment to finance at least a third of the gap. The result will be a more fragmented and parochial kind of capitalism, and quite possibly a less efficient one—but also, perhaps, one with wider public support. And the infatuation with global companies will come to be seen as a passing episode in business history, rather than its end.

Entertainment brands often go overlooked by the broader business community as innovators. Not because they don't innovate, but perhaps because it seems innovation is a given when you're in the business of entertaining people. Indeed, many innovations in contemporary digital life have roots in the entertainment business. The growth of video games led to an explosion in mobile gaming, and in the gamification of digital marketing. The standardization of high definition video — and increasing access to the software and equipment necessary to produce it — led to a boom in video content production; something many content marketers have prioritized in recent years. But beyond major tech advancements, entertainment marketing is shaping up to evolve in a few more subtle ways. Content Like many marketers in more standard businesses verticals, marketers in the entertainment industry have wrestled with the digital paradigm shift of enhanced consumer empowerment. For many marketers, content and data are two of the most powerful tools on hand to foster engagement with empowered consumers, but for the entertainment industry, the tides seem to be shifting not just toward creating optimized content, but optimized high quality content. It almost seems silly to say that making good content will be essential to entertainment marketing in the future. But in many ways quality has been subservient to economics in the broad entertainment world. Any brand with a billion bucks could throw money at a critically panned film like any of the Transformers movies and make lots of money. But with word of mouth and sentiment proliferating at the rates they are on social media, mediocre work is being increasingly called out as such. Beyond quality, though, lies the challenge of cross platform distribution. “The biggests successes will be people who understand the content they have to utilize, and how they can extend that content into other forms and fashions,” says Andrew Carvella, VP of strategy and brand engagement at Sprout Social. “Whether a film or TV show or video game, what are the things they can use as a brand to… extend the opportunities and create more opportunities for people to engage with their content across channels?” Entertainers have some of the most virally successful content on the web, but unlike the old days, successful content cannot live on one channel alone. Take some of the highly popular segments from late night TV. Both Jimmy Kimmel and James Corden — two of the most popular names in late night TV — have essentially memed segments of their show for the web to huge success. Corden's “Carpool Karaoke” videos routinely go viral, as do Kimmel's various “Mean Tweets” clips. Scale As big as brands like Coke or P&G are, their audience of engaged fans pales in comparison to that of entertainment juggernauts like Star Wars, any NBA or NFL team, or games like Overwatch or Call of Duty. While this dynamic is unlikely to change, it's important to appreciate the challenge many leading names in entertainment have in engaging these legions of fans. Indeed, engagement on such a scale may even be impossible. This is less of an issue for big brands like Disney or Warner Brothers, who have such strong followings that engagement isn't a pressing concern. But the scale vs. engagement debate will be very real indeed for new creators going forward. “Massive communities are important and can be great, but if you have an engaged following, even if it's a smaller community or viewership, then you're able to manage that engagement really well,” Carvella says. Entertainers of tomorrow are going to have to prioritize channels like social media and online forums and communities to bring audiences into the process on as many levels as possible. From behind the scenes live streams on social, to using live streaming itself as part of a growth strategy, entertainment brands, at once, have more options for fan engagement, and more obstacles to managing all of the various mediums. Another thing to consider in terms of audience is the role that influencer marketing will play in growing and retaining followings for entertainment brands. In many cases today, brands like Disney will work with influencers like PewdiePie in ways that mutually benefit each party. As familiar as such relationships sound, in entertainment, big brands have largely worked through influencers more so than with them. “[For] brands trying to evolve their thinking or strategies, it was acceptable to take your TV ad and amplify it on a creator's or influencer's channel or get them to make it for you,” says Ben Lister, COO of media at XTreme Video. “Now there is a far more longer term vision...We're now seeing a lot of influencers and brands creating huge profiles on social media. We've reached that tipping point where people are looking at how to engage their target audience better.” Brands and influencers will increasingly see reciprocal gains by working with one or the other in cases where the audiences have strong overlap. Disney is particularly notable here, given it's $500 million distribution deal with big YouTube gaming channels like PewDiePie and Total Biscuit. Format Video is now a huge component of the entertainment and entertainment marketing. So, while businesses are clamoring to find use cases for emerging imaging technology like augmented and virtual reality, 360 degree video, and to a lesser extent live streaming, many brands in the entertainment sector have products and content ready made for these experimental formats. In many ways, the most immediately fascinating aspect of speculating on the future of entertainment marketing is how these brands are going to set up use cases that those in the broader business world will look to for inspiration and validation. The key lies in the unifying theme of all the various experimental video formats: immersion. “We're quite interested in even the very basic live Q&As with athletes [in 360 live videos],” Lister says. “It's important for people like us to really try things out and seeing how these [formats] work in the market, and take that feedback back into the world where we're dealing with broadcasters and brands.” Welcome to Future Week,a week at DMN where we're straining to look beyond the event horizon See all of the pieces here.

By Brian Koerber2017-01-27 20:42:08 UTC We all know the bald cleaning man, Mr. Clean. But the new and (improved?) Mr. Clean is bringing things to a whole new level of sexy. The 30-second spot slated to air during the third quarter of the Super Bowl features a sexed-up CGI Mr. Clean that will surely make you feel something. Whether that's turned on or creeped out depends entirely on how attractive you find CGI character, or bald old dudes with white eyebrows and one earring that love to clean and shake their ass in the process.  Proctor and Gamble recently announced that the hunt for their real-life Mr. Clean is over, but we can all agree that the CGI version is weird as hell.

SUBSCRIBE Opinion: Mr. Clean’s Super Bowl ad may get buzz, but does it cross the ‘creepy’ line? The brand tries to pull off a seductive Mr. Clean, but some viewers may find the iconic character comes off more scary than dreamy. Amy Gesenhues on January 27, 2017 at 9:00 am More After posting a teaser ad earlier this week with “stranger-danger” vibes all over it, Mr. Clean has released its official “Cleaner of Your Dreams” Super Bowl LI spot — and it features Mr. Clean in a whole new light, seductively dancing as he mops floors and scrubs the shower. The brand is obviously using the sex-sells angle to get more buzz. But does the ad make Mr. Clean out to be more of a predator than the cleaner of your dreams? Taking the “not suitable for work” route in a Super Bowl campaign is as new as drinking beer and eating nachos during the game. There has never been a shortage of Super Bowl spots using sex to sell on TV’s biggest night for advertisers. GoDaddy made its name on controversial Super Bowl spots with the likes of race car driver Danica Patrick and Victoria Secrets model Bar Refaeli. In 2015, Carl Jr.’s Super Bowl ad showcased a nearly naked model strolling through the town center, talking about how she loves, “… going all natural,” to sell the fast food restaurant’s all-natural grass-fed beef burgers. Three years ago Nestlé launched its Butterfinger Cups product in a Super Bowl ad oozing with sexual innuendo. Mr. Clean can now add its name to the list of Super Bowl brands that have pushed the envelope, but this campaign feels different from your run-of-the-mill sex-sells advertising effort. The brand’s aim — to create a seductive male who will dance his way into every housewife’s heart (or better, bedroom) — falls short. Instead of being someone women find sexy, Mr. Clean comes across more like someone men think women would find sexy — but, in reality, elicits the very opposite effect. Starting with the way he ogles the woman as she pulls loose her ponytail in the brand’s 10-second teaser ad, Mr. Clean isn’t seductive — he’s the guy you avoid making eye contact with in the grocery store cereal aisle. But then, the brand drives it home in the full spot, as Mr. Clean forcefully bangs down his cleaning supplies in front of the woman, and then eerily stares at her from the other side of the glass shower door. I get it. The ad is supposed to be funny, and sexy, in a “Fifty Shades of Grey” meets Schneider from “One Day at a Time” kind of way. It’s possible that I am in the minority when it comes to females who find this Mr. Clean more icky than enticing — but the not-suitable-for-work vibe the brand is pushing comes across tired to me. In addition to making its iconic Mr. Clean character a creepy, tight-fitting-white-jeans-wearing, Magic Mike reject, what I find most offensive is the turn it takes at the end, when Mr. Clean ends up being a man — presumably the woman’s husband — with an exaggerated “Dad bod” who asks, “… is it clean enough?” The scene is immediately followed by the line, “You gotta love a man who cleans.” Really? In 2017, a man who cleans is so much of a rarity that we’re making him into a sex object? As someone who is most likely dead-center of the demographic Procter & Gamble is aiming to reach — a middle-aged female (in case I didn’t already date myself with the “One Day at a Time” reference), mother of two, wife and professional — I find the campaign bewildering. This Mr. Clean is far from the cleaner of my dreams. He’s a nightmare. I reached out to two other female friends of the same age (and similar 1970s sitcom watching history) as me. The first said she thought the ad was insulting to both women and men. The other called it gross. It was an extremely small pool of like-minded women, but the poll results were the same. What do you think? Is Super Bowl LI’s Mr. Clean someone you want mopping your floors? Or would you lock the front door if you saw him standing on your porch? Tell us if you find him more creepy than sexy — or is it just another funny Super Bowl ad — on Marketing Land’s Facebook page.

Google Dance returns to SMX West in March Subscribe to SearchCap SUBSCRIBE SEO SEM Mobile Local Retail Google Bing Social Home SEO Everything you need to know about SEO, delivered every Thursday. SUBSCRIBE Do organic keyword rankings matter anymore? With all the ways search engine results pages have evolved over the years, columnist Julian Connors explores the question of whether SEO is still a wise investment. Julian Connors on January 26, 2017 at 11:58 am More High keyword rankings are the most sought-after achievement in the world of search engine optimization (SEO). Small businesses and brands alike strive to obtain the first organic listing in search results because of the lucrative traffic and lead opportunities that are associated with this position. But with the evolution of paid advertising and expansion of universal search, as well as Google’s continuous efforts to provide consumers with content that resolves their demands directly in search results, the opportunities attached to traditional keyword rankings are diminishing at an alarming rate. In today’s search landscape, SEOs and digital marketing specialists have to consider whether it’s worth the amount of time and resources it takes to achieve premier organic rankings, considering the click-through rates (CTR) associated with organic rankings that are positioned under PLAs, local results and other forms of content. Keyword rankings aren’t the only way to connect to online customers There was a time not too long ago when achieving the first organic position on Google was one of the only ways to attract new online customers to a website without having to invest in paid advertising or e-mail marketing. Ten years ago, the world was just warming up to the power of social media and its influence on the World Wide Web. Back then, most consumers were just starting to become aware of YouTube’s marketing power, Facebook was starting to open itself up to audiences outside of college students, and blogging was just starting to become mainstream, as everyone from CNN to Mashable began investing in new, niche content in the form of top lists and how-to articles. Because of this boom in social connectivity, businesses and brands suddenly had access to free channels that were viable for attracting new business to their websites. In 2017, there are thousands of social media platforms to join, millions of user-generated content forums, and approximately 320 million blogs around the world (up from 260 million in 2015). Today, it’s rare to find a local business or brand that isn’t connected to an established directory host like Yelp or TripAdvisor, whose own online credibility is so impressive that it allows their less authoritative clients to rank well within organic results. New niche environments allow businesses to focus on conversions, not site traffic When companies and brands were only able to connect with new customers through organic rankings, it made sense to invest a significant amount of time and resources to build thousands of links and cram keywords into a particular website to increase visibility. Now that there are thousands of free channels that cater to niche demographics with specific interests, it’s easier than ever for brands to identify relevant environments that can be targeted for conversions. The online landscape of today allows businesses and brands to focus on maximizing qualified conversions, rather than trying to gain as much traffic as possible with the hopes that a particular portion is going to convert into a sale. One of the problems with keyword rankings is that any consumer can click through to a website and immediately leave because the title tag and meta description didn’t align with the content of its associated landing page. Ranking first on Google does not mean that every visitor is going to turn into a paying customer because of how limited keywords are for understanding granular details associated with online consumers. Social media and other niche online communities trump the value of keyword rankings because they serve as natural environments for like-minded users with specific interests to hang out in, consuming new forms of hyper-focused content that keep them returning. Because of how easy it is today for businesses to build strong social media followings, basic engagement can improve everything from brand awareness and online reputation to traffic and revenue. Keyword rankings lack the power of social media because they are not proactive means of engagement, and they don’t necessarily connect brands with the type of qualified traffic that exists and is readily available in communities like Reddit or Instagram. Google is crushing the desire to achieve premier keyword rankings It’s always important to keep in mind that Google is a business; they are not just a convenient means for finding information or purchasing products. Recognizing that Google is a business that competes in a free market where consumers have options, it is their goal to become an all-inclusive destination that provides an experience that is so fulfilling, it keeps consumers returning to their search engine. Local results bury traditional rankings Google’s focus on providing content that displays local options for consumers to consider has diminished the power of premier keyword rankings for some industries which were appearing at the very top of search listings, only to now be buried beneath the fold. Sponsored ads blend with organic results Product listing ads and the inclusion of a fourth paid search ad for certain highly commercial queries have pushed organic results down the page even further, which significantly reduces the CTR of each organic position. Considering that the first organic position on Google commanded a 31 percent CTR in 2014 and the fourth position garnered a 7 percent CTR, it’s clear that today’s blended search results pages may render top organic results that are not nearly as powerful for driving site traffic as they used to be. Free products, direct answers & featured snippets diminish consumers’ need to engage in site content The ability for Google to resolve consumer demands without having to enter a particular website continues to increase, as there are more free products, definitions and featured snippets appearing every day. Informational websites that depend on attracting a tremendous amount of traffic in order to maintain their ad rates are at the mercy of featured snippets, which provide users with immediate answers whenever they search with specific questions. Featured snippets also push traditional rankings below the fold, which may negatively affect CTR. Why keyword rankings are still important for success Although all of the points made against the effort it takes to build premier keyword rankings are valid, it is still important for businesses and brands to actively strive for premier organic rankings. Despite diminished visibility and CTR within particular types of search listings, organic rankings remain one of the most powerful entrances for brands to connect with new customers. SEOs and digital marketing specialists can maximize their traffic and conversion opportunities through keyword rankings by creating quality content around niche concepts and phrases that their target audience uses or searches for. This allows brands to increase their monthly traffic and receive qualified conversions based on the type of consumer research that guides their content development efforts. Like anything else with digital marketing, the formula for achieving success is to maintain a campaign that combines social media, paid advertising, SEO and other relevant channels.
