The team takes a look at why manufacturers and other consumer goods companies bring about the product creep they later seek to control. Motley Fool Staff (the_motley_fool) Oct 26, 2016 at 3:11PM As companies adopt "SKU rationalization", the end result is often a decrease in the number of stock keeping units, or SKUs, a manufacturer offers. In the accompanying Industry Focus: Consumer Goods segment, Motley Fool analyst Vincent Shen is joined by senior Fool.com contributor Asit Sharma to discuss the three major factors that can drive a company to develop bloat in its products line in the first place. A full transcript follows the video. This podcast was recorded on Oct. 12, 2016. Vincent Shen: Our next supertrend has companies turning their attention, I think, a bit more into their internal operations. That's with SKU rationalization or specifically for our discussion, SKU reduction. So we'll look at this through the lens of two leading consumer products companies: Unilever and Procter & Gamble. But before we get any further than that I mentioned SKU rationalization and I think some of our listeners could probably use just a quick update or refresher on exactly what we're talking about there. Asit Sharma: Absolutely. What is an SKU? It's shorthand for "stock keeping unit" and Wikipedia has a great definition. I'm going to read this for our listeners. It's a "distinct type of item for sale." So manufacturers identify their products by unique codes that they've built. Those may actually be different than the barcodes that you see in, let's say, a grocery store when you're picking up a package to scan and pay for, but each product a manufacturer builds has this code and every time they vary the product whether it's size, color, anything, that creates a new stock keeping unit, or SKU. Shen: So, I think that with the SKUs and it kind of comes into conflict a little bit. On the one hand, we're going to talk about in this discussion how companies are working to basically make their operations more efficient, more profitable, and in some cases they are able to even boost their sales by reducing some of the offerings that they give to consumers. But in the last episode, we talked about on the customization side, giving more optionality, more potential to personalize and customize a product for each consumer, but I guess my question is can you give us an idea of how things flow through a company? We can use maybe one of the two companies, Unilever, or Procter & Gamble as an example, but how this decision in terms of what products are offered, the number of SKUs in a company's portfolio kind of flow through and can impact some of the metrics that investors are focused on generally. Sharma: It's a good question. Companies play a guessing game when they create products for a particular brand portfolio. And that guessing game is: What will the consumer want? What's the consumer's tolerance for product variation? And there are three major factors that drive the expansion of a product portfolio. First is to keep those product lines fresh and relevant. Most of us have seen the phrase "new and improved," and I guess listeners are familiar with the concept that this is all in a marketing ploy, but companies also create more products to suit the changing whims of the customer. I have these whims, and you have these whims, we may not know it, a lot of times these are internalized and it's based on what we imbibe from our culture, popular culture. Just also what's practical in our lives. Could be a very small variation on, let's say a handle of a grocery jug. We've seen milk cartons change over time. So, these whims drive product innovation as well. The third thing is product innovation. Now, when I think of product innovation, I think of a brand-new product. Because, well, innovate; you must be creating something new. But corporations look at slight variations in product packaging or say they change a formulation, add a flavor to a juice. If you are a beverage manufacturer that is a third reason. And innovation to a manufacturer can be very slight tweak. So these three factors drive that expansion of a portfolio and what we see is that in the consumer marketplace, companies will first expand their portfolios and then start to draw them back because it's an art, it's not a science. If a company had a handle on exactly how many variations of a product per each geographical region was necessary, then they would find this miraculous optimization of profit. And that's just not something that comes easily. Asit Sharma has no position in any stocks mentioned. Vincent Shen has no position in any stocks mentioned.

The firm maintained its Buy rating and $98 target price, implying upside of more than 12 percent. The company delivered core EPS that topped estimates by $0.05 while revenue came in line with the consensus. However, the key factor is that organic sales advanced 3 percent compared to the Street expectations of 2.4 percent. The brokerage listed the following five key takeaways from the conference call: Expects return to market growth in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017 citing the current 3–3.5 percent market growth pace. Sees quarterly growth to be lumpy with Q2 and Q3 expected to be below Q1. Emerging markets grow 6 percent, with 4 percent and 2 percent coming from volume and price mix respectively. Developed markets delivered 2 percent growth. FabriCare grew 7 percent in North America in the first quarter. However, the company's selective portfolio management dragged down in emerging markets. Trends in China are showing improvements. In a note, Analyst Kevin Grundy said, "Macros remain volatile and investment in FY17 will constrain EPS growth, though we continue to like the set-up here with room for P&G to re-rate as org sales growth returns to industry growth rates. Maintain $98 PT and FY17-19 EPS ests., though see conservatism in P&G's guide."

Jeanne Yurman reports. Video Transcript Strong demand for baby, feminine, and home care products plus solid cost cutting helped Procter & Gamble end the quarter with a profit that surpassed Wall Street expectations. The world's second largest consumer products company has been selling off money losing brands and focusing on core brands such as Tide, Pampers and Gillette to jump-start sluggish sales. Erin Lash, analyst at Morningstar. (SOUNDBITE) ERIN LASH, CFA, SENIOR EQUITY ANALYST, CONSUMER PACKAGED GOODS, MORNINGSTAR, (ENGLISH) SAYING: "Not only we think that that will fuel further top line growth, but will also take complexity out of the business and enable them free up more funds to further reinvest behind their brands than what they have been able to do up to this point." P&G sold 41 of its brands, including Clairol and Wella, to Coty in a $12.5 billion deal earlier this month. It is planning to further cut costs and save as much as $10 billion over the next five years. It aims to reinvest a big chunk of those savings in new products and packaging, research and development, and growing sales. more from business   Multimedia VIDEO Xi, Obama meet at APEC in Lima AUDIO Update on the DP World Tour Championship AUDIO Will UAE issue a sovereign bond in the near future?

U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer said the nearly $15 billion deal “adequately and fairly” compensates consumers and gets the polluting vehicles off the road as soon as possible. The German automaker acknowledged last year that about 475,000 Volkswagens and Audis with 2-litre, four-cylinder diesel engines were programmed to cheat on emissions tests. ___ Despite warnings, extremely dangerous air bags not repaired DETROIT (AP) — Despite thousands of mailed notices and warnings of grave danger, Honda is still having trouble finding and notifying about 300,000 people with potentially deadly air bag inflators in their cars. About 69 million Takata inflators have been recalled due to possible rupture. And in June, government regulators said testing showed that inflators in 313,000 older Hondas and Acuras had as high as a 50 per cent chance of rupturing in a crash. They told owners to stop driving them and get repairs. But four months later, only 13,000 of the cars have done so, highlighting major holes remain in the recall system. ___ New Wells Fargo CEO to employees: ‘We’re sorry’ NEW YORK (AP) — Newly appointed Wells Fargo CEO Tim Sloan has told employees that he is “sorry for the pain” that the bank’s employees have felt as a result of the company’s sales practices scandal. Sloan’s company-wide speech given Tuesday is the latest effort by Wells Fargo’s executives to atone for the fact that the bank’s employees, pushed by impossible sales goals, opened as many as 2 million bank and credit card accounts without customers’ authorization. In the speech, Sloan acknowledged that the bank did not respond to the problems in its branches soon enough and that upper management dodged responsibility for the bad behaviour and wrongly placed blamed on its branch employees. ___ Consumer stocks fall as Whirlpool, GM and others skid NEW YORK (AP) — Shaky results from consumer companies dragged the U.S. stock market lower on Tuesday as well-known names like appliance maker Whirlpool and athletic apparel maker Under Armour suffered their worst losses in years. Third-quarter earnings continued to dominate the market and some of the biggest companies either reported disappointing results or lowered their expectations. Investors wondered if consumers will spend less money on home improvement, clothing and other goods. But companies including Procter & Gamble and Lockheed Martin soared after their reports. Looking for safer options, some investors bought bonds and utility company shares. ___ US home prices rose in August, lifted by dwindling supply WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. home prices climbed at a solid pace in August as more home buyers competed for fewer available properties. The Standard & Poor’s CoreLogic Case-Shiller 20-city home price index rose 5.1 per cent in August, after a 5 per cent gain in July. Portland, Seattle and Denver reported the strongest year-over-year increases for the seventh month in a row. Steady hiring, low mortgage rates and some early signs of rising pay have encouraged more Americans to buy homes. Yet the number of homes for sale has fallen nearly 7 per cent from a year ago. ___ Consumer confidence retreated slightly in October WASHINGTON (AP) — American consumers felt less confident this month, but the small retreat came after confidence had risen to a 20-month high in September. Consumer confidence slipped to 98.6 this month after rising to 103.5 in September, the Conference Board reported Tuesday. The September reading was the highest since confidence stood at 103.8 in January 2015. The September confidence number was revised down from an initial estimate of 104.1, which had been the highest in nine years. The lower October reading reflected a drop in consumers’ assessment of current business conditions and employment prospects. ___ Caterpillar stung by global economic funk PEORIA, Ill. (AP) — Caterpillar’s third-quarter profit was essentially cut in half with the global economy stuck in a funk, and the company said that it expects that malaise to extend into next year. The construction and mining equipment maker lowered its outlook for the year. Falling commodity prices on the farm, in the mines, and in the oil patch have forced a deep reduction in equipment spending. The earnings report Tuesday was the first since Caterpillar announced that longtime CEO Doug Oberhelman was stepping down. ___ Merck breezes past 3Q profit expectations, raises forecast Higher sales of vaccines and prescription medicines, coupled with restrained spending, helped Merck & Co. post a 20 per cent jump in third-quarter profit, trouncing Wall Street expectations. The company raised and narrowed its 2016 financial forecasts, but noted some headwinds, including the start of U.S. generic competition to three drugs by year’s end. ___ Procter & Gamble’s 1Q performance tops Street’s view CINCINNATI (AP) — Procter & Gamble Co.’s fiscal first-quarter results beat Wall Street’s expectations as it controlled expenses and saw solid sales growth in its health care segment. P&G has been working on transforming its business to better focus on bigger brands with growth potential. The company has already shed some of the smaller brands it says collectively contribute little to its operating profit. ___ Under Armour takes a breather BALTIMORE (AP) — Under Armour had one of the worst trading days in its history as investors sensed that the hard-charging athletic company may be hitting the wall. The company reported Tuesday that quarterly revenue growth was the slowest in six years and it trimmed growth projections. Chief Financial Officer Chip Molloy said that while Under Armour continues to believe that it will significantly outpace rivals, “the growth rate going forward will be less than” what was anticipated last year. ___ GM reports record 3Q earnings despite slowing US sales DETROIT (AP) — General Motors doesn’t seem too worried about slowing U.S. auto sales or economic troubles in Europe. If third-quarter numbers are any indication, the company has numbers to back that up. The Detroit automaker reported a record profit on Tuesday that doubled results in the third quarter a year ago. And the automaker put a little more swagger behind its full-year guidance, predicting pretax earnings at the high end of previous forecasts of $5.50 to $6 per share. GM earned $2.77 billion, or $1.76 per share, compared with $1.36 billion, or 84 cents per share a year ago. Revenue hit a record $42.8 billion. ___ Chipotles sales fall again as it tries to win back customers NEW YORK (AP) — Chipotle says its sales fell for the fifth straight quarter, as the company struggles to win back customers after an E. coli scare last year. The burrito chain says sales fell 21.9 per cent at established restaurants during the quarter ending Sept. 30. That’s worse than the 18.3 per cent drop Wall Street analysts expected, according to FactSet. The company has given out millions of free burritos and launched a three-month loyalty program in June to try to bring customers back. In September, it offered even more freebies: Kids could eat free on Sundays and students could grab free sodas or iced tea with their meals. ___ The Dow Jones industrial average sank 53.76 points, or 0.3 per cent, to 18,169.27. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index gave up 8.17 points, or 0.4 per cent, to 2,143.16. The Nasdaq composite slid 26.43 points, or 0.5 per cent, to 5,283.40. Benchmark U.S. crude lost 56 cents, or 1.1 per cent, to $49.96 per barrel in New York. Brent crude, the international standard, fell 67 cents, or 1.3 per cent, to $50.79 a barrel in London. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline stayed at $1.50 a gallon. Heating oil lost 2 cent to $1.56 a gallon. Natural gas sank 6 cent, or 2 per cent, to $2.77 per 1,000 cubic feet. shares Share: Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Google+ Share Email Advertisement Advertisement    Leave a comment Hide comments Leave a comment Cancel reply Sign in to comment.

Oct 25, 2016, 3:47 pm EST  |  By , ETFChannel.com     A study of analyst recommendations at the major brokerages shows that Procter & Gamble Co (PG) is the #11 broker pick, on average, out of the 30 stocks making up the Dow Jones Industrial Average, according to ETF Channel. Procter & Gamble also comes in above the median of analyst picks among the broader S&P 500 Index components, claiming the #212 spot out of 500. In forming this rank, the analyst opinions from the major brokerage houses were tallied, and averaged; then, the underlying components were ranked according to those averages. Investors often interpret analyst opinions from different angles — a popular analyst pick could mean that many sharp minds individually came to the same bullish conclusion, and therefore the stock should do well, but it could also mean that if the company stumbles, that would come as a negative surprise.

"We will absolutely accept the results of the election," Trump's vice presidential candidate, Mike Pence said on the Sunday shows. Trump's remarks reflect his frustration with "the obvious bias in the national media" reporting in the last month of the election allegations that Trump sexually assaulted several women. Trump says all of the allegations are "lies." "When he talks about a rigged election, he's not talking about the fact that it's going to be rigged at the polls," former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani said. "What he's talking about is that 80 percent to 85 percent of the media is against him." In fact, Trump did warn, without evidence, about vote fraud in a tweet sent after his surrogates tried to reframe his remarks. "The election is absolutely being rigged by the dishonest and distorted media pushing Crooked Hillary - but also at many polling places - SAD," Trump tweeted later Sunday. Much of the cleanup duty falls to Pence, the Indiana governor trying to support the mercurial Trump without damaging his own future presidential prospects. On Sunday, that meant putting distance between himself and Trump over the very legitimacy of the Nov. 8 election after Trump on Saturday revived the claim that the FBI should have brought charges against Hillary Clinton over her use of a homebrew email server. "Hillary Clinton should have been prosecuted and should be in jail. Instead she is running for president in what looks like a rigged election," Trump tweeted to his 12 million followers on Saturday. Answered Pence Sunday: "We'll accept the will of the American people. You bet." Threatening to jail a political opponent and fueling public distrust of a popular election — to explain his loss, should that happen — was a striking breach of faith in American democracy. He has repeatedly claimed, without offering evidence, that election fraud is a serious problem and encouraged his mostly white supporters to "go and watch" polling places in certain areas to make sure things are "on the up and up." Trump is struggling to shift the focus away from mounting accusations that he sexually assaulted women in ways similar to behavior he is recorded describing on a recently released video. That puts Pence in the position of putting air between himself and the man at the top of the ticket. Trump, for example, has fought back against the allegations of sexual abuse by saying some of the accusers aren't attractive enough for him to assault, and by calling all of the charges "lies." But Pence on Sunday declined to make any such attacks. "I wouldn't say anything to disparage any woman who believes they've had an experience like this," he said on NBC, adding that he believes Trump's denials. On another subject, Pence was asked if he agrees with Trump's statement Saturday that Clinton was on drugs during the second debate and calling for drug testing before Wednesday's third and final showdown. "All I know for sure is that Donald Trump is going to be ready for the debate on Wednesday night," Pence replied. And unlike Trump, Pence acknowledged Sunday that evidence points to Russia being behind the hacking of Democratic emails. "I think there's more and more evidence that implicates Russia and there should be serious consequences," he said. Pence appeared on NBC's "Meet the Press" and "Fox News Sunday." Giuliani was on CNN's "State of the Union." ___ Associated Press writer Jill Colvin contributed to this report. ←Older Newer→ Updated : 2016-11-21 02:15 GMT+08:00 MOST POPULAR Costco expels member for returning 86% of purchases Canadian man savagely beats Taiwanese girlfriend on Taipei street Does China’s inherent territory include Taiwan?

Third-quarter earnings continued to dominate the market and some of the biggest companies either reported disappointing results or lowered their expectations. Investors wondered if consumers will spend less money on home improvement, clothing and other goods. But companies including Procter & Gamble and Lockheed Martin soared after their reports. Looking for safer options, some investors bought bonds and utility company shares. Consumer spending is critical to the U.S. economy and poor results for consumer-focused companies could be a sign of trouble. But Doug Roman, managing director of equities for PNC Capital Advisors, said it's too soon to know if shoppers are closing their wallets. "The market might be extrapolating bigger stories into broader themes, which might not be the case," he said. Corporate earnings have been falling for more than a year, and despite Tuesday's results, investors are growing hopeful that streak is ending. The Dow Jones industrial average shed 53.76 points, or 0.3 percent, to 18,169.27. The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 8.17 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,143.16. The Nasdaq composite fell 26.43 points, or 0.5 percent, to 5,283.40. Paint and coatings maker Sherwin-Williams posted a disappointing profit and cut its annual guidance because of slower sales growth combined with spending on new stores. Meanwhile appliance maker Whirlpool's results fell far short of analyst projections. Sherwin-Williams had its worst day in seven years as it lost $30.27, or 10.9 percent, to $247.61. Whirlpool, which owns Maytag and KitchenAid, sank $18.37, or 10.8 percent, to $152.09, its largest loss in five years. Home improvement retailers Home Depot and Lowe's and flooring maker Mohawk Industries all slumped. So did automaker General Motors, which reported solid earnings. Under Armour reported its slowest sales growth in six years and said its future sales won't be as strong as it expected a year ago. Its stock tumbled $5.01, or 13.2 percent, to $32.89, its biggest drop in almost eight years. Rival Nike also slipped. Procter & Gamble, which makes Tide detergent and Charmin toilet paper, had its best day in more than a year after it reported better results than investors expected. The consumer products giant has been selling some businesses to cut costs, and it posted stronger sales of personal care products like toothbrushes and deodorants. Its stock rose $2.87, or 3.4 percent, to $86.97. Aerospace and defense company Lockheed Martin surpassed investor forecasts and raised its projections for the year. Its stock gained $17.10, or 7.4 percent, to $249.26, its biggest leap in seven years. The reports continued to stream in after the market closed. Apple reported lower quarterly sales and sold fewer iPhones, sending its stock down about 2 percent in late trading. The company did give a better-than-expected forecast for the holiday season. Oil and gas drilling services company Baker Hughes disclosed a smaller loss than investors expected. Investors were also pleased that Baker Hughes is preparing to cut more costs. The company said it plans to eliminate $650 million in spending this year, up from the $500 million it had planned to cut. It climbed $2.24, or 4.3 percent, to $54.39. Waters Corp. of Milford, Massachusetts, which makes products used in drug development, announced weak revenue as demand from governments, research institutions and industries fell. The stock slid $19.15, or 12.1 percent, to $138.60. Drug maker Merck raised its forecasts after it reported a bigger profit on greater sales of vaccines and cancer medicines.

However strong results for household goods maker Procter & Gamble are sending its stock higher. KEEPING SCORE: The Dow Jones industrial average shed 47 points, or 0.3 percent, to 18,176 as of 10:45 a.m. Mountain time. The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 8 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,143. The Nasdaq composite fell 28 points, or 0.5 percent, to 5,282. BAD FIT: Under Armour reported its slowest sales growth in six years and said its future sales won't be as strong as it expected a year ago. Its stock tumbled $5.09, or 13.4 percent, to $32.81. Under Armour traded above $50 a share a little more than a year ago. VIDEOS TOP JOBS PAINT IT BLACK: Paint and coatings maker Sherwin-Williams posted a profit that was smaller than expected. The company cut its annual guidance because of slower sales growth combined with spending on new stores. Its stock lost $27.88, or 10 percent, to $250. FOCUS: Procter & Gamble, the company that makes Tide detergent and Charmin toilet paper, reported better results than investors expected. The consumer products giant has been selling some businesses to cut costs, and it posted stronger sales of personal care products like toothbrushes and deodorants. Its stock rose $3.28, or 3.9 percent, to $87.38. ALL WET: Appliance maker Whirlpool's results fell far short of analyst projections. The maker of Maytag and KitchenAid products sank $19.22, or 11.3 percent, to $151.24. A GUSHER: Oil and gas drilling services company Baker Hughes disclosed a smaller loss than investors expected. Investors were also pleased that Baker Hughes is preparing to cut more costs. The company said it plans to eliminate $650 million in spending this year, up from the $500 million it had planned to cut. It climbed $2.40, or 4.6 percent, to $54.55.

The stock slid $18.09, or 11.5 percent, to $139.66. AIMING HIGH: Aerospace and defense company Lockheed Martin surpassed investor forecasts and raised its projections for the year. Its stock gained $15.03, or 6.5 percent, to $247.19. TAP THE BRAKES: General Motors had a strong quarter but investors sent its stock down $1.34, or 4.1 percent, to $31.64. U.S. auto sales have risen to record highs and recently they've showed some signs of slowing down, which has left investors worried about GM's growth. MERCK MAKES MORE: Drugmaker Merck raised its forecasts after it reported a bigger profit on greater sales of vaccines and cancer medicines. The company has also been trying to keep is spending in check. The stock rose 95 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $61.70. 3M GETS STUCK: 3M, which makes Post-it notes, industrial coatings and ceramics, forecast weaker sales growth and a smaller profit for the year. The stock declined 5.34, or 3.1 percent, to $165.94. GOING UP: Elevator and jet engine manufacturer United Technologies raised its annual forecast after its third-quarter profit surpassed analyst estimates. Its stock gained $2.11, or 2.1 percent, to $101.63.

CONSUMER CONFIDENCE: American consumers felt less confident this month, according to the Conference Board. Consumer confidence was lower than expected. The measurement rose to a 20-month high in September. OIL: Benchmark U.S. crude lost 59 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $49.93 per barrel in New York. Brent crude, the international standard, fell 66 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $50.80 a barrel in London. However energy companies held steady thanks to big gains for Baker Hughes and to oil refiner Valero, which reported strong results and jumped $2.47, or 4.4 percent, to $58.63. BONDS: Bond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 1.75 percent from 1.77 percent. CURRENCIES: The dollar slipped to 104.20 yen from 104.24 yen. The euro fell to $1.0885 from $1.0879. OVERSEAS: In Britain the FTSE 100 rose 0.4 percent while France's CAC 40 lost 0.3 percent and the DAX in Germany was little changed. Japan's Nikkei 225 rose 0.8 percent and South Korea's Kospi fell 0.5 percent.

Weaker oil prices also cast a pall. KEEPING SCORE: Japan's Nikkei 225 wavered into a modest gain by midday, adding 0.1 percent to 17,379.25, but most other regional benchmarks fell. Hong Kong's Hang Seng dropped 0.7 percent to 23,403.44 and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 dropped 1.5 percent to 5,359.40. South Korea's Kospi lost 1.5 percent to 2,007.38 and India's Sensex lost 0.7 percent to 27,895.12. Markets in Southeast Asia and Taiwan also fell. WALL STREET BLUES: Disappointing third-quarter earnings from big name companies raised worries over consumer spending, a critical driver of U.S. growth. Sherwin-Williams had its worst day in seven years, losing 10.9 percent, while Whirlpool plunged 10.8 percent. Athletic wear maker Under Armour's shares sank 13.2 percent, its biggest drop in almost eight years. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.3 percent to 18,169.27, the Standard & Poor's 500 index gave up 0.4 percent to 2,143.16 and the Nasdaq composite shed 0.5 percent, to 5,283.40.

Stocks opened slightly lower on Wall Street, Tuesday, Oct. 25, 2016, as some companies issue disappointing earnings and forecasts. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) ANALYST VIEWPOINT: "U.S. equities turned lower overnight as the U.S. Consumer Confidence Index printed well below market expectations," Illka Gobius of OANDA said in a commentary. "We could see further pressure on equity markets because oil prices plunged in late N.Y. trade" after the American Petroleum Institute reported a much larger than expected buildup in U.S. crude inventories. APPLE EARNINGS: After U.S. markets closed, Apple reported lower quarterly sales, another dispiriting factor given the many Asian manufacturers that are suppliers for the iPhone and other Apple products. "Apple's numbers after-market look quite uninspiring and we are seeing shares down 2.5 percent in after-hours trade," Chris Weston of IG said in a research note. OIL PRICES: Benchmark U.S. crude fell 65 cents to $49.31 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It lost 56 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $49.96 per barrel on Tuesday. Brent crude, the international standard, dropped 58 cents to $50.21 a barrel. It fell 67 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $50.79 a barrel in London. CURRENCIES: The dollar rose to 104.35 yen from 104.12 yen. The euro rose to $1.0890 from $1.0879. ___ AP Markets Writer Marley Jay contributed to this report.

Shares of the maker of Tide detergent and Charmin toilet paper gained more than 4 percent in afternoon trading Tuesday. P&G has been working on transforming its business to better focus on bigger brands with growth potential. The company has already shed some of the smaller brands it says collectively contribute little to its operating profit. Chairman, President and CEO David Taylor said in a written statement Tuesday that the company is “now focusing all our efforts on 10 large, structurally attractive categories where P&G holds leading positions.” Advertisement Continue reading P&G, the world’s largest consumer products maker, earned $2.71 billion, or 96 cents per share, for the period ended Sept. 30. A year ago the Cincinnati-based company earned $2.6 billion, or 91 cents per share. Earnings, adjusted to account for discontinued operations and restructuring costs, were $1.03 per share. That topped the 98 cents per share that analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research expected. Revenue was basically flat at $16.52 billion. Analysts polled by Zacks expected revenue of $16.45 billion. Sales for the health care unit climbed 4 percent, while sales for the fabric and home care division edged up 1 percent. For fiscal 2017, P&G still expects adjusted earnings per share growth of mid-single digits compared with fiscal 2016’s earnings of $3.67 per share. Analysts polled by FactSet predict earnings of $3.88 per share. Its shares rose $3.48, or 4.1 percent, to $87.58 in afternoon trading Tuesday.

  Home U.K. News Sports U.S. Showbiz Australia Femail Health Science Money Video Travel Columnists Wires Home My Profile Logout Login Feedback DailyMail NEW ARTICLESHomeTop Share show ad P&G profit beats on cost cuts, demand for home care goods By Reuters Published: 11:21 EST, 25 October 2016 | Updated: 11:21 EST, 25 October 2016 e-mail By Sruthi Ramakrishnan Oct 25 (Reuters) - Procter & Gamble Co, the maker of Tide detergent and Pampers diapers, reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit, helped by cost-cutting and strong demand for its baby, feminine and home care products. P&G's shares were up 4.6 percent at $87.97 on Tuesday morning. The company has been selling off unprofitable brands and focusing on core brands such as Tide, Pampers and Gillette to revive sluggish sales. P&G sold 41 of its brands, including Clairol and Wella, to Coty Inc in a $12.5 billion deal earlier this month. P&G is also planning to save as much as $10 billion in costs over the next five years, after cutting the same amount in costs over the last five years. The company plans to reinvest a significant portion of savings from the new plan in product and packaging improvement, research and development, and expanding sales coverage, P&G's Chief Financial Officer Jon Moeller said on a media call. Organic sales in P&G's fabric and home care business - its largest - rose 4 percent in the first quarter, while those in baby, feminine and family care, the second largest, rose 2 percent. The two businesses, which house brands such as Tide, Febreze, Pampers and Tampex, together accounted for 60 percent of the company's total revenue. P&G's revenue was driven by "solid" volume growth of 3 percent in the quarter, in contrast to rivals such as Unilever , whose sales were mainly propped up by price hikes, Jefferies analyst Kevin Grundy wrote in a note. Net sales remained largely flat at $16.52 billion in the quarter ended Sept. 30, but beat the average estimate of $16.49 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales in the United Kingdom, P&G's largest European market, fell 2 percent in the quarter, Moeller said. Britain's vote to leave the European Union has caused a plunge in the pound, leading consumer goods makers such as Unilever to attempt to raise prices in the market. Moeller declined to discuss P&G's pricing strategy, but said the UK continued to be a "very challenging and highly promotional" market. P&G said net income attributable to the company rose 4.3 percent to $2.71 billion, or 96 cents per share. Excluding items, P&G earned $1.03 per share from continuing operations, beating the average analyst estimate of 98 cents. P&G's quarterly sales have been mostly falling for more than three years, as the company has been cutting its brand portfolio.

Improved business efforts include streamlining the company's cost structure, material pruning of portfolio, a new CEO, modest organizational realignment and overhaul of incentive compensation down to market activation level. Q3 Review, Improvement May Be Unsustainable Analyst Jason English noted that the company reported better than expected Q1 EPS on better organic sales growth and also reiterated its full year guidance. However, English is of the view that this is unlikely to be a sustained turn, given the historical pattern of unsustained improvement and the easier comparisons for the quarter. Although believing that real improvement is afoot, the firm feels it would translate into a middle-of-the-pack algorithm of low-single-digit sales and mid-to-high EPS growth beyond. Given the company's relative premium to other global mega-cap staples companies, the firm thinks the company needs to deliver more to drive relative outperformance. The firm has a Neutral view on shares, but raised its price target to $92 from $90.

Demitrios Kalogeropoulos (TMFSigma) Oct 25, 2016 at 7:46PM Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) is on a roll. The consumer goods giant this week posted its fastest pace of quarterly sales growth in nearly three years. And, despite a sluggish overall industry, P&G managed to boost market share while producing solid earnings gains as well. Here's how the big-picture results stacked up against the prior-year period:  Metric Q3 2016 Actuals Q3 2015 Actuals Growth (YOY) Revenue $16.5 billion $16.5 billion N/A Net income $2.76 billion $2.64 billion 5% Earnings per share $0.96 $0.93 6% Data source: P&G financial filings. YOY = year over year. Sales growth is up Reported revenue was flat, but organic growth, which strips out the impact of currency changes and brand divestments, rose at a healthy 3% clip. That marked P&G's best showing since the first quarter of 2014. Image source: Getty Images. The company can also claim some solid momentum on this key metric: Organic growth was flat nine months ago before stepping up to a 1% quarterly pace, followed by a 2% pace last quarter. P&G is even outpacing rivals, for a change. Unilever (NYSE:UL) recently announced a sales growth slowdown as organic gains fell to a 3% rate from the 5% clip the company had enjoyed for over a year. Unilever endured a rare sales volume dip, too. Procter & Gamble, in contrast, enjoyed its second straight quarter of volume-driven growth as the metric rose in each of its five main product categories, led by a 5% jump in the healthcare segment. Costs are down Costs continued to trend lower, thanks to management's multiyear effort to slice billions of dollars out of its expense structure. Cost of goods sold fell as a percentage of sales, which kept the company right on track to deliver its target of $2 billion of annual savings. PG Cost of Goods Sold (TTM) data by YCharts. Cutting against those gains was an uptick in advertising spending. Management has credited the increased marketing support for helping drive sales gains, and so the company is likely to continue trading higher organic growth for lower operating profits. Still, the bottom line improved despite the flat revenue and higher advertising spend. P&G's net profit margin ticked up by nearly a full percentage point, to 16.4% of sales, despite the negative impact of currency swings. Over $1 billion of stock repurchases, meanwhile, helped power a 6% jump in per-share earnings. Management's focus Executives sounded pleased with P&G's performance. "Our first quarter results mark a good start to the fiscal year," CEO David Taylor said in a press release. "We delivered broad-based organic sales growth improvement across product categories and markets, as well as strong cost savings." P&G's 10 core product categories. Image source: P&G investor presentation. Management also highlighted its recent sale of beauty brands to Coty that marked the effective end of its two-year brand-shedding initiative. Now the company is targeting just 66 franchises (down from 165) that Taylor and his team believe have the best prospects for sales growth and profitability. "We are now focusing all our efforts on 10 large, structurally attractive categories where P&G holds leading positions," executives said. Looking ahead P&G still has plenty of work ahead before investors can call the turnaround a success, though. After all, the company left its full-year sales growth outlook unchanged at 2%, which implies that executives see a slowdown ahead over the next nine months. However, this report provides the strongest evidence yet that P&G's growth trend is finally starting to improve. The company has now logged two straight quarters of sales volume gains, and market-share gains are evident in categories like healthcare, and fabric and home care. So it seems likely that P&G will soon return to the level of balanced growth that management has aimed for, but not achieved, in years.

Third-quarter earnings continued to dominate the market and some of the biggest companies either reported disappointing results or lowered their expectations. Investors wondered if consumers will spend less money on home improvement, clothing and other goods. But companies including Procter & Gamble and Lockheed Martin soared after their reports. Looking for safer options, some investors bought bonds and utility company shares. Consumer spending is critical to the U.S. economy and poor results for consumer-focused companies could be a sign of trouble. But Doug Roman, managing director of equities for PNC Capital Advisors, said it’s too soon to know if shoppers are closing their wallets. “The market might be extrapolating bigger stories into broader themes, which might not be the case,” he said. Corporate earnings have been falling for more than a year, and despite Tuesday’s results, investors are growing hopeful that streak is ending. The Dow Jones industrial average shed 53.76 points, or 0.3 percent, to 18,169.27. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index lost 8.17 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,143.16. The Nasdaq composite fell 26.43 points, or 0.5 percent, to 5,283.40. Paint and coatings maker Sherwin-Williams posted a disappointing profit and cut its annual guidance because of slower sales growth combined with spending on new stores. Meanwhile appliance maker Whirlpool’s results fell far short of analyst projections. Sherwin-Williams had its worst day in seven years as it lost $30.27, or 10.9 percent, to $247.61. Whirlpool, which owns Maytag and KitchenAid, sank $18.37, or 10.8 percent, to $152.09, its largest loss in five years. Home improvement retailers Home Depot and Lowe’s and flooring maker Mohawk Industries all slumped. So did automaker General Motors, which reported solid earnings. Under Armour reported its slowest sales growth in six years and said its future sales won’t be as strong as it expected a year ago. Its stock tumbled $5.01, or 13.2 percent, to $32.89, its biggest drop in almost eight years. Rival Nike also slipped. Meanwhile a report showed that consumer confidence fell in October as consumers got a bit more pessimistic about business conditions and their employment prospects. The Conference Board had said consumer confidence reached a 20-month high in September. Procter & Gamble, which makes Tide detergent and Charmin toilet paper, had its best day in more than a year after it reported better results than investors expected. The consumer products giant has been selling some businesses to cut costs, and it posted stronger sales of personal care products like toothbrushes and deodorants. Its stock rose $2.87, or 3.4 percent, to $86.97, Aerospace and defense company Lockheed Martin surpassed investor forecasts and raised its projections for the year. Its stock gained $17.10, or 7.4 percent, to $249.26, its biggest leap in seven years. The reports continued to stream in after the market closed. Apple reported lower quarterly sales and sold fewer iPhones, sending its stock down about 2 percent in late trading. The company did give a better-than-expected forecast for the holiday season. Oil and gas drilling services company Baker Hughes disclosed a smaller loss than investors expected. Investors were also pleased that Baker Hughes is preparing to cut more costs. The company said it plans to eliminate $650 million in spending this year, up from the $500 million it had planned to cut. It climbed $2.24, or 4.3 percent, to $54.39. Waters Corp., which makes products used in drug development, announced weak revenue as demand from governments, research institutions and industries fell. The stock slid $19.15, or 12.1 percent, to $138.60. Drugmaker Merck raised its forecasts after it reported a bigger profit on greater sales of vaccines and cancer medicines. The company has also been trying to keep is spending in check. The stock rose $1.20, or 2 percent, to $61.95. 3M, which makes Post-it notes, industrial coatings and ceramics, forecast weaker sales growth and a smaller profit for the year. The stock declined $5.04, or 2.9 percent, to $166.23. Elevator and jet engine manufacturer United Technologies raised its annual forecast after its third-quarter profit surpassed analyst estimates. Its stock gained $1.84, or 1.8 percent, to $101.36. Media and marketing information company Nielsen took its biggest loss ever after it reported shaky results and cut its guidance. Nielsen stock tumbled $9.28, or 16.9 percent, to $45.65. Benchmark U.S. crude lost 56 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $49.96 per barrel in New York. Brent crude, the international standard, fell 67 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $50.79 a barrel in London. Bond prices edged higher. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 1.76 percent from 1.77 percent. Investors also bought shares of utility companies. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline stayed at $1.50 a gallon. Heating oil lost 2 cent to $1.56 a gallon. Natural gas sank 6 cent, or 2 percent, to $2.77 per 1,000 cubic feet. The price of gold rose $9.90 to $1,273.60 an ounce. Silver jumped 18 cents, or 1 percent, to $17.78 an ounce. Copper rose 5 cents, or 2.2 percent, to $2.14 a pound. The dollar slipped to 104.22 yen from 104.24 yen. The euro rose to $1.0892 from $1.0879. In Britain the FTSE 100 rose 0.4 percent while France’s CAC 40 lost 0.3 percent and the DAX in Germany was little changed. Japan’s Nikkei 225 rose 0.8 percent and South Korea’s Kospi fell 0.5 percent. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong slipped 0.2 percent. ——— AP Markets Writer Marley Jay can be reached at http://twitter.com/MarleyJayAP His work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/journalist/marley-jay     Tags: percent, stock, results, company, reported, investors, Other stories from today: Consumer stocks fall as Whirlpool, GM and others skid Anger flares after judge OKs Volkswagen emissions deal Apple’s quarterly sales fall, forecast calls for gains     Print this Page  |  << Back   Return To Archives            Daily Journal Quick Poll   If you are traveling for Thanksgiving, when is the best time to go?

You worked with Procter & Gamble for 17 years before joining Merck in 2013. Why the transition? I never worked in healthcare before I joined Merck. It is very important to be able to relate to the category and its purpose. The contribution [Merck] gives to real people in their day-to-day lives showed me a different perspective than working on something like hair color.  How has marketing and communications changed since you joined? The first year, I wanted to see what moves consumers, doctors, and pharmacists by intentionally and significantly emotionalizing our communications. We wanted to visually soften our comms but also use terminology and ideas that speak to the heart versus speaking to the left brain, which is masculine, binary, and black and white. Around 2014, we decided to use every opportunity to position our brands as sympathy holders — the ones who care, listen, understand, and hold hands with consumers. We called them "Love Brands." At Cannes this year, Merck launched the WE100 platform. What inspired it? Love Brands was WE100's precursor. We want to prepare society for a new era where people live 100 years. Life expectancy has picked up significantly since the 1960s, even in the least developed country. But the legislative environment, government, system that is overlooking people has barely changed. You go from school to a job, the rest is smooth sailing and counting our days to the grave once you retire. What shaped the strategy? We placed a big study to find out the pain point and needs of people in this context. That shapes the content we are chewing on and about to roll out in Europe and Africa. WE100 is about the right of everybody to look forward to 100 great years and ask their governments for all the support they need. At Cannes, I was trying to find partners in crime that without any financial expectations, out of the goodness of their hearts, will help us out — such as the media industry, pharmaceutical industry, and even royalty such as [Queen Elizabeth II] and the Pope. His endorsement could be a great help for families to take this seriously for their kids. What initiatives do you have coming up around that? Healthy Hour is about raising awareness and teaching kids how to prepare for a 100-year life versus just learning about the next 20 years and how you can be good in math, physics, biology, and maybe literature so you can nail the best college and job. We are kicking that off in Africa this fall with support and engagement from governments over there. We are relying on pharmacists and doctors who in smaller villages may be the teachers of the courses. Another big project is We4You, which asks Merck employees to take time off in an organized way to help the elderly and better integrate them into society. We are doing this in Europe, working with the elderly on topics such as digital crash courses, knowledge about your bones, avoiding accidents, and restarting your professional life. What areas are you focused on? Women's and babies' health. Femibion is a pregnancy multivitamin. To support it, we came out with a campaign called Working Mothers, which is about recognizing the dedication of new moms to their babies that is perceived as holding back your career, turning it around, and recognizing your experience as a mom is a great qualification for a job as well. What can moms bring to the table? Skills moms have include listening, operational discipline, prioritizing, and multitasking, which are needed in the real world [for jobs ranging from] receptionist to the top manager. We have many female leaders. Our CEO, Uta Kemmerich-Keil, is a mother of two. The company has enabled her to go through her maternity leave, recognized her, and rewarded her to move forward. We have a lot of great stories from within our company that we will provocatively share with broader audiences in 2017. This is based in Germany and Austria, but we feel it is going to be universal. What came out of the first Global Consumer Health Debate you threw earlier this year?  The biggest realization is that 70% or more of big decisions are made by women. We had better understand their hopes, wishes, needs and contributions to the health industry. In terms of consumer health, they are the gatekeeper for the entire family. What's your biggest challenge from a marketing perspective? If doctors, pharmacists are not falling in love with what you say, they don't care or remember about the info you provide them. If your nose is decongested in 15 seconds or 12, who cares? It is a beautiful, wonderful story that can be passed onto the next person. It is worth tweeting about, and sharing on YouTube with your friends. That is what matters for doctors, pharmacists, and nurses. The challenge for the healthcare industry is how we digitize our interaction with doctors, healthcare professionals, and consumers. What agencies do you work with?  We work with Saatchi & Saatchi, SelectNY, and Ogilvy. From a PR perspective, Weber Shandwick helps us.

Third-quarter earnings continued to dominate the market and some of the biggest companies either reported disappointing results or lowered their expectations. Investors wondered if consumers will spend less money on home improvement, clothing and other goods. But companies including Procter & Gamble and Lockheed Martin soared after their reports. Looking for safer options, some investors bought bonds and utility company shares. Consumer spending is critical to the U.S. economy and poor results for consumer-focused companies could be a sign of trouble. But Doug Roman, managing director of equities for PNC Capital Advisors, said it's too soon to know if shoppers are closing their wallets. "The market might be extrapolating bigger stories into broader themes, which might not be the case," he said. Corporate earnings have been falling for more than a year, and despite Tuesday's results, investors are growing hopeful that streak is ending. The Dow Jones industrial average shed 53.76 points, or 0.3 percent, to 18,169.27. The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 8.17 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,143.16. The Nasdaq composite fell 26.43 points, or 0.5 percent, to 5,283.40. Paint and coatings maker Sherwin-Williams posted a disappointing profit and cut its annual guidance because of slower sales growth combined with spending on new stores. Meanwhile appliance maker Whirlpool's results fell far short of analyst projections. Sherwin-Williams had its worst day in seven years as it lost $30.27, or 10.9 percent, to $247.61. Whirlpool, which owns Maytag and KitchenAid, sank $18.37, or 10.8 percent, to $152.09, its largest loss in five years. Home improvement retailers Home Depot and Lowe's and flooring maker Mohawk Industries all slumped. So did automaker General Motors, which reported solid earnings. Under Armour reported its slowest sales growth in six years and said its future sales won't be as strong as it expected a year ago. Its stock tumbled $5.01, or 13.2 percent, to $32.89, its biggest drop in almost eight years. Rival Nike also slipped. Procter & Gamble, which makes Tide detergent and Charmin toilet paper, had its best day in more than a year after it reported better results than investors expected. The consumer products giant has been selling some businesses to cut costs, and it posted stronger sales of personal care products like toothbrushes and deodorants.

Demitrios Kalogeropoulos (TMFSigma) Oct 25, 2016 at 5:37PM Image source: Getty Images. Stocks ticked down on Tuesday as investors digested a flood of third-quarter earnings reports. Both the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) and the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) indexes ended the trading session lower by roughly 0.3%. Today's stock market: Index Percentage Change Point Change Dow (0.29%) (53.76) S&P 500 (0.38%) (8.17) Data source: Yahoo! Finance. The Direxion Daily Gold Miners 3X Bull ETF (NYSEMKT:NUGT) enjoyed a 9% jump as its highly leveraged bet on the precious metal benefited from an uptick in gold prices. The VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSEMKT:GDX) also enjoyed a solid uptick, rising 3% to bring its year-to-date return over 90%. Earnings reports continued to drive unusually large share price swings, including in Under Armour (NYSE:UA)(NYSE:UA-C) and Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) on Tuesday. Under Armour lowers its profit outlook Under Armour shareholders endured a 13% daily loss following the athletic apparel specialist's quarterly earnings report. Sales spiked by a healthy 22% to $1.45 billion to edge past consensus estimates that were calling for a 21% jump to $1.45 billion. Earnings also beat expectations, rising 28% to $128 million, which translated to $0.29 per share. The 33 Wall Street analysts who cover the stock were, on average, looking for $0.25 per share of profit.  Image source: Getty Images. Under Armour continues to reap huge rewards from its growing global branding. The international segment enjoyed 74% higher sales with help from significant marketing spending around the Rio Olympic Games. Footwear also expanded at a much faster pace than the rest of the company, soaring 42% to pass $250 million of sales. "Our key strategies and investments to diversify our portfolio on a global scale were evident across categories, channels, and geographies," CEO Kevin Plank said in a press release. However, those investments are costly. Under Armour's gross margin fell by more than a percentage point to 47.5% of sales as it increased promotions. Moreover, Plank and his team see profitability continuing to shrink. In an update to their long-term guidance, the management team lowered its operating profit forecast through 2018, which likely explains the stock's drop on Tuesday. The company left its aggressive sales forecast in place, though, so its market-beating growth potential is still in place, even if shareholders will have to wait longer for the profit payoff. Procter & Gamble's solid sales growth Procter & Gamble's stock jumped 3% after the consumer goods titan announced its best growth pace in years. Organic sales rose by 3%, compared to 2% in the prior quarter, which got P&G off to a strong start in its new fiscal year.  Image source: P&G. Notably, P&G's gains were driven by higher sales volume and not just increased prices. The company has now posted two straight quarters of volume-powered growth to add weight to management's aim to boost overall sales by 2% this year, compared to 1% in fiscal 2016. At the same time, cost cuts produced plenty of excess cash that P&G could direct toward increasing its marketing investments while still boosting profits. The company's core earnings rose by 12%, compared to an 8% decline last quarter. "We delivered broad-based organic sales growth improvement across product categories and markets, as well as strong cost savings," CEO David Taylor said in a press release. The strong results weren't good enough to convince management to boost its outlook. P&G still sees a tough global selling environment keeping growth to a minimum this year. However, with its new, more profitable portfolio finally in place, and with sales volumes picking up, it is likely the maker of Tide detergent and Gillette razors will soon reverse the market share declines that have eaten into earnings over the last two years.

Primer: First District Court of Appeals Judge: Stautberg vs. Zayas-Davis Mary Schrott, Enquirer contributor 1:52 p.m. EDT October 27, 2016 Peter Stautberg (Photo: Provided) Attorney Marilyn Zayas-Davis, who has an immigration law-centered private practice in downtown Cincinnati, is challenging Peter Stautberg for one of the six judge slots on the Hamilton County First District Court of Appeals. Stautberg, the incumbent, was appointed to the job by Gov. John Kasich in March, 2015. He’s a former state representative and vice president of Fifth Third Bank. He touted his seven months of experience and 36 opinions on the bench. “I want [voters] to know that I am forthright, hard working, and always out to do the best job that I can do in being fair and rendering justice,” Stautberg said in an interview. Zayas-Davis is making her first bid for a judgeship after a nearly 20-year career in private practice arguing cases in county, state and federal courts. Earlier, she was an assistant prosecutor and worked at Procter & Gamble. She also has a colorful campaign theme: purple. “Purple is the color of inclusion and professionalism,” Zayas-Davis said, passing boxes in her downtown office of campaign T-shirts, posters, flyers, stickers and yard signs all popping with the purple slogan “Marilyn Zayas-Davis For Judge.” In 2001, right after she started her law practice MZD Law in Cincinnati, she won the case State of Ohio v. Yanez . She represented Antonio Yanez, who appealed a guilty plea to two counts of aggravated vehicular assault because the court, before accepting his plea, failed to explain the risk of deportation and being blocked from naturalization if he was convicted. Zayas-Davis won the case in the First District Court of Appeals, the court she now wants to join. “I want everyone that comes to the Court of Appeals to have a meaningful opportunity to be heard,” says Zayas-Davis, who is fluent in Spanish. In 2013, Zayas-Davis won the Distinguished Hispanic Ohioan Award from the Ohio Commission of Hispanic and Latino Affairs. If elected, she would be the only Democrat on the six-judge panel. The First District Court of Appeals is one of 12 of Ohio’s appellate districts. It reviews appeals from lower courts such as Municipal and Common Pleas. The term for this judge slot ends in February 2019. Peter Stautberg Stautberg is a lifelong Cincinnatian. “When I was in law school and as a young lawyer, you're looking at opportunities to give back to the community, and being a judge was always out there as being something to look for,” he recalls in an interview. He also has served the public as a state legislator for the 34th and 27th districts. Stautberg chaired the house’s Public Utilities Committee, and was a member of the Judiciary and Finance & Appropriations committees. He sponsored 19 bills and co-sponsored 127 bills during his tenure. One of the bills he sponsored in 2014, Senate Bill 310, enacted a two-year freeze on Ohio’s renewable energy and energy efficiency standards, causing public outrage. Citizens argued the bill put clean energy jobs at risk. The Ohio Chamber of Commerce and the utility First Energy and American Legislative Exchange Council had pushed to roll back the standards. The bill was signed privately by Gov. Kasich, who issued no statement afterward. Stautberg says his love for the Queen City, as well as his six years representing Ohio’s 27th House District, creates a strong tie with voters. “My heart has always been here. Voters know where I come from, they know who I am and many people even know my family,” he explains. During his campaigning, Stautberg hopes to educate people about what he does as a judge as well as what the appeals court is. “The law is about learning, the law is about informing and it's all about helping people,” Stautberg explains. “I like that ability to council.” Marilyn Zayas-Davis  (Photo: Provided) Marilyn Zayas-Davis A New York native, Zayas-Davis came to Cincinnati to work for Procter & Gamble. In 1994, she enrolled full time in the University of Cincinnati College of Law. Part of Zayas-Davis’ passion for education and serving her community comes from her upbringing in Washington Heights, a drug-torn neighborhood in New York City. While her Puerto Rican immigrant parents worked hard to provide for her family, she says she truly felt at home after moving to Cincinnati. “Cincinnati is my beloved adopted home,” Zayas-Davis explains. “Cincinnatians are good people who care very deeply about family values and community.” The ability to share ideas among the six judges on the Court of Appeals bench has an important appeal for Zayas-Davis. “It’s about a meaningful exchange of ideas and perspectives,” she elaborates on the judging process. “When justice is properly served, it’s a very powerful thing. Justice isn't about winning or losing – it’s about being understood and being heard.” Regardless, all judges run as non-partisans, which Zayas-Davis believes is wonderful because “It’s really about the person not the party.” As judge, Zayas-Davis states she “will be an appellate judge that applies the law consistently, without bias, even candidly.” While Zayas-Davis and Stautberg are competitors, they both agree on the importance of voters focusing on the down ballot. “It’s really is our local races that affect our lives more directly and more often than what happens in Washington,” Zayas-Davis explains. Adds Stautberg, “The further down you go the more local and impactful those candidate are. It’s really important that you understand it does matter, every vote for every candidate.” Mary Schrott is part of a Miami University partnership helping The Enquirer cover the election.

Weaker oil prices also cast a pall. KEEPING SCORE: Japan’s Nikkei 225 wavered into a modest gain by midday, adding 0.1 percent to 17,379.25, but most other regional benchmarks fell. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng dropped 0.7 percent to 23,403.44 and Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 dropped 1.5 percent to 5,359.40. South Korea’s Kospi lost 1.5 percent to 2,007.38 and India’s Sensex lost 0.7 percent to 27,895.12. Markets in Southeast Asia and Taiwan also fell. WALL STREET BLUES: Disappointing third-quarter earnings from big name companies raised worries over consumer spending, a critical driver of U.S. growth. Sherwin-Williams had its worst day in seven years, losing 10.9 percent, while Whirlpool plunged 10.8 percent. Athletic wear maker Under Armour’s shares sank 13.2 percent, its biggest drop in almost eight years. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.3 percent to 18,169.27, the Standard & Poor’s 500 index gave up 0.4 percent to 2,143.16 and the Nasdaq composite shed 0.5 percent, to 5,283.40. ANALYST VIEWPOINT: “U.S. equities turned lower overnight as the U.S. Consumer Confidence Index printed well below market expectations,” Illka Gobius of OANDA said in a commentary. “We could see further pressure on equity markets because oil prices plunged in late N.Y. trade” after the American Petroleum Institute reported a much larger than expected buildup in U.S. crude inventories. APPLE EARNINGS: After U.S. markets closed, Apple reported lower quarterly sales, another dispiriting factor given the many Asian manufacturers that are suppliers for the iPhone and other Apple products. “Apple’s numbers after-market look quite uninspiring and we are seeing shares down 2.5 percent in after-hours trade,” Chris Weston of IG said in a research note. OIL PRICES: Benchmark U.S. crude fell 65 cents to $49.31 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It lost 56 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $49.96 per barrel on Tuesday. Brent crude, the international standard, dropped 58 cents to $50.21 a barrel. It fell 67 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $50.79 a barrel in London. CURRENCIES: The dollar rose to 104.35 yen from 104.12 yen. The euro rose to $1.0890 from $1.0879. ___ AP Markets Writer Marley Jay contributed to this report.

(AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) FILE - This Jan. 4, 2010, file photo shows an historic marker on Wall Street in New York. Stocks opened slightly lower on Wall Street, Tuesday, Oct. 25, 2016, as some companies issue disappointing earnings and forecasts. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) Single page Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (1) New York • Shaky results from consumer companies dragged the U.S. stock market lower on Tuesday as shares of well-known names like appliance maker Whirlpool and athletic apparel maker Under Armour suffered their worst declines in years. Third-quarter earnings continued to dominate the market and some of the biggest companies either reported disappointing results or lowered their expectations. Investors wondered if consumers will spend less money on home improvement, clothing and other goods. But companies including Procter & Gamble and Lockheed Martin soared after their reports. Looking for safer options, some investors bought bonds and utility company shares. Consumer spending is critical to the U.S. economy and poor results for consumer-focused companies could be a sign of trouble. But Doug Roman, managing director of equities for PNC Capital Advisors, said it's too soon to know if shoppers are closing their wallets. VIDEOS TOP JOBS "The market might be extrapolating bigger stories into broader themes, which might not be the case," he said. Corporate earnings have been falling for more than a year, and despite Tuesday's results, investors are growing hopeful that streak is ending. The Dow Jones industrial average shed 53.76 points, or 0.3 percent, to 18,169.27. The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 8.17 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,143.16. The Nasdaq composite fell 26.43 points, or 0.5 percent, to 5,283.40. Paint and coatings maker Sherwin-Williams posted a disappointing profit and cut its annual guidance because of slower sales growth combined with spending on new stores. Meanwhile appliance maker Whirlpool's results fell far short of analyst projections. Sherwin-Williams had its worst day in seven years as it lost $30.27, or 10.9 percent, to $247.61. Whirlpool, which owns Maytag and KitchenAid, sank $18.37, or 10.8 percent, to $152.09, its largest loss in five years. Home improvement retailers Home Depot and Lowe's and flooring maker Mohawk Industries all slumped. So did automaker General Motors, which reported solid earnings. Under Armour reported its slowest sales growth in six years and said its future sales won't be as strong as it expected a year ago. Its stock tumbled $5.01, or 13.2 percent, to $32.89, its biggest drop in almost eight years. Rival Nike also slipped. Meanwhile a report showed that consumer confidence fell in October as consumers got a bit more pessimistic about business conditions and their employment prospects. The Conference Board had said consumer confidence reached a 20-month high in September. Procter & Gamble, which makes Tide detergent and Charmin toilet paper, had its best day in more than a year after it reported better results than investors expected. The consumer products giant has been selling some businesses to cut costs, and it posted stronger sales of personal care products like toothbrushes and deodorants. Its stock rose $2.87, or 3.4 percent, to $86.97, Aerospace and defense company Lockheed Martin surpassed investor forecasts and raised its projections for the year. Its stock gained $17.10, or 7.4 percent, to $249.26, its biggest leap in seven years. The reports continued to stream in after the market closed. Apple reported lower quarterly sales and sold fewer iPhones, sending its stock down about 2 percent in late trading. The company did give a better-than-expected forecast for the holiday season. Oil and gas drilling services company Baker Hughes disclosed a smaller loss than investors expected. Investors were also pleased that Baker Hughes is preparing to cut more costs. The company said it plans to eliminate $650 million in spending this year, up from the $500 million it had planned to cut. It climbed $2.24, or 4.3 percent, to $54.39. Waters Corp., which makes products used in drug development, announced weak revenue as demand from governments, research institutions and industries fell. The stock slid $19.15, or 12.1 percent, to $138.60. Drugmaker Merck raised its forecasts after it reported a bigger profit on greater sales of vaccines and cancer medicines. The company has also been trying to keep is spending in check. The stock rose $1.20, or 2 percent, to $61.95. 3M, which makes Post-it notes, industrial coatings and ceramics, forecast weaker sales growth and a smaller profit for the year. The stock declined $5.04, or 2.9 percent, to $166.23. Elevator and jet engine manufacturer United Technologies raised its annual forecast after its third-quarter profit surpassed analyst estimates. Its stock gained $1.84, or 1.8 percent, to $101.36. » Next page...

The Dow Jones industrial average fell 54 points, or 0.3%, to close at 18,169. The Standard & Poor's 500 stock index fell 0.4% to 2143 and the Nasdaq composite was 0.5% lower to 5283. Quotes in the article Procter & Gamble Co PG ▼ 82.00 -1.07 -1.29% Caterpillar Inc CAT ▼ 92.34 -0.44 -0.47% United Technologies Corp UTX ▼ 106.50 -0.20 -0.19% Merck KGaA MKGAF ▲ 100.52 +0.42 +0.42% Wall Street got a large slate of earnings reports from Dow components, including well-received reports from P&G (PG), which reported organic growth of 3%, as well as United Technologies (UTX), and drug maker Merck (MRK), which topped forecast with the help of strong sales of its cancer drug Keytruda. But the good news was offset by weaker-than-expected results from companies like 3M (MMM) and Caterpillar (CAT), which cut its earnings view for the remainder of 2016, citing sluggish sales of its heavy equipment. P&G shares rose 3.4%. Merck's stock rose 2%. And United Technologies shares jumped 1.9%. Caterpillar fell 1.8% and 3M fell 3%. Shares of Dow component and chemical giant DuPont (DD) fell 0.7% despite topping profit and sales forecast and boosting its full-year 2016 earnings outlook. 3M shares fell 3% and Caterpillar's stock was unchanged. Caterpillar's outgoing CEO Doug Oberhelman, who is retiring later this year, painted a gloomy picture of the global economy, noting that "economic weakness throughout much of the world persists," in a press release containing the company's earnings results. With the presidential election now two weeks away, investors are also bracing for the homestretch of the campaign and gearing up for any potential surprises. Stocks have held up nicely in recent sessions as the third-quarter earnings season has gotten off to a better-than-expected start. Earnings growth for the July-thru-September quarter is above 1% currently, which has raised hopes that the quarterly streak of contracting earnings growth will end at four. In economic news, consumer confidence fell more than expected in October, according to the Conference Board. But data on the U.S. housing market remained solid. The S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller U.S. home price index rose 0.2% in August and another index that tracks purchase prices saw an uptick of 0.7% in August, according to FHFA. iPhone maker Apple reported its quarterly profit results after today's closing bell.

KEEPING SCORE: The Dow Jones industrial average shed 47 points, or 0.3 percent, to 18,176 as of 12:45 p.m. Eastern time. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index lost 8 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,143. The Nasdaq composite fell 28 points, or 0.5 percent, to 5,282. BAD FIT: Under Armour reported its slowest sales growth in six years and said its future sales won’t be as strong as it expected a year ago. Its stock tumbled $5.09, or 13.4 percent, to $32.81. Under Armour traded above $50 a share a little more than a year ago. PAINT IT BLACK: Paint and coatings maker Sherwin-Williams posted a profit that was smaller than expected. The company cut its annual guidance because of slower sales growth combined with spending on new stores. Its stock lost $27.88, or 10 percent, to $250. FOCUS: Procter & Gamble, the company that makes Tide detergent and Charmin toilet paper, reported better results than investors expected. The consumer products giant has been selling some businesses to cut costs, and it posted stronger sales of personal care products like toothbrushes and deodorants. Its stock rose $3.28, or 3.9 percent, to $87.38. ALL WET: Appliance maker Whirlpool’s results fell far short of analyst projections. The maker of Maytag and KitchenAid products sank $19.22, or 11.3 percent, to $151.24. A GUSHER: Oil and gas drilling services company Baker Hughes disclosed a smaller loss than investors expected. Investors were also pleased that Baker Hughes is preparing to cut more costs. The company said it plans to eliminate $650 million in spending this year, up from the $500 million it had planned to cut. It climbed $2.40, or 4.6 percent, to $54.55. SLOWING TO A TRICKLE: Waters Corp., which makes products used in drug development, announced weak revenue as demand from governments, research institutions and industries fell. The stock slid $18.09, or 11.5 percent, to $139.66. AIMING HIGH: Aerospace and defense company Lockheed Martin surpassed investor forecasts and raised its projections for the year. Its stock gained $15.03, or 6.5 percent, to $247.19. TAP THE BRAKES: General Motors had a strong quarter but investors sent its stock down $1.34, or 4.1 percent, to $31.64. U.S. auto sales have risen to record highs and recently they’ve showed some signs of slowing down, which has left investors worried about GM’s growth. MERCK MAKES MORE: Drugmaker Merck raised its forecasts after it reported a bigger profit on greater sales of vaccines and cancer medicines. The company has also been trying to keep is spending in check. The stock rose 95 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $61.70. 3M GETS STUCK: 3M, which makes Post-it notes, industrial coatings and ceramics, forecast weaker sales growth and a smaller profit for the year. The stock declined 5.34, or 3.1 percent, to $165.94. GOING UP: Elevator and jet engine manufacturer United Technologies raised its annual forecast after its third-quarter profit surpassed analyst estimates. Its stock gained $2.11, or 2.1 percent, to $101.63. THIS WON’T GET GOOD RATINGS: Media and marketing information company Nielsen reported shaky results and cut its guidance, which sent its stock down $7.88, or 14.3 percent, to $47.05. CONSUMER CONFIDENCE: American consumers felt less confident this month, according to the Conference Board. Consumer confidence was lower than expected. The measurement rose to a 20-month high in September. OIL: Benchmark U.S. crude lost 59 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $49.93 per barrel in New York. Brent crude, the international standard, fell 66 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $50.80 a barrel in London. However energy companies held steady thanks to big gains for Baker Hughes and to oil refiner Valero, which reported strong results and jumped $2.47, or 4.4 percent, to $58.63. BONDS: Bond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 1.75 percent from 1.77 percent. CURRENCIES: The dollar slipped to 104.20 yen from 104.24 yen. The euro fell to $1.0885 from $1.0879. OVERSEAS: In Britain the FTSE 100 rose 0.4 percent while France’s CAC 40 lost 0.3 percent and the DAX in Germany was little changed. Japan’s Nikkei 225 rose 0.8 percent and South Korea’s Kospi fell 0.5 percent.

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Wednesday, 26 October 2016 | MYT 1:18 AM P&G profit beats on cost cuts, demand for home care goods This AFP file photo taken on July 15, 2008, shows P&G's corporate headquarters in Cincinnati, Ohio. BENGALURU: Procter & Gamble Co (P&G), the maker of Tide detergent and Pampers diapers, reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit, helped by cost-cutting and strong demand for its baby, feminine and home care products. P&G’s shares were up 4.6% at US$87.97 on Tuesday morning. The company has been selling off unprofitable brands and focusing on core brands such as Tide, Pampers and Gillette to revive sluggish sales. P&G sold 41 of its brands, including Clairol and Wella, to Coty Inc in a US$12.5bil deal earlier this month. P&G is also planning to save as much as US$10bil in costs over the next five years, after cutting the same amount in costs over the last five years. The company plans to reinvest a significant portion of savings from the new plan in product and packaging improvement, research and development, and expanding sales coverage, P&G’s chief financial officer Jon Moeller said on a media call. Organic sales in P&G’s fabric and home care business - its largest - rose 4 percent in the first quarter, while those in baby, feminine and family care, the second largest, rose 2%. The two businesses, which house brands such as Tide, Febreze, Pampers and Tampex, together accounted for 60% of the company’s total revenue. P&G’s revenue was driven by “solid” volume growth of 3% in the quarter, in contrast to rivals such as Unilever, whose sales were mainly propped up by price hikes, Jefferies analyst Kevin Grundy wrote in a note. Net sales remained largely flat at US$16.52bil in the quarter ended Sept 30, but beat the average estimate of US$16.49bil, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales in the United Kingdom, P&G’s largest European market, fell 2% in the quarter, Moeller said. Britain’s vote to leave the European Union has caused a plunge in the pound, leading consumer goods makers such as Unilever to attempt to raise prices in the market. Moeller declined to discuss P&G’s pricing strategy, but said the UK continued to be a “very challenging and highly promotional” market. P&G said net income attributable to the company rose 4.3% to US$2.71bil, or 96 cents per share. Excluding items, P&G earned US$1.03 per share from continuing operations, beating the average analyst estimate of 98 cents. P&G’s quarterly sales have been mostly falling for more than three years, as the company has been cutting its brand portfolio. - Reuters Tags / Keywords: Foreign News , Corporate News , Procter Gamble , Consumer Products Related Stories P&G officially appoints KTC Consolidated as distributor in Sarawak Kim Teck Cheong appointed as Procter & Gamble distributor Berkshire preliminary Q1 operating profit falls US-Asean Business Council takes lead to boost SMEs P&G to regroup products into four sectors You May Be Interested ECB chief Draghi hints at more stimulus to come Daibochi bullish on Myanmar venture Mah Sing group MD wins property award The gig economy only a stopgap measure to our woes KTC sees good year ahead Rejuvenate yourself with American ginseng Others Also Read Tesla's Musk closes SolarCity deal, more challenges lie ahead Tourists now prefer lodgings with Airbnb flavour, hoteliers told Mali's local elections marred by protests, boycotts Property Related advertisement Latest News A ‘Yan’ to be the best Inevitable, essential failure Reflections on Budget 2017 Briefs Too premature to make final decision on TPP, says Mustapa Most Viewed in Business Governor: Bank Negara won’t tolerate ringgit transactions in NDF market PNB unit trust funds hit 210.63 billion units as of October Too premature to make final decision on TPP, says Mustapa advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online   Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

Most Popular Procter & Gamble Co. today solved the mystery behind a series of disappointing top-line results from household and personal-care marketers, posting an upside surprise with 3% organic sales growth for last quarter despite retail scanner data that pointed to much flatter growth. Jon Moeller Credit: Procter & Gamble Co. In calls with media and analysts, Chief Financial Officer Jon Moeller pegged some of the divergence on P&G growing much faster and gaining share in e-commerce, which accounted for about a percentage point of sales growth in the U.S. and 5 points in China. E-commerce sales aren't tracked by easily available syndicated retail sales data. Mr. Moeller also noted that analyst scanner data still rightly includes such brands as CoverGirl and Clairol spun off to Coty Oct. 1, but which were discontinued operations not counted in P&G's financial results. And P&G gained from shipments to fill the pipeline for a new distributor in Hong Kong – but that only affected numbers by around 0.1 percentage point globally. In a sign that foreign-exchange pressure is abating, P&G's unadjusted sales were at least flat after several quarters of decline, and its reported net earnings grew 5% in absolute terms after an extended period of currency-fueled declines. P&G also continued to boost ad spending faster than sales, as it has in the past year, and continued to cut marketing costs, both by unspecified amounts. And the company continued to invest in sampling too, which got a fairly impassioned defense from Mr. Moeller. Related Stories Unilever Agrees to Buy Seventh Generation, Continuing CPG Shopping Spree P&G's Pritchard: Time to Cut the Crap -- and the Pressure on Agencies P&G Results Disappoint Wall Street He said P&G had cut spending on promotion in the past because it doesn't deliver immediate results. But he said sampling can win consumers long term in categories with high brand loyalty even though short-term results are actually depressed, because people are using their samples rather than buying the product immediately. Sampling, he said, "is the area of spending that should be the last that we cut, because of its importance in building users for potentially a lifetime of consumption." Overall, P&G's top-line beat wasn't that far off a consensus 2.4% prediction from analysts. But it followed top-line reports by rivals in the past week that have been weaker than expected, particularly in volume terms, from rivals that have been consistently beating P&G of late – including Unilever, RB (Reckitt Benckiser) and Kimberly-Clark Corp. The last yesterday reported flat organic sales growth, with Chairman-CEO Tom Falk citing in part aggressive pricing and promotion from P&G, particularly around deep discounts on adult incontinence products and strong execution of in-store promotions around the Summer Olympics. P&G's organic sales and volume both grew 3% last quarter. But that masked more aggressive pricing in developed markets, where sales grew at 2%, only half the 4% increase in volume. P&G's volume actually grew slower in historically faster-growing developing markets, where it was up 2% on 6% higher sales, driven by price hikes to compensate for currencies declining against the dollar. In question and answer, Bernstein Securities analyst Ali Dibadj raised the prospect of a price war, but Mr. Moeller said P&G's policy continues to be avoiding price promotion because it doesn't deliver sustainable long-term results. But he acknowledged that competitive response is among factors that could make P&G's top line growth bumpy through the remainder of the year. "We will take moves, where warranted, to ensure that we're offering a competitive value proposition to consumers," he said. "We've made several of those moves in the last quarter. What moves happen in the future will be largely dependent on where others take us." P&G's 3% fiscal first-quarter sales gain comes against an easy comparison to a 1% decline a year-ago, and P&G didn't adjust its full-year forecast of 2% growth. But the momentum in the U.S. has been particularly pronounced, from a 1% sales increase in P&G's fiscal first half last year and 2% in the second half up to 3% last quarter. Despite every P&G business sector seeing at least 2% organic sales growth – a rarity in recent years – Mr. Moeller said P&G is still growing below the market in such categories as hair and baby care and U.S. grooming. The company has plans to address that, he said, including a restage of Herbal Essences early next year. Mr. Moeller brushed aside the suggestion in another analyst question that P&G may need to make acquisitions akin to what rival Unilever has done in recent months with Dollar Shave Club and Seventh Generation. The Honest Co., selling environmentally friendly products largely direct to consumers, remains up for sale, according to published reports. Mr. Moeller noted P&G has increased its offerings of environmentally sustainable products in recent years, including Tide Coldwater and Tide PurClean. And he said only 0.3% of P&G's sales are direct to consumers for good reason: Consumers prefer buying packaged goods from big retailers for convenience. "How many people do you know," he said, "that want to satisfy their household shopping needs in a month or two by going to 40 different websites with 40 different passwords and 40 different packages that arrive at 40 different times?"

"Following" : "Follow"}} October 25, 2016 11:41am   Comments Share: Related UA Under Armour To Open Detroit Location How Much Value Does Fitbit Offer Potential Buyers? Under Armour slumps on Curry 3 concern (Seeking Alpha) Despite the fact that Under Armour Inc (NYSE: UA) tumbled more than 14 percent Tuesday, analysts at Buckingham remain optimistic on the company's prospects. BRG's Scott Krasik maintained a Buy rating and $48 price target on Under Armour's stock following the company's Q3 earnings report. Related Link: Why Under Armour Stock Is Tumbling Krasik went on to counter some of the negative data points hurting Under Armour's stock. Specifically, the analyst argued that concerns of elevated inventory are now irrelevant since inventory at the end of Q3 grew at just half the rate of sales. Krasik added that concerns of a notable slowdown in footwear sales growth are overblown since the company did grow its footwear sales at twice the rate of its apparel growth. Meanwhile, all of Under Armour's vital growth channels were strong in the third quarter, including international sales which rose 74 percent and footwear sales rising 42 percent. In addition, Under Armour's 18 percent rise in apparel sales is "solid" given the "tail-end of inventory dislocation at retail." With that said, the analyst suggested Under Armour's story is "cleaner than it has been in almost a year with the long-term growth opportunities intact." Looking forward, Krasik is expecting: 1) gross margins to improve sequentially, 2) international growth to remain elevated and become more profitable, 3) North American distribution will broaden in a productive manner, and 4) management will continue investing in long-term initiatives. Bottom line, the analyst continues to believe Under Armour remains "the best growth story in consumer and would begin or add to positions at current levels."

Stocks opened slightly lower on Wall Street, Tuesday, Oct. 25, 2016, as some companies issue disappointing earnings and forecasts. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... ..........TOKYO — Shares fell broadly in Asia on Wednesday after a gloomy session on Wall Street, where shares of household names like appliance maker Whirlpool and athletic apparel maker Under Armour suffered their worst declines in years. Weaker oil prices also cast a pall. KEEPING SCORE: Japan’s Nikkei 225 wavered into a modest gain by midday, adding 0.1 percent to 17,379.25, but most other regional benchmarks fell. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng dropped 0.7 percent to 23,403.44 and Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 dropped 1.5 percent to 5,359.40. South Korea’s Kospi lost 1.5 percent to 2,007.38 and India’s Sensex lost 0.7 percent to 27,895.12. Markets in Southeast Asia and Taiwan also fell. WALL STREET BLUES: Disappointing third-quarter earnings from big name companies raised worries over consumer spending, a critical driver of U.S. growth. Sherwin-Williams had its worst day in seven years, losing 10.9 percent, while Whirlpool plunged 10.8 percent. Athletic wear maker Under Armour’s shares sank 13.2 percent, its biggest drop in almost eight years. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.3 percent to 18,169.27, the Standard & Poor’s 500 index gave up 0.4 percent to 2,143.16 and the Nasdaq composite shed 0.5 percent, to 5,283.40. ANALYST VIEWPOINT: “U.S. equities turned lower overnight as the U.S. Consumer Confidence Index printed well below market expectations,” Illka Gobius of OANDA said in a commentary. “We could see further pressure on equity markets because oil prices plunged in late N.Y. trade” after the American Petroleum Institute reported a much larger than expected buildup in U.S. crude inventories. APPLE EARNINGS: After U.S. markets closed, Apple reported lower quarterly sales, another dispiriting factor given the many Asian manufacturers that are suppliers for the iPhone and other Apple products. “Apple’s numbers after-market look quite uninspiring and we are seeing shares down 2.5 percent in after-hours trade,” Chris Weston of IG said in a research note. OIL PRICES: Benchmark U.S. crude fell 65 cents to $49.31 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It lost 56 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $49.96 per barrel on Tuesday. Brent crude, the international standard, dropped 58 cents to $50.21 a barrel. It fell 67 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $50.79 a barrel in London. CURRENCIES: The dollar rose to 104.35 yen from 104.12 yen. The euro rose to $1.0890 from $1.0879. Advertisement Continue reading ___ AP Markets Writer Marley Jay contributed to this report.

Stocks opened slightly lower on Wall Street, Tuesday, Oct. 25, 2016, as some companies issue disappointing earnings and forecasts. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks are mostly lower Tuesday morning as company earnings continue to stream in. Consumer companies are falling as athletic apparel maker Under Armour and appliance maker Whirlpool suffer hefty losses. However strong results for household goods maker Procter & Gamble send its stock higher. KEEPING SCORE: The Dow Jones industrial average picked up 13 points, or 0.1 percent, to 18,236 as of 10:15 a.m. Eastern time. The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 1 point, or 0.1 percent, to 2,150. The Nasdaq composite fell 4 points, or 0.1 percent, to 5,305. BAD FIT: Under Armour reported strong third-quarter results, but the company said it expects slower sales growth. Its stock tumbled $5.04, or 13.3 percent, to $32.87 Under Armour traded above $50 a share a little more than a year ago. PAINT IT BLACK: Paint and coatings maker Sherwin-Williams posted a profit that was smaller than expected. The company cut its annual guidance because of slower sales growth combined with spending on new stores. Its stock lost $27.08, or 9.7 percent, to $250.80. FOCUS: Procter & Gamble, the company that makes Tide detergent and Charmin toilet paper, reported better results than investors expected. The consumer products giant has been selling some businesses to cut costs, and it posted stronger sales of personal care products like toothbrushes and deodorants. Its stock rose $3.63, or 4.3 percent, to $87.73. Procter & Gamble is a Dow component and pulled that index higher. ALL WET: Appliance maker Whirlpool's results fell far short of analyst projections. The maker of Maytag and KitchenAid products gave up $16.63, or 9.8 percent, to $153.83. A GUSHER: Oil and gas drilling services company Baker Hughes disclosed a smaller loss than investors expected. Investors were also pleased that Baker Hughes is preparing to cut more costs. The company said it plans to eliminate $650 million in spending this year, up from the $500 million it had planned to cut. It climbed $3.81, or 7.3 percent, to $55.96. SLOWING TO A TRICKLE: Waters Corp., which makes products used in drug development, announced weak revenue as demand from governments, research institutions and industries fell. The stock slid $14.22, or 9 percent, to $143.53. AIMING HIGH: Aerospace and defense company Lockheed Martin surpassed investor forecasts and raised its projections for the year. Its stock gained $11.24, or 4.8 percent, to $243.40. OIL: Benchmark U.S. crude lost 10 cents to $50.42 per barrel in New York. Brent crude, the international standard, fell 16 cents to $51.30 a barrel in London. However energy companies traded higher thanks to Baker Hughes and to oil refiner Valero, which reported strong results and jumped $2.57, or 4.6 percent, to $58.73. BONDS: Bond prices edged higher. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 1.76 percent from 1.77 percent. CURRENCIES: The dollar climbed to 104.74 yen from 104.24 yen. The euro fell to $1.0858 from $1.0879. ASIA'S DAY: In Britain the FTSE 100 jumped 1 percent while France's CAC 40 gained 0.1 percent. The DAX in Germany rose 0.3 percent. Japan's Nikkei 225 rose 0.8 percent and South Korea's Kospi fell 0.5 percent. ___ AP Markets Writer Marley Jay can be reached at http://twitter.com/MarleyJayAP His work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/journalist/marley-jay Tags Business General News Consumer Product Manufacturing Oil And Gas Industry Aerospace And Defense Industry Financial Performance Corporate News Consumer Products And Services Energy Industry Industrial Products And Services Stock Markets Financial Markets Products And Services Commodity Markets Locations United States North America Popular This Week Wake Forest investigating if Louisville knew too much; Petrino responds Winston-Salem man found beaten Tuesday in downtown restaurant parking lot Lesbian couple gets 'Trump train' note Smoke from wildfires forces Forsyth County to issue air quality alert GOP official alleges illegal voting in Forsyth One of Forsyth County's oldest unsolved homicides remains a secret 47 years later 91-year-old woman dies after being hurt in Winston-Salem traffic crash; 96-year-old driver cited Racist post about Michelle Obama causes backlash School board pays $365,000 to settle suit over employee sex with student State GOP leaders could neutralize Democrats' Supreme Court majority by adding justices Poll Do you think that grassroot activists' petitions could have an effect on the Electoral College vote in this year's election?

As ações da P&G subiam mais de 4 por cento nesta terça-feira. A empresa tem vendido marcas não rentáveis ​​e focado nas marcas principais, como Tide, Pampers e Gillette, para reavivar vendas fracas. A P&G vendeu 41 das suas marcas, incluindo Clairol e Wella, para a Coty em um negócio 12,5 bilhões de dólares no início deste mês. A P&G também está reduzindo os custos através de um plano multianual para economizar até 10 bilhões de dólares. A companhia, com base em Cincinnati, no Estado norte-americano de Ohio, informou que o lucro líquido atribuível à empresa subiu para 2,71 bilhões de dólares, ou 0,96 dólar por ação, no primeiro trimestre encerrado em 30 de setembro, ante 2,6 bilhões de dólares, ou 0,91 dólar por ação, um ano antes. Excluindo itens, a P&G lucrou 1,03 dólar por ação nas operações continuadas, superando ligeiramente a estimativa média de analistas de 0,98 dólar, segundo a Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. A receita líquida permaneceu praticamente estável em 16,52 bilhões de dólares, mas acima da estimativa média de 16,49 bilhões de dólares dos analistas.

Weitere Informationen... So., 20. Nov 2016, 19:16 MEZ - Deutsche Märkte geschlossen Stocks close lower after mixed earnings results; consumer stocks fall 1%Von Fred Imbert | CNBC – Di., 25. Okt 2016 22:31 MESZ Freigeben 0 Twittern 0 Share0 Drucken Firmen: Dow Jones Industrial Average The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. AKTUELLER KURS Symbol Kurs Veränderung ^DJI 18.867,93 -35,89 GS 210,35 +0,72 U.S. stocks closed lower on Tuesday as one of the busiest days of the earnings season got under way, while oil prices slipped. "Some of the earnings that have come out have been disappointing and you have oil [lower]," said Craig Sterling, head of U.S. equity research at Pioneer Investments. "The market is kind of aimless here today." The Dow Jones industrial average closed about 50 points lower, with 3M contributing the most losses to the tune of nearly 33 points, offsetting a gain of approximately 20 points from Procter & Gamble (PG). The S&P 500 dropped around 0.4 percent, with consumer discretionary falling 1.2 percent to lead decliners. The Nasdaq composite underperformed, falling about half a percent. Earlier, the three major indexes traded slightly higher. "I think oil prices combined with the dollar" are pressuring stocks, said Kim Forrest, senior equity analyst at Fort Pitt Capital. "Our companies don't like that." The U.S. dollar (STOXX:.DXY) traded flat to lower against a basket of currencies, near 98.69, after breaking above 99 for the first time since February, according to FactSet. The euro (Exchange:EUR=) traded near $1.089, while the yen (Exchange:JPY=) traded around 104.2. "The US dollar certainly has had a nice bid over the past three weeks as its clear the Fed is trying to getting away with another hike by yr end but as it will come in the context of a 1.5% US growth story," Peter Boockvar, chief market analyst at The Lindsey Group, said in a note. "I argue that the FX discussion will shift from an interest rate differential one to where the growth is. Thus, I think the US dollar is just moving to the upper end of its multi year range rather than being on the cusp of a breakout," he said. More than 90 companies were scheduled to post quarterly results on Tuesday. Dow components 3M (MMM), Caterpillar (CAT) and DuPont (DD) reported earnings before the bell. Caterpillar and 3M posted mixed results, as both beat estimates on the bottom line, while missing on revenues. Caterpillar also lowered its 2016 earnings per share guidance. "On balance, earnings have been better, but we've also had an upward trend in energy prices; that's flattened out a bit," said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities. "You need something to offset Under Armour being down." Under Armour (UA) shares fell more than 10 percent despite posting better-than-expected results. U.S. crude (New York Mercantile Exchange: @CL.1) for December delivery fell 56 cents, or 1.11 percent, to settle at $49.96 per barrel ahead of weekly inventory data and as verbal squabbles among between OPEC members created uncertainty about a potential output cut. "The picture is incredibly muddy and this is dragging the price of oil lower. Also if you look at the long term curve supply curve, Mexico and Brazil are both in vigorous war to attract interest from companies to drill in their deep water oil reserve," said Naeem Aslam, chief market strategist at Think Markets. Tech giant Apple (AAPL) is scheduled to report quarterly results Tuesday after the bell. "Earnings have been pretty good. I guess it's a question of waiting for the [Federal Reserve] as we face some technical resistance," said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial. Fort Pitt Capital's Forrest said the biggest question mark surrounding earnings remains in the consumer discretionary sector. "I think those who are doing well are going to do better, and those not doing well will be doing worse," she said. Stocks have held in a very narrow range recently, as the S&P 500 has around 1 percent over the past three months. "The SPX is making headway toward its 50-day moving average, a breakout above which would likely be seen as a positive technical catalyst that is reflective of improved short-term momentum," said Katie Stockton, chief technical strategist at BTIG, in a note. "There is room for upside follow-through per our overbought/oversold measures, which showed widespread oversold conditions last week among the constituents of the SPX," she said. S&P 500 3-month chartSource: FactSet The Fed is scheduled to hold its next monetary policy meeting next week, and it's largely expected to keep interest rates unchanged. Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart spoke on Tuesday, but did not comment on monetary policy as the central bank entered its self-imposed quiet period. "The more likely time for the Fed to move would be in December," said Ernie Cecilia, CIO at Bryn Mawr Trust. "As long as the data comes strong." In economic news, consumer confidence hit 98.6, with economists polled by Reuters expecting confidence to hit 101.5. Meanwhile, U.S. home prices rose slightly in August from July, with the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller 20-City Composite index gaining 5.1 percent year over year. U.S. Treasurys were mixed, with the two-year note yield near 0.85 percent and the benchmark 10-year yield around 1.76 percent. Overseas, European stocks fell, with the pan-European Stoxx 600 index (^STOXX) falling 0.35 percent. In Asia, stocks closed mixed, with the Nikkei 225 gaining 0.76 percent and the Korean Kospi falling 0.52 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average (Dow Jones Global Indexes: .DJI) fell 53.76 points, or 0.3 percent, to close at 18,169.27, with Home Depot leading decliners and Procter & Gamble the top advancer. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) slipped 8.17 points, or 0.38 percent, to end at 2,143.16, with consumer discretionary leading nine sectors lower and utilities and consumer staples the only advancers. The Nasdaq (^IXIC) dropped 26.43 points, or 0.5 percent, to 5,283.4. About nine stocks declined for every five advancers at the New York Stock Exchange, with an exchange volume of 530 million and a composite volume of 2.757 billion in afternoon trade. The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) (^VIX), widely considered the best gauge of fear in the market, traded higher, near 13.5, snapping a five-day losing streak. Gold futures for December delivery (CEC:Commodities Exchange Centre: @GC.1) rose $9.90 to settle at $1,273.60 per ounce.

Shares of the maker of Tide detergent and Charmin toilet paper gained more than 4 percent in afternoon trading Tuesday. P&G has been working on transforming its business to better focus on bigger brands with growth potential. The company has already shed some of the smaller brands it says collectively contribute little to its operating profit. FILE - This July 9, 2015, file photo, shows signage outside Procter & Gamble corporate headquarters in downtown Cincinnati. Procter & Gamble Co.'s fiscal first-quarter results beat Wall Street's view as it controlled expenses and saw solid sales growth in its health care segment, the company announced Tuesday, Oct. 25, 2016. (AP Photo/John Minchillo, File) Chairman, President and CEO David Taylor said in a written statement Tuesday that the company is "now focusing all our efforts on 10 large, structurally attractive categories where P&G holds leading positions." P&G, the world's largest consumer products maker, earned $2.71 billion, or 96 cents per share, for the period ended Sept. 30. A year ago the Cincinnati-based company earned $2.6 billion, or 91 cents per share. Earnings, adjusted to account for discontinued operations and restructuring costs, were $1.03 per share. That topped the 98 cents per share that analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research expected. Revenue was basically flat at $16.52 billion. Analysts polled by Zacks expected revenue of $16.45 billion. Sales for the health care unit climbed 4 percent, while sales for the fabric and home care division edged up 1 percent. For fiscal 2017, P&G still expects adjusted earnings per share growth of mid-single digits compared with fiscal 2016's earnings of $3.67 per share. Analysts polled by FactSet predict earnings of $3.88 per share. Its shares rose $3.48, or 4.1 percent, to $87.58 in afternoon trading Tuesday. Its shares are up 13 percent over the past year. ____ Elements of this story were generated by Automated Insights (http://automatedinsights.com/ap) using data from Zacks Investment Research.

(PG) on Tuesday reported a 4 percent increase in profit for the first quarter from last year on a slight decline in sales. However, both revenue and core earnings per share for the quarter beat analysts' estimates. In addition, the Cincinnati, Ohio-based maker of Tide detergent, Crest toothpaste and Gillette shaving razors affirmed its financial outlook for fiscal 2017. For the first quarter, net earnings attributable to P&G rose to $2.71 billion or $0.96 per share from $2.60 billion or $0.91 per share in the prior-year period. Core earnings from continuing operations were $1.03 per share, compared to $0.98 per share last year. On a currency-neutral basis, core earnings per share increased 12 percent. On average, analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected the company to earn $0.98 per share for the quarter. Analysts' estimates typically exclude special items. Net sales for the quarter were $16.52 billion, down slightly from $16.53 billion in the year-ago quarter. Analysts had a consensus revenue estimate of $16.49 billion. Sales for the quarter include a negative three percentage impact from foreign exchange. Organic sales increased 3 percent, driven by a three percent increase in organic shipment volume, and increased in all five business segments. All-in volume increased two percent. Gross margin expanded 30 basis points to 51.0 percent, while operating margin was flat with last year at 22.8 percent. Looking ahead to fiscal 2017, P&G affirmed its outlook for core earnings per share growth of mid-single digits versus fiscal 2016 core earnings per share of $3.67 and also maintained its projection for organic sales growth of about 2 percent. P&G expects the combined headwinds of foreign exchange and minor brand divestitures to reduce sales growth for the year by about one percentage point. As a result, the company continues to estimate all-in sales growth of about one percent for fiscal 2017. Analysts expect the company to report earnings of $3.88 per share for the year on revenues of $66.01 billion. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com Business News Preview: Thanksgiving Week Economic Data Top Ten Corporate Comeback Stories The Most Influential Books In Business More Top Stories Fiat Chrysler Recalls Cars For Wiper, Fuel Leak Issues Stocks Move Modestly Lower Amid Quiet Trading Day - U.S. Commentary Dupont Will No Longer Contribute To Pensions Fitch Warns On Trump Trade Policies Stocks Seeing Modest Weakness In Mid-Day Trading - U.S. Commentary Trump Taps Sessions As AG, Pompeo As CIA Director, Flynn As Security Advisor Stocks Showing A Lack Of Direction In Early Trading - U.S. Commentary U.S. Leading Economic Index Inches Higher For Second Straight Month Sen Sessions To Be Attorney General, Gen Flynn Touted As NSA: Reports CFO Shake-up For Actuant Ohio Congressman Challenges Nancy Pelosi For House Dem Leader Japanese Prime Minister Abe Says He Has Great Confidence In Trump Stocks May Show A Lack Of Direction In Early Trading - U.S. Commentary Trump Reportedly Picks Sen.

REUTERS/Andrew Kelly Enlarge Caption  Email More A A REUTERS: Procter & Gamble Co , the maker of Tide detergent and Pampers diapers, reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit, helped by cost-cutting and strong demand for its baby, feminine and home care products. P&G's shares were up 2.2 percent at US$86.00 in premarket trading on Tuesday. The company has been selling off unprofitable brands and focusing on core brands such as Tide, Pampers and Gillette to revive sluggish sales. P&G sold 41 of its brands, including Clairol and Wella, to Coty Inc in a US$12.5 billion deal earlier this month. P&G is also reducing costs through a multi-year plan to save up to US$10 billion. Cincinnati, Ohio-based P&G said net income attributable to the company rose to US$2.71 billion, or 96 cents per share, in the first quarter ended Sept. 30, from US$2.60 billion, or 91 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, P&G earned US$1.03 per share from continuing operations, slightly beating the average analyst estimate of 98 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net sales remained largely flat at US$16.52 billion, but beat analysts' average estimate of US$16.49 billion. P&G's quarterly sales have been mostly falling for more than three years, as the company has been cutting its brand portfolio.

Kostensenkungen und die Fokussierung auf ertragreiche Marken halfen dem Gewinn unter dem Strich um 4 Prozent auf 2,7 Milliarden US-Dollar nach oben, wie der Hersteller von Pampers, Gillette oder Ariel am Dienstag in Cincinnati mitteilte. Dies war mehr als Analysten erwartet hatte. Der weltweit größte Konsumgüterkonzern hatte große Teile seines Kosmetikgeschäfts, wozu auch der Haarpflegespezialist Wella gehörte, an den Parfümkonzern Coty verkauft. Die letzte Etappe dieser im Vorjahr angekündigten Transaktion sei nun erfolgt, hieß es. Den Erlös aus dem Geschäft will der Konzern im zweiten Quartal verbuchen. Der Umsatz belief sich in dem die Monate Juli bis September umfassenden ersten Quartal wie im Vorjahr auf 16,5 Milliarden Dollar, wobei vor allem Wechselkurseffekte bremsten. Ohne den Einfluss von Währungen und ohne Zu- und Verkäufe legten die Erlöse um 3 Prozent zu. Im Gesamtjahr 2016/2017 will der Konzern aus eigener Kraft um rund 2 Prozent wachsen. Auch der Gewinn soll dank des Coty-Geschäfts kräftig steigen./she/stb Empfehlen Drucken Bookmarken   NEWSLETTER Abonnieren Sie jetzt unseren aktuellen Newsletter WIRTSCHAFTSNACHRICHTEN 19:07 Uhr | 20.11.2016 'MM': Fielmann-Chef Günther ... 18:46 Uhr | 20.11.2016 Bayer hält Finanzierung der ... 18:07 Uhr | 20.11.2016 United Internet stellt höhere ... 17:56 Uhr | 20.11.2016 ROUNDUP: Obama nimmt Trump in ... 16:48 Uhr | 20.11.2016 Eon-Chef Teyssen zeigt sich trotz ...

The Cincinnati-based company reported fiscal Q1 EPS of $1.03, beating analyst expectations of $0.98. Revenue fell 0.1% from last year to $16.52 billion, but still topped Wall Street’s view of $16.48 billion. P&G also noted that organic sales increased in all five business segments, on low-to-mid single digit organic volume growth in all segments. Healthcare products, which include power toothbrushes and cold medicine, led the way with a 7% sales rise. Looking ahead, Procter & Gamble reaffirmed its prior full-year earnings guidance of $3.82 to $3.89 per share for the year (analysts are looking for $3.88). It also expects full-year fiscal 2017 revenues to rise 1% to approximately $65.95 billion, while analysts expect $66 billion in sales for the year. Organic sales are expected to gain 2%, and foreign exchange effects are expected to negatively impact sales growth by one percentage point. The company commented via press release: “Our first quarter results mark a good start to the fiscal year,” said Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer David Taylor. “We delivered broad-based organic sales growth improvement across product categories and markets, as well as strong cost savings. Earlier this month, we completed the last major step in P&G’s portfolio transformation with the Beauty Brands divestiture to Coty Inc. We are now focusing all our efforts on 10 large, structurally attractive categories where P&G holds leading positions. We’re pleased with the progress we’re making, but there is still more work to do to get back to the levels of balanced top- and bottom-line growth and cash generation that will consistently put P&G shareholder value creation among the best in our industry.” P&G shares rose $2.05 (+2.44%) to $86.15 in premarket trading Tuesday. Prior to today’s report, PG had gained 5.91%, putting it roughly in-line with the S&P 500’s return during the same period.

Organic sales  -- a measure that excludes the effects of currency exchange-rate fluctuations as well as acquisitions and divestitures -- rose in all five of P&G’s product divisions units last quarter, leading to a 3 percent gain companywide. And while total revenue still fell, it was the smallest decrease since 2014. David Taylor Source: Proctor & Gamble Co. The results signal that P&G’s strategy of divesting nonessential brands to focus on its main household and personal-care businesses is starting to pay off. The company completed the sale of more than 40 beauty brands to Coty Inc. this month, a move that Chief Executive Officer David Taylor called “the last major step” in P&G’s transformation of its portfolio.  “Now that that endeavor has wrapped, you’ll see their innovation efforts more focused, with the intent of being more responsive on a timely basis,” said Erin Lash, an analyst at Morningstar Inc. Tuesday’s results show the efforts are gaining traction. Profit was $1.03 a share, excluding some items, in P&G’s fiscal first quarter, which ended Sept. 30. Analysts estimated 98 cents, on average. Revenue slipped less than 0.1 percent to $16.5 billion, Cincinnati-based P&G said in a statement. That roughly matched analysts’ projections. The stock rose as much as 4.7 percent to $88.08 in New York, the biggest intraday increase in a year. P&G already had gained 5.9 percent this year through Monday. Organic sales advanced 3 percent in the grooming business, which includes Gillette shaving products. Sales by that measure climbed 3 percent in the beauty unit, which sells Pantene shampoo and Olay skincare products. The health care division, the maker of Crest toothpaste and Prilosec heartburn medicine, had the biggest organic sales increase at 7 percent. The fabric and home care unit posted a 4 percent organic sales gain, while the baby, feminine and family care business had a 2 percent advance. Volume Gains The companywide organic sales increase of 3 percent topped analysts’ consensus expectation of a 2 percent gain, Mark Astrachan, an analyst at Stifel Financial Corp., said in a note. Sales volumes rose 3 percent, marking the strongest performance since the third quarter of 2014, he said. He recommends buying the shares. P&G maintained its forecasts that organic sales would grow about 2 percent and adjusted earnings would increase at a mid-single-digit percentage rate in its current fiscal year. The company’s shrinking goes beyond divestments. Taylor has embarked on another $10 billion cost-cutting program -- the company’s second in five years -- and says he’ll invest some of the savings in research, development and marketing. Some of its efforts already paying off, Lash said. P&G’s single-load laundry detergents have been a success, as have the expanded sizes of its Pampers Swaddlers brand, which helped it overtake Kimberly-Clark Corp. -- the maker of Huggies -- in U.S. diaper market share. On Monday, Kimberly-Clark reported earnings that trailed analysts’ estimates and cut its annual sales forecast, with CEO Thomas Falk citing “a more challenging economic and competitive environment.” All big consumer-products companies are in a tough spot, with new competitors, stagnant demand in developed markets and slowing growth in developing ones, Lash said. “That is ultimately another reason why continuing to invest behind that product innovation is so crucial,” she said.

P&G's shares were up 3.4 percent at $87.00 in premarket trading on Tuesday. The company has been selling off unprofitable brands and focusing on core brands such as Tide, Pampers and Gillette to revive sluggish sales. P&G sold 41 of its brands, including Clairol and Wella, to Coty in a $12.5 billion deal earlier this month. P&G is also reducing costs through a plan to save as much as $10 billion over the next five years, after reducing the same amount in costs over the last five years. The company plans to reinvest a significant portion of those savings in product and packaging improvement, research and development, and expanding sales coverage, P&G's Chief Financial Officer Jon Moeller said on a media call. Net sales remained largely flat at $16.52 billion in the first quarter ended Sept. 30, but beat the average estimate of $16.49 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales in the United Kingdom, P&G's largest European market, fell 2 percent in the quarter, Moeller said. Britain's vote to leave the European Union has caused a plunge in the pound, leading consumer goods makers such as P&G's rival Unilever to attempt to raise prices in the market. Moeller declined to discuss P&G's pricing strategy, but said the U.K. continued to be a "very challenging and highly promotional" market. P&G said net income attributable to the company rose to $2.71 billion, or 96 cents per share, in the quarter, from $2.60 billion, or 91 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, P&G earned $1.03 per share from continuing operations, beating the average analyst estimate of 98 cents. P&G's quarterly sales have been mostly falling for more than three years, as the company has been cutting its brand portfolio. show chapters <p>P&amp;G CFO: Managing &#039;considerable&#039; improvement</p> <p>Jon Moeller, Procter &amp; Gamble CFO, breaks down the company&#039;s quarterly results which beat on the top and bottom line, and provides his outlook on the future as P&amp;G continues innovating new products.</p> P&G CFO: Managing 'considerable' improvement    Tuesday, 25 Oct 2016 | 7:07 AM ET | 03:39 Procter & Gamble's chief financial officer, Jon Moeller, said Tuesday that although the company may be facing headwinds like slowing market growth, its first-quarter earnings report held up regardless. The CFO said that continuous reductions in costs helped Procter & Gamble's above-average organic sales growth in the first quarter. "We grew organic sales 3 percent, on volume growth of 3 percent. We grew in every segment, in 10 out of our 10 categories, in every region, and in 9 of our 10 top markets," Moeller told CNBC's "Squawk Box." Moeller, who is also a member of CNBC's Global CFO Council, said slow market growth can and will be fought through both innovation and active management. As the industry leader in innovation, Procter & Gamble will continue to drive innovation to promote market growth, he said. Moeller also lauded his team's efforts in what he called "the most significant transformation of this company's portfolio in our history," saying he and his colleagues will remain very involved in its management. "We will look to grow both organically and inorganically when the right opportunities present themselves," Moeller said. — CNBC's Elizabeth Gurdus contributed to this report.

Back to BERNAMA.com  | 21 November 2016 Pahlawan Planet Campaign Yields Results By Suriani Razali KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 25 (Bernama) -- Pahlawan Planet, an innovative home-to-school recycling and advocacy campaign initiated by Treat Every Environment Special (TrEES) and Procter & Gamble Malaysia (P&G), has yielded results. The campaign yielded a combined weight of 134,400 kg of recyclables across Kuala Lumpur, Selangor, Putrajaya and Negeri Sembilan, a joint statement said. Thirty-five selected secondary schools out of the initial 53 schools, exceeded the campaign target by reaching out to 22,947 households within two months. The Pahlawan Planet campaign was an integral part of TrEES Young Voices for Conservation 2016, which was approved by the Ministry of Education as a national level co-curriculum programme for secondary schools and supported by the Ministry of Urban Wellbeing, Housing and Local Government. The campaign was designed for secondary school students to educate, cultivate and reinforce a culture of caring for the environment by embracing the 4Rs (Rethink, Reduce, Reuse and Recycle) at home and in school. SAVINGS OF WATER, ENERGY AND OIL The total recyclables collected through the campaign was equivalent to saving 3.24 million litres of water, 569,951 kWH of energy and 205,877 litres of oil. The paper collection of 122,300 kg also saved 2,078 trees that can absorb 13,893 kg of carbon dioxide and produce enough oxygen for 6,235 people each year. "Students who participated have gained skills beyond the classroom and the campaign can be implemented independently by the schools in the future to continue this sustainable lifestyle," said P&G Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei Communications and Government Relations Leader Nadiah Syed Nahar. TrEES Director Leela Panikkar said the 630 student team members from 35 schools motivated 22,947 households to begin reducing and recycling their wastes. "The quality of their work throughout the programme has been outstanding," she added. SMK Agama Putrajaya, which was named the Pahlawan Planet champion walked away with a cash prize of RM3,700. The judges were impressed with the student project team's effort to motivate their community members to recycle and practice the 4Rs as well as their overall commitment to the campaign. TEAMWORK AND POSITIVE ATTITUDE Its principal Othman Hashim attributed its success to teamwork, sound strategies, high proficiencies and positive attitude. "The campaign brought together all the stakeholders including the administrators, teachers, support staff, students and parents." "The students' attitude towards things that are thrown away has also changed; they no longer see waste as something disgusting but as materials that must be recycled, reused, and can even provide opportunities for sources of income. The SMK Agama Putrajaya community is determined to make our success as Pahlawan Planet Champions as the first step towards making our school a 'green school' in the near future," he added. SMK Dengkil took the second spot with RM3,300 while SMK Taman Jasmin 2 was placed third with RM3,000. In addition, three special merit prizes worth RM1,500 each were awarded to SMK King George V, SMK Taman Desa 2 and SMK Cheras Jaya. The total amount paid to the 35 selected schools for the recyclables collected was RM37,497.30. Monies received by the schools will be used to improve their greening efforts and activities within each school. -- BERNAMA Tweet   Tweets by @lifestyle_youth © 2016 BERNAMA. All Rights Reserved.

Most Popular The Lowdown is Ad Age's weekly look at news nuggets from across the world of marketing, including trends, campaign tidbits, executive comings and goings and more. Credit: Rawpixel Ltd/iStock Marketers are a hardworking bunch, averaging 45.9 hours a week on the job, compared with only 45.1 for their non-marketing counterparts. More than half -- 54% -- take less than 30 minutes a day for lunch, with 30% taking only 15 minutes or less. These data come from project management software company Workfront based on an online survey conducted this summer by Regina Corso Consulting among 606 U.S. adults ages 18 and older employed full or part time at companies with 500 or more employees. The report states that "demands on marketers have only increased in the last year. While the vast majority of marketers express an optimistic view of their work life, troubling trends in the number of hours spent at work and the prevalence of inter-team conflict have arisen." Indeed, 98% of respondents reported experiencing conflict with other teams. Not surprisingly, 29% say blocks of uninterrupted time would help them be more productive. All the more reason to just skip that lunch completely. Here's a well-earned customer reward: In just the latest evidence almost anything can happen at Walmart, shopper Cecilia Rivas made national headlines earlier this month when she gave birth in the checkout line at a Payson, Utah, store. She insisted on paying for her merchandise before the blessed event. Less widely noted, the store invited her back a little over a week later for a surprise baby shower, with gifts that included a stroller, a Graco Pack 'n Play pen, and plenty of diapers and wipes. A Walmart employee who interpreted for Ms. Rivas with Salt Lake City's Fox 13 described her as "surprised but happy." Last month MillerCoors told distributors it would launch a low-cal beer called Goldwing in an apparent attempt to take on hot-selling Michelob Ultra. But Goldwing's wings are being clipped before it even has a chance to fly onto shelves in planned test markets in Texas and Louisiana. In a note to distributors this week, MillerCoors said it was putting the test on hold. "We heard a range of feedback on Goldwing. But one point that came through loud and clear is that what we're doing with Coors Light and Miller Lite is working, so now is not the time to shift focus," stated Chief Marketing Officer David Kroll. "So while Goldwing tested very well with drinkers, we're going to hold off and redirect that planned investment behind Coors Light and Miller Lite." Beer Business Daily gave the move a positive review. "It's a Herculean effort in self-restraint, and I think it will serve them well in the long-term," stated editor Harry Schuhmacher. From beer to water: Pur has launched an online and integrated marketing campaign from Arnold Worldwide showing a "Water Bar" featuring tap water from locales nationwide served up to customers. As each is informed about the contaminants -- all at perfectly legal limits -- in the water, such as mercury, chloroform, and lead, they get turned off and leave. The message from the Helen of Troy brand is that "water that meets safe drinking standards may not meet yours." The idea is to steer people to KnowYourWater.com to find out what lurks in their local supply, and get across the point that Pur removes lead and 70 other contaminants. You want content? Here's some content. Procter & Gamble Co. Chief Brand Officer Marc Pritchard has declared something of a war on "crap content" in recent speeches. And that's something this "cleaning dance" video from Pittsburgh Steelers star Antonio Brown for P&G and Rite Aid -- linked to a contest giving away a free trip to Super Bowl LI to a lucky shopper -- clearly is not. The 30-second video can be found on Mr. Brown's Facebook page as well as YouTube. "Dancing while cleaning has long been a universal human behavior," said P&G Brand Manager Eric Rose in a statement. "So we thought it would be fun to reward our most creative shoppers that tackle cleaning in style." The agency behind the effort is Integer, with plans for local TV promotion. Taco Bell's 'Taco Heros' Credit: Taco Bell As Chicago Cubs fans try to forget Tuesday night's 0-6 loss to the Cleveland Indians, Taco Bell gave fans half a reason to celebrate. The Yum Brands chain will give away Doritos Locos tacos after Francisco Lindor of the Indians stole second base during in game one of the World Series. Mr. Lindor is the fifth player to steal a base during the chain's "Steal a Base, Steal a Taco" promotion, which first ran in 2007. He joins Jacoby Ellsbury, Jason Bartlett, Ángel Pagán and Lorenzo Cain in being applauded by the chain as a "Taco Hero." The free tacos, one per person, will be available at participating restaurants from 2-6 p.m. local time on Nov. 2. The offer was mentioned on air during the game on Fox and was promoted by both Taco Bell and Major League Baseball on social media. Blue Bunny is a hit with Cleveland fans. Credit: Courtesy of Blue Bunny Meanwhile, ice cream brand Blue Bunny got in on the giveaway game in its own way Tuesday. With the World Series starting in Cleveland right near the Cleveland Cavaliers making their season debut and commemorating last season's championship, there was plenty for sports fans to celebrate. LeBron James joked days earlier that having an ice cream truck outside of the two arenas would make the night even better. So Blue Bunny sent a truck of ice cream to Cleveland and handed out treats to fans in the area between Progressive Field and the Quicken Loans Arena. Olson Engage was the agency on the project.

Multimedia Today's Paper Topics ePaper WealthCheck SEARCH Follow Home News Markets Companies Money & Banking Economy Info-tech Opinion Specials Portfolio Catalyst BLink Stocks Forex Commodities Gold & Silver Today's Pick Portfolio Tracker US stocks slip from 2-week highs Reuters   ·   print   ·   T+  ·   T- Tweet New York, Oct 26:   US stocks slipped from two-week highs on Tuesday as results and forecasts from companies in sectors, including housing and consumer products, failed to live up to expectations. Apple, the largest US company by market capitalisation, posted after the bell better-than-expected iPhone sales that however continued a declining trend and shares fell about 2 per cent, briefly dragging S&P 500 futures to session lows. During the regular session, Whirlpool, down 10.8 per cent to $152.09, cited soft demand as it posted lower-than-expected earnings and gave an underwhelming forecast. Sherwin Williams' outlook also disappointed Wall Street and shares fell 10.9 per cent to $247.61. Both were an indication to some analysts that the housing sector may be cooling. “Lacklustrr results from Whirlpool and Sherwin Williams may indicate a slowing in the housing cycle,” said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. She said those results could be weighing on Home Depot , which was down 3.5 per cent at $123.34 as the largest points decliner on the S&P 500. Lowes Cos fell 3.5 per cent to $68.47. Consumer products company Procter & Gamble rose 3.4 per cent to $86.97 after reporting a better-than-expected quarterly profit, while sportswear maker Under Armour fell 13.2 per cent to $32.89 after it reported its slowest quarterly sales growth in six years. “We had a rally (Monday) and haven’t been able to sustain it, due to weaker-than-expected numbers from some names,” said Peter Jankovskis, co-chief investment officer at OakBrook Investments in Lisle, Illinois, calling the day's earnings a "mixed bag.” Overall, annualised third-quarter earnings from S&P 500 companies are expected to have risen 1.7 per cent, effectively putting an end to an earnings recession, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Of the 150 companies that have reported so far, 75.3 per cent have beaten analyst expectations, above the long-term average of 63.5 per cent. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 53.76 points, or 0.3 per cent, to 18,169.27, the S&P 500 lost 8.17 points, or 0.38 per cent, to 2,143.16 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 26.43 points, or 0.5 per cent, to 5,283.40. Futures were also pressured after the bell by a late decline in oil prices after data showed a bigger-than-expected build in US crude inventories. 3M fell 2.9 per cent to $166.23 after the maker of Scotch tape and Post-it notes trimmed its full-year revenue and earnings forecasts for the second time. Caterpillar lost 1.8 per cent after a downbeat forecast, while General Motors fell 4.2 percent amid fears regarding future profits. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.53-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.17-to-1 ratio favoured decliners. The S&P 500 posted 11 new 52-week highs and nine new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 67 new highs and 73 new lows. About 6.39 billion shares changed hands in US exchanges, in line with the 6.4 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

Like this story, share it with millions of investors on M3 Wall Street slips on earnings; Apple falls late after results Apple , the largest US company by market capitalization, posted after the bell better-than-expected iPhone sales that however continued a declining trend and shares fell about 2 percent, briefly dragging S&P 500 futures to session lows. Post Your Comments Share Cancel US stocks slipped from two-week highs on Tuesday as results and forecasts from companies in sectors including housing and consumer products failed to live up to expectations. Apple, the largest US company by market capitalization, posted after the bell better-than-expected iPhone sales that however continued a declining trend and shares fell about 2 percent, briefly dragging S&P 500 futures to session lows. During the regular session, Whirlpool , down 10.8 percent to USD 152.09, cited soft demand as it posted lower-than-expected earnings and gave an underwhelming forecast. Sherwin Williams' outlook also disappointed Wall Street and shares fell 10.9 percent to USD 247.61. Both were an indication to some analysts that the housing sector may be cooling. "Lackluster results from Whirlpool and Sherwin Williams may indicate a slowing in the housing cycle," said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. She said those results could be weighing on Home Depot , which was down 3.5 percent at USD 123.34 as the largest points decliner on the S&P 500. Lowes Cos fell 3.5 percent to USD 68.47. Consumer products company Procter & Gamble rose 3.4 percent to USD 86.97 after reporting a better-than-expected quarterly profit, while sportswear maker Under Armour fell 13.2 percent to USD 32.89 after it reported its slowest quarterly sales growth in six years. “We had a rally (Monday) and haven’t been able to sustain it, due to weaker-than-expected numbers from some names,” said Peter Jankovskis, co-chief investment officer at OakBrook Investments in Lisle, Illinois, calling the day’s earnings a "mixed bag." Overall, annualized third-quarter earnings from S&P 500 companies are expected to have risen 1.7 percent, effectively putting an end to an earnings recession, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Of the 150 companies that have reported so far, 75.3 percent have beaten analyst expectations, above the long-term average of 63.5 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 53.76 points, or 0.3 percent, to 18,169.27, the S&P 500 lost 8.17 points, or 0.38 percent, to 2,143.16 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 26.43 points, or 0.5 percent, to 5,283.40. Futures were also pressured after the bell by a late decline in oil prices after data showed a bigger-than-expected build in US crude inventories. 3M fell 2.9 percent to USD 166.23 after the maker of Scotch tape and Post-it notes trimmed its full-year revenue and earnings forecasts for the second time. Caterpillar lost 1.8 percent after a downbeat forecast, while General Motors fell 4.2 percent amid fears regarding future profits. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.53-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.17-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 11 new 52-week highs and nine new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 67 new highs and 73 new lows. About 6.39 billion shares changed hands in US exchanges, in line with the 6.4 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

Third-quarter earnings continued to dominate the market and some of the biggest companies either reported disappointing results or lowered their expectations. Investors wondered if consumers will spend less money on home improvement, clothing and other goods. But companies including Procter & Gamble and Lockheed Martin soared after their reports. Looking for safer options, some investors bought bonds and utility company shares. Consumer spending is critical to the U.S. economy and poor results for consumer-focused companies could be a sign of trouble. But Doug Roman, managing director of equities for PNC Capital Advisors, said it's too soon to know if shoppers are closing their wallets. "The market might be extrapolating bigger stories into broader themes, which might not be the case," he said. Corporate earnings have been falling for more than a year, and despite Tuesday's results, investors are growing hopeful that streak is ending. The Dow Jones industrial average shed 53.76 points, or 0.3 percent, to 18,169.27. The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 8.17 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,143.16. The Nasdaq composite fell 26.43 points, or 0.5 percent, to 5,283.40. Paint and coatings maker Sherwin-Williams posted a disappointing profit and cut its annual guidance because of slower sales growth combined with spending on new stores. Meanwhile appliance maker Whirlpool's results fell far short of analyst projections. Sherwin-Williams had its worst day in seven years as it lost $30.27, or 10.9 percent, to $247.61. Whirlpool, which owns Maytag and KitchenAid, sank $18.37, or 10.8 percent, to $152.09, its largest loss in five years. Home improvement retailers Home Depot and Lowe's and flooring maker Mohawk Industries all slumped. So did automaker General Motors, which reported solid earnings. Under Armour reported its slowest sales growth in six years and said its future sales won't be as strong as it expected a year ago. Its stock tumbled $5.01, or 13.2 percent, to $32.89, its biggest drop in almost eight years. Rival Nike also slipped. Procter & Gamble, which makes Tide detergent and Charmin toilet paper, had its best day in more than a year after it reported better results than investors expected. The consumer products giant has been selling some businesses to cut costs, and it posted stronger sales of personal care products like toothbrushes and deodorants. Its stock rose $2.87, or 3.4 percent, to $86.97.

(AAPL) iPhone Sales Fall Mixed results on the earnings front kept stocks down Tuesday Oct 25, 2016, 5:38 pm EST  |  By Anthony Mirhaydari, InvestorPlace Market Strategist     U.S. stocks finished lower on Tuesday as third-quarter earnings remain in focus. In the end, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.2%, the S&P 500 Index lost 0.4%, the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.5% and the Russell 2000 finished 0.8% lower. Treasury bonds were mixed, the dollar was unable to hold early strength, gold gained 0.8% and the price of crude was lower down 1.1% on growing doubts about an OPEC-Russia supply freeze deal. Crude was also hit by a surprise inventory build, with API stockpiles up 4.8 million barrels in the largest increase since April. Defensive utility and consumer staples stocks led the way with gains of 0.5% and 0.3% respectively. Consumer discretionary and materials stocks were the laggards, down 1.2% and 1%, respectively. What Stocks Will Win the 2016 Election? Regional bank KeyCorp (NYSE:KEY) surged 6% thanks to a Q3 earnings-per-share beat on solid net interest income and loan growth. Procter & Gamble Co (NYSE:PG) gained on a Q3 earnings beat driven by 3% organic sales growth versus the 2.4% expected. On the downside, Under Armour Inc (NYSE:UA) lost 13.2% despite better-than-expected earnings and revenues as gross margins disappointed and management comments that its growth rate going forward will slow. Whirlpool Corporation (NYSE:WHR) dropped 10.8% on a 5% earning miss on weak sales driven by soft demand. After the close, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) lost 1.7% — in contrast to the torrid rally in the stock over the last three months for a 20% gain — after reporting tepid results. Revenues dropped 9% from last year to $46.9 billion with 45.5 million iPhones sold (down 5% from last year but slightly ahead of expectations). Earnings of $9 billion was a whopping 19% decline from last year. China sales were down 30% from last year. The results will further fuel worries that the smartphone market is now mature and saturated, that the iPhone 7 is getting a lukewarm response, and that the company is facing serious headwinds in China. Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Just Failed Its Q4 Earnings Test Going forward, keep eye on crude oil as it looks ready for a fresh bout of weakness here as West Texas Intermediate drops back below the $50-a-barrel threshold and threatens a decline below its 20-day moving average for the first time since late September. The November U.S. Oil Fund LP ETF (NYSEARCA:USO) puts recommended today to Edge Pro subscribers are already up 20%.

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Wednesday, 26 October 2016 | MYT 6:42 AM Wall Street slips on earnings; Apple falls late after results The Dow Jones industrial average fell 53.76 points, or 0.3 percent, to 18,169.27, the S&P 500 lost 8.17 points, or 0.38 percent, to 2,143.16 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 26.43 points, or 0.5 percent, to 5,283.40. Futures were also pressured after the bell by a late decline in oil prices after data showed a bigger-than-expected build in U.S. crude inventories. NEW YORK: U.S. stocks slipped from two-week highs on Tuesday as results and forecasts from companies in sectors including housing and consumer products failed to live up to expectations. Apple <AAPL.O>, the largest U.S. company by market capitalization, posted after the bell better-than-expected iPhone sales that however continued a declining trend and shares fell about 2 percent, briefly dragging S&P 500 futures <ESc1> to session lows. During the regular session, Whirlpool <WHR.N>, down 10.8 percent to $152.09, cited soft demand as it posted lower-than-expected earnings and gave an underwhelming forecast. Sherwin Williams' <SHW.N> outlook also disappointed Wall Street and shares fell 10.9 percent to $247.61. Both were an indication to some analysts that the housing sector may be cooling. "Lackluster results from Whirlpool and Sherwin Williams may indicate a slowing in the housing cycle," said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. She said those results could be weighing on Home Depot <HD.N>, which was down 3.5 percent at $123.34 as the largest points decliner on the S&P 500. Lowes Cos <LOW.N> fell 3.5 percent to $68.47. Consumer products company Procter & Gamble <PG.N> rose 3.4 percent to $86.97 after reporting a better-than-expected quarterly profit, while sportswear maker Under Armour <UA.N> fell 13.2 percent to $32.89 after it reported its slowest quarterly sales growth in six years. “We had a rally (Monday) and haven’t been able to sustain it, due to weaker-than-expected numbers from some names,” said Peter Jankovskis, co-chief investment officer at OakBrook Investments in Lisle, Illinois, calling the day’s earnings a "mixed bag." Overall, annualized third-quarter earnings from S&P 500 companies are expected to have risen 1.7 percent, effectively putting an end to an earnings recession, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Of the 150 companies that have reported so far, 75.3 percent have beaten analyst expectations, above the long-term average of 63.5 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 53.76 points, or 0.3 percent, to 18,169.27, the S&P 500 lost 8.17 points, or 0.38 percent, to 2,143.16 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 26.43 points, or 0.5 percent, to 5,283.40. Futures were also pressured after the bell by a late decline in oil prices after data showed a bigger-than-expected build in U.S. crude inventories. 3M <MMM.N> fell 2.9 percent to $166.23 after the maker of Scotch tape and Post-it notes trimmed its full-year revenue and earnings forecasts for the second time. Caterpillar <CAT.N> lost 1.8 percent after a downbeat forecast, while General Motors <GM.N> fell 4.2 percent amid fears regarding future profits. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.53-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.17-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

"To me, once again, the exceedingly profitable revenue stream is the one to watch, and it is still being relatively ignored, despite its 24 percent growth to $6.3 billion, and despite the naysayers' comments," the "Mad Money" host said. After reviewing the quarter, Cramer gave his usual mantra to own Apple, don't trade it. Apple's stock jumped far in advance of earnings, partially because of Samsung's issue with the Galaxy Note 7 phone that left room for Apple to take share in the industry. While Apple's revenue came in line with estimates and earnings beat analyst expectations with better than expected iPhone sales, it was the third straight quarter with a year-over-year decline in revenue. Last year, comparable sales were $51.5 billion, versus $46.9 billion this quarter. Shares fell more than 2 percent in after-hours trading in response. Apple's stock still juicy? Mark Neuling | CNBC Apple iPhone 7 Outside of Apple and Samsung, Cramer saw many more examples of companies excelling versus the competition because they are doing so well with the hand they have been dealt. Procter and Gamble became a house of brands that at one point seemed stalled to Cramer. Some investors considered the stock nothing more than a bond market equivalent with a 3 percent yield. That all changed on Tuesday when Procter & Gamble blew away the numbers, posting 3 percent organic growth. Cramer considered that impressive considering the size of the company. United Technologies boosted its earnings guidance after reporting a terrific quarter. Yet, in contrast, General Electric brought its forecast down. "I think a case can be made that United Technologies is simply out-executing GE in more than just aerospace," Cramer said. It all came down to execution for Cramer, especially in a busy earnings season that is notorious for turmoil. For those investors who do their own stock picking, Cramer reminded them to remember the effect of strong management, and to avoid battleground stocks, like Under Armour in the sports apparel space. "At least until the smoke clears and the stocks have fallen so far that I will tell you when the time is right to pounce," Cramer said. Correction: This story has been updated to show that Apple reported revenue of $46.9 billion. Questions for Cramer? Call Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBC Want to take a deep dive into Cramer's world?

Apple, the largest U.S. company by market capitalization, posted after the bell better-than-expected iPhone sales that however continued a declining trend and shares fell about 2 percent, briefly dragging S&P 500 futures to session lows. During the regular session, Whirlpool, down 10.8 percent to $152.09, cited soft demand as it posted lower-than-expected earnings and gave an underwhelming forecast. Sherwin Williams' outlook also disappointed Wall Street and shares fell 10.9 percent to $247.61. Both were an indication to some analysts that the housing sector may be cooling. "Lackluster results from Whirlpool and Sherwin Williams may indicate a slowing in the housing cycle," said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. She said those results could be weighing on Home Depot , which was down 3.5 percent at $123.34 as the largest points decliner on the S&P 500. Lowes Cos fell 3.5 percent to $68.47. Consumer products company Procter & Gamble rose 3.4 percent to $86.97 after reporting a better-than-expected quarterly profit, while sportswear maker Under Armour fell 13.2 percent to $32.89 after it reported its slowest quarterly sales growth in six years. "We had a rally (Monday) and haven't been able to sustain it, due to weaker-than-expected numbers from some names," said Peter Jankovskis, co-chief investment officer at OakBrook Investments in Lisle, Illinois, calling the day's earnings a "mixed bag." Overall, annualized third-quarter earnings from S&P 500 companies are expected to have risen 1.7 percent, effectively putting an end to an earnings recession, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Of the 150 companies that have reported so far, 75.3 percent have beaten analyst expectations, above the long-term average of 63.5 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 53.76 points, or 0.3 percent, to 18,169.27, the S&P 500 lost 8.17 points, or 0.38 percent, to 2,143.16 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 26.43 points, or 0.5 percent, to 5,283.40. Futures were also pressured after the bell by a late decline in oil prices after data showed a bigger-than-expected build in U.S. crude inventories. 3M fell 2.9 percent to $166.23 after the maker of Scotch tape and Post-it notes trimmed its full-year revenue and earnings forecasts for the second time. Caterpillar lost 1.8 percent after a downbeat forecast, while General Motors fell 4.2 percent amid fears regarding future profits. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.53-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.17-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 11 new 52-week highs and nine new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 67 new highs and 73 new lows. About 6.39 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, in line with the 6.4 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

Also hurting sentiment was a report showing US consumer confidence weakened more than expected. And oil fell. "We've had some mixed earnings today and the market right now is digesting earnings and positioning itself ahead of the Fed[eral Reserve] meeting next week," Jeff Zipper, managing director for investments at Private Client Reserve at US Bank in Palm Beach, Florida, told Reuters. In 2.10pm trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.2 percent, while the Nasdaq Composite Index slid 0.4 percent. In 1.54pm trading, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index declined 0.2 percent. The Dow moved lower as declines in shares of 3M and those of Home Depot, recently down 2.9 percent and 2.8 percent respectively, outweighed gains in shares of Procter & Gamble and those of United Technologies, recently trading 4.1 percent and 2.4 percent higher respectively. 3M lowered its outlook for 2016 sales and earnings. Shares of Caterpillar slid, down 2.2 percent recently, after the world’s No. 1 maker of mining and construction equipment, downgraded its full-year sales and profit outlook because of a “challenged environment.” The company now expects sales of US$39 billion, down from a previous estimate for between US$40 billion and US$40.5 billion, it said in a statement. Caterpillar said its expects 2017 sales and revenues "will not be significantly different than 2016.” “While we are seeing early signals of improvement in some areas, we continue to face a number of challenges,” CEO Doug Oberhelman said in the statement. Shares of Whirlpool sank, down 12.1 percent as of 2.06pm in New York, after the company downgraded its full-year profit outlook. Apple edged higher ahead of the release of its fiscal fourth quarter results after the closing bell. While the iPhone maker is forecast to report lower annual sales, the decline may prove less than some analysts have been expecting in part because of rival Samsung’s recent struggles. Meanwhile, a Conference Board report showed its index of consumer confidence dropped to 98.6 in October from 103.5 in September. To be sure, Procter & Gamble and United Technologies were among companies reporting better-than-expected results. “We’re getting some good earnings, but it’s still been a fairly mixed picture,” Matt Maley, an equity strategist at Miller Tabak & Co in New York, told Bloomberg. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index finished the session with a 0.4 percent drop from the previous close amid disappointing results from drugmaker Novartis. Germany’s DAX Index inched 0.04 percent lower, while France’s CAC 40 Index fell 0.3 percent. Bucking the trend, the UK’s FTSE 100 Index rose 0.5 percent.

Selling pressure remained relatively subdued, however, limiting the downside for the markets. The major average ended the day firmly in the red. The Dow fell 8.16 points or 0.4 percent to 2,143.15, the Nasdaq slid 26.43 points or 0.5 percent to 5,283.40 and the S&P 500 dropped 53.76 points or 0.3 percent to 18,169.27. The weakness on Wall Street came as traders reacted to the latest batch of earnings news, with a number of big-name companies releasing their quarterly results. Shares of Sonic (SONC) fell sharply on the day after the fast food chain reported better than expected fiscal fourth quarter earnings but provided disappointing guidance. Sportswear maker Under Amour (UA) also came under pressure after the company said its growth rate going forward will be less than expected. On the other hand, shares of Procter & Gamble (PG) showed a strong move to the upside after the consumer products giant reported fiscal first quarter results that exceeded analyst estimates. 3M (MMM), Caterpillar (CAT), and DuPont (DD) are among the other well known companies that released their quarterly results on the day, while tech giant Apple (AAPL) is due to release its results after the close. In economic news, the Conference Board released a report showing a bigger than expected drop in consumer confidence in the month of October. The Conference Board said its consumer confidence index fell to 98.6 in October after climbing to 103.5 in September. Economists had expected the index to drop to 101.0. "Consumers' assessment of current business and employment conditions softened, while optimism regarding the short-term outlook retreated somewhat," said Lynn Franco, Director of Economic Indicators at the Conference Board. She added, "Overall, sentiment is that the economy will continue to expand in the near-term, but at a moderate pace." Sector News Housing stocks showed a significant move to the downside on the day, dragging the Philadelphia Housing Sector Index down by 2.3 percent. With the drop, the index fell to its lowest closing level in nearly four months. Masco (MAS) led the housing sector lower, with the cabinetry manufacturer slumping by 9.5 percent after reporting weaker than expected third quarter results. Considerable weakness was also visible among natural gas stocks, as reflected by the 1.9 percent drop by the NYSE Arca Natural Gas Index. Biotechnology, consumer, and oil service stocks also saw notable weakness. Meanwhile, gold stocks moved sharply higher as the day has progressed, driving the NYSE Arca Gold Bugs Index up by 2.5 percent. The strength among gold stocks came as gold for December delivery climbed $9.90 to $1,273.60 an ounce. Other Markets In overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region turned in a mixed performance during trading on Tuesday. Japan's Nikkei 225 Index advanced by 0.8 percent, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index edged down by 0.2 percent. The major European markets also ended the day mixed. While the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index rose by 0.5 percent, the German DAX Index closed just below the unchanged line and the French CAC 40 Index fell by 0.3 percent. In the bond market, treasuries showed a lack of direction over the course of the session before closing roughly flat. Subsequently, the yield on the benchmark ten-year note, which moves opposite of its price, dipped by less than a basis point to 1.758 percent.

However strong results for household goods maker Procter & Gamble are sending its stock higher. KEEPING SCORE: The Dow Jones industrial average shed 52 points, or 0.3 percent, to 18,171 as of 3:40 p.m. Eastern time. The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 8 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,143. The Nasdaq composite fell 29 points, or 0.5 percent, to 5,280. BAD FIT: Under Armour reported its slowest sales growth in six years and said its future sales won't be as strong as it expected a year ago. Its stock tumbled $5.02, or 13.2 percent, to $32.88 and is headed for its biggest loss since 2009. Under Armour traded above $50 a share a little more than a year ago. PAINT IT BLACK: Paint and coatings maker Sherwin-Williams posted a profit that was smaller than expected.

FOCUS: Procter & Gamble, the company that makes Tide detergent and Charmin toilet paper, is on track for its best day in a year after it reported better results than investors expected.

The maker of Maytag and KitchenAid products sank $19.19, or 11.3 percent, to $151.27. THE QUOTE: Consumer spending is critical to the U.S. economy, so poor results for consumer-focused companies could be a sign of trouble. But Doug Roman, managing director of equities for PNC Capital Advisors, said it's too soon to know if consumers are closing their wallets. "The market might be extrapolating bigger stories into broader themes, which might not be the case," he said. A GUSHER: Oil and gas drilling services company Baker Hughes disclosed a smaller loss than investors expected. Investors were also pleased that Baker Hughes is preparing to cut more costs. The company said it plans to eliminate $650 million in spending this year, up from the $500 million it had planned to cut. It climbed $2.34, or 4.5 percent, to $54.49.

Its stock gained $17.25, or 7.4 percent, to $249.41, its biggest leap in seven years. TAP THE BRAKES: General Motors had a strong quarter but investors sent its stock down $1.40, or 4.2 percent, to $31.58.

MERCK MAKES MORE: Drugmaker Merck raised its forecasts after it reported a bigger profit on greater sales of vaccines and cancer medicines. The company has also been trying to keep is spending in check. The stock rose $1.23, or 2 percent, to $61.98. 3M GETS STUCK: 3M, which makes Post-it notes, industrial coatings and ceramics, forecast weaker sales growth and a smaller profit for the year.

Its stock gained $2.28, or 2.3 percent, to $101.80.

Posted 26 Oct 2016 04:29 Updated 26 Oct 2016 04:39 Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. (AP Photo/Richard Drew) Enlarge Caption  Email More A A NEW YORK: Wall Street stocks dropped modestly on Tuesday (Oct 25) as investors adopted a cautious view after a deluge of earnings results that included both positive and negative surprises. "We're seeing an overall positive tone to earnings but we have seen some ... potential signs of caution, so investors are waiting to gather the complete picture," said David Levy, portfolio manager at Republic Wealth Advisors. Big winners included the defence giant Lockheed Martin, up 7.5 per cent, and consumer products giant Procter & Gamble, which gained 3.4 per cent after reporting strong gains in organic sales. On the flip side, shares of paint company Sherwin-Williams and home-appliance make Whirlpool suffered double-digit percentage declines after disappointing results. That prompted concerns that consumer investment in homes is slowing, pushing shares of Home Depot and Lowe's down more than three per cent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 53.76 points (0.30 per cent) to 18,169.27. The broad-based S&P 500 shed 8.17 points (0.38 per cent) to 2,143.16, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index lost 26.43 points (0.50 per cent) to 5,283.40. Caterpillar finished down 1.8 following a volatile session after reporting that third-quarter net profits sank nearly 50 per cent year-on-year to US$283 million. The heavy equipment maker said it was encouraged that commodities prices have risen somewhat, but that it had yet to see a pickup in business. General Motors dropped 4.3 per cent after reporting that net profit in the third quarter roughly doubled to a better-than-expected US$2.8 billion due largely to lower costs on recalls compared with the year-ago. The automaker warned that its goal of breaking even in Europe could be stymied by fallout from Britain's vote to pull out of the European Union. Athletic shoe and apparel maker Under Armour slumped 13.1 per cent after it warned that it would miss its 2018 operating profit target due to higher expenses as it expands into new markets. - AFP/de Email More YOU MAY ALSO LIKE From Our Website From the Web Happening Now new window view more My Facebook Friends Back To Top JUMP TO Select Section Asia Pacific Singapore World Business Sport Entertainment Technology Health Lifestyle Videos Weather Photos Special Reports Archives Services PSI Navigate to: News TV Watch Live GET OUR APPS iPhone/iPad Android Get Our News Facebook Twitter Linkedin YouTube Mobile SMS eNews RSS News Asia Pacific World Sport Technology Lifestyle Photos Archives Singapore Business Entertainment Health Videos Special Reports TV Live News Schedule Shows Services Weather ADVERTISE WITH US Online Mobile TV Contact Sales Channel NewsAsia Channel News Asia About Us Coverage Hotel Partners Events & Seminars Presenters & Correspondents Contact Us Mediacorp Mediacorp News Group © 2016 About Mediacorp Pte Ltd Terms and Conditions Privacy Policy Back To Top
  Home U.K. News Sports U.S. Showbiz Australia Femail Health Science Money Video Travel Columnists Wires Home My Profile Logout Login Feedback DailyMail NEW ARTICLESHomeTop Share show ad US STOCKS-Wall St slips on earnings; Apple results due By Reuters Published: 16:14 EST, 25 October 2016 | Updated: 16:14 EST, 25 October 2016 e-mail By Rodrigo Campos NEW YORK, Oct 25 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks slipped from two-week highs on Tuesday as results and forecasts from companies in sectors, including housing and consumer products, failed to live up to expectations. Apple, the largest U.S. company by market capitalization, was expected to report results after the closing bell. Whirlpool, down 10.8 percent to $152.09, cited soft demand as it posted lower-than-expected earnings and gave an underwhelming forecast. Sherwin Williams' outlook also disappointed Wall Street and shares fell 10.9 percent to $247.61. Both were an indication to some analysts that the housing sector may be cooling. "Lackluster results from Whirlpool and Sherwin Williams may indicate a slowing in the housing cycle," said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. She said those results could be weighing on Home Depot , which was down 3.5 percent at $123.34 as the largest points decliner on the S&P 500. Lowes Cos fell 3.5 percent to $68.47. Consumer products company Procter & Gamble rose 3.4 percent to $86.97 after reporting a better-than-expected quarterly profit, while sportswear maker Under Armour fell 13.2 percent to $32.89 after it reported its slowest quarterly sales growth in six years. "We had a rally (Monday) and haven't been able to sustain it, due to weaker than expected numbers from some names," said Peter Jankovskis, co-chief investment officer at OakBrook Investments in Lisle, Illinois, calling the day's earnings a "mixed bag." Overall, annualized third-quarter earnings from S&P 500 companies are expected to have risen 1.7 percent, effectively putting an end to an earnings recession, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Of the 150 companies that have reported so far, 75.3 percent have beaten analyst expectations, above the long-term average of 63.5 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 53.76 points, or 0.3 percent, to 18,169.27, the S&P 500 lost 8.17 points, or 0.38 percent, to 2,143.16 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 26.43 points, or 0.5 percent, to 5,283.40. 3M fell 2.9 percent to $166.23 after the maker of Scotch tape and Post-it notes trimmed its full-year revenue and earnings forecasts for the second time. Caterpillar lost 1.8 percent after a downbeat forecast, while General Motors fell 4.2 percent amid fears regarding future profits. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.53-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.17-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 11 new 52-week highs and 9 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 67 new highs and 73 new lows. About 6.29 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, compared with the 6.4 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

It all looks like an effort to conduct a grand, Harvard Business Review-worthy experiment on Canada. Finance Minister Bill Morneau, right, looks on as Dominic Barton, chairman of the Advisory Council on Economic Growth, responds to questions during a news conference in Ottawa on Oct. 20, 2016.  (Adrian Wyld / THE CANADIAN PRESS)   By Jennifer WellsBusiness Columnist Tues., Oct. 25, 2016 The devil is in the footnotes. How do we know that infrastructure drives economic productivity “year after year to the tune of 20 to 50 cents on every original dollar invested”? See footnote one: McKinsey Global Institute and the International Monetary Fund. How do we know that for every $1 million invested, “approximately 15 jobs are created”? See footnote two: McKinsey Global Institute. Article Continued Below How do we know that “best practices” in infrastructure development can result in savings in the “range of 23 per cent”? See footnote 14: McKinsey Global Institute. At the risk of regurgitating prior columns on the strategic initiative known as the Advisory Council on Economic Growth, let’s allow that dollar-a-year man Dominic Barton has spent years on the hustings selling global audiences on McKinsey data and McKinsey big think. Now we have the McKinsey Plan to open the spigot on international funds seeking a revenue-spinning home via investment in Canadian infrastructure while burnishing our reputation as a place for foreign direct investment like, say, Singapore. (Barton once lauded Singapore as the best for one-stop FDI investment. “Their economic development board is like a Procter & Gamble for capital,” he once said. He was at the time, and remains, a member of the board’s International Advisory Council.) Thus Canada is becoming a Petri dish for a grand experiment, a sort of McKinsey global case study that will surely make its way one day into the Harvard Business Review. As part of the grand experiment Finance Minister Bill Morneau is being asked to green light a Canadian Infrastructure Development Bank (CIDB), which sounds like a moniker sprung from the ’60s. (The word “sprung” may trigger PTSD for some economists who recall the east coast vegetable boondoggle.) So Minister Morneau might think first about carefully naming this “once-in-a-generation” opportunity, as defined by the council’s “Path to Prosperity” outline released last week. (It’s feather light, so let’s not call it a “report.”) As sketched, the “bank” would not only assess revenue-generating infrastructure proposals with project costs in excess of $100 million, but could offer “optional advice” as to the procurement and execution of social fabric projects where there is no revenue potential. This dual-class structure seems out of step with the Trudeau government, which has pledged to prioritize, by example, the infrastructure needs of indigenous communities. The risk here is that the CIDB will emerge as an archaic-sounding institution with a “highly independent board of governors and a CEO with world-class, relevant business experience.” (That an independent board of governors needs to be defined as “highly independent” brings to mind the toady director archetype, still a common creature in the Canadian corporate landscape.) And yet, the bones are there. A “national centre of excellence in infrastructure” with transparent performance measures calls to mind Infrastructure Australia, which regularly releases a countrywide priority list. Its Oct. 7 release, by example, itemizes proposed corridor upgrades, airport links, rail improvements etc. by location, timeline and problem category (urban congestion, national connectivity). Remote infrastructure and opportunity for growth are two defined problem categories. And so we see near-term plans for the delivery of infrastructure and essential services to remote communities, improved agricultural water supply in Tasmania and water supply security in Darwin and relocating a STEM research facility to Hobart. Note: as part of its “listening tour” in advance of drafting its first communiqué, the Advisory Council on Economic Growth held two workshops with First Nations communities. Two. That’s just embarrassing. There’s still time for Finance Minister Morneau to walk back some of the McKinsey think, and define instead a more encompassing, holistic Centre for Canadian Infrastructure Excellence. A centre that will not speak first to corporate interests and return on investment, but equally to the needs of one Canada. In numerous speeches, Dominic Barton has made reference to a comment made to him by the late Jim Flaherty. It goes something like this: “I wish I learnt at the beginning to put a microscope in one eye and a telescope in the other and not get a headache.” I wonder if he has ever shared the same anecdote with Bill Morneau. jenwells@thestar.ca The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.

Asian shares hit by gloom on Wall Street, lower oil prices Associated Press | TOKYO (AP) — Shares fell broadly in Asia on Wednesday after a gloomy session on Wall Street, where shares of household names like appliance maker Whirlpool and athletic apparel maker Under Armour suffered their worst declines in years. Weaker oil prices also cast a pall. KEEPING SCORE: Japan's Nikkei 225 wavered into a modest gain by midday, adding 0.1 percent to 17,379.25, but most other regional benchmarks fell. Hong Kong's Hang Seng dropped 0.7 percent to 23,403.44 and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 dropped 1.5 percent to 5,359.40. South Korea's Kospi lost 1.5 percent to 2,007.38 and India's Sensex lost 0.7 percent to 27,895.12. Markets in Southeast Asia and Taiwan also fell. WALL STREET BLUES: Disappointing third-quarter earnings from big name companies raised worries over consumer spending, a critical driver of U.S. growth. Sherwin-Williams had its worst day in seven years, losing 10.9 percent, while Whirlpool plunged 10.8 percent. Athletic wear maker Under Armour's shares sank 13.2 percent, its biggest drop in almost eight years. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.3 percent to 18,169.27, the Standard & Poor's 500 index gave up 0.4 percent to 2,143.16 and the Nasdaq composite shed 0.5 percent, to 5,283.40. ANALYST VIEWPOINT: "U.S. equities turned lower overnight as the U.S. Consumer Confidence Index printed well below market expectations," Illka Gobius of OANDA said in a commentary. "We could see further pressure on equity markets because oil prices plunged in late N.Y. trade" after the American Petroleum Institute reported a much larger than expected buildup in U.S. crude inventories. APPLE EARNINGS: After U.S. markets closed, Apple reported lower quarterly sales, another dispiriting factor given the many Asian manufacturers that are suppliers for the iPhone and other Apple products. "Apple's numbers after-market look quite uninspiring and we are seeing shares down 2.5 percent in after-hours trade," Chris Weston of IG said in a research note. OIL PRICES: Benchmark U.S. crude fell 65 cents to $49.31 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It lost 56 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $49.96 per barrel on Tuesday. Brent crude, the international standard, dropped 58 cents to $50.21 a barrel. It fell 67 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $50.79 a barrel in London. CURRENCIES: The dollar rose to 104.35 yen from 104.12 yen. The euro rose to $1.0890 from $1.0879. ___ AP Markets Writer Marley Jay contributed to this report.

Photo / AP Stocks on both sides of the Atlantic slid amid disappointing results from companies including 3M and Caterpillar. Also hurting sentiment was a report showing US consumer confidence weakened more than expected. And oil fell. "We've had some mixed earnings today and the market right now is digesting earnings and positioning itself ahead of the Fed[eral Reserve] meeting next week," Jeff Zipper, managing director for investments at Private Client Reserve at US Bank in Palm Beach, Florida, told Reuters. In 2.10pm trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.2 per cent, while the Nasdaq Composite Index slid 0.4 per cent. In 1.54pm trading, the Standard & Poor's 500 Index declined 0.2 per cent. The Dow moved lower as declines in shares of 3M and those of Home Depot, recently down 2.9 per cent and 2.8 per cent respectively, outweighed gains in shares of Procter & Gamble and those of United Technologies, recently trading 4.1 per cent and 2.4 per cent higher respectively. 3M lowered its outlook for 2016 sales and earnings. Shares of Caterpillar slid, down 2.2 per cent recently, after the world's No. 1 maker of mining and construction equipment, downgraded its full-year sales and profit outlook because of a "challenged environment." The company now expects sales of US$39 billion, down from a previous estimate for between US$40 billion and US$40.5 billion, it said in a statement.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermidMore By Hilary Russ NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell on disappointing earnings reports on Tuesday, while the U.S. dollar slipped from multi-month highs after Bank of England Governor Mark Carney cast doubt on expectations for more monetary stimulus. Oil prices fell more than 1 percent, with U.S. crude breaking below $50 per barrel for a second straight day, ahead of weekly data that could show a build in inventories. On Wall Street, nine of the eleven sectors in the benchmark S&P 500 stock index closed lower, with housing and consumer products companies among those failing to live up to forecasts on third-quarter earnings. Shares of some big names, including Whirlpool , General Motors Co , Caterpillar Inc and 3M , all lost ground. "We had a rally (Monday) and haven't been able to sustain it, due to weaker-than-expected numbers from some names," said Peter Jankovskis, co-chief investment officer at OakBrook Investments in Lisle, Illinois. He called the day's earnings report a "mixed bag" for stocks. Another third of the S&P 500 is scheduled to report earnings this week, including heavyweights Apple , Alphabet , Amazon and Boeing . The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> fell 53.76 points, or 0.3 percent, to 18,169.27, the S&P 500 <.SPX> lost 8.17 points, or 0.38 percent, to 2,143.16 and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> dropped 26.43 points, or 0.5 percent, to 5,283.40. The dollar was a hair lower against a basket of major currencies <.DXY> after touching an eight-month high. Growing expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve would raise interest rates in December had boosted the dollar to its highest level in more than seven months against the euro and about three months against the yen. When BoE policymakers meet next week to consider whether to cut interest rates, they will "undoubtedly" take sterling's weakness into account, BoE Governor Mark Carney told lawmakers on Tuesday. "Carney's comments cast doubt on easing from Europe," said Kathy Lien, managing director at BK Asset Management in New York. Sterling slumped to its lowest level since the Oct. 7 "flash crash" but recovered some of its losses on Carney's remarks. The pound was last down 0.47 percent. In European stocks, mining companies <.SXPP> rose 3.2 percent, lifted in part by Anglo American , up 4.55 percent after its production update. Anglo is the top-performing stock on Europe's STOXX 600 <.STOXX> this year. The U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index <.FTSE> extended gains, closing up 0.45 percent. Germany's DAX <.GDAXI> turned slightly lower, ending down 0.04 percent, after hitting its highest level of the year. The closely-watched Ifo survey beat expectations, a day after purchasing manager numbers had done the same. Metal prices surged, with zinc up 2.37 percent at $2,366.85, but off an earlier three-week high of $2,376. It is up nearly 60 percent from January lows on worries about shortages. Other commodity prices slipped, though, as many are priced in U.S. dollars. U.S. crude oil futures settled 56 cents lower at $49.96 per barrel, down 1.11 percent.

"Following" : "Follow"}} October 25, 2016 11:52am   Comments Share: It’s an epic earnings day on Wall Street, as a collection of massive U.S. companies report results, including Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) and five other Dow components. Fed speakers and housing data help round out the schedule. Earnings just keep rumbling on here as we near the end of October, and so far, there’s been little not to like. To date, more than 75% of companies have beat expectations, and, in a truly positive sign, nearly 80% have beaten Wall Street’s consensus estimates on the revenue side of the coin. Futures trading pointed toward a slightly higher open. Approximately 180 S&P 500 companies report results this week, and it seems like a big portion of them come today. Among the big names are Merck & Co., Inc (NYSE: MRK), Eli Lilly and Co (NYSE: LLY), 3M Co (NYSE: MMM), and E I Du Pont De Nemours And Co (NYSE: DD). And waiting in the wings is Apple, which reports after the close (see below). Expect the flavor of the market this week to mostly be shaped by individual company earnings stories, and remember, there’s still a lot to come after today, with names like Boeing Co (NYSE: BA), The Coca-Cola Co (NYSE: KO), Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) on tap in the coming days. By the end of the week, investors should have pretty good insight into the health of big U.S. companies. Earlier today, another biggie reported, as Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE: CAT) surpassed earnings per share estimates but didn’t match Wall Street analysts’ estimates on revenue. The company also lowered its full-year guidance, and, in a statement, cited “economic weakness throughout the world.” But MRK shares zoomed up 3% early Tuesday after the company solidly beat on earnings and revenue. 3M, Procter & Gamble Co (NYSE: PG) and DD also beat estimates. Bond prices remain under pressure, in part from solid U.S. economic data, and the yield on U.S. 10-year Treasury bonds is back above 1.75%. It’s also noteworthy that the yield curve is on its way up, meaning the spread between short-term and longer-term yields is increasing. This can be a positive factor for the financial sector, and sure enough, financials are up nearly 2% over the last week, solidly ahead of the broader market. Consumer confidence reached nine-year highs last month, and we’ll find out if that lasted into October when the Conference Board reports at 10 a.m. ET today. Perhaps a better measure of consumer confidence is durable goods data, due Thursday morning. And the Case-Shiller 20-city housing index and the FHFA Housing Index, both out this morning, might also provide more insight into the consumer economy. Atlanta Federal Reserve President Dennis Lockhart speaks this afternoon. Chicago Fed President Charles Evans made some dovish remarks on Monday about potentially keeping the federal funds rate lower for longer. M&A Volume Scampering Up: Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activity is picking up here in Q4, with the biggest recent deal the $85 billion agreement for AT&T Inc. (NYSE: T) to purchase Time Warner Inc (NYSE: TWX). That was just one of a few recent deals totaling nearly $240 billion that have a chance to make 2016 the second-biggest M&A year on record after 2015 if just a handful of the current deals come to fruition, Bloomberg noted. M&A activity became rather sluggish in the wake of the Great Recession, falling well over 50% on a value basis between 2007 and 2009 before waking up and slowly growing until the record activity of last year. A relatively slow-growing economy that makes it hard for companies to out-perform, combined with low interest rates that provide easy access to financing, often can make M&A seem more attractive. On the other hand, the agreement between T and TWX appears to face a challenging regulatory scrutiny, and politicians from both major parties expressed concern that the deal could concentrate too much power in too few hands. We’ll see what ultimately gets done with this one. Are Samsung’s Struggles Handing AAPL a Bigger Slice of Market? As anyone who’s been on an airplane flight recently probably knows, airlines have banned Samsung’s Galaxy 7 phone because it might be a fire hazard, and the phone has been recalled. Did this steer additional customers to Apple, which reports earnings after the close today? That’s one thing to keep an eye on, and investors might also be curious to see how AAPL’s new iPhone 7 did during its first months on the market. Though the iPhone 7 and Samsung’s struggles could take the headlines, it’s also worth watching to see if AAPL continues to see falling sales overall, as it has the last two quarters. The phone market keeps getting tougher, and in Q2, AAPL’s sales fell 15% from a year earlier, the second quarter in a row of falling sales. For Q3, analysts surveyed by Briefing.com expect earnings per share of $1.65, down from $1.96 a year ago, but the company’s share price remains near its high for the year. Going Opposite Ways? Stocks were tracking crude oil rather closely last week, but the relationship appeared to break down a little on Monday, as the S&P 500 Index (Index: SPX) rose nearly 0.5% while front-month U.S. crude futures fell around the same amount, dipping below $50 a barrel during the session before recovering slightly. Pressure on oil came from the fundamental side, as Iraq said it wouldn’t necessarily abide by an OPEC output freeze. But later in the day, Iran said it would encourage other countries to join. Oil futures have been trading back and forth near the $50 level for several weeks, perhaps a sign of how difficult it is to pierce this mark. Last week saw 11 new oil rigs added to U.S. production, according to the Baker Hughes weekly report, if anyone needed a reminder that higher prices often lead to more U.S. drilling, which can lead to lower prices.   TD Ameritrade and all third parties mentioned are separate and unaffiliated companies, and are not responsible for each other’s policies or services.

Disappointing results from fast-food chains to makers of appliances, sports apparel and home-renovation products sparked a selloff in consumer-discretionary stocks amid speculation the economy’s biggest engine is sputtering. The S&P 500 Index fell 0.4 percent to 2,143.16 at 4 p.m. in New York, slipping from a two-week high and closing near its average price during the past 100 days. Apple Inc. declined in after-hours trading following its earnings report. Sonic Corp. plummeted 17 percent, Under Armour Inc. sank the most in almost eight years and Whirlpool Corp. lost 11 percent, rattling investors who anticipated recent signs of wage inflation would embolden spending by American households. Data Tuesday showed consumer confidence fell more than forecast amid concern about the pace of growth. Ahead of Friday’s third-quarter gross domestic product report, lackluster consumer earnings point to possible weakness in the largest component of the American economy. Apple lost 2.1 percent as of 4:57 p.m., even as it predicted higher-than-expected holiday sales, after its fiscal-fourth quarter sales and earnings were mostly in line with analysts’ estimates. “The consumer confidence number really took me by surprise, but we had that bad retail sales report two months ago and then a decent rebound,” said Brian Jacobsen, chief portfolio strategist with Wells Fargo Funds Management LLC, which oversees $242 billion. “Reports on U.S. consumers are following more of a saw-tooth pattern which makes it tough to discern the trend.” Weakness in consumer stocks isn’t new this year. While still the bull market’s leader, the group is the S&P 500’s second-worst performer in 2016 with a gain of just 1.3 percent, on pace for its weakest year since 2008. Similarly, groups of homebuilding and home-improvement stocks are on track for their worst years in a comparable period. “These stocks have really been stalling or showing some underperformance for the last year or so,” said Jonathan Krinsky, chief market technician at MKM Partners LLC in New York. “I don’t want to buy these names, but to me I’m not viewing it as a reason to sell the broad market.” Consumer-discretionary shares fell 1.2 percent, the worst in six weeks. Mohawk Industries Inc. dropped as the maker of residential flooring reported disappointing earnings. Weak results from paint maker Sherwin-Williams Co. helped drag Home Depot Inc. and Lowe’s Inc. down more than 3.4 percent. 3M Co. fell to a five-month low after trimming the top end of its profit outlook. General Motors Co. saw the steepest slide since August amid concerns industrywide U.S. sales are about to plateau after a record six years of gains. Not all reports were bad, even in the consumer sector. Procter & Gamble Co., which has spent years paring down its sprawling consumer-products empire, climbed the most in 14 months amid signs of renewed sales growth. United Technologies Corp. and Merck & Co. added at least 1.8 percent as results topped estimates. The three had the best gains in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which slipped 53.76 points, or 0.3 percent, to 18,169.27. About 6.3 billion shares traded hands on U.S. exchanges, in line with the three-month average. “We’re getting some good earnings, but it’s still been a fairly mixed picture,” said Matt Maley, an equity strategist at Miller Tabak & Co. LLC in New York. “They’re going to come out a little better than expected, but not great. My concern is that, with the dollar acting the way it is, the expectations for fourth quarter and first half 2017 earnings are going to be a little more subdued than they were just a few months ago.” The S&P 500 has been stuck in a 64-point trading range after reaching a record in August, as investors assess the likely trajectory of interest rates, the strength of corporate profits and economic data. The index hasn’t climbed for three consecutive sessions in more than a month as it struggles for direction. It trades at 18.2 times forecast earnings, the highest since at least 2009, and is 2.2 percent from its all-time high. More than a third of S&P 500 members are scheduled to post earnings this week, including Alphabet Inc., Coca-Cola Co., Amazon.com Inc. and Boeing Co. Analysts now predict year-on-year profit at S&P 500 members will be flat once the third-quarter reporting is finished, better than projections for a 1.5 percent contraction a month ago. Investors are also parsing economic reports and comments by policy makers for hints on the timing of the Federal Reserve’s next interest-rate increase. Along with the measure today on consumer confidence, releases on durable goods orders and gross domestic product are due later this week.  Traders are pricing less than one-in-five odds of a hike at the Fed’s next meeting, which takes place days before the presidential election, and a 73 percent chance of action in December, up 10 percentage points from a week ago. “Third-quarter earnings look like they will be a little better than expected, which is key,” said Patrick Spencer, London-based vice chairman of equities at Robert W. Baird, which manages $151 billion. “We’ve got concerns with regard to higher rates in December. That’s what’s dampening some of the enthusiasm.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid prev next prev next Thumbnail Enlarge Caption  Email More A A NEW YORK: U.S. stocks slipped from two-week highs on Tuesday as results and forecasts from companies in sectors including housing and consumer products failed to live up to expectations. Apple , the largest U.S. company by market capitalization, posted after the bell better-than-expected iPhone sales that however continued a declining trend and shares fell about 2 percent, briefly dragging S&P 500 futures to session lows. During the regular session, Whirlpool , down 10.8 percent to US$152.09, cited soft demand as it posted lower-than-expected earnings and gave an underwhelming forecast. Sherwin Williams' outlook also disappointed Wall Street and shares fell 10.9 percent to US$247.61. Both were an indication to some analysts that the housing sector may be cooling. "Lackluster results from Whirlpool and Sherwin Williams may indicate a slowing in the housing cycle," said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. She said those results could be weighing on Home Depot , which was down 3.5 percent at US$123.34 as the largest points decliner on the S&P 500. Lowes Cos fell 3.5 percent to US$68.47. Consumer products company Procter & Gamble rose 3.4 percent to US$86.97 after reporting a better-than-expected quarterly profit, while sportswear maker Under Armour fell 13.2 percent to US$32.89 after it reported its slowest quarterly sales growth in six years. “We had a rally (Monday) and haven’t been able to sustain it, due to weaker-than-expected numbers from some names,” said Peter Jankovskis, co-chief investment officer at OakBrook Investments in Lisle, Illinois, calling the day’s earnings a "mixed bag." Overall, annualized third-quarter earnings from S&P 500 companies are expected to have risen 1.7 percent, effectively putting an end to an earnings recession, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Of the 150 companies that have reported so far, 75.3 percent have beaten analyst expectations, above the long-term average of 63.5 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 53.76 points, or 0.3 percent, to 18,169.27, the S&P 500 lost 8.17 points, or 0.38 percent, to 2,143.16 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 26.43 points, or 0.5 percent, to 5,283.40. Futures were also pressured after the bell by a late decline in oil prices after data showed a bigger-than-expected build in U.S. crude inventories. 3M fell 2.9 percent to US$166.23 after the maker of Scotch tape and Post-it notes trimmed its full-year revenue and earnings forecasts for the second time. Caterpillar lost 1.8 percent after a downbeat forecast, while General Motors fell 4.2 percent amid fears regarding future profits. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.53-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.17-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 11 new 52-week highs and nine new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 67 new highs and 73 new lows. About 6.39 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, in line with the 6.4 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

In recent trading, the major averages have seen some further downside, hitting new lows for the session. The Dow is down 55.30 points or 0.3 percent at 18,167.73, the Nasdaq is down 21.31 points or 0.4 percent at 5,288.52 and the S&P 500 is down 8.14 points or 0.4 percent at 2,143.19. The weakness on Wall Street comes as traders react to the latest batch of earnings news, with a number of big-name companies releasing their quarterly results. Shares of Sonic (SONC) have fallen sharply on the day after the fast food chain reported better than expected fiscal fourth quarter earnings but provided disappointing guidance. Sportswear maker Under Amour (UA) has also come under pressure after the company said its growth rate going forward will be less than expected. On the other hand, shares of Procter & Gamble (PG) have shown a strong move to the upside after the consumer products giant reported fiscal first quarter results that exceeded analyst estimates. 3M (MMM), Caterpillar (CAT), and DuPont (DD) are among the other well known companies that released their quarterly results on the day, while tech giant Apple (AAPL) is due to release its results after the close. In economic news, the Conference Board released a report showing a bigger than expected drop in consumer confidence in the month of October. The Conference Board said its consumer confidence index fell to 98.6 in October after climbing to 103.5 in September. Economists had expected the index to drop to 101.0. "Consumers' assessment of current business and employment conditions softened, while optimism regarding the short-term outlook retreated somewhat," said Lynn Franco, Director of Economic Indicators at the Conference Board. She added, "Overall, sentiment is that the economy will continue to expand in the near-term, but at a moderate pace." Housing stocks have shown a significant move to the downside on the day, dragging the Philadelphia Housing Sector Index down by 1.9 percent. With the drop, the index has fallen to its lowest levels in nearly four months. Networking stocks have also shown a notable move to the downside, while some strength is visible among gold stocks. In overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region turned in a mixed performance during trading on Tuesday. Japan's Nikkei 225 Index advanced by 0.8 percent, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index edged down by 0.2 percent. The major European markets have also turned mixed on the day. While the French CAC 40 Index has edged down by 0.2 percent, the German DAX Index is up by 0.1 percent and the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index is up by 0.6 percent. In the bond market, treasuries have moved to the upside as the day has progressed. Subsequently, the yield on the benchmark ten-year note, which moves opposite of its price, is down by 1.4 basis points at 1.749 percent. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com Preview: Thanksgiving Week Economic Data Top Ten Corporate Comeback Stories The Most Influential Books In Business More Commentary -Global Stocks Move Modestly Lower Amid Quiet Trading Day - U.S. Commentary Stocks Seeing Modest Weakness In Mid-Day Trading - U.S. Commentary European Markets Pull Back On Light Data Day Stocks Showing A Lack Of Direction In Early Trading - U.S. Commentary Stocks May Show A Lack Of Direction In Early Trading - U.S. Commentary Wall Street On Slippery Grounds Sensex Falls For Fifth Day; Nifty Dips Marginally European Shares Fall As Banks And Miners Retreat FTSE 100 Drifts Lower As Stronger Dollar Hurts Commodity Stocks CAC 40 Slips Into Red As Banks Retreat DAX Rises As Volkswagen Outlines Turnaround Plan Asian Shares Recoup Early Losses European Shares To Open On Lackluster Note; Bank Stocks In Focus Sensex, Nifty Slip Into Red After Flat Start Asian Markets Mostly Higher <<Previous        118 Articles Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus Follow RTT Editor's Pick Most Read Most Emailed Volkswagen To Cut 23,000 Jobs In Germany Cyber Monday Sales Seen Soaring LinkedIn Is Now Blocked In Russia Facebook Stops WhatsApp Data Sharing Across Europe Over EU Criticism Wal-Mart Q3 Profit Declines, But Lifts FY17 Profit View; Stock Down JPMorgan Nears Over $250 Mln Settlement Over China Hiring Probe: Reports Comeback Kid: Donald Trump Hugely Resilient In Business, Too Target Lifts Q4, FY16 Forecast As Q3 Results Top Estimates Snapchat Parent Confidentially Initiates IPO Process Amazon Switching From Wrapping Paper To Reusable Bags Home Depot Black Friday Deals Heavy On Appliances Home Depot Lifts FY EPS View In Line With Market As Q3 Results Top Estimates FDA Snubs DVAX, Keep An Eye On OCUL, It's All Green For BLUE United Airlines Announces Plans For Long-term Earnings Growth Home Depot Black Friday Deals Heavy On Appliances LinkedIn Is Now Blocked In Russia AAA: Low Gas Prices Drive Spike In Thanksgiving Travel United Airlines Restricts Economy To One Small Carry-on BSTC Finds New Use For Old Drug, FHCO Gets A Boost, SUPN Put On Notice Crew Members Hurt As Canadian Plane Swerves To Avoid Possible Drone All Is Well With ACRS, First Avastin Biosimilar In The Works, CLRB Abuzz Vonovia Offers 0.496645 Shares/conwert Shr Or Alternative Cash Of EUR 16.16/shr Nokia Sets Financial & Strategic Targets; Remains Focused On Cost Saving Program Mid-week Mania In Abbreviated Week - Economic Preview United Airlines Restricts Economy To One Small Carry-on United Airlines Announces Plans For Long-term Earnings Growth Target Lifts Q4, FY16 Forecast As Q3 Results Top Estimates Deutsche Wohnen 9-month FFO I Rises Syngenta Gets Argentina Approval For MIRAVIS Duo With Fungicide ADEPIDYN FDA Snubs DVAX, Keep An Eye On OCUL, It's All Green For BLUE Crew Members Hurt As Canadian Plane Swerves To Avoid Possible Drone Merck KgaA Q3 Profit Climbs; Lifts 2016 EBITDA Pre-exceptionals Outlook United Internet 9-month EBITDA Rises Manz AG Posts Narrower Loss In 9-month - Quick Facts Smiths Group Q1 Revenues Climb; Says FY Forecast Unchanged - Quick Facts EasyJet Fiscal Year Profit Declines; Revenue Down 0.4% - Quick Facts Copyright © 2016 RTTNews.

Dow component Merck fell 1.3 percent to $59.90, while Eli Lilly fell 2.5 percent to $75.59. Apple, which is scheduled to report results after the close of the bell, was up 0.12 percent at $117.79. 3M fell 1.9 percent to $167.97 after the maker of Scotch tape and Post-it notes trimmed its full-year revenue and earnings forecasts for the second time. Procter & Gamble rose 3.9 percent to $87.50 after reporting a better-than-expected quarterly profit. Annualized third-quarter earnings from S&P 500 companies are expected to have risen 1.1 percent, following four quarters of contraction, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Of the 120 companies that have reported so far, 78 percent have beaten analyst expectations, above the long-term average of 63.5 percent. "Investors are looking at earnings which have been okay for the most part," said Andre Bakhos, managing director at Janlyn Capital LLC in Bernardsville, New Jersey. "It's not just the numbers that investors are looking at but also what the companies are saying especially about the big macro picture." Investors will also be keeping an eye on consumer confidence numbers for October which are expected to have fallen slightly. That data is expected at 10 a.m. ET (1400 GMT). At 9:45 a.m. ET (1345 GMT), the Dow Jones industrial average was down 12.47 points, or 0.07 percent, at 18,210.56, the S&P 500 was down 2.01 points, or 0.09 percent, at 2,149.32 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 1.87 points, or 0.04 percent, at 5,307.96. Six of the 11 major S&P sectors were lower, with the consumer discretionary index's 0.78 percent fall leading the decliners. The S&P 500 hit a two-week high on Monday, helped by strong earnings, while a flurry of acquisitions indicated corporate America continues to see untapped value in the market. Global stocks were also higher on Tuesday as upbeat economic data and signs of a revival in inflation pushed up stocks and commodity prices and kept the dollar at a nine-month high. Oil edged up ahead of the release of U.S. crude inventory data, which in recent weeks has provided bullish surprises, but top-level comments from OPEC members regarding chances of an output cut kept a lid on prices. The dollar index was up 0.26 percent at 99.02 against a basket of major currencies, its highest level since early February. A strong dollar could dent the earnings of large multinationals. Whirlpool fell 9.8 percent at $153.61 after the home appliances maker's revenue took a hit from a strong dollar. Under Armour fell 14.3 percent to $32.40 after the sportswear maker reported its slowest quarterly sales growth in six years. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 1,432 to 1,143. On the Nasdaq, 1,190 issues fell and 1,000 advanced. The S&P 500 index showed nine new 52-week highs and seven new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 37 new highs and 24 new lows.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermidMore By Rodrigo Campos NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks slipped from two-week highs on Tuesday as results and forecasts from companies in sectors including housing and consumer products failed to live up to expectations. Apple <AAPL.O>, the largest U.S. company by market capitalization, posted after the bell better-than-expected iPhone sales that however continued a declining trend and shares fell about 2 percent, briefly dragging S&P 500 futures <ESc1> to session lows. During the regular session, Whirlpool <WHR.N>, down 10.8 percent to $152.09, cited soft demand as it posted lower-than-expected earnings and gave an underwhelming forecast. Sherwin Williams' <SHW.N> outlook also disappointed Wall Street and shares fell 10.9 percent to $247.61. Both were an indication to some analysts that the housing sector may be cooling. "Lackluster results from Whirlpool and Sherwin Williams may indicate a slowing in the housing cycle," said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. She said those results could be weighing on Home Depot <HD.N>, which was down 3.5 percent at $123.34 as the largest points decliner on the S&P 500. Lowes Cos <LOW.N> fell 3.5 percent to $68.47. Consumer products company Procter & Gamble <PG.N> rose 3.4 percent to $86.97 after reporting a better-than-expected quarterly profit, while sportswear maker Under Armour <UA.N> fell 13.2 percent to $32.89 after it reported its slowest quarterly sales growth in six years. “We had a rally (Monday) and haven’t been able to sustain it, due to weaker-than-expected numbers from some names,” said Peter Jankovskis, co-chief investment officer at OakBrook Investments in Lisle, Illinois, calling the day’s earnings a "mixed bag." Overall, annualized third-quarter earnings from S&P 500 companies are expected to have risen 1.7 percent, effectively putting an end to an earnings recession, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Of the 150 companies that have reported so far, 75.3 percent have beaten analyst expectations, above the long-term average of 63.5 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> fell 53.76 points, or 0.3 percent, to 18,169.27, the S&P 500 <.SPX> lost 8.17 points, or 0.38 percent, to 2,143.16 and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> dropped 26.43 points, or 0.5 percent, to 5,283.40. Futures were also pressured after the bell by a late decline in oil prices <CLc1> <LCOc1> after data showed a bigger-than-expected build in U.S. crude inventories. 3M <MMM.N> fell 2.9 percent to $166.23 after the maker of Scotch tape and Post-it notes trimmed its full-year revenue and earnings forecasts for the second time. Caterpillar <CAT.N> lost 1.8 percent after a downbeat forecast, while General Motors <GM.N> fell 4.2 percent amid fears regarding future profits. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.53-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.17-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 11 new 52-week highs and nine new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 67 new highs and 73 new lows. About 6.39 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, in line with the 6.4 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

Dow component Merck fell 1.3 percent to $59.90, while Eli Lilly fell 2.5 percent to $75.59. Apple, which is scheduled to report results after the close of the bell, was up 0.12 percent at $117.79. 3M fell 1.9 percent to $167.97 after the maker of Scotch tape and Post-it notes trimmed its full-year revenue and earnings forecasts for the second time. Procter & Gamble rose 3.9 percent to $87.50 after reporting a better-than-expected quarterly profit. Annualized third-quarter earnings from S&P 500 companies are expected to have risen 1.1 percent, following four quarters of contraction, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Of the 120 companies that have reported so far, 78 percent have beaten analyst expectations, above the long-term average of 63.5 percent. "Investors are looking at earnings which have been okay for the most part," said Andre Bakhos, managing director at Janlyn Capital LLC in Bernardsville, New Jersey. "It's not just the numbers that investors are looking at but also what the companies are saying especially about the big macro picture." Investors will also be keeping an eye on consumer confidence numbers for October which are expected to have fallen slightly. That data is expected at 10 a.m. ET (1400 GMT). At 9:45 a.m. ET (1345 GMT), the Dow Jones industrial average was down 12.47 points, or 0.07 percent, at 18,210.56, the S&P 500 was down 2.01 points, or 0.09 percent, at 2,149.32 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 1.87 points, or 0.04 percent, at 5,307.96. Six of the 11 major S&P sectors were lower, with the consumer discretionary index's 0.78 percent fall leading the decliners. The S&P 500 hit a two-week high on Monday, helped by strong earnings, while a flurry of acquisitions indicated corporate America continues to see untapped value in the market. Global stocks were also higher on Tuesday as upbeat economic data and signs of a revival in inflation pushed up stocks and commodity prices and kept the dollar at a nine-month high. Oil edged up ahead of the release of U.S. crude inventory data, which in recent weeks has provided bullish surprises, but top-level comments from OPEC members regarding chances of an output cut kept a lid on prices. The dollar index was up 0.26 percent at 99.02 against a basket of major currencies, its highest level since early February. A strong dollar could dent the earnings of large multinationals. Whirlpool fell 9.8 percent at $153.61 after the home appliances maker's revenue took a hit from a strong dollar. Under Armour fell 14.3 percent to $32.40 after the sportswear maker reported its slowest quarterly sales growth in six years. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 1,432 to 1,143. On the Nasdaq, 1,190 issues fell and 1,000 advanced. The S&P 500 index showed nine new 52-week highs and seven new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 37 new highs and 24 new lows.

Investors closely followed third-quarter results on Tuesday. Credit Lucas Jackson/Reuters Shaky results from consumer companies dragged the stock market lower on Tuesday as well-known names like the appliance maker Whirlpool and the athletic apparel maker Under Armour suffered their worst losses in years. Third-quarter earnings continued to dominate the market, and some of the biggest companies either reported disappointing results or lowered their expectations. Investors wondered if consumers would spend less on home improvement, clothing and other goods. But shares of companies including Procter & Gamble and Lockheed Martin soared after their reports. Looking for safer options, some investors bought bonds and utility company shares and also bid up the price of gold. Consumer spending is critical to the economy, and poor results for consumer-focused companies could be a sign of trouble. But Doug Roman, managing director of equities for PNC Capital Advisors, said it was too soon to know if shoppers were closing their wallets.

Corporate earnings have been falling for more than a year, and despite the results on Tuesday, investors are growing hopeful that streak is ending. The Dow Jones industrial average shed 53.76 points, or 0.3 percent, to 18,169.27. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index lost 8.17 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,143.16.

Whirlpool’s results fell far short of analyst projections. Sherwin-Williams had its worst day in seven years as it lost $30.27, or 10.9 percent, to $247.61. Whirlpool, which owns Maytag and KitchenAid, sank $18.37, or 10.8 percent, to $152.09, its largest loss in five years. Under Armour reported its slowest sales growth in six years and said its future sales would not be as strong as it expected a year ago. Its stock tumbled $5.01, or 13.2 percent, to $32.89, its biggest drop in almost eight years. Its rival Nike also slipped. Procter & Gamble, which makes Tide detergent and Charmin toilet paper, had its best day in more than a year after it reported better results than investors expected. The consumer products giant has been selling some businesses to cut costs, and it posted stronger sales of personal care products like toothbrushes and deodorants. Its stock rose $2.87, or 3.4 percent, to $86.97. The aerospace and defense company Lockheed Martin surpassed investor forecasts and raised its projections for the year. Its stock gained $17.00, or 7.3 percent, to $249.26, its biggest leap in seven years. Earnings releases continued to stream in after the market closed. Apple reported lower quarterly sales and sold fewer iPhones, sending its stock down about 2 percent in late trading.

Investors were also pleased that the company was preparing to cut more costs. Baker Hughes said it planned to eliminate $650 million in spending this year, up from the $500 million it had planned to cut. Its stock climbed $2.24, or 4.3 percent, to $54.39.

The company has also been trying to keep its spending in check. The stock rose $1.21, or 2 percent, to $61.95. The 3M Company, which makes Post-it Notes, industrial coatings and ceramics, forecast weaker sales growth and a smaller profit for the year. The stock declined $5.04, or 2.9 percent, to $166.23. Nielsen, the media and marketing information company, took its biggest loss ever after it reported shaky results and cut its guidance. Nielsen stock tumbled $9.28, or 16.9 percent, to $45.65. Benchmark crude lost 56 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $49.96 per barrel in New York. Brent crude, the international standard, fell 67 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $50.79 a barrel in London. Bond prices edged higher. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 1.76 percent from 1.77 percent. Investors bought shares of utility companies and sought out precious metals amid uncertainty.

Video provided by TheStreet Newslook Trader Patrick McKeon, center, works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, Monday, Oct. 24, 2016. (AP Photo/Richard Drew) (Photo: Richard Drew, AP) U.S. stocks fell Tuesday as investors digest an avalanche of corporate earnings that were mixed, with blue chip consumer-products maker Procter & Gamble faring well but others like heavy equipment maker Caterpillar disappointing Wall Street. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 54 points, or 0.3%, to close at 18,169. The Standard & Poor's 500 stock index fell 0.4% to 2143 and the Nasdaq composite was 0.5% lower to 5283. Wall Street got a large slate of earnings reports from Dow components, including well-received reports from P&G (PG), which reported organic growth of 3%, as well as United Technologies (UTX), and drug maker Merck (MRK), which topped forecast with the help of strong sales of its cancer drug Keytruda. But the good news was offset by weaker-than-expected results from companies like 3M (MMM) and Caterpillar (CAT), which cut its earnings view for the remainder of 2016, citing sluggish sales of its heavy equipment. P&G shares rose 3.4%. Merck's stock rose  2%. And United Technologies shares jumped 1.9%. Caterpillar fell 1.8% and 3M fell 3%. Shares of Dow component and chemical giant DuPont (DD) fell 0.7% despite topping profit and sales forecast and boosting its full-year 2016 earnings outlook. 3M shares fell 3% and Caterpillar's stock was unchanged. Caterpillar's outgoing CEO Doug Oberhelman, who is retiring later this year, painted a gloomy picture of the global economy, noting that "economic weakness throughout much of the world persists," in a press release containing the company's earnings results. USA TODAY History suggests S&P set up for future gains With the presidential election now two weeks away, investors are also bracing for the homestretch of the campaign and gearing up for any potential surprises. Stocks have held up nicely in recent sessions as the third-quarter earnings season has gotten off to a better-than-expected start. Earnings growth for the July-thru-September quarter is above 1% currently, which has raised hopes that the quarterly streak of contracting earnings growth will end at four. In economic news, consumer confidence fell more than expected in October, according to the Conference Board. But data on the U.S. housing market remained solid. The S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller U.S. home price index rose 0.2% in August and another index that tracks purchase prices saw an uptick of 0.7% in August, according to FHFA. iPhone maker Apple reports its quarterly profit results after today's closing bell.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid prev next prev next Thumbnail Enlarge Caption  Email More A A NEW YORK: U.S. stocks slipped from two-week highs on Tuesday as results and forecasts from companies in sectors including housing and consumer products failed to live up to expectations. Apple , the largest U.S. company by market capitalization, posted after the bell better-than-expected iPhone sales that however continued a declining trend and shares fell about 2 percent, briefly dragging S&P 500 futures to session lows. During the regular session, Whirlpool , down 10.8 percent to US$152.09, cited soft demand as it posted lower-than-expected earnings and gave an underwhelming forecast. Sherwin Williams' outlook also disappointed Wall Street and shares fell 10.9 percent to US$247.61. Both were an indication to some analysts that the housing sector may be cooling. "Lackluster results from Whirlpool and Sherwin Williams may indicate a slowing in the housing cycle," said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. She said those results could be weighing on Home Depot , which was down 3.5 percent at US$123.34 as the largest points decliner on the S&P 500. Lowes Cos fell 3.5 percent to US$68.47. Consumer products company Procter & Gamble rose 3.4 percent to US$86.97 after reporting a better-than-expected quarterly profit, while sportswear maker Under Armour fell 13.2 percent to US$32.89 after it reported its slowest quarterly sales growth in six years. “We had a rally (Monday) and haven’t been able to sustain it, due to weaker-than-expected numbers from some names,” said Peter Jankovskis, co-chief investment officer at OakBrook Investments in Lisle, Illinois, calling the day’s earnings a "mixed bag." Overall, annualized third-quarter earnings from S&P 500 companies are expected to have risen 1.7 percent, effectively putting an end to an earnings recession, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Of the 150 companies that have reported so far, 75.3 percent have beaten analyst expectations, above the long-term average of 63.5 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 53.76 points, or 0.3 percent, to 18,169.27, the S&P 500 lost 8.17 points, or 0.38 percent, to 2,143.16 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 26.43 points, or 0.5 percent, to 5,283.40. Futures were also pressured after the bell by a late decline in oil prices after data showed a bigger-than-expected build in U.S. crude inventories. 3M fell 2.9 percent to US$166.23 after the maker of Scotch tape and Post-it notes trimmed its full-year revenue and earnings forecasts for the second time. Caterpillar lost 1.8 percent after a downbeat forecast, while General Motors fell 4.2 percent amid fears regarding future profits. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.53-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.17-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 11 new 52-week highs and nine new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 67 new highs and 73 new lows. About 6.39 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, in line with the 6.4 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

Dow component Merck rose 2.2 percent to $62.10 in premarket trading, while Procter & Gamble was up 2.6 percent at $86.34 after reporting earnings above expectations. Apple, which is scheduled to report results after the close of the bell, was up 0.37 percent at $118.08. Annualized third-quarter earnings from S&P 500 companies are expected to have risen 1.1 percent, following four quarters of contraction, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Of the 120 companies that have reported so far, 78 percent have beaten analyst expectations, above the long-term average of 63.5 percent. "Investors are looking at earnings which have been okay for the most part," said Andre Bakhos, managing director at Janlyn Capital LLC in Bernardsville, New Jersey. "It's not just the numbers that investors are looking at but also what the companies are saying especially about the big macro picture." Investors will also be keeping an eye on consumer confidence numbers for October which are expected to have fallen slightly. That data is expected at 10 a.m. ET (1400 GMT). S&P 500 e-minis were up 2.5 points, or 0.12 percent, with 94,687 contracts traded at 8:34 a.m. ET (1234 GMT). Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 9.5 points, or 0.19 percent, on volume of 18,618 contracts. Dow e-minis were up 16 points, or 0.09 percent, with 17,963 contracts changing hands. The S&P 500 hit a two-week high on Monday, helped by strong earnings, while a flurry of acquisitions indicated corporate America continues to see untapped value in the market. Global stocks were also higher on Tuesday as upbeat economic data and signs of a revival in inflation pushed up stocks and commodity prices and kept the dollar at a nine-month high. Oil edged up ahead of the release of U.S. crude inventory data, which in recent weeks has provided bullish surprises, but top-level comments from OPEC members regarding chances of an output cut kept a lid on prices. The dollar index was little changed at 98.83 against a basket of major currencies, after touching its highest level since early February, last week. A strong dollar could dent the earnings of large multinationals. Whirlpool fell 6 percent at $163.23 after the home appliances maker's revenue took a hit from a strong dollar. 3M fell 2.2 percent to $167.50 after the maker of Scotch tape and Post-it notes trimmed its full-year revenue and earnings forecasts for the second time.

Wall Street was set to tick higher with consumer confidence figures due and analysts already tucking into healthy-looking earnings from Procter & Gamble, General Motors and drugs giant Merck, but also a profit downgrade from Caterpillar. Europe had been cheered as Germany's Dax hit its highest level of the year after the closely-watched Ifo survey beat expectations a day after purchasing manager numbers had done the same. The region's mining firms were the standout performers though. They hit a 14-month top as zinc surged to a five-year peak and iron ore reached its highest since mid-2014, all of which should pick up the pulse of inflation globally. "We are seeing a pick-up of economic activity against the backdrop of only one central bank - the Fed - that is likely to tighten policy and that is supporting asset markets," said CMC Markets senior analyst Michael Hewson. In foreign exchange markets, the dollar took a breather having reached its highest since early February against other top currencies as traders continued to add to the bets on a December U.S. interest rate rise <_0FF:_>. China's yuan went the other way, hitting its lowest since "offshore" trading was introduced in 2010 as Beijing nudged down official rates again. It traded as soft as 6.7882 yuan per dollar. The currency's fall of more than 1.5 percent since the end of September has stirred renewed suspicion of a possible extended slide in the yuan, even though officials have reiterated their expectations for a stable currency. But the weakness has revived memories of a shock yuan devaluation last August and another rapid depreciation early this year - falls that triggered a bout of global market turmoil. Analysts pointed out, however, that during this round of yuan weakness, global risk sentiment was holding up. "That highlights the extent to which dollar gains are unlikely to be as extended as they were (in the past)," said BNP Paribas currency strategist Sam Lynton-Brown, in London. GOLDEN MINERS The cheer around the mining sector was increased further as a production update thrust London-listed giant Anglo American's shares up over 3 percent to take their gains this year to almost 270 percent. The staggering rise has made Anglo the top performing stock on Europe's STOXX 600 this year. In Asia, Japan's Nikkei rose 0.7 percent to close at a six-month high as a softening yen burnished the outlook for the country's exporters. Australian stocks added 0.6 percent and Taiwan 0.7 percent. Wall Street was taking encouragement from upbeat corporate results. Over one third of U.S. companies have now reported and 80 percent have beaten market expectations. Another third of the S&P 500 components are scheduled to report earnings later this week, including heavyweights Apple , Alphabet, Amazon and Boeing. Merger and acquisition activity added extra fizz in the wake of AT&T Inc's $85.4 billion bid for Time Warner Inc , though the deal seemed destined to face stringent scrutiny from regulators. Safe-haven bonds were feeling the strain of the bullish mood elsewhere with U.S. Treasury yields up to almost 1.78 percent again and European yields creeping higher. In commodities, oil prices briefly dipped on news of the impending restart of Britain's Buzzard oilfield and Iraq's wish to be exempted from OPEC production cuts. Brent was down 5 cents at $51.41 a barrel, while U.S. crude hovered at $50.50. But going the other way were metals with zinc, nickel, copper and tin all shining and Chinese iron ore futures reaching their highest since August 2014. Coal prices also reached new peaks after weeks of gains, a prop for the Australian dollar as the two commodities are the country's biggest export earners. Another mover was the Canadian dollar which rebounded from a seven-month low after Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz said the decision on whether to cut interest rates again was not one to take lightly. The comments countered recent speculation about an imminent easing and nudged the U.S. dollar down to C$1.3333 from a peak at C$1.3398.

Sun, Nov 20, 2016, 18:17 GMT - UK Markets closed GLOBAL MARKETS-Stocks, commodities climb as economic confidence risesReuters - UK Focus – Tue, Oct 25, 2016 13:20 BST Share 0 Tweet 0 Share0 Print Companies: Merck KGaA BNP Paribas SA Anglo American plc RELATED QUOTES Symbol Price Change 0O14.L 88.095 -1.720 BNP.PA 54.39 -0.21 AAL.L 1,089.50 -37.00 6549.TWO 24.07 +0.07 AAPL.SW 111.00 +1.00 * Europe pushes higher as DAX hits year to date high * US dollar supported after solid manufacturing survey * Wall St expected to tick higher on upbeat earnings, M&A frenzy * Oil drifts lower but steel, industrial commodities on the rise By Marc Jones LONDON, Oct (Shenzhen: 000069.SZ - news) 25 (Reuters) - World markets (Xetra: 4WM.DE - news) had a swagger about them on Tuesday as upbeat economic data and signs of a revival in inflation pushed up stocks and commodity prices and kept the dollar at a nine-month high. Wall Street was set to tick higher with consumer confidence figures due and analysts already tucking into healthy-looking earnings from Procter & Gamble, General Motors (NYSE: GM - news) and drugs giant Merck (LSE: 0O14.L - news) , but also a profit downgrade from Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT - news) . Europe had been cheered as Germany's Dax hit its highest level of the year after the closely-watched Ifo survey beat expectations a day after purchasing manager numbers had done the same. The region's mining firms were the standout performers though. They hit a 14-month top as zinc surged to a five-year peak and iron ore reached its highest since mid-2014, all of which should pick up the pulse of inflation globally. "We are seeing a pick-up of economic activity against the backdrop of only one central bank - the Fed - that is likely to tighten policy and that is supporting asset markets," said CMC (Shanghai: 600327.SS - news) Markets senior analyst Michael Hewson. In foreign exchange markets, the dollar took a breather having reached its highest since early February against other top currencies as traders continued to add to the bets on a December U.S. interest rate rise . China's yuan went the other way, hitting its lowest since "offshore" trading was introduced in 2010 as Beijing nudged down official rates again. It traded as soft as 6.7882 yuan per dollar. The currency's fall of more than 1.5 percent since the end of September has stirred renewed suspicion of a possible extended slide in the yuan, even though officials have reiterated their expectations for a stable currency. But the weakness has revived memories of a shock yuan devaluation last August and another rapid depreciation early this year - falls that triggered a bout of global market turmoil. Analysts pointed out, however, that during this round of yuan weakness, global risk sentiment was holding up. "That highlights the extent to which dollar gains are unlikely to be as extended as they were (in the past)," said BNP (Paris: FR0000131104 - news) Paribas currency strategist Sam Lynton-Brown, in London. GOLDEN MINERS The cheer around the mining sector was increased further as a production update thrust London-listed giant Anglo American (LSE: AAL.L - news) 's shares up over 3 percent to take their gains this year to almost 270 percent. The staggering rise has made Anglo the top performing stock on Europe's STOXX 600 this year. In Asia, Japan's Nikkei rose 0.7 percent to close at a six-month high as a softening yen burnished the outlook for the country's exporters. Australian stocks added 0.6 percent and Taiwan (Taiwan OTC: 6549.TWO - news) 0.7 percent. Wall Street was taking encouragement from upbeat corporate results. Over one third of U.S. companies have now reported and 80 percent have beaten market expectations. Another third of the S&P 500 components are scheduled to report earnings later this week, including heavyweights Apple (Swiss: AAPL.SW - news) , Alphabet (Xetra: ABEA.DE - news) , Amazon and Boeing (NYSE: BA - news) . Merger and acquisition activity added extra fizz in the wake of AT&T Inc (Sao Paolo: ATTB34F.SA - news) 's $85.4 billion bid for Time Warner Inc (Xetra: AOL1.DE - news) , though the deal seemed destined to face stringent scrutiny from regulators. Safe-haven bonds were feeling the strain of the bullish mood elsewhere with U.S. Treasury yields up to almost 1.78 percent again and European yields creeping higher. In commodities, oil prices briefly dipped on news of the impending restart of Britain's Buzzard oilfield and Iraq's wish to be exempted from OPEC production cuts. Brent was down 5 cents at $51.41 a barrel, while U.S. crude hovered at $50.50. But going the other way were metals with zinc, nickel, copper and tin all shining and Chinese iron ore futures reaching their highest since August 2014. Coal prices also reached new peaks after weeks of gains, a prop for the Australian dollar as the two commodities are the country's biggest export earners. Another mover was the Canadian dollar which rebounded from a seven-month low after Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz said the decision on whether to cut interest rates again was not one to take lightly. The comments countered recent speculation about an imminent easing and nudged the U.S. dollar down to C$1.3333 from a peak at C$1.3398.

Who We Are Politics Article Comments Your Email Recipient's Email Message (Optional) Send Cancel Frelinghuysen Challenged by Underfinanced Democrat in 11th Joe Tyrrell | October 25, 2016 Lawyer Joe Wenzel says he was inspired to run by Sandy Hook Elementary School killings in 2012 Rodney Frelinghuysen, 11-term Republican incumbent in 11th District Stretching from the misty Ramapo Mountains to lush Morris County estates, from Ogdensburg to West Orange, the 11th Congressional District offers a layer of polish over a bit of grit. Yes, garden parties are frequent, but the 11th also showcases military might at Picatinny Arsenal and throbbing commerce in regional malls and long-established downtowns. People who live here tend to be better educated and better off than the average New Jerseyan, though some of that has changed through redistricting. While the district was almost 87 percent white in the 2000 Census, the figure is now closer to 73 percent with more towns in Passaic County added to the Morris County core. The 11th still covers a bit of Essex County, its base for much of the 20th century, and a few towns in Sussex County. That multi-county conglomeration brings together towns with different populations and priorities, but in the aggregate its voters are faithfully Republican. No one captures the old-time, old-money GOP vibe better than 11-term incumbent Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen, 70, scion of one of New Jersey's oldest political dynasties and largest fortunes. His mother was a Procter & Gamble heir, while his father served 22 years in the House of Representatives, a record Frelinghuysen stands poised to surpass. Joe Wenzel, Democratic challenger for Congress in District 11 Joe Wenzel, the Democratic candidate, is a West Orange lawyer who previously served a stint on the school board in Clifton. Wenzel said he was energized to run by Congress's failure to address gun violence after the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut. Libertarian Jeff Hetrick and Thomas DePasquale, running under the tag of the “Financial Independence Party,” widen the options for voters dissatisfied with the status quo. But Frelinghuysen and Wenzel, who had the backing of three of the district's four Democratic county organizations, both easily won contested primaries. Frelinghuysen has more tangible support. In this election cycle. His campaign has reported more than $1.8 million in contributions and had $658,953 on hand at the end of September, according to the Federal Elections Commission. His political action committee, Liberty & Prosperity, reported $270,449 in receipts. None of the other candidates reported any fundraising. Well positioned as a member of the House Appropriations Committee and chair of its defense appropriations subcommittee, Frelinghuysen draws significant contributions from the aerospace and pharmaceutical industries. Jeff Hetrick, Libertarian candidate for Congressional seat in District 11 Hetrick, 38, of Chatham Township, has made two unsuccessful runs for state Assembly. He works in quality assurance, which he says has brought him into contact with businesses in a range of major industries. He promises to vote against "any legislation that I believe would increase the size and scope of government." As "a strong advocate of term limits," Hetrick said it is time for Frelinghuysen to retire. Neither major party candidate attended a recent debate, DePasquale said, because "the Democrat knows he can't win and the Republican knows he's a shoo-in." Districts have been drawn to protect incumbents, meaning "voters don't have a real choice," said DePasquale, 57, of Wayne. Thomas DePasquale is running for Congress in the 11th District on the Financial Independence Party ticket. The owner of a tax preparation business, DePasquale wants to curb the federal deficit and stop job-killing trade deals. He acknowledged third-party candidates face long odds. "I'm trying to bring awareness to what's wrong with the system," he said. To Wenzel, it is time for new leadership in Washington. The Sandy Hook slaughter of school children seemed to demand mature discussion but produced "resounding silence" in the Congress, he said — "Not one bill was passed, not one committee hearing called, no one thing changed." Gun control does not strike Frelinghuysen as a pressing matter.  He has said civilians probably do not need assault weapons but added many of his colleagues are uncomfortable with stricter gun laws. In 2002, the National Rifle Association gave Frelinghuysen's positions the lowest score among New Jersey congressional Republicans, 23 percent favorable. But in recent years he has received a solid "B" rating from the group. The Vietnam veteran is worried about the effects of "America's retreat from the world stage" under President Barack Obama. For a member of Congress "there is no greater responsibility" than providing a strong national defense and homeland security, Frelinghuysen said. At the district level, that has meant continued funding for Picatinny Arsenal, the headquarters of the U.S. Army's armament research, development, and engineering. Wenzel said Congress has ignored the threat posed to the world, the country, and New Jersey by rising sea levels and the other effects of climate change caused by overuse of fossil fuels and man-made chemicals. He recalled learning about the problems as a student at Rutgers University more than two decades ago. But he argued there is still an opportunity to start fixing the problem. Trade agreements with fast developing countries like India and China could include steps to limit hazardous emissions, according to Wenzel. Wenzel and Frelinghuysen agree that securing a better economic future should be a major priority. Wenzel argues that embracing technological change is part of the solution. He points to the many successful entrepreneurs in the tech sector as models for other businesses. If elected, he would propose funding for small-business incubators across the country, as well as small loans and grants to help startups get off the ground. Frelinghuysen said Congress and the administration should work together toward “economic freedom." Higher taxes and regulations and the "threat of increased government mandates" hamper growth, he said. He called for reversing President Obama's "policies that drive up gas prices." Frelinghuysen favors "unlocking American energy production" to provide jobs and reduce dependence of foreign oil. Frelinghuysen also contends the Obamacare health insurance system is damaging the economy and should be reworked. He supports retaining the provisions that prevent insurers from citing "pre-existing conditions" to deny coverage but would also limit lawsuits. Wenzel would move toward a single-payer health insurance system, such as Canada's comprehensive Medicare or Taiwan's national health insurance. Some American proponents describe it as "Medicare for all," with a national program that would pay for coverage while private professionals would continue to provide care.

That's because many companies including Snapdeal and SLK Global Solutions, among others, are gifting exciting experiences to their employees, be it a romantic yacht ride with one's partner, recording one's own song in a studio, or flying a microlight. Corporate gifting is going beyond cash award, gift vouchers, conventional certificates, medals and trophies as an increasing representation of millennials in the workforce is prompting companies to think of experiences as gifts. Giftxoxo, a tech-enabled marketplace for experiences and activities, has a host of leading corporates such as BCG, Flipkart, Procter & Gamble, and BlueJeans Network India using its platform to gift experiences to their people. BCG and Flipkart did not respond to emails with queries about their gifting plans as of press time on Monday while P&G refused to participate in this story. "Gifting has evolved in recent times. Even a couple of years back acceptance of this was tough," said Sumit Khandelwal, cofounder at Giftxoxo. "But we have really seen a pickup in the last 6-12 months," he said. This festive season on an average Giftxoxo is getting 10-12 leads from corporates a day compared to 10-12 a month a year ago, Khandelwal said. Ecommerce major Snapdeal gifts experiences to its employees with to make recognition social, its HR director Abhishek Budhraja said. "Giving cash takes away the entire feeling of recognition and we wanted to move away from that," he said. "Instead of giving a voucher we thought we would engage with a portal that has option for every employee," Budhraja said. Some of the experiences popular among Snapdeal employees include parasailing, hot air balloon, Royal Enfield ride around Delhi, and fine dining experience at a five star hotel, he said. The HR head of a global cloud service provider, said, "The entire idea is to move away from cash related things as we wanted to cater to our younger set of employees. We want them to really remember the recognition given to them and feel a sense of pride." The average age group of employees in the company is 28 and for somebody like that the experiences that the company brings to the table are exciting. The company uses experience gifting for peer-to-peer recognition, referral bonus, and quarterly awards. One of India's biggest information technology companies has been running experience gifting as a pilot for the last eight months for its long service awards (10-15-20-25 years). Some of the gifts it has given include a romantic dinner on top of the world at a helipad in Bengaluru and exotic spa experience. "This is a novel concept and the company is running it as a pilot as it wants to give these experience to employees to celebrate the milestones," said an employee. Process outsourcing company SLK Global Solutions wanted to gift its employees experiences that they keep dreaming of and make them feel special and wanted for their contribution and achievement at work. "Experience gifting has gone down very well with the employees. The new generation welcomes it and it allows us to connect closely with them," said Taruna Lohmror, programme director for HR at SLK Global Solutions. Some of the popular experiences being gifted by corporates in the country include a romantic private gourmet session on a helipad, pizza making session at a fivestar hotel, playing RJ or DJ for a day, private island dining with a spa, horse riding session followed by stable management ending with an exotic Italian dinner at the stable, and romantic yacht ride with one's partner in the Arabian Sea.

Tongal will be responsible for digital content strategy as well as content creation, including “the development and production of an amplified slate of content based on Mattel’s library of iconic brands.” “Mattel Creations is dedicated to discovering new ways to share creative, captivating stories across all platforms. Our partnership with Tongal and its robust network of creators will enable us to build out an innovative, scalable offering of content for all channels and markets around the world,” Mattel chief content officer Catherine Balsam-Schwaber said in a statement. “Tongal is re-defining the content model and we look forward to working closely with their team to further our brand strategies and build our storytelling platform.” Under the agreement, Tongal will utilize its creative network to create content across broadcast, digital and social media channels, enhancing Mattel Creation’s content capabilities and digital offerings. The agreement does not impact Mattel’s relationship with primary creative agency BBDO or affect BBDO’s responsibilities for the brand. In fact, sources tell us Mattel has actually expanded its relationship with the agency. That said, Tongal head of strategy and client development Vaughan Emsley, who joined Tongal in the newly-created position this August after serving as both global CEO on the P&G business and strategic advisor to global chairman Kevin Roberts with Saatchi & Saatchi recently told Adweek, “Any company with an open source approach like ours is seen by agencies as a competitor.” BBDO, of course, recently launched its own crowdsourced content offering via AMV BBDO’s Flare Studio. “Mattel has long been a champion for innovation in storytelling, including being one of the earliest adopters of Tongal over six years ago,” said Tongal CEO Rob Salvatore. “This multi-year deal is an exciting next step in our partnership and reinforces their commitment to creativity. We’re honored to be helping them develop new ways to connect with audiences around the world.” The first work to emerge from the partnership will be a behind-the-scenes feature designed to complement the Amazon Original special An American Girl Story—Melody 1963: Love Has to Win and will premiere some time next month. < Previous Article Next Article > Advertisement Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

Raise the Hammer About Principles Authors Comments Submissions Register Forget Password? Special Report: Light Rail Our Right to a Healthy Environment Includes Light Rail We have the right to breathe clean air, and City Council has sworn to protect this right. By Chris Parkinson Published October 26, 2016 The following is the text of my delegation to the October 25, 2016 General Issues Committee meeting on Hamilton's Light Rail Transit (LRT) project. On February 18, 2015, every single member of our current council, except one, in a standing vote, unanimously passed a motion declaring every Hamiltonian's Right to a Healthy Environment. A proud moment for our city, we were the first in the province to make this declaration. This was your promise to us, and future generations that we had turned a page. No longer would the moniker 'Gritty City' apply. We had the right to breathe clean air, and you had sworn to protect this right. Yet in a Spectator article from four days ago, we found out that downtown Hamilton has the worst air pollution in Ontario. The worst. In the substance of the declaration of our Right to a Healthy Environment, you pledged to support infrastructure projects that protect the environment, including air quality. You vowed to prioritize efficient public transit, cycling, and walking. And you have done that. You've substantially increased the number of bike lanes, you've invested in more walkable streets like Concession, brought in traffic calming measures, and for the past decade you've been planning and approving the development of the BLAST network. Very forward thinking councilors. We commend you and thank you. You responsibly fought to have this first stage of this LRT system paid for in full by the province, protecting against raising our property taxes. Waterloo had to subsidize their LRT with $285 million by raising their taxes 1.2 percent. They understood it was a good investment and were willing to pay. You understood LRT is a good investment, and you even had it paid for. We congratulate you. Eventually, the city's population will move quickly and cleanly through your planned BLAST grid of inter-connected LRTs, fed from outer areas by electric buses. This is visionary and the way we must proceed for our future growth, the quality of our air, and the health of our children. Hamilton was once called the 'Electric City'. Nicola Telsa brought AC current in to our city, the first in Canada, sparking the growth of industry and attracting companies such as Westinghouse, Proctor and Gamble, and International Harvester. We now need to attract the industry, innovation, and entrepreneurs that will fuel the greatest economic opportunity in the history of the human race - the conversion of fossil fuels to renewable electric. Electric. Hamilton was ahead of its time. And now we're getting back on track. Your progressive BLAST network vision sends a signal to the businesses and industry that we want to attract, that Hamilton understands the future. That the future is electric. That efficient, clean mass transportation is important to moving the people our growth will bring. There is a reason every major city in the world has some form of LRT along its main corridors. You've understood this, planned for this, and have taken very responsible steps to have this first leg of our LRT plan realized. We at Hamilton Blue Dot commend you. We thank you for honouring your commitment to protecting our Right to a Healthy Environment. Please keep up this good work. Hamilton's future is indeed, Electric. 0 Comments View Comments: Nested | Flat Post a Comment You must be logged in to comment.

The Gamble Building on Victoria Square will mark the milestone anniversary with a tea party, a talk and presentation, visits from school pupils and displays on Thursday November 3. A reading room in the Gamble Building in about 1900 The building was opened in November 1896 and still contains the town’s Central Library and local history archives. The landmark was the idea of the town’s first mayor, chemical magnate Sir David Gamble, who donated £30,000, a sum worth £3.57m today, to make the project a reality. Huge crowds lined the streets to see the Earl of Derby visit St Helens and to witness Sir David handing the finished building over to the borough. The 120th anniversary will be celebrated with a timeline wall display of features and people associated with the building and a case showing off to visitors the golden casket and freedom of the borough awarded to Sir David for his gift of the Gamble Institute. School pupils will browse original photographs, news cuttings and plans of the building and the local history room will have a talk by Pauline HUrst about the Gamble family, including their famous relatives in America involved with giant firm Proctor and Gamble. There will also be a tea party running throughout the day from 10am until 4pm. The building was originally created as a technical school to provide the advanced qualifications people working in local industries needed. It opened two years after plans were drawn up in 1894, with a library complete with ladies-only reading room on the ground floor, a basement devoted to manual training which included a complete metallurgical laboratory, and a first floor housing classrooms, lecture rooms and departments for cookery and laundry. Art and chemical departments were included on the second floor. The building remains a hub of learning and creativity today although some of its original Victorian rules, such as children under 12 being banned from entering the library or borrowing books there, are now long gone. The institute also honours Sir David with a prominent marble bust of him visible in the main library.

ALSO READ US stocks end in the red US stocks end in the red US stocks end in the red US stocks end in the red US stocks end in the red Lackluster spate of earnings and weak economic data affect momentum U.S. stocks finished lower on Tuesday, 25 October 2016 giving back some of the previous day's advance as worries about a lackluster spate of earnings and a slip in a reading of consumer confidence weighed on market sentiment. A drop in the price of oil below $50 a barrel, lingering uncertainty about the U.S. presidential election and growing expectations of a rate increase by the Federal Reserve, also contributed to the downbeat mood. The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 53.76 points, or 0.3%, at 18,169.27, as shares of Home Depot weighed on blue-chips with a 3.2% decline. Earlier, the average had been down as many as 71 points. The Nasdaq Composite Index gave up 26.45 points, or 0.5%, to wrap at 5,283.40. The S&P 500 declined by 8.17 points, or 0.4%, to 2,143.16. Nine of the 11 main sectors ended in the red. The consumer-discretionary closed off 1.2%, while materials lost 1%. Shares of Dow component 3M fell 2.9% after reporting earnings that beat Wall Street expectations, but the company posted sales that were flat relative to the prior year and reduced the top end of its yearly earnings forecast. Market participants have been wrestling with third-quarter earnings that have outperformed lowered expectations, but a number of companies have cut their annual outlooks, which has raised questions about future earnings. Investors were eager to find out the results from two of the tech giants this week, with Apple reporting after the closing bell on Tuesday. Traders continued to eye economic data for hints on the prospects for a Federal Reserve interest-rate increase before the end of the year. Higher rates tend to send investors away from precious metals into investments that carry a yield. A reading on consumer confidence Tuesday showed a decline to 98.6 in October, a three-month low, from 103.5 in September. The FHFA Housing Price Index for August rose 0.7%, which followed an increase of 0.5% in July. Separately, the Case-Shiller 20-city Home Price Index for August rose 5.1%, which fell in-line with the consensus. This followed the previous month's unrevised reading of 5.0%. Shares in Whirlpool dropped 11% after the appliance maker reported third-quarter profit and sales that missed expectations, and issued a downbeat outlook. Merck & Co. rose 2% after the drugmaker's third-quarter earnings and sales came in above expectations. Chemicals maker DuPont& Co. shares fell 0.7% despite the company raising its yearly profit forecast and better-than-expected quarterly earnings. The company is working on its merger with Dow Chemical. Procter & Gamble gained 3.4% after the consumer goods company reported earnings ahead of forecasts. Lockheed Martin shares jumped 7.4% after the aerospace company posted higher-than-expected revenue and hiked its dividend. Baker Hughes shares rallied 4.3% after the oil-field services company reported a narrower-than-expected loss. General Motors shares ended down 4.2% even as auto giant's quarterly profit doubled. GM also posted higher revenue on strong U.S. truck sales. But it signaled continued weakness in Europe because of the fallout from the U.K.'s pending exit from the European Union, or Brexit. Crude futures fell on Tuesday, 25 October 2016 with prices in New York settling below $50 a barrel for the first time in just over a week, pressured by the possibility that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries' plan to curb output will fail after Iraq signaled unwillingness to take part in the proposed deal. December West Texas Intermediate crude fell by 56 cents, or 1.1%, to settle at $49.96 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. That was the lowest settlement and first finish below $50 since 17 October 2016. OPEC members in late September reached a preliminary agreement to limit the group's daily production to between 32.5 million to 33 million barrels a day. Bullion prices ended higher at Comex on Tuesday, 25 october 2016. Gold futures settled Tuesday at their highest level in about three weeks, rebounding from the previous day's decline as uncertainty ahead of the U.S. presidential election, some weakness in the U.S. dollar and a fall in domestic equities boosted the metal's appeal. December gold rose $9.90, or 0.8%, to settle at $1,273.60 an ounce. Prices settled at their highest level since 3 October 2016. Prices are still down about 3.1% so far this month. December silver gained 17.6 cents, or 1%, to $17.78 an ounce. Treasuries finished on a mixed note with the short end of the curve underperforming. The yield on the 2-yr note rose two basis points to 0.86% while the yield on the benchmark 10-yr note ended down one basis point at 1.76%. Today's trading volume was below the average of 853 million as 819 million shares changed hands at the NYSE floor. Tomorrow's economic data will include the weekly MBA Mortgage Index and International Trade in Goods for September, which will be released at 7:00 ET and 8:30 ET, respectively. The day's data will be capped off with the 10:00 ET release of New Home Sales for September (consensus 610k).

ChartsValuation & Peer ComparisonCommunity Buzz Close ✕ By Siddharth Philip, P R Sanjai and George Smith Alexander | Bloomberg The agenda for Monday’s extraordinary board meeting at India’s largest conglomerate contained little hint of what was to come. Tata Sons directors were summoned to the group’s fabled Bombay House headquarters to discuss the sale of assets, its moribund UK steel business and the group’s legal wrangles with Japan’s NTT Docomo Inc., according to a person with knowledge of the events. But once the meeting started in the wood-paneled boardroom on the fourth floor, it took a different turn. Under a portrait of the formidable J R D Tata, the board wrested back chairmanship of the steel-to-software business empire for 78-year-old Ratan Tata, ousting his protege Cyrus Mistry, 48, in a coup that stunned India’s business community. Mistry said he was shocked at the nature of his dismissal, according to a letter he sent to the board, reported on by the Economic Times. The letter described the board meeting as illegal and invalid, the paper said. Yet Ratan Tata had met Mistry earlier on Monday to present him with options, according to three people with knowledge of the event. Moreover, the rift had been brewing for months, said people who work with senior Tata executives and asked not to be named because the matter is private. It was a clash of styles, a feeling that Mistry, handpicked by Tata, wasn’t adhering to the traditional values of a company that had previously been led by a person related to the Tata family. Key to the showdown was a $1.17 billion legal battle with former partner Docomo over an Indian telecom venture. Docomo is trying to enforce a London Court of International Arbitration decision ordering Tata Sons to pay the sum for failing to uphold a contract. That venture was created during Ratan Tata’s 21-year period at the helm, and Mistry’s handling of the matter was seen by some as an erosion of the Tata Sons ethic of honoring commitments, according to the people. “The biggest challenge for an organization is planning for succession, especially following the tenure of a very successful CEO,” said Vijay Govindarajan, a professor at Dartmouth University’s Tuck School of Business. “The current leadership crisis is an unwanted distraction.” Mistry’s handling of troubles at other group businesses were also causing concern, according to the people, including the break-up of Tata Steel’s European empire, which Ratan Tata helped acquire. Spokesmen for Ratan Tata and Mistry declined to comment. Yet if Mistry’s way of doing things was rankling the old guard, he also had successes in an increasingly difficult business climate. Ratan Tata had swelled group revenues more than 60-fold to $100 billion with a campaign of expansion abroad that included the troubled European steelmaker Corus Group Plc and marquee brands such as Land Rover, Jaguar, Tetley tea and New York’s Pierre hotel. With the slowdown in China dragging on global trade and Brexit concerns further damping European operations, Mistry was trying to unwind some of that growth and pay back part of the debt Tata had built up to pay for the acquisitions. And while the steel and power businesses were losing money, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd., the group’s largest unit, has pushed into cloud computing and digital services to weather lackluster global IT spending, beating analysts’ estimates in the process. "I am stunned,” said S. Manikutty, a former professor at the Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad, who closely tracks Indian conglomerates and family businesses. “It was completely unexpected because Mr. Mistry was trying to remove important cobwebs from the Tata stable.” That didn’t save him. The day after his ouster, the corridors of Bombay House, Tata Group’s austere headquarters for 92 years in downtown Mumbai, were quiet, with most staff still in shock at the news. Traffic jammed the street outside, while reporters, TV crews and onlookers thronged the building. Media Speculation As rumors flew and media speculation mounted, Ratan Tata called together the chief executives of the group’s businesses to calm the ship. There would be continuity in all branches of the business without any issues, he told them in a 25-minute gathering, according to an executive who was present. Tata said he was keen to honor decisions made by Mistry, the person said. To read a Gadfly column on the Tata ouster, click here Ratan Tata is the latest in a long line of so-called boomerang CEOs who retook control after stepping down or being ousted. The late Steve Jobs revived Apple Inc. after more than a decade in the wilderness, A. G. Lafley made a two-year return performance at Procter & Gamble Co., Howard Schultz came back to give Starbucks Corp. another shot, and Narayana Murthy made a brief return as executive chairman at Tata’s IT rival Infosys Ltd. Now Ratan Tata’s search for a successor is back where it started. After grooming Mistry for a year before he took over, Tata and four other prominent leaders -- Venu Srinivasan, Amit Chandra, Ronen Sen and Kumar Bhattacharyya -- are part of the panel formed to find a new chairman within four months. For a story on Ratan Tata’s investment after stepping down in 2012, click here “This will mean another period of uncertainty to Tata stakeholders,” said Morgen Witzel, author of “Tata: The Evolution of a Corporate Brand.” He called the pledge to find a new leader within four months, “a heroic undertaking, given how long it took them to choose Mr. Mistry in the first place.” Tata himself has said that it’s not easy to spot a true leader. At a meeting with young entrepreneurs in Singapore in late March, he was asked about the qualities that make a chief. He responded that it wasn’t easy to tell how someone would respond until they were in the job. “The final test is crisis that one faces,” he answered at the time, speaking generally. “Someone who deals with that crisis with his sleeves rolled up, as against those who hold on, is finally the mark of a real leader.” Stay on top of business news with The Economic Times App. Download it Now!

The Kuala Lumpur Composite Index remains just above the 1,675-point plateau, and the market is looking at another soft start on Wednesday. The global forecast for the Asian markets suggests mild consolidation thanks to weak earnings news and economic data, plus a decline in the price of crude oil. The European and U.S. markets were down and the Asian bourses figure to follow suit. The KLCI finished barely lower on Tuesday as losses from the plantation stocks and industrial issues were mitigated by support from the financial shares. For the day, the index eased 0.33 points or 0.02 percent to finish at 1,677.43 after trading between 1,673.18 and 1,677.44. Volume was 1.43 billion shares worth 1.8 billion ringgit. There were 421 decliners and 334 gainers, with 408 stocks finishing unchanged. Among the actives, MISC, Public Bank, Maxis and BAT all finished lower, while IHH Healthcare was unchanged and Sime Darby, Tenaga Nasional, Hong Leong Bank and Maybank all ended higher. The lead from Wall Street is soft as stocks moved lower on Tuesday, although the downside was fairly limited. The S&P 500 fell 8.17 points or 0.38 percent to 2,143.15, while the NASDAQ slid 26.43 points or 0.50 percent to 5,283.40 and the Dow lost 53.76 points or 0.30 percent to 18,169.27. The weakness came as traders reacted to the latest earnings news, with Sonic (SONC) reporting better than expected fiscal Q4 earnings but providing disappointing guidance. Also, Under Amour (UA) said its growth rate was slowing, while Procter & Gamble (PG) reported results that beat estimates. In economic news, the Conference Board noted a bigger than expected drop in consumer confidence in October. Falling crude oil prices also weighed as Dec.

The Taiwan Stock Exchange now rests just above the 9,385-point plateau, although the market is ripe for profit taking on Wednesday. The global forecast for the Asian markets suggests mild consolidation thanks to weak earnings news and economic data, plus a decline in the price of crude oil. The European and U.S. markets were down and the Asian bourses figure to follow suit. The TSE finished modestly higher on Tuesday following gains from the technology stocks and the financial shares. For the day, the index gained 63.15 points or 0.68 percent to finish at 9,385.65 after trading between 9,334.80 and 9,399.97 on turnover of 64.30 billion Taiwan dollars. Among the actives, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company climbed 1.05 percent, while AU Optronics perked 1.56 percent, Largan Precision tumbled 1.46 percent, Hon Hai Precision advanced 1.78 percent, Pegatron jumped 1.92 percent, MediaTek spiked 2.10 percent, Formosa Petrochemical surged 3.40 percent, Fubon Financial collected 1.00 percent and Cathay Financial added 0.37 percent. The lead from Wall Street is soft as stocks moved lower on Tuesday, although the downside was fairly limited. The S&P 500 fell 8.17 points or 0.38 percent to 2,143.15, while the NASDAQ slid 26.43 points or 0.50 percent to 5,283.40 and the Dow lost 53.76 points or 0.30 percent to 18,169.27. The weakness came as traders reacted to the latest earnings news, with Sonic (SONC) reporting better than expected fiscal Q4 earnings but providing disappointing guidance. Also, Under Amour (UA) said its growth rate was slowing, while Procter & Gamble (PG) reported results that beat estimates. In economic news, the Conference Board noted a bigger than expected drop in consumer confidence in October. Falling crude oil prices also weighed as Dec.

Tata Sons Ltd. directors were summoned to the group’s fabled Bombay House headquarters to discuss the sale of assets, its moribund U.K. steel business and the group’s legal wrangles with Japan’s NTT Docomo Inc., according to a person with knowledge of the events. But once the meeting started in the wood-paneled boardroom on the fourth floor, it took a different turn. Under a portrait of the formidable J R D Tata, the board wrested back chairmanship of the steel-to-software business empire for 78-year-old Ratan Tata, ousting his protege Cyrus Mistry, 48, in a coup that stunned India’s business community. Mistry said he was shocked at the nature of his dismissal and described the board meeting as illegal and invalid, according to an e-mail he sent to Tata directors. Ratan Tata had met Mistry earlier on Monday to present him with options, according to three people with knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be identified because the meeting was private. "I have to say that the Board of Directors has not covered itself with glory," Mistry said in the letter, a copy of which was seen by Bloomberg News. "To ‘replace’ your Chairman without so much as a word of explanation and without affording him an opportunity to defending himself in a summary manner must be unique in the annals of corporate history." In the e-mail, Mistry also warned that the tea-to-software giant may face 1.18 trillion rupees ($18 billion) in writedowns because of five unprofitable businesses he inherited. The rift had been brewing for months, said people who work with senior Tata executives and asked not to be named because the matter is private. It was a clash of styles, a feeling that Mistry, handpicked by Tata, wasn’t adhering to the traditional values of a company that had previously been led by a person related to the Tata family. Key to the showdown was a $1.17 billion legal battle with former partner Docomo over an Indian telecom venture. Docomo is trying to enforce a London Court of International Arbitration decision ordering Tata Sons to pay the sum for failing to uphold a contract. That venture was created during Ratan Tata’s 21-year period at the helm, and Mistry’s handling of the matter was seen by some as an erosion of the Tata Sons ethic of honoring commitments, according to the people. “The biggest challenge for an organization is planning for succession, especially following the tenure of a very successful CEO,” said Vijay Govindarajan, a professor at Dartmouth University’s Tuck School of Business. “The current leadership crisis is an unwanted distraction.” Mistry’s handling of troubles at other group businesses were also causing concern, according to the people, including the break-up of Tata Steel’s European empire, which Ratan Tata helped acquire. Spokesmen for Ratan Tata and Mistry declined to comment. For a QuickTake Q&A on Tata Group, click here. Yet if Mistry’s way of doing things was rankling the old guard, he also had successes in an increasingly difficult business climate. Ratan Tata had swelled group revenues more than 60-fold to $100 billion with a campaign of expansion abroad that included the troubled European steelmaker Corus Group Plc and marquee brands such as Land Rover, Jaguar, Tetley tea and New York’s Pierre hotel. With the slowdown in China dragging on global trade and Brexit concerns further damping European operations, Mistry was trying to unwind some of that growth and pay back part of the debt Tata had built up to pay for the acquisitions. And while the steel and power businesses were losing money, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd., the group’s largest unit, has pushed into cloud computing and digital services to weather lackluster global IT spending, beating analysts’ estimates in the process. "I am stunned,” said S. Manikutty, a former professor at the Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad, who closely tracks Indian conglomerates and family businesses. “It was completely unexpected because Mr. Mistry was trying to remove important cobwebs from the Tata stable.” That didn’t save him. The day after his ouster, the corridors of Bombay House, Tata Group’s austere headquarters for 92 years in downtown Mumbai, were quiet, with most staff still in shock at the news. Traffic jammed the street outside, while reporters, TV crews and onlookers thronged the building. Media Speculation As rumors flew and media speculation mounted, Ratan Tata called together the chief executives of the group’s businesses to calm the ship. There would be continuity in all branches of the business without any issues, he told them in a 25-minute gathering, according to an executive who was present. Tata said he was keen to honor decisions made by Mistry, the person said. To read a Gadfly column on the Tata ouster, click here Ratan Tata is the latest in a long line of so-called boomerang CEOs who retook control after stepping down or being ousted. The late Steve Jobs revived Apple Inc. after more than a decade in the wilderness, A. G. Lafley made a two-year return performance at Procter & Gamble Co., Howard Schultz came back to give Starbucks Corp. another shot, and Narayana Murthy made a brief return as executive chairman at Tata’s IT rival Infosys Ltd. Now Ratan Tata’s search for a successor is back where it started. After grooming Mistry for a year before he took over, Tata and four other prominent leaders -- Venu Srinivasan, Amit Chandra, Ronen Sen and Kumar Bhattacharyya -- are part of the panel formed to find a new chairman within four months. For a story on Ratan Tata’s investment after stepping down in 2012, click here “This will mean another period of uncertainty to Tata stakeholders,” said Morgen Witzel, author of “Tata: The Evolution of a Corporate Brand.” He called the pledge to find a new leader within four months, “a heroic undertaking, given how long it took them to choose Mr. Mistry in the first place.” Tata himself has said that it’s not easy to spot a true leader. At a meeting with young entrepreneurs in Singapore in late March, he was asked about the qualities that make a chief. He responded that it wasn’t easy to tell how someone would respond until they were in the job. “The final test is crisis that one faces,” he answered at the time, speaking generally. “Someone who deals with that crisis with his sleeves rolled up, as against those who hold on, is finally the mark of a real leader.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

The Hang Seng Index settled just above the 23,565-point plateau, and the losses may accelerate on Wednesday. The global forecast for the Asian markets suggests mild consolidation thanks to weak earnings news and economic data, plus a decline in the price of crude oil. The European and U.S. markets were down and the Asian bourses figure to follow suit. The Hang Seng finished slightly lower on Tuesday as losses from the financials and oil companies were tempered by support from the casinos. For the day, the index lost 38.97 points or 0.17 percent to finish at 23,565.11 after trading between 23,506.64 and 23,631.34. Among the actives, Belle International Holdings plummeted 9.14 percent, while Galaxy Entertainment surged 2.78 percent, Sands China spiked 1.59 percent, CITIC skidded 1.04 percent, Bank of China shed 0.89 percent, Industrial and Commercial bank of China retreated 0.42 percent, HSBC eased 0.25 percent, China Resources Land advanced 0.90 percent, Ping An picked up 0.85 percent and China Petroleum and Chemical (Sinopec) skidded 0.67 percent. The lead from Wall Street is soft as stocks moved lower on Tuesday, although the downside was fairly limited. The S&P 500 fell 8.17 points or 0.38 percent to 2,143.15, while the NASDAQ slid 26.43 points or 0.50 percent to 5,283.40 and the Dow lost 53.76 points or 0.30 percent to 18,169.27. The weakness came as traders reacted to the latest earnings news, with Sonic (SONC) reporting better than expected fiscal Q4 earnings but providing disappointing guidance. Also, Under Amour (UA) said its growth rate was slowing, while Procter & Gamble (PG) reported results that beat estimates. In economic news, the Conference Board noted a bigger than expected drop in consumer confidence in October. Falling crude oil prices also weighed as Dec.

Boeing, Coca-Cola and dozens of others report earnings ahead of the opening bell. Apple, which reported after the bell Tuesday, was a negative factor for stock futures in late trading. The stock was down around 3 percent after it reported a decline in profits and revenues. Apple, the biggest U.S. company, can easily impact sentiment. "I think it's psychologically very important," said Don Townswick, director of equities at Conning. "Apple earnings are almost more important for the overall market than they are for Apple." Apple net income slid nearly 20 percent to $9 billion, but earnings per share beat forecasts by a penny at $1.67. The market focused on revenues of $46.9 billion, just below consensus of $46.94 billion. Sales of the company's iPhone were 45.5 million, more than the 44.8 million expected but shipments of Mac computers were below consensus. There is also oil inventory data Wednesday morning at 10:30 a.m. EDT, and if American Petroleum Institute's late Tuesday report is a guide, there could be a bigger-than-expected build in inventories, a bearish trend. The API data showed a 4.8 million barrel increase in crude supply in the U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude sank closer to $49, after earlier closing down 1.1 percent at $49.96 per barrel, below $50 for the first time since Oct. 17. "I was expecting 2.4 million. It looks like imports rebounded by a good amount," said John Kilduff of Again Capital. Oil was lower earlier Tuesday on increasing doubt that OPEC and other oil producers will be able to make a deal to curb production and stabilize oil prices. "At some point you had to expect the market to call them out on what they're doing or not doing. Their deeds again just don't match their words, almost to a member. At some point, the rhetoric game gets played out," said Kilduff. He noted there were reports that an unnamed Russian official said that country would not cut production. There is also a $34 billion five-year note auction Wednesday, and it's being watched carefully after a soft two-year auction Tuesday. Strategists said some of the weakness — and rise in rates — had to do with anticipation about the Fed's November meeting next week. "How much do they emphasize a December rate hike? I think it's pretty much priced in and barring a disaster, they're looking for that one rate hike in 2016," said Cantor Fitzgerald rate strategist Justin Lederer. The market expects the Fed to stay on hold at the November meeting but to hike for the second time in 10 years in December, if the economy remains on track. "I don't think you're really going to see rates spike higher on this. It's not like it was a year ago when you had December hike, and the Fed was looking for four this year," he said. "Here we are and the trajectory is very shallow. Before an election, I don't think they want to see anything crazy going on, before the election." Next week's Fed meeting is six days before the presidential election, and that's one reason economists expect the Fed to wait until December. "I think the Fed being where they are now has hurt economic activity. They've sapped confidence," said Townswick. "I hope they start to raise and after the election, they don't have to be accused of politicking or either being accused of causing a recession or causing a candidate to lose." Meanwhile, earnings have been a mixed catalyst with Procter & Gamble, for instance, jumping on its report Tuesday, but fellow Dow stock 3M fell sharply on its earnings. Besides Boeing and P&G, earnings expected Wednesday morning include CNBC parent Comcast, Norfolk Southern, Northrop Grumman, GlaxoSmithKline, Ingersoll-Rand, Nasdaq, State Street, Southwest Air, Nintendo, WR Grace, Bayer and Boston Scientific. Texas Instruments, Tesla, F5 Networks, VMWare, Shutterfly, Rent-A-Center, Ocwen, Raymond James, Buffalo Wild Wings, Groupon, Samsung and dozens of others report after the closing bell. Earnings are expected to grow by 1.7 percent for the third quarter, based on results of S&P 500 companies so far and estimates, according to Thomson Reuters. Revenue growth is expected at 2.7 percent. Of the 150 S&P companies reporting as of Tuesday morning, 75 percent beat earnings estimates and 59 percent have beaten revenue estimates. There is also international trade at 8:30 a.m. EDT, Services PMI at 9:45 a.m. and new home sales at 10 a.m. Patti DommCNBC Executive News Editor SHOW COMMENTS Please add a username to view or add comments Public Username for Commenting JOIN THE DISCUSSION To learn more about how we use your information, please read our Privacy Policy and Terms of Service.

The S&P 500 dropped around 0.4 percent, with consumer discretionary falling 1.2 percent to lead decliners. The Nasdaq composite underperformed, falling about 0.6 percent.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermidMore By Rodrigo Campos NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks slipped from two-week highs on Tuesday as results and forecasts from companies in sectors including housing and consumer products failed to live up to expectations. Apple , the largest U.S. company by market capitalization, posted after the bell better-than-expected iPhone sales that however continued a declining trend and shares fell about 2 percent, briefly dragging S&P 500 futures to session lows. During the regular session, Whirlpool , down 10.8 percent to $152.09, cited soft demand as it posted lower-than-expected earnings and gave an underwhelming forecast. Sherwin Williams' outlook also disappointed Wall Street and shares fell 10.9 percent to $247.61. Both were an indication to some analysts that the housing sector may be cooling. "Lackluster results from Whirlpool and Sherwin Williams may indicate a slowing in the housing cycle," said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. She said those results could be weighing on Home Depot , which was down 3.5 percent at $123.34 as the largest points decliner on the S&P 500. Lowes Cos fell 3.5 percent to $68.47. Consumer products company Procter & Gamble rose 3.4 percent to $86.97 after reporting a better-than-expected quarterly profit, while sportswear maker Under Armour fell 13.2 percent to $32.89 after it reported its slowest quarterly sales growth in six years. “We had a rally (Monday) and haven’t been able to sustain it, due to weaker-than-expected numbers from some names,” said Peter Jankovskis, co-chief investment officer at OakBrook Investments in Lisle, Illinois, calling the day’s earnings a "mixed bag." Overall, annualized third-quarter earnings from S&P 500 companies are expected to have risen 1.7 percent, effectively putting an end to an earnings recession, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Of the 150 companies that have reported so far, 75.3 percent have beaten analyst expectations, above the long-term average of 63.5 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> fell 53.76 points, or 0.3 percent, to 18,169.27, the S&P 500 <.SPX> lost 8.17 points, or 0.38 percent, to 2,143.16 and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> dropped 26.43 points, or 0.5 percent, to 5,283.40. Futures were also pressured after the bell by a late decline in oil prices after data showed a bigger-than-expected build in U.S. crude inventories. 3M fell 2.9 percent to $166.23 after the maker of Scotch tape and Post-it notes trimmed its full-year revenue and earnings forecasts for the second time. Caterpillar lost 1.8 percent after a downbeat forecast, while General Motors fell 4.2 percent amid fears regarding future profits. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.53-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.17-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 11 new 52-week highs and nine new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 67 new highs and 73 new lows. About 6.39 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, in line with the 6.4 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

Whirlpool cited soft demand as it posted lower-than- expected earnings and gave an underwhelming guidance, while Sherwin Williams' outlook was also a disappointment for Wall Street, an indication to some analysts that the housing sector may be cooling. "Lackluster results from Whirlpool and Sherwin Williams may indicate a slowing in the housing cycle," said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. She said those results could be weighing on Home Depot , which was down 3.3 percent at $123.60 as the largest points decliner on the S&P 500. 3M fell 3 percent to $166.14 after the maker of Scotch tape and Post-it notes trimmed its full-year revenue and earnings forecasts for the second time. But overall, annualized third-quarter earnings from S&P 500 companies are expected to have risen 1.7 percent, effectively putting an end to an earnings recession, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Of the 150 companies that have reported so far, 75.3 percent have beaten analyst expectations, above the long-term average of 63.5 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average was off 45.71 points, or 0.25 percent, to 18,177.32, the S&P 500 lost 7.49 points, or 0.35 percent, to 2,143.84 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 28.13 points, or 0.53 percent, to 5,281.70. Caterpillar slipped 1.7 percent after giving a downbeat forecast, while General Motors fell 4.3 percent amid fears regarding future profits. Consumer products company Procter & Gamble rose 3.9 percent to $87.35 after reporting a better-than-expected quarterly profit, while sportswear maker Under Armour fell 13.1 percent to $32.94 after it reported its slowest quarterly sales growth in six years. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.51-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.16-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 11 new 52-week highs and 8 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 57 new highs and 71 new lows.

The stock was the biggest drag on the Dow. Whirlpool fell 10.5 percent to $152.60 after the home appliances maker's revenue took a hit from a strong dollar. The dollar index was little changed at 98.69 against a basket of major currencies, after hitting its highest level since early February. A strong dollar could dent the earnings of large multinationals. "We've had some mixed earnings today and the market right now is digesting earnings and positioning itself ahead of the Fed meeting next week," said Jeff Zipper, managing director for investments at Private Client Reserve at U.S. Bank in Palm Beach, Florida. Annualized third-quarter earnings from S&P 500 companies are expected to have risen 1.7 percent, following four quarters of contraction, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Of the 150 companies that have reported so far, 75.3 percent have beaten analyst expectations, above the long-term average of 63.5 percent. "There is certainly some uncertainty around the election and the Fed and Brexit too," said Zipper. While investors aren't expecting the Fed to raise rates when it meets next week, they will be looking for clues regarding the trajectory of future hikes. Traders are pricing in a 74 percent chance for a December hike, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool. At 12:44 p.m. ET (1644 GMT), the Dow Jones industrial average was down 48.21 points, or 0.26 percent, at 18,174.82, the S&P 500 was down 7.94 points, or 0.37 percent, at 2,143.39 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 28.71 points, or 0.54 percent, at 5,281.12. Nine of the 11 major S&P sectors were lower, with the materials index falling 0.98 percent. Sherwin-Williams fell 10 percent and weighed the most on the index. The consumer discretionary sector also fell 1.09 percent as poor results from Sherwin-Williams weighed on Home Depot. Home Depot weighed the most on the S&P. Caterpillar slipped 1.6 percent after giving a downbeat forecast, while General Motors fell 4.2 percent amid fears regarding future profits. Procter & Gamble rose 3.8 percent to $87.32 after reporting a better-than-expected quarterly profit. Apple, which is scheduled to report results after the close of the bell, slipped 0.15 percent to $117.47. Under Armour fell 13.9 percent to $32.58 after the sportswear maker reported its slowest quarterly sales growth in six years. Oil prices fell 1 percent, with U.S. crude breaking below $50 per barrel for a second straight day ahead of weekly data that could show a build in domestic inventories. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 1,828 to 1,039. On the Nasdaq, 1,894 issues fell and 789 advanced. The S&P 500 index showed 10 new 52-week highs and eight new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 50 new highs and 55 new lows.

The stock was the biggest drag on the S&P and Dow. Whirlpool fell 11.2 per cent to US$151.37 after the home appliances maker’s revenue took a hit from a strong dollar. The dollar index was up 0.26 per cent at 99.02 against a basket of major currencies, its highest level since early February. A strong dollar could dent the earnings of large multinationals. “We’ve had some mixed earnings today and the market right now is digesting earnings and positioning itself ahead of the Fed meeting next week,” said Jeff Zipper, managing director for investments at Private Client Reserve at US Bank in Palm Beach, Florida. Annualised third-quarter earnings from S&P 500 companies are expected to have risen 1.7 per cent, following four quarters of contraction, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Of the 150 companies that have reported so far, 75.3 per cent have beaten analyst expectations, above the long-term average of 63.5 per cent. “There is certainly some uncertainty around the election and the Fed and Brexit too,” said Zipper. While investors aren’t expecting the Fed to raise rates when it meets next week, they will be looking for clues regarding the trajectory of future hikes. Traders are pricing in a 74 per cent chance for a December hike, according to CME Group’s FedWatch tool. At 11:05am ET, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 32.12 points, or 0.18 per cent, at 18,190.91, the S&P 500 was down 6.02 points, or 0.28 per cent, at 2,145.31 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 17.97 points, or 0.34 per cent, at 5,291.86. Nine of the 11 major S&P sectors were lower, with the materials index’s 1.03 per cent fall leading the decliners. Sherwin-Williams fell 10 per cent and weighed the most on the index. The consumer discretionary sector also fell 0.94 per cent as poor results from Sherwin-Williams weighed on Home Depot and Lowe’s. Apple, which is scheduled to report results after the close of the bell, slipped 0.12 per cent to US$117.49. Procter & Gamble rose 4.5 per cent to US$87.89 after reporting a better-than-expected quarterly profit. Oil prices nudged down, retreating from positive territory as traders digested comments from Opec states about the prospects of an output cut and ahead of US crude inventory data. Under Armour fell 13.9 per cent to US$32.58 after the sportswear maker reported its slowest quarterly sales growth in six years. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 1,841 to 955. On the Nasdaq, 1,762 issues fell and 750 advanced. The S&P 500 index showed 10 new 52-week highs and seven new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 48 new highs and 36 new lows. — Reuters                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Five ways Indians are dodging ‘black money’ crackdown Asia to narrow trade focus as protectionism rises, say analysts Malaysia’s central bank says will no longer tolerate ringgit trade in NDF market Palm oil celebrates centennial, output doubles every 10 years TPP, RCEP, FTAAP: A user’s guide to alphabet soup of trade deals Foreign banks shaken by Malaysia's move to halt currency slide Bank Negara instructs foreign banks to refrain from offshore ringgit trading, sources claim Malaysia’s central bank says will no longer tolerate ringgit trade in NDF market Malaysia Airlines mulling purchase of 25 widebody jets next year Ex-Valeant executive, ex-pharmacy CEO charged for fraud scheme Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: ‘Tensions’ likely under President-elect Trump, Obama says Reuters Video: Trump says ‘you will hear some things tomorrow’ MMOTV: Mahathir, Siti Hasmah head to KLCC by car MMOTV: Mahathir, Siti Hasmah head to KLCC by car MMOTV: Red Shirts heckle yellow-shirted Bersih participants Ah Beng reviews iguana’s epic escape from snakes (WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE) Related Articles Wall Street slips, led by healthcare decline Wall Street flat at the open; Nasdaq hits record high S&P 500 rises to near record after Yellen as treasuries retreat (VIDEO) Wall St edges up, waiting for signs from Yellen Oil prices fall on US crude stock build, Opec remains in focus Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2016 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

A drop in the price of oil below $50 a barrel, lingering uncertainty about the U.S. presidential election and growing expectations of a rate increase by the Federal Reserve, also contributed to the downbeat mood. The confidence of Americans in the U.S. economy fell in October to a three-month low just ahead of the Election Day showdown on Nov. 8 between Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton and GOP nominee Donald Trump, with more consumers saying jobs are harder to find. See: Corporate insiders have lost appetite for their own stocks The S&P 500 SPX, -0.24%  declined by 8.17 points, or 0.4%, to 2,143.16, after being down nearly 10 points earlier. Nine of the 11 main sectors ended in the red. The consumer-discretionary closed off 1.2%, while materials lost 1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.19%  declined 53.76 points, or 0.3%, at 18,169.27, as shares of Home Depot Inc. HD, -0.47%  weighed on blue-chips with a 3.2% decline. Earlier, the average had been down as many as 71 points. Shares of Dow component 3M Co. MMM, +0.11% fell 2.9% after reporting earnings that beat Wall Street expectations, but the St. Paul, Minn.-based company posted sales that were flat relative to the prior year and reduced the top end of its yearly earnings forecast. The share decline in Home Depot and 3M Co. wiped a combined 64 points from Dow industrials. The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -0.23%  gave up 26.45 points, or 0.5%, to wrap at 5,283.40. Tuesday’s retreat in equities was to be expected as Monday’s gains were primarily the result of merger enthusiasm, said Karyn Cavanaugh, senior market strategist at Voya Financial. “Deals tend to boost investor confidence especially after a dry spell,” Cavanaugh said. “So, we were just setting ourselves up for a bit of a letdown.” Market participants have been wrestling with third-quarter earnings that have outperformed lowered expectations, but a number of companies have cut their annual outlooks, which has raised questions about future earnings. Cavanaugh said the market is still focused on earnings and with about 30% of the S&P 500 having reported, chances are good that third-quarter earnings could end more than a year of quarterly earnings declines. Investors are eager to find out the results from two of the tech giants this week, with Apple reporting after the closing bell on Tuesday. Analysts expect to see Apple Inc. AAPL, +0.10%  report earnings at the high-end of its fourth-quarter forecast, aided by the iPhone 7 launch and new customers switching from Android after Samsung Electronics’ exploding Note 7 troubles. However, analysts are also projecting the third-straight quarterly decline in iPhone unit sales. Economic data: Consumer confidence dropped to 98.6 this month from 103.5 in September, the privately run Conference Board said Tuesday. The decline was well below Wall Street expectations. Separately, U.S. home prices rose in August, and were up 5.1% year-over-year as tight inventories continued to drive prices higher, according to the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller 20-City index. Corporates: Shares in Whirlpool WHR, -1.36% dropped 11% after the appliance maker reported third-quarter profit and sales that missed expectations, and issued a downbeat outlook. Merck & Co. shares MRK, -1.32%  rose 2% after the drugmaker’s third-quarter earnings and sales came in above expectations. Chemicals maker DuPont& Co. DD, -0.48%  shares fell 0.7% despite the company raising its yearly profit forecast and better-than-expected quarterly earnings. The company is working on its merger with Dow Chemical Co. DOW, -0.24% Watch: Do lawsuits drive innovation in chemical industry? Procter & Gamble Co. PG, -1.29%  gained 3.4% after the consumer goods company reported earnings ahead of forecasts. Lockheed Martin Corp. LMT, -0.07%  shares jumped 7.4% after the aerospace company posted higher-than-expected revenue and hiked its dividend. Baker Hughes Inc. BHI, -0.60%  shares rallied 4.3% after the oil-field services company reported a narrower-than-expected loss. General Motors Co. GM, -1.26% shares ended down 4.2% even as auto giant’s quarterly profit doubled. GM also posted higher revenue on strong U.S. truck sales. But it signaled continued weakness in Europe because of the fallout from the U.K.’s pending exit from the European Union, or Brexit. Freeport-McMoRan Inc. FCX, -0.51%  rallied 3.6% despite reporting profit and revenue that missed analysts’ expectations on Tuesday. Under Armour Inc.’s class A shares UA, -4.21% shares plunged 13.2% after the company issued a profit warning. ItThe decline came even as the athletic gear maker reported a 28% rise in third-quarter profit and an expansion of its market share, but those results were overshadowed by its warning. Nielsen Holdings PLC NLSN, -1.77%  shares dropped nearly 17% after the media-ratings company reported a slip in profit because of higher restructuring charges. Other markets: Oil futures CLZ6, +0.35%  settled down 1.1% at $49.96 a barrel while gold futures GCZ6, -0.79% settled up 0.8% at $1,273.60 an ounce. The ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY, +0.39%  tilted lower after an earlier gain. European stocks SXXP, -0.36%  pared earlier gains and were mostly lower and Asian shares were mixed following data that pointed to a slowdown for South Korea’s economy. —Carla Mozee in London contributed to this article.
