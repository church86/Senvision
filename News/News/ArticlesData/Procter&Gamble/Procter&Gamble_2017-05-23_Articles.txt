College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: 3 Top Dividend Stocks in the Dentistry Industry Looking for top dividend stocks in the dentistry industry? Check out Patterson Companies, Procter & Gamble, and Johnson & Johnson. Keith Speights (TMFFishBiz) May 23, 2017 at 5:42PM If you like to put your money where your mouth is, there's probably no better (or more literal) way to do so than to invest in stocks that focus on dentistry. But if you also like to get money back in the form of dividends, there aren't too many choices available among dental stocks. The three top dividend stocks in the dentistry industry are Patterson Companies (NASDAQ:PDCO), Zimmer Biomet Holdings (NYSE:ZBH), and Danaher (NYSE:DHR). But two of these, Zimmer Biomet and Danaher, pay out only small dividends. However, if you expand your definition of "dentistry industry" to include dental-care products like toothpaste and dental floss, several dividend stocks can be added to the list; Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL) rank at the top. Here's how these stocks compare, and which stand out as the best dividend stocks in dentistry. Image source: Getty Images. The core dentistry stocks Patterson, Zimmer Biomet, and Danaher all sell products directly to the core dentistry market. Patterson is a distributor of dental supplies. Zimmer Biomet makes dental implants and prosthetics. Danaher develops and markets several dental products, including implants, prosthetics, orthodontic bracket systems, and endodontic systems. None of these companies focuses exclusively on the dentistry industry, though. Patterson generates about 46% of its total revenue from its dental segment, with the remainder coming from its animal-health business. Zimmer Biomet makes a little less than 6% of its total sales from its dental products, generating most of its revenue from knee- and hip-replacement products. Dental products make up roughly 16% of Danaher's total sales, with the company's life sciences and diagnostics businesses ranking as its top moneymakers. The best dividend stock among the three is clearly Patterson: Its dividend yield currently stands at 2.43%. Patterson's dividend payout ratio is a healthy 52%, which indicates the company should be able to increase its dividend in the future. Zimmer Biomet, on the other hand, has a dividend yield of only 0.82%, and Danaher's dividend yield of 0.68% is even lower. Both companies, though, should be able to roll out dividend hikes if they choose to do so. Zimmer Biomet currently uses 39% of its earnings to fund the dividend program, while Danaher uses less than 19% of its earnings to pay out dividends. The dental-care stocks Procter & Gamble's Crest and Oral-B products generate much of the company's sales in the healthcare segment. Johnson & Johnson's oral-care segment consists entirely of its Listerine products, including mouthwash, toothpaste, and dental floss. Colgate-Palmolive is known for its Colgate toothpaste brand. As is the case with Patterson, Zimmer Biomet, and Danaher, these dental-care stocks make most of their revenue outside of the dental industry. P&G makes 60% of its total revenue from fabric- and home-care products such as Tide and Cascade, and baby, feminine, and family care products including Pampers, Tampax, and Bounty. Prescription drugs are the top revenue generator for Johnson & Johnson. Colgate-Palmolive's oral-care products generate less than half of the company's total revenue, with its personal-care, home-care, and pet-nutrition products contributing the rest of its revenue. Procter & Gamble's dividend yield of 3.2% ranks as the highest of the three stocks. Johnson & Johnson's dividend currently yields 2.65%. Colgate-Palmolive's dividend yield stands at 2.15%. P&G has a dividend payout ratio of nearly 75%. J&J is using a relatively low 54% of earnings to fund its dividend program. Colgate-Palmolive has a similar payout ratio of 56%. Best of the best Neither Zimmer Biomet nor Danaher is a bad stock, but their dividends simply aren't high enough to make either attractive to dividend-seeking investors. That leaves Patterson as the top dividend stock from the core dentistry group. Procter & Gamble, Johnson & Johnson, and Colgate-Palmolive are all Dividend Aristocrats and therefore great dividend picks. None of the companies' payout ratios disqualify them, so that leaves yield as the deciding factor as to which are the best. Therefore, Patterson, Procter & Gamble, and Johnson & Johnson take the top spots. If I could only pick one of these stocks, I'd go with Procter & Gamble. Not only does P&G have the highest yield of these three finalists, but the company has also increased its dividend for 60 consecutive years -- longer even than J&J's impressive 54-year streak.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 23 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman American Forest Foundation, International Paper, Procter & Gamble and 3M Announce Carolinas Working Forest Conservation Collaborative DETROIT–(BUSINESS WIRE)–American Forest Foundation (AFF), International Paper, The Procter & Gamble Company (P&G) and 3M Company announced today the formation of the Carolinas Working Forest Conservation Collaborative a joint initiative in the Coastal Carolinas Plain to educate and engage family woodland owners in sustainable forestry, forest certification, the enhancement of habitat for at-risk species, and the conservation of bottomland hardwood forests. “There is a misconception that you cannot have both paper products and habitat from the same forest, however we have found that wood and wildlife can go hand-in-hand when family woodland owners are sustainably managing, said Paul DeLong, Vice President of Conservation for AFF. “International Paper, P&G and 3M have all shown a great commitment to responsible forestry, making them strong partners in our efforts to increase the number of landowners actively managing their land for wildlife, while providing sustainably produced wood supplies.” Together, International Paper, P&G and 3M are providing a total of $285,000 over a three-year period to AFF in support of their work to implement sustained and strategic landowner engagement efforts in North Carolina, including Columbus, Bladen, Robeson, Cumberland, Pender, Johnston counties and South Carolina, including Horry, Florence, and surrounding counties. “P&G is committed to sourcing 100% of our raw paper materials from responsibly managed forests,” says Tonia Elrod, director of sustainability & product stewardship for P&G Family Care brands. “To help us meet this goal, it is important for us to invest in partnerships with likeminded companies to increase responsible forestry practices and landowner certification while allowing us to still deliver the same superior product experience our consumers expect.” The Carolinas Working Forests Conservation Collaborative aims to: Increase awareness and understanding of the importance of sustainable forestry and active management among 30,000 woodland owners, who collectively own 2.4 million acres of forestland in the Carolina Coastal Plains region. Work with at least 450 landowners across 36,500 acres in the project counties to connect them with technical assistance and resources to get them started in forest management. Engage at least 160 woodland owners within the project area to enhance, restore or expand bottomland hardwood forests and quality habitat for at-risk species on at least 13,000 acres. Certify at least 120 landowners in a recognized forest certification standard. “At 3M, we drive both business growth and positive societal impact through purposeful partnerships,” says Jean Bennington Sweeney, 3M’s Chief Sustainability Officer. “We depend on committed landowners to provide sustainable, responsibly harvested wood fiber to our suppliers for products and packaging used in our brands like Post-it® Notes, Scotch® Tapes, FiltreteTM Filters, Scotch-Brite® Scrubbers and others. The sustainable practices this project enables will provide lasting benefits to landowners, forests, and our business.” Families and individuals own more than one-third of the forests across the U.S., which is more than corporations or the government. Across the South, 87 percent of family forest owners cite wildlife as a top reason they own land, yet most lack the technical skills and resources to manage. But those that do currently harvest or thin their forests are doing more for wildlife thanks to their relationships with foresters and other experts. Across the forest products supply chain, more than 50 percent of the wood supply comes from family-owned land. “Our entire business depends on the sustainability of forests,” said Sophie Beckham, International Paper Natural Capital Stewardship Manager. “We are thrilled to team up with organizations that share our goals in responsible forest management. Through this collaborative we will continue to promote responsible forest stewardship and ensure healthy and productive forest ecosystems for future generations.” About the American Forest Foundation The American Forest Foundation (AFF), a forest conservation organization, works on the ground with families, teachers and elected officials to promote stewardship and protect our nation’s forest heritage. A commitment to the next generation unites our nationwide network of forest owners and teachers working to keep our forests healthy and our children well-prepared for the future they will inherit.

Crowd sentiment at the time of the downgrade was still generally positive, with 71 percent of Vetr user ratings bullish. The consumer staples company's share price experienced a steep downturn after delivering a mixed earnings report late in April that showed the company exceeding analyst EPS estimates by two cents but missing sales estimate for the third quarter by about $105 million. Since then, the stock has dropped nearly 4.5 percent to about $86. Learn how crowdsourced ratings could help you time the market. Currently, the Vetr crowd's average target price for Procter & Gamble is up at $88.18, which is still below the average analyst target price of $90.57.

The Internet is Freaking Out Over This Tea That Accidentally... StyleCaster 101 Beauty Tips Everyone Should Know Facebook Pinterest Twitter Tumblr 0 byRachel Adler 7153 Shares 22 hours ago There are about a million beauty tips floating around out there on the internet—but that definitely doesn’t mean we should be following every single one of them. A YouTube or Instagram account does not a beauty expert make, but when working makeup artists, hairstylists, skincare gurus and beauty editors are offering up advice, you better believe we’re listening! From secrets about how to style your hair without heat to brilliant ways to fix a broken compact case, the more beauty tips you have in your arsenal, the better you’ll be prepared to handle every situation thrown at you. Here are the things we think everyone should know. 101. “Always keep your summer makeup minimal. Minimal and sheer makeup is the way to go when it’s hot and muggy outside.” — Mary Greenwell, celebrity makeup artist 100. “The best thing to do when you go to a makeup counter is be armed with what it is you want to do.”— Raychel Wade, founder of Cheek to Chic and La Prairie’s colour ambassador Credit: Instagram | @theskinnyconfidential 99. Use excess eye cream on cuticles. The more you hydrate your cuticles, the stronger your nails will be. 98. For smudge-proof eye makeup, take blotting tissue to remove any oil or any excess makeup from the eye area. Then, apply a small dab of cream concealer to hold things in place. 97. “A good perfume should consist of balanced blend of notes arranged in a way that creates harmonious accord.”— Alexis Bergman, P&G’s Global Flavor and Fragrance Trends 96. To prevent hair color from fading in the summer months, use a conditioning treatment weekly or bi-monthly. 95. Breakout before a big event? “Take oral cortisone a few days before the event to clear your skin.”— Ava Shamban, dermatologist and author of Heal Your Skin. 94. “In order to keep eyeliner from running and smearing, opt for liner formulas that offer stayproof wearability.”— Robin Schoen, Urban Decay Makeup Artist 93. Always allow about two fingers from your nose to where blush starts. 92. “Make sure you hydrate the skin and put on a primer.”— Jessie Powers, makeup artist and national educator for Make Up For Ever 91. “Balance out your shimmer. If you’re doing a shimmery eye, opt for a matte lipstick.”— Raychel Wade, founder of Cheek to Chic and La Prairie’s colour ambassador 90. Brush out your curls with your fingers to give your hair a more tousled look. 89. To make your manicure last, apply a thin layer of clear every two days. Pay particular attention to the free edge at the top of your nails, where chips usually happen, and apply extra clear polish there. 88. Wear white eyeliner in your water line to make eyes appear less red. 87. “Take a shimmery gloss to the center of your lips, top and bottom—this will attract light to your lips, making them look pouty.”— Katrina Barrion, makeup artist for Giella Custom Blend Cosmetics 86. For slicked back hair, use a hair serum. 85. For the perfect cat-eye, “select a thin liner brush that is tapered to the point” and use a gel eyeliner for extra saying power. — Pamela Taylor, makeup artist. Credit: Instagram | @tarenguy 84. To make your cheek bones appear higher, use bronzer under the cheekbone and highlighter on the actual cheekbone, and remember to blend. Contouring at its finest! 83. Before you blow dry, start with a volumizing spray or light gel to give the roots some lift. Pull the brush up towards the ceiling to really boost volume. 82. For fuller lips, extend the lip line using a flesh tone lip liner. Be careful not to go overboard. 81. The #1 reason for flaky mascara is that the formula is too dry or old. Make sure to close mascara after use to help keep its moisture. To extend the life a bit, add 2-3 drops of saline solution into the tube and swirl the brush around. 80. To fake clear skin when you notice a pimple, “Apply tea tree oil as soon as you spot it”— Stephanie Flor, makeup artist. 79. “It’s easy to forget that feet can get sunburned. Be sure to apply sunscreen with a minimum SPF of 50 when barefoot.”— Dr. Leslie Campbell, DPM. 78. For acne-free skin, look for a cleanser with salycilic acid or benzoyl peroxide. 77. When choosing a red lipstick, you just want to remember to get one that looks good with your undertone. If you have a warm undertone, then go for warmer reds, and if you have a cool undertone, then go cooler. 76. Sunscreens that claim to provide “all-day protection” and “water resistance” are not reliable; don’t be fooled by these claims and reapply all sunscreens at least every 2-3 hours. 75. When self-tanning, use a tanner with a guide color. “It will give you instant color before the effect and it will show you exactly where you put the color and where you may have missed.”— Sinead Norenius, founder of Beautisol.

Another way to make it less intense? Apply with your fingertip instead of straight from the tube. Credit: Instagram | @farahdhukai 73. For the summer months, you don’t want to be caked down in foundation, so try a tinted moisturizer or BB cream instead. 72. Use blotting papers to manage oil and shine in your T-Zone, “which are also great for cleaning up around the eyes”— Rebecca Restrepo, makeup artist. 71. The antihistamines in allergy medicine dry out the skin, so skip heavy foundation during allergy season. Instead, use a tinted moisturizer. 70. To make curls last, make sure hair is completely dry before you begin with the curling iron. Also, use a heat protectant spray with hold on damp hair to keep hair protected. 69. To make a zit go away faster, don’t pick at it. The bacteria on your fingers will create more redness, and any attempt at popping will make things worse. 68. Use an exfoliator to get rid of dead skin, but limit yourself to 2-3 times a week so you don’t dry out your skin. Use a gentler scrub on your face and a coarser scrub on the rest of your body. 67. Always wash your makeup off before bed. “That morning-after look has never been a good one, for anyone.”— Rachel Adler, beauty director 66. “Too much bronzer is a nightmare for pale skin”— Jason Ascher, resident beauty expert for Barneys New York 65. Pick a sulfate-free shampoo, as sulfates can be harsh and drying on the hair cuticle. 64. If you have greasy hair, avoid directly conditioning roots and condition from your ear down to ends. 63.”When you wear a red lip it’s important that it stays exactly where you put it. Using a long wearing lip pencil to create the perfect shape and a lip color are key to having a perfect red lip.”— Kristofer Buckle, celebrity makeup artist 62. To make volume last all day, avoid running your fingers through hair. “Oil from your hands can weigh down your roots leaving your hair flat at the end of the day”— Tatum Neill, Arrojo Studio 61. Try to avoid washing your hair everyday. Constant shampooing leaves hair dry and your scalp will create more oils to compensate for the loss of moisture. Instead, use a dry shampoo and style your hair into a braid or ponytail when it’s a bit more oily. 60. Always use a moisturizer with SPF in the morning. Even in the winter! Credit: Instagram | @organicbunny 59.”Go for a trim every 6-8 weeks to ensure you have no damaged ends making your hair look unhealthy”— Nick Arrojo, Arrojo Studio (and the man who worked for seven years changing lives on What Not To Wear) 58. Remember, clean your makeup brushes to fight against potential bacteria and breakouts. At least once a week, swirl brushes around in a mixture of warm water and mild soap, then lay flat to dry. 57. Clean out your makeup bag at least once a year to get rid of old products that may be expired or you no longer use. 56. Winter can be especially harsh on your hair leaving it extra dry. Eugene Davis, celebrity hair stylist suggests using an Avocado Oil Hair Mask. 55. If you don’t have nail polish remover, apply clear nail polish over your nail, and then wipe off. It will remove old polish. MORE: The 25 Prettiest, Most-Inspiring 2017 Cannes Beauty Looks 54. During the summer, wear lip balm or gloss with SPF. 53. To add volume to clean or unwashed hair, use a dry shampoo spray. 52.Change your beauty routine for spring and summer months. Your skin needs less coverage during the spring so you can swap the heavy, winter products for lighter ones. 51.”I always think that less is more. There’s a point where you look in the mirror and say ‘Is this too much?’ and if you even have that inclination then it usually is.”— Kim Catrall, “Sex and the City” 50. When applying bronzer, “first start by applying it around the perimeter of your face and follow with a light dusting on your forehead, nose and chin.”— Mally Roncal, Mally Beauty. 49. To get curls when you have straight hair, use, “a volumizer or volume thickening agent, a curl enhancing product, light holding finishing spray.”— Vicktor Stevenson, Hair Stylist. 48.”Foundation should never be heavy.”— Aura Schwartz, makeup artist. Apply liquid foundation with a damp makeup sponge for best results. 47.”The right red [lipstick] will light up your hair, eyes and skin immediately, the wrong one will not.”— Poppy King, Lipstick Queen 46. To clean up the flick of a cat eye, use a dampened, pointed Q-tip. 45.To revive curls mid-day, “Take a very small amount of pomade and put it in the palms of your hands. Rub them together. Next gently smooth the pomade over your curls and scrunch just a little bit.”— Eugene Davis, celebrity hair stylist 44.”You should always go to a hair-removal specialist, where waxing, laser etc. is their main business – don’t go to a nail salon for a wax”— Cindy Barshop, Completely Bare and Bravo’s “RHONYC” 43.”A little silvery-blue eyeliner on the lower lid is very flirty.”— Dimitri James, makeup artist, author and creator of Skinn Cosmetics 42.”Use your concealer as a base on your eyelids.”— Melissa Silver, Maybelline makeup artist. Concealer will help to absorb oil and your eyeshadow will stick to the product instead of your lids, making it stay longer. 41. If you’re not a fan of liquid liner, get the look of liquid eye liner by using a gel instead. 40. Exfoliate before applying self tanner to get rid of dead skin. Tanning products tend to cling to drier areas and rougher areas, like your knees and elbows, so make sure they’re moisturized first. 39. If you straighten your hair with a flat-iron, cause less heat damage by letting hair air dry. The less heat, the better! 38. To minimize pores, use a pore-minimizing facial wash followed by a toner. Make sure the toner is alchohol-free so it won’t dry out your skin. 37. The healthier you are, the healthier your hair! Take a daily multi-vitamin with Biotin to help hair grow faster. Credit: Instagram | @courtney_shields 36.To mask split ends, use an iron to straighten ends and then apply a hair repair cream. 35.There are always cheap, natural and effective homemade beauty recipes. 34.To fix brassy hair color, use a color-depositing shampoo with purple tones. For unwanted redness, use a color-depositer with a green tone. 33. To cover up roots in a hurry, use a dry shampoo spray for your hair color. If you don’t keep this product around, use eyeshadow (in a shade closest to your hair color) for a quick fix. 32. Get a “dewy glow” using a highlighter or illuminator above your cheekbones and on the brow bone, just underneath your eyebrows. 31. To contour cheeks, use a matte powder (a few shades darker than your skin tone) with an angled brush. Blend on temples and under cheek bone. 30.When using a cream product (blush or eyeshadow), lock it in by using a translucent powder over it. 29. Get quick volume by using a root lifter, then use hairspray to set hair. This will prevent it from falling flat during the day. 28. For makeup that lasts all day and night, use a makeup-sealing product like a setting spray. 27. To help you find the right shade of foundation, choose the product you think is closest to your color and try it on your jaw line in natural light. You will be able to easily compare it to your neck’s color to see if you need to go for a different undertone, lighter or darker. 26. Try out the funky hair color trends without dyeing your hair. Instead, dust bright blush in your ponytail for the same effect. (Refinery29) 25. “Foot perspiration is typical in the summer and can lead to fungal infection and unwanted odor. Wash feet daily, and let them dry thoroughly before putting shoes on.”— Dr. Leslie Campbell, DPM. 24. Splurge on items that are important to you.”If mascara is really your thing and you fall in love with a mascara that’s $40, buy the mascara.”— Raychel Wade, founder of Cheek to Chic and La Prairie’s colour ambassador 23.”Don’t be too serious: It’s only Makeup! “— Francois NARS insists you play around with new colors. 22. To reduce unwanted shine, use a moisturizer that mattifies your skin. That way you get the moisture your skin needs without looking greasy. 21. To create a lived-in look for your hair, use thickening or sea-salt mist before you blow-dry. Follow by running a volumizing or texture cream through hair. 20. When using an eyeshadow primer, only place the primer where you’ll be adding color. 19.”Cream rouge [blush] should be the first thing that touches your cheeks when you want to project an image of healthy and pinched cheeks.”— Pablo Manzoni, former creative director for Elizabeth Arden 18. If you choose to use false eyelashes, remember to use the dark glue as it will blend in with the lashes. Credit: Instagram | @chrisspy 17. When buying “organic” beauty products, make sure to check if they are FDA certified organic. This will prevent you from getting scammed. 16. Use a facial exfoliater bi-weekly to get dead skin of dead skin. Makeup will look better on a clean, smooth canvas. 15. After using a hair conditioning mask, follow with “a cold water rinse to close the hair cuticles.”— Ursala Stephensen, celebrity stylist. 14. To get your braid to last all day, try styling hair that’s dirty with product. This will make the style stick longer. 13. Use a clarifying shampoo once a week to get rid of any product build-up that may have occurred during the week. 12. If you have chipped nail polish, add glitter on top to disguise the look of chipping. 11. Use a pumice stone on your feet after the shower to get rid of calluses. 10. Hydrate your under-eye area with an eye cream to prevent puffiness and bags. 9. If you have light hair,”put a lotion over the eyebrows and hair-line” when self-tanning the face. Also remember to “apply it in circular motions and blend down to the neck.”— Sinead Norenius, founder of Beautisol 8. If you often find yourself being too tired to wash your face at night, keep makeup removing wipes in your night stand to prevent a runny mess or morning break out. 7. Pop 1-2 Advil before going waxing to prevent pain. 6. The best way to get rid of ingrown hairs is to exfoliate,”which rids the skin of dead cells and allows the hair to break through the surface.”— Marlena Ramoy, Bliss Spa esthetician. 5. Carrots are good for the hair. A healthy diet leads to a beautiful you. 4.”The best time to apply creams is after the shower, as the skin has been de-oiled.”— Dr. Stephen P. Bracci 3. Replace mascara and liquid eyeliner after 3-4 months. 2. To keep hair color vibrant longer, use shampoos and conditioners formulated for colored hair. 1. Use a cream or milk cleanser to wash your face. Creams are less drying than gels. Originally published August 2014. Updated May 2017.   0 GOT THOUGHTS?

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: How Kimberly Clark Corp Makes Most of Its Money How just a few brands -- and one key market -- account for the majority of this consumer goods giant's profits each year. Demitrios Kalogeropoulos (TMFSigma) May 23, 2017 at 9:03AM In its last fiscal year, global consumer products giant Kimberly-Clark (NYSE:KMB) generated just over $2 billion of net income from its revenue base of $18.2 billion. Most those earnings came from just a few of its most popular brands, Huggies, Kotex, and Kleenex and were produced in one critical market: the United States. Huggies and Depends Kimberly-Clark's personal care division was responsible for half of its sales last year -- up from 39% in 2003 to mark a 6% compound annual growth rate over the last 13 years. That segment is home to the company's single biggest franchise: Huggies, and generated $1.86 billion, or 56% of total operating profit in 2016. Image source: Getty Images. The Huggies brand trails Procter & Gamble's (NYSE:PG) Pampers, which by itself delivers $9 billion in annual sales for the consumer goods titan. Yet Kimberly-Clark still gets plenty of value from its prime positioning in the diaper and baby care markets. The personal care segment posted 4% higher volume in 2016 and only a slight decrease in average prices. Operating margin for the division is 20.5% -- higher than the company's overall average margin of 18.4%. Kimberly-Clark is the market leader in the adult diaper segment behind the Poise and Depend brands, too. Its long-term plan aims to advance market share in that and the baby care segment primarily through frequent innovation like the recent Huggies premium upgrades and new pull-up pants styles. Behind personal care sits Kimberly-Clark's tissue segment that's anchored by its blockbuster Kleenex tissue brand. With volume running flat last year, management sees less room for organic growth in this division, but instead aims to boost operating margin through cost cuts. In 2016, the company succeeded in raising tissue segment profitability by more than a percentage point to 18.7% of sales.  The U.S. market Kimberly-Clark is heavily reliant on the U.S. market, which last year accounted for 52% of sales and a whopping 70% of profits. That's a far higher proportion of revenue than rival P&G, which counts 44% of its business from its U.S. segment. The extra dependence on the rich, but mature, U.S. economy means Kimberly-Clark enjoys relatively high profit margins but lower organic growth. Its 18% operating margin trounces global rival Unilever. On the other hand, Unilever is expecting to grow organic sales by between 3% and 5% this year, while Kimberly-Clark is projecting its second straight year of 2% gains. Sluggish growth in the U.S. played a key role in Kimberly-Clark's underperformance last year when, rather than expanding at a 5% rate, as management originally projected, organic growth ended up at 2%. The segment has been an even bigger drag on results so far in 2017. Organic growth declined 3% in the U.S. in the fiscal first quarter as the industry slowed and competition heated up. Management believes sales trends will start improving in the second half of 2017 with help from innovative new product launches in the Kotex, Huggies, and Kleenex brands. However, generally weak industry conditions mean most of its profit growth in the coming year will likely come from cost cuts that ideally will continue pushing profitability toward 20% of sales. Foreign currency swings will be much less of a drag on results in 2017, but that benefit should be offset by rising commodity prices. That's why executives still see earnings improving by between 3% and 5% this year even as sales growth, targeted at 1.5%, comes in well below their long-term target of between 3% and 5%.

At the Retail and Consumer Goods Analytics Summit (RCAS) 2017, held in Chicago April 26-28, headline speakers from Kimberly-Clark, Walmart and NBCUniversal drilled this business reality home with real-world examples from the field and advice for those far along the analytics maturity ladder as well as those just starting out. In its fourth year RCAS really hit its stride. We had our most impressive speaker lineup to date and a packed meeting room filled with the who’s who in analytics in both retail and consumer goods. The event kicked off with a masterful keynote presentation by Suja Chandrasekaran, CIO, Kimberly-Clark Corporation. The former SVP and global chief technology officer & chief data officer at Walmart gave a tour-de-force recap of the current state of analytics across both retail and consumer goods. “As an industry we are behind in analytics,” she said. “And we can’t be behind. It is not rocket science we can master it.” The key to the mastery of next-gen analytics according to Chandrasekaran is artificial intelligence and machine learning that can provide true predictive insight into shopper behavior and demand. “Traditional analytics lose value over time,” she said. “While AI based systems gain value.” Following Chandrasekaran’s opening keynote, David Ahuja, senior director, Walmart Technology took to the stage and followed the theme of taking analytics capabilities to the next level. He spoke of the evolution of analytics from a misunderstood discipline to the backbone of every major organization today. Analytics started with the buzz of big data and IT execs spent a lot of time explaining its use to business leaders. Analytics 2.0 ushered in the age of the data scientist.  “We all hired a bunch of people with the title of data scientist and told them to go do data science,” he said. “They were all over the company doing great work but it was not very organized.” As we enter what he dubs Analytics 3.0 the digital enterprise is not about technology but providing value for the customer and retailers need to adjust their strategy and processes to meet this new reality. “Our biggest problem is data,” he said. “Not creating data but working with it. If you are not paying attention to governance, on how you make decision models, you will need to do it. If you do not get the data right you cannot do the analytics effectively.” The effective use of analytic tools was the cornerstone of David Dittmann’s, director, business intelligence & analytics services, Procter & Gamble, presentation on predictive and prescriptive analytics. He discussed P&G’s long history with analytics, from its humble beginnings in 1963 to its market-leading position today. He discussed the importance of getting business leaders’ buy-in to build truly dynamic analytic capabilities. “Leadership doesn’t view models as sexy,” he said. “You need to come up with a way to engage business in the models. There must be a place for senior leadership to come in and engage.” The key to enterprise level success Dittmann believes is the analysts’ ability to be highly fluent in the business. They cannot be a separate entity, but valuable members of the decision-making process. To earn this seat at the table, however, data scientists must be able or create unexpected insights that can be leveraged to make critical business decisions. The innovative use of analytics firepower was a key theme of Cameron Davies’, senior vice president, analytics, NBCUniversal, presentation. He discussed Everett Rogers five traits of successful innovations and provided an analytics spin to the author’s seminal work, and provided real-world examples from NBCUniversal. The five traits are create a relative advantage; compatibility; simple and easy to use; easy to trial; and observable result. Create a relative advantage. There are four types of superiority: create an economic benefit, social prestige, pain relief (Uber), and immediate reward (tinder) he said. “We created an analytics dashboard so people can get what they need and the team doesn’t have to spend 70% of their time sending out reports. Build from the business problem down, not the tech up.” Compatibility. The degree to which an idea aligns with the targeted users’ current worldviews, habits, and activities. Simple and easy to use. How well users can easily learn and adapt a concept’s key functions. Easy to trial. How well an innovation can be sampled, tested, or trialed at low risk. “You need to have centralized teams that can help people get started,” he said. “You need to be able to spin up a low cost proof of concept. Fail fast and cheap, adjust, then try again.” Observable results. How the benefits of the concept can be easily measure or observed. “Success breeds success and failure breeds contempt,” he said. “Profitable projects rarely have trouble finding funding.” This is just a small taste of the magic that was up on the stage at RCAS this year. If you are involved in the field of analytics or simply need a better understanding of the discipline to better perform your job, attendance at RCAS is a must.

Submit news Top African execs choose an MBA 23 May 2017 | Save | Email | Print |  PDF     Top executives in South Africa and the rest of the world may no longer consider an MBA the postgraduate qualification of choice but research into the leadership landscape in key economic hubs in Africa shows that top African execs throughout the continent still choose to pursue an MBA. © Denis Ismagilov – 123RF.comResearch into the leadership landscape in key economic hubs in Africa, conducted by Jack Hammer’s Africa Desk for its latest Executive Report (Volume IV - The Africa Report: Leadership Strategies for Sustainable Growth), researched the makeup of the 259 leaders from the executive teams of 36 multinational companies which successfully navigated expansion and growth in Africa. Companies researched included General Electric, Siemens, Unilever, Microsoft, Coca Cola and Procter & Gamble. Findings into the leadership teams’ qualifications showed that top African execs throughout the continent were exponentially more likely to hold an MBA compared to their expat peers. Of all the leaders surveyed, only 26% held MBAs. Yet local nationals held 81% of these MBAs, compared to only 19% of expats. Explaining this stark difference between the number of expats and local nationals holding an MBA, Debbie Goodman-Bhyat, CEO of Jack Hammer says that where the qualifications bar for African leaders to be noticed and stand out is high, an MBA continues to be seen as an effective way to differentiate oneself and prove grit, intellectual prowess and business savvy. “Many African leaders who rise to the top have spent some years furthering their education abroad and multinationals will often invest in developing their top talent in this way, by financing and enabling a leader to pursue MBA studies.” MBA applications rise According to the Association of MBAs’ 2015 Application and Enrolment Report, enrolments for global MBA programmes from African students have risen by 4% since 2011. “With companies increasingly appointing local leaders, rather than expats, to key leadership roles and an increase in global business schools presenting MBA programmes in partnership with multinationals, this trend is set to continue for some time.” Meanwhile, a general overview of the qualifications landscape of the sample pool of top leaders in Africa shows that 84% have a strong technical qualification, in either finance (35%), engineering (13%) or science (31%). Legal and humanities degrees make up the difference. Additionally, 52% of executives in this group hold an MBA, Masters or PhD. “This is a statistically significant finding. In a move away from the historical trend, where the pool of local African executives with higher qualifications - particularly higher technical qualifications from respected institutions - was relatively limited and competition for these candidates fierce, our research shows that career-minded leaders have over the past decade invested heavily in their education. “So in addition to now being able to source highly qualified candidates, companies are increasingly investing in their top talent by providing international study and partnership opportunities, which further strengthens top leadership teams not just within companies, but also at individual level. “Strong academic credentials lead to increased executive and leadership opportunities, which ultimately bode well for the development and sustainability of strong leadership on the continent, concludes Goodman-Bhyat. ‹    Like Save Email Print PDF Comment on thisComment Comment guidelines and disclaimer LEGAL DISCLAIMER: This Message Board accepts no liability of legal consequences that arise from the Message Boards (e.g. defamation, slander, or other such crimes).

"As trademark professionals, we too must evolve," he said, urging everyone to move from being a technical trademark practitioner to becoming a steward of the brand. To illustrate this, Ferretti described the history of branding from the 19th century (when the focus of differentiation was functional) through the 20th century, when companies such as Procter & Gamble communicated their brand message to consumers through television content and into in the late 1980s when social issues made brand owners become conscious of their corporate social responsibility. Today, social media has changed branding again. But brand owners and their managers are still learning how to navigate this change and must "actively listen to consumers" and allow them to lead the conversation. He urged brand owners to take bold steps to give consumers control. "Put them in the driver’s seat," Ferretti said, reassuring the audience that many brands have succeeded by taking this approach. Doing so, you will end up having consumers as your brand ambassadors who will help communicate the positive authentic brand message you want to deliver. Ferretti concluded by advising trademark practitioners to understand the DNA of the brand and make sure promises made to consumers are delivered. Do so and you can navigate your brands to a successful future. Earlier at the ceremony INTA Chief Executive Etienne Sanz de Acedo said there are 10,600 attendees this year, with 2,400 newcomers and more than 8,000 repeat attendees. Spain’s education and culture minister Íñigo Méndez de Vigo gave the keynote speech. Comments   0 Print Close Display this name Please enter your name... Please enter your name...

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 24 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Pregnancy Detection Kits Market – An insight on the important factors and trends influencing the market Pregnancy test kits are devices used to detect possible pregnancy in females. Pregnancy tests are generally done after the first day of missed period. Fewer pregnancy test kits in which detection is possible through urine sample are user friendly and can be demonstrated at home by understanding the manual. These pregnancy test kits give an early indication of pregnancy. Generally, home pregnancy test kits provide 99% accurate results and can be further confirmed by undergoing a lab pregnancy test. These kits are designed to detect human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) hormone, a pregnancy hormone, in the urine sample or blood sample. hCG increases in the early days of pregnancy and presence of this hormone above particular range confirms pregnancy. The global pregnancy detection kits market is driven growing awareness about early and self-detection of pregnancy, increasing demand for self-detection of pregnancy boosted by rising adolescent pregnancy rate, technological advancements in pregnancy tests making it more accurate, promotional strategies employed by manufacturers with celebrity endorsement which influences the rural population to undertake self-pregnancy test through kits, and expansion of logistics network by distributors and manufacturers to increase accessibility of the kits. However, high cost is a major restraint of the global pregnancy detection kits market which is a concern in the undeveloped and developed countries. The risk factor associated with the inaccuracy of the test results is also hampering the growth of the global pregnancy detection kits market. Obtain Report Details: www.transparencymarketresearch.com/pregnancy-detection-ki… The global pregnancy detection kits market can be segmented based on product type, type of test, end-user, and region. In terms of product type, the global pregnancy detection kits market is divided into digital devices and line indicators such as strip/dip, cassettes, and mid-stream devices. Based on test type, the market can be segmented into LH urine test, hCG urine test, FSH urine test, and hCG blood test. In terms of end-user, the market can be segmented into hospitals, diagnostic labs, and home care. The home care segment includes distribution channels such as hospital pharmacies, retail pharmacies, and online pharmacies. In terms of region, the global pregnancy detection kits market can be segmented into North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America, and Middle East & Africa. North America dominates the global pregnancy detection kits market due to increased health care spending by the government. Europe is the next major market in terms of revenue and is driven by high usage of digital pregnancy test kits due to increased disposable income and growing awareness regarding the test. Asia Pacific is expected to grow exponentially during the forecast period led by growing awareness about early detection of pregnancy and its benefits, rising population, increasing disposable income, and better access to pregnancy tests in the rural sector. Latin America is an emerging market for pregnancy detection kits due to growing awareness and availability of pregnancy test kits at affordable prices. The market in Middle East & Africa is expected to witness sluggish growth due to less awareness regarding the usage of pregnancy kit and its associated benefits.

News sign-up BBDO agencies dominate WARC 100 category rankings News, 24 May 2017 Topics Findings from effectiveness awards GLOBAL: BBDO Worldwide was the top agency network in the 2017 WARC 100 and its subsidiary creative agencies led the way in particular categories, according to a new sectoral analysis of the rankings. The WARC 100 tracks results from over 80 effectiveness and strategy competitions from around the world and ranks the 100 best marketing campaigns, agencies and brands. In a new series of reports, WARC examines six categories – food, drinks, FMCG, automotive, retail and financial services – and highlights those brands and agencies that performed best in each during 2015-16. BBDO Hong Kong was awarded the most points for food campaigns in the WARC 100 (including two highly effective campaigns for chocolate bar Snickers: 'Hungry Slip Ups' and 'You're Not You When You're Hungry'), with AMV BBDO in second and Energy BBDO in fourth place. Colenso BBDO garnered the most points for drinks campaigns, including the top two ('Brewtroleum' for DB Export Beer and 'Must Be Milk' for Anchor's soft drink), with AMV BBDO again in second and Impact BBDO Cairo in fourth place. In FMCG, meanwhile, the runaway success of the award-winning 'Share the Load' campaign in India for Procter & Gamble's Ariel detergent, ensured that its originator BBDO Mumbai was far ahead of the pack. Grey London was awarded the most points in the automotive category for its 'Lifepaint' campaign for Volvo. This was recently put under the spotlight by the Advertising Standards Authority in the UK, which found a YouTube version of the ad to be misleading because of the implication that the paint would work equally well on both textiles and metal bicycle frames. adam&eveDDB was awarded the most points for retail campaigns, with the majority coming from its Christmas advertising work for John Lewis – the second placed campaign in the WARC 100. And McCann XBC topped the financial services category, with its #OneMoreDay campaign for MasterCard.

It’s a big deal for Target because of its potential to raise prices for American families—something we can’t get behind. Over the past several months, senior leaders have been meeting with Members of Congress and the Administration to express concerns about the BAT—and what it would mean for our guests, team and business. Read on for some important things to know. It would take a toll on American families Our main concern with the proposed BAT? It’d have a major impact on our guests, the 30 million Americans who shop Target each week. That’s because, if enacted, it would raise prices on everyday essentials by up to 20 percent. We’re not talking about luxury goods, but things like school clothes, shoes, groceries, medicine, electronics and bed sheets. That would add up fast for, say, a new mom or dad stocking up on baby supplies, or someone moving into their first apartment. Many of our guests are middle-class working families on tight budgets, and some simply can’t afford to pay more for these important items. It’s not realistic for our supply chain Our broad assortment of merchandise spans many categories, and depends on complex supply chains that were built over decades. The reality is, certain product categories just aren’t available to buy from U.S. sources. Some examples? Apparel: About 97 percent of all apparel sold in the U.S. is manufactured overseas. Electronics: Nearly all of our phones and tablets are made in places like Japan, Korea and China. And food: We’re never going to grow bananas in Michigan or coffee beans in Ohio. U.S. vendors are already among Target’s top suppliers While we depend on global supply chains to provide goods we can’t buy in the U.S., Target’s still a major purchaser of domestic goods. In fact, eight of our 10 largest strategic vendors are located right here in the states, including companies like Proctor & Gamble, Pepsi, Kimberly-Clark and Johnson & Johnson. There’s a broad coalition of businesses that oppose the BAT We’re a founding member of Americans for Affordable Products—a coalition of more than 500 businesses and trade associations opposed to the BAT proposal. It’s not just retailers … there are also main street coffee shops, car dealers, grocery stores, gas stations and restaurants. Because the BAT would be bad for both large companies like us and lots of small businesses too. And it’s not a partisan thing—opposition to the BAT crosses party lines, with members of Congress from both sides of the aisle expressing concern with the consequences for American families. Target wants tax reform, just not the BAT While Target opposes the BAT, we strongly support tax reform. We already pay a high effective tax rate—an average of 35 percent over the last decade. So we’re as motivated as anyone to bring that rate down and grow the economy so we can invest and create more jobs. The House leadership’s blueprint proposes setting the rate at 20 percent and we would gladly support that change. In fact, we’ve said we would put all the current preferences we have on the table in order to achieve meaningful reform.

RedZone has begun integrating the technology into the app Helios and Matheson Analytics Inc (NASDAQ: HMNY) was top riser on Nasdaq as it acquired the license to facial recognition technology from Israeli biometrics technology company IsItYou. The technology will be integrated with the group's RedZone Map app - the artificial intelligence technology and real-time crime database. It will enable RedZone Map users to identify people from an image on a  smartphone camera or video. In future, and for any James Bond fans out there, RedZone plans to be able to deliver real-time notifications of criminally active individuals in a user’s area. This may be a large event or public space, by seeking permitted access to public surveillance cameras operated by private enterprises or government entities. “Through artificial intelligence and facial recognition technology, we will seek to develop the capability to identify dangerous people entering an area and notify our users in real time,” said Ted Farnsworth, founder of RedZone. “Sending notifications to our users of when their safety is more likely at risk, whether at a concert, in a shopping mall, or simply walking down the street, would greatly increase the utility of RedZone Map to our users. This is a key goal in our continuing development of RedZone Map.” RedZone has begun integrating and plans to continue integrating the facial recognition technology into the app over coming months. Helios shares added over 65% to $4.05 each.

Read this before heading to the beach. One of the crucial mistakes people make when choosing sunscreens is thinking that protecting against sunburn alone will also block all UV rays. [Photo: Jason Todd/Getty Images] By Eillie Anzilotti4 minute Read As someone whose skin is so pale it veers into blue, I funnel an absurd amount of money into the sunscreen industry each year, starting right around now. It’s an expense, so I tend to grab whatever’s cheapest; if I’m lucky, there’s a buy one, get one 50% off deal at the drugstore. advertisement But my thrifty approach may, according to the 2017 Guide to Sunscreens just released by the Environmental Working Group (EWG), be setting me up for a host of unpleasant and costly health problems down the line. Around three-quarters of products on the market fail to actually protect skin from the sun; some actually exacerbate the skin’s sensitivity to damaging rays. Many others contain ingredients that you don’t want to be rubbing on your skin. This is the 11th year of the EWG’s sunscreen guide, and since its inception, the industry has been slow to change. When we wrote about the 2010 guide, just 8% of the 500 products the EWG tested passed muster in terms of sunburn and UV protection. Now, they’ve tested over 1,500, and found that just 215 beach and sport sunscreens–around 14%–will satisfactorily shield your skin. “You look at an SPF 100 product and that implies a certain level of protection, but it actually sends a very misleading message.” [Photo: weerapatkiatdumrong/iStock]The problem is lack of regulation. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), says Sonya Lunder, EWG senior analyst and lead scientist on the 2017 Guide to Sunscreens, “has indicated that they have concerns about the efficacy of the products on the market,” and while the agency passed some industry regulations in 2011–the term “sunblock,” for instance, was outlawed–it has yet to pass more stringent guidelines. One of the main fallouts from this lack of oversight is sunscreens labeled with an SPF–sunburn protection factor–of well over 50, sometimes as high as 100. Theoretically, Lunder says, an SPF of 100 means that you could stay out in the sun 100 times longer than you would under unmodified circumstances. “But this is probably my biggest beef with the sunscreen industry,” Lunder tells Fast Company. “You look at an SPF 100 product and that implies a certain level of protection, but it actually sends a very misleading message.” SPF values are determined by applying a thick layer of sunscreen to the skin, and assessing the severity of the burn that develops after masochistic volunteers are exposed to lights of varying intensity in a lab. Not only do these conditions not mimic real-life scenarios, but they also produce scattershot results: When Proctor & Gamble tested a competitor’s SPF 100 product, they found the protection ranged from SPF 37 and SPF 75. The numbers are more like a strong marketing ploy: People flock to high-SPF products because they think they can apply them once and forget about them, Lunder says. But cheap sunscreens contain ingredients that break down in the sun and wash off in wind and water, and people neglect to reapply or throw on a shirt because they think the SPF 100 has them covered. “So they end up spending more time in the sun and getting more UV exposure,” Lunder says. Among adult Americans, rates of skin cancer have tripled since the 1970s. [Photo: dimid_86/iStock]And even should someone walk away from a day at the beach with no sunburn, having adequately reapplied a high-SPF product, that’s no guarantee that they’re protecting against melanoma, Lunder says. Among adult Americans, rates of skin cancer have tripled since the 1970s, from 7.9 per 100,000 people in 1975 to 25.2 per 100,000 in 2014. Severe sunburns and exposure to UV radiation are two of the key risk factors of melanoma, and Lunder says one of the crucial mistakes people make when choosing sunscreens is thinking that protecting against sunburn alone–as in, gravitating toward high SPF bottles–will also block all UV rays. While high SPF sunscreens can shield people from UVB rays, which cause sunburn, they do next to nothing to protect against UVA rays, which are used in tanning beds and while they don’t cause burns, can heighten the risk of melanoma later in life. The damage from UVA rays is much more subtle, and often doesn’t immediately show on the skin. However, UVA exposure adds up throughout a person’s life without proper protection, which Lunder says is only offered through mineral-based sunscreens containing either zinc oxide or avobenzone, neither of which break down in the sun. advertisement The issue with mineral-based products, Lunder says, is they often, when applied, tint the skin white, and don’t have the cosmetic appeal of breezy sprays (which are largely ineffective because they fail to coat the skin) or SPF-tinged moisturizers. The latter, though, are especially dangerous because they contain additions like oxybenzone and the Vitamin A-based retinyl palmitate, which are included for anti-aging benefits, but heighten the skin’s sensitivity to UV rays and may speed the development of tumors. When sunscreens advertise “broad spectrum” protection, they’re claiming that they protect against both UVA and UVB rays, Lunder says. But UVA and UVB protection do not harmonize, and because the FDA caps the number of active ingredients in a product, high SPF sunscreens–which are geared toward protecting against UVB rays–leave very little room for anti-UVA ingredients like zinc oxide and avobenzone. Regulations in Europe, Lunder says, mandate a more even balance between UVA and UVB protection, so while the SPF numbers may be lower across the pond, the “broad spectrum” claims are more valid. So how might beachgoers, preparing to shake off the drab, rainy cloak of spring, navigate the sunscreen aisle before heading to the shore? The EWG makes it easy, with a list of tips: Steer clear of products labeled with SPFs higher than 50; avoid sprays, which can’t be applied as thickly, avoid oxybenzone and Vitamin A, and check out this handy list of EWG-approved products. And when in doubt, always bring a shirt and hat.

What better time to focus on peace and listen to the voices of the peace-makers? Scilla Ellworthy challenges our assumptions about wars and presents a powerful strategy for building peace. If you want peace, you don't talk to your friends. You talk to your enemies. Until now it has been normal to consider military might as the determinant of an international pecking order. Possession of the weapons and the forces to deter or frighten other nations has even determined the structure of the United Nations, giving the power of veto to the five permanent members of the Security Council, who also happen to be among the world’s biggest arms sellers as well as the first possessors of nuclear weapons. War makes a relatively few people extremely rich. Global military expenditure in 2015 was an estimated US$1.67 trillion, equal to US$217 for each person in the world. The total value of the global arms trade in 2014 was at least US$94.5 billion. By contrast, US$24 billion per year would ensure clean water and safe sanitation for everyone on the planet. Those who thrive in war are also people traffickers, arms smugglers, money launderers, drug dealers and others who require a lawless environment to make a fortune. Stopping war, because it is such an unfamiliar concept to us, requires a substantial shift in assumptions. Traditionally it has been assumed that weaponry and “defence” will bring security, and therefore that more weaponry will bring more security. How peace can be built Humanity has now entered a new era where these assumptions require an overhaul. The major threats to our security now emanate from issues that cannot be dealt with by weaponry, namely global warming, migration, cyber attack and the rich–poor gap. Our security now depends on our ability to cooperate with nations who might previously have been our enemies. We now know enough about preventing armed violence to avoid the catastrophic consequences of recent wars. The overall strategy in my latest book,  The Business Plan for Peace: Making a World Without War Possible, is to develop a whole-systems approach to building peace worldwide, from the local level to national, regional and global levels. The three basic principles include dialogue, prevention, and valuing women. Dialogue Attempts to stop war from the top down often fail because of the mindsets – fear, aggression, competition, greed – shared by most of those leaders filtered to the top by our current systems. One of the best ways to overcome the force of these attitudes and emotions is by systematically building trust through dialogue. The Oxford Process is a tried and tested programme developed by Oxford Research Group over three decades, facilitating high-level dialogue between those involved in some of the world’s most intractable conflicts. It uses the tools of analysis, cultural savvy and human psychology to understand and manage both the tensions and the human relationships that underpin conflict. These same tools can be learned and applied by any of us to transform conflicts in the family, in the community, or further afield. Prevention The keys to successful prevention of war are respect, speed of reaction, and developing an understanding of how power works. All the research I have seen over 35 years shows that the main cause of fighting is humiliation: interviews with death row inmates revealed that this was the most common motivation for homicide. The best antidote to humiliation is respect. It’s hard to find something to respect in those you may hate or despise, but they too are human and have qualities you can unearth and salute. It works: it produces the possibility of dialogue. Your speed of reaction requires practice. This can be acquired through meditation, martial arts, and all practices that train you in self-awareness. The more self-knowledge you have, the more effective you will be in preventing violence – whether verbal or physical. Locally led peace-building initiatives excel in the skills of prevention. The organisation Peace Direct was set up to support grass-roots peace builders, because local people tend to know best how to resolve local conflicts. Peace Direct’s research in turn resulted in Insight on Conflict, an online initiative that currently reports on over 1,400 peace-building organisations across 44 different conflict-affected regions. Breaking the cycle of violence The cycle of violence starts with an atrocity, causing terror and trauma, followed by grief and then anger, which leads to the drive for retaliation and revenge, causing an escalation of atrocities. Thus the cycle of violence can continue over generations and even centuries. The cycle can be broken by tried and tested methods of conflict transformation, including consultation with religious leaders, bridge building, setting up truth and reconciliation commissions, training mediators, freeing child soldiers, trauma counselling and strengthening the rule of law. At national level, governments can establish an infrastructure for peace, a process pioneered in South Africa by Nelson Mandela, developing peace councils at national, regional, city, town and even village levels through which respected community leaders can be trained in violence-prevention methods and developing a peace plan for their area should violence break out. This has already been copied in Ghana and Kenya. Enable women to help make peace Women are shown to be the most effective and tenacious peace builders. However, more than 90% of negotiators and those in policymaking positions on peace and conflict are male, meaning that the suffering and trauma of women and children in war are not taken into account at the peace table. Swanee Hunt, a former US ambassador to Austria, and the Women Waging Peace Policy Commission have conducted 15 field-based case studies to document women’s contributions to conflict prevention, peace negotiations and post-war reconstruction. This has now yielded a network of over 1,000 trained women leaders from more than 30 conflicts, and strategies to ensure their acceptance in policymaking positions and peace negotiations. What it will cost To my knowledge no one has so far attempted to cost the strategies necessary to build a world without war. So in my book I have laid out a first blueprint for a business plan for peace – based on 20 years developing dialogue between nuclear weapons decision-makers and their informed critics, as well as 15 years supporting locally led peace-building initiatives. This plan describes and costs the following: Four systems for preventing conflict and building peace at local level, at a total cost of US$159 million; Nine systems for preventing conflict and building peace at national/regional level, at a total cost of US$664 million; and Twelve systems for preventing conflict and building peace at international level, at a total cost of US$1,178 million. The total cost of local, national and international systems for preventing conflict over a 10-year period comes to just over US$2 billion. By comparison, in a year we spend US$59 billion on ice cream, Procter & Gamble spent US$9.3 billion on advertising in 2012, and the decommissioning costs of the Fukushima reactors will top US$105 billion. Who can do it? The key strategy is to do the personal work – the inner development – that is essential if people are to be effective in their efforts to make the world a safer place. This is for a specific reason: when we have strong emotions like fear or anger, if we’re not awake to what’s going on inside us we tend to project those emotions onto others. This projection, on a larger scale, is what causes wars. Leaders become excessively incensed with the aggressivity of the other side when they have not examined and dealt with their own internal anger. This demonisation of the other permits all kinds of horror. If we are to work effectively in conflict, whether in government or at the grass roots, we need to understand this kind of projection on a personal level. To do this can be uncomfortable and can require real courage, because we are confronting our own deeply embedded convictions and emotions. But when we really get it – that is, really get what a hugely powerful force it can be – we become ten times more effective. What becomes evident in this work is that we are living through an age of profound transformation in the human condition. The human-made issues we face in this turbulent age are challenging our human capacity to evolve. We have the opportunity now, as never before, to develop our consciousness – and therefore our way of treating one another – to a new level. This article was first published in Resurgence & Ecologist magazine, May/June 2017. Scilla Elworthy founded the Oxford Research Group in 1982 to develop dialogue between nuclear weapons policymakers and their critics. She has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize three times. She founded Peace Direct in 2003 and was awarded the Niwano Peace Prize in the same year. In 2013 she co-founded Rising Women Rising World.     Previous Articles... | Permalink | Trackbacks (0) | Email a Friend | Print this ECOLOGIST COOKIES Using this website means you agree to us using simple cookies.

"I see Uber as one of the stupidest businesses in history," said Mr Douglass. "The probability of this business not going bankrupt in a decade is like 1 per cent." Pointing to the high-cost owner-driver model of Uber's supply side and the almost "valueless" user base, Mr Douglass described the San Francicso-based business's capital-raising style as a "ponzi scheme".

They tried to steal it from Google, they've ended up in court. That whole side of the business is falling apart. It's constantly losing money and it's capital-raising strategy is a ponzi scheme. "All they do is keep increasing their private market valuation and someone always says, I'll put some money up, because next time they raise, it'll be at a higher price."

The case is currently being heard in San Francisco. "Some of the smartest investors in the world like to show off how they got access to Uber, but I think there's a 99 per cent chance that business will collapse."

Mr Douglass discussed Magellan's heavy exposure to technology businesses, and spent time discussing the onslaught of Amazon on the retail and technology sector. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link After slamming Uber, Douglass praised Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. Photo: Getty Images Mr Douglass heaped praise on Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and his ability to grow Amazon to a $US430 billion business after only raising a total of $US150 million. "He's a hero of mine and I think Warren Buffett is right," said Mr Douglass. "He's the businessman of our generation." The probability of this business not going bankrupt in a decade is like 1 per cent. Hamish Douglass Despite his admiration for Amazon's founder, the asset manager remains wary of just how clear the business's rate of return is. Separating the different arms of Amazon - Prime, its content and expedited delivery subscription service; marketplace; and Amazon Web Services.- have kept the asset manager on the side. "I only buy things when I have a clear view of the rate of return," says Mr Douglass. "I've got teams trying to model exactly what that is for Amazon and we haven't got it yet. It's proven hard to work out a proper valuation." But the reach of Amazon's disruption is certain and Mr Douglass mimicked a scenario where he and his "Internet of things connected house" discussed his weekly groceries. "My house is going to tell me when I've run out of detergent and it's going to offer me the Amazon brand cheap product," he said. "While Proctor & Gamble have thirty feet of their products lining Walmart and a 60 per cent market share, Bezos will assault that model. "We are in a time when it doesn't work for investors to think three-to-six months ahead. The disruption in our markets is seriously deep."

clock menu more-arrow How Anker is beating Apple and Samsung at their own accessory game by Nick Statt@nickstatt May 22, 2017, 10:19am EDT Illustrations by William Joel Photography by James Bareham share tweet Linkedin Steven Yang quit his job at Google in the summer of 2011 to build the products he felt the world needed: a line of reasonably priced accessories that would be better than the ones you could buy from Apple and other big-name brands. These accessories — batteries, cables, chargers — would solve our most persistent gadget problem by letting us stay powered on at all times. There were just a few problems: Yang knew nothing about starting a company, building consumer electronics, or selling products. “I was a software engineer all my life at Google. I didn’t know anyone in the electronics manufacturing world,” Yang tells me over Skype from his office in Shenzhen, China. But he started the company regardless, thanks in no small part to his previous experience with Amazon’s sellers marketplace, a platform for third-party companies and tiny one- or two-person teams interested in selling directly to consumers. He named the company Anker, after the German word for ship anchor. The steady rise of the company’s profile is proof that it’s possible to meet one very specific consumer need and ride that wave Anker has since become the most popular brand of portable battery packs on Amazon. Portable chargers had a bit of a standout moment last summer, when players of the wildly popular and battery-hogging Pokémon Go could be seen roaming the streets, their phones constantly plugged in. But these accessories have existed for years as a remedy for our battery woes since the standard smartphone tends to last no more than a day on a single charge. So in airports, the back of cabs, and on city streets we’re plugging into lithium-ion slabs in our pockets and bags to stay connected. The market for portable battery packs generated $360 million in the 12 months ending in March 2017 in the US alone. The brands behind these packs are largely anonymous — Kmashi, Jackery, and iMuto — and they often stay that way. Except Anker. The steady rise of the company’s profile is proof that it’s possible to meet one very specific consumer need and ride that wave as it continues to ripple out to other markets. A majority of Anker’s sales come from cables and wall chargers, and it’s now moving into the smart home and auto market — anywhere a plug and a cable can solve a problem. Yang and his team started a company with the sole purpose of selling a better third-party accessory. But they stumbled onto a more lucrative reality: mobile phones, once niche luxury items, are now ubiquitous centerpieces of our digital lives. Each of these phones, and all the products that connect to them, need their own cable and plug. And each and every day these devices die before we want them to. PowerCore 10000. If there’s anything you should know about smartphone development over the last 10 years, it’s this: batteries are not lasting longer. Phones may be thinner and faster, with larger screens and better cameras, but they don’t stay powered for longer than a day, perhaps 36 hours at best. The culprit is the fundamental science of lithium-ion batteries, which are tremendous at storing energy but only within limited size and capacity constraints. The lithium-ion batteries we have today operate at about a fifth of their potential storage capacity, says Lynden Archer, a professor of chemical engineering at Cornell University. And yet that’s still at about 90 percent of the maximum potential today’s battery science allows. “A breakthrough would require a new paradigm,” he says. “A huge part of Anker’s success is the fact that our batteries don’t last long enough.” That stagnation has allowed Anker to flourish. “A huge part of Anker’s success is the fact that our batteries don’t last long enough,” says Joanna Stern, a technology columnist and gadget reviewer for The Wall Street Journal. “They saw that accessories needed to be made to address customers’ pain points. They’re making the chargers, the cases, the cords — and they’re making it for affordable prices so you can have one of these in every place you are.” Mobile battery packs weren’t the company’s initial goal. In the late 2000s, Yang identified a consumer need not being met: well-built, reliable laptop battery replacements. “You have a Dell or HP laptop — let’s assume you got it in 2009 — and in 2011 the battery is dying and you want to get a new one,” he says. Back then you had two choices: buy directly from Dell or HP, with a high price tag, or buy a white-label battery that’s cheap but poorly made. “Which one do I want to buy?” asks Yang. “The answer is neither of them.” Yang saw a desire for a better type of accessory — one that wouldn’t cost as much as a replacement straight from the original manufacturer, but that would be of a high enough quality to earn consumers’ trust. Before he could sell that product, he needed to figure out how to make it. It was a long and painful process. After he quit his job at Google in July 2011, Anker took 12 months just to prototype its first laptop battery. That was even after Yang and the core team moved to Shenzhen to find reliable manufacturing partners. “I knew that if I stayed in California and had people FedEx me prototypes in a week, it was just not going to work,” he says. Many hardware companies, especially crowdfunded ones in the US, learn that lesson the hard way, missing deadlines and hitting snags that lead to months-long delays. A solid supply chain is so crucial to a hardware company’s survival that there’s an entire consulting industry around helping startups find suppliers and set expectations. Critical to avoiding these pitfalls was Dongpong Zhao, Google’s then-head of sales in China. Zhao joined Anker in early 2012, and helped Yang build out the company’s supply chain. Anker was made up of around ten people at the time. “Think of it as a small family business instead of like an actual company,” Yang says. The company tirelessly built out a supply chain in its first year and began testing its first products — the laptop chargers and batteries it would begin selling direct to consumers on Amazon. “We were able to make cellphone battery cells that actually had slightly better capacity. That got us quite the reputation.” From there, Anker ventured into smartphone batteries with a replacement unit for the HTC Sensation. “We were able to make cellphone battery cells that actually had slightly better capacity,” Yang says. “That got us quite the reputation.” Early on, Anker developed close relationships with suppliers in Asia, including Panasonic and anode supplier BTR, to help test and quickly develop new batteries. Yang says he and Anker’s small team “definitely saw the explosion of smart devices” as its biggest and most obvious opportunity, and Anker started aggressively expanding into portable battery packs, wall chargers, and cables. By the end of 2012, after shifting more resources toward portable chargers, Yang says Anker went from selling 100 to 1,000 products per day. “The challenge wasn’t selling products,” Yang says. “It was making products and making sure they were high-quality as well. That’s why we spent a majority of our effort on R&D and product development.” The company does a majority of its sales directly to consumers over Amazon Marketplace, where a combination of strong reviews, low prices, and prominent placement in search rankings can turn a single product into a lucrative line. For the accessories market, which tends to piggyback off trends in mainstream consumer electronics, a true breakthrough is rare. But Anker found one in charging, based on the realization that while batteries may not be improving, charging time certainly was. According a study conducted last year by PhoneArena, it took more than two hours on average to charge a device to 100 percent in 2013. Today, it can be done in almost half the time. So Anker set out to make the fastest chargers available. Take the PowerPort 5, a matte black rectangle no larger than a deck of playing cards, with five USB ports. When it was first introduced in 2015, it was the only accessory on the market capable of charging five devices simultaneously at optimal speed. Or the company’s standard PowerCore portable charger, roughly the size of a credit card and just under one inch thick — a white block encasing 10,000mAh of lithium-ion battery cells. It has four pinholes that light up in LED blue when you press an elliptical button on the top to check its remaining charge. It can refill a depleted iPhone 7 in just over 60 minutes nearly four times over before it needs to be recharged. Most Anker charging products have one signature: the PowerIQ logo. Launched in 2013, the company’s proprietary charging standard is now present on nearly all of its batteries and wall plugs. The technology, carried by a small chip inside each charger, identifies whatever device is being plugged in, be it an iPhone 7 Plus, Google Pixel, or an iPad Pro 9.7-inch, in order to detect and deliver the maximum current the product allows. Anker says the technology can shave hours off the amount of time it takes to reach a full charge. A next-generation version of the chip, a sequel to PowerIQ, is slated to start shipping in new Anker charging products later this year, allowing for smaller and lighter accessories. On top of its products’ technical advantages, Anker banks on looks to make its chargers stand out. Brand manager Elisa Lu says every device’s packaging is carefully thought out from the moment customers receive the product, to when they open it and use it. Devices come in a white-and-light-blue box with the name Anker printed in all caps across the front. Inside is a meticulously packaged arrangement of lightweight cardboard. Anker products carry that new gadget smell — a blend of peculiar odors from the evaporation of chemical compounds in the plastics and the epoxy coatings of the device. Beside its red cables, which Anker offers in both standard and braided nylon versions, and a single one-off red battery pack, the company sells products in only two color options: black and white. All this has a strategic business purpose. “When our consumers receive our products, we want to make sure they know they are getting it from a reliable and trustworthy company,” Lu says. Brand trust is a pivotal consideration when purchasing what may seem like random electronics off Amazon. Inside the the box with Anker’s larger products, you’ll also find a small square piece of paper with two questions: are you happy, or are you unhappy? If you’re unhappy, a block of text instructs you to contact Anker customer support via phone, email, or on its website. If you’re satisfied, it asks you to tell your friends or family. Better yet, leave an Amazon review. PowerCore Slim 5000. In many ways, Anker’s success is born from the failures of premier manufacturers like Apple and Samsung. Where those companies introduce points of friction — like ever-thinner devices with short battery lives — Anker offers a remedy. “My feeling is that Anker is a success because Apple offers such subpar and expensive accessories,” says Stern, who’s often recommended Anker products in her WSJ column. It may be surprising that Apple sat idly as the accessory market ballooned around it; it took the company years to develop its own battery case for the iPhone to compete with Mophie. But Apple has always favored high margins on premium products, even the cables and earbuds it sells in the Apple Store. This has given ample room to companies like Anker, with the low overhead of an e-commerce business, to sell similar products of near-identical quality for $10 to $20 cheaper. And where Apple and others failed to develop products of their own like multi-port wall plugs and portable chargers, Anker saw the opportunity and capitalized on it. The company is quick to fill gaps created by smartphone manufacturers. When Apple removed the headphone jack on the iPhone 7, for instance, Anker saw a giant opportunity to begin producing new dongles and other cable adapters to help consumers adjust. But mastering Amazon was the real key to securing Anker’s future. Search for a generic accessory like “cellphone wall charger” or “Lightning cable” and you’ll find the Anker brand high up in the search results If you head over to Amazon.com right now and peruse the retailer’s most popular smartphone accessories and you’ll find Anker products at the top. Search for a generic accessory like “cellphone wall charger” or “Lightning cable” and you’ll find the Anker brand high up in the search results, typically with a 4.5 or 5-star rating. In fact, Anker products take up the first five slots on Amazon’s list of best-selling portable batteries. And alongside the ratings, you’ll find thousands of customer reviews — reviews that the company scans meticulously for ideas on how to improve their development process. Two years before he left Google, Yang became intimately familiar with Amazon’s Marketplace when he built an automated system for a friend who was selling third-party products on Amazon as a side business. It essentially took care of aspects of the business like inventory, logistics and fulfillment, and sales tracking. “It took me two months, evenings and weekends, to develop this system,” Yang explained in a video produced by Amazon last year to promote entrepreneurship on its platform. “Within a month, she was fulfilling 300 orders a day.” Building this system gave Yang invaluable insight into how third-party selling on Amazon functioned. He discovered what worked and what didn’t, and how entire brands could crop up overnight and fade into obscurity the next day. Anker thrived by borrowing infrastructure from Amazon and relying on engineering and support in China. “Amazon provides loads of services — financial services, fulfillment. It actually makes selling a low-barrier thing,” Yang says. Although the company attempted to handle its own fulfillment in its early days, it eventually discovered it could not compete with what Amazon offered. Now, about 95 percent of Anker’s products are listed as “Fulfilled by Amazon.” You can build an online retail business off Amazon, but making sure your products get exposure is the hard part. “The biggest challenge for Anker is not sales. It’s customer perception,” Yang says. “People think they need [Apple’s] cube charger and stock cable.” Teaching people that there is a superior product out there, and then convincing them to keep buying, is Anker’s core challenge. “Amazon reviews were really enormously helpful,” Yang says. “The Amazon reviews just come and come automatically.” PowerLine+ USB-C to USB 3.0. Silicon Valley is full of breathless mission statements designed to inspire and justify the power and influence of technology, like Apple’s famous “think different” slogan, and Google’s ominous and now defunct “don’t be evil” mantra. Facebook, back in 2012, celebrated its billion-user milestone with an ad comparing the social network to chairs, bridges, and even nations. Anker has never aspired to such grand ambitions. “At Anker, we can't exactly help you unwind,” the company admits on its Amazon sellers page. Instead, Anker takes a more straightforward approach by solving the inevitable problems technology creates. “Say goodbye to first-world tech woes like oppressive low batteries and limited ports,” the page says. “Say hello to an easier, smarter life.” Yang is trying to extend this simple philosophy to categories like headphones, speakers, phone cases, and now smart home appliances under a new brand called Eufy. Launched last September, Eufy is Anker’s avenue for selling things like Roomba clones, desk lamps, and bathroom scales. Expanding into more product categories is a logical evolution for Anker, but it’s also a response to a looming existential threat: Yang says he foresees a future where portable chargers won’t be necessary due to advancements in both fast charging and wireless charging. “I think we all agree that the portable charger isn’t forever,” Yang says. But consumers will always need wall plugs and cables, and Anker sees its goal now as keeping pace with changing standards, like the introduction of USB-C. PowerCore 5000. In the meantime, Yang says it’s diversifying with a future expansion into audio, smart home, and automotive product lines. Anker already produces Bluetooth headphones and speakers, but it has aspirations to compete with the likes of Harman Kardon and Bose. Key to the success of those products is moving to brick-and-mortar retailers. Terrence Wang, the company’s chief marketing officer hired from Procter & Gamble in 2015, says having a presence in Best Buy and Walmart, a process that began last year, is the next stage of Anker’s evolution. “Expanding from online to offline is critical actually,” Wang says. “We are trying to get as many people to know that they have a simple, convenient, portable, fast solution rather than just have to bring their own charger wherever they go. That’s the original brand vision.” The company’s focus on storefront retail is a response to a second very real threat — dependence on a direct-to-consumer, online-only model. The company has found it difficult these days to launch new products on Amazon. Older products have thousands of reviews, while newer ones need to earn placement in the search rankings and collect testimonials before more cautious buyers pull the trigger. “We’re seeing a bit of a dilemma on that one,” Yang says. “To a lot of people, the original charger and the original cable are the only means to charge their devices.” The company is also struggling with its complex product line, with a dizzying number of choices that may alienate consumers who are looking for a simple choice. “We’re converging to this generation approach,” Yang says. “So we’ll try to release a generation of products every 18 to 24 months.” Choosing which products to promote at Best Buy, which to discontinue, and where to put resources for the future are all part of Anker’s growing pains. The company’s success hinges on convincing — or “educating” — their consumers about the value of what they’re offering. Yang likes to tell a story about a moment he sees play out on repeat every single time he’s at an airport, anywhere on the planet. He sees people, smartphones in hand, rushing from outlet to outlet, looking for space with “the little Apple cube in their hands” and running out of options. “To a lot of people, the original charger and the original cable are the only means to charge their devices, in their mind,” he says. “I look at those people and I always want to go up to them and talk to them.” Instead, Yang and the Anker team started conducting an annual consumer survey. It has only one question: how often does your smartphone run out of battery? Once every day? Once a week? Once a month? Or perhaps never? “Forty percent of people say their battery ran out at least once last week, another 40 percent say at least once last month,” Yang says. “As long as these numbers don’t go down, I think we have a lot of work to do.” Good Deals Amazon Echo Dot flash deal: $10 off, today only Apple Apple reportedly plans to perform 5G internet tests in Cupertino Circuit Breaker Prynt made another printer that turns photos into AR video experiences View all stories in Tech Loading comments...
