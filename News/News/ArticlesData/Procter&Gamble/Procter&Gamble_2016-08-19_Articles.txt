View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20160819005283/en/ Photo courtesy of Procter & Gamble WHO:   Families, individuals and first responders in need of personal care items, cleaning products or laundry services in the wake of the recent historic flooding in Louisiana.   WHAT: The Tide Loads of Hope fleet will be deployed to support the relief efforts in Louisiana. The early-responder Tide Loads of Hope mobile laundry vehicle will be the first to arrive and will begin laundry services on August 19th, providing free full-service laundry to residents in Louisiana affected by the recent flooding. Residents can bring clothes (up to two loads per household) to the mobile unit to be washed, dried and folded free of charge for those in the directly affected areas. All washable clothing types can be accepted with the exception of heavy bedding. In addition, P&G will also be providing personal care kits containing items such as Secret deodorant, Crest toothpaste and Pantene shampoo as well as household cleaning products like Bounty, Mr. Clean and Swiffer. The extended capacity semi-truck is also en route to support relief efforts and will be on location next week with date and location to-be-determined. For the most up-to-date information on the fleet’s location and timing, please visit Tide’s Facebook and Twitter channels at https://www.facebook.com/Tide or @Tide.   WHY: Historic storms hit southern Louisiana and Mississippi between August 10th and 13th, devastating thousands of families and homes. As many residents have been forced from their homes, they are currently without basic needs and resources. P&G has a history of giving back to the communities where we live and work, and we wanted to provide some everyday essentials to those who need it most. These services are free and available to people affected by the disaster and the volunteers that are helping to respond.   WHERE: The early-responder Tide Loads of Hope mobile laundry unit will be located at:   Bethany Church South Campus 10877 Reiger Road, Baton Rouge, LA 70809   P&G products will be distributed directly to residents in this area as well as from the Bethany Church South Campus location. Stay tuned for updates on the fleet’s location including details regarding the extended capacity Tide Loads of Hope semi-truck on Tide’s Facebook and Twitter channels at https://www.facebook.com/Tide or @Tide.   WHEN: Beginning Friday, August 19th, up to 100 loads of laundry per day (two loads per household) will be collected from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. at the Bethany Church South Campus location. Stay tuned for the location of the extended capacity semi-truck which will be able to accommodate 300 loads of laundry per day (two loads per household).   ABOUT TIDE LOADS OF HOPE: In 2005, P&G launched Tide Loads of Hope to provide much needed laundry services to families affected by Hurricane Katrina. Since that time, Tide Loads of Hope has washed more than 60,000 loads of laundry for more than 45,000 families impacted by disasters around the world. The early-responder Tide Loads of Hope mobile laundry unit is outfitted with 12 high-efficiency Whirlpool Duet washers and dryers (six of each) with the capacity to do up to 100 loads of laundry a day. The extended capacity semi-truck is outfitted with 32 energy-efficient Whirlpool washers (16 of each) with the capacity to do up to 300 loads of laundry a day.   BRANDS: Brands included in relief effort: Always, Bounty, Crest, Charmin, Dawn, Febreze, Ivory, Gillette, Mr. Clean, Old Spice, Oral-B, Pampers, Pantene, Secret, Swiffer, Tide, and Venus.   PARTNER: P&G provides these services in partnership with Matthew 25: Ministries, an international humanitarian aid and disaster relief organization.

Authorities said Joseph Bartorillo secretly injected semen into yogurt two female co-workers brought for lunch at the Procter & Gamble paper products facility in Wyoming County. Details continued to emerge Wednesday in the case that came to light Tuesday when federal prosecutors announced the 60-year-old was facing food tampering charges in the plot. Wyoming County District Attorney Jeff Mitchell vowed Mr. Bartorillo would face more charges on the state level. Mr. Bartorillo, a veteran employee, has no criminal history. "The victims began to notice something was wrong with their yogurts - there were pin marks," Mr. Mitchell explained, noting the yogurt also smelled and tasted bad. Authorities are still trying to determine a motive for the crime, which occurred at least 13 times between July 2010 and May of this year, the district attorney said. Mr. Mitchell stressed that no Procter & Gamble products were contaminated. Alex Fried, spokesman at Procter & Gamble's plant in Washington Twp., said Mr. Bartorillo is no longer an employee. Mr. Fried also wouldn't say how Mr. Bartorillo was caught. In a news release Tuesday, U.S. Attorney Peter Smith noted that all of the tainted containers were recovered and the public was not in danger. Court documents filed in the case indicate Mr. Bartorillo reached a plea deal with prosecutors that calls for a two-year federal prison sentence. A judge could reject Mr. Bartorillo's plea with federal officials and sentence him up to 10 years in federal prison, court documents say. Attempts to reach Mr. Bartorillo on Wednesday at his home in Larksville were unsuccessful.

P&G has one less billion-dollar brand Alexander Coolidge , acoolidge@enquirer.com 2:07 p.m. EDT August 19, 2016 An overseas ad for Prestobarba. (Photo: Provided) Procter & Gamble is blaming currency woes for cutting one of its billion-dollar brands from that elite roster. Prestobarba, a disposable razor brand sold in Latin America, Europe, Asia and the Middle East, saw fiscal year sales dip below 10 digits, company officials said. The slump means the Cincinnati-based consumer products giant now has 20 billion-dollar brands, compared with 22 a year ago. For the first time in years, P&G has stopped listing its "billion-dollar brands" in its annual 10-K report to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Instead, it lists 32 "major brands" with sales north of $500 million. Prestobarba remains a "major" brand by that definition. Company officials acknowledged the classification changes when asked this week. Another billion-dollar brand, hair color Wella, has also been removed from its billion-dollar list because it is part of the pending $15 billion divestiture to New York-based Coty, which is acquiring 40 P&G beauty brands this fall. Prestobarba became a billion-dollar P&G brand in 2013 – becoming the company's second brand sold all or mostly overseas to hit 10 digits as international sales continued to fuel Procter's growth. The first was high-end skin care brand SK II, which sells in U.S. department stores, but started as an Asian blockbuster. But plummeting currency values across the globe have sapped P&G's revenues, costing the company $4.2 billion in lost sales in the fiscal year that ended June 30. Central banks in overseas markets have devalued their money against the U.S. dollar to prop up exports and boost their local economies. However, countries that do that inflict higher domestic inflation for local consumers, which hurts demand. It also increases the cost of doing business in those countries. What sales are finally booked are converted to fewer dollars. The last P&G brand to fall off the billion-dollar list was Braun electric razors three years ago after the company sold off part of the business, exiting the kitchen gadgets business. Braun and Prestobarba are now called "leadership brands" with sales between $500 million and $1 billion. P&G's other leadership brands are shampoo brand Rejoice, sold in Asia; Old Spice men's deodorant; Safeguard soap; Prilosec OTC heartburn medication; Cascade dishwashing detergent; Venus razors; Mr. Clean household cleaner; Swiffer dust mops; Luvs diapers; and Tampax tampons. P&G's remaining billion-dollar brands are Always pantyliners; Ariel, Gain and Tide laundry detergents; Bounty paper towels; Charmin toilet paper; Crest toothpaste; Dawn dish soap; Downy fabric softener; Febreze fabric and air freshener; Fusion, Gillette and Mach3 razors; Head & Shoulders and Pantene shampoos; Olay and SK-II skin care; Oral-B toothbrushes; Pampers diapers; and Vicks cough medicine. 5 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://cin.ci/2bHIjnn TOP VIDEOS Cincinnati.com Prep Sports 360 for Nov. 22 17:46 Joe Deters asks for retrial of Ray Tensing, seeks change of venue 3:07 Black Friday secrets the stores don't want you to know 1:01 Finding home: A 12-year-old boy's search in the midst of war 6:41 Bills-Bengals postgame wrap 3:10 Bengals vs. Bills Week 11 predictions 6:02 Cincinnati.com Prep Sports 360 for Nov. 15. 20:46 Supermoon rises over Cincinnati 0:55 Bengals vs. Giants wrap-up 3:15 The day Ray Tensing's murder case was declared a mistrial: 'The world was watching Cincinnati' 3:46 DuBose family reacts to news of mistrial 1:35 Tensing jury submits a question: Define 'arrest' 2:08 DuBose Fiancée still feels 'confident that a murder conviction will come' 0:48 Tensing jury can't agree on verdict, judge orders more deliberation 2:39 Bengals vs. Giants Week 10 Prediction 4:59 Cincinnati.com Prep Sports 360 for Nov. 8 18:29 Jeff Ruby: 'I sense there is not going to be justice' for the DuBose family 2:18 Deters on Tensing crying on the stand: ‘The place to be upset... was after you just blew someone's brains out' 26:55 Defense makes its closing arguments in the Tensing Trial 41:26 Prosecution makes its closing arguments in the Tensing Trial 26:35 Tensing: 'Oh my God, he's going to run me over, he's going to kill me' 12:03 Use-of-force expert: 'The actions of Ray Tensing were justified' 0:50 Which stores are opening, closing Thanksgiving Day 0:34 \u0022I can't wait to see Tensing on the stand\u0022 0:55 Cincinnati Police Criminalist: Tensing 'seemed nervous or afraid' 2:59

Demitrios Kalogeropoulos (TMFSigma) Aug 19, 2016 at 8:10AM Image source: Getty Images. Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) closed out its fiscal 2016 on an upbeat note, having managed just its second improvement in organic sales growth in nearly three years. The consumer goods giant also booked encouraging volume gains in each of its five key product divisions. However, P&G came up far short in two of its fundamental business goals over the past 12 months. And unless it can turn the tide on these metrics, the stock is likely to underperform the market from here. The retailer's competitive strategy is simple: Use a deep portfolio of blockbuster brands -- in combination with a world-class selling infrastructure -- to deliver increasing returns to shareholders. There are three financial metrics that form the foundation for that lucrative model: organic sales, profits, and cash flow. As executives explain in the 10-K report, P&G aims to 1) improve sales at above-market growth rates; 2) generate high-single-digit earnings gains; and 3) produce free cash flow that's at least 90% of adjusted profits. The company didn't deliver on its first two targets this year. Market-share losses Organic sales grew at a 1% pace in fiscal 2016, marking the second straight year of deceleration on this metric (growth was 2% and 3% in 2015 and 2014, respectively). Rivals Unilever (NYSE:UL) and Kimberly-Clark (NYSE:KMB), in contrast, have been growing at between 3% and 5% as of late. By P&G's estimate, the company lost global market share in each of its major product categories, with the exception of fabric and home care, which was flat: Category Market-Share Change Beauty (1%) Grooming (1%) Healthcare (1%) Fabric and home care N/A Baby, feminine, and family care (1%) Source: P&G financial filings. The flat result in fabric is encouraging, given that it is P&G's biggest, most profitable segment. Executives hope to apply the innovation and advertising successes they've managed there to other areas of the business. Investors can judge the success or failure of those initiatives by watching the company's organic growth rates over the next few quarters. P&G aims to speed up to a 2% pace in fiscal 2017, which implies at least steady market share in its key competitive markets. Earnings declines Rather than highlighting reported per-share profits, which can fluctuate wildly in a period of major portfolio changes like this, management focuses on what they call core earnings. Instead of rising at a consistent 6% to 8% clip, this metric started low in 2014 and has gotten worse since then. Image source: P&G investor presentation. The picture improves markedly when you adjust for foreign-currency swings. By that measure, gains in core earnings per share were 7% in fiscal 2016. However, that was down from 14% in 2014 and 11% in 2015. P&G has more control over this metric since cost cuts can power improvements even if sales growth rates are weak. And that's exactly what's happened lately. The company has sliced billions of dollars out of its expense structure and plans to deliver another $10 billion of savings over the next five years. For the coming fiscal year, meanwhile, P&G believes it can get back on its long-term growth track by generating core EPS gains of around 6%. Cash flow for the win Thanks in part to those aggressive cost cuts, P&G nailed its third core financial goal. Adjusted free-cash-flow productivity amounted to 115% this year, compared to the 90% annual target that CEO David Taylor and his executive team strive to hit. As a result, the company is in a good position to fund increasing cash returns to shareholders over the next few years. Long term, share repurchases and dividend spending will need an assist from higher sales and profit growth. Robust organic growth is a must for P&G to claim it has truly recovered its long-term expansion pace. Demitrios Kalogeropoulos has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Duke Energy's campaign contribution pipeline Carrie Blackmore Smith , csmith@enquirer.com 11:33 a.m. EDT August 25, 2016 Buy Photo Duke Ohio-Kentucky President Jim Henning (center) addressed elected officials and community members during a meeting at the Sharonville Convention Center July 27. Henning is at the top of the list for Duke employees that have made campaign contributions to Ohio politicians since 2010. To his left is Hamilton County Commissioner Chris Monzel. A review by The Enquirer of contributions showed Monzel has not received any contributions from Duke employees or its political action committee. (Photo: Enquirer file/Kareem Elgazzar)Buy Photo If its political contributions are any indication, Duke Energy likes Republicans – the more powerful the better. The Enquirer delved into donations from Duke's political action committee and individual employees as the corporation prepares to ask permission from the state to build the largest natural gas pipeline ever built in Hamilton County, a plan with swelling local opposition. Duke plans to submit an application by Sept. 13. First, a little about the project Duke hopes to construct a 12-14 mile, high-pressure natural gas pipeline through 14 Hamilton County communities, including densely populated parts of Blue Ash, Norwood, Sycamore Township and parts of Cincinnati. Opponents believe a pipeline should never be built in such a populated area, particularly because more stringent federal safety regulations are currently being worked out, in light of deadly explosions around the country. Duke officials say this pipeline is necessary to keep up with future demands for natural gas. They share examples of large pipelines they've built successfully with good safety records. They say this section of pipe is only in Ohio, so it is an intrastate pipeline and therefore falls within state jurisdiction. What The Enquirer did The Enquirer decided to find out what kind of money Duke's employees, through their PAC or individually, gave to politicians along the proposed pipeline route. While the decision is ultimately up to an independent board, elected officials wield influence in many ways. These are perfectly legal contributions and Duke has lots of other projects and reasons for financially supporting candidates. The Enquirer isn't suggesting the company made these donations simply because of the ongoing pipeline debate. The fact that Duke gave to Republicans – and to the most powerful – is not surprising in itself. The GOP controls every statewide office and both houses in the General Assembly, something not expected to change this November. Ohio Sen. Bill Seitz, R-Green Township, who is at the top of the list, called what he got "chump change." A Duke spokesman said the findings indicate the Duke PAC believes these candidates best represent their values and understand what they need to do their work and want to keep them in office. Here's what we found in a review of political contributions from January 2014 through July 2016. Who got what from Duke? Here's what politicians representing Butler, Clermont, Hamilton and Warren counties got from Duke's PAC, according to an Enquirer review of donations from January 2014 to July 2016. Infogr.am  (Photo: Carrie Blackmore Smith) We found that nearly every state-level politician representing Southwest Ohio received some funding from the Duke PAC and those with the most power in the state got the most money. In all, the Duke PAC gave more than $232,000 to political committees in Ohio from January 2014 to July 2016. That's less than some other public utility PACs, including FirstEnergy's $1.1 million, American Electric Power's $450,465 and Time Warner Cable's $448,091. But it's far more than PACs or political contributing entities for say, the University of Cincinnati chapter of the American Association of University Professors or Procter & Gamble, which gave $46,005 and $23,500 respectively over the last 2½ years. Every politician representing Southwest Ohio got a slice, with the exception of state representatives Christie Bryant Kuhns, D-Northside, and Paul Zeltwanger, R-Mason. The 11 politicians below got 40 percent of Duke's donations and are the most powerful in the state.   These 11 politicians, the most powerful in state government, got the most in campaign contributions from Duke, according to an Enquirer review of donations from January 2014 to July 2016. Infogr.am  (Photo: Carrie Blackmore Smith) Duke employees up the ante It’s not only the Duke's PAC making campaign contributions. Duke employees make them, too. One of the top donors in the last six years was James Henning, president of Duke Energy’s utility operations in Ohio and Kentucky. Those who attended the pipeline panel discussion at the Sharonville Convention Center in July will recognize him. He made personal donations to Gov. John Kasich, Senate President Keith Faber, former Speaker of the House William Batchelder and former State Rep. Peter Stautberg, a Republican from Anderson Township, who is now an appellate judge in Hamilton County. Duke employees also made individual donations to Ohio politicians, according to an Enquirer review of political contributions from January 2014 to July 2016. Infogr.am  (Photo: Carrie Blackmore Smith) Sen. Bill Seitz disappoints opponents Pipeline opponents are frustrated with Sen. Bill Seitz, who has remained neutral on the topic. Seitz said Duke has not yet filed an application with project specifics so doing so would be "premature." Seitz lives in Green Township but he represents much of the area where the pipeline is proposed. Other politicians with constituents affected by the routes, such as state representatives Jonathan Dever, a Republican, and Denise Driehaus, a Democrat, have declared their opposition. Hamilton County Commissioners and Cincinnati City Council have pledged to legally fight Duke if it moves forward with what has been suggested. The full list of communities that could be affected is Blue Ash, Amberley Village, Golf Manor, Evendale, Madeira, Deer Park, Montgomery, Reading, Silverton, Sycamore Township, Norwood, Fairfax, Columbia Township and the Cincinnati neighborhoods of Madisonville and Pleasant Ridge. As chair of the Senate's Public Utilities Committee, Seitz relationship with public utilities in the state is more complicated than most. His committee regulates and oversees providers of gas, electric, cable television and telephone services and it makes recommendations to the full Senate on the governor's appointments to the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio, which has the same staff as the Ohio Power Siting Board. Those state employees are responsible for vetting Duke's proposal for the independent board to decide whether a large pipeline can be built. Seitz argues "the legislature has absolutely nothing to do with the location of this pipeline." "The more people print stories like this the more people see black helicopters where there are none," Seitz said. All of his top contributors are tied to the gas and electric industry, but Seitz said that's likely true of any politician who chairs the Senate or House public utilities committees. Duke Energy PAC was one of the five top donors to Sen. Bill Seitz's political committee. All of the top donors are in the electric and gas industries. Infogr.am  (Photo: Carrie Blackmore Smith) Seitz's term limit is up this year, so his influence going forward will change. However, he and State Rep. Lou Terhar are running for one another’s seats this fall. Unlike Seitz, Terhar has been in attendance at local pipeline meetings, including a meeting held by Neighbors Opposing the Pipeline Extension. State Rep. Lou Terhar (left) and Sen. Bill Seitz are running for one another's seats this fall.  (Photo: Provided/Meg Vogel) Seitz said he could oppose it, but will reserve judgment until Duke submits its application, despite countless city, township and village leaders along the pipeline begging Duke to drop the idea altogether. The public might also want to know, for context, how Duke contributions stack up next to other utility companies and local corporations. When compared to other large utilities, the per customer breakdown is 18 cents from Duke; 55 cents from FirstEnergy (which serves much of Northern Ohio) and 30 cents from AEP (which serves Southeast and Central parts of Ohio). Republicans dominate Not just the candidates, but also GOP organizations. In fact, The Enquirer analysis showed more money was given to the Hamilton County GOP Golf Outing than to former Democratic Gov. Ted Strickland. When reviewing party-affiliated contributions, Republicans got 92 percent of Duke Energy PAC's donations. Infogr.am  (Photo: Carrie Blackmore Smith) Brad Miller, spokesman for the Ohio House Republican Organizational Committee noted: "Any individual or group is free to contribute to political campaigns. But under no circumstances do campaign contributions dictate policy decisions." Other power companies donate more than Duke Other power companies gave more to Ohio politicians than Duke's PAC, according to an Enquirer review of donations from January 2014 to July 2016. Infogr.am  (Photo: Carrie Blackmore Smith) The Enquirer also reviewed donations to local elected officials in the communities along the pipeline and found no donations to any of them from the Duke PAC, aside from Cincinnati Mayor John Cranley, who got $2,500 in the last 30 months. Duke officials noted that the Duke PAC generates its donations from voluntary employee contributions and is one of over 3,800 federal PACs and thousands of state PACs. Political "decisions affect our customers, employees and shareholders," said Lee J. Freedman, a spokesperson for Duke. "That’s why it’s critical that we help elect decision-makers who understand our industry and our point of view." Editor's note: An earlier version of this article incorrectly listed an amount of donations for the University of Cincinnati PAC. The university does not have a PAC. The contributions had been made by the University of Cincinnati chapter of the American Association of University Professors.  220 CONNECTTWEET 5 LINKEDIN 13 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://cin.ci/2bKqlRd TOP VIDEOS Who is Nikki Haley? 1:30 Cincinnati.com Prep Sports 360 for Nov. 22 17:46 Joe Deters asks for retrial of Ray Tensing, seeks change of venue 3:07 Finding home: A 12-year-old boy's search in the midst of war 6:41 Bills-Bengals postgame wrap 3:10 La Salle wins regional championship 0:55 911 call: I'm being attacked by bear; I'm going to die 1:05 Joe Deters: \u0022I didn't believe the tears for a second\u0022 2:47 Are deals better on Black Friday or Cyber Monday? 1:00 Bengals vs. Bills Week 11 predictions 6:02 Cincinnati.com Prep Sports 360 for Nov. 15. 20:46 Supermoon rises over Cincinnati 0:55 Bengals vs. Giants wrap-up 3:15 Student at UC Tensing forum: 'It's time for war' 0:45 Sam DuBose sister: 'This, to me, is murder' 1:30 Protests in Cincinnati after Ray Tensing mistrial 1:09 The day Ray Tensing's murder case was declared a mistrial: 'The world was watching Cincinnati' 3:46 DuBose family reacts to news of mistrial 1:35 Mistrial declared in Ray Tensing case 3:46 Tensing jury submits a question: Define 'arrest' 2:08 DuBose Fiancée still feels 'confident that a murder conviction will come' 0:48 Tensing jury can't agree on verdict, judge orders more deliberation 2:39 Bengals vs. Giants Week 10 Prediction 4:59 Most touching ways soldiers reunited with their family 1:17 Cincinnati.com Prep Sports 360 for Nov. 8 18:29

Getty By Cat Harvey-Jenner Aug 20, 2016 1. The athletes village is like a university campus, with a mini bank, post office, and supermarket for their convenience. 2. But it'd be a pretty exotic campus, because this one even has its own little beach for the athletes to feel like they're sunning themselves at Copacabana in the run-up to their competitions. 3. The competing countries' athletes are housed in tall tower blocks, with each nation decorating the outside of their digs with flags to properly mark their territory. Getty Advertisement - Continue Reading Below 4. And they really do get carried away with the patriotism. Record-breaking cyclist Laura Trott told Cosmopolitan UK that the British team's block is "so GB, there's lions and flags all over the place." That said, there's a real feeling of camaraderie between the Olympians, at least if this picture from Team USA's Jake Dalton proves anything: Athletes from all over ✌🏼️ #OlympicVillage #Rio2016 pic.twitter.com/0UOr0yrAHX— Jake Dalton (@jake_dalton) August 1, 2016 5. The athletes had their own little opening ceremony, where they all gathered at the center of the village and welcomed fellow competitors in country by country. The games organizers put on samba dancers and music for it, but this was apparently cut short because of noise complaints from some of the less fun-loving athletes trying to get their sleep. 6. Athletes can get their hair and nails done in a private salon in the village set up by Procter & Gamble (which owns the likes of Aussie, Pantene, Always, and Olay). Nothing like some patriotic nails for a bit of extra luck. Getty 7. Competitors staying at the village are given a food voucher for every meal, just like college meal plans. (Um, sorry, Olympians?) 8. Except there's only one food outlet in the village, and it's McDonalds. Yeah, you'd think it'd be something more like Whole Foods, right? 9. And although you wouldn't think it, McDonalds proved so popular among athletes, there were queues all the way across the concourse. Nothing gets in the way of an athlete who wants a Big Mac for lunch, it seems. And the answer is YES they do have a McDonald's in the Olympic village! Not that I ever eat at McDonald's at home but with ad much salt as they're putting in the food, I'll make an exception! Chicken salad it is for lunch. #olympicvillage #olympics #salad #tryingtoeathealthy #toomuchsalt #fitness #trackandfield #food #doingmybest #olympian #mealofchampions A photo posted by Jarrin Solomon (@jpump44) on Aug 9, 2016 at 10:53am PDT Advertisement - Continue Reading Below 10. Athletes don't have to stay in the Olympic village; it's totally up to their team and how much funding they've got. It's thought that none of the Team USA Olympic team actually stayed there, opting to rent space elsewhere. 11. It's like "being in the Big Brother house," according to Trott. "It's insane, every single person in there wants the same thing; there's like thousands and thousands of people in there and you're all striving for gold medals," she told Cosmopolitan UK. #views 🇧🇷 A photo posted by Gabby Douglas (@gabbycvdouglas) on Jul 27, 2016 at 11:40am PDT Pre-practice Maté sesh in this gorgeous Village 😋 A photo posted by Samuel Mikulak (@samuelmikulak) on Aug 1, 2016 at 7:13am PDT 12. The rooms are actually pretty underwhelming compared to the luxury you might imagine. Each one comes complete with a collapsible wardrobe, a full-length mirror, and a beanbag for all those times they need to chill in between events. Also, the apartments have been plagued by more than their fair share of catastrophes — I'm talking busted toilets, major leaks, and crappy Wi-Fi.) 13. The bedsheets are decorated with the little Rio symbols for all the different events. You know, just in case they wake up and forget where they are. 14. But the beds are far from comfy, with Trott even comparing them to camp beds. In fact, the British cycling team brought their own, because you need a good night's sleep before competing in the Olympics, right? 15. Most athletes have to share rooms, like some kind of hostel. Apparently there can be up to four people per room, so I dread to think what would happen if you got landed with one foghorn of a persistent snorer the night before your big competition. SHUT. UP. 16. But couples don't tend to share together. Famous British cycling couple Laura Trott and Jason Kenny stayed in completely separate apartments, she told Cosmopolitan UK. "We're in different apartments, but they're opposite each other, so I just keep going in there!" 17. The games organizers accounted for some sex going down nonetheless. And they want the athletes to stay safe, it seems, with a staggering 450,000 condoms being located in and around the village. That works out at 42 condoms per athlete. There's even a guy whose job is to walk around and pass out condoms. Well, if safe sex were an Olympic sport, this lot would be raking in the gold medals. 18. Despite the obvious rivalry, tensions don't tend to run too high. "You're all in your separate blocks," says Trott. "The GB team is completely in our own block, although a lot of the smaller nations share." Advertisement - Continue Reading Below 19. And everyone comes out to support each other. "There's a little picnic area out front where everybody goes to watch each other," Trott revealed, adding that there's even a hashtag used among athletes to show unity — #OneTeam. Cute. 20. Everyone travels around the village on bikes. Very eco-friendly! 21. Athletes are seriously careful about hygiene in the village. "It only takes one illness to get into your block to take you all down," Trott told Cosmopolitan UK. "My teammate even wore a mask! That's taking it to an extreme level, but everyone's obsessed with hand sanitizer, and they've even given us this scrub thing they use in hospitals," the gold medalist added. When your team mate takes not getting ill to a whole new level ... @ciarahorne1 😂#shethinksshesadoctor A photo posted by Laura Kenny (@laura_trott31) on Aug 3, 2016 at 4:46am PDT 22. The toilets in the apartments contain signs that remind athletes to shut the lid of the toilet before the flush it to stop germs getting out. Now that is being excessively cautious.

News’ Zuri Hall at the P&G Family Home in Rio. “I’m not sure if I’ll have time.” Still, the 19-year-old powerhouse athlete, standing at 4-foot-9 and weighing in at 104 pounds, is hoping to eventually compete on “DWTS” — once her schedule permits. “I would really love to do it in the spring if that’s possible,” Biles said, of her possibly joining season 24’s cast, should she miss her mark for the fall segment. Earlier this week, a source confirmed to E! News that producers were eyeing the teen athlete, who’s racked up four gold medals, including women’s vault and floor exercise, as well as bronze medal, in the Rio Olympics, as one of the 12 contestants that will compete during the upcoming season. Along with Biles, the dance competition show is rumored to have their sights set on “The Bachelorette’s” JoJo Fletcher and former star of “The Fosters” and “Wizards of Waverly Place” Jake T. Austin. Should Biles join the show for its 24th season in the spring, she’ll be following suit with her gold medalist teammate Aly Raisman, who competed on season 16. Meanwhile, Shawn Johnson won season eight (and came in second on the All-Stars season), and Nastia Liukin took part in season 20. For details on the official cast, mark your calendars, as ABC is set to announce their season 23 front-runners on “Good Morning America” on Tuesday, Aug. 30, with the season premiere airing on Monday, Sept. 12 at 8 p.m. In the meantime, what are your thoughts on the star gymnast joining the dance show?

It's no wonder the success of our athletes has been reported all across the world. Newspapers, social media and TV screens are all filled with well-deserved praise for the Olympians racking up medals faster than most of us could run the 200m. But they're not the only ones who deserve recognition for their hard work – without their mothers, the achievements of our homegrown sports men and women may never have been realised at all. “I don't think people appreciate that,” explains Glenda Trott, ambassador for P&G’s Thank You Mum campaign and mother of GB’s top female athlete, Laura Trott - the only British woman to have four gold medals. “We made a lot of sacrifices. Both our girls are cyclists so when they were growing up, Emma would go in one direction on the M25 with her dad and I'd go in the other direction with Laura. “That was our life, constantly driving around. We didn't have holidays. We would go to places where they had competitions instead, like Manchester and Newport. It was hard as parents. But it's something we've sacrificed and done for our girls. At the end of the day, that's what being a parent is about.” As incredible as it is to be an Olympian, it’s also selfish. Athletes like Mo Farah have spoken about the demanding nature of their career and the impact it can have on friends and family, who are often forced to put their lives on hold for the sake of their loved one. Laura Trott, 24, agrees with this and admits that, during the week of her phenomenal wins, her family was “side-lined” for her career. She’s not the only one. Helen Glover took part in the world’s first live VR press conference from British House at the Rio 2016 Olympic Games hosted by Samsung.  Helen Glover, the rower who just won a gold medal at Rio 2016, is 30-years-old but still regularly calls on her mother for help. “As an athlete you almost lean on your parents longer than normal people - financially sometimes, emotionally, practically,” she explains. “If I call my mum up and say 'what's my national insurance number', she can help. I definitely couldn't function without her.” Both Helen’s parents helped her financially when she made the decision to leave her teaching job in Bath to join Team GB in Reading several years ago. Even after she received lottery funding, they occasionally provided financial assistance. Monetary support from parents can be crucial for young Olympians. Glenda Trott explains that, when Laura started cycling, they were fortunate enough to be able to buy her bike and equipment – which added up to hundreds of pounds.  “Not everyone can do that,” she admits. “It’s a shame there aren’t many schemes in place to help. There might be more budding Olympians out there we don't even know about.” But it’s not just economic support their daughters require – it’s emotional, too. I do get moody before a race. I think everyone around me knows itHelen Glover “They need you the whole time,” stresses Glenda. “Even now Laura’s asking 'what happened in that race, tell me everything'. It's constant. You have to keep thinking. Even in the middle of her events, she was on the phone to me saying 'I can't do this'. “But that's what it about. We take the flack but we have to encourage them: 'No you can do that. Go back to bed, have a couple hours sleep, rethink and come back out'.” For Rachel, the best way to help her daughter Helen can be to stay silent. “We try not to say anything that would upset her,” she tells me. “I frequently say the wrong thing. It’s normally innocuous, like 'this is going well don’t you think?' But if it’s not the right timing, she’ll say, 'not really'.” Helen admits it’s true: “I tend to get very negative so when I speak to her, it’s to verbalise those fears. If I'm worried about wind or something and I share that, they'll know I'll be a bit stressed. Mum doesn't say that much, which is good because it's really easy to say the wrong thing. “She's so good. I can say something and know what I want her to say back - and she'll say it. If she didn't, I'd probably get like, ‘argh why can't you just say that?’ I do get moody before a race. I think everyone around me knows it. If I've gone a bit withdrawn or into myself, they know it's normal. They're very, very patient with me.” Steve Backshall and Helen Glover But the biggest way Helen has leaned on Rachel during the Rio Olympics is by asking her to organise her wedding to TV presenter Steve Backshall. The pair are set to marry in less than a month, and Helen says her mum has ‘pretty much done the wedding planning.’ “Steve and I were happy to wait a year for the summer after the Olympics to get married - but our parents were like, 'what?' So we said that if we were going to do it this year, we'd need help - and my mum was at the front of the queue. She wouldn't let us even look into a wedding planner.” Luckily she ‘trusts her mum’s taste’, but all she knows is that the wedding will be back in Cornwall where she grew up and will reflect hers and Steve’s personalities in that they’re "both quite relaxed, so it will be a nice informal thing.” Laura, too, tells me that her mum has been instrumental in planning her wedding to fellow gold medallist Jason Kenny, which also takes place in September. But wedding planning is nothing compared to what Jess Ennis-Hill asked her mum to do during this Olympics: stay at home to help take care of her two-year-old son, Reggie. “I’m happy to do it,” says her mum, Alison Powell, from Sheffield, where the whole family lives. “Reggie has watched all of the events with his dad. He knows that mum is running and jumping and shooting – he probably thinks all mums do that.” For Jess, it meant she didn’t have to worry about her son missing meals or not sleeping well in Rio, or in a worst case scenario, catching Zika. “I knew it was the right thing for me to come to Rio and him to stay at home with my mum and Andy, so he's in a secure environment and I can come here and concentrate on competing,” she explains.  Jessica Ennis-Hill and her mum, Alison Powell, support P&G's Thank You Mum campaihn “Mum is great and has been so helpful. This has been a completely different Olympics having her at home helping. I'm happy she’s with Reggie, and I can come here and just perform.” She sums up exactly how Laura, Helen and doubtless many other Olympians feel when she says: “My mum’s been with me through my journey. She’s supported me; she got me into athletics and has been amazing from day one. She's always there if I need to ask her for advice or give me a bit of motivation. She’s amazing.” Glenda Trott and Alison Powell are ambassadors for P&G’s 'Thank You, Mum' campaign for the Rio 2016 Olympics Games  Follow The Telegraph READ MORE ABOUT: Jason Kenny Rio Olympics 2016 Weddings Team GB Laura Trott Family Social media Mo Farah Show more Editor's Choice 23 Nov 2016, 5:54pm The Archers' Timothy Watson: 'Psychopath Rob Titchener could find another Helen and strike again'  Premium 23 Nov 2016, 10:31am Apprentice finalist: Nice women don't get ahead at work - take it from me Premium 20 Nov 2016, 7:00am From Bridget Jones to Stranger Things: How 2016 was the year of the comeback queens Premium 20 Nov 2016, 6:00am The parent trap: Why won’t we let our boomerang kids grow up?

By DARREN ROVELL via ESPN Aug 19, 2016, 7:00 PM ET 0 Shares Email Star 0 Shares Email It has been another successful Summer Olympics for Team USA, which handily leads the medal standings. Now come the interesting questions for corporate America. Will Michael Phelps, who has a new family, be motivated to cash in? Which company will win the Simone Biles sweepstakes? Will Katie Ledecky, Simone Manuel and Sydney McLaughlin be lured from school for a financial windfall? Here are my rankings of the endorsement prospects for U.S. Olympic standouts: 1. Michael Phelps, swimmer Although he might be retired, he firmly established himself as the greatest Olympian of all time. Phelps, who has 23 Olympic gold medals, doesn't love making speeches, long the bread and butter of Olympic champions. But he can clean up for years at corporate events. Under Armour couldn't go all out with its marketing of Phelps during the Games, but it will be interesting to see how big they can grow him. Something to watch might be his swimwear partner, Aqua Sphere, trying to grow the "MP" logo and signing swimmers to deals to compete against Speedo and Arena. 2. Simone Biles, gymnast Matich loves that Michigan's play reflects Harbaugh's personality How will Gronk's absence impact Patriots? Remembering the legacy of Ralph Branca Kelly's job is safe with Notre Dame sc The most golden gymnast in a single Olympics with four golds, Biles has a chance to make a mint. Expect her representatives at Octagon, which also represents Phelps, to sign four-year deals that will take her beyond the 2020 Games in Tokyo. Companies have been leery about throwing too much future cash at American gymnastics stars because there's always someone new four years later, but Biles' dominance in Rio will help alleviate that. Don't expect Procter & Gamble, Hershey's or Nike to give up what they already bought in Biles, who has 2.5 million Instagram followers. 3. Katie Ledecky, swimmer Phelps or no Phelps, Ledecky is the most dominant swimmer in the world. She is going to Stanford, which means she can't take any endorsement deals immediately, but perhaps the lesson of Missy Franklin will make Ledecky a free agent sooner. Franklin was a swimming star of the 2012 Games but didn't take money after it so she could swim at Cal. In Rio, she failed to even make an individual final. Ledecky might swim one year at Stanford before turning pro. The swimsuit battle for Ledecky will be the most hotly contested marketing war for a woman that the market has ever seen. 4. Simone Manuel, swimmer A company landing the other "Simone" is hardly a consolation prize. The first African-American swimmer to win an individual gold medal (in the 50-meter freestyle) also attends Stanford, but there's a possibility, like with Ledecky, that she'll quickly move to the pro ranks. Manuel already gave a fun and free post-Olympics endorsement when she returned home and plugged Shipley Do-Nuts on social media. 5. Aly Raisman, gymnast Captain of the gold medal-winning "Fierce Five" in 2012 and "Final Five" in Rio, Raisman will get deals for her strong past (she earned four individual-event medals at the two Games combined) and will have a nice speaking career if she wants. Because of her age, 22, she will likely lose out on some endorsements to younger teammates Madison Kocian and Laurie Hernandez. 6. Ashton Eaton, track and field Eaton capitalized on his first gold in the decathlon in London and was prominently featured by Nike and United leading up to and throughout the Rio Games. While the title of "world's best athlete" is his again, it's really the world's fastest man (100 meters) who draws most of the marketing dollars. But, out of any U.S. Olympian, he is the most impressive in person and will get significant dollars if he chooses to go for a third gold in 2020. 7. Sydney McLaughlin, track and field Continuing the theme of companies not being able to get what they want, McLaughlin -- who just turned 17 -- likely won't turn pro until she finishes high school next year. But with Allyson Felix closing out her career and no one else really emerging on the track the way U.S. swimmers have, McLaughlin is a good investment. In Rio, she made it to the semis in the 400-meter hurdles. 8. Ryan Murphy, swimmer There are plenty of young American female swimmers. Not so much on the men's team. Nathan Adrian is 27, and fellow medalist Anthony Ervin is 35. Ryan Lochte, after his bizarre nonrobbery scandal, isn't getting any new endorsements anytime soon, even if he comes back for 2020. That leaves us with the 21-year-old Murphy, who destroyed the competition on his way to winning gold in the 100- and 200-meter backstrokes. 9. Danell Leyva, gymnast Leyva, who won the bronze in the all-around in London, took home two individual silvers in Rio. He's 24, which means he could be back in 2020. The Cuban native is bilingual, a major plus for brands. 10. Lilly King, swimmer King was upstaged by Ledecky and Manuel, but her bold stance against her main competitor, Russian Yulia Efimova, in the 100-meter breaststroke did two things: It was reminiscent of the old Cold War sports battles, and it was one of the boldest statements an active athlete had ever made about a competitor who had tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs. Efimova tested positive in 2013 and was suspended from the sport. King's stance and victory over Efimova, combined with her sense of nationalism, made her stand out and boosted her Twitter following tenfold in a matter of weeks. King swims at Indiana and, unlike Ledecky and Manuel, the money she might be able to earn in endorsements doesn't figure to make leaving college an absolute no-brainer. 0 Shares Email Star Comments " Which 10 U.S. Olympians have the best endorsement prospects?

(Photo by Alex Livesey/Getty Images) PHOTO: Getty Images Pinterest Facebook As a member of both 2012's #FierceFive and 2016's #FinalFive, Gabby Douglas is no stranger to the Olympic Games, and the spotlight that comes with it. Still in Rio ahead of Sunday's closing ceremony, the P&G Venus spokeswoman made time to talk to Glamour for a quick Q&A about life on Team USA. Glamour: How did you guys celebrate winning team gold in the all-arounds? Gabby Douglas: We kind of didn’t have any time. We had more competitions. We celebrated on the stand! Glamour: What about when the gymnastics events ended? Did you celebrate then? GD: Yes and no. We're all still in Rio...when we get home we'll celebrate fully. Glamour: Then what? Train for Tokyo? GD: Maybe. First the team is going to New York, and then the tour, and then a break from training. Glamour: What are you looking forward to doing during your downtime? GD: I like to hike and play with my dogs and spend time with my family. We go out to family dinners a lot. Pinterest Facebook PHOTO: AFP/Getty Images PHOTO: Getty Images Gabby Douglas competes on the uneven bars in Rio. ||| Glamour: You and Aly Raisman are the only team members who had been to the Olympics before. Did you have advice for Madison Kochian, Simone Biles and Laurie Hernandez? GD: Well...the other girls have experience. They’ve been competing on a lot of international world-class stages. They knew what to expect and what to do and what not to do. Me and Aly just gave them advice on the media side. We said, it’s gonna be crazy. It’s the Olympics. But it’s gonna be fun! Glamour: Do you ever think about what you might be doing if you had never gotten started on gymnastics? Going to high school and college and...just the normal progression? GD: Sometimes I step back and think, wow, who does this? Who has a floor routine? Who works out every day? Who does flips in the air? Who does that? But at the same time, it’s natural. I’ve been doing gymnastics for 16 years.” With golds from multiple games to her name, we'd say those years have paid off. Keywords: Gabby Douglas Olympics Get Glamour In Your Inbox!

That’s where social media influencers come in. These are people who garner huge followings simply on the strength of their personalities, and leverage their fans to make money by endorsing products – or even selling their own. Advertisement By RACHEL WAMBUI More by this Author Do you want to be wealthy and successful in future? You might want to shelve your ambitions of becoming a lawyer, doctor or architect because in today’s world, social media stars are the new currency. Millions of people use the Internet for news, entertainment, to socialise and above all, to keep up with what’s hot, on sale and available to them. That’s where social media influencers come in. These are people who garner huge followings simply on the strength of their personalities, and leverage their fans to make money by endorsing products – or even selling their own. These products could be anything from beauty and fitness products to nightclub appearances and holiday destinations. Fitness guru Jane Mukami and fashion stylist Silvia Njoki are just two Kenyan social media influencers, who have grown their brands purely by clever use of their social media accounts.  THE FITNESS QUEEN: JANE MUKAMI Twitter/Instagram: @fitkenyangirl Website: www.janemukami.com Jane Mukami has a degree in computer information systems from Kennesaw State University (Georgia, USA). She worked in the field from 1999, but a personal decision to lose weight in 2008 led her down an unexpected path, transforming her into a personal fitness brand and one of Kenya’s notable social media influencers. Before it all began “Three years after beginning my personal fitness journey, I discovered I had passion for fitness. My social media posts changed to reflect this and people started sending me messages requesting information on how to get fit. I decided to start blogging in order to share my love for fitness and tips with others.” Seeing the potential “I had no intention to build a fitness brand until Jessica Mutuku (a branding, marketing and monetisation expert) contacted me in 2012. She saw potential that I couldn’t even wrap my mind around at that time. We started working together and in 2014, we launched janemukami.com.” Taking the leap “I remember trying to explain to my mother that I was moving back to Kenya to build a virtual business. She couldn’t understand why I was leaving a well-paying career and a comfortable lifestyle to begin ‘some internet job’. Moving back to Kenya after living in the US for 16 years and kissing my career goodbye was a scary, bold move. But I knew that this is where my market was. I don’t think I ever felt safe (about the move) but I knew I needed to take that risk.”  “The brand’s objective is to help others transform their lives through fitness, health and wellness. It is a fully fledged virtual business. I have a team of people who help me run and manage different aspects. The day-to-day activities involve consulting, posting content, running (fitness) challenges, answering questions, customer support, etc.” The returns “I got my first client in 2012 when I was still in the US – they paid me $250 (Sh25,000) for meal plans and $300 (Sh30,000) per month for personal training. In 2015 the brand started generating enough income for me to quit my job. I have received a lot of business opportunities from corporates, organisations, TV stations, etc, but I am careful to (only) partner with initiatives that are well aligned with my brand. My e-book has sold 10,000 copies in less than a year, on Amazon, all over the world – North America, Australia and 70-plus countries in Europe, Asia and Africa. I’ve had marvelous social and business experiences – like working with the First Lady on the Beyond Zero campaign and having Kevin Harrington, one of the original Sharks from Shark Tank as a partner/advisor, and a member of my board of directors.” The recipe “Authenticity, branding and social media marketing have played a huge role in my brand’s success. Authenticity fosters a real connection with your audience. I don’t feel like I have to be in character when I am in public I don’t walk around with a made-up face or dressed extremely fancy. When eating out, I stick to certain rules but if I am indulging (for example, I love cake!), I share it on social media and let people know that I also indulge once in a while.” Personal brands and virtual businesses “Even though there are only a small number of internet influencers who are reaping the rewards of having a massive presence in Kenya, I think it’s only a matter of time before we get to where the West is. I am pursuing some such opportunities. The only challenge is that corporate clients here are scared of investing adequately because they don’t fully understand the value of social media and its exponential returns on investment.”   __________  THE FASHION GURU: SILVIA NJOKI Twitter/Instagram: @stylesilvia Website: www.silvianjoki.com  When she graduated from the University of Nairobi with a degree in nutrition and food technology, Silvia Njoki didn’t feel like spending the rest of her life in a food lab. The following year, in 2011, she enrolled in a fashion styling course at Central Saint Martin (London) and Nuova Academia di Belle Arti (Milan). She credits her three-year-old daughter, Nielsine, as the inspiration for what would later become a personal brand with a robust digital following.  Before it all began “As a young girl I dreamt of being a fashion designer. Back then I didn’t know what a stylist was but in high school I secretly organised fashion shows for my classmates and styled them using bed sheets, khangas and whatever else was available. I was admitted to Nairobi University on the basis of my grades but while there, I used my free time to attend fashion events and network. By my third year in university, I was interning as a stylist in magazines and TV shows.” The making “I started my blog about  four years ago. My newborn daughter inspired me to create Style by Silvia to showcase her outfits – including some I’d sewn myself. It was an instant hit. The blog transformed into what it is today – a place where I share my styling experience and personal style moments. I also style individuals.” It takes time “It took me close to a year and half before I started making money through endorsements and promotions. You have to start climbing the ladder from the bottom – so at the beginning I was content with earning minimal fees. Eventually, the contracts started trickling in.” Far-reaching opportunities “The discovery of my brand’s international prominence took me by surprise. Some of my most treasured moments this year have been the P&G Future Fabrics event in Barcelona (P&G actually flew me there Business Class!), being invited to Los Angeles as one of the four African bloggers nominated for the Nickelodeon Kids Choice Awards and going to Dakar, Senegal to represent Kenya at the first edition of the Festival of African Bloggers and Youtubers (FABY).” Safety in numbers? “Although my brand has been growing consistently, I still wouldn’t say I feel safe to rely on it as my sole source of income. However, my job as a fashion journalist can sustain me comfortably. I am not required to be there full-time so I can devote myself to growing the brand. Running this online platform is a lot of hard work. Sometimes it occupies my entire day.” Authenticity and the branding of one’s self “I am getting a lot more attention now so I probably wouldn’t walk into a mall looking unkempt. However, the way I dress is really how I want to dress so I feel that I am truly authentic. It takes a lot more than just being on social media to succeed – no matter who I endorse or promote, I want to stay true to myself. Nevertheless, without the full impact of the digital media, my brand wouldn’t enjoy the visibility it does.” Personal brands and virtual businesses – what’s in store in Kenya? “A few of my close friends who are online personalities in Africa have already made it into the millionaires’ club, so we are not so far behind the rest of the (developed) world. I would like to get there as well. The challenge, as in all walks of life, lies in keeping the momentum, especially after you have arrived at the top.”  ********* Vera Sidika She rose to fame on the basis of her ample posterior. Today, her Instagram account, boasting a following of 404,000, describes her as a ‘reality TV star, host, interior designer and entrepreneur’. While her ‘career choice’ might be deemed questionable and aspects of it hazy, news about her always makes for good entertainment. Sidika has managed to capitalise on the buzz around her personality to make enough money to furnish a seemingly lavish lifestyle. Other than hosting parties around the world (in May, she hosted shows in three Chinese cities), she has also launched businesses – among them a hair lounge and a modeling agency. There are talks of an upcoming reality TV show to her name.  Huddah Monroe She has a solid following of 803,000 on Instagram. She first rose to fame on Facebook, posting modelling pictures, and this led to her participation in continental reality show Big Brother Africa in 2013 and a series of semi-nude pictures she later released. Three years later, Monroe, who refers herself as the ‘mistress of all trades’, has become an entrepreneur. In addition to her clothing and lipstick line, international companies riding on the ‘Huddah’ brand have seen her become the brand ambassador for Uber, BrightenMi cosmetics and Chinese telcom company Huawei. One of her newest Instagram video-posts indicates that she has landed the AIDS Healthcare Foundation’s ambassadorship for the love-condoms campaign – an initiative that promotes access, acceptance and usage of condoms to control the spread of HIV/AIDS. Socialite to millionaire (US) The queen of all social media influencers, Kim Kardashian-West, with 79.8 million followers on Instagram and 47.3 million followers on Twitter, used her body to grow that social media following. In 2010, this paid off as she started garnering endorsement deals. She has since gone on to release products to her name. She is now leveraging her social media following to sell products such as her (Kim Kardashian emojis). Her Hollywood mobile game generated $71.8 million in income in 2015. Vlogger to author (UK) A recent entrant into the millionaires’ club, YouTube star Zoe Sugg started out as a beauty vlogger known as Zoella. She is now one of Britain’s most influential tweeps. In 2014, with 6.5 million (now at 11 million plus) subscribers under her belt she published her book, Girl Online. It sold 78,000 copies in its first week and became the fastest selling book of 2014. Three months after her book’s release, she had made enough money to buy a five-bedroom mansion for about $1.5 million. A sequel, Girl Online: On Tour was released in 2015. email print In the headlines Bassira Toure at the double as Mali sent Kenya packing Harambee Starlets on Wednesday bowed out of the running for a place in the Africa Women’s Cup of Kenya 1-3 Mali, AWCON RESULT: Bassira Toure’s double sends Harambee Starlets packing Harambee Starlets take on Mali in their second Group B match at the Omnisport Stadium in Limbe on Kenyans illegally in US told to prepare for the worst — VIDEO Another magistrate attacked in court Detectives pounce on MP upon release MPs storm police station, demand Sarah Korere arrest - PHOTOS Manhunt launched for gang linked to Mumias arms theft This man Mathew Lempurkel Latest: Life and Style Showbiz FBI clears Brad Pitt over abuse claim   Showbiz Kanye suffered mental breakdown: reports   Health, Science and Environment Zika babies can develop microcephaly in first year   DN2 Harambee in action   DN2 #FRONTROW: We need more people like Boniface Mwangi   DN2 CAR CLINIC: Here is what is wrong with Tiguans, Touaregs   Smart_Company Africa’s move on palm oil to hurt local industries   LATEST FROM NAIROBI NEWS LATEST NTV VIDEOS Surgery by a quack: Patients narrate ordeal at hands of quack doctor Raila defends Kingi: CORD leader says Kilifi governor is fighting graft IEBC tender appeal: Hearing in appeal against ballot papers tender starts Mihango land row: President Kenyatta orders KDF to vacate disputed land Armed men attack Booker Police Post in Mumias Watch More Videos Contact Us FAQ E-papers About Us Business Daily Daily Monitor Nairobi News NTV The Citizen The EastAfrican

Sarah WuAug 19, 2016 3:10PM EDT Facebook Twitter Pinterest Facebook Twitter Pinterest facebook dialog PinterestCourtesy of Instagram/@lauriehernandez_ Laurie Hernandez – youngest member of the U.S. women’s gymnastics routine and gold medalist, has yet another thing to smile about now. More specifically, her expressive smile (which apparently gave rise to the nickname the “human emoji”) is coming to a Crest ad near you. Laurie is now the face of Crest and Orgullosa, which is P&G’s online, Latina community, NewBeauty reports. “When you’re given the opportunity of a lifetime to perform on the world’s biggest stage, smiling with confidence for your family and supporters is part of every routine,” says Laurie in the brand’s release. We’ve seen her megawatt beam all over her Instagram, so it comes as no surprise to us that her pearly whites are now taking the stage, too. We can’t wait to see her upcoming campaign, and we have a feeling she’ll be smiling wider than ever. In the meantime, we’ll await her tips for getting teeth that shine brighter than her medals – because while we won’t be owning the latter, we can certainly try for the former.

As NASA prepares to stop funding the International Space Station in about a decade, the agency is inviting companies to use the science lab to test their wildest space-business ideas while they still can. By Lonnie Shekhtman, Staff August 19, 2016 Save for later Saved The International Space Station. NASA/AP View Caption About video ads View Caption of As NASA prepares to stop funding the International Space Station (ISS) in about a decade, the agency is appealing to companies to use the science lab to test their wildest space-business ideas while they still can. Eventually, NASA hopes that low Earth orbit will become a hub of commercial activity, with enterprises operating in space independently of the ISS. “NASA is interested in what exciting, new ideas people have for using the ISS that could lead to space being just another place to go to work or school,” NASA said in a request for information in July. In response, 11 submissions “from a broad range of respondents including individuals, small companies and large companies,” came in, said Sam Scimemi, division director for the ISS program, in an e-mail to Bloomberg. Recommended: Could you survive the Star Wars universe? Take our quiz! While the nature of the ideas has not been made public, some of the research already taking place aboard the ISS might offer some clues. Merck, Novartis, and Procter & Gamble are among the companies that have taken advantage of the microgravity environment of the space station to do drug research. Another company has tested the effects of low gravity on alloys, or metals that are used extensively on Earth in car parts, golf clubs, electronics, and medical devices. Test your knowledge Could you survive the Star Wars universe? Take our quiz! Photos of the Day Photos of the day 11/23 Just a few of weeks ago, a research lab developed by Texas-based private company NanoRacks was attached to the space station with two experiments on board. One, sent up by a company called Yosemite Space, is testing how computer chips can be used in future space missions to power autonomous vehicles and data processing. "What I really hope is what we’re doing with these early commercial researchers, there will one day be way more than the ISS can handle,” Michael Read, who manages National Lab, an economic development program of the ISS, told The Christian Science Monitor in January. The ISS is well-suited to research in areas like health to materials sciences, and as a testbed for technologies that could be used for missions deeper into space. But there could be other possibilities that NASA hasn’t even considered, the agency says. “Some companies are asking to use the ISS as a stepping stone for other, more ‘out-of-the box’ concepts, such as future space stations that are commercially owned and operated,” NASA says on its blog. “Whether a commercial space station is a hotel, a research facility, a university, or a combination of all of these ideas is open for discussion.” A space hotel is not out of the realm of possibility. Tourists delivered to space by Blue Origin, a space tourism company owned by Amazon chief Jeff Bezos, might one day need somewhere to stay. The company has said that it could start shooting paying passengers into space as early as 2018.  NASA, in the meantime, is scheduled to leave the space station by 2028. As the primary funder, the agency is spending $3 billion annually to run the 16-year-old science laboratory orbiting Earth 240 miles up in the air. That expense is expected to rise to $4 billion by 2020, according to ArsTechnica. NASA is promising a crewed mission to Mars in the 2030s, and it cannot afford to support both the space station and a deep-space mission, William Gerstenmaier, the agency’s chief of human spaceflight, said last year. “We’re going to get out of ISS as quickly as we can,” Mr. Gerstenmaier said at a December meeting, as ArsTechnica reported. “Whether it gets filled in by the private sector or not, NASA’s vision is we’re trying to move out.” Next up Test your knowledge Could you survive the Star Wars universe?

In continental Europe, markets ended sharply higher, driven by gains in basic resource stocks. Furthermore, positive corporate earnings released fuelled buying. Germany’s DAX and France’s CAC 40 advanced 0.6% and 0.4%, respectively. Wall Street Wall Street ended in the green, as oil prices rallied amid speculations that major oil producers would freeze production. Additionally, positive economic data and upbeat earnings released boosted investor confidence. The S&P 500 increased 0.2%, with the energy sector losing the most. Asia Equities are trading mixed, as some Fed officials reiterated the possibility of hiking interest rates in the coming months. The Nikkei 225 gained 0.4%, while the Hang Seng was trading 0.3% down at 7:00 am. Oil Yesterday, WTI prices increased 3.1% to US$48.22 per barrel, while Brent oil prices rose 2.1% to US$50.89 per barrel. Headlines Retail sales in UK jump in July As per the Office for National Statistics, the UK’s retail sales grew 5.9% y-o-y in July, above economists’ forecast of a 4.2% rise, after gaining 4.3% in June. Sales, excluding auto fuel, surged 5.4% y-o-y in July compared with the 3.9% growth in June. The increase in sales was primarily led by warmer weather conditions and a weaker pound. Company news Concepta (LON:CPT, 11.88p)– Speculative Buy Concepta's AIM Admission followed a reverse takeover from Frontier Resources International plc and renaming back on 25th July. Injected into the corporate shell was a pioneering UK healthcare company and developer of a proprietary platform and suite of products targeted at the personalised mobile health market with a primary focus on women's fertility and specifically unexplained infertility. Yesterday, the Company announces its unaudited results for the six months ended 30 June 2016. Operational highlights for the period included the disposal or dissolution of all oil and gas related subsidiaries of the legacy business, while the new management undertook a strategic review while completing the acquisition of Concepta plc for £3.026 million comprising 30,343,950 New Ordinary Shares and £0.75 million in cash. Its MyLotus brand is a unique offering that allows quantitative and qualitative measurement of a woman's personal hCG and LH hormone levels in urine samples. It has defined its route to market as, (i) Regulatory approvals for launch in China in place - first order from distributor with payment in advance expected following hospital testing in Q3 2016 and, (ii) CE-Marking for UK and Europe to follow in 2017. The Company’s cash balance at the period end was US$1.335m (H1 2015: US$0.02m), while incurring losses of US$0.336m from continuing operations (H1 2015: US$0.504m). Our view: Concepta has fills an important need for a significant number of apparently fertile women who, for apparently unexplained reasons, consistently fail to conceive. The pregnancy and ovulation testing markets are well established and global, with significantly the largest brand being Clearblue, the flagship of Swiss Precision Diagnostics GmbH, a 50:50 JV with Procter & Gamble. But such products are incapable of measuring the personal hCG and LH hormone levels necessary to optimise fertility cycle timing and thereby provide a genuine alternative to the IVF clinic. The global revenue opportunity for Concepta runs into billions of dollars and its initial target markets in China and Europe are estimated to have potential in the region of £600m alone. Concepta’s proprietary home-testing/point-of-care equipment also lends itself to wider family home-health monitoring to improve individual health parameters including chronic stress, inflammation, urinary tract, healthy pregnancy progression etc. Indeed, Concepta find itself in a unique position to come in at the ground floor of the fast growing global connected healthcare sector, which is set to be worth US$61bn by 2020. Beaufort places a Speculative Buy recommendation on the shares. Beaufort Securities acts as corporate broker to Concepta Kingfisher (LON:KGF, 364.70p)– Hold Kingfisher provided a trading update for Q2 FY 2016 ending 31st July 2016. During the period, sales advanced 8.4% y-o-y to £3.0bn in reported basis, or 3.2% at constant currency basis, while like-for-like (LFL) sales expanded 3.0% at constant currency basis, compared with Q2 FY 2015. In the UK and Ireland, sales rose 5.1% to £1.4bn in reported basis, with an LFL sales growth of 7.2%. Sales from France rose 10.4% to £1.1bn in reported basis, while LFL sales declined 3.2%. Sales from Other International grew 12.8% to £539m on a reported basis, with LFL sales increasing 7.0%. On the operational front, Kingfisher completed disposal of the remaining 30% economic interest in B&Q China following the regulatory approval and received net cash proceeds of £63m. The company has returned £150m (44 million shares) to date to shareholders since year end through share buyback. Our view: Kingfisher delivered excellent performance in Q2 FY 2016. The company recorded an increase in sales on both reported and LFL fronts. Kingfisher’s growth was led by a rise in sales of tools to tradesmen in the UK and a surge in sales in its Polish division. Wet weather conditions and extensive industrial activities led to fall in sales in the company’s French business. The Group’s ONE Kingfisher plan announced in March 2015 to create a unified, unique and leading home improvement offer while driving digital capability and optimising operational efficiency is making good progress and remains ahead of schedule. The company continued to enhance shareholder value through its share buyback programme. However, Brexit has created uncertainty in the market and dampened investor confidence. We would like to wait and assess Kingfisher’s performance in the near future, and thus maintain a Hold rating. National Grid (LON:NG., 1,081.50p) - Buy National Grid provided an update on Mid-Period Review (MPR) for the RIIO-T1 price control, conducted by UK energy regulator Ofgem. The areas covered under MPR are related to specific outputs, with eight-year allowances in Gas Transmission and Electricity Transmission. Following the review, Ofgem proposed that allowances adjusted to reflect that some outputs are no longer required, which would result in a reduction of £169m in Gas Transmission and £38m in Electricity Transmission. Ofgem also proposed to approve £21m of the request related to the enhancement of system operator outputs. These changes are expected to be implemented April 2018 onwards. Our view: The aforementioned update highlights Ofgem’s proposal to scrap some of the power and gas projects undertaken by National Grid. The scope of MPR is narrow, with no changes to financial parameters of the framework. National Grid delivered excellent performance in FY 2016 on both financial and operational fronts. The company benefitted from the electricity price difference in Britain and continental Europe, which lifted the trading volumes on its network. National Grid recorded robust growth in the UK and generated savings of over £330m for customers in the first three years of regulated price control (RIIO). The company made substantial progress with rate filings in New York and Massachusetts. Value-added metric, which reflects the key component of value delivery to shareholders, was strong with value added in the year totalling £1.8bn or 47.6p per share. National Grid is selling majority stake in its UK gas distribution business. After the sale, the company expects to deliver higher growth and maintain a strong balance sheet to fund its investment programme. In light of the above argument, we maintain a Buy rating on the stock. Physiomics (LON:PYC, 0.03p) - Speculative Buy Following the announcement on 31st March 2016 of its intention to acquire BioMoti Limited, Physiomics yesterday announced it has signed a Share Purchase Agreement with BioMoti. The acquisition remains conditional on the Company completing a successful placing to raise a minimum of £1m to develop the new joint Group's drug discovery and development pipeline. BioMoti's platform technology, Oncojan creates nanoparticles which package cancer drugs into sustained release delivery vehicles which are then coated with tumour targeting protein called CD95R (http://www.biomoti.com/technology/). BioMoti's lead asset, MOTI1001, contains the drug paclitaxel which has been approved for many years and is widely used to treat various types of cancer, therefore mitigating the risk of development. In pre-clinical mouse models of ovarian cancer MOTI1001 has shown significantly greater ability to shrink tumours than paclitaxel alone and also appears to be significantly more tolerable. The Consideration for the acquisition will comprise, (i) 50% of the entire issued share capital of the Company immediately prior to Completion (but for clarity prior to the issue of any ordinary shares in connection with the Placing) and: (ii) £50k in cash (subject to certain completion accounting adjustments to reflect the actual levels of cash and liabilities in the Company at completion). For the period ended 30 November 2015, BioMoti Limited had a turnover of £2,062 made a loss for the financial year of £9,700 and its gross assets were valued at £2,331. Completion is expected to occur on or before 31 October 2016. Our view: If the BioMoti deal completes, Physiomics risk profile and prospective funding needs will change quite significantly. But that said, there is significant potential value in developing an oncology pipeline alongside existing and new opportunities in base modelling and simulation. And the existing pharmaceutical base development and simulation business continues to record important progress. Since March 2015, for example, it has confirmed the first contract for a clinical version of its Virtual Tumour model with global pharmaceutical company, Merck Serono, a (4th) large pharma customer for its Virtual Tumour (pre-clinical) model and a new speciality pharma customer for PK/ PD modelling of a new drug combination in the pain space and a subsequent extension of this contract, along with the 5th, 6th and 7th extensions to a Virtual Tumour project with a major global pharmaceutical company with which has now been a client for over 4 years. Credibility and momentum of Virtual Tumour Clinical, however, will take time to build into the high-margin repeat business envisaged by the Company’s original business plan so the new management now headed by CEO, Dr Jim Millen, is seeking to bolt on a new complementary arm that can create value by both exploiting its existing skills/development tools as well as generating additional newsflow. This will be created through Virtual Tumour being utilised to increase value of internal drug candidates via optimised regimens while targeting CD95L might also provide a way to personalise cancer treatment to appropriate patients. Additionally, Physiomics could employ its modelling techniques to predict the patients who would benefit most from drug candidates, and the Oncojan™ platform could be used in conjunction with Virtual Tumour to develop further targeted therapies for different cancer indications and drug combinations. So Physiomics is most certainly set to become a rather more exciting prospect. It needs to be recognised, however, that the proposed raise in this funding round will likely only suffice for a quite limited period and that the enlarged Group can be expected to seek additional support from shareholder as its projects progress. Beaufort places a Speculative Buy recommendation on the shares. Premier Oil (LON:PMO, 76.50p) - Speculative Buy In its Interims, Premier has raised its production guidance for FY2016 to 68-73k boepd and reported that it will be free cash-flow positive in H2 with oil prices above US$45 per barrel. Recent production has exceeded 95k boepd, helped by the 14k boepd from the first producer well on the Solan field. The second and final producer well on the Solan field is expected to be tied in shortly and to reach production of 20-25k boepd. The Catcher development project (Premier: 50% operating interest) remains on track for first oil in H2 2017. The subsea installation campaign is ahead of plan, while all six development wells drilled to date have met or exceeded predictions for reservoir quality while flow rates have been at or above prognosis. Negotiations on refinancing are reported as making good progress. The negotiations centre on amending covenants and extending debt maturities. The company anticipates negotiations to conclude and new agreements in place during H2 2016. Our view: The debt restructuring was anticipated to take time but the Company have indicated that ‘Good progress is being made with the company's lending group over amendments to the medium term covenant profile and resetting of debt maturities’. With continuing production growth (Solan, EON assets acquisition) and Catcher on target for product 2017, we maintain our Speculative Buy stance on the Company. Tullow Oil (LON:TLW, 239.60p) - Speculative Buy Tullow Oil has announced that first oil has flowed from the Tweneboa, Enyenra, Ntomme (TEN) fields offshore Ghana. First oil has been reached on time and on budget three years after the Plan of Development was approved in May 2013. The TEN start-up process is now well advanced and Tullow expects oil production to ramp-up gradually towards the FPSO capacity of 80,000 bopd through the remainder of 2016. Tullow estimates that TEN average annualised production in 2016 will be approximately 23,000 bopd gross (net: 11,000 bopd). Tullow is the operator of the TEN fields and holds a 47.175% stake. Tullow's joint venture partners are Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (17%), Kosmos Energy (17%), Ghana National Petroleum Corporation (15%) and PetroSA (3.875%). Our view: This is an important moment for Tullow as production begins from the TEN fields. It is also pleasing to report the delivering of this project on time and on budget. This brings to a close a period of heavy investment for Tullow, and we look forward to seeing debt (US$4.7bn) reduction. It is important that production at least meets guidance for real impact on the debt reduction. Tullow Oil is one of Beaufort Securities Tips for the Year, and whilst we retain a Speculative Buy on the Company, short-term investors may wish to lock in some profits.

STAFF PHOTO/ROBERT BAKER ROBERT BAKER / STAFF PHOTO Procter & Gamble President and CEO David Taylor addresses a crowd marking the P&G Mehoopany plant’s 50th anniversary Thursday afternoon. Mr. Taylor was plant manager there from 1989 to 1991. WASHINGTON TWP. — The Procter & Gamble plant in Wyoming County pulled out all the stops for its 50th birthday celebration Thursday with a pep talk from the parent company’s president and chief executive officer. David Taylor was introduced as having been “made in Mehoopany” as he was plant manager there from 1989 to 1991. Mr. Taylor said he knew early on “that if you had the passion to do what is right for people, excellence will prevail.” He said that three things really stood out while he was in Washington Twp.: A mastery of technical and operating details, “a high standard where good is not good enough as you want to be better than your best global competitor,” and an excellence that all starts with delighting the customer, “and we’ve done that.” He was in Silicon Valley last week and will be in China, Philippines and Singapore next week, but wanted to be in Wyoming County this week because of the significant milestone of marking a half century “where excellence really is timeless.” Mr. Taylor said it was a tremendous honor to be head of P&G worldwide, as he has been since November 2015. He said he learned in Wyoming County “it’s not what you personally do, it’s what you and those around you can make happen.” “I’m standing on the shoulder of so many people who built this facility into what it is, and I’m proud of all of you,” he said, but noted “the best is ahead of us, and the group here now is ready to write the next chapter of successes.” The local plant employs around 2,000 people, the largest of P&G’s 138 manufacturing facilities around the world. Fifty percent of Procter & Gamble’s family care products (Charmin tissue, and Bounty paper towels and napkins) are made in Wyoming County. Thirty percent of its baby care products (Pampers and Luvs diapers) are made here, too. Pampers is a $10 billion-a-year brand for P&G and well over a billion dollars of that comes out of Wyoming County. The first product line of Pampers was successfully made in October 1966 by a workforce then forecast to grow to just 350.

Olympic gold medal-winning swimmer Ryan Lochte’s apparent tall story about getting robbed in Rio has ruined his chances of picking up any new sponsors, sports business experts told The Post on Thursday. “Right now, sponsors will be trying to figure the real story and from there they’ll take action, but it’s difficult to navigate right now,” said sports branding expert Jarrod Moses, of United Entertainment Group. Henry Shafer, who runs Q Scores, an awareness and likability index for marketers, said Lochte’s scores are already sinking. The 32-year-old swimmer, with 12 Olympic medals, including a gold medal in the 4×200-meter relay in Rio, had “shown signs of being a polarizing personality” even before the Rio Games started, Shafer said. Lochte’s likely tall tale about being robbed by thieves posing as Rio cops has nearly overshadowed the Games themselves. As is typical in the first days after an athlete gets into trouble, marketing partners have little to say. Lochte has a long list of sponsors, including Ralph Lauren, Gatorade, Nissan, Mutual of Omaha, Speedo and Procter & Gamble, and they are likely to wait for more facts to be known before making a decision on whether to continue their relationship with the swimmer, experts said. On Thursday morning, NBC “Today” show anchor Matt Lauer said he spoke to Lochte the day before and that the athlete had told him: “We wouldn’t make this story up.” SEE ALSO Ryan Lochte is everything the world hates about Americans :0 This was late one night — actually, early one morning... Ryan Lochte is everything the world hates about Americans Only Ralph Lauren, a USOC partner, gave a statement, telling The Post it is “reviewing the situation.” That followed a press conference held by Brazilian authorities who accused Lochte and one of the three other swimmers of making up the story. Lochte, worth about $3 million, is signed to Hollywood talent shop CAA and his agent was not available to comment. Media measurement firm iSpot reports Lochte appeared in TV ads 117 times during the Games so far. “As time moves on, a lot will depend on what he says and how quickly,” Shafer said. “The longer the delay, the more negative perception and it’s harder to overcome.” In a January poll, Q Scores found Lochte was known by around 26 percent of the US population, and of those people, 10 percent said he was one of their favorite personalities. At the same time, rival Michael Phelps had a 67 percent awareness and a 12 percent Q Score. “We’ll see what happens with Lochte, it’s going to create a lot of controversy,” added Shafer, who is set to conduct a new poll on the athletes after the Games end. A separate marketing survey by Canvs, which tracks language on Twitter, shows Lochte displaying many more negative emotional reactions — such as “crazy,” “dislike,” “idiot,” “weird” and “hate,” it said. The number of tweets using the word “love” dropped from 30 percent to 20 percent.

Olympic champion addresses the rumours Creative gymnast secured four gold medals at the Rio 2016 Olympics. By Toyin Owoseje August 20, 2016 17:52 BST Simone Biles first revealed her crush on Zac Efron at the Ellen DeGeneres ShowGetty Olympic champion gymnast Simone Biles has addressed reports that she is set to compete in the upcoming season of Dancing With The Stars. The 19-year-old American athlete, who won four gold medals at the Rio 2016 Olympics, said that despite her desire to participate in the TV competition, her busy schedule would not allow it. US Weekly previously reported that ABC producers were eyeing up the talented teenager for season 23 of DWTS. "They would love to cast some Olympians if possible," a source told the magazine. However, the news should be taken with a pinch of salt as the network has not officially confirmed anything. "I would love to do Dancing with the Stars, but so far we have a three-month tour after this Olympics," she told E! News' Zuri Hall at the P&G Family Home in Rio. "I'm not sure if I'll have time." But hope is not completely lost. The artistic gymnast said that she should the opportunity present itself for the season 23 cycle she would not turn it down. "I would really love to do it in the spring if that's possible." Should her reality TV debut happen, Biles would follow in the footsteps of fellow Olympians Shawn Johnson, Nastia Liukin and Aly Raisman. Dancing With the Stars returns to screens on Monday, 12 September, at 8pm EST on ABC. The network has yet to announce this year's line-up. Meanwhile, Biles has continued her winning streak since emerging victorious at Rio. She struck gold once again when she spent some memorable moments with her celebrity crush Zac Efron. As they posed for photos the Baywatch star surprised her with a quick peck on her cheek. "Just call me Mrs Efron already @ZacEfron," an ecstatic Biles tweeted along with the photo of Efron kissing her. ðð¹ just call me mrs.efron already @ZacEfron pic.twitter.com/FF4NTgj4MP— Simone Biles (@Simone_Biles) August 16, 2016 More from IBTimes UK Brilliant Usain Bolt and Simone Biles help ease pain as Rio experience draws to a close What happened when Rio Olympics star Simone Biles met her crush Zac Efron?

Safe, clean water in the marshland | Sun.Star Skip to main content Archive Webcast E-paper Videos Multimedia Home Local News Business Opinion Sports Feature Lifestyle Entertainment SuperBalita Home / Davao / Weekend / Safe, clean water in the marshland Safe, clean water in the marshland Time to read 2 minutes Share Print a- a+ Read so far Safe, clean water in the marshland Saturday, August 20, 2016 CRISTELIE'S family seems content with their life in the marshland. They start the day at 4 in the morning. She and her husband, Jomer, would talk for a while over coffee before the former would head out to fish. At 6, she starts preparing her children, Jomarie and Kristin for school. "We live a very simple life," she shares. As soon as the clock hits 7, she starts paddling her canoe, a small boat with no built-in outriggers, to bring her children to school. She tags along 1-year old Daniel, her youngest. "Our lives revolve around the lake - our homes, our source of income and even our drinking water." Life in Agusan Marsh Cristelie's is one of the more than 40 Manobo tribal families in Sitio Panlabuhan, a floating village situated at the heart of Kanimbaylan Lake. Just a speck of the whole marshland, Agusan Marsh covers 15 percent of the country's freshwater resources. Home to more than 250 bird species, it is a wildlife sanctuary and was declared a protected area. Sitio Panlabuhan also boasts of its houses, including the two churches, primary school and community centre, that are built on piles of bamboos which adjust to the rise and fall of the water. Taking off from Bunawan, Agusandel Sur, it takes about 2 to 3 hours of boat ride to reach the village. While the place is in itself a paradise, the Manobos are confronted with the problem on safe drinking water. "We rely on rain for drinking water. If there is none, we go to a nearby spring that is also connected to the lake. If we are really left with no choice, especially during floods, we drink from the lake," village chairman Julie Bello shares. It's in the same source that they do their washing, bathing and other activities. Cristelie started worrying when her children started having stomach problems. As much as she and her husband want to bring them to the hospital, they can't because of how secluded their place is. Besides, going out of the swamp is expensive and no easy feat. Most of the families rely on herbal medicine. "We knew it was because of the water they drink but we didn't have any choice," she said. According to World Health Organization, contaminated water may cause water-borne diseases, the most deadly of which are diarrhoeal infections. It causes about 1.5 million child deaths each year, mostly among children below five. The clean water project In partnership with Procter and Gamble and in coordination with the local government, World Vision introduced PUR packets in Sitio Panlabuhan last October 2015. A water purification technology, PUR powder is able to remove bacteria that causes waterborne diseases. Each sachet can treat up to 20 liters of water. "It is also easy to use," shares World Vision staff Franklyn Salindato. The sachet is poured into unclean water and then stirred until the bacteria form into small particles that will settle at the bottom of the pail. The PUR-treated water will then be strained through a white cloth. "I was uneasy at first but seeing how a peat-coloured water turned crystal clear, it must have been the answer to my prayers. As a mother, it gives me peace of mind knowing that my children are drinking safe water," says Cristelie. Today, she also bathes her children, especially one-year-old Daniel with PUR-treated water. Her children's school was also provided with PUR packets. "This has helped reduce cases of diarrhea in our village. It also raised awareness amongst us regarding the importance of clean water," Bello said, adding that because most of the people in the village grew up drinking water from the lake, they feel that it's no problem at all. "There has been a lot of changes. The spring where we used to get water when we were little is no longer as clean as it used to be," he said. World Vision’s clean drinking water project, now on its second phase, has already benefited more than 9,000 families.

Seals Huge Advertising Deal With Omnicom Group Inc. The telco giant just dumped WPP and consolidated its creative, digital, and media ad accounts under Omnicom. Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Aug 20, 2016 at 11:00AM AT&T (NYSE:T) recently centralized its creative, digital, and media accounts under a single account with advertising and PR giant Omnicom (NYSE:OMC). The decision represents a major victory for Omnicom and a big loss for its rival, WPP (NASDAQ:WPPGY). Omnicom's BBDO previously handled creative accounts for the AT&T brand, while WPP's Grey and MEC respectively handled the DirecTV and media accounts. But with advertising now becoming a more significant part of AT&T's business, the telco invited both companies to make a pitch for the integrated creative and media business. After two months of review, AT&T moved the DirecTV account to BBDO and the media account to Omnicom's new media agency, Hearts & Science. Let's take a look at how this deal could help both AT&T and Omnicom. Image source: AT&T. What the deal means for AT&T Lori Lee, senior VP and global marketing officer at AT&T, said in a prepared statement reported by FireceWireless that a "single integrated team allows us to move quickly, innovate at scale and take a data-driven, holistic approach to reaching consumers and businesses." Lee noted that those capabilities would be important as it launches "new streaming video entertainment choices that are built for mobile." Streamlining those operations would complement the integration of AT&T's wireless service and DirecTV. AT&T currently offers unlimited wireless plans for DirecTV customers, and "data free" websites and videos to counter similar services like T-Mobile's Binge On and Verizon's Go90. AT&T will also launch three streaming video services later this year -- DirecTV Now, an app for content from its satellite TV business; DirecTV Mobile, an app for premium video content; and DirecTV Preview, an ad-supported service with free videos from a wide variety of sources. AT&T will reportedly rely less on broadcast TV ads and more on digital ads, which isn't surprising since many cord-cutters are pivoting toward OTT [over-the-top] and mobile platforms. Centralizing ad operations for the wireless, mobile, pay TV, and media accounts under Omnicom would enable AT&T to gather analytics from a single system and make focused marketing pushes to strengthen its core wireless and pay TV businesses. What the deal means for Omnicom AT&T spends more on advertising than any other telco in the U.S., and its total U.S. ad spending is only topped by consumer staples giant Procter & Gamble. Ad Age reports that AT&T spent $3.3 billion on ads in 2014, which represented nearly 3% of its operating expenses. Ad Age hasn't released AT&T's estimated ad spend for 2015 yet, but it's likely much higher following the acquisition of DirecTV last July. Omnicom won't handle all of AT&T's advertising business -- multicultural creative will be handled by multiple agencies, and Cricket's creative work will still be handled by Argonaut. However, Cricket's media buying, which was previously handled by MEC, will be moved to Hearts & Science. But Omnicom will oversee enough of the business that we can safely assume that it will handle a few billion dollars of AT&T's ad buys within the next year. This victory could get Omnicom's revenue growth -- which missed estimates over the past three quarters -- back on track. Sales rose just 1.8% annually to $3.88 billion last quarter, missing estimates by $30 million. Advertising revenue, which accounted for 53% of its top line, rose 7.7% annually and outperformed its smaller CRM, PR, and specialty businesses. Prior to the AT&T announcement, analysts expected Omnicom's revenue and earnings to respectively rise just 2% and 8% for the full year. Those estimates could now be too conservative as AT&T ramps up its ad spend in the second half of the year. It could also convince other major customers with fragmented ad accounts to centralize those operations with Omnicom -- which would be bad news for rivals like WPP. The key takeaways AT&T's decision to consolidate its ad accounts with Omnicom is a win-win deal for both companies. AT&T streamlines its ad campaigns for new DirecTV branded initiatives, and Omnicom's revenue and reputation get a nice boost. The clear loser here is WPP, but the massive group -- which serves ads for all 30 Dow companies, 77 of the NASDAQ 100, and 352 for the Fortune Global 500 -- should shrug off that loss fairly easily.

By Katy O'Donnell 08/20/16 07:42 AM EDT The 12th and final annual meeting of the Clinton Global Initiative will showcase both its philanthropic work and Hillary Clinton’s greatest potential vulnerability. | Getty Facebook Twitter Google + Email Comment Print Hundreds of corporate executives, foreign dignitaries and celebrities will pile into a Manhattan ballroom to hobnob with Bill and Chelsea Clinton next month at their charity’s keynote annual event — just days before Hillary Clinton defends herself against pay-to-play accusations from Donald Trump in their first debate. The 12th and final annual meeting of the Clinton Global Initiative will showcase its philanthropic work and also the Democratic nominee’s greatest potential vulnerability — her ties to a sprawling global charity that has accepted donations from Middle Eastern governments, foreign businessmen with checkered histories and major corporations with business before the government. Story Continued Below Some Democratic operatives say they’re dismayed by the timing of the three-day conference Sept. 19-21 — a week before the first national debate and seven weeks before Election Day. They say it’s inevitable that having two members of the former and perhaps future first family rubbing shoulders with the well-heeled and well-connected will provide fresh ammunition to the Republican campaign, even as Hillary Clinton is off honing rebuttals to charges that donors got special consideration from the government while she was Secretary of State. "Some might suggest that the Clinton Global Initiative is simply a glitzy week of highlighting troubling donors," said Democratic strategist Hank Sheinkopf. "Others will see it as an annual event highlighting distinctive international issues. In the debate, Trump will see it as ammunition to batter the Democrat." "The timing is obviously not good," said one Clinton veteran, adding that it was probably unavoidable. “These events get planned months and months and months in advance and canceling it on short notice is not possible." Clinton Foundation to stop accepting foreign and corporate donations if Hillary wins By Nolan D. McCaskill Trump is likely to intensify his critiques of the foundation after the resignation Friday of his former campaign chair, Paul Manafort, whose murky financial ties to Russia and pro-Russian Ukrainian officials undercut the force of Trump’s argument on the Clintons’ relationships with foreign donors and governments. While GOP nominee Mitt Romney addressed the conference four years ago, this year, Republicans are using charges of cronyism and favorable access for Clinton Foundation donors as a key line of attack against the Democratic nominee. Bill Clinton’s announcement Thursday that he and his daughter, Chelsea, would stop raising money for the foundation and turn over operations to independent parties if Hillary Clinton wins the presidency will likely be overshadowed by media attention on this year’s confab. The foundation has not disclosed this year’s sponsors, and it’s unclear whether the announcement Thursday will serve as a last call — bringing in a flood of cash before the spigot is turned off, or underscore how fraught donations might appear in the middle of a presidential campaign, and give potential contributors a reason to pass. As of Friday, three heads of state — Argentinian President Mauricio Macri, Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi and Serbian Prime Minister Aleksandar Vucic — were listed as speakers. The price of admission is steep: For a $20,000 annual membership fee, corporations and nonprofits can secure an invitation for their top executive to mingle with the likes of Angelina Jolie, Bill Gates and Queen Rania of Jordan, while brainstorming projects to address problems ranging from poverty and climate change to elephant poaching. Boston Globe calls for freeze on Clinton Foundation donations By Tyler Pager The CGI event, which is timed to coincide with the United Nations General Assembly, has traditionally been a more glamorous version of the proceedings a few blocks away, drawing Nobel laureates, Hollywood celebrities, leading CEOs and heads of state. The meetings have “convened more than 190 sitting and former heads of state” since they started in 2005, according to the foundation’s website. "To wind down something that is that substantive and that impactful is not easily done,” said Clinton campaign and foundation donor Jay Jacobs. “… Whatever hits, unfair as they may be, may come the way of President Clinton or the candidate Hillary, or the foundation, there are some things that just transcend politics." The conference has also been linked to less glittery names; it was at the 2009 meeting that the “Clinton Global Citizen” award for “excellence in public service” went to Rwandan President Paul Kagame, whose economic success in the country has been matched by human rights abuses and accusations of violence against his opponents. The political spotlight on this year’s meeting may be off-putting to some of the meeting’s usual sponsors. Barclays will not sponsor the event again this year, according to people familiar with the bank’s plans. Several other past sponsors have not finalized their commitments and at least one is leaning against participating this year. A handful of the 33 listed sponsors of last year’s conference confirmed to POLITICO that they are signing on again as sponsors, including Procter & Gamble, Microsoft, the Ford Foundation and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. State Department: Clinton Foundation didn't influence us By Josh Gerstein Current and former sponsors include corporations in heavily regulated industries that stand to benefit from favorable government relations, from banking to pharmaceuticals to energy. Twenty-nine of the 30 Dow Jones Industrial Average index companies have been linked to the Clintons’ sprawling charities, Bloomberg reported in 2014. Twenty-five contributed to the foundation, and 27 committed to charitable projects through the Clinton Global Initiative, according to the report. UnitedHealth Group Inc. was the single holdout. Even a year ago, the swirl of negative headlines — detailing the overlap between contributors to the charity and the Clinton presidential campaign, lapses in donor disclosure and cases where foundation donors received favorable government actions — was already putting off wary donors and invitees, five months after Clinton had announced her candidacy. She stayed away from last year’s proceedings as she is doing this year. Several high-profile invitees, from Mark Zuckerberg to Pope Francis, declined to attend, POLITICO reported at the time. Obama and prominent members of his administration who’d spoken in the past also steered clear of the event. Meanwhile, Dow, ExxonMobil, PwC, Samsung, and foreign banks HSBC and Deutsche Bank declined to renew their sponsorships. Still, a few new corporations joined last year, including Gap Inc. and the Middle Eastern construction giant Consolidated Contractors Company. Annie Karni contributed to this report.

Which CPG brands are winning on Amazon? 18 Jul 16 | Author Graham Charlton | Ecommerce Stats Tweet The best sellers on Amazon aren’t always the brands you would expect. While the market-leading brands are becoming more effective on the site, it’s often new and emerging brands that sell on Amazon that are now benefiting from early-mover advantage. Amazon is so big that it cannot now be ignored as a marketplace for brands. Its sales are growing one to two times faster than ecommerce overall, while it drove 60% of total US online sales growth in 2015, capturing $100 billion in U.S. ecommerce sales. Stats from Profitero show the 100 best-selling products at Amazon in several key categories for the first six months of 2016, with a focus on CPG (consumer packaged goods). This is interesting, with Amazon’s recent focus on areas like online grocery shopping. Amazon Fresh is well established in the US, and has made moves in the UK recently. According to Alex McCord of Compass Marketing: “We’re now seeing the advent of ecommerce native companies: companies that come onto Amazon and other e-retailers and who are able to gain traction through getting a ton of recent reviews. They know how to work the Amazon algorithm and then launch products that, from the perspective of a brand in the brick-and-mortar world, have as low as zero market share. But in the world of unbranded search on Amazon and other retailers, they’re enormous players.” Profitero found that in Grocery and Beauty, the best-selling brand on Amazon is often not the brand that dominates that category offline. For example, healthy snack brand KIND tops the grocery best seller ranking at Amazon, while in Beauty, Pure Body Naturals is the winning brand with an average of 5,465 customer reviews. ArtNaturals takes the #3 spot with 5,512 reviews. The importance of unbranded search on Amazon Search at Amazon is the dominant pathway to product selection. According to a survey conducted by BloomReach last year, more shoppers go to Amazon before Google when they know what they’re looking for, and either want to find it or research it. New and emerging brands  are winning with Amazon because: Shoppers are searching for specific attributes (e.g. natural, gluten-free), and can find these products more easily on Amazon. Emerging brands are more aggressively optimizing their product content as they know this can gve them an advantage in Amazon searches. These brands are also often not widely distributed in brick-and-mortar stores, so shoppers have been trained to look for them at Amazon. The importance of consumer reviews Some of the most successful products have loads of reviews, and positive overall scores. For example, San Francisco Bay Coffee was the second best-selling grocery brand at Amazon between Jan-May 2016 with a staggering 23,696 reviews on average. This is further evidence of the importance of ‘social proof’. Melissa Menchaca of InstaNatural (a beauty brand that launched exclusively on Amazon in 2013) explains why reviews matter: “Because we’re so Amazon driven, social proof for us relates to reviews. More specifically product reviews from our customers. The reason why that is so important is because that is how we drive as a business. We’re very lean, we’re nimble, we’re fast-acting and this is what really sets us apart from other big name brands out there in the world. We’re able to gauge consumer interest about products and get that product to market faster than our P&G competitors.” In the battle of the beauty brands, who’s winning on Amazon? The study looked at the individual products that make up the top 100 best sellers for the Beauty category at Amazon. The analysis reveals that traditional beauty brands are well positioned. Procter & Gamble (P&G) was the leading beauty manufacturer at Amazon with seven best-selling brands appearing in the top 100 best sellers list (Oral B, Gillette, Crest, Braun, Gillette Venus, Oral-B Power and Olay), while Johnson & Johnson accounted for only four brands (Aveeno, Rogaine, Neutrogena and Nizoral). P&G products receive, on average, more than double the number of reviews that Johnson and Johnson products receive  (2,240 vs 1,132) further evidence that reviews do matter. With half of all predicted growth in CPG sales between now and 2018 expected to come from ecommerce, and with Amazon driving the majority of that growth, an Amazon strategy is essential for CPG brands.

The bottom line is that any advance in health IT or medical devices must be considered with one thing in mind, said Todd Dunn, director of innovation at Intermountain Healthcare in Salt Lake City, UT: The innovation is going to be used by healthcare providers on patients. “That’s the foundation,” he said. “You must start with empathy for the customer.” Dunn spoke this week leading one of the first sessions for the new class of startups at the Texas Medical Center’s TMCx accelerator, a group of 11 medical device companies from across the country. Over the course of three months, the startups will participate in seminars on topics including legal, financial, and IP issues; fundraising and financial planning; the hospital procurement process and sales and distribution. The program culminates in a demo day in November. Sure, Dunn told the group, technologists are infused with the belief that they are going to change the world. But he advised that the entrepreneurs should not to let that feeling bleed into arrogance. Instead, he stressed that they must constantly be curious, ask questions, and spend a lot of time being with the people who would be using the device. This approach is already common in some industries, from the movies to furniture to consumer goods like shampoo and laundry detergent. Pixar’s “Ratatouille” movie was successful, he said, because producers “did their homework,” watching chefs work in French kitchens—down to the angles of their elbows as they cooked—and wandering into a Paris sewer to see how the rats actually moved. Procter & Gamble [[(NYSE: PG)]] developed embedded-type systems in which employees lived in homes and worked with shopkeepers to better understand which products people want to use and sell. “If they’re doing this for soap, furniture, and toys, why isn’t it common for healthcare?” he asked. Dunn said being at the TMC can provide that same living lab for medical device startups. As they go about their visits to doctors, nurses, and other healthcare personnel, they should focus on discovering both points of frustration and hope, Dunn told the group. “What are the aspirational desires of doctors and look for workarounds,” Dunn said. “That’s where they are innovating.” Young medical device entrepreneurs need to figure out how their proposed innovations can perform customer jobs. “Nobody is a segment; they have jobs to do,” he said. These jobs can be broken down into functional, emotional, and social jobs, concepts for which he credits Harvard Business School professor and author Clayton Christensen. For example, a blood pressure monitor has a functional job: giving a reading. “The emotional job is making sure Mom and Dad are OK,” Dunn said. “The social job is ‘I’m being a good kid by using this for my parents.’ ” Angela Shah is the editor of Xconomy Texas.

The swimmer, who won a gold medal in the men’s 4x200m freestyle relay in Rio de Janeiro, has struggled to stay on top of a mugging story he told his mother that has since snowballed into an international incident. Officials in Brazil, eager to protect the nation’s reputation as a safe one for foreign travelers, are now contending that the mugging never happened, pointing to footage from a gas station and from security at the Olympic Village. And while Lochte made it back to the U.S. without incident, two of his teammates were detained in Rio for further questioning about the possibly false claims of a crime. NBC anchors Bob Costas and Matt Lauer discussed Lochte’s story with a gravity usually reserved for armed insurrections. Their tone was in stark contrast to everything else about the bleached-blond 32-year-old, an active tweeter and E! celeb who, in addition to a dozen Olympic medals, might best be known for the catchphrase “jeah” (which he tried, and failed, to trademark). Even the story of the mugging is farcical; the way he tells it, when a mugger pointed a gun at his forehead, Lochte’s response was, “Whatever.” Lauer and Costas were trying to bridge the gap between international incident, celebrity gossip, journalistic integrity, and the unabashed pro-American bias the network brings to its Olympics coverage. All things considered, they acquitted themselves pretty well; in some ways, because Lochte wasn’t present, it was easier for Lauer and Costas to frame the situation appropriately. (Lochte has proven to be skilled at digging himself ever-deeper.) Costas, in particular, is an anchor who has managed to retain integrity despite being embedded in a news organization that at times feels like circus music is playing in the background. Although it was, and still is, very funny that Lochte’s story appears to have been a terrible and mostly harmless fabrication, the seriousness with which NBC approached it was a reminder of how historically and culturally significant the Olympics are — and, arguably, should be, given how much money and time is devoted to its expression of global unity. And the blowup around Lochte, just a few days before Rio 2016’s Closing Ceremonies, has been a stark reminder of just how much the world has changed — and how NBC, as the arbiter of the American narrative of the Olympics, occasionally struggles to keep up. One of the reasons NBC always seems to be scrambling during the Olympics is because every winter and summer Games is a biennial trial-by-fire with completely different circumstances, whether that’s not enough snow in Sochi or a massive time difference to Sydney. Furthermore, the team of commentators, talking heads, and on-the-scene producers only get three weeks every two years to do what they do. It makes for a motley crew, sometimes; Rio 2016 was populated by a surprising number of winter sports athletes, including figure skaters Johnny Weir and Tara Lipinski, who introduced audiences to carnivale, and snowboarder Shaun White, who was there to… talk about his music, I guess? Add to that the network’s strangely prevalent cutaway to Ryan Seacrest, hanging out on Copacabana Beach for some reason, and the American presence in Rio felt like a hastily assembled theater troupe. So while I dinged the network last week for how it chose to broadcast the team gymnastics competition, I’ll allow that as Rio 2016 has progressed, NBC’s coverage has grown more confident. It specifically gained facility switching from live events to taped events to accommodate the slim one-hour time difference between Rio and the East Coast. Furthermore, as the hectic initial flush of excitement about the games wore off, the coverage settled into actually sticking with a sport for hours at a time, providing that lived-in experience with an obscure sport and far-flung countries’ athletes that is so essential to the Olympics. But despite that, gymnastics continued to present a problem for NBC — both practically and, dare I say it, semiotically. Gymnastics is a sport that Americans only tune into en masse once every four years, and furthermore, the stars are the women, not the men. It fits into a typically feminized pursuit of externally determined perfection, which was even more pronounced in the days when a gymnast could actually score a perfect 10. NBC’s chief marketing officer John Miller created a bit of a stir in advance of the Opening Ceremonies when he said that female viewers, who tend to watch the Olympics (and, I’ll add, are drawn to gymnastics), want to watch not a sporting event but a reality-TV miniseries. It’s not exactly news that a marketing executive might sound reductive and patronizing about a demographic, but Miller’s remarks belie just how significant female viewership is for Olympics ratings. It also gives lie to the type of narratives around female athletes that NBC might deem palatable for its audience. The network and its ad partners have been very invested in creating media narratives for the American women gymnasts that appeal to a domestic demographic — Proctor & Gamble, and in particular, Tide, focused on Simone Biles and Gabby Douglas and their relationships to their mothers for a recurring spot. (Indeed, given how difficult NBC made it to actually watch the gymnastics competitions in primetime, it was actually easier for children with a pre-11 p.m. bedtime to watch Biles in her Tide advertisement than it was to watch her win her four gold medals.) This pointedly housewifely framing is in sharp contrast to the history of gymnastics, which like hockey was a proxy for Cold War tensions. And this fuzzy sentiment has spilled over freely to the male commentators. During the balance beam final earlier this week for example, commentator Al Trautwig aww-ed over Dutch competitor Saane Wevers, who grabbed a pink notebook immediately after finishing the fantastic beam routine (which would eventually win her the gold). He said that he could only assume it was a diary to gush over her own performance. Color commentator Nastia Liukin, an Olympic gold medalist herself, corrected Trautwig — pointing out that Wevers, who is 24, was using the pink notebook not to pour out her girlish thoughts and feelings but instead to calculate her score. (Trautwig, to his credit, took it in stride.) And just Thursday night, NBC commentator and golfer David Feherty described Majlinda Kelmendi, the 25-year-old judoist that snagged the first ever gold for Kosovo, as “some daddy’s little girl.” (This was after he implied, charmingly, that he watched women’s beach volleyball primarily for the bikinis.) NBC wants to both showcase women athletes and attract female viewers, but it’s guilty of doing so through condescension. It’s puzzling, because while some Olympian women are still teenagers, most, especially American ones, are young disciplined women in their own right. Of course parents and partners are important, but it’s the women themselves that are not just essential to the Olympics but are in fact, the entire draw for viewers. Because the real story of this Olympics — and maybe of this era of Olympic Games — has been about the women. At New York Magazine, Ann Friedman wrote about how the Olympics has been proof positive of the Shine Theory — that notion that individual women succeed when all women succeed. That’s a notion that is, of course, antithetical to the entire concept of the Olympics, which is about competition and one-upmanship. And yet this Olympics has been flooded with women from many different countries who are, in stark contrast to the epic feud between Nancy Kerrigan and Tonya Harding, not just friendly but actively supporting each other. The most iconic image from this Olympics might be not any winner on a podium or a champion seizing victory but American runner Abbey D’Agostino helping up New Zealand runner Nikki Hamblin during a qualifying heat for the 5000m. And this narrative of feminine cooperation is especially significant given that it’s been an incredible Olympics for African-American women in particular, from Biles’ stack of medals and history-making swimmer Simone Manuel to the U.S. team sweeping all three medal spots for the 100m hurdles. In comparison to the buffoonery of Lochte — and the open sulking of Michael Phelps in warm-up — you have Katie Ledecky cheering on Manuel and Aly Raisman and Biles holding hands, hugging, and crying as results were called. It’s moments like this that make the Lochte story stand out in such amusing contrast; the seriousness and sportsmanship of the women, in comparison to what might be egregious idiocy, if not an outright crime, on the part of four male swimmers. As these Olympics close, the careful treatment of Lochte suggests that maybe NBC is finally understanding where the future of these games are. Not with the cavalier, empty-headed jocks, blond or otherwise, but with these heartfelt and disciplined women, who seem to inherently understand the context and importance of the Olympic Games. At the very least, based on the expressions on Matt Lauer and Bob Costas’ faces, we have a very clear idea of which Olympians can be taken seriously, and which ones are destined to be forgotten.

More importantly, it ignores Hope Solo, who continues to make a disgrace of herself and perpetuate the Ugly American stereotype. There have been Americans who have represented the country well and far fewer who have embarrassed us. But let’s not pretend determining which is which is as easy as looking at the athlete’s gender.

Comments? Criticisms? Ideas for future columns? Email me, or drop a note in the comments. More Economics If you were an American man working full-time in 1984, you earned, on average, a bit more than $22 an hour (adjusted for inflation to 2014 dollars). If you were particularly ambitious, or particularly in need of cash, you could make more money by working more hours, but on a per-hour basis, you’d still be making about the same — a bit more than $22 per hour. Fast-forward to 2015, though, and the picture looks a lot different. The average man working a typical full-time job, 35 to 49 hours a week, now earns about $26 an hour. But the man working 50 hours a week or more now earns close to $33 an hour.1 Hourly pay has risen more than twice as fast over the past three decades for men working long hours, as employers increasingly reward employees willing to work extra hours with raises or promotions. (The pattern crosses educational and industry lines, and holds when excluding overtime pay.) Notice that I said “men.” Men make up a bit more than half the full-time workforce, but they account for more than 70 percent of those working 50 hours a week or more. So as wage gains have gone disproportionately to people working long hours, they have also gone disproportionately to men, widening the earnings divide between men and women overall. The gender wage gap has narrowed significantly over the past 50 years. In 1964, according to data from the Census Bureau, the typical woman working full time made about 59 cents on the dollar earned by a man; by 2004, that had risen to 77 cents. (These calculations don’t take into account differences in experience, industry or other factors.) More recently, however, progress for women has nearly stalled out: In 2014, the latest data available, women earned 79 cents for every dollar earned by men, a 2-pennies-an-hour improvement over a decade.2 Other measures of women’s progress in the workforce — their rate of employment, the likelihood that they will work in a historically male-dominated field, the rate at which they run big companies — show a similar pattern of what researchers Martha J. Bailey and Thomas A. DiPrete, in a new essay, call “five decades of remarkable but slowing change” for American women. Bailey and DiPrete’s essay serves as the introduction to a remarkable new collection of papers from the Russell Sage Foundation that examines the progress that women have — and haven’t — made over the past half-century. It isn’t a simple story. The U.S. has already made major, albeit incomplete, progress on many of the most obvious causes of gender inequality — explicit discrimination on pay,3 overt barriers to employment, taboos against working while raising children. What is left is a tangle of cultural norms, implicit biases, individual preferences and other, subtler forms of discrimination that are much harder to change or even to measure. Take the long-hours anecdote I described above. The rapid rise in pay for people working long hours has played a major role in the persistence of the overall gender wage gap, particularly for parents; new research in the Russell Sage Foundation volume estimates that the wage gap between mothers and fathers would be 15 percent smaller if the extra-hours increase hadn’t occurred. But that premium itself isn’t the result of discrimination, explicit or implicit; women who work long hours have seen even faster gains than men (although they still earn less on average). Rather, the trend contributes to the wage gap because men are so much more likely than women to work those long hours. That, in turn, is the result of a confluence of factors that are deeply embedded in the American economy and society: Women, on average, spend much more time than men on housework, while men — especially a certain category of highly educated, elite men — are expected to work as much as possible. And of course, most importantly, mothers are still far more likely than fathers to be the primary caregiver for their children. Government policies could make a difference — affordable child care, for example, could make it easier for women who want to work long hours to do so — but they can only go so far. The Russell Sage Foundation papers are full of such thorny issues. A rising share of the gender wage gap is driven by “pre-market” factors such as choice of industry and occupation; those issues can also be the result of explicit or implicit discrimination but are much harder to address than wage differentials within a given job. And even forces that should help close the gap, such as education, have proved insufficient: Women have for decades been more likely to attend college than men — there are now for the first time more female than male college graduates — yet the pay gap is widest among the most educated workers. Girls now outperform boys in many science and math subjects in high school, but women are still much less likely than men to work in many of the most lucrative technical fields; women have actually lost ground to men in computer science in recent decades. And the overall rate of “occupational desegregation” — women entering traditionally male-dominated fields and vice versa — has slowed. There are some encouraging signs for women. Those who do go into science and technology fields earn nearly as much as equally experienced men (though that isn’t true in computer science), suggesting the overall wage gap would narrow if more women entered so-called STEM fields. Moreover, the “motherhood penalty” — the relative decline in wages for women when they have children — has disappeared or even reversed for highly paid, highly educated women, perhaps because they are the most likely to have access to (and be able to afford) child care. That suggests that making child care more widely available could help narrow the gender pay gap for less-educated women, too — something that is looking more likely now that both major presidential candidates are advocating affordable-child-care plans. Culture is changing, too: Men are taking on a larger share of child-rearing responsibilities, though the division is still far from equal. Still, the overall picture painted by the Russell Sage Foundation research is one of slow, grinding and unsteady progress, and of barriers that are hard to define and even harder to resolve. Hillary Clinton may be poised to crack the ultimate glass ceiling, but true gender equality remains a long way off. The Olympic tax Speaking of high-earning (and high-flying) women, the internet was abuzz this week with stories about the hefty tax bill that gymnast Simone Biles and other Olympic medalists will face when they get back from Rio. The BBC estimated Biles will owe more than $40,000. A bipartisan bill to exempt Olympic winnings from taxes is gaining momentum in Congress. But the whole issue is getting blown out of proportion. The U.S. Olympics Committee awards bonuses to American medal winners: $25,000 for gold medals and smaller amounts for silver and bronze. Biles, with her five medals, will receive $110,000, which in theory could put her on the hook for more than $40,000 in taxes. (The medals themselves are also taxable, but their actual value is modest.) But it’s unlikely she’ll actually owe that much because Biles and other Olympians can deduct the cost of their training on their taxes. And in the case of high-profile Olympians such as Biles and swimmer Michael Phelps, their actual winnings are dwarfed by far more lucrative (and very much taxable) endorsement deals. By the time Biles cashes all those checks from Procter & Gamble, her Olympic tax bill will probably look like a rounding error. The Fed Newly released minutes from the Federal Reserve’s July meeting this week suggest that Board Chair Janet Yellen and her colleagues are still weighing whether to raise interest rates in September or wait until the economy improves further. Separate comments from key Fed officials this week indicated that new data since the Fed’s meeting hasn’t resolved the question. The Fed is in a tricky spot. The job market continues to show strength; May’s weak employment report looks more and more like a blip. But overall economic growth has been disappointing, and there have been recent signs that consumer spending — a key pillar of strength in recent months — is beginning to weaken. Then there is the election, which complicates the Fed’s task in two ways: Policymakers don’t want to intervene too close to the election, lest they appear to be trying to influence the outcome, and they also have to grapple with the possibility that the election itself, and the uncertainty around it, will affect the economy. Most economists still think the Fed will wait until after the election is over to raise rates. Number of the week Back in July, I wrote about the long-term decline in teen summer employment, particularly among lower-income youths. A report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics this week indicates the recovery is gradually reversing that decline: 53.2 percent of Americans ages 16 to 24 had jobs in July, up from 52.7 percent last year and 50.7 percent in 2013. The report didn’t break out teens specifically, but a look at the underlying data shows that the employment rate for teens rose, too. Moreover, the employment gap between low-income and more affluent teens narrowed somewhat, the latest sign that the improving economy is gradually benefiting the most vulnerable workers. More from us It’s pretty widely known at this point that hosting the Olympics is a lousy investment for a city to make. But the games look even worse compared to other big infrastructure projects, writes Clay Dillow in his FiveThirtyEight debut. The debate over trade used to be focused on Mexico. These days, it’s all about China. Andrew Flowers says the shift in focus is rooted in some pretty solid economic evidence. On Tuesday, I spent an hour on the radio talking with Krys Boyd of KERA in Dallas about FiveThirtyEight’s big recent project on gun deaths. Elsewhere Wal-Mart’s cost-saving mania is great for consumers and investors. Less so for local police departments, who are struggling to respond to the crimes that occur in the stores every day, write Shannon Pettypiece and David Voreacos in Bloomberg Businessweek. Antitrust law tends to focus on monopolies’ impact on consumers. But economist Marshall Steinbaum argues the increasing consolidation of many U.S. industries also contributes to rising inequality. The most widely cited measure of poverty among grade-school students — eligibility for free and reduced price lunch — substantially understates the level of inequality in the U.S. school system, writes Susan Dynarski in The Upshot. The Los Angeles Times takes a deep look at U.S. poverty and how Americans view it. CORRECTION (Aug. 19, 10:22 a.m.): An earlier version of a chart in this article was incorrectly labeled. It shows the gender-pay gap in terms of annual earnings, not hourly earnings. Footnotes These calculations are based on my own analysis of Current Population Survey microdata, via the Center for Economic Policy Research. The approach is based on that used by Kim A. Weeden, Youngjoo Cha and Mauricio Bucca in their forthcoming paper from the Russell Sage Foundation. Other data sources and definitions show somewhat different ratios but the same basic trend. Estimates for the amount of outright wage discrimination — a woman making less than an equally qualified man in the same job — vary by industry and by who is doing the analysis. But most economists agree on two things: The gap is much smaller than it used to be but hasn’t disappeared.

We shall use a campaign built for managing brand Goodluck Jonathan at some point, in the last dispensation, themed “… I Goodluck…Goodluck Jonathan…” May we bring to our recall that political campaigns are brands management tools; political ideas and flag bearers/contestants for given political offices are brands. Political parties have identities, competing with other political parties (‘market’ players), to satisfy identified needs…and seek patronage at a price. Like products and services brands, politicians need to create the desired impression that will sell them at the market place for competitive advantage(s). They should carefully craft their market and marketing objectives for enduring market position – leadership, competitive followership or laggards. All of the above underscores the reasons for engaging professional brand managers. For any brand to succeed, the process and quality of campaign/advertising, and marketing communication is very important. In addition, the extent and quality of brand management also impacts on the nature, extent and robustness of targeted audience persuasion, belief, involvement and engagement. The first time I saw the television advert “I AM GOODLUCK…GOODLUCK JONATHAN…”  I ‘enjoyed’ it – for many reasons. It hit me with a dazzle, from various angles. From the position of the ordinary television audience, it paints the picture of a politician aspiring to the office of presidency, offering himself for election. In doing so, the politician is encouraging the target listener to HOPE, by telling his own success story. His own story served as HOPE to his audience: presently deprived and lacking in so many respects, almost giving up. But the aspirant comes on to rekindle their hope. He encouraged them so much, and promised them that ‘because I did it, you too can do it’. From the perspective of professional brand management, however, it was more engaging as I saw that advert time and again. It made for a good opportunity to consider some imperatives in brands management; the ingredients for effective and persuasive communication. For the purpose of building up instructive contrast (and for the benefit of consumers of advertising products) let’s look at a product advert in this market, to enable a critical consideration for learning. Though the BABA BLUE TV commercial has been rested for some time, it readily comes to mind for its creative treatment. To wit, BABA BLUE TV Commercial is a concept built on value-driven communication for the establishment of (the) brand’s promise. By use of drama, the commercial aptly played out the reasons-for for brand BABA BLUE, a brand of candy with the added value of cold treatment. We won’t drive too far into analysing the TVC’s creative and strategic focus & thrust, to avoid selling the brand free on this page, but suffice that the creative product aired for the brand is a product of a creative process that adhered to some of the grand rules for effective advertising and marketing communication. For effective brand benefit communication, the creative process for any brand communication requires a clear understanding of prevalent market learning inclusive of the need to satisfy, consumer or target audience expectation/ traits and habits, activities of competition, prevalent market dynamics that should there-from help in determining desired own-brand’s positioning statement and creative inputs for developing the way forward. Choice of words and pictures are derived from a careful consideration of the above, on a step-by-step approach. By the tutelage some of us professionals were exposed to, being aware of the above-mentioned, alone, amounts to just about 60 percent of the requirements for objective-driven engagement; an understanding of methods of application is very important. As a rule, the process does not permit assumption.  The BABA BLUE creative team seem to have applied ample understanding of the target audience – the low class man and woman who will passively take in “sweet” and move on; they are jolly-good fellows who are given to drama/comedy. They will appreciate some comic slice-of-life treatment of otherwise serious situation. Therefore, each time the TVC is aired, it immediately endears friendship from among its target audience because of the relief it brings into their lives (by use of drama), the enlightenment and information, and above all, the brand promise it establishes FIRMLY. For effectiveness, the creative process must be single-minded in its objective and creative treatment. In this case, literary treatment is very important. The advert copy/script must avoid ambiguity and emphasise clarity. So, again you find that the BABA BLUE concept played out in the courtroom setting, and clearly established its value-essence and promise through a very concise PROBLEM-SOLUTION treatment. The news here is that the creative concept behind BABA BLUE is the vintage PROCTER & GAMBLE character. The group’s endearing copy strategy is one of the first official hand-over(s) we got when we worked on the Euro Pampers and Vicks Lemon Plus brands, time past. It observes the rules for effective brands communication. Perhaps the team that worked on the “I AM GOODLUCK…” TVC needed to look into the P&G copy strategy. What came out strong in that creative product is an over-play on emotion. Yes, we appreciate the fact that creative concept can rest on either rational or emotional appeal, but even when campaigns are built on emotion, those involved must be careful not to lose focus on set-objective(s) and target audience profile. The brand must not come confused in terms of reasons-why. Credibility suffered a hit on the part of Brand Jonathan, and the target audience safeguard against credulity was undermined by the creative team behind that project. There was no way the brand would have been believed with both gender across all age-brackets saying “I am Goodluck Jonathan…” – let us leave out the other deliveries on that commercial, to save time. A lot of people who listened to that commercial came out asking wetin be this? So we ask WHO MANAGES YOUR BRAND? How much of the understanding of the creative process resides in the team you engage for the management of your brand. The lesson here, once again, is that the size of your brand’s market success depends also on the quality of your creative team and process. If the mix is right, the brand, the consumer/target audience and indeed the investor gains. Otherwise, everybody suffers. That is why we bother. Our suggestion is for brand owners/managers to rethink their choice of brand managers. We emphasise the need to engage professionals instead of “businessmen” in the business of advertising, if they desire to be competitive, customer-centric for market success, good returns on their advertising investment. On the ‘I AM GOODLUCK…GOODLUCK JONATHAN…’ campaign, which we have looked at as a case study, we would rather that the readers fill in the gap, using the BABA BLUE learning aid, to avoid being seen as partisan. We are only looking at the need for deep thinking for consumer-friendly creative advert products.   Facebook Twitter Google+ reddit LinkedIn StumbleUpon See How I Satisfied My Woman For Over 30 mins in Bed and Enlarge my penis size without Side Effect(Click Here To Read) Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus « Previous Article PDP Chairmanship Tussle: Conflicting Judgments Put Judiciary In The Spotlight Next Article » The Prolonged Leadership Capital Deficit In Nigeria Latest Posts 7:19 pm NVMA Appoints Godwin Abonyi New President — Comment 6:37 pm Ondo Guber: We Are Ready For Election – APC — Comment 6:29 pm Ondo Guber: Ekweremadu Hails Eyitayo’s Reinstatement — Comment 6:21 pm Akeredolu Accuses Oke Of Thugs Importation To Cause Violence — Comment 6:16 pm Dogara: Overlap Of Corruption Investigation Between EFCC, DSS Untidy — Comment 6:10 pm Appeal Court Verdict On Ondo Guber: Jimoh Ibrahim Heads To Supreme Court — Comment 6:01 pm Ondo Guber: Jubilation In Akure Over Jegede’s victory, As Kuku Denies Supporting Olusola Oke — Comment 5:50 pm Lagos Cancels Monthly Environmental Sanitation — Comment 5:42 pm N22.8b Fraud: Court Rules On Ex-Air Force Chief, Amosu, Others’ Application Thursday — Comment 5:39 pm Rivers Rerun: Wike Accuses Inec Of Handing Over Original Result Sheets To Amaechi — Comment Join Leadership Community Forum Poll Should The Federal Government Swap Detained Boko Haram Members For Chibok Girls?

Diamond won First Place in the “Sustainability – Folding Cartons” category for L’Oreal USA’s Matrix Oil Wonders promotional packaging. The carton was converted utilizing KapStone Kraftpak® high-yield, low density paperboard and printed with UV flexo white, opaque white, four color process, and dense black inks, in-line with UV varnish. Printed opaque white dots provide a perfect counterpoint to the brilliant gold foil stamped dots, creating dimension and visual interest. Gold foil surrounds the die cut windows, framing the hair care products within and drawing attention to the free product sample inside. The interplay between the unbleached paperboard and foil accents create shimmering metallic effects that are very unusual for a kraft-type folding carton. Diamond won Second Place in the “Sustainability – Folding Cartons” category for Gurwitch Products’ Laura Mercier Verbena Infusion folding carton. The carton was converted utilizing FSC-certified Invercote G paperboard and offset printed with two PMS green and black inks, in-line with UV matte coating. Printing on the reverse side of the board contributes to the product's natural aesthetic, while the subtle foil stamping and embossing accents on the front, side, and top panels infuses the visual with a rich, exotic quality. All of Diamond’s winning entries were manufactured using 100% clean, renewable wind energy and produced in a Zero Manufacturing Waste to Landfill (ZMWL) facility.
