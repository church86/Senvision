Unlike newspaper or television ads, online advertising can be aimed precisely at the very people a company wants to reach, so businesses won’t waste money by showing ads to those consumers outside predetermined parameters. Recommended for You Mind Reading Algorithms Reconstruct What You’re Seeing Using Brain Scan Data Apple-Picking Robot Prepares to Compete for Farm Jobs Real or Fake? AI Is Making It Very Hard to Know An Ostrich-Like Robot Pushes the Limits of Legged Locomotion Nvidia Lets You Peer Inside the Black Box of Its Self-Driving AI Then last year Procter & Gamble’s chief marketing officer, Marc Pritchard, declared that the company would pull back on ad targeting on Facebook. One of a number of recent announcements by Pritchard regarding P&G’s dissatisfaction with digital advertising, the news led some to question the value of digital advertising’s distinguishing characteristic: its capacity to target narrow segments of the population. P&G’s reëvaluation of its approach is part of a trend that appears to be growing among advertisers, says Tom Riordan, special operations consultant at Adobe Advertising Cloud, a platform that helps advertisers manage ad strategy and measurement (see “The End of Internet Advertising as We Know It”). The movement has yet to show up in the overall numbers, however, as digital ad spending continues to climb. Research firm eMarketer predicts that U.S. digital ad spending will experience double-digit growth from $83 billion this year, or about 40 percent of the overall projected $206 billion that will be spent on all advertising in 2017, to more than $129 billion in 2021. Typically, the more targeted the ads, the higher the prices. The types of digital targeting that can boost ad prices vary widely. Targeting allows businesses not just to advertise a pair of shoes or an SUV someone just looked at online but to aim ads based on geographic, demographic, and psychographic data (see “Has Big Data Made Anonymity Impossible?”). Or audience targets can be narrowed based on data from a wide variety of providers, such as information about previous purchases or about the current weather in a consumer’s location. But how effectively does that information work to meet advertiser goals? As advertisers including P&G, which spends billions of dollars each year on all its advertising for brands including Crest, Old Spice, and Gillette, have tried to assess the effectiveness of their increasing digital ad budgets, they’ve discovered that hyper-targeting consumers doesn’t always work. When a beer brand wanted to hit a thin slice of the male audience, calorie-conscious men aged 21 to 27, Adobe tested the tactic and showed the client that perhaps it was looking through the wrong goggles to gauge success. By making its ad campaign less targeted, the brand lowered the cost of each ad impression and in the end sold more beer. Opening the target audience to a wider 21-to-34-year-old range led new households to purchase the product, Riordan says.

Incorrect email format Manage your newsletter preferences Advertisers are certainly not abandoning the practice of targeting ads, but they are realizing that sometimes their original targets are wrong. When aiming ads for its fitness apparel at the 18-to-24-year-old men who wore it, one advertiser realized it was “mothers and wives buying for their sons and husbands” who were really driving the sales, says Ric Elert, president of Conversant Media, a digital ad firm whose roots are in direct or personalized digital marketing. “The answer is not whether you should do refined targeting or not. Of course you should do refined targeting,” says Irwin Gotlieb, chairman of GroupM Global, the media agency that controls the largest chunk of the world’s ad spending, which works with P&G in international markets and its competitor Unilever overseas and in the U.S. The mistake companies have made, he says, is to rely too much on targeted advertising, cutting too far back on broader advertising that builds brand awareness with people outside the existing customer base and eventually leads to new sales. A heavy emphasis on targeting can sometimes improve a company’s return on its advertising investment in the short term, says Gotlieb, but lead to a loss in market share over time. Rather than a referendum on all digital targeting, pronouncements by companies like P&G may be a sign of maturity in the online advertising market as it assesses what this strategy can do very well and what it cannot.

The results were released one day before Berkshire’s annual meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, where Buffett, 86, and Berkshire Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, 93, will answer five hours of questions from shareholders, journalists and analysts. That meeting is the centrepiece of a festive weekend of events throughout Omaha expected to draw more than 37,000 shareholders. Net income fell to US$4.06 billion (RM17.6), or US$2,469 per Class A share, from US$5.59 billion, or US$3,401, a year earlier, when Berkshire had a US$1.9 billion gain from its swap of its Procter & Gamble Co stock for the Duracell battery business. Quarterly operating profit, which excludes investment and derivative gains and losses, fell 5 per cent to a three-year low of US$3.56 billion, or US$2,163 per Class A share, from US$3.74 billion, or US$2,274. Analysts on average expected operating profit of about US$2,666 per Class A share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Buffett believes Berkshire’s investment and derivative gains in any given quarter are often meaningless, but accounting rules require Berkshire to report them in its earnings statements. Despite the earnings shortfall, Buffett’s preferred measure of growth for Berkshire, book value per Class A share, or assets minus liabilities, rose 3.5 per cent in the quarter to US$178,073. The conglomerate also ended the quarter with roughly US$96.5 billion of cash, equivalents and Treasury bills, a record sum and enough for one or more major acquisitions. Berkshire has more than 90 operating units in insurance, chemical, energy, food and clothing, railroad and other sectors, and also has large investments in stocks of companies such as Apple Inc and Wells Fargo & Co. Many Berkshire units are selling their wares at discounted prices at the annual meeting, while others offer memorabilia such as “Berky” boxers and bras, talking Warren Buffett dolls, and rubber ducks that look like Buffett and Munger for US$5 a pair. Buffett has led Berkshire since 1965. AIG deal weighs, BNSF gains Berkshire said its insurance businesses swung to a US$267 million underwriting loss from a year-earlier profit of US$213 million. This reflected higher losses from catastrophes in 2017, including an Australian cyclone in March; unexpectedly high losses related to hurricanes and earthquakes in 2016, and weaker results at the auto insurer Geico and the reinsurer General Re. It also reflected the amortization of deferred charges from Berkshire’s January agreement to take on many long-term risks in American International Group Inc’s property and casualty portfolio, in exchange for US$10.2 billion upfront. That payment helped boost float, or the amount of insurance premiums collected before claims are paid and which helps fund Berkshire’s growth, to about US$105 billion from US$91 billion at the end of 2016. It also helped boost quarterly revenue 25 per cent to US$65.19 billion. Quarter-to-quarter swings “are about the mix of business and what is coming due, and what is being renewed,” said Cole Smead, portfolio manager at Smead Capital Management in Seattle. “This is not a disaster.” It is unclear whether Berkshire booked losses as Buffett began selling some of its stock in IBM Corp, which it has owned for about six years. Buffett told CNBC on Thursday he sold about one-third of Berkshire’s 81 million share stake in IBM this year, and no longer values the computer services company as highly as before. In other businesses, the BNSF railroad saw profit rise 7 per cent to US$838 million, helped by higher revenue from fuel surcharges and increased shipments of consumer products. Berkshire Hathaway Energy, a utility unit mostly owned by Berkshire, saw profit rise 14 per cent to US$501 million, helped by lower pension and maintenance costs at the PacifiCorp electric utility and a better rate structure for natural gas pipeline operator Kern River. In Friday trading, Berkshire Class A shares rose 0.2 per cent to US$250,000 and its Class B shares rose 0.1 per cent to US$166.55. The shares are roughly 6 per cent below record highs set on March 2. — Reuters                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Bursa to trend higher towards 1,770 points level next week Crude rebound eases markets but concerns linger Positive exports data to lift ringgit next week Insurance dampens Berkshire results before annual meeting Wall Street edges up as US job growth rebounds Firefly says cut Penang flights due to weak ringgit, competition Bitcoin soars above US$1,400 to all-time high Singapore Air may land unfamiliar net-debt spot by 2018 Ringgit rebounds as Asia’s FX laggards turn leaders of pack Abdul Wahid: More listed Islamic financial institutions needed on Bursa Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: Thousands enjoy al fresco 'waste food' feast in Los Angeles Reuters Video: Moon rover debuts in 'Alien' movie Reuters Video: Macron stretches lead as French presidential campaign enters final day Reuters Video: Cast and crew of ‘The Beguiled’ discuss the remake Tilda Swinton unveils strange ‘Okja’ promo clip Reuters Video: Thai man murders baby, commits suicide on Facebook Live Related Articles Buffett’s Berkshire, Chinese property portal Juwai.com team up Warren Buffett adorns Cherry Coke cans in China Buffett’s pay rises; Berkshire urges rejection of shareholder proposals For Warren Buffett, best days for the US always lie ahead Buffett scorns tricky Wall Street accounting, but defends buybacks Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

That meeting is the centerpiece of a festive weekend of events throughout Omaha expected to draw more than 37,000 shareholders.   Net income fell to $4.06 billion, or $2,469 per Class A share, from $5.59 billion, or $3,401, a year earlier, when Berkshire had a $1.9 billion gain from its swap of its Procter & Gamble Co stock for the Duracell battery business.   Quarterly operating profit, which excludes investment and derivative gains and losses, fell 5 percent to a three-year low of $3.56 billion, or $2,163 per Class A share, from $3.74 billion, or $2,274. Analysts on average expected operating profit of about $2,666 per Class A share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.   Buffett believes Berkshire's investment and derivative gains in any given quarter are often meaningless, but accounting rules require Berkshire to report them in its earnings statements. Despite the earnings shortfall, Buffett's preferred measure of growth for Berkshire, book value per Class A share, or assets minus liabilities, rose 3.5 percent in the quarter to $178,073.   The conglomerate also ended the quarter with roughly $96.5 billion of cash, equivalents and Treasury bills, a record sum and enough for one or more major acquisitions. Berkshire has more than 90 operating units in insurance, chemical, energy, food and clothing, railroad and other sectors, and also has large investments in stocks of companies such as Apple Inc and Wells Fargo & Co.   Many Berkshire units are selling their wares at discounted prices at the annual meeting, while others offer memorabilia such as "Berky" boxers and bras, talking Warren Buffett dolls, and rubber ducks that look like Buffett and Munger for $5 a pair. Buffett has led Berkshire since 1965.   Berkshire said its insurance businesses swung to a $267 million underwriting loss from a year-earlier profit of $213 million. This reflected higher losses from catastrophes in 2017, including an Australian cyclone in March; unexpectedly high losses related to hurricanes and earthquakes in 2016, and weaker results at the auto insurer Geico and the reinsurer General Re.   It also reflected the amortization of deferred charges from Berkshire's January agreement to take on many long-term risks in American International Group Inc's property and casualty portfolio, in exchange for $10.2 billion upfront. That payment helped boost float, or the amount of insurance premiums collected before claims are paid and which helps fund Berkshire's growth, to about $105 billion from $91 billion at the end of 2016. It also helped boost quarterly revenue 25 percent to $65.19 billion.   Quarter-to-quarter swings "are about the mix of business and what is coming due, and what is being renewed," said Cole Smead, portfolio manager at Smead Capital Management in Seattle. "This is not a disaster."   It is unclear whether Berkshire booked losses as Buffett began selling some of its stock in IBM Corp, which it has owned for about six years. Buffett told CNBC on Thursday he sold about one-third of Berkshire's 81 million share stake in IBM this year, and no longer values the computer services company as highly as before.

OMAHA, Neb.: Berkshire Hathaway Inc, the conglomerate run by billionaire investor Warren Buffett, reported a 27 percent decline in first-quarter profit on Friday, and said a loss from insurance underwriting contributed to operating results that fell short of forecasts. The results were released one day before Berkshire's annual meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, where Buffett, 86, and Berkshire Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, 93, will answer five hours of questions from shareholders, journalists and analysts. That meeting is the centerpiece of a festive weekend of events throughout Omaha expected to draw more than 37,000 shareholders. Net income fell to $4.06 billion, or $2,469 per Class A share, from $5.59 billion, or $3,401, a year earlier, when Berkshire had a $1.9 billion gain from its swap of its Procter & Gamble Co <PG.N> stock for the Duracell battery business. Quarterly operating profit, which excludes investment and derivative gains and losses, fell 5 percent to a three-year low of $3.56 billion, or $2,163 per Class A share, from $3.74 billion, or $2,274. Analysts on average expected operating profit of about $2,666 per Class A share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Buffett believes Berkshire's investment and derivative gains in any given quarter are often meaningless, but accounting rules require Berkshire to report them in its earnings statements. Despite the earnings shortfall, Buffett's preferred measure of growth for Berkshire, book value per Class A share, or assets minus liabilities, rose 3.5 percent in the quarter to $178,073. The conglomerate also ended the quarter with roughly $96.5 billion of cash, equivalents and Treasury bills, a record sum and enough for one or more major acquisitions. Berkshire has more than 90 operating units in insurance, chemical, energy, food and clothing, railroad and other sectors, and also has large investments in stocks of companies such as Apple Inc <AAPL.O> and Wells Fargo & Co <WFC.N>. Many Berkshire units are selling their wares at discounted prices at the annual meeting, while others offer memorabilia such as "Berky" boxers and bras, talking Warren Buffett dolls, and rubber ducks that look like Buffett and Munger for $5 a pair. Buffett has led Berkshire since 1965. AIG DEAL WEIGHS, BNSF GAINS Berkshire said its insurance businesses swung to a $267 million underwriting loss from a year-earlier profit of $213 million. This reflected higher losses from catastrophes in 2017, including an Australian cyclone in March; unexpectedly high losses related to hurricanes and earthquakes in 2016, and weaker results at the auto insurer Geico and the reinsurer General Re. It also reflected the amortization of deferred charges from Berkshire's January agreement to take on many long-term risks in American International Group Inc's <AIG.N> property and casualty portfolio, in exchange for $10.2 billion upfront. That payment helped boost float, or the amount of insurance premiums collected before claims are paid and which helps fund Berkshire's growth, to about $105 billion from $91 billion at the end of 2016. It also helped boost quarterly revenue 25 percent to $65.19 billion. Quarter-to-quarter swings "are about the mix of business and what is coming due, and what is being renewed," said Cole Smead, portfolio manager at Smead Capital Management in Seattle. "This is not a disaster." It is unclear whether Berkshire booked losses as Buffett began selling some of its stock in IBM Corp <IBM.N>, which it has owned for about six years. Buffett told CNBC on Thursday he sold about one-third of Berkshire's 81 million share stake in IBM this year, and no longer values the computer services company as highly as before. In other businesses, the BNSF railroad saw profit rise 7 percent to $838 million, helped by higher revenue from fuel surcharges and increased shipments of consumer products. Berkshire Hathaway Energy, a utility unit mostly owned by Berkshire, saw profit rise 14 percent to $501 million, helped by lower pension and maintenance costs at the PacifiCorp electric utility and a better rate structure for natural gas pipeline operator Kern River. In Friday trading, Berkshire Class A shares rose 0.2 percent to $250,000 and its Class B shares rose 0.1 percent to $166.55. The shares are roughly 6 percent below record highs set on March 2.- Reuters Tags / Keywords: Stocks , Earnings , Investing , Markets Related Stories You May Be Interested Supermax’s 20/20 vision Malaysian palm oil price rebounds in evening trade on weaker ringgit Bank Rakyat announces 15% dividend payment for 2016 Group of Google veterans starts self-driving tech firm Bukit Gasing trees partially sawn by vandals, pose a danger Seven reasons to get an iPhone now Others Also Read Turkish court rejects Wikipedia's appeal over website's blocking When Taman Melawati folk come out to play Five Thai border policemen injured in bomb attack near Golok River Property Related advertisement Latest News Insurance dampens billionaire Buffett's Berkshire results before annual meeting Malaysian palm oil price rebounds in evening trade on weaker ringgit Oil rebound eases markets, US stocks hit record high S&P 500 hits record on rebound in US job growth, energy shares Malaysia Airports reaches settlement with two KLIA2 consultants Most Viewed in Business New names, new value Malton group, Dalian, EPF to team up for job?

(Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway Inc , the conglomerate run by billionaire investor Warren Buffett, reported a 27 percent decline in first-quarter profit on Friday, and said a loss from insurance underwriting contributed to operating results that fell short of forecasts. The results were released one day before Berkshire's annual meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, where Buffett, 86, and Berkshire Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, 93, will answer five hours of questions from shareholders, journalists and analysts. That meeting is the centrepiece of a festive weekend of events throughout Omaha expected to draw more than 37,000 shareholders. Net income fell to $4.06 billion, or $2,469 per Class A share, from $5.59 billion, or $3,401, a year earlier, when Berkshire had a $1.9 billion gain from its swap of its Procter & Gamble Co stock for the Duracell battery business. Quarterly operating profit, which excludes investment and derivative gains and losses, fell 5 percent to a three-year low of $3.56 billion, or $2,163 per Class A share, from $3.74 billion, or $2,274. Analysts on average expected operating profit of about $2,666 per Class A share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Buffett believes Berkshire's investment and derivative gains in any given quarter are often meaningless, but accounting rules require Berkshire to report them in its earnings statements. Despite the earnings shortfall, Buffett's preferred measure of growth for Berkshire, book value per Class A share, or assets minus liabilities, rose 3.5 percent in the quarter to $178,073. The conglomerate also ended the quarter with roughly $96.5 billion of cash, equivalents and Treasury bills, a record sum and enough for one or more major acquisitions. Berkshire has more than 90 operating units in insurance, chemical, energy, food and clothing, railroad and other sectors, and also has large investments in stocks of companies such as Apple Inc and Wells Fargo & Co . Many Berkshire units are selling their wares at discounted prices at the annual meeting, while others offer memorabilia such as "Berky" boxers and bras, talking Warren Buffett dolls, and rubber ducks that look like Buffett and Munger for $5 a pair. Buffett has led Berkshire since 1965. AIG DEAL WEIGHS, BNSF GAINS Berkshire said its insurance businesses swung to a $267 million underwriting loss from a year-earlier profit of $213 million. This reflected higher losses from catastrophes in 2017, including an Australian cyclone in March; unexpectedly high losses related to hurricanes and earthquakes in 2016, and weaker results at the auto insurer Geico and the reinsurer General Re. It also reflected the amortization of deferred charges from Berkshire's January agreement to take on many long-term risks in American International Group Inc's property and casualty portfolio, in exchange for $10.2 billion upfront. That payment helped boost float, or the amount of insurance premiums collected before claims are paid and which helps fund Berkshire's growth, to about $105 billion from $91 billion at the end of 2016. It also helped boost quarterly revenue 25 percent to $65.19 billion. Quarter-to-quarter swings "are about the mix of business and what is coming due, and what is being renewed," said Cole Smead, portfolio manager at Smead Capital Management in Seattle. "This is not a disaster." It is unclear whether Berkshire booked losses as Buffett began selling some of its stock in IBM Corp , which it has owned for about six years. Buffett told CNBC on Thursday he sold about one-third of Berkshire's 81 million share stake in IBM this year, and no longer values the computer services company as highly as before. In other businesses, the BNSF railroad saw profit rise 7 percent to $838 million, helped by higher revenue from fuel surcharges and increased shipments of consumer products. Berkshire Hathaway Energy, a utility unit mostly owned by Berkshire, saw profit rise 14 percent to $501 million, helped by lower pension and maintenance costs at the PacifiCorp electric utility and a better rate structure for natural gas pipeline operator Kern River. In Friday trading, Berkshire Class A shares rose 0.2 percent to $250,000 and its Class B shares rose 0.1 percent to $166.55. The shares are roughly 6 percent below record highs set on March 2.

Ya Libnan Lebanon News and World News Live from Beirut Featured News Lebanon News World News Opinion Business News Arts & Culture Sci & Tech Video Apple’s cash pile of $250 billion fuels expectations April 30, 2017 by yalibnan 2 Comments In its quarterly results on Tuesday, Apple Inc. likely will report that its cash hoard has topped a quarter of a trillion dollars, an unrivaled milestone for a private corporation that raises a question: Why would any company want to hold that much money? Apple has added to its pile at a blistering pace, doubling it in just over four-and-a-half years. In the last three months of 2016 it wracked up new cash at a rate of about $3.6 million an hour. Its current total, not accounting for debt, exceeds the market values of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and that of Procter & Gamble Co., and outstrips the foreign-currency reserves of the U.K. and Canada combined. The stash has drawn fresh attention recently as President Donald Trump tries to revamp the U.S. tax regime. Apple, like many big companies, keeps most of its cash offshore — some 93% of its $246.09 billion total cash, cash equivalents, and securities as of December — to avoid U.S. corporate taxes that executives consider too high. The Trump administration this week proposed a one-time tax holiday to encourage companies to bring that cash home, and said it wants to slash the U.S. corporate-income-tax rate to 15% from 35% and largely exempt future foreign profits. That could make it easier for Apple to put its money to use, through acquisitions or by doling out more to shareholders. The latter prospect has propelled Apple’s stock to record highs. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook early this year said he was eager to bring cash home if tax changes enable it, and Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said such a move would give Apple flexibility to do more capital returns. Neither has given detailed plans. One possible approach would be a special dividend. Apple could deliver such a windfall, benefitting investors including Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc., which more than doubled its Apple position in January. Wall Street analysts tend to focus more on companies’ net cash position than the headline number. Apple has racked up some $88 billion in debt to fund payouts to shareholders. But even subtracting that, Apple would be left with more cash than the total stockpile of Microsoft, the next richest tech company, which boasts $126 billion in cash, not accounting for debt. With the exception of financial companies, Apple’s stash exceeds that of any other U.S. company in recent history, said Jennifer Blouin, an accounting professor at University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School. “I have never seen a company in this kind of extreme position, barring a winding-down,” she said. “Apple’s a cash box right now.” Former executives say Apple’s thrift has deep roots, inspired in part by a brush with bankruptcy in the late 1990s. That forced Chief Executive Steve Jobs to arrange a cash infusion from Microsoft Corp. and set his resolve to keep reserves for future emergencies. Mr. Jobs also believed Apple could better boost its stock price by using its money to develop new products than through buybacks or dividends. His biggest product, the iPhone, has only supercharged the cash machine. Apple has sold more than 1 billion of the devices in the decade since it was introduced, and today claims 91% of all the profits in the smartphone sector. Mr. Cook has been somewhat more accommodating of shareholder desires than his predecessor. He started a dividend-and-stock-buyback program in 2012 that has since sent more than $200 billion to shareholders. And he has invested more in some areas, such as R&D. But the CEO also stared down Carl Icahn in 2013 and 2014 when the activist investor bought a stake in Apple and demanded it increase buybacks. And Apple remains frugal in other realms, such as marketing. It spent less than $1.8 billion on advertising last year — not even half the amounts laid out by smaller rivals Alphabet Inc. and Amazon.com Inc., according to company filings. Apple also avoids large acquisitions. It bought at a rate of 15 to 20 companies a year over the past four years, generally spending several hundred million dollars on companies it can easily assimilate. Its biggest deal was the $3 billion it spent to buy Beats Electronics LLC in 2014. The swelling war chest has fueled hopes for bigger deals to vault Apple in new directions such as self-driving cars and entertainment. At Apple’s 2015 shareholder meeting, one investor asked Mr. Cook about buying Tesla Inc., which today is valued around $51 billion. The CEO didn’t directly respond. Robert Nichols of Windward Capital Management Co., an Apple shareholder, says it should buy Netflix Inc., valued around $65 billion, to jumpstart its video-streaming business and bolster its position against Amazon. “You can either build [content and distribution] or you can buy it,” and buying would help Apple gain ground where it is behind, he said. With $250 billion, Apple could buy both Tesla and Netflix and still have plenty left over. It also might want to use some cash to pay down some of its debt or look to boost U.S. manufacturing after facing calls last year from then-President-elect Trump to build a plant in the U.S. Either way, there is a growing sense that Apple’s cash hoard has far outstripped its needs. “If this a rainy day fund, they’re saving for a millennial flood,” said Lee Pinkowitz, a Georgetown University professor of finance.   FOX Filed Under: Business News vs Facebook tries to fix violent video problem with 3,000 new workers http://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-crime-idUSKBN17Z1N4 elie meanwhile chinese are working under shitty conditions in apple factories.

Apple’s cash pile has swelled to $250bn, a sum bigger than the market value of Wal-Mart or Procter & Gamble. It also eclipses the foreign currency reserves of Britain and Canada combined. Apple’s lucrative products help explain why the cash pile has burgeoned; so does the group’s historic tendency to avoid big acquisitions as well as dividends or buybacks. Ninety per cent of the money is held overseas to avoid high US corporate taxes. Viewpoint “French productivity, measured by GDP per hour worked, is higher than in Britain to an almost embarrassing extent. Figures published by the Office for National Statistics this month showed that productivity in France is 29.4% higher… I have always argued that this is because Britain is a higher-employment, lower-investment economy than France, where restrictive labour laws discourage employment and, where it is an alternative, encourage firms to invest. While a machine gets on with it, a French worker responds with a Gallic shrug. But that French worker has significantly more capital equipment than their British equivalent.” David Smith, The Sunday Times More from MoneyWeek KIDS' PORTFOLIO Investing for your children's long-term future is an excellent idea.

It’s all at issue as Donald Trump’s point woman on American education speaks to HBCU grads. BY THE FLORIDA COURIER STAFF In Daytona Beach, the home of Bethune-Cookman University, protesters marched down Dr. Mary McLeod Bethune Boulevard, where the school is located, on Wednesday. (DUANE C. FERNANDEZ SR. / HARDNOTTSPHOTOGRAPHY.COM) DAYTONA BEACH – After days of rumors circulating among Bethune-Cookman University (B-CU) alumni and students that prominent school choice advocate and current U.S. Department of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos would be the Class of 2017’s commencement speaker on May 10, confirmation of DeVos’s appearance quickly spiraled into a political battle that attracted national media attention. DeVos has been harshly criticized among advocates of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) as a consequence of a press statement she issued during this year’s Black History Month observance in February. The statement read, in part, “…we must be willing to make the tangible, structural reforms that will allow students to reach their full potential. HBCUs…started from the fact that there were too many students in America who did not have equal access to education… “HBCUs are real pioneers when it comes to school choice. They are living proof that when more options are provided to students, they are afforded greater access and greater quality.” No historical context Her Feb. 28 statement didn’t mention that HBCUs originated as a response to a racist American system of higher education that, with few exceptions, refused to admit African-Americans to predominately White colleges and universities for almost 200 years of the nation’s history. Backlash followed soon after DeVos’s statement with many accusing her of ignoring and distorting America’s history of educational racism in a way that supports her advocacy for school voucher programs that take money away from public schools. Last week, the Florida Courier sent an email requesting that B-CU confirm or deny that DeVos would speak at commencement, but got no response. Once the rumor was mentioned online at Politico.com on April 30, B-CU President Edison Jackson confirmed that DeVos would speak in a May 1 “Message from the President.” The Department of Education officially announced the speech soon thereafter. Won’t shelter students “As a veteran educator, I am especially sensitive to balancing the notion of academic freedom with quelling potentially hateful and harmful rhetoric,” Jackson stated. “I am of the belief that it does not benefit our students to suppress voices that we disagree with, or to limit students to only those perspectives that are broadly sanctioned by a specific community. “When we seek to shelter our students and campus communities from views that are diametrically opposed to their own, we actually leave our students far less capable of combating those ideas.  Additionally, the sheer diversity of our human family requires us to listen to and understand one another.  We cannot, and we will not, ever accomplish this if we continue to exist in ideological, social, and racial silos.” Jackson went on to put the DeVos commencement speech in the context of actions taken by the school’s founder, Dr. Mary McLeod Bethune, to solicit support from oil barons John D. Rockefeller and Henry Flagler and James Proctor of the Proctor and Gamble company, among others. “These individuals represented diverse political and social views, but Dr. Bethune invited them all to visit and support her institution.  It is in that same vein that I have chosen to provide our students with an opportunity to hear from someone with whom they may disagree, but someone who has the ability to potentially influence their future,” Jackson explained. Blistering NAACP response Citing what it called DeVos’s “horrible public education record impacting Blacks and minorities in Florida and around the country,” the Florida State Conference of NAACP Branches responded to Jackson’s confirmation by asking DeVos to decline B-CU’s invitation to speak. “We believe the leadership of Bethune-Cookman University should not bestow an honorary degree to Secretary DeVos based on her post-secondary education record,” said state president Adora Obi Nweze, calling B-CU’s actions “unusual.” “Their plan (is) to honor a person who has been on the job less than one hundred days and has no record of advancing educational equity for all students… If Secretary DeVos ultimately speaks at commencement and receives an honorary degree, this would be a slap in the face to minorities, women and all communities of color,” Nweze exclaimed. Proxy war? The B-CU controversy laid bare the two sides battling for the direction of, and the dollars invested in, the American educational system. Republicans like DeVos – a billionaire GOP donor who has financially supported charter school and voucher advocates, including Black churches in Florida that run Christian charter schools – are generally on one side of the educational argument. The NAACP, teachers’ unions, and Democrats are on the other. Jackson is a registered Republican. DeVos is also scheduled to appear at a B-CU-hosted prayer breakfast at the Orlando’s Amway Center the day after commencement. Her father-in-law, Rich DeVos, founded the Amway Corporation and owns the Orlando Magic, the city’s National Basketball Association team. Dueling online petitions As of late Wednesday night, the Florida Courier’s press time, more than 5,500 people had signed an online petition, written and posted April 29 by B-CU alumnus Dominick Whitehead, to stop DeVos from speaking. “Last month DeVos weakened consumer protection for student loan borrowers. According to U.S. News & World Report, 97 percent of full-time undergraduates who attend BCU receive some sort of need-based financial aid,” Whitehead writes. “…(T)he median earning of a graduate from B-CU is approximate $22,000 per year for the first two years after graduating. This would make it virtually impossible to immediately begin to pay off an estimated $52,000 in student loan debt. “President Barack Obama’s administration offered income-based repayment plans and student loan forgiveness programs. DeVos’ April 11th memo threatens to dismantle those very helpful programs. This means that lenders will not have any restrictions while attempting to collect the money that was borrowed by students.” ‘Meaningful dialogue’ Instead of having DeVos speak at graduation, “let’s welcome her to the table and have meaningful dialogue about stronger policies, the White House HBCU Initiative, and the importance and contributions of HBCUs,” Whitehead suggests. A separate Change.org petition – posted by Nzhada Harris on May 1, the same day as Jackson’s ‘Message’ was distributed – supports DeVos’s appearance. “Education is a non-partisan issue that every individual should have the right to obtain,” the petition states. As of Wednesday night, it had 69 supporters. A student speaks Shavona Bouey, a senior mass communications major in B-CU’s 2017 graduating class, spoke exclusively to the Florida Courier. “As you can imagine, it’s been pretty chaotic for myself and other students to fully understand why Mrs. DeVos is being welcomed as the spring commencement speaker. Students even held a protest against Mrs. DeVos,” she asserted. “My mother and other family members don’t support the things Mrs. DeVos says and neither do I. HBCUs were created by force. African-Americans had no other options, or choice, I shall say.

The Lions’ winners will be honoured at awards ceremonies taking place across the eight day Festival, from 17-24 June. Encompassing a diverse spectrum of creative and international talent, 390 people from 50 countries across all juries are confirmed and two new countries – The Dominican Republic and Vietnam – join the panels for the first-time. 43% of jurors are female in 2017, a record for the Festival. The number of women on the juries has doubled in the last five years, from 21% in 2012. Terry Savage, Chairman of Cannes Lions, said “Our juries are developed in consultation with the industry and the progress we’ve achieved so far by working together is transforming the jury gender mix. We know the work doesn’t stop at gender and we look forward to working with the industry to tackle other representation issues.” Madonna Badger, CCO/Founder, Badger and Winters and Cannes Lions’ See it Be it Ambassador, commented “Cannes Lions’ commitment to diversity and equality shines a light for the entire industry. Whereas only 11% of Creative Directors are women, Cannes has increased the number of women on juries to 43% this year. The more the juries represent the ratio of men and women in the world, the better the awarded work will be.” Jose Papa, Managing Director of Cannes Lions, added “The job of the jury is to identify and award the very best in global creativity, recognising and celebrating work made by all people from all corners of the world. The make-up of this year’s juries marks another step forward in the Festival’s mission to improve diversity among its judges, and is something we’re committed to continuing in 2018 and beyond.” The 2017 juries are announced as: Cyber Jury President – Colleen DeCourcy, Global Chief Creative Officer, Wieden+Kennedy, Global Pablo Tajer, VP, Head of Digital Platforms, Grey, Argentina Andy Flemming, Group Creative Director, M&C Saatchi, Australia Katrien Bottez, Executive Creative Director, FamousGrey, Belgium Sergio Gordilho, Co-President & Chief Creative Officer, Africa, Brazil Jordan Doucette, Chief Creative Officer, Taxi Canada Ltd., Canada Benjamin Dessagne, Senior Copywriter, Buzzman, France Timm Weber, Chief Creative Officer, Publicis Pixelpark, Germany Eric Weisberg, Global Chief Creative Officer, Doner, Global Ritu Sharda, Senior Executive Creative Director, BBDO, India Sotaro Yasumochi, Creative Director, Dentsu Inc., Japan Gabriel Vazquez, Vice President Creative, J.

As the 86-year-old Buffett and his 93-year-old partner, Charlie Munger, advance in years, Weschler, 56, and Combs, 46, are expected to take over the giant company's investment portfolio, valued at more than $150 billion in common stocks, according to CNBC's Berkshire Hathaway Portfolio Tracker. show chapters Warren Buffett speaks to CNBC about the economy, Apple and selling IBM shares    19 Hours Ago | 16:11 But the way they were hired and the way their roles have evolved show some key lessons about how wealth and knowledge — and business empires, like $410 billion Berkshire Hathaway — are transferred and built to last. With Berkshire Hathaway shareholders set to return this weekend to Omaha like migrating birds to the place where they were born, more spotlight will shine on both Warren Buffett and the two former hedge fund managers who now run more than $20 billion of Berkshire's investments. Here's what you need to know about the two men who are being passed the torch by arguably the best investor in world history. 1. The best talent can be applied to roles beyond the most obvious. Their role was initially described as helping with the company's investment portfolio, which observers assumed meant plowing profits from Berkshire's operating companies into stocks of outside companies, as Buffett and Munger have done to great effect for decades. Berkshire has more than $90 billion in cash currently. But the former hedge fund managers' responsibilities have proved to be much more than just finding new stock bets for Berkshire. More from iCONIC: The CEO who writes the letters Buffett likes to read Business lessons from the tech CEO Buffett calls 'remarkable' How Tim Cook followed the toughest CEO act in tech to success More than a third of the $21 billion they manage — and since Buffett's letter says each runs more than $10 billion independently, they split duties pretty equally — is money from pension funds at Berkshire subsidiaries, a job that was outsourced before. Berkshire has more than 60 operating subsidiaries. They also apparently supervise some operating companies, the core of Berkshire Hathaway's conglomerate business model. Combs said in an April 2017 interview with Yahoo Finance that both he and Weschler have operating companies reporting up to them. 2. If you bring talent in, you better trust it. The two managers will occasionally sound out Buffett about investments, and they all have a regular lunch together on Mondays. But Buffett says that as often as not, he learns about their buys and their sells from monthly position reports. "They don't have to check in before they buy or sell anything," Buffett recently told Yahoo. "It's entirely their decision.'' Both are also hedge fund veterans, hired despite the boss' tweaking of hedge funds over fees, and for a long time. Weschler's fund reportedly rose 1,236 percent before he closed it over an 11-year period, trouncing Buffett's 146 percent gain over the same time frame. 3. No matter how smart you are, new blood will lead to new ways of thinking. Weschler in particular is credited with convincing Buffett to look at industries, notably technology, that he has previously left to other investors. He's the godfather of Berkshire's investment in Apple, which began with a $1 billion purchase disclosed last May at an average price of just under $100 a share. Apple's up nearly 50 percent since, and Berkshire now owns roughly 2.4 percent of Apple shares at a value of roughly $20 billion. Over the years, Buffett never liked to dabble in tech himself, and the divergence between the Apple bet and Buffett's bet on IBM may show the value of new perspectives. Buffett made his IBM mea culpa to CNBC on Thursday, saying he had lowered his valuation of the company and sold one-third of his stake when it hit $180 — but he stills owns a ton. But even in old-school economy areas where Buffett is a master — consumer stocks and industrials — the new managers brought new ways of thinking. For his part, Combs is credited with convincing Buffett and Munger to buy battery-maker Duracell — and sell long-time stock-holding and Duracell parent Procter & Gamble. He also convinced Berkshire to spend $37.2 billion in 2015 to buy Precision Castparts, a maker of equipment for the aerospace and energy industries. 4. Like-habits of success are more important than like-minds on everything. Buffett's genius ultimately is about reading more and knowing more than most people, and the protégés are a lot like him, or so they told Yahoo Finance. Both are data nerds who put in the hours: Combs describes his average day as reading documents from about 7 a.m. to 7 p.m., with more reading at home later. "These were the only two guys we (meaning himself and Munger) could find who read as much as we did," Buffett said to Yahoo. Combs said Buffett's advice is to read hundreds of pages a week about business. 5. The next generation of empire builders can come from outside the gates, but it can build on the boss in unexpected ways. Weschler was a two-time winner of a charity auction for the right to have lunch with Buffett, spending more than $5 million for the privilege. Combs says he first saw Buffett during an appearance at Columbia Business School, were Combs was a student and Buffett an alumnus. The $21 billion the two managers run is still a pretty small slice of the $150-billion-plus in outside stock investments. The company's four biggest stock positions as of Dec. 31 — Wells Fargo, IBM, American Express and Coca-Cola — are all the boss' picks. But the surging value of Apple — and Berkshire's decision to rapidly expand its position — place it among Berkshire's top bets now that Buffett has put capital he runs alongside money first committed by Weschler. Buffett told CNBC on Thursday that owning Apple is about the long term: "I don't own [Apple] because of what I think the earnings are going to be in the next three months or six months." He also talked about Apple as a "consumer product" play, rather than tech-industry play, showing where the younger minds, more nimble in tech, have built a bridge to Buffett's large legacy investment in consumer stocks. — By Tim Mullaney, special to CNBC.com iCONIC Tour Full Coverage of the iCONIC Tour To view this site, you need to have JavaScript enabled in your browser, and either the Flash Plugin or an HTML5-Video enabled browser.

The Lions’ winners will be honoured at awards ceremonies taking place across the eight day Festival, from 17-24 June. Encompassing a diverse spectrum of creative and international talent, 390 people from 50 countries across all juries are confirmed and two new countries – The Dominican Republic and Vietnam – join the panels for the first-time. 43% of jurors are female in 2017, a record for the Festival. The number of women on the juries has doubled in the last five years, from 21% in 2012. Terry Savage, Chairman of Cannes Lions, said „Our juries are developed in consultation with the industry and the progress we’ve achieved so far by working together is transforming the jury gender mix. We know the work doesn’t stop at gender and we look forward to working with the industry to tackle other representation issues.” Madonna Badger, CCO/Founder, Badger and Winters and Cannes Lions’ See it Be it Ambassador, commented „Cannes Lions’ commitment to diversity and equality shines a light for the entire industry. Whereas only 11% of Creative Directors are women, Cannes has increased the number of women on juries to 43% this year. The more the juries represent the ratio of men and women in the world, the better the awarded work will be.” Jose Papa, Managing Director of Cannes Lions, added „The job of the jury is to identify and award the very best in global creativity, recognising and celebrating work made by all people from all corners of the world. The make-up of this year’s juries marks another step forward in the Festival’s mission to improve diversity among its judges, and is something we’re committed to continuing in 2018 and beyond.” The 2017 juries are announced as: Cyber Jury President – Colleen DeCourcy, Global Chief Creative Officer, Wieden+Kennedy, Global Pablo Tajer, VP, Head of Digital Platforms, Grey, Argentina Andy Flemming, Group Creative Director, M&C Saatchi, Australia Katrien Bottez, Executive Creative Director, FamousGrey, Belgium Sergio Gordilho, Co-President & Chief Creative Officer, Africa, Brazil Jordan Doucette, Chief Creative Officer, Taxi Canada Ltd., Canada Benjamin Dessagne, Senior Copywriter, Buzzman, France Timm Weber, Chief Creative Officer, Publicis Pixelpark, Germany Eric Weisberg, Global Chief Creative Officer, Doner, Global Ritu Sharda, Senior Executive Creative Director, BBDO, India Sotaro Yasumochi, Creative Director, Dentsu Inc., Japan Gabriel Vazquez, Vice President Creative, J.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 5 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Cold, Cough and Sore Throat Remedies Market expected to grow at a CAGR of 3.2% during 2016-2026 Seeking professional medical help for curing cold, cough or sore throat is become a rare practice, let alone getting admitted in a hospital. Prevalence of cold, cough & sore throat problems through the ages has made people more independent in terms of treating them. In the years to come, effective home remedies will continue to gain traction and people will be taking care of their cold or sore throat through such easy-to-treat remedies. Future Market Insights’ latest report delivers such discernments that are expected to leave a considerable imprint on the global market for cold, cough & sore throat remedies. Based on the report, the global cold, cough & sore throat remedies market is presently valued at US$ 32.4 Bn, and is anticipated to incur sluggish growth at 3.2% CAGR to bring in just over US$ 45.4 Bn by the end of 2026. The report distinctly indicates that rising adoption of self-medication practices and effective home remedies is restraining the market’s overall growth. Request For Sample@ www.futuremarketinsights.com/reports/sample/rep-gb-1292 In the report, titled “Cold, Cough and Sore Throat Remedies Market: Global Industry Analysis and Opportunity Assessment, 2016-2026,” affordability of OTC drugs, rising economic burden of respiratory diseases, availability of medications in variable dosages, and fast & instant relief delivered through such cold, cough & sore throat remedies are driving the market’s growth. Nevertheless, the demand for cold, cough & sore throat remedies is less likely to soar at a healthy rate. Product Recalls & Low Entry of New Players Impacting the Market’s Growth Firstly, the global cold, cough & sore throat remedies market is projected to witness umpteen product recalls. Global leaders in pharmaceuticals industry such as Novartis AG, Pfizer Inc., Bayer AG, GlaxoSmithKline plc., and Reckitt Benckiser Group plc are key players in the global market for cold, cough & sore throat remedies. Despite, there are several newly-launched products that have been recalled after FDA’s censure. Besides, even consumer goods behemoths such as Procter & Gamble Co. and Johnson & Johnson Services Inc. are partaking in the market’s growth. This has resulted in a lowering entry of emerging drugmakers, which has further distorted the market’s growth. Other leading manufacturers of cold, cough & sore throat remedies include AstraZeneca plc, Prestige Brands Inc., and Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. Send An Enquiry@ www.futuremarketinsights.com/askus/rep-gb-1292 The report highlights how Asia-Pacific excluding Japan (APEJ) region will remain the largest market for cold, cough & sore throat remedies. The region’s proximity to environmental pollution makes its residents more prone to respiratory diseases. With over 30% stake in global revenues, the APEJ cold, cough & sore throat remedies market will global dominate through 2026. North America and Europe will also remain at the forefront, by collectively accounting for nearly half of the global revenues throughout the forecast period. The report further reveals that in 2017 and beyond, the demand for antihistamine drugs, expectorants and decongestants will remain considerably high as these revenues from sales of these drugs will showcase growth at more than 3% CAGR. Tablets or pills and nasal drops will also dominate as dosage types, accounting for over 40% share of market value through 2026. The report also predicts retail pharmacies & drug stores as the largest distribution channels for cold, cough & sore throat remedies. Together, these channels will bring in nearly US$ 30 Bn by the end of 2026. ABOUT US: Future Market Insights (FMI) is a leading market intelligence and consulting firm.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 5 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Adult Diapers Market – Global Industry Analysis Trends and Forecast by 2023 Global Adult Diapers Market: Overview Over 19 million people in the U.S. have some form of incontinence or other, and almost 85% of them are women. Incontinence is a common condition, which can treated by suitable medication or surgery in some special cases. However, those unwilling to undergo intrusive procedures have the option of choosing adult incontinence products. An adult diaper can be classified as incontinence care products and those meant to be worn if suffering from severe diarrhea, incontinence, mobility impairment, or dementia. The growing aging population, urbanization, greater affordability, and improved awareness are the chief factors driving the global adult diapers market. Obtain Report Details @ www.transparencymarketresearch.com/adult-diapers-market.html By product, the global adult diapers market can be segmented in terms of product, application, and geography. By product, the market constitute reusable and disposable adult diapers. The market can be further classified into pad type diapers, pant type diapers, and flat type diapers. The report provides a detailed analysis of the various factors supporting the market’s growth across the aforementioned segments. It also lists the restraints that could inhibit the market’s expansion. It compiles exhaustive information sourced through proven research mythologies to help stakeholders get a better perspective of the global adult diapers market. Global Adult Diapers Market: Trends and Opportunities Slow growth in personal income, lingering unemployment, and high cost of living have continued to weigh on the spending habits of consumers and their decisions to expand families. As per information shared by the Census Bureau, the retiring baby boomers have resulted in the surge of geriatric population (65 years of age and older) in the U.S., which is expected to nearly double itself from that in 2012 and reach nearly 83.7 million in 2050. The rapidly growing aging population, improvement in the healthcare system, and economic affluence are the chief factors driving the global adult diapers market. The geriatric care takers and parents are commonly educated and trained through media regarding the importance of hygiene when using baby or adult diapers. Some of the branded manufacturers are consciously focusing on creating awareness regarding the same, which is projected to have a positive influence on the market. For more information on this report, fill the form @ www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag… Despite the favorable opportunities, lack of awareness and social stigma often attached with incontinence especially in underdeveloped economies are hindering the growth of the market. Nevertheless, with efforts by governments and big brands to eradicate such social stigma, in future the market will witness considerable growth for raking in higher profit. Global Adult Diapers Market: Regional Outlook Regionally, the global adult diapers market can be segmented into North America, Asia Pacific, Europe, Latin America, MENA, and Rest of the World. As China, trailed by India, has the largest population of aged people, these countries are also expected to demonstrate the fastest growth in terms of the demand for adult diapers through the course of the forecast period.

Incontinence is a common condition, which can treated by suitable medication or surgery in some special cases. However, those unwilling to undergo intrusive procedures have the option of choosing adult incontinence products. An adult diaper can be classified as incontinence care products and those meant to be worn if suffering from severe diarrhea, incontinence, mobility impairment, or dementia. The growing aging population, urbanization, greater affordability, and improved awareness are the chief factors driving the global adult diapers market. Obtain Report Details @ www.transparencymarketresearch.com/adult-diapers-market.html By product, the global adult diapers market can be segmented in terms of product, application, and geography. By product, the market constitute reusable and disposable adult diapers. The market can be further classified into pad type diapers, pant type diapers, and flat type diapers. The report provides a detailed analysis of the various factors supporting the market’s growth across the aforementioned segments. It also lists the restraints that could inhibit the market’s expansion. It compiles exhaustive information sourced through proven research mythologies to help stakeholders get a better perspective of the global adult diapers market. Global Adult Diapers Market: Trends and Opportunities Slow growth in personal income, lingering unemployment, and high cost of living have continued to weigh on the spending habits of consumers and their decisions to expand families. As per information shared by the Census Bureau, the retiring baby boomers have resulted in the surge of geriatric population (65 years of age and older) in the U.S., which is expected to nearly double itself from that in 2012 and reach nearly 83.7 million in 2050. The rapidly growing aging population, improvement in the healthcare system, and economic affluence are the chief factors driving the global adult diapers market. The geriatric care takers and parents are commonly educated and trained through media regarding the importance of hygiene when using baby or adult diapers. Some of the branded manufacturers are consciously focusing on creating awareness regarding the same, which is projected to have a positive influence on the market. For more information on this report, fill the form @ www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag… Despite the favorable opportunities, lack of awareness and social stigma often attached with incontinence especially in underdeveloped economies are hindering the growth of the market. Nevertheless, with efforts by governments and big brands to eradicate such social stigma, in future the market will witness considerable growth for raking in higher profit. Global Adult Diapers Market: Regional Outlook Regionally, the global adult diapers market can be segmented into North America, Asia Pacific, Europe, Latin America, MENA, and Rest of the World. As China, trailed by India, has the largest population of aged people, these countries are also expected to demonstrate the fastest growth in terms of the demand for adult diapers through the course of the forecast period. Market trends suggest, a majority of new entrants will focus on expanding their business in emerging economies to capitalize on the opportunities prevalent therein.

Business Standard Warren Buffett revalues IBM downward IT major's shares slide after reports of billionaire's stake sale Jing Cao & Noah Buhayar  May 6, 2017 Last Updated at 00:26 IST email this article Message: Recipients' Email: Type address separated by commas Your Email: Enter the characters shown in the image. Send me a copy:   http://mybs.in/2UVetXd ALSO READ Warren Buffett's offer: $1 million per year for the rest of your life! Buffett back in money on IBM That $56 bn was here somewhere: Berkshire revises cash stake disclosure AIG to pay Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway about $10 bn in insurance deal Warren Buffett's Berkshire makes surprise US airline bet Warren Buffett gave Berkshire Hathaway investors something to talk about at the company’s annual meeting this weekend: He sold about a third of Berkshire’s investment in computer-services giant IBM.   Berkshire reduced the stake during the first and second quarters, CNBC reported Thursday, citing Buffett. The billionaire chairman and chief executive officer of Berkshire said he has since stopped selling, according to the broadcaster. Before the sales, Berkshire held about 81 million shares. The disclosure led IBM to tumble 3.8 per cent to $153.05 in premarket trading Friday. Berkshire started building its International Business Machines stake in 2011, eventually becoming the company’s largest shareholder, with an investment valued at almost $13 billion. IBM’s shares gained about 21 percent in 2016 after a run of three straight annual declines, and are still more than 25 per cent lower than the company’s 10-year peak in 2013. The shares have lagged behind both technology peers and the S&P 500 Index in 2017.   “This may put some pressure on management to be more aggressive in returning to growth,” Anurag Rana, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst, said in an email. Other investors “may get impatient.”   Thousands of Berkshire investors will gather in Omaha, Nebraska, for Berkshire’s annual meeting on Saturday. Buffett, 86, and Vice Chairman Charles Munger, who regularly field questions from shareholders at the event, can expect to be quizzed about IBM — as they have been in the past.   “I don’t value IBM the same way that I did six years ago when I started buying,” Buffett told CNBC. “I’ve revalued it somewhat downward.”   Representatives of Berkshire and IBM didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment after regular business hours.   While Buffett is known for sticking with stocks like Coca-Cola for decades, he’s not wedded to old favorites when circumstances change. In recent years, he got rid of most of Berkshire’s stock in Procter & Gamble and Walmart Stores. He cited the competition facing Walmart from online rivals like Amazon.com, while pointing in 2012 to disappointing results at P&G.   The billionaire also exited most of its stake in Graham Holdings, after that company sold the Washington Post newspaper.  Read More On Warren Buffett | Berkshire Hathaway | Anurag Rana | Ibm | International | Companies PREVIOUS STORY NEXT STORY RECOMMENDED FOR YOU Advertisements Cover from Natural Calamities.
