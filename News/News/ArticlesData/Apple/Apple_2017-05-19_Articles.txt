Between the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 recall and an epidemic of exploding hoverboards, people are more aware than ever that things with batteries go up in flames occasionally. So for Apple, being associated with any fire is a bad thing. In the case of a woman whose Beats heaphones exploded on a plane, Apple is going to pains to point out that it’s not Apple’s fault. Don't Miss: You won’t have to wait until November to buy Apple’s next-gen iPhone 8 As the Australian Associated Press reports, a woman from Adelaide was on a flight from Beijing to Melbourne earlier this year when her Beats headphones exploded. She was napping on the flight, but was awoken “by the sound of an explosion and a burning sensation on her face.” That model of Beats headphones reportedly used AAA battery cells, which are not supplied with the headphones. Apple claims that its investigation shows the third-party batteries were at fault, but the woman who was burned alleges that since there were no instructions on what brand of battery to use, Apple should bear some responsibility. “The headphones don’t work without batteries, yet nowhere on the headphones – or their packaging – did it specify which brand of batteries should be used,” she told the AP. With no more information, it’s difficult to second-guess Apple’s position here. But more important than apportioning blame for this specific incident is how hard Apple appears to be pushing back. In this kind of situation, it’s more common for a company to express regret, and maybe come to some kind of quiet settlement. But with exploding batteries such a big deal these days, Apple doesn’t even want the appearance of a mistake.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple The smaller iPad Pro should be coming next month Chris Smith BGR News May 20, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share Apple is planning to launch a third iPad Pro size shortly, and more reports indicate the 10.5-inch model will arrive at WWDC 2017 next month. Apple is expected to introduce a variety of gadgets at the developers show, including the 10.5-inch iPad Pro but also new laptops and a Siri speaker that would compete against Amazon Echo and Google Home. A new story out of Asia seems to indicate the resized iPad Pro might really be in the cards for a June launch, as Apple is ramping up production. Don't Miss: Tim Cook spotted with a blood-monitoring Apple Watch prototype According to Digitimes’ supply chain sources, Apple has been ramping up production for the 10.5-inch iPad Pro. The monthly shipment volume is expected to grow to 600,000 units in July, up from the current 500,000 units mark. Apple started mass-producing the new tablet in March or April. Apple is expected to ship between 5 million and 6 million 10.5-inch iPad Pro tablets this year. Worldwide tablet shipments were at 8.74 million in the March quarter, and the 10.5-inch iPad Pro could help drive demand for tablets this quarter, with overall tablet shipments tipped to reach 8.9 million units. The report notes that Apple’s newly launched 9.7-inch iPad is becoming more popular with buyers with demand expected to pick up strongly towards the end of the second quarter. Apple is expected to ship over four million units per month in June and July. Digitimes also notes that sources from the supply chain reported that Apple’s new iPad will accelerate Apple’s plans to phase out the iPad mini 4. BGR exclusively reported a few days ago that Apple plans to discontinue its smallest tablet. A 12.9-inch iPad Pro refresh is also in the cards for this year, although it’s not clear when it’ll hit production. Apple is expected to launch it at some point in the third quarter.

After the excitement of Microsoft’s Build 2017 developer conference last week, there was barely time to catch our breaths before the buzz of Google’s I/O dev event this week. There were all sorts of announcements from I/O this week, and no shortage of other news from elsewhere in the tech world too. Don’t worry about having missed anything though, for 7 Days is here once more to walk you through the week’s top tech news. Our journey across the tech world begins this week with Netflix, which is now blocking installations of its app on Android devices that have been rooted. Meanwhile, the entertainment giant introduced new Dolby Vision content support for LG's Android flagship, the G6. It's been a busy few days for Netflix; last weekend, it temporarily increased all of its prices in Australia to gauge reactions from consumers - and predictably, they reacted with confusion and outrage. But in happier news, Netflix is also adapting popular gaming and book series The Witcher as a TV show - good news for fans of the franchise! Messaging app Telegram has been busy too. Earlier in the week, it updated its desktop app on Windows, Mac and Linux, adding support for voice calls. A few days later, it released a major update for its mobile app on iOS and Android, adding multiple new features, including video messages, and bot payment support. On Wednesday, chipmaker AMD announced its new line of powerful desktop-class 'Threadripper' CPUs, with 16 cores and 32 threads. Nvidia launched its affordable new GeForce GT 1030 graphics cards. Designed primarily for e-sports gamers, the new GPUs are priced as low as $69.99 with 2GB GDDR5 video memory. Another one bites the dust: ExtraTorrent, the world's second largest torrent indexing site, became the latest to permanently shut down. Amazon refreshed its line-up of tablets, running its Android-forked Fire OS. The updated range includes a tweaked Fire 7 tablet, a lower price for the Fire HD 8, and a new Fire HD 8 Kids Edition. Many of the week's biggest announcements came from the Google I/O developer conference in Mountain View, California, where the company revealed that Android is now installed on over 2 billion monthly active phones and tablets, in addition to the many other devices that run its Android OS. Google also released Android Studio 3.0 Canary 1, an early preview of the next version of its integrated development environment, bringing a wide variety of new features and enhancements. And after beginning live testing in January of Android Instant Apps - which allows users to run apps without installing them on their devices - Google announced that it has now opened up that functionality to all developers. Google revealed several new features and updates for its Play Console too, allowing developers to improve their app performance and marketing techniques, while helping them to maximize their reach. Security issues remain a concern for many Android users - but Google is hoping to reassure them with Google Play Protect, its "more visible and accessible" security tools on Android devices. It's also renamed its Android Device Manager as 'Find My Device', as part of the Google Play Protect suite. Google launched its Android O Beta Program on Wednesday - but only for a handful of supported devices. Android O is the current moniker - which will eventually be replaced with a more delicious designation - for the next major version of the OS. The company said that Android O will bring big improvements in boot time, app performance, and device battery life. In addition to those benefits, Android O will also usher in Android Go, a new edition of the OS designed for low-cost, lower-end devices with modest specs. Android Go - and all first-party apps that run on it - will be optimized to run on handsets with as little as 512MB of RAM. While Google is focusing on the next version of Android, many devices still haven't received its last major update. Android 7.0 Nougat continued to slowly make its way to more handsets this week: Unlocked LG G5 in the United States HTC One M9 on AT&T Samsung Galaxy A5 (2016) and Galaxy A7 (2016) in India Samsung is pushing ahead with its efforts to sell refurbished models of its failed Galaxy Note7 flagship, which was globally recalled following a series of battery fires last year. The device is expected to be made available again under a new name: the Galaxy Note FE. On Tuesday, HTC unveiled its new flagship phone, just two months after its last flagship went on sale. The U 11's key selling point is the ability to 'squeeze' it to activate apps and features, through sensors embedded in the sides of the device. That could prove to be little more than a silly gimmick, but the $649 handset still has plenty to offer, including the latest Snapdragon 835 processor, 4GB RAM, 64GB storage, and IP67 dust- and water-resistance. Oddly, less than 24 hours after its announcement, HTC began offering $50 off the U 11's price. Lenovo unveiled two new devices at the other end of the smartphone market. The Moto C and Moto C Plus are low-cost devices with some decent specs, including a whopping 4000mAh battery on the larger Plus model. An image also leaked of Lenovo's new high-end Moto Z2 handset. Lenovo revealed several Windows 10 devices too, including new IdeaPad notebooks, the Flex 5 convertible, and a new Legion-branded gaming laptop, which packs an Intel K-series processor. Lenovo and HTC were officially revealed as the two launch manufacturers for new untethered, standalone virtual reality headsets for Google's Daydream VR platform. Qualcomm is also working with Google to produce a reference design for other manufacturers to base their headsets on. Google is boosting its image recognition capabilities through a new tool harnessing its Knowledge Graph, known as Google Lens. And Google also revealed that its digital Assistant is now available on over 100 million devices. That number is set to increase, as Google announced that its Assistant is now available on iPhones - but only in the United States, for now. iPhone, iPad and iPod touch users can now get the new Microsoft Planner app on their devices. Planner originally launched for Office 365 last year, and is coming to Android and Windows 10 devices too. Microsoft updated its Sway app for iOS too, with improved navigation, better preview support, and more. Apple is reportedly planning to phase out the iPad mini, as it's no longer considered to offer sufficient differentiation between the largest iPhone and the smallest 'full-size' iPad. Rumors also suggest that Apple will soon announce a new iPad with a 10.5-inch display squeezed into the same form factor as the 9.7-inch model, thanks to much slimmer bezels. The new iPad is expected to be announced at Apple's Worldwide Developer Conference next month - and that's not all. Apple will reportedly refresh its entire MacBook range, also debuting the new models at WWDC in June. On Monday, Apple released iOS 10.3.2, macOS 10.12.5 Sierra, watchOS 3.2.2, and tvOS 10.2.1 to all users, bringing a range of security updates, bug fixes, and stability improvements. A day later, it rolled out the first Developer Beta builds of iOS 10.3.3, macOS 10.12.6, watchOS 3.2.3, and tvOS 10.2.2. As part of its macOS 10.12.5 update, Apple added new support for the recently-released Windows 10 Creators Update to Boot Camp. macOS 10.12.5 finally introduces support for 'media-free installation' of the Creators Update. Last week, a massive ransomware attack struck dozens of countries across the globe, causing chaos for consumers, companies, and other organizations, including the UK's National Health Service. Many NHS centers and hospitals were locked out of patients' records as a result of the attack, and some treatments and operations even had to be postponed or cancelled. Over the past week, the situation has developed further: Microsoft patches Windows 8, XP, and Server 2003 to combat 'WannaCry' ransomware attack Report indicates almost all WannaCry victims were on Windows 7; Windows XP user count said to be 'insignificant' Hundreds of thousands of PCs affected in China WannaCry decryption tools released, but it's not good news for everyone Speculation of North Korean link to WannaCry Hacker group that published WannaCry exploit threatens release of more tools in June Earlier this week, Microsoft President Brad Smith said that 'stockpiling' of hacking tools by governments was partly to blame for the WannaCry attack. Meanwhile, the US Department of Defense said that it expects its migration to Windows 10 to be completed by the end of this year. The DoD originally announced it plans to upgrade 4 million devices to Windows 10 in February 2016, and - somewhat ambitiously - said that it would be completed within twelve months of that announcement, but those plans are clearly running behind schedule. On Wednesday, Microsoft rolled out Windows 10 Insider Preview build 16199 to the Fast ring. The new preview is the latest from the Redstone 3 development branch, which will eventually be released as the Fall Creators Update, and brings several new features and other improvements to the OS. As always, the new build also includes various bug fixes, and some known issues to be aware of. In its announcement of build 16199, Microsoft inadvertently included an image - which it later deleted - that showed a previously-unseen Settings icon on the taskbar. It later emerged that that icon is the toggle for a new Windows 10 'Control Center', which will be the new home for the Quick Action buttons that are currently located in the Action Center. Microsoft also announced a range of new and improved accessibility features coming to Windows 10 in the Fall Creators Update, including enhanced braille support, new filters for color-blind users, new Magnifier features, Learning Tools in the Edge browser, and more. And in another important announcement, Microsoft revealed that customers who purchase a Windows 10 S device, and who require assistive technologies to use their PCs, will be entitled to a free upgrade to Windows 10 Pro. That upgrade will enable them to install apps not available from the Windows Store - a feature that isn't available in the new Windows 10 S edition. Microsoft also released a new Windows 10 Mobile Insider Preview, build 15215, which-- --HUH. Sorry about that. ...a new Windows 10 Mobile build which brings some utterly thrilling fixes for a handful of issues. Microsoft barely mentioned Windows phones at its Build 2017 dev conference, and after the company split development of Windows 10 Mobile away from the main Windows 10 development branch - for the first time since it launched in 2015 - it raised some serious questions about its commitment to its mobile operating system. Microsoft's Joe Belfiore said this week: "We're going to continue to support Windows phone." But the level of its support for Windows phones remains frustratingly unclear. Windows 10 Mobile is now officially supported on just 13 handsets, and with so few users, there appears to be little incentive for Microsoft to pour resources into developing major new features for it. While some previously-promised features are likely to arrive as part of the Fall Creators Update - albeit under the splintered 'feature2' development branch - 'the company's longer-term 'support' for the OS remains in doubt. Just a few days after Belfiore made that comment, Microsoft removed half of the Windows phones listed on its Store in the US, leaving just seven devices available to purchase. A sad, but telling, sign of the level of public support for Windows 10 Mobile came on Tuesday, when WhartonBrooks' new Windows phone, the Cerulean Moment, failed to meet its crowdfunding campaign to help launch the device. WhartonBrooks said that the device was designed "for the fans", and its campaign aimed to raise $1.1 million, but ended with just $29,793, or 3% of its target. Next week, Microsoft will be hosting an event in Shanghai, China, where it's promised to "show the world what's next". But the surprise was apparently ruined on Thursday, when images of the company's new Windows 10 device were leaked. Microsoft had been widely expected to unveil its new Surface Pro 5 at the event, and rumors suggested that it would be a fairly modest evolution of its predecessor. But the leaked pictures show a device that's virtually identical to the current model. The new device will reportedly be known simply as the 'Surface Pro', and despite its similarity to the Pro 4, it will have some upgraded specs, including Intel's latest Kaby Lake processors. Microsoft added fifteen new companies to the list of those who can sell its Surface Hub in the UK, following "huge demand" for the touchscreen collaboration device among British organizations. Microsoft also launched its free Rewards program in the UK, offering members the ability to collect points from store purchases, Bing web searches, and surfing the web with its Edge browser, in exchange for freebies. As in recent years, Microsoft is following up on its recent Build 2017 dev conference with a series of two-day developer events in India, China, Poland, and four other countries, where it will offer demos, hackathons, and the opportunity to try out HoloLens and Mixed Reality devices. A listing on the Windows Store indicated that, along with Spotify and iTunes, the WhatsApp desktop client is also coming to the Store. However, users of the Yahoo Mail app on Windows 10 have received notifications informing them that the app "will stop working after May 22", and directing them to check their email instead "in any web browser". On Thursday, Microsoft announced a major redesign for its OneNote app across all platforms. The new look had already rolled out to iOS earlier in the week. This summer, Microsoft will introduce a new file sharing experience for OneDrive. The company also highlighted new features that will be making their way to Office 365 customers utilizing SharePoint. On Friday, Microsoft quietly added support for Expiring Links to OneDrive for users with an Office 365 subscription. The feature - which allows users to set an expiration time for any shared link - was previously available in OneDrive for Business. Microsoft launched new features for its Bing search engine, including bots on the search page, e-sports coverage, and search optimizations for hiking and camping locations. On Tuesday, Microsoft released its latest update, Version 1705, for the Xbox One and Xbox One S, including new Arena features, Party Overlay updates, and more. Microsoft is offering up to 75% off Backward Compatible Xbox 360 games playable on the Xbox One in its Super Sale, which is due to end on May 22. And until May 21, Microsoft is additionally offering free multiplayer gaming for all Xbox Live members - a perk usually limited to Xbox Live Gold subscribers. On top of that, it's also allowing Xbox One owners to play Minecraft for free this weekend. Phantom Dust, the classic Xbox game from 2005, is now available on Xbox One and Windows 10 as an Xbox Play Anywhere title with a range of improvements - and it's totally free. South Park: The Fractured But Whole was originally due to launch on Xbox One, PS4 and PC on December 6, before it was postponed until Q1 2017, and then delayed again earlier this year. But the new game is due to finally launch on October 17. The first gameplay footage of Destiny 2 was revealed this week - but its developers also announced that the PC version will be exclusive to Battle.net. If you were hoping to get a glimpse of Halo 6 at the E3 gaming expo, prepare for disappointment. Microsoft's 343 Industries said that it won't reveal the next game in the franchise there, but added that it will "have a little something at E3" for Halo fans... Nintendo's new Switch console has been a stunning success since it launched in March, and it hasn't lost its momentum yet. In fact, it was the top-selling console in the United States last month. Half-Life fans: rejoice! No, it's not the long-awaited (and totally imaginary) Half-Life 3, but for Oculus Rift and HTC Vive owners, its the next best thing. A modding project is working to bring support for Half-Life 2 to the two virtual reality headsets. Look out for those headcrabs! Our journey this week is nearing its end, but before we reach our final destination, I wanted to share this with you: a developer has created a working hologram concept for Cortana, using the Windows 10 version of the digital assistant, and custom animations developed through Kinect motion capture. I don't know about you, but I love seeing what imaginative and skilled developers can do with their passion and determination, and I think this is just awesome. But our odyssey across the tech world approaches its final destination in the hands of Air New Zealand, which is testing Microsoft's HoloLens headset with custom software that displays information about passengers, including drinks preferences, travel itineraries, food allergies, and even their emotional state. There's no denying that the headset looks a bit... out of place on the flight attendant in the video that the airline released, but I think it's fascinating to see how companies are exploring the use of mixed reality to potentially transform the ways that they do business. For now, I'm heading off to the arrivals lounge for a Bloody Mary - but please sit back, relax, and enjoy some of this week's bonus content below... Bonus content Before we wrap things up for another week, let me first highlight a few extra bits around the site that I hope you’ll enjoy reading. Christopher White published his detailed review of the sleek Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon X1. The premium Windows 10 Ultrabook has a superb keyboard (as you'd expect from the ThinkPad line), along with top-notch battery life, and an impressive fingerprint sensor. It's not quite perfect though... Rich Woods went hands-on at Build 2017 with the Kodisoft IRT Table, an interactive table designed for restaurants (!), running Windows 10. Check out Rich's video - it's definitely worth a watch! I got my paws on the new Windows 10 wearable device from TrekStor. Manufactured by Askey, the device runs Windows 10 IoT Core, and is designed for business scenarios, which is why it's not exactly a looker. Get more info on the device here, including a gallery and a video of the interface. And finally, Rich and I toured the Hub at Build 2017 visiting some of Microsoft's stands and those of its partners - check out our video from the show floor here... and be sure to let Rich know just how cool those Skype sunglasses really are! Stay tuned to Neowin in the days ahead for what’s sure to be another exciting week, filled with official news, lots of updates, and plenty of insights from around the world of technology. For now, though, there’s lots more to read across the site – including all sorts of interesting discussions over on our forums. From all of us on the Neowin team, have a great weekend!

AfterDawn > News > Next Apple Watch to have a new type of health sensor? Next Apple Watch to have a new type of health sensor? Written by Matti Vähäkainu (Google+) @ 19 May 2017 19:29 Many Apple fans are probably already waiting for the upcoming iPhones that will be introduces in early September, if previous years are any indication. However, Apple has a lot more in store in terms of services and products. Apple Watch hasn't been as relevant in recent history as it was when it first launched but the company is working on a major update. CEO Tim Cook has been seen wearing a new type of sensor added to a Apple Watch, CNBC reports. Ever since unveiling the first Apple Watch with a heart rate sensor, the Cupertino giant has been more interested in health applications in both software and hardware. The upcoming new version could bring an even more important health related sensor. The sensor is said to monitor glucose levels continuously without invasive measures. This "holy grail" of blood sugar tracking would be a huge help to people suffering from diabetes. Because the measurements are not necessary for the larger population it might be an external accessory. Apple hasn't usually released new Apple Watches in its developer conference in June and it is unlikely this years WWDC is any different but with an update to watchOS we might get some indication if Apple is indeed going to add this function to their smartwatches.

The Australian woman, who asked not to be identified, was traveling from Beijing to Melbourne, Australia when she woke up two hours into the flight to the sound of her headphones exploding and a burning sensation. The woman’s face, hands and hair were burned during the incident. She was looking to get reimbursement for her headphones and ruined clothing, but Apple said the incident was not due to product defects. "Our investigation indicated the issue was caused by a third-party battery," the Cupertino company said in a statement shared by the woman's lawyers. The woman said she bought the batteries in Australia. "The headphones don't work without batteries, yet nowhere on the headphones - or their packaging - did it specify which brand of batteries should be used," she said. The battery and cover of the headphones were melted and stuck on the floor of the airplane. “I continued to feel burning so I grabbed them off and threw them on the floor. They were sparking and had small amounts of fire," the woman said back in February. "As I went to stamp my foot on them the flight attendants were already there with a bucket of water to pour on them. They put them into the bucket at the rear of the plane.” The incident sparked chaos among passengers traveling on the aircraft. The smell of melted plastic, burnt electronics and burnt hair filled the airplane, with people “coughing and choking the entire way home.” After the incident, the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) reminded travelers of safety precautions when using battery-powered devices. The Bureau recommended: - Batteries should be kept in an approved stowage, unless in use - Spare batteries must be in your carry-on baggage NOT checked baggage - If a passenger’s smartphone or other device has fallen into the seat gap, locate their device before moving powered seat. - If a passenger cannot locate their device, they should refrain from moving their seat and immediately contact a cabin crew member. Apple’s blame on third-party batteries comes after Samsung Galaxy Note 7 devices were globally recalled last year after the phones were found to cause battery fires. The Galaxy Note 7 failure cost Samsung $5.3 billion in operating profit. In October 2016, a Galaxy Note 7 replacement burst into flames on a Southwest Airlines flight. After the incident, the devices were banned from all U.S. aircrafts by the U.S. Department of Transportation, with the Federal Aviation Administration and the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration. Regulators said passengers with the Note 7 would be denied boarding a flight, and could face fines and even criminal prosecution if they were found to have violated the ban.

Click to Skip Ad Closing in... Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Accessories Apple claims exploding Beats headphones ‘not our fault’ Chris Mills @chrisfmills May 19th, 2017 at 10:02 PM Share Tweet Exploding electronics are a, uh, hot topic lately. Between the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 recall and an epidemic of exploding hoverboards, people are more aware than ever that things with batteries go up in flames occasionally. So for Apple, being associated with any fire is a bad thing. In the case of a woman whose Beats heaphones exploded on a plane, Apple is going to pains to point out that it’s not Apple’s fault. Don't Miss: You won’t have to wait until November to buy Apple’s next-gen iPhone 8 As the Australian Associated Press reports, a woman from Adelaide was on a flight from Beijing to Melbourne earlier this year when her Beats headphones exploded. She was napping on the flight, but was awoken “by the sound of an explosion and a burning sensation on her face.” That model of Beats headphones reportedly used AAA battery cells, which are not supplied with the headphones. Apple claims that its investigation shows the third-party batteries were at fault, but the woman who was burned alleges that since there were no instructions on what brand of battery to use, Apple should bear some responsibility. “The headphones don’t work without batteries, yet nowhere on the headphones – or their packaging – did it specify which brand of batteries should be used,” she told the AP. With no more information, it’s difficult to second-guess Apple’s position here. But more important than apportioning blame for this specific incident is how hard Apple appears to be pushing back. In this kind of situation, it’s more common for a company to express regret, and maybe come to some kind of quiet settlement. But with exploding batteries such a big deal these days, Apple doesn’t even want the appearance of a mistake.

 Why Apple wants to outlaw people from fixing their own iPhones Neel V. Patel, Inverse May 19, 2017, 8:44 PM 7,440 facebook linkedin twitter email print Shutterstock A broken smartphone is like a broken limb. Suddenly, something you rely on every day is a hobbled version of its former self, and the convenience and ease with how you got through life before it takes a severe step back. Naturally, capitalism ensures that those who stand to gain the most from making smartphone repairs prevent any competition. Enter Apple: the tech giant is currently lobbying against a New York state bill that would compel electronics companies to make available information that would make it easier for customers and third-party repair businesses to fix broken smartphones. The bill is called the "Fair Repair Act." Its purpose reads that it will "require manufacturers who operate and sell in New York State to make available diagnostic and repair information for digital electronic parts and machines." That specifically means that Apple would be legally mandated to sell replacement parts and tools to the public, prohibit software locks that place limits on repairs, and require companies to make repair guides available to consumers. Apple, along with other companies like Verizon, Toyota, Johnson & Johnson, and several tech industry trade organizations, are all working together to oppose its passage in the New York state legislature. As Motherboard reports, Apple is likely opposing similar bills in as many as 11 other states, but New York’s lobbying disclosure laws mean it’s the first time the company is on the public record for its work in advocating against the Fair Repair Act. Apple has a pretty big financial incentive for lobbying against such laws. American consumers spent $4 billion on cell phone repairs in 2015 alone. The Cupertino, California-based tech behemoth makes a ton of money by getting customers who’ve just bought a new MacBook or iPhone to purchase AppleCare+ insurance, which incentivizes customers to get their devices fixed by authorized Apple professionals. It’s impossible to figure out exactly how much Apple makes off of repair services, but Apple Services did pull in $7.04 billion in sales last year. Even a fraction of that is a pretty hefty sum for the company to want to safeguard. Third-party repair shops or savvy customers who know what they’re doing will not necessarily buy premium repair parts from the device manufacturers themselves. A store down the block might use a much cheaper replacement screen for an iPhone instead of the much more expensive part Apple makes. Although those repairs are free under programs like AppleCare+, customers must still purchase them. In addition, Apple probably prefers other customers who aren’t covered to still come directly to them for paid repairs, instead of other vendors. Apple has provided a glimpse of its reasoning in a statement to the The Guardianlast year, when news broke of a DIY hack which replaced the Home button on an iPhone 6 and allowed the phone to be "bricked": "We protect fingerprint data using a secure enclave, which is uniquely paired to the Touch ID sensor. When iPhone is serviced by an authorized Apple service provider or Apple retail store for changes that affect the touch ID sensor, the pairing is re-validated. This check ensures the device and the iOS features related to touch ID remain secure. Without this unique pairing, a malicious touch ID sensor could be substituted, thereby gaining access to the secure enclave. When iOS detects that the pairing fails, touch ID, including Apple Pay, is disabled so the device remains secure." Records show the tech companies and trade organizations fighting against the "Fair Repair Act" have spent $366,634 so far this year. EXCLUSIVE FREE REPORT: 25 Big Tech Predictions by BI Intelligence.

The iPhone 5 is getting old and that puts the spotlight on each update Apple releases for the former flagship. Even maintenance releases like iOS 10.3.2. iOS updates for older devices can have a dramatic impact on performance. Sometimes they have a positive effect. Sometimes, unfortunately, it’s negative. Apple’s latest iPhone 5 update, iOS 10.3.2, is a bug fix update but those of you already on iOS 10.3.2 or thinking about downloading should be extremely careful. If you’re making the move to iOS 10.3.2 from the iOS 10.3.1 update, you probably won’t need to clear out a ton of space. If you’re coming to iOS 10.3.2 from something older than iOS 10.3, you can expect your update to be massive (several hundred MB) thanks to the features and fixes from iOS 10.3 and any other iOS updates you missed along the way. This device-specific roundup will take you through our impressions of the iPhone 5 iOS 10.3.2 update’s performance and it will guide you through some of the key things to keep in mind as we push toward Apple’s next iOS 10 release. We’ll continue to update this roundup with new details as we get them so keep an eye out for frequent changes. iPhone 5 iOS 10.3.2 Update: First Impressions   1 / 9 We upgraded from iOS 10.3.1 to iOS 10.3.2 so our download and installation only took about seven minutes total. We didn't run into any issues with the installation.  If you are coming to iOS 10.3.2 from iOS 10.2.1 or something older, your download/installation is going to take a few minutes longer.  We recommend putting aside 15-20 minutes of quiet time so that you can monitor the process. You shouldn't anticipate any problems but there's always a chance for a hiccup.  We've been using the iPhone 5 iOS 10.3.2 update for a full day and so far, the device is handling iOS 10.3.2. We're using the update on an AT&T iPhone model.  The iPhone 5's battery continues to work miracles. We haven't noticed any abnormal battery drain during our brief time with iOS 10.3.2. If you do notice weird battery drain, take a look at our list of tips. Chances are, it's not iOS 10.3.2 causing your problems. We've tested the iPhone 5 and its iOS 10.3.2 update with several different ISPs, routers and Bluetooth devices. We haven't noticed any major issues. AT&T's LTE and 4G networks are also behaving.  Random reboots were an issue for us on iOS 10.2 but we haven't noticed with iOS 10.3.2 on board. That could change but iOS 10.3.1 and iOS 10.3 were stable as well.  The iPhone 5 feels fast with iOS 10.3.2 on board. Animations and transitions are fluid and we haven't experienced any lag when opening up Control Center.  We also haven't noticed any lag when opening up and closing folders, something we saw on iOS 10.2.1. The movement is crisp. We have seen some clunkiness when opening up applications but it's not as bad as it was on iOS 10.2.1 and older versions of iOS 10.  The iPhone 5 iOS 10.3.2 feels stable on our device but you'll definitely want to take a cautious approach, particularly if you're having a good experience on whatever version of iOS you're on.  If you need some additional feedback, see our list of reasons to and not to install the iOS 10.3.2 update on your iPhone.   1 / 9 15 Responses 12/19/2016 Facebook lite apk Reply i like ios 10.2 more than 10.1. power berry slow lost 02/24/2017 Kent Reply After installing 10.2.1 on my iPhone 5s I started getting random reboots. At least 10 per day. If plugged into the charger, the reboots seemed to go away. 02/27/2017 Jarvis Reply Hi guys, I am using iPhone 5s with ios 9.3.3. I am getting reminders to update to whitetail 10.2.1 I’m not sure though, if I should go for an update or not since Internet is poisoned about 30% battery bug in ios 10. I’m new to iPhone, have almost no past experience of ios. As of now I am pretty satisfied with ios 9.3.3 just sometimes it becomes difficult to click on( x) while trying to close search box with some other minor hiccups, don’t know if it’s a software issue or hardware on my device. I’m kinda liking the health app. Although it is not measuring the floors climbed while it’s counting the steps taken. I am told it will count the floors climbed after I updated to 10.2.1 which kind of sounds weird. Please suggest me the right course of action. By the way what’s Jailbreak? Hoping to hear from you soon. 03/03/2017 Natasha Reply Updated to 10.2.1 yesterday and my phone wont start at all and has been at the Apple logo + loading bar screen for over 24 hours. :( 04/17/2017 Justice B.

Nice. 04/04/2017 Fendi Reply Cara donlowd bbm versi lama Dan perbaharui ios 7.1.2 ke ios 8.0 04/11/2017 ANNOYED Reply WARNING !!! do NOT update the latest software for iphone if you have an iphone 5. Update 10.3.1 will continually ask you for to enter your passcode whether you have ever had one or not. It will not restart without one. I contacted Apple eventually through their help web site and although helpful at first and promising to call me back if we got cut off while they spoke to higher authority for a solution. THEY DID NOT. They came back after the first referral saying they needed at least 30 mins or so for me to hold on. I did and got cut off. No follow up and now the help support site seems to have crashed and even blocked my job referral email link they sent me advising me to find an alternative solution!! The only solution offered was to reformat and clear my phone as it had to have a passcode to unlock it after the update. I have had my iphone 5 since they first came out and it has never been locked or had a passcode or a finger print (they kept repeating this question) used. Not sure what to do now so I will go into an APPLE store tomorrow and hopefully they can either have found a fix for this problem or restore my phone to 10.3 which was working fine! Obviously I do not want to loose all my data and more importantly my photos of my new granddaughter who visited the other week. I WILL NEVER DO ANOTHER UPDATE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! NOT HAPPY APPLE!!!!!!!!!! 04/20/2017 Kate Sukhanova Reply I have the same problem and the same attitude! I turned off the passcode several months ago but after an update a week ago my iphone 6 is requesting a passcode! I still remember the one and only passcode that was TURNED OFF some time ago and it doesn’t fit. The only way out for now is to restore the phone and to loose all data… That’s what two of my friends did in similar situation. I switched to my very old samsung for now still hoping that Apple will admit the issue and find the way out, but it is a very thin hope…. I even reported the bug on their site, but there is no answer, nothing. Apple has become a huge disappointment :((((( Do they care about their clients any longer? 04/18/2017 Rach Reply I just updated my iphone 5s (on 18th April 2017) and after about half an hour of working normally, the phone is completely dead. It will not charge. I think it’s stuffed! Built in obsolescence? 05/19/2017 Art Reply I have a i phone 5s that went dead after I took it off the charger toke it to my phone company because I have apple care they were willing to replace it took a few days to get new one. This happened not long after I had updated to 10,3,1. New phone didn’t last a week. This time I toke it to apple store where they replaced it again. New phone didn’t make 24 hours, back to apple store this time another tech again replaced my phone after conversation with tech he told me he had seen 5 or six 5s with this same problem in the last 2 weeks. After about a week this phone to packed it in by now I knew how to do a hard start so I got through the week as I don’t live near apple store. I might add this phone to seemed to crap out not long after I updated to 10,3,1. I/m 3 hours from apple store so I had to wait till last Saturday to get it replaced. Different tech again this time who didn’t want to replace it so we restarted it like it was a new phone, didn’t make 24 hours before it crapped out again. Put up with it for a week, now I’m PISSED!!!!!! SO back to the apple store again tomorrow. Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published. Comment Name* Email* Website

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Tablets Image Source: Jose Sanchez/AP/REX/Shutterstock The smaller iPad Pro should be coming next month Chris Smith @chris_writes May 19th, 2017 at 8:00 PM Share Tweet Apple is planning to launch a third iPad Pro size shortly, and more reports indicate the 10.5-inch model will arrive at WWDC 2017 next month. Apple is expected to introduce a variety of gadgets at the developers show, including the 10.5-inch iPad Pro but also new laptops and a Siri speaker that would compete against Amazon Echo and Google Home. A new story out of Asia seems to indicate the resized iPad Pro might really be in the cards for a June launch, as Apple is ramping up production. Don't Miss: Tim Cook spotted with a blood-monitoring Apple Watch prototype According to Digitimes’ supply chain sources, Apple has been ramping up production for the 10.5-inch iPad Pro. The monthly shipment volume is expected to grow to 600,000 units in July, up from the current 500,000 units mark. Apple started mass-producing the new tablet in March or April. Apple is expected to ship between 5 million and 6 million 10.5-inch iPad Pro tablets this year. Worldwide tablet shipments were at 8.74 million in the March quarter, and the 10.5-inch iPad Pro could help drive demand for tablets this quarter, with overall tablet shipments tipped to reach 8.9 million units. The report notes that Apple’s newly launched 9.7-inch iPad is becoming more popular with buyers with demand expected to pick up strongly towards the end of the second quarter. Apple is expected to ship over four million units per month in June and July. Digitimes also notes that sources from the supply chain reported that Apple’s new iPad will accelerate Apple’s plans to phase out the iPad mini 4. BGR exclusively reported a few days ago that Apple plans to discontinue its smallest tablet. A 12.9-inch iPad Pro refresh is also in the cards for this year, although it’s not clear when it’ll hit production. Apple is expected to launch it at some point in the third quarter.

(KXAN Photo) Related Coverage UT Austin robot could help stroke patients regain strength Stroke recovery aided by new technology in Austin Study finds a rise in strokes among young people AUSTIN (KXAN) — No warning and a stroke can strike. It happened to one Austin woman, whose only treatment is a stent that is not on the market yet. Heatherly McDaniel, 41, knew something was off the day she had a stroke in April last year. Her then 16-year-old daughter recognized the slurred speech and numbness on one side. “She looked at the situation and she said, ‘This is out of character for our mother,'” McDaniel said. “The only thing she could think of is it has to be a stroke.” Her family rushed her to the hospital, where emergency room doctors treated the stroke, caused by a blood clot. But less than two weeks later, her left leg suddenly started to swell. It was another massive clot nowhere near her heart or brain. McDaniel was young, healthy and had no recent surgeries, not the mold of a person prone to blood clots. “The problem that Heatherly had was right here,” said Dr. Jeff Apple, pointing to a large scan of McDaniel’s pelvic area. Apple is a vascular surgeon with Cardiothoracic and Vascular Surgeons in Austin. His scans discovered a massive blood clot near McDaniel’s legs, not the typical place clots usually form. A rare condition, called the May-Thurner syndrome, caused one of the major veins in her left leg, the Iliac vein, to be cut off, blocking McDaniel’s blood flow. “Her vein is like having one lane closed on Interstate 35,” Apple said, referring to one of Austin’s major, mostly congested highways. “When we put a stent in, we open it up to two lanes, traffic should move as fast and as normal as it should.” The new stent Dr. Apple used isn’t available yet. McDaniel was part of a clinical trial. Dr. Apple said most surgeons are still using stents created 20 years ago, and they are not designed for larger leg veins. And the types of clots caused by the May-Thurner strike young women, including her sister McDaniel’s younger sister. “The typical phone call we get is an 18, 22-year female who has recently started on birth control pills about six weeks ago and they get a huge left sided blood clot.” Apple said. So far, McDaniel said she has only had small side effects. “My leg tingles, my toes tingle and most of the times I can deal with it, ’cause that’s pretty minor compared to a few people I’ve met who have had strokes,” she said. Doctors say the next step now is to monitor patients for the next year to determine if the stent is safe for other patients. If McDaniel had not qualified for the trial, doctors would have treated her condition with life-long blood thinners and compression sleeves.

The Company posted quarterly revenue of $52.9 billion and quarterly earnings per diluted share of $2.10. These results compare to revenue of $50.6 billion and earnings per diluted share of $1.90 in the year-ago quarter. International sales accounted for 65 percent of the quarter’s revenue. “We are proud to report a strong March quarter, with revenue growth accelerating from the December quarter and continued robust demand for iPhone 7 Plus,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “We’ve seen great customer response to both models of the new iPhone 7 (PRODUCT)RED Special Edition and we’re thrilled with the strong momentum of our Services business, with our highest revenue ever for a 13-week quarter. Looking ahead, we are excited to welcome attendees from around the world to our annual Worldwide Developers Conference next month in San Jose.” Apple also announced that its Board of Directors has authorized an increase of $50 billion to the Company’s program to return capital to shareholders and is extending the program timeframe by four quarters.  Under the expanded program, Apple plans to spend a cumulative total of $300 billion by the end of March 2019. “We generated strong operating cash flow of $12.5 billion and returned over $10 billion to our investors in the March quarter,” said Luca Maestri, Apple’s CFO. “Given the strength of our business and our confidence in our future, we are happy to announce another $50 billion increase to our capital return program today.” As part of the latest update to the program, the Board has increased its share repurchase authorization to $210 billion from the $175 billion level announced a year ago. The Company also expects to continue to net-share-settle vesting restricted stock units. The Board has approved a 10.5% increase to the Company’s quarterly dividend, and has declared a dividend of $0.63 per share of the Company’s common stock, payable on May 18, 2017 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on May 15, 2017. From the inception of its capital return program in August 2012 through March 2017, Apple has returned over $211 billion to shareholders, including $151 billion in share repurchases. The Company plans to continue to access the domestic and international debt markets to assist in funding the program. The management team and the Board will continue to review each element of the capital return program regularly and plan to provide an update on the program on an annual basis. Apple is providing the following guidance for its fiscal 2017 third quarter:   revenue between $43.5 billion and $45.5 billion gross margin between 37.5 percent and 38.5 percent operating expenses between $6.6 billion and $6.7 billion other income/(expense) of $450 million tax rate of 25.5 percent Apple will provide live streaming of its Q2 2017 financial results conference call beginning at 2:00 p.m. PDT on May 2, 2017 at www.apple.com/investor/earnings-call/.

 Apple Pay is expanding, but it still has a long way to go Jeff Dunn May 19, 2017, 6:18 PM 2,044 facebook linkedin twitter email print More Charts   Apple Pay can be really easy to use — if you can find a retailer that accepts it.  Apple's service, which allows you to store your credit cards on an iPhone and pay for goods at retailers by just tapping your phones on a payment terminal, is gradually becoming available in more countries, as this chart from Statista shows. But it’s still nowhere to be found in wide swaths of the iPhone-using world. And even in the countries where Apple Pay is available, it's still a long way from being universally accepted. The iPhone maker has a fine line to walk with Apple Pay, balancing the interests of merchants, credit card networks, banks (from whom Apple collects a fee), and its customers. It's likely to take a while longer before retailer support for Apply Pay and mobile payments in general becomes ubiquitous. In the meantime, Apple is starting to move its payments service beyond in-store transactions. Apple Pay users can already make purchases with it on the web via the company's Safari browser. Meanwhile, Apple is considering supporting pre-paid debit cards and is working on a service that would compete with Venmo, whose app allows users to share restaurant tabs and send payments to their friends, Recode recently reported.  Diana Yukari/Business Insider/Statista EXCLUSIVE FREE REPORT: 25 Big Tech Predictions by BI Intelligence.

Apps iPhone Apps iPad Apps Mac Apps Apple TV Apps Apple Watch Apps The Best Apps Tutorials Jailbreak Jailbreak Tweaks Jailbreak Guide Unlock Guide Deals Latest Deals Devices iPhone iPad Mac Apple Watch Apple TV More Download Wallpapers iPhone Photography Expert Tips Podcasts Check out breathtaking aerial views of Apple Park building lit up at night Christian Zibreg on May 19, 2017 1 Friday, drone pilot Duncan Sinfield posted his monthly Apple Park construction update showcasing breathtaking aerial views of the massive ring-shaped building lit up at night. The mountain of dirt on Apple’s new campus counties to shrink on a daily basis as contractors continually work on landscaping, planting mature trees around the site. Solar arrays on the building’s roof appear to be completely installed and light posts around the new campus are now active, too. Aside from other impressive features and mind-boggling facts, the main building has nine entrances and sports a large café, basically an atrium-like space four stories high with a pair of huge glass doors that can be opened when it’s nice outside. The café was designed to hold 4,000 people at once, split between the vast ground floor and the balcony dining areas. Here’s Duncan’s latest video. In order to be able to open and close the massive glass doors quietly, they hid the necessary mechanism underground. The glass doors weigh in at a whopping 440,000 pounds each. “The only doors I know of in the world that size are on an airplane hangar,” said Nelli Diller, a managing director for Seele Group, a German company Apple contracted to create the largest, strongest pieces of curved glass in the world for its new corporate office. Each of the 800 45-foot-tall panels of safety glass takes fourteen hours to create. Seele had to expand capacity by working with its autoclave manufacturer to develop a much bigger cooker that could stack five panels at once. “The one we had was the biggest in the glass industry by far. This new one is just … giant,” said Diller. Seele also built glass panels for Apple Stores. Both Google Maps and Apple Maps offer three-dimensional views of Apple Park, although Google’s 3D imagery appears to be a bit out of date. For a video recap of the construction progress made on the 175-acre campus over the past year, check out a birds-eye video by videographer Matthew Roberts. If you like these gorgeous aerial scenes of Apple Park lit up at night, be sure to check out Duncan’s first nighttime footage of the new campus taken about a month ago. Apple gave Wired a rare look inside the building with many previously unknown tidbits about the project and never-before-seen photographs of the meticulously designed interiors. Apple began moving in first employees at the start of April, with about 500 new employees arriving every week thereafter. The iPhone maker expects to finish the move-in process, complete landscaping work and open the visitor center to the public by year-end. Apple Park has a 100,000-square-foot fitness and wellness center for employees which includes a two-story yoga room, as well as access to medical and dental services. “I’m a big believer in people staying active,” said Cook, who is something of a fitness buff himself. “It’s something that makes them feel better and more energetic. It’s all about the fixation on the customer, and the customers here are our people, our employees.” Tagged: Apple Apple Park News Video MORE FROM iDB Video recap: Apple Park construction progress made over past 12 months Windows are being installed along the outside of the main Apple Park building Drone footage reveals Apple Park is starting to come together 我赚啦 古人日三省其身，我从博客里吸收养分！ Featured Latest Daily Deals: $30 SteelSeries Nimbus controller, $69 Jabra Bluetooth headphones, and more Choose any 12 out of these premium apps for only $19.99 Deadpool, Prometheus, and other iTunes movies on sale right now Wallpapers of the week: yellow inspiration Jailbreak tweaks of the week: CCVertically, MusicMoreColumns, WAStatusVolume, & more… Check out breathtaking aerial views of Apple Park building lit up at night Apple publishes 4 new “How to shoot on iPhone 7” video tutorials Daily Deals: $30 SteelSeries Nimbus controller, $69 Jabra Bluetooth headphones, and more How to see how much storage space is available on your Apple Watch iOS 11 concept imagines new productivity features for iPad Jailbreak News iPhone hacked by jailbreak developer to interact with NFC devices PresentPage lets you assign a default Control Center card Last chance to save blobs for, or restore to, iOS 10.3.1 Customize the look and behavior of Notification Center with Lace IconCert lets you know when your Yalu certificate expires Apps Microsoft refreshes OneNote apps with new design and accessibility features Apple’s free app of the week: Eggggg – The Platform Puker Things 3 is out with overhauled interface and multiple new features Futurama: Worlds of Tomorrow coming to iOS, will contain some entirely new episodes Add the Dock to the Today view with this handy tweak Accessories iPhone hacked by jailbreak developer to interact with NFC devices Showdown: who has the best suction car mount?

This means small donations made from inside popular social networks in China will soon be made eligible for Apple’s 30 percent revenue cut. Unlike in the US and other Western markets, in-app tipping is a more common display of gratitude in China toward writers, developers, and other content creators who give out stuff for free. However, Apple last month demanded app makers disable the tipping function per the new App Store rules, which will now recognize any donation as an official in-app purchase. Those who don’t comply risk being kicked out of the App Store, the WSJ reports. Apple is walking a fine line in China Tipping is typically done through apps like the massively popular WeChat, which acts much like a mobile operating system with other services bundled inside of it. This results in Chinese consumers making use of services like food delivery and reading the news all from within WeChat’s ecosystem, which encourages users to tip. Apple, until now, hasn’t seen any of that revenue in the same way it does with app downloads and other more traditional in-app purchases. This debate over tipping is yet another sign that Apple’s relationship with China has become increasingly more fragile. The contention is now a source of concern for the iPhone maker, which has seen the country’s fast-growing population become its largest global software market, with in-app revenues of more than $2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016 alone, according to the WSJ. And yet Apple’s revenues are falling in China and its market share has fallen behind by local Chinese brands, putting the company on the defensive in what is effectively the most important and lucrative market on the planet.

Elyse Betters20 May 2017Smartwatches Pocket-lint Facebook Twitter Pintrest LinkedIn Google+ Mail Comment Tim Cook is reportedly testing a yet-to-be-announced Apple Watch accessory aimed at people with diabetes. According to a report from CNBC, which cited anonymous sources, Apple's chief executive has been wearing a prototype glucose tracker that pairs with the Apple Watch. Keep in mind a previous report from CNBC claimed the Cupertino, CA-based company recently hired a team of biomechanical engineers, with the purpose of developing a noninvasive device that can monitor blood sugar levels. The team has already begun tests with the tracker, which connects to the Apple Watch, while Cook himself told students at the University of Glasgow in February that he had been wearing a glucose tracker so that he could better understand how different foods affect his blood sugar levels: "It's mentally anguishing to stick yourself many times a day to check your blood sugar," Cook said. "There is lots of hope out there that if someone has constant knowledge of what they're eating, they can instantly know what causes the response... and that they can adjust well before they become diabetic," Cook explained, according to CNBC. Apple could update its entire MacBook line at WWDC next month Don't expect an iPad Mini 5: Apple might 'phase out' its smallest tablet Apple Siri speaker and 10.5-inch iPad Pro all but confirmed for WWDC Existing glucose trackers use sensors that pierce the skin in order to be as accurate as possible, but Apple has been rumoured to be working on a noninvasive tracker for people with diabetes for at least five years. If Cook is indeed now testing Apple's version and talking about it openly, it's safe to assume the project may be getting closer to actually being announced and released to the public. Apple's annual developers conference is set to kick off next month. We may hear more about this healthcare device then, unless Apple plans to spend more time perfecting it and conducting feasibility trials.

Andrew Dalton, @dolftown 8h ago in Gadgetry Comments 549 Shares Share Tweet Share Save shutterstock Apple has refused to compensate an Australian woman who woke up on a flight to the sound of her Beats headphones exploding in her face. According to Australian site Adelaide Now, Apple says they have investigated the incident and determined that third-party batteries were to blame. The Beats headphones in question were reportedly an older model, purchased in 2014, that required extra batteries to function. The woman, who is remaining anonymous, said she was disappointed with Apple's decision because, "nowhere on the headphones - or their packaging - did it specify which brand of batteries should be used." Although the woman was burned on her face and hands, she was only seeking reimbursement to replace her headphones and items of clothing she was wearing. Engadget reached out to Apple for comment and we will update this post if we hear back. Battery explosion mid-flight prompts passenger warning. Read more: https://t.co/ggCwATEiDI pic.twitter.com/YTTP9rEzFf— ATSB (@atsbinfo) March 14, 2017 This isn't the first time Beats has had a battery problem. In 2015, Apple recalled the Beats Pill XL speaker because it had a tendency to overheat and risk starting a fire in some rare cases. After the Australian woman's exploding Beats incident in February, Australian regulators issued a warning to leave battery powered devices stowed unless they're in use -- although it's unclear whether that policy would have actually prevented the explosion in this case. Anyhow, those less explosion-prone, zinc-based batteries can't arrive soon enough.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Apple CEO Tweets Out a Photo of Stevie Wonder at Apple's Accessibility Week Concert Held Yesterday | Main May 19, 2017 New Video: A Drone's Sunset Flight over Apple Park   Apple Park has to be the most famous building on the planet when it comes to drone flights per week. There's no end to them. Patently Apple has only covered a few since they began rolling out. Yet today's drone rendezvous takes us on a flight at sunset and a little different perspective. Apple Park should go down in the Guinness World Records for many reasons, but the amount of videos taken while under construction must have broken a record by now to be sure.   &#0160;   Apple should have built a gigantic Ferris Wheel near Apple Park like the one in London called the London Eye so as to allow tourists a way of visiting the construction site safely from a distance and great height. If the city of Cupertino builds one, they'll owe me 10% for the idea. Okay I'm kidding … Okay I'm not. Have a nice weekend.    The video was shot by Duncan Sinfield.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

The four new videos were designed to teach customers how to shoot with zoom on their iPhone 7 Plus, convert their photographs to black & white, as well as take a one-handed selfie and edit it on the phone. How to shoot with zoom on iPhone 7 Plus “Get closer with 2x optical zoom. Or use digital zoom to get up to 10x closer,” says Apple. If you tend to use the zoom feature while shooting video on your iPhone 7 Plus, it may be a good idea to disable the automatic lens switching feature in camera settings to avoid any glitches that may occur when zooming in and out during video capture. How to convert to black & white on iPhone 7 “The right filter and a bit of experimenting with light levels give you a dramatic black-and-white image,” says Apple. How to shoot a one-handed selfie on iPhone 7 “The quick-draw selfie in three easy steps.” How to edit a selfie on iPhone 7 “Use cropping and auto-enhance to create an even better selfie for sharing,” says Apple. If you’d like, feel free to explore additional photography tips and techniques at Apple’s website. The clips join Apple’s seven video tutorials on using iPhone 7’s camera, published last week.

The tech giant’s manufacturing partners have been producing a 10.5-inch iPad Pro since March, and are currently producing around 500,000 units per month, DigiTimes is reporting, citing people who claim to have knowledge of the activity. Apple has asked its manufacturing partners to boost production on the tablet to 600,000 units in July, and anticipates shipping 5 million to 6 million units through the end of the year, according to the report. However, DigiTimes’ Apple reports aren’t always right, so its latest report should be viewed with that context. The report follows months of speculation that Apple is planning a big iPad update this year. The company announced the new iPad in March, featuring a 9.7-inch screen and improved processing power. But Apple is said to be working on bigger updates to its professionally focused iPad Pro line. Chief among those updates, according to several rumors, is a 10.5-inch iPad Pro. Get Data Sheet, Fortune's technology newsletter Apple currently sells a 9.7-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pro. Both devices run on the company’s iOS mobile operating system and support the Apple Pencil stylus for digitally writing on the screen. Apple is reportedly planning a 10.5-inch screen that would fit into a chassis about the same size as the 9.7-inch iPad Pro. Apple would be able to achieve that by reducing the size of the bezels around the screen, according to reports. It’s unknown what other features the 10.5-inch iPad Pro might offer, if it even exists at all. There is also some speculation around the Internet whether Apple might decide to eliminate the 9.7-inch iPad Pro and replace it with the 10.5-inch option or keep all three models. Although Apple has remained silent on its plans, the company is rumored to be planning an iPad unveiling at its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) keynote on June 5.

It’s something that other smartwatch makers have done and Apple itself has explored in patents. And this month there have been a few hints that make the prospect of smart bands a little more exciting with multiple reports saying Apple has been working on and testing blood sugar tracking technology for diabetes treatment… The best 4K & 5K displays for Mac Earlier this week a report that Apple CEO Tim Cook has been spotted testing glucose monitors attached to his Apple Watch followed several others that Apple is actively developing such technology for the device. One of those reports also claimed Apple was working on interchangeable smart straps, which it speculated could mean glucose monitoring would be offered as an attachment. But beyond recent reports, Apple itself has a number of patents for health sensors, cameras, batteries and more being incorporated into the Apple Watch bracelet links and bands. It’s definitely something the company has at the very least considered. Not everyone is for the idea of smart straps, however. Some might question whether or not a ‘smart bands’ platform is the right way to go. You’d gain benefits with a physical connection to the Watch and new features that aren’t currently possible with Bluetooth accessories. However, it might also mean Apple leaving extended battery life, cameras, and other sensors and features up to third-parties. This could result in bulky bands, and products having to be approved through the sometimes slow-moving MFi (or similar) licensing program. For that reason some might prefer it wait for battery enhancements and other internal improvements that won’t sacrifice the Apple Watch’s current design and user experience.

Club MacStoriesWeekly Extras MENU ABOUT PODCAST NEWSLETTER ADVERTISE SECTIONS APP REVIEWS IPAD DIARIES STORIES APPLE HISTORY IOS AUTOMATION GAMES Things 3: Beauty and Delight in a Task Manager Workflow Update Restores Google Chrome and Pocket Actions, Extends Apple Music Integration Dispelling the Apple Services Myth iOS 11: iPad Wishes and Concept Video By Federico Viticci iOS 11 for iPad concept.(Full-res) Once heralded as a promising sign of Apple's renewed commitment to the iPad, iOS 9 has begun to feel like a one-hit wonder. iOS 9 represented a profound change for Apple's approach to the iPad. After years of stagnation and uninspired imitation of iPhone interface paradigms, iOS 9 allowed the iPad to explore the true potential of its large canvas; for the first time since the original tablet, Apple was creating new iPad-only features rather than adapting them from the iPhone. Split View, Slide Over, and Picture in Picture were drastic departures from the classic iPad interaction model that, however, perfectly fit the device. As I concluded in my iOS 9 review: This year, the iPad is getting the first version of iOS truly made for it. After too many unimaginative releases, Apple has understood the capabilities of the iPad's display and its nature of modern portable computer. Free of dogmas and preconceptions of what an iPad ought to be, iOS 9 fundamentally reinvents what an iPad can become going forward. In a span of six months, the one-two punch of iOS 9 and iPad Pro redefined the concept of portable computer again, setting Apple on a new path for the iPad ecosystem. Or, at least, it seemingly did. Since late 2015, Apple hasn't had too much to show for the iPad. A smaller version of the iPad Pro was released in early 2016, though the new device mostly adapted features from the bigger version to a more compact form factor, introducing inconsistencies to the iPad line in the process, such as the True Tone display (still exclusive to the 9.7" iPad Pro). iOS 10, while a solid upgrade overall, focused on iPhone users and lifestyle enhancements; for iPad users, iOS 10 was a disappointment that failed to build upon iOS 9. The first iPad Pro – launched in November 2015 – has lingered without updates, raising questions on the actual need for one of its marquee features – the Smart Connector that only Apple and Logitech have supported so far. And amid consistently declining sales, the company's only "new" hardware after the iPad Pro has been a lower-priced and rebranded iPad Air – a solid entry model, but another adaptation. We haven't seen something truly new, bold, and transformational happen on the iPad platform in nearly two years. It's time for Apple to step up their game and continue pursuing the vision for the future of computing set forth in 2015. There's so much more work to be done with iOS, multitasking, and the redefinition of computing for the multitouch era. The iPad Pro can be a computer for everything, but it needs another leap forward to become the computer for everyone. And that can't happen without a serious reconsideration of its software. The iPad needs another bold, daring step towards the future. With iOS 11, Apple has an opportunity to pick up where they left off with iOS 9, forging a new direction for the iPad platform. Every year ahead of WWDC, I collect some of my thoughts about the current state of iOS and consider where Apple could take their software next. I've been doing this for the past several years going back to iOS 6 in 2012. I've referred to these stories as "wishes" because they encapsulate all the aspects I'd like Apple to improve in their mobile OS. Last year, we added a concept video to the mix. This year, I wanted to prepare something different and more specific. iOS for iPhone is, I believe, at a point of sufficient maturity: aside from particular feature additions, I don't think there's anything fundamentally missing from the iPhone.1 The iPad now bears the proverbial low-hanging fruit of iOS. There are obvious areas of improvement on iOS for iPad, which is, effectively, two years behind its iPhone counterpart. The iPad's lack of meaningful software advancements allows us to explore deeper ideas; thus, in a break with tradition, I decided to focus this year's iOS Wishes exclusively on the iPad and where Apple could take its software next. Like last year, I collaborated with Sam Beckett to visualize my ideas for iOS 11 on the iPad with a concept video and detailed mockups. This time, instead of showcasing our ideas as standalone concepts, we imagined a "day in the life" theme for the video, showing how enhancements to iOS for iPad would work in practice. Rather than showcasing random bits of possible features, we imagined an underlying task to be accomplished (planning a vacation in Barcelona) and how better iPad software could help. I've been thinking about some of these ideas since iOS 9 (you can see a thread between my iOS 10 concept and this year's version), while others would be a natural evolution for iOS on the iPad. Once again, Sam was able to visualize everything with a fantastic concept that, I believe, captures the iPad's big-picture potential more accurately than last year. Below, you'll find our iOS 11 for iPad concept video, followed by an analysis of my iPad wishes with static mockups. I focused on foundational changes to the iPad's software – tentpole features that would affect the entire OS and app ecosystem. This isn't a prediction of what Apple will announce at WWDC; it's my vision for what the future of the iPad should be. Making Of: iOS 11 Concept Exclusively for Club MacStories members, we'll publish a Behind the Scenes look at our iOS 11 concept video in our MacStories Weekly newsletter later this week.

You can listen to the episode here. Drag & Drop, System-Wide Drag & drop is widely regarded as a "legacy feature" that was conceived for mouse cursors and desktop computers, but I always thought it'd work well on the iPad. Direct content manipulation is, after all, the iPad's raison d'être: while on a Mac the cursor is an abstraction of your hand dragging an object across windows, on the iPad your finger could physically swipe across the screen as it holds a selection of content underneath. Existing implementations of drag & drop on iOS have proven the idea's feasibility (see: Safari tabs, iMessage stickers), and I believe a system-wide drag & drop feature would be a natural and powerful complement to iPad multitasking. On the surface, native drag & drop between iPad apps would feel immediately intuitive. Users could select any piece of content – an image, some text, a link, or a document – and long-press with one finger until the content lifts up and can be dragged away. Dropping some text onto an app's icon in Split View. A grabbed item could be dropped somewhere else in the current app, or users could drag it towards another app in Split View and drop it where they want it to be (spring-loading could be used to navigate across app UIs). Because drag & drop would be fully multitouch-enabled, it wouldn't block the iOS interface: another finger could be used to navigate in a different "drop area" of an app, or a user could keep dragging until the Split View app picker is shown and drop an item onto an app's icon, opening a contextual action menu. A quick action menu for lines of text dropped on Reminders' icon. If Apple wants to bring drag & drop to the iPad, I believe they'd do so by eschewing the complexities of the Mac. If drag & drop comes to iOS 11, it needs to be easier, faster, and safer than any desktop alternative. This would require a massive engineering effort and an intelligent design to rethink drag & drop interactions for the touch era and the iPad's UI. Drag & drop on iOS 11 needs to be easier, faster, and safer than any desktop alternative. Drag & drop on iOS should never lead to accidental data loss or open app screens that users aren't expecting. By default, dropping an item into another app would create a copy – it wouldn't move it from the original location. In addition, while anything that can be selected by the user should support drag & drop out of the box (within specific format types), iOS 11 apps would have the ability to mark certain items as not available to drag & drop.2 In any case, it should always be clear to the user what can be dragged and where it can be dropped, with a consistent activation gesture and a behavior that doesn't yield surprising results. This also means building a drag & drop feature that offers high performance on any compatible iPad model. Apple's priority should be to ensure that drag & drop always hits 60 fps when dragging: a selected item must follow the user's fingertip while in drag & drop mode with no latency or perceptible lag. The combination of multitouch and high frame rates would allow drag & drop to work alongside the iOS interface in a natural way – it would feel like a native extension of the user's finger and the iOS selection method. Dragged items would fly across the screen smoothly, and users could still navigate app interfaces (and perhaps even hit the Home button) to drop an item wherever they want. Native drag & drop between apps would require explicit adoption by third-party developers. There are two problems to consider: dragging an item, and dropping it somewhere else. This means understanding what kind of item the user is dragging (an image, some text, a PDF, etc.) and showing where it can be dropped. What happens, for instance, if the user tries to drop an image into the Safari address bar? What happens if a PDF is dropped onto Tweetbot's compose box? I imagine that iOS could handle the first set of problems automatically (translating between different file types3), but I suspect that iOS 11 will offer an API that will require developers to support drag & drop by defining what can be dragged, how it can be interpreted, and what can be received as a dropped item in their apps. Moreover, to solve the potential confusion caused by dropping an item into an app that isn't quite sure what to do with it, developers could provide Quick Look extensions to enable the receiver app to preview the dropped item in their context and display a menu with available options. Alternatively, apps could provide quick action UIs (as extensions) for dropped content that they support. Reminders, for instance, could offer to create new todos for lines of text dragged from another app; Notes could present a dialog to create a new note from image or save it into an existing note. Overall, most of these are technicalities that Apple figured out decades ago on the desktop.4 The same system could be extended to iOS and modernized for integration with apps and extensions. Despite the complexities involved, drag & drop increasingly feels like something that needs to come to the iPad. It just makes a lot more sense to be able to directly manipulate and move content around on a large multitouch screen than it does with a cursor and a smaller trackpad. There would be challenges for Apple and developers, but, after Split View and the large iPad Pro, it seems obvious that the next step is to let users manipulate content further and move it anywhere. Drag & drop on iPad could become the fastest way to share any piece of data between apps. Users wouldn't have to rely on the clipboard or the share sheet to slowly move data between apps anymore. With drag & drop, content would be naturally rearranged and dropped as needed, solving one of the biggest problems of working on the iPad. Shelf There are times when you want to save something without necessarily dropping it into an app or sharing it with the clipboard or extensions. For better or worse5, macOS users can drag anything they want to reference later on the desktop (or any other Finder window); iOS has no such area that serves as a holding place for bits of content without an immediate destination. I'd like iOS 11 to bring a Shelf feature to the iPad that would let users clip anything with drag & drop. The Shelf would sit above apps (both in full-screen mode or Split View) and it'd be revealed automatically when the user is dragging an item towards the top of the screen. The Shelf would come down and display previously saved items as thumbnail previews; by default, new items are dropped into the leftmost side of the Shelf, though users could choose to drop an item between existing ones, or on top of another item to create a folder. The Shelf.(Full-res) The idea behind the Shelf is to make it as effortless as possible to hold something for later without the cognitive load of deciding which app or extension should receive it right away. The Shelf would be heavily tied to the new drag & drop framework and it'd be inspired by previous implementations (such as the NeXTSTEP shelf) and older desktop apps (examples: DragThing and Yoink). Think of it as a transient dock for temporary clippings, or, even better, as a multi-slot clipboard that can hold a variety of items and be consistently available across apps. The Shelf would be local to each iPad, and it could hold an infinite number of items; the Shelf would be paginated and users could scroll between multiple pages to find the item they're looking for. Anything could be dropped in the Shelf: from text selections and images to phone numbers and even songs; as long as an item supports drag & drop on iOS 11, the Shelf could hold it for later. Even in its apparent simplicity, the Shelf would still be a feature for iPad power-users who want a better way to deal with multiple bits of content. As such, the Shelf would require a specific gesture to be activated when users want to pull content from the Shelf and drop it into an app. In our concept, a three-finger swipe opens the Shelf when an item is not being dragged towards it; this gesture wouldn't conflict with scrolling in apps, text cursor movement, or Notification Center. When the user has identified an item they need, they can grab it from the Shelf and insert it into a compatible app.6 While the Shelf would act primarily as a scrollable tray of temporary clippings, it could also support inline actions for previews and other content-specific shortcuts. By tapping an item in the Shelf, iOS 11 would display a custom Quick Look preview with additional information and actions contextual to the selected item. A contextual menu for an address saved in the Shelf. With a Quick Look API, items could embed native actions in their preview. For example, a phone number could be called with an iPhone through Continuity, and Maps locations could be previewed and re-opened in the Maps app. This way, the Shelf would be skewed towards exporting clippings via drag & drop, but manual actions on a per-item basis would also be allowed. The multi-slot nature of the Shelf, combined with its ease of activation facilitated by drag & drop, would dramatically improve any workflow occurring on the iPad. Students writing essays in Pages could drop images, web links, and other source material in the Shelf and later add them to a document with a few swipes; photographers could assemble assets in the Shelf (either as folders or individual items) and easily import them in a graphic editor; even casual note-taking or email processing could be improved by cutting the time normally involved with moving data back and forth between apps. The Shelf, along with system-wide drag & drop, would rethink the relationship between users and app content. Apple needs to take advantage of the iPad's large screen to simplify working with bits of content across apps. The Shelf can solve all these problems in a unique, iPad-only way. New Split View App Picker As I argued last year, the Split View app picker is the feature that has aged the worst since the launch of iOS 9. Without the ability to manually search for apps or to pin frequently used apps as favorites, the picker has always felt like it had been designed by engineers to ship a barely passable UI at the last minute. Apple had a chance to rethink the basic traits of the iPad's multitasking interface; instead, they released a shallow, clumsy picker that should have been fixed years ago and that is still with us today. A redesigned Split View app picker. The Split View app picker has to be redesigned from scratch. Building on last year's concept, I envision a picker that would address all the shortcomings of the existing design: The picker would allow users to arrange their most-used apps on a grid, similar to a mini Home screen; There would be an integrated Spotlight option to search for specific apps (or app content) and launch them directly in Split View; The picker could be displayed on either side of Split View, with an option to swap the primary and secondary app (a long-press on the picker "handle" at the top); Recently used apps would still be displayed at the bottom of the picker as cards. Unlike iOS 10, every app – not just the most recently used one – would carry a preview of its last-seen state (like in the system multitasking view); Every app icon/card displayed in the picker would support spring-loading for items passed via drag & drop, enabling users to quickly open files in different apps or insert discrete data into app views; The entire Split View picker UI could be invoked and navigated with an external keyboard, removing the need to touch the screen when an iPad is used on a desk. A revamped app picker design based on these principles would greatly increase the usability and speed of Split View, but it would also introduce a different set of trade-offs and usability concerns to be addressed by Apple. Specifically, while the picker could be invoked on either side of the screen, it couldn't be shown simultaneously on both sides, as it would cause issues with users attempting to open the same app in two places. Furthermore, I imagine that Apple could dim an app's icon in the Split View grid if the app is already active on the other side. A dimmed app icon means the app is already in Split View. I'm convinced that Split View is the best feature Apple has brought to the iPad in years, but the implementation of its launcher leaves much to be desired. An efficient multitasking UI needs a fast and customizable activation method to be pervasive and scalable; the current Split View misses the mark on all of this. By extending Split View with user-assigned favorites and activation on both sides of the screen, Apple could take the entire iPad multitasking experience to the next level. Finder The argument that the iPad doesn't "need a filesystem" lost its validity when Apple introduced document providers in iOS 8 and the iCloud Drive app in iOS 9. iOS already has a visible filesystem, only it's been rebuilt with simplicity in mind for the age of apps so it doesn't expose system information like on macOS. The next logical step for Apple is to turn their scattershot implementation of document pickers and providers into a true Finder layer that can work with every app and be more cohesive and intuitive than what we have today. A Finder for iOS. I'm not proposing that Apple brings the Mac's Finder to iOS, diverting from the app-based approach that has characterized the iPhone and iPad. Instead, I think all the pieces of the current system – iCloud Drive, the document picker, and document providers –should be unified into a single Finder app and system-wide layer available everywhere. With a dedicated Finder app and Finder view in every app, users would be able to find the files they're looking for with a consistent interface. Developers of third-party apps, on the other hand, could leverage new APIs to more easily offer documents and data to other apps, enabling them to talk to each other and collaborate on documents without resorting to extensions, flaky document providers, or, worse, duplicate copies of the same file. The first step would be a standalone Finder app that blends iCloud Drive and third-party app storage in a powerful file manager that adopts the best aspects of the desktop Finder. By default, all user-created files would be stored in a top-level iCloud Drive view, eschewing the notion of local-only storage.7 This would be the evolution of the existing iCloud Drive app (one of the worst apps Apple has shipped on iOS in years) and it'd be the place where users could create folders and organize their files. The Finder app would have all the features you'd expect from a modern file manager: column and grid views, built-in iCloud sharing with permission controls, tags, versions, saved searches, and even Siri integration. These are features that I also envisioned last year, and I continue to believe that iPad users would only applaud a more serious iCloud Drive and file management UI. The second step involves apps. In the current implementation of the document picker, apps can either be available as "folders" in iCloud Drive, or they can be opened as external document providers that have their own UIs and sync logic. I think Apple should slowly deprecate standalone document providers in favor of native Finder extensions that would let apps take advantage of the Finder's built-in UI (where Apple has done most of the work) with options to enhance it with sharing/collaboration features and their own sync mechanisms. Document providers, reimagined as Finder extensions. An integrated and extensible iOS Finder would accomplish two important goals: it'd let apps become top-level destinations akin to iCloud Drive, and it'd provide a clean and safe way to modify the Finder's interface for each app's needs without having to take users out of the Finder environment and into a separate, less powerful document provider UI. This way, developers of apps that don't require additional controls could integrate with the Finder and use iCloud Drive as storage8; companies with deeper requirements, such as Dropbox or Microsoft, could still integrate with the familiar, system-wide Finder UI and enhance it for their own services. Ultimately, users would enjoy a consistent, safe, more powerful Finder experience that works with any app rather than having to constantly switch between iCloud Drive, iCloud Drive-enabled apps, and other document providers. File versions in Finder. A true Finder for iOS would have ramifications that go beyond a new icon on the Home screen. The Finder would become the new default document picker: instead of a popup listing a bunch of standalone locations, you'd get a full-blown Finder dialog to open files from any folder or app, considerably reducing the time spent remembering where a file can be found. With a new set of APIs and user permissions, iOS 11 could allow apps to more easily open each other's documents in complex (but intuitive) workflows that aren't possible today. And, obviously, automation could play a role in this down the road, opening the door to ideas such as folder-monitoring utilities and file automation either via Workflow or Hazel-like apps. One of the common misconceptions on iOS is that it doesn't have a file management UI. That stopped being true years ago when Apple launched a new document picker and document providers. iOS has a rudimentary file manager built-in, but its implementation is fragmented, slow, and inconsistent. For the sake of simplicity, Apple ended up creating a system more difficult and prone to errors than the file manager they've offered for decades on the Mac. With iOS 11, Apple has a chance to rebalance file management with a centralized repository that is inspired by the Mac but still entrenched in the core principles and technologies native to iOS. The iPad needs a single Finder for everything – built atop iOS' vibrant app ecosystem, fully integrated with the Shelf and drag & drop, and without the complexity of the Mac. Refreshed Design As you might have noticed from the video and mockups in this story, we've imagined a slightly refreshed iOS design language built on the principles of increased visual feedback, context, and bolder typography. In my iOS 10 review, I noted that Apple appeared to be experimenting with multiple variations of the iOS interface. From the bold headlines of Apple Music to the use of thicker icons and more tappable buttons, Apple seemed to be slowly moving away from the excessively thin, low-contrast aesthetic of iOS 7 to embrace a more approachable, friendly UI optimized for 3D Touch and sloppy swipes. A redesigned App Store, inspired by Apple Music. I don't think an Apple Music-style interface would work as a system-wide design for every app, but iOS 11 could borrow some of its underlying criteria and apply them elsewhere. The App Store would be a good candidate for an Apple Music-inspired redesign; the company's storefront is already heavily based on image galleries, product grids, and section titles that would work well alongside the Apple Music style. Apple could also bring aspects of the watchOS interface to iOS and move beyond the static, inexpressive nature of its UI. Touch-down states for icons and buttons – some of my favorite details of watchOS' design – would add useful context to iOS toolbar icons and menus as well. Updated icons from our iOS 11 concept. Combined with subtle animations, thicker lines, and a consistent use of colors, app interfaces could become more lively and informative without the need for a major design overhaul. Other Enhancements In addition to the major changes I described above, there are more features and improvements I'd like to see in iOS 11 for iPad. Easier access to frequently used extensions. The share sheet as we know it has run its course: besides discoverability problems for extensions that users don't know how to activate, it's a cumbersome feature in that it always adds a step between hitting the Share icon and performing an action. With iOS 11, the share sheet should become more flexible and allow users to pin their favorite extensions to app toolbars and other UI elements. App extensions updated for iOS 11 could include support for a monochrome glyph to be used in "quick access mode". To pin an extension, a user would only have to drag it out of the share sheet and drop it into an empty spot in a toolbar, which would also include built-in controls to re-arrange pinned extensions and reset them (sending them back to the share sheet).9 Imagine having faster access to the 1Password extension in Safari, or a Todoist button in your favorite news reader to save articles for later. The time savings granted by a more flexible share sheet would add up over time. More importantly, they'd enable power users to be more efficient when working with extensions, and they'd also allow developers to stop building their own app integrations just because they don't require the share sheet. A denser Home screen. I'm still not convinced that putting widgets alongside app icons on the Home screen would be a good idea, but one thing's for certain – the Home screen on the iPad feels like a waste of space. A more compact Home screen on the 12.9" iPad Pro.(Full-res) A single Home screen should display more than 25 apps at once on the 12.9" iPad Pro. By moving from 5 apps to 7 apps per row (in landscape), the Home screen would grow to 35 apps on a single screen – a 40% increase over the existing Home screen design. A more compact Home screen would result in less time spent swiping across pages to find apps, and a faster iPad experience overall. Multiple audio streams. I find it odd that, on its tenth anniversary, iOS still can't deal with concurrent audio streams. In the age of live streams, Let's Plays, and music streaming, being able to keep multiple media streams going at the same time has become the norm on desktop computers, and yet iOS devices still pause background audio when you start watching a video. I understand why Apple went with this approach years ago, but there's a deeper discussion here about the need for a revamped audio framework with support for simultaneous audio streams on iOS. Besides allowing users to watch silent live streams while listening to other audio, developers of audio apps could use the more robust system for more complex audio workflows as well. Multiple audio streams in Control Center for iPad. The benefits for podcasting and audio mixing apps would be obvious – GarageBand could record audio from Skype calls, while apps like Audiobus could forgo the SDKs they've built to work with simultaneous audio streams. Apple could use the dedicated audio page of Control Center to manage audio sources, which would gain individual playback controls and color highlights to indicate which app is playing audio on iOS 11. A more versatile Notes. Apple's revamped Notes app was one of the highlights of iOS 9, but, like other features mentioned in this story, it barely received any attention since. In the meantime, capable alternatives to Notes have appeared on the App Store and bigger players such as Evernote and Microsoft have continued to enhance their apps for casual and power users alike. Free-form sketching and richer links in Notes. I wouldn't change the core structure of Notes, but I'd improve its capabilities on multiple fronts. Apple Pencil users should have an option to sketch anywhere on a note without having to enter a specific drawing screen. This would turn notes into free-form mixes of typed notes and sketches comparable to apps such as Notability and GoodNotes.10 Like the latter, Notes should support handwriting recognition with OCR and make text searchable.11 In addition to individual notes, there should be support for sharing entire folders with other users. Plus, the iOS app should be able to create nested folders like on the Mac, and rich link snippets should be richer than their current implementation – perhaps borrowing from iMessage's superior link previews. Mail becomes pro and modern. Of all system apps, Mail is the most antiquated one. The market of email clients has changed over the past few years: every major player in this space now offers features such as snoozing, smart folders and saved searches, app integrations, and other functionalities that enhance dealing with email without reinventing the protocol behind it. From Outlook to Spark, Newton, Polymail, and dozens of others, there's clearly demand for apps that modernize and supercharge email. A Snooze option for messages in Mail. Apple Mail, on the other hand, feels stuck in the past. Apple has both failed to deliver an iOS version with all the functionalities of their Mac app, and they haven't kept up with innovation happening in other email clients. At the very least, Mail should gain more powerful (and fast) search features with the ability to create smart folders, and Apple should add a snooze option for messages. But if the company is planning a bigger revamp of Mail, they should reconsider the in-app split screen mode that they almost brought to iOS 10 last year, and they should come up with an API to let other iOS apps integrate with Mail to process and save messages elsewhere. Nobody likes dealing with email, but that doesn't mean the tools we use to manage it should be subpar. There's plenty Apple could bring to Mail if they want to keep up with the competition and offer a modern email experience for iPad users. iOS 11 iOS 9 was supposed to be a new beginning for the iPad. Two years later, we're still waiting for what comes next. We were given a taste of the future, and left hoping there would be more. It's time for Apple to go back to the iPad and fulfill the promise of a device that can redefine modern computing. iOS 9 seemed to hint at a different Apple – capable of rethinking fundamental traits of the iPad's software while respecting its legacy and essence. I want to see the same approach and bold vision in iOS 11, with the iPad growing into a computing platform that takes the best features of the Mac and reimagines them for our times. I want to see the iPad ecosystem thrive again, creating new incentives for developers to craft desktop-class apps and for users to invest in the iPad as their primary computer. iOS 9 was an outstanding update, but there's so much more the iPad can be. We're ready for something new. I'd like to see an overall design refresh of the iOS interface, which includes the iPhone, but I don't consider that as missing functionality. ↩︎ For example, an app like 1Password could disable drag & drop for login items, but allow users to drop text into a secure note. ↩︎ If only Apple had a technology capable of intelligently converting between data formats that could be integrated at a system level... ↩︎ At least since Drag Manager on System 7. ↩︎ Check out the replies to this question on Twitter for some interesting screenshots. ↩︎ In my mind, an item pulled from the Shelf and dropped into an app shouldn't be automatically deleted from the Shelf as I can see the benefit of dropping the same item in multiple locations. Thus, each item would have to be manually deleted from the Shelf, though we also imagined a 'Delete All' option for quicker Shelf management. ↩︎ Of course, an offline mode should be available for users who aren't always connected to the Internet. There should also be an option to mark important documents as always available for offline access, regardless of the OS' intelligent caching. And, users could turn off iCloud Drive altogether if they can't or don't want to use the service. ↩︎ Apps could also show up in the Finder without having to integrate with iCloud Drive at all – cloud storage and sync would be optional. ↩︎ The 12.9" iPad Pro would have plenty of space for additional buttons in toolbars of apps like Safari when in landscape mode. In Split View and on smaller iPads, there could be an overflow menu to display buttons that don't fit in a single view (just like Safari currently handles bookmarks that don't fit on the screen). ↩︎ This might require backtracking on the previously-backtracked decision to use the Pencil for standard touch navigation, but I think Apple will have to make some changes here eventually. I understand that some users prefer to use their Pencils to control the iOS interface, but I think that could become an option under Accessibility. That way, users who have to deal with RSI issues would still be able to navigate iOS with a Pencil, but others could gain new options and features when a Pencil is detected on the screen, such as drawing anywhere in Notes without having to press a dedicated software button. ↩︎ Egg freckles? ↩︎ Tags: iOS 11, iPad Sign Up Unlock MacStories Extras Club MacStories offers exclusive access to extra MacStories content, delivered every week; it’s also a way to support us directly.

That stock price rally comes despite an already high valuation multiple, which appears to price in some very lofty expectations for growth. Why the surge? Nvidia continues to prove it’s the company of the future. The technology powerhouse, which was named Yahoo Finance’s 2016 company of the year, powers Google searches, Amazon’s Alexa digital assistant, Tesla’s self-driving cars and Netflix’s movie recommendations. And it’s become a dominant force in the continued shift toward artificial intelligence. The excitement over this company’s prospects can be seen across tech, including the big-cap tech. View photos An aerial view of the new Apple headquarters (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)More The impressive 19% gain for the S&P 500 (^GSPC) over the last year is eclipsed by the 32% surge in the Nasdaq 100 (^NDX). Importantly, the source of the Nasdaq’s outperformance are the major tech stocks, including Apple (AAPL) , Alphabet (GOOGL) , Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN) and Facebook (FB), which make up 42% of the Nasdaq 100 versus 13% of the S&P. Source: Goldman Sachs Weekly Kickstart presentationMore And much of the upward movement of these names may not even incorporate optimism around long-term opportunities where monetization remains elusive. Amazon At an incredibly high 81x forward P/E, Amazon has not been trading on traditional metrics for some time. But Needham analyst Kerry Rice said the high price doesn’t even incorporate long-term bets at this point. “A lot of investors are counting on that at some point Amazon flips the switch on profitability where they pull back on investing and you get a hockey stick trajectory of profitability,” Rice said. In other words, because the company could eventually become significantly more profitable, its P/E multiple is only temporarily elevated. The $450 billion company has continued to soar on progress in its core business, with its first quarter report merely the latest sign of dominance. Its stock is up almost 1,300% in the last ten years. Last quarter, revenue of $35.7 billion topped analyst estimates, and the key focus remains the near-term market opportunity. With about 100 million monthly unique visitors and about $1 out of every $3 spent online, analysts say there is still considerable upside in the core e-commerce business (with still only 10% of retail today). And growth in Amazon Web Services (AWS) is boosting profitability. View photos   Bezos’ longer-term vision isn’t even baked in to the company’s seemingly high multiple, according to analysts. The company has several multi-billion dollar opportunities, according to Rice, including video, advertising, groceries, and home services. In his most recent shareholder letter, Bezos highlighted that Amazon remains a “Day 1 company,” just at the beginning of its potential. “The outside world can push you into Day 2 if you won’t or can’t embrace powerful trends quickly,” Bezos wrote. “If you fight them, you’re probably fighting the future. Embrace them and you have a tailwind.” Long-term projects like autonomous Prime Air delivery drones could lead to more upside, but in the meantime Bezos has focused on near-term practical applications of technology, which is really what is driving the stock, according to analysts. Read More Bezos emphasized in his letter that the company’s focus on artificial intelligence has led to outward facing initiatives like cloud-based AI assistant Alexa (the company announced updates to Amazon Echo on Tuesday). But it has also driven much beneath the surface, “quietly but meaningfully improving core operations,” including algorithms that aid with demand forecasting, product search ranking, merchandising placements and fraud detection for the core business. Apple With an $800 billion market capitalization, Apple’s more tempered valuation (15x forward earnings) is still based on growth for its core product, the iPhone, which makes up 60% of company revenue. And even the company’s most recent quarterly results were overshadowed by expectations of the next smartphone (the iPhone 8 expected this fall, a decade after the initial iPhone launch). CEO Tim Cook said that iPhone demand this past quarter may have begun to “pause” in anticipation of new offerings, particularly in China which is even more sensitive to new announcements. Meanwhile, the company’s services business remains a quiet beast, according to Credit Suisse’s Kulbinder Garcha, who pointed out that the division’s revenue could rise to $52 billion from $26 billion today. And given that gross margins for services are around 70%, it would mean services will drive gross margin over 40% longer-term . While headlines continue to pop up about opportunities in automobiles, none of this is baked into the stock at these levels, according to Canaccord’s Michael Walkley, particularly at such a subdued valuation. Alphabet Ever since Alphabet separated its “other bets” business from its core search platform Google in the beginning of 2016, the stock has surged. And the company’s 24x forward P/E valuation is largely based on strong core results, according to analysts. In its most recent quarter, paid clicks grew 53% across Google-owned sites. Growth in its core search business has allowed the company to focus and separate its longer term projects. View photos   Today’s “Other Bets”—which include smart-home technology Nest, autonomous driving, and Google Fiber to improve internet speeds—could potentially bring in significant revenue down the road and  keep the company relevant, according to analysts. “But right now, no one is buying the stock for those reasons,” Rice said. “Autonomous driving may be more impactful five to ten years out,” Rice said. Facebook At 1.9 billion monthly users, an increase of 17% year-over-year, Facebook isn’t showing any signs of slowing down. And the stock, trading at 22x forward P/E, was little changed after its most recent quarter despite commentary from founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg that revenue growth would decline “meaningfully” as it stops increasing the frequency of marketing spots in the news feed later this year in an effort to retain users. Rice explained the near-term levers for the company haven’t even been flipped on. Mobile now accounts for 85% of its advertising revenue and the company is looking forward to more opportunities. Instagram, with 700 million monthly active users, has just started adding to revenue growth. Zuckerberg said he has been focused on monetizing Messenger, which was spun off as a separate app in 2014, thoughtfully. The app now has 1.2 billion monthly users. WhatsApp, which was acquired in 2014 for $22 billion, is a big monetization opportunity for the company as well. While Zuckerberg is seen as a visionary, Rice said at this point longer-term bets are not baked into valuation—and mobile-driven surge since its IPO five years ago. View photos During the company’s recent F8 conference, management highlighted its augmented reality platform which includes “Facebook Faces,” the new social experience for Oculus Rift.  Management even discussed projects including its unmanned solar-powered aicraft that will beam internet connectivity to people around the world and brain interfaces (mind control!). “Investors have fallen in love with Facebook,” according to Mark Moerdler said. “There are expectations for huge upside from a revenue point of view… especially long-term. But much of this is based on clearly outlined near-term opportunities from the company.” Microsoft Part of the driver behind Microsoft’s surge over the last several years is because of the company’s shift to cloud and long-term projects under CEO Satya Nadella who took over in early 2014. In short, the company is often discussed in the same breath as Amazon and Google and has somehow left the sphere of “old tech” and into “new tech”. And Microsoft’s valuation, at 21x forward P/E, has pulled away from “old tech” names it used to be grouped with, like IBM (IBM) at 12x. But “new tech” for Microsoft hasn’t meant out-there long-term projects. The stock, up 36% in the last year alone, has been able to monetize its shift to cloud, according to analysts. While the company still relies on some of its traditional applications (like Office), commercial cloud revenues have grown to about 60% of the business. The company’s acquisition of LinkedIn in June 2016 was emblematic of the company’s shift for near-term opportunities in a higher-growth arena. The bottom line: Tech companies have been surging based on huge market opportunities, but the valuations may not even incorporate long-term bets, meaning there could even be more upside for this sector, which has been defined as driven by “secular growth” and more immune from macro shifts.

Unveiled at a special event in New York on Tuesday, the laptop is the Redmond, Washington-based company’s biggest attempt to combat Apple (AAPL) and Google’s (GOOG, GOOGL) increasingly dominant presences in American colleges. The $999 Surface Laptop is a slim, sleek notebook with a gorgeous 13.5-inch, touch screen display that runs a special version of Microsoft’s Windows 10 operating system called Windows 10 S. Consumers can also upgrade from Windows 10 S to Windows 10 Pro for $49.99. Panos Panay, corporate VP of Microsoft’s Surface group, took the stage during the event to show off the new device, and was effusive in his love for the notebook’s design. He called the laptop soulful and beautiful. “We built a laptop, and it’s beautiful,” Panay said. “But it’s beautiful because it’s personal. It’s personal because it’s meant to be a reflection of who you are. It brings that security and superior performance. And probably most important is it’s going to last you.” At 2.7 pounds, the Surface Laptop is lighter and thinner than Apple’s $999 MacBook Air, but a bit heavier and thicker than the ultra slim, though less powerful MacBook. Inside, the laptop gets either a Core i5 or Core i7 processor, up to 1TB of storage and a ridiculous 14.5 hours of battery life. Panay took dead aim at the Apple’s laptops, saying that the Surface Laptop is 50% more powerful than Apple’s MacBook Air and offers more battery life than any MacBook on the market. The laptop’s keyboard uses the same kind of fabric backing found on the Surface Keyboard Cover for the Surface Pro on its keyboard deck. It can also take advantage of the Microsoft’s Surface Pen and Surface Dial. The Surface Laptop’s keyboard deck is covered in a soft fabric.More It’s safe to say that the Surface Laptop easily bests any Google Chromebook on the market in terms of design. What’s more, because it’s running a version of Windows, the Surface Laptop is able to run full programs rather than just apps. The Surface Laptop is clearly geared toward older students and adults. Panay even took time to note that the laptop is built to last throughout college students’ careers and beyond. “This is where we wanted to put our focus,” he said. “In the next four years of their magical lives.” Still, the Surface Laptop’s $999 starting price is far more expensive than any Chromebook you can buy. Which puts it out of range for most school districts. To ensure it can still compete in terms of price, Microsoft’s manufacturing partners — including Acer, ASUS, Dell, HP, Samsung and Toshiba — will sell Windows 10 S-powered devices starting at $189, which is comparable to most Chromebooks. Those devices will be geared more toward school districts to be used in classrooms by both students and teachers. Windows 10 S So what does Windows 10 S have to offer? A streamlined version of Microsoft’s full Windows 10 operating system, Windows 10 S will only run apps available through Microsoft’s Windows App Store. Of course, if teachers or students want to download apps from outside the App Store, they can install Windows 10 Pro on their devices through the App Store for free. Microsoft will also include a free subscription to Office 365, which features Excel, Powerpoint and Word. Office 365 also includes Microsoft’s Teams for the classroom, which allows students and teachers to collaborate and chat about projects in an environment that educators can easily police. Microsoft’s system management tools can also let administrators set usage limits for all Windows 10 S devices district wide. What’s more, logging into Windows 10 S devices takes about half the time it does to launch a full Windows 10 Pro device, 15 seconds versus 30 seconds, because the Windows 10 S notebook is running fewer apps at launch. Microsoft’s Terry Myerson announces the company’s new Windows 10 S operating system.More Read More Microsoft is also bringing mixed reality and 3D to Windows 10 S with its View Mixed Reality app and mixed reality devices from manufacturers like Acer. Of course, Microsoft is also providing schools with a one-year subscription to “Minecraft: Education Edition,” which will allow students to build environments based on their daily lessons.

Ransomware is a form of malware that completely encrypts your PC. The only way to get the key to unlock your photos, documents and music is to erase your hard drive or pay a ransom. Apple’s Macs aren’t affected by the WannaCry 2.0 ransomware, but it can be impacted by similar malware.More This particular type of ransomware is only affecting Windows computers, but that doesn’t mean Apple’s (AAPL) Macs and MacBooks are immune from these types of attacks. See, contrary to popular belief, Apple’s desktops and laptops aren’t inherently safer than those running Microsoft’s (MSFT) Windows operating systems. Yes, WannaCry 2.0 does exploit a vulnerability in older versions of Windows, but Microsoft issued a patch to deal with the problem well before this malware exploded across the web. Windows is hurt by its popularity None of this points to Microsoft’s current operating system, Windows 10, being more susceptible to malware than Apple’s macOS or OS X. In fact, the real reason hackers and criminals attack Windows is that it’s the most popular desktop operating system in the world. “Cyber criminals are generally looking for a scenario that will maximize the return on their investment,” explained McAfee CTO Steve Grobman. “What that means is they will invest in creating a malware or ransomware campaign that they believe will generate the maximum amount of ransom payment by the victim.” One of the key elements to a successful ransomware attack is the use of social engineering to trick victims into downloading infected files in dubious emails. This is the screen you’ll see if your computer is infected with the WannaCry 2.0 ransomware.More To sucker enough people into doing that, though, criminals have to cast an incredibly wide net. And since Windows is far more popular in the world than Apple’s OS X and macOS, hackers go after Microsoft’s operating system. “Given that the vast majority of deployed platforms in corporate environments are Windows, there is a lot of attention on looking for exploitation vectors of the Windows platform,” Grobman explained. In other words, if Apple’s macOS and OS X were as popular as Windows, we’d see a heck of a lot more malware designed to attack Apple’s machines. We’re only human Vulnerabilities like the one used in the WannaCry ransomware are the result of human error when developing an operating system. Humans, like you and me, are notoriously fallible and are the ones who build and program operating systems like Windows. Companies like Microsoft and Apple continually work to find these vulnerabilities before criminals can exploit them. But with millions and millions of lines of code to comb through, it’s nearly impossible to find every issue. What’s more, each update to an operating system can introduce new vulnerabilities that didn’t exist beforehand. Apple does have one advantage over Microsoft when it comes to issues like malware: it builds both its own software and hardware. That means that if Apple finds an issue with a piece of firmware for its MacBooks or Macs it can provide an update that addresses it. Microsoft’s software is installed on machines built by a slew of companies including Acer, ASUS, Dell, HP and others. Each of those organizations might have their own firmware that can be exploited that would need to be fixed with Microsoft’s help. So no, Apple’s MacBooks and Macs aren’t more secure than Windows-powered machines. If you’re running a new operating system and are sure to keep it properly updated, your Windows and Apple laptops and desktops will be equally secure.

You do it, I do it, everybody does it. And now Google (GOOG, GOOGL) wants to get in on your TV time with its new YouTube TV streaming service. Available in select cities for $35 a month, YouTube TV promises 40 channels of live TV including the five major broadcast channels: ABC, CBS, CW, FOX and NBC. Google, though, is entering an increasingly crowded market with a wide variety of different channel offerings that can be difficult to parse when all you want to do is watch “The Bachelor” and eat your KFC $20 Fill-Up in your comfy chair. But since I care so much, I’m breaking down each of the major over-the-top cable streaming services so you can get back to watching the rose ceremony. Still, not all over-the-top services offer the same channels. YouTube TV is missing Turner and Viacom properties. Sony’s (SNE) PlayStation Vue is also missing Viacom channels, while Dish’s (DISH) Sling TV and AT&T’s (T) DirecTV Now don’t offer CBS. That said, at least one of these options could be right for you. YouTube TV View photos We’ve been waiting a long time for Google’s big TV play and it’s officially here. YouTube TV features 40 channels and gets you everything from the major broadcast channels to a huge array of sports stations. In fact, YouTube TV gives you 13 sports channels and the option to add on Fox Soccer Plus. Outside of that, you get Fox News, MSNBC, Disney, National Geographic, Bravo, USA, FX and E!, among others. Google says it will add AMC and BBC World News to its lineup in the near future. You can also add Showtime for $11 a month extra. But YouTube TV has some drawbacks. First off, the service doesn’t carry Turner properties like CNN, TBS, TNT and, importantly for me, Cartoon Network. You also don’t get Viacom channels like MTV or Comedy Central. What’s worse, there doesn’t appear to be an option to add on HBO just yet, only Showtime. What’s more, YouTube TV isn’t available for Roku streaming devices or Apple TV. To address that, Google will provide you with a free Chromecast so you can stream your favorite shows to your big-screen. Still, if you’re a Roku or Apple TV user, that means having to bounce between those devices and your Chromecast just to watch different channels, which can be annoying. Sony PlayStation Vue View photos Sony’s PlayStation Vue is the Japanese tech giant’s over-the-top streaming play and it’s actually a quality offering. Rather than a one-size-fits-all offering, Sony offers four different packages depending on the number of channels you want to watch and how much you want to pay each month. The base offering, which starts at $40 per month, gets you 49 channels including ABC, CBS, FOX and NBC, as well as CNN, Fox News, MSNBC, ESPN and ESPN 2, FS1 and FS2 and a slew of others. Oh, and Cartoon Network. Sony’s $45 package gets you more than 60 channels, while the $55 package gets you more than 90 channels. Then there’s the $75 option, which includes the NFL Network and HBO. Sony, however, recently did away with Viacom content like Comedy Central. So if you’re trying to watch the “Daily Show,” you’re out of luck. Vue is available on a number of devices including, naturally, Sony’s PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4, web browsers, Apple TV, Roku, Amazon’s (AMZN) Fire TV and your mobile devices. If you’re already a PlayStation fan, Vue is a solid choice. Read More Sling TV View photos Dish’s Sling TV offers three packages Orange, Blue and Orange + Blue with a host of additional add-ons to customize your viewing options. The Orange package costs $20 per month and gets you 30 channels including ESPN, AMC, CNN, TBS, Comedy Central, Travel Channel and, of course, Cartoon Network. What you don’t get are the basic broadcast channels like ABC, CBS, FOX, NBC or the CW. The Blue package costs $25 per month and gets you 45 channels including FOX and NBC. The Orange + Blue package, which costs $40 per month, gets you 50 channels. Here’s the thing, though — you can add a range of different channels to any of the three packages. For instance, the New Extra add-on gets you MSNBC, BBC World News and Headline News for $5. Comedy Plus Extra, also $5, gets you MTV, Spike, MTV2 and CMT, which means you can watch “Steve Austin’s Broken Skull Challenge,” the greatest show on television. Curiously, Sling doesn’t include CBS. So “Big Bang Theory” fans, you know who you are, won’t be able to watch their favorite show. Sling TV is available on most mainstream TV streaming devices including Apple TV, Roku and Amazon’s Fire TV players, as well as Apple, Android and Amazon phones and tablets, Mac and Windows computers and Microsoft’s Xbox One. Unfortunately, you can’t watch Sling TV on your PlayStation. If you’re the kind of person who wants greater control over what channels you pay for, Sling TV is the way to go. AT&T DirecTV Now View photos Like Sling TV, AT&T’s DirecTV Now allows you to purchase different packages of channels based on what you want to want and how much you want to pay each month. The base offering starts at $35 per month and gets you more than 60 channels including ABC, NBC and FOX, but not CBS and the CW. You also get CNN, Fox News, MSNBC, ESPN, Disney, Cartoon Network and Comedy Central. The $50 option gets you more than 80 channels, while the $60 package gets more than 100. The largest option is the $70 package, which gives you more than 120 channels, enough to keep you on your couch for quite some time. You can subscribe to HBO GO as part of your package for an additional fee. AT&T lets you watch DirecTV Now on your Amazon Fire TV, Apple TV, Android phone and tablet, iPad and iPhone, Chromecast and web browsers. But you can’t watch it on your Chromecast with the iOS app, your Roku or Xbox One. As with YouTube TV, DirecTV Now gives you a streaming device, in this case a Fire TV stick, with your first month’s payment.

Tech News | 16 May 2017 | Print  | Comment (7) New CMD-D Conference Targets Automation by Adam C. Engst Well, this is exciting — the Apple world has a new conference dedicated to automation on 9 August 2017 in Santa Clara, California. CMD-D offers a packed 13-hour day of sessions on many aspects of scripting and automation. For those new to automation, there’s an optional Scripting Boot Camp on the day before, 8 August 2017 (more details on that will be forthcoming). The conference is organized by Mr. Automation himself, Sal Soghoian, with help from Macworld Expo producer Paul Kent and PR veteran Naomi Pearce. It’s sponsored by the Omni Group and Apple device management firm JAMF. The speakers lined up so far are top-notch, which I would say even if they weren’t all friends. Sal knows more about Apple automation than anyone, and he’ll be talking about power features of AppleScript, AppleScriptObj-C, and JavaScript for Automation that even most experts don’t know. John Welch has been in the admin trenches for longer than I can imagine and will be talking about when automation is a must and when not to bother. Jon Pugh was one of the original members of the AppleScript team and will be talking about how AppleScript was created. Andy Ihnatko… well, everyone knows Andy, and he is slated to discuss automation as a martial art practiced against “tedious, repetitive work.” And finally, Jason Snell, who has become one of the premiere podcasters in the Apple world after leaving Macworld, will be hosting a live Six Colors podcast session with the speakers on the present and future of automation. Other sessions include a deep dive into Automator, automation’s role in managing hundreds or thousands of iOS devices, how to use the Apple-acquired Workflow to automate tasks in iOS, an introduction to the Omni Group’s cross-platform scripting solution for their apps, and even an open-mic automation slam for attendees to share their most impressive solutions while competing for an award. I hope it’s a big shiny gear. CMD-D will take place in the Santa Clara Convention Center, which is near the San Jose International Airport and not far from the airports in both San Francisco and Oakland. You can register independently for the CMD-D conference and the Scripting Boot Camp for $295, or sign up for both for $590. That’s early bird pricing, which is good through the middle of June; after that, each day’s fee goes up to $395 and the two-day pass increases to $790. Lunch and afternoon snacks are included.   PDFpen and PDFpenPro 9 add 100+ enhancements to improve your PDF editing experience, with annotations, Tables of Contents, and more export options. For PDF reviewing, editing, signing, redacting and exporting, PDFpen has you covered. <http://smle.us/pdfpen9-tb>   Comments about New CMD-D Conference Targets Automation To leave a comment, click Add a Comment and then enter the text, your name, and your email address (which won't be displayed).

Receive comments via RSS Add a comment Richard Fairbanks  2017-05-17 02:40 I (and many others) really wanted Apple to adopt Hamish Sanderson’s SwiftAutomation for 10.13, but apparently not enough people responded (or Apple is still addicted to its “not-invented-here” dogma). Hamish’s AppScript was an inspirational start, and SwiftAutomation would have been a long-held dream come true. Apple’s (Sal’s?) choice to use JavaScript for system-level automation was a new low point, among many, going back decades. (How many people remember WestCode Software’s OneClick?) Apple continues to slowly and methodically “dumb down the herd.” These are very dark days for Mac system-level automation; that Hamish is not a speaker at CMD-D is a glaring omission. Adam, for decades, I have had great respect and appreciation for you and your crew!, but this page is just hype over a dying carcass. Blessings to you, Tonya, and to everyone at TidBITS! Reply has  2017-05-19 13:38 Appreciate the sentiment, although I'm not a fan of current US Border policy of Free Cavity Searches For All, so would not be attending anyway, even if Sal did have the basic courtesy and professionalism to send me an invite. (Which he does not.) Please do not rag on JavaScript though. Whatever its faults as a language, by dint of canny placement and power of network effect it is neverthelss THE MOST POPULAR and widespread language IN THE WORLD! A first-class JS-AE bridge could have tapped up to a MILLION EXISTING JS USERS on macOS alone and turned them into a VAST NEW MARKET for MacAutomation OVERNIGHT! I can only imagine the WebKit team were more than a little miffed when management took their thrilling new (if mediocre to us) JavaScriptCore project off them and handed to Sal’s team to run straight into the ground. Cos I know how I felt after 6 weeks of work desperately trying to help them make JXA be that success, only for Sal to throw all that investment back in my face. Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-19 15:03 Folks, let's avoid the personal invective. No one owes anyone anything by default, and everything is far more complicated on the inside than it seems from the outside. Reply Richard Fairbanks  2017-05-19 15:57 Adam, that you were gracious enough to allow my post in the first place speaks volumes about your (and your team’s) integrity. Your long-established and highly respected stature in the Mac community is well-earned. However . . . When a company (Apple Computer) hoards hundreds of billions of dollars, nothing “is far more complicated on the inside.” Certainly, we should be grateful that we may (finally!) be getting an upgrade to HFS+. Let us pray that Apple considers user data also worthy of checksums. But those of us “who are crazy enough to think that they can change the world” and have devoted our lives to that end, have not been treated with much respect by a company that now focusses primarily on making gadgets for social networking. You know very well, Adam, that I am not alone in this sentiment! Bless you, Brother (and to you too, Hamish!!). Reply has  2017-05-19 16:24 Adam, I’ve nothing against Sal on a personal level—I don’t know Sal the person. I do have everything against him as Automation Product Manager—a role he proved hopelessly unfit for. If he didn’t want me calling out his faults in public he should’ve accepted/declined my advice & expertise with grace & attitude back when I was offering it in private. You don’t see me treating others badly for calling me out on my own errors—it’s the highest form of complement when they take the time and effort to explain exactly why and where you’re screwing up and how to put it right. OF COURSE Apple owes us nothing—we’re only customers. We can choose to buy a product or not. But millions—no, BILLIONS—of users are being casually stripped of the rights to control & shape their own tools, while the one person IN THE WORLD best positioned to change this ACCELERATES IT INSTEAD, all cos he can’t rise past his own ego. Sorry I’m techy, but these stakes are 7 BILLION times bigger than you, me, or Sal’s feels. Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-19 16:52 I have nothing against criticism of Apple when it's deserved (and we do it all the time), but I can guarantee that there are powerful forces inside Apple (and all other major tech companies) that are pushing and pulling policy in numerous unknown directions. What seems obvious to us from the outside could be completely untenable internally for multiple business, technical, and political reasons. I don't like it either, and it's not an excuse, just a reality that we should all keep in mind. What comes out of a large company is never the result of everyone coming together and saying "What a good idea!" There are always multiple factions, winners and losers, and the buck stops pretty high up in many of these companies. Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-19 17:11 There are always at least two sides to every story, and often many more. Regardless, this is neither the time (what's past is past, and Sal is no longer employed by Apple) nor the place (this article is about the CMD-D conference) to air personal or professional grievances. I will delete any future comments on this article that go beyond the topic of the CMD-D conference, along with anything that refers to an individual. Frankly, I'm perturbed by this entire exchange. Creating CMD-D has taken Sal and Paul and Naomi a significant amount of time and effort, and I see it as a highly positive contribution to the Apple community. I dislike having TidBITS used to distract from that. Reply To leave a comment, click Add a Comment and then enter the text, your name, and your email address (which won't be displayed).

But “Android O”—which should get a dessert-based moniker when it ships later this summer—does have a set of features that Google (GOOG, GOOGL) pitched over the first day of its I/O developer conference here. As in earlier updates, Android O brings a grab-bag of features. Some address lingering pain points in this mobile operating system, while others borrow from features Apple (AAPL) added to iOS. Another represents an overdue remedy for a problem that’s afflicted Android since its debut almost nine years ago: the zombie-like persistence of obsolete versions. And of course, there’s better emoji support. Project Treble: easing updates, we can only hope The most important part of O—a rebuilding of Android’s foundation to remove an obstacle to timely software updates—barely got a mention in the almost-two-hour keynote from Google CEO Sundar Pichai and other Googlers that opened I/O at the Shoreline Amphitheatre Wednesday. But there’s no missing the reason for its existence in the embarrassing pie chart on Google’s Android-development site showing the versions of Android in use.  As of May 2, the current Nougat release that debuted last August runs on 7.1% of all devices that had connected to the Play Store in the prior seven days. The most widely used Android release was the two-year-old Marshmallow, on 31.2% of devices. At Apple, meanwhile, 79% of iOS devices that visited the App Store on Feb. 20 ran the current iOS 10 release. Project Treble, announced in a blog post last week, aims to free chipset vendors from having to tweak the code that keeps their circuitry talking to the rest of Android. Treble will add a layer of translation code between that proprietary software and the rest of Android—the equivalent of putting a standard-size joint atop some intricate plumbing in the basement. A hardware vendor can write Treble-compliant, circuit-specific code once for a device and know that future versions of Android will understand it without further rewrites. That won’t end all Android-update holdups. As this post from Ron Amadeo at Ars Technica explains, Treble won’t stop phone vendors from shipping weird Android interfaces (hello, Samsung!) that demand their own revisions. But it’s an important step in an operating system that now runs on more than 2 billion active devices. Security and privacy The afterlife of abandoned versions of Android remains the biggest problem in Android security, but many users worry instead that they’ll pick up malware in the Play Store. In reality, that’s a vanishingly small risk compared to the odds of getting hacked after downloading an app from elsewhere, thanks to a variety of malware scans that happen in the background. Android O will add more layers of security hardening but will also make these app-safety checks visible in a Google Play Protect feature showing their status. It’s literally security theatre. As Stephanie Saad Cuthbertson, product-management director for Android, said in the keynote, “Most Android users don’t know these services come built into Android devices with Play.” But if it gets people to trust the Play Store over less-secure sources, it’ll be a worthwhile production. This update will guard against a different device threat—a runaway app killing your battery life—by imposing limits on how often apps running in the background can ask for a device’s location or make other requests of the system. If that sounds like an overdue move… it probably is. In the area of privacy, Android O will randomly assign different device IDs to apps—a small but significant change that will make it harder for a developer of multiple apps to correlate your use among them. Notifications, picture-in-picture and other interface tweaks Read More Android O will require apps to group their notifications—the little nags that pop down from the top of the screen—into “channels” that you can turn on or off. It’s meant to stop apps from being too needy; in practice, having yet another option to set may not yield much difference. You’ll also be able to snooze notifications, which may help avoid losing sight of yet another message from a friend coming in on yet another messaging app. These changes should certainly help Android’s notifications experience stay ahead of the same in iOS, where you can’t even clear all notifications unless you use a device with Apple’s Touch ID pressure-sensitive control. App icons will be able to show a different sort of notice: colored “notification dots” at the top right corner of each that indicate something’s changed. That seems a pretty clear case of Google following Apple’s lead, not that there’s anything wrong with that. A picture-in-picture option will pick up on the examples of some Android vendors by letting you watch a video clip or chat in one corner while taking notes or checking your calendar. The interface change I’m most likely to appreciate: “Smart Text Selection,” in which Android will automatically select all of a street address, phone number or other significant block of text once you start trying to pick it up. This won’t work out of the box (as I saw in a demo phone), because Android will use “on-device intelligence” to build a phone-specific model of the kinds of data you often copy and paste. By not syncing this personal data to the cloud—as Cuthbertson boasted, “without any data leaving the device”—Google borrows yet again from its neighbors at Apple. The interface tweak everybody may notice first? A new “EmojiCompat” feature that should end the stigma of an iOS user sending a new emoji that doesn’t appear correctly on Android. Goodbye, blank boxes; hello, taco and unicorn emoji.

At its I/O conference here, Google (GOOG, GOOGL) touted the progress of Accelerated Mobile Pages, an ambitious initiative to remake the mobile web into a faster, lighter and less irritating medium—yes, even the ads that help pay for it. That is a laudable effort, and the web giant has a good story to tell so far. But it also needs to address lingering concerns about its intentions. Amped up about AMP The basic idea is to take the HTML code behind every web page and strip out the cruft: over-sized images, scripts that run redundantly in the background, and other junk that contributes nothing to the reading experience. The results can be impressive—see how fast this post can pop onto your phone in AMP form? At last year’s I/O, Google news head Richard Gingras said AMP pages load four times faster and use a tenth of the data of a non-AMP page. At a Wednesday evening presentation here, AMP lead Malte Ubl said better compression techniques allow images on AMP pages to need half as much data as a year ago. The AMP project only debuted in October of 2015, but now Google says more than 900,000 domains serve up over 2 billion AMP pages. At a “State of the Mobile Union” keynote Wednesday afternoon, Google product-management vice president Rahul Roy-Chowdhury noted recent support for the format by Twitter (TWTR) and China’s social-media platforms Weibo and Tencent. Tumblr, owned by this site’s parent firm Yahoo (YHOO), is joining them. There are sound reasons for this. While AMP wouldn’t exist without Google’s backing, it’s an open-source project that anybody else can use and revise—unlike proprietary fast-mobile-web efforts at Facebook (FB) and Apple (AAPL), Instant Articles and Apple News, that allow less flexibility. The British newspaper the Guardian recently dropped both Instant Articles and Apple News because they didn’t help it convince readers to sign up for paid memberships. “We’re bullish,” e-mailed Jason Kint, CEO of online-publishing trade group Digital Content Next. “Google AMP is a very promising as a strategy to protect the open web from the suffocation of Facebook’s closed platform business model.”   Address angst Kint, however, voiced wariness about how Google can push AMP pages before others, even if they may be svelte in their own right. Its mobile news search displays AMP pages first in a carousel of thumbnail previews you can easily flip through. “Google Search on mobile nearly requires participation in AMP if you want to be discovered,” he noted. An optional AMP feature yields another complication: a Google caching service that delivers pages even faster leaves them appearing at a google.com or ampproject.org address that can confuse users. For instance, my post about the upcoming Android O release appears not at the usual finance.yahoo.com domain name but at a much longer address that starts with “www.google.com/amp/s/www.yahoo.com.” At a Wednesday evening presentation, Google representatives acknowledged this frustration and said AMP pages served from the company’s cache now include a banner with the correct address, which you can tap and hold to copy for sharing elsewhere. Google is also moving to revise that cached address so it starts with the domain name of the original site—yahoo.ampproject.org, for instance. And publishers may have other options: In January, the web-hosting company CloudFlare announced its own AMP caching service and said it’s working on ways to keep pages at the right address. Mobile ads you may not hate Read More A presentation Thursday morning covered another aspect of AMP you may not want to admit to appreciating: less annoying ads. Google software engineer Michael Kleber explained how AMP ads can’t move around on a page or block its content, can’t hold up the rest of the page from loading, and can’t play video automatically. They also must run in a “sandbox” that quarantines any hostile code and can be closed by the page if it bogs down everything. This doesn’t limit AMP ads to being simple banners. A demo showed how this stripped-down code can allow for an ad in which the content changes as you scroll down the page, highlighting various parts of a car. Kleber also cited studies showing that AMP ads get seen and clicked through more. He cited a series of ads from the firm TripleLift on Time, Inc. (TIME) sites that were three times lighter and six times faster to load than non-AMP versions, and which generated 13% more revenue. As somebody who writes for a variety of ad-supported sites, that sounds pretty good. But remember that the AMP spec doesn’t ban ads that are light, efficient and repellent. You can use this format to crank out sleazy “around the web” clickbait ads (if you want to make your eyes bleed, read Amanda Hess’s New York Times recap of clicking through dozens of them) and spam people with creepy “retargeting” ads trying to get them to complete purchases contemplated on other sites. AMP also can’t force desktop sites to shape up their act, even if well-done AMP sites start to make them look like hot garbage in comparison. Memo to web designers and publishers: Mobile users aren’t the only people online who don’t want their time or bandwidth wasted.

The woman, who wishes to remain anonymous, was sleeping on a flight from Beijing to Melbourne when she was woken up by the sound of an explosion and a burning sensation on her face. The woman’s face, hands, and hair were burned, and she sought compensation from Apple for the replacement of the headphones and clothing which was ruined as a result of the incident. In a statement released by the woman’s lawyers, an Apple representative stated that the investigation “indicated the issue was caused by a third-party battery.” The woman had purchased a standard set of AAA batteries in Australia, and noted that she was extremely disappointed with Apple’s decision as the headphones require batteries, however Apple does not specify a specific brand of batteries anywhere on the headphones or their packaging.

An update to Ford's infotainment system will bring Android Auto and Apple CarPlay to all of its 2016 model year cars, the automaker announced on Friday. The software update, which can be installed via USB, at a dealer, or over the air for cars equipped with Wi-Fi or cellular antennas, means that more Ford owners will have access to the in-dash versions of iOS and Android. Instead of relying on their vehicle's built-in navigation system, which might be outdated, they can project Google Maps onto their car's in-dash display, for instance. And Android Auto and CarPlay offer many more features besides navigation, from access to streaming music to the ability—via CarPlay only—to talk to Siri, Apple's personal voice assistant. Both platforms work by projecting a modified version of your phone's operating system onto the in-dash display. The icons are bigger, and there's no access to text messages or other features that might distract drivers. Related No CarPlay or Android Auto? Navdy to the Rescue No CarPlay or Android Auto? Navdy to the Rescue The Android Auto and CarPlay update is the first time that Ford is offering a new software version via Wi-Fi. That means all you have to do to receive it is park your Wi-Fi-equipped car within range of a designated Wi-Fi network—your garage might work, depending on how close it is to your router—and the car will automatically check for and download the update as if it were a smartphone or computer. There is one additional, potentially pricey step you'll need to take if you want to use CarPlay, however: Ford says CarPlay support requires a USB hub upgrade from a Ford dealership. Meanwhile, if you have a Ford vehicle from the 2017 model year, or one of hundreds of other 2017 and 2016 model year cars from other automakers, you've already got Android Auto and CarPlay built in. You can check for your specific model on the Android Auto or CarPlay compatibility lists, which as of Friday afternoon haven't yet been updated to reflect 2016 Fords.

The vulnerabilities used have already been fixed in iOS 10.3.2 but the exploit could lead to a jailbreak for iOS 10.3.1 (10.2 as well). Apple fixed 8 kernel privilege escalation bugs I sent them. A privilege escalation exploit is already written. It will be released during conferences’ season in the summer. You may want to save SHSH blobs :) Responding to jailbreak speculation Donenfeld tweets, "I never said anything about jailbreak. I'm releasing an exploit (source code + instructions). If someone wants to take the hassle of wrapping it into a jailbreak I’d be happy to help." Here's the description of Donenfeld's presentation for HITB GSEC: --- Attackers have been lurking around iOS in the hope of achieving a full attack-chain to the device. Following Apple’s introduction of self-signed applications, the attack surface for containerized applications on iOS is pretty constant. Apple is doing a good job in improving its security, from narrowing down the attack surface to introducing new mitigations, both from a software and a hardware perspective. As a side effect of these efforts, most of the attack surface that is not accessible by a containerized application is often ignored. With this in mind, we decided to examine code that is not accessible by default to the common containerized app, but to any other process - regardless of its security context. We were surprised to see that what is not accessible from the initial code execution context needs much more attention. During our research, we found multiple privilege escalation vulnerabilities affecting all iOS devices in the market. In this presentation, we will review the privilege escalation vulnerabilities, as well as demonstrate and present a detailed exploitation that is crafted from chaining all these vulnerabilities together, eventually leading to the execution of arbitrary kernel code and to bypassing all of the security mitigations currently available on iOS devices. --- Please follow iClarified on Twitter, Facebook, Google+, or RSS for news of further developments.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Apps & Software Image Source: Shutterstock Apple may be playing with fire in China Yoni Heisler @edibleapple May 19th, 2017 at 4:21 PM Share Tweet When Apple released its earnings report for the March quarter, there was one data point that jumped off the page regarding iPhone sales. Although iPhone sales declined 1% year over year, Apple saw its revenue increase in every geographic region the company operates in, save for China. Specifically, Apple saw its revenue in China drop by 14% year over year, a factor widely attributed to slumping iPhone sales during the March quarter. And though the iPhone 7 Plus was more popular among Chinese consumers than Apple anticipated, Tim Cook conceded during Apple’s conference call that older generation iPhone models “didn’t perform as well.” Don't Miss: Apple’s iPhone 8 will basically bring back the headphone jack With analysts scratching their heads trying to figure out why iPhone sales in China hit a speed bump recently, Ben Thompson of Stratechery theorized that the stickiness of the iOS ecosystem is less of a factor in China than it is anywhere else in the world. The reason, interestingly enough, stems from the popularity of an app called WeChat. The fundamental issue is this: unlike the rest of the world, in China the most important layer of the smartphone stack is not the phone’s operating system. Rather, it is WeChat. Connie Chan of Andreessen Horowitz tried to explain in 2015 just how integrated WeChat is into the daily lives of nearly 900 million Chinese, and that integration has only grown since then: every aspect of a typical Chinese person’s life, not just online but also off is conducted through a single app (and, to the extent other apps are used, they are often games promoted through WeChat). For all intents and purposes WeChat is your phone, and to a far greater extent in China than anywhere else, your phone is everything. In other words, the headaches that might ordinarily accompany switching between Android and iOS are far less common in China because WeChat trumps whatever mobile platform a user might be using to engage with WeChat. As a result, some have even likened WeChat to a de-facto operating system in its own right due to how popular it is and the myriads of functions it houses. All that said, a new rule from Apple as it pertains to tipping on the WeChat app has struck some as risky and perhaps ill-timed. According to a report from The Wall Street Journal, Apple recently told social media apps that operate in China, including WeChat, that the company will soon start taking a 30% cut from all “tipping” activity that occurs within the app. Incidentally, in the Chinese market, it’s not uncommon for users to send monetary tips to developers and content providers when they appreciate an app’s services. Apple views this as an in-app purchase whereas Chinese developers disagree and instead view this behavior as a voluntary token of appreciation. One executive says his company is talking to the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, a regulator, about whether Apple is imposing unfair rules by turning tipping into in-app purchases. MIIT says it isn’t involved. The People’s Bank of China, which regulates electronic payments, didn’t respond to a request for comment. With iPhone sales in China not exactly on the rise, it will be interesting to see which side here blinks first.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Apps & Software Image Source: Apple A look at 100 awesome iOS 11 features we hope Apple introduces at WWDC Yoni Heisler @edibleapple May 19th, 2017 at 3:17 PM Share Tweet WWDC is now just about two weeks away and Apple has done an unusually solid job of keeping upcoming iOS 11 features under wraps. Still, it’s not as if Apple has been able to prevent any iOS 11 rumors from leaking out. Over the past few months, for example, we’ve seen indications that iOS 11 will feature enhanced Siri functionality, support for multi-user video chatting in FaceTime, peer-to-peer payments via Apple Pay, a Dark Mode option, smarter battery management software, and improved call quality. We even saw one sketchy rumor claiming that iOS 11 will alert a user when someone else takes a screenshot of an iMessage conversation. Now that’s all well and good, and even if we assume that all of the above rumors pan out, it’s a safe bet that iOS 11 will introduce a plethora of additional features designed to improve system performance and, more than anything, enhance the overall user experience. With a scarcity of iOS 11 rumors at our disposal, the EverythingApplePro YouTube channel recently put out a video highlighting an all-encompassing iOS 11 feature wish list. What makes the video remarkably impressive and engaging is that the vast majority of the suggested iOS 11 features are actually clever, intuitive, and user-friendly. Don't Miss: Exclusive: The world’s first look at Apple’s final iPhone 8 design in real life The entire video is well worth watching in its entirety, but a few of the suggested features that struck a chord with me include: more control over what appears in the Control Center, a volume toggle that doesn’t obstruct the display when turning the sound up or down, a numbered-key row above the stock keyboard, the ability to pause and re-start a recording without creating a new video, and a more useful one-handed mode than what Reachability provides. All in all, the video below is without question one of the most thoughtfully crafted and extensive iOS wish lists we’ve ever seen. And far from focusing on fantastical features that are either impractical or impossible to pull off, the suggested iOS 11 features below are completely reasonable for Apple to incorporate. For as advanced as iOS has become, the following video demonstrates that iOS still a lot of room left for improvement.

The revelation adds weight to a previous report from CNBC, which said last month that Apple has hired a team of biomechanical engineers to develop a noninvasive device to monitor the blood sugar levels of people with diabetes. Quotes in the article Apple Inc AAPL ▲ 153.06 +0.52 +0.34% Citing unnamed sources, CNBC reports that Apple’s Palo Alto-based team has already begun feasibility tests with the tracker, which connects to the Apple Watch. Glucose trackers currently on the market use sensors that penetrate the skin. Cook told students at the University of Glasgow in February that he had been wearing a glucose tracker, and that it helped him understand the impact of different foods on his blood sugar levels.  "It's mentally anguishing to stick yourself many times a day to check your blood sugar," Cook said, according to CNBC. "There is lots of hope out there that if someone has constant knowledge of what they're eating, they can instantly know what causes the response... and that they can adjust well before they become diabetic." More than 29 million Americans suffer from diabetes, according to recent figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Among those who have the disease, one in four are unaware of their condition, according to the CDC. Steve Jobs envisioned using wearables to monitor blood sugar and other vital signs during his tenure as Apple CEO, and the company’s glucose tracker has been in development for at least five years, CNBC reported last month. But developing an accurate and noninvasive technique has proven challenging. Speaking to CNBC last month, biomedical expert John L. Smith said developing such a device has been “the most difficult technical challenge I have encountered in my career.” Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

Introduction and design 2. Performance, features and verdict Our Verdict An aesthetically pleasing machine that won’t break the bank. If you can get over the so-so battery life then you might be looking at your next office workhorse. For All aluminium body Backlit keys Wonderful screen Fast to wake up and use Against Bendy keyboard Meh battery life Small hard drive Introducing the Asus UX310UA. A laptop that’s pretty much the same size, price and weight as Apple’s recently updated, and dearly loved MacBook Air.  And with the Air having being cast out as the, pardon the pun, bad apple of the laptop family, is Asus ready to wear the coveted Air crown?  Nearly, ever so nearly. A large diamond encrusted tiara would be more fitting. Spec Sheet CPU: Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-7200U CPU @ 2.50GHz running 2.7GHz Graphics: Intel(R) HD Graphics 620 RAM: 8GB, DDR4, 2,133MHz. Expandable to 20GB Screen: 13.3 inch, 3,200 x 1,800 QHD Storage: 256GB SSD Ports: 1 x COMBO audio jack, 1 x USB 3.1 TYPE C port, 1 x USB 3.0 port, 2 x USB 2.0 port, 1 x HDMI Camera: HD Web Camera Weight: 1.4kg / 3.09 pounds Size: 32.3 cm x 22.3 cm x 1.84cm / 12.7 x 8.78 x 0.72 inches (W x D x H) Design First up, the Asus Zenbook UX310UA, like its previous incarnation the UX303UA, is incredibly pretty, arguably better looking than Apple’s spurned masterpiece.  Marvel at the shining concentric circles emanating from the Asus logo on the lid, gasp at the smooth lines around the edge, and your wallet will be a little more plump thanks to the free carry case. That’d be an extra cost from Apple. So far so good.  Sizing it up to the competition, it’s mostly on par. It’s a little thicker than the Macbook Air which is 1.7cm, while this is 1.84cm and admittedly doesn’t have the tapered end.  Lenovo’s Ideapad 710S is similarly specced and thinner but has a poorer display. HP’s Spectre x360 is also slimmer but its starting price is £1,199 ($1,049, AU$2,299).  In order to keep the price low, Asus has increased the thickness, but kept the build quality high. A fair compromise we think. Before you’ve even turned it on, the packaging is elegant. Unlike a lot of laptops, this one is worthy of an unboxing video. Upon opening the lid, the simple message “In Search Of Incredible” is emblazoned on the inner lid, which is a nice touch. There’s a distinct lack of plastic and cable ties too. Of course the Macbook Air wins out power wise as it’s one of the few machines that still use the brilliant MagSafe charger, here though it’s a perfectly serviceable L-shaped plug. Speaking of plugs, the Zenbook isn’t short of sockets. Along the left side you’ll find the aforementioned round charging socket, a USB 3.0, HDMI, USB C and headphone with integrated microphone socket.  On the right there are two USB 2.0 ports, an SD card reader and a couple of lights, one for the hard drive and the other that let you know that it’s actually on, or if the battery is charging. It’s a pity that the two USBs on the right aren’t 3.0 like the one on the left, but it’s handy that there’s a USB C port included. Incidentally the USB 3.0 port on the left supports USB Charger +, an Asus invention that charges external equipment quickly even while it’s off or hibernating. There’s bundled software included that’ll help manage the laptop’s battery when using this facility.  Screen and interface As well as being a looker, the Asus Zenbook UX310UA also sports a fantastic screen. We were given the QHD 3,200 x 1,800 version to review, but it’s also available with a full HD 1920x1080 resolution screen as well. And my word is it a glory to behold. Viewable from a wide range of angles (178 to be precise) and the Anti-Glare actually does what it’s meant to do.  There is very little edge burn when the screen’s entirely black and the colors are well-defined, deep and avoid looking garish. This screen could work for photographers on the move because of its wonderful color definition.  And, if we go back to the Macbook Air comparison, at the same price point you most definitely wouldn't be getting a Retina screen. If we have one criticism, the bezel is a little large, but it’s not too obtrusive. At first we thought the keyboard wasn’t up to scratch, as typing causes a slightly disorientating bend in the center. However, the bend isn’t a detriment to the usability, as once we got used to it, it’s a perfectly functioning mechanism with low noise and reliable keys. But you may need give it time to adjust if you're used to rock-solid keyboards. Similarly with the trackpad, it took a bit of setup and getting used to. The pinch zoom doesn’t really work, as it would often get set off while using two finger scrolling.  In the end we had to turn off the zoom and just use keyboard shortcuts. Not an ideal solution, but we prefer to be able to use two finger scroll and can do without pinch zoom. The pad itself feels a little slippery compared with others. But again, this is not a deal breaker and these niggles are fixable. 1 2 Current page: Introduction and design Next Page Performance, features and verdict Tech deals, prizes and latest news Get the best tech deals, reviews, product advice, competitions, unmissable tech news and more!

Cook was spotted using a glucose monitor at the new Apple Campus in Cupertino, according to a CNBC source. Sadly there are no photos but the source reportedly said that the glucose monitor was physically attached to Cook's Apple Watch in some way. Last month, CNBC reported that Apple has a 30-person team in Palo Alto quietly working on non-invasive and continuous glucose monitoring — something that would be welcomed by the millions of diabetes sufferers worldwide who currently have to draw blood to get a glucose reading. It's likely that any non-invasive glucose monitoring hardware would comprise of one or more sensors that could be built into a product like the Apple Watch or even sit as a standalone device. However, the Apple Watch seems like the most likely candidate at this stage. Earlier this week, tech website BGR published a report that said Apple will introduce a "game-changing glucose monitoring feature in an upcoming Apple Watch," citing a source familiar with the matter. In February, Cook spoke about his personal interest in glucose monitors as he collected an honorary degree from the University of Glasgow. "I've been wearing a continuous glucose monitor for a few weeks," he said at the time. "I just took it off before coming on this trip." Unfortunately, Cook did not specify whether the device he had been wearing was an Apple prototype or a device created by another manufacturer but he did say that glucose monitor had enabled him to monitor his blood sugar levels and adjust his diet accordingly Apple's plans in the space could be quite far along. Indeed, the iPhone maker is already conducting feasibility trials for a glucose monitoring device in the San Francisco Bay Area, according to CNBC sources. Apple does not typically comment on rumours such as this one.

As of yesterday, four new tutorial videos have been added to the site, including how to shoot a horizon, how to capture an intimate moment, how to convert to black and white, and how to shoot with zoom on the iPhone 7 Plus. All four can be watched on Apple's tutorial site, but the latter two are also available on YouTube. Apple has 20 tutorial videos on its "How to Shoot on iPhone 7" website, and the company is slowly uploading each of the videos to YouTube. 13 of the 20 videos can be watched on Apple's YouTube channel. New YouTube additions include how to shoot a one-handed selfie and how to edit a selfie, two videos previously exclusively available on the tutorial site. Apple's videos are designed to teach iPhone 7 and 7 Plus users how to use the iPhone camera to capture various kinds of photos, including panoramas, portraits, action shots, night shots, and more. Each of the videos is approximately 40 seconds in length and includes a clear step-by-step tutorial on how to use each feature. Most of the videos are simple and straightforward, designed for people who don't often use the camera and haven't invested a lot of time in learning its features, but there are some neat tips and tricks that even more advanced users might find useful, like capturing a unique angle, shooting with a street light, capturing stills while filming, and more.

Rating: 2 Votes ck2875 11 hours ago at 01:17 pm After 3 years, I'm still locking the iPhone instead of taking a picture. Ridiculous design all for the sake of f*cking Ive symmetry. iOS didn't even have the Volume-to-Shutter button idea for the camera until Camera+ by tap tap tap went around Apple's APIs and created their own to accomplish this ('https://www.engadget.com/2010/08/12/camera-pulled-from-app-store-for-volume-button-as-camera-shutt/'), which caused Apple to remove the app from the app store in late 2010. Then Apple added an api for it in 2011 for iOS 5 ('//www.macrumors.com/2011/10/13/ios-5-camera-volume-shutter-lock-screen-remote-triggering/'). So we have to be fair to Ive here: He's only had 5 years of iPhone releases to fix this annoyance that first appeared 2 years after Apple got on board with the concept of allowing the volume button to act as a manual shutter button. How quickly do you expect him to fix design issues that shouldn't have ever been an issue to begin with? /s Rating: 1 Votes [ Read All Comments ] Upcoming MacBook Pro June 2017 Minor update to latest Kaby Lake processors expected at WWDC.

The company apparently started in the March/April window with 500,000 units a month, and has now bumped that up to 600,000. 10.5-inch iPad Pro production ramps up ahead of WWDC Insider sources speaking with DigiTimes said production for the 10.5-inch iPad Pro should hit 600,000 a month by July. Apple still hasn’t officially announced the device, but with production underway it’s likely that’ll come soon. Rumors claim Apple has a 10.5-inch version of the iPad Pro in the works, and it may be unveiled at the company’s Worldwide Developer Conference in early June. Earlier rumors pegged the launch event in April, but that came and went without any news from Apple. The new iPad size is expected to help boost sales, but analysts are still projecting year-over-year sales to drop. The 12.9-inch iPad Pro is expected to get some love this year, too. Apple may be planning on starting production in June with a release in the third quarter. This will mark the first upgrade for the 12.9-inch model since it was introduced in September 2015. We won’t likely hear about a 12.9-inch iPad Pro refresh at WWDC, but we could see the new 10.5-inch model. Reports also say Apple is unveiling new iMac models and a Siri-based Amazon Echo competitor at the event. If Apple is launching updated iMacs and an iPad, along with entering into the voice assistant appliance market, that’ll make for a rushed keynote—or one that’s really long. Along with those rumored devices, Apple is going to show off the next major versions of macOS, iOS, watchOS, and tvOS. That’s a lot to pack into a 60 minute keynote event. Apple hasn’t said anything about its upcoming product announcements. With WWDC only a few weeks away, we won’t have to wait too long to see which rumors pan out.

Jeff Butts @clefmeister · +Jeff Butts 2 minute read May 19th, 2017 2:24 PM EDT | News Apple first embedded an NFC chip in the iPhone 6. Many folks have been disappointed that the capability only works with Apple Pay. When years went by without the NFC chip being unlocked, either officially or in a jailbreak, it began to seem like we’d never be able to use NFC on iPhone for more than Apple Pay. Well, that’s changing, courtesy of a jailbreak tweak. If you jailbreak your iPhone, its NFC chip will soon be a lot more useful NFC on iPhone is Another Walled Garden NFC on iPhone has been a walled garden since it first arrived. We’ve only been able to use it for Apple Pay, and some folks (myself included) were starting to think the hardware was locking out other functionality somehow. It turns out, that’s not the case. Yes, NFC on iPhone is locked down, but it’s only through software. A popular jailbreak developer, Elias Limneos, has broken through the wall. He successfully made his iPhone respond to NFC-enabled devices other than Apple Pay readers. He even posted a YouTube video of the process, because pictures or it never happened. Just NFC Tags, for Now Limneos has enabled his jailbroken iPhone to respond to NFC tags, which is a huge step in the right direction. You can see the jailbreak tweak reading the tag and authenticating it. There’s sure to be more to come, though. Android users are able to pair NFC-enabled cameras and speakers, as well as transmit files between each other. Eventually, jailbreak developers could use this functionality to open up their iPhones to pay on other NFC platforms than Apple Pay, unlock an RFID door with their iOS devices, or much more. I think, though, that this enhanced functionality of the NFC chip will remain jailbreak-only. I don’t think Apple will open up the technology to more than its payment platform, and for good reason. The Walled Garden Makes Life Easier and Faster For the average user, the walled garden behind NFC is probably a good thing. Since the chip is currently only used for Apple Pay, your iPhone responds the same way anytime it senses an NFC device nearby. It displays the Apple Pay interface. Your iPhone doesn’t have to take the time to figure out what that device is and which app to use for it. This is probably the main reason the Apple Pay experience is one of the fastest among all of the NFC payment platforms. Limiting what the NFC chip can do also makes Apple Pay more secure. You don’t have to worry about someone rigging a different NFC reader to pretend it’s the Apple Pay reader and take your hard-earned cash. So Why Hack NFC on iPhone in the First Place? As I said, the walled garden is good for the average user. For the not-so-average iPhone owner, though, more freedom is a good thing. If you’re adventurous enough to jailbreak your iPhone, opening up the NFC chip to use it in new ways is a good reward for your efforts. According to 9to5Mac, Limneous plans to release the hack as a tweak on Cydia in the near future. Others should follow suit with more functionality soon, I’m sure. [Editor’s note: Jailbroken iPhones are inherently less secure and have been targeted by malware, including criminal and state-sponsored malware. Know what you’re doing before jailbreaking your iOS devices. – Bryan] Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn Reddit More Print Tumblr Tags: Apple Pay, iPhone, jailbreaking, NFC You might also like… Get Free Bitcoins from 21 Faucets That Pay The Cloud Is a Lie - Page 2 of 3 MP3 Wasn't Killed, it was Set Free macOS: Great Wallpaper is Hidden in Your Mac's Screensaver Collection Two Easy Tips for Being More Productive on Your Mac 4 Comments Add a comment AppleTim May 19, 2017 Jeff, this entire article is wrong. NFC on iPhone has been officially available, supported, and allowed by Apple for the purposes of unlocking hotel room doors. Go check out Starwood’s keyless program, and Hilton’s Digital Key. May 19, 2017 at 5:27 EDT PM Jeff Butts May 19, 2017 Tim, on the iPhone, those features use Bluetooth, not NFC. May 19, 2017 at 5:40 EDT PM AppleTim May 19, 2017 Jeff, I thought the same, until I went to actually use Digital Key at a few Hilton Properties. Many times, the ApplePay interface on iOS would pop up during the door unlock process. It’s as if the phone thinks it’s at a pay terminal, and then asks for my TouchID to proceed. Here’s a report: https://humanizing.tech/review-of-hiltons-digital-key-to-unlock-my-hotel-room-door-515e8d305d00 I could be wrong, but it looks as if the NFC chip is involved here. May 19, 2017 at 6:45 EDT PM Jeff Butts May 19, 2017 There may be, for other devices (like Android). That behavior is precisely what is expect to happen when the iPhone’s NFC picks up a broadcast. It tries to negotiate an Apple Pay transaction. Meanwhile, Bluetooth wakes up and your Hilton Key app uses it to unlock the door. See Hilton’s FAQ for more information.

It's also packing a huge, colourful screen, and smart design aesthetics that could make it stand out from the crowd. But will all this pizazz have UK buyers leaving the Apple Stores and heading over to HTC? We compare the HTC U11 with Apple's iPhone 7 to see which one deserves your money. Also read: iPhone buying guide 2017 | Best cheap iPhone deals 2017 Design & Build quality The HTC U11 isn't a handset that's built to be subtle. The body is covered in what HTC is calling Liquid Glass, and the results are striking. The substance is made by a process that sounds like a method of enhanced interrogation in the dystopian future of a sci-fi novel: Optical Spectrum Hybrid Deposition. HTC claims that "by layering highly-reflective precious minerals across the phone's back cover, we've created stunningly vivid new colours that transform light with every movement you make." In short, it's shiny and vibrantly hued. The U11 comes in a range of colours including Ice White, Sapphire Blue, Brilliant Black, Amazing Silver and Solar Red. The iPhone 7 is no slouch in the decorative department, available as it is in Jet Black, Black, Silver, Gold, and Rose Gold. The colours can't quite match the dazzling nature of the U11, but if you want cooler tones then the iPhone is the one to go for. Curved edges adorn the sides of the U11 to create the sense that even though this is a large unit it's actually comfortable and slim in the hand. That's good because the 5.5-inch Quad-HD display does take the U11 into the bigger device bracket when compared to the iPhone 7. HTC U11: 153.9 mm x 75.9 mm x 7.9 mm; 169g iPhone 7: 138.3 mm x 67.1 mm x 7.1 mm; 138g Many people will now be familiar with the iPhone 7 chassis, as it varies very little from the iPhone 6 and 6s that preceded it. It's a solid, clean design, but those bezels are beginning to look a little dated now especially when you compare the design to something like the Samsung Galaxy S8 and its Infinity display. The 4.7-inch panel is bright, clear, and has rich colours. It's still a great phone to hold in your hand, with the smaller build making it less of a reach for every corner, but like the HTC U11 you'll probably want a case, as they're both slippery little devils. See also: Best iPhone 7 cases The HTC U11 and iPhone 7 are rated at IPV67 which means that can survive a dip in water down to depths of 1 metre, and resist dust and sand. So you can safely take either to the beach. Unless you live in England, of course, where they'd need some kind of arctic resistance. Features Both the iPhone 7 and HTC U11 have built-in features that allow users to access deeper functions in apps without having to open them first. On the iPhone side there's 3D Touch, which is a pressure-based system. Firmly hold down the icon of an app and a menu will appear. It's a useful way to speed up activities on iPhone and soon becomes something users rely on. For more details on the feature read our Best 3D Touch tips for iPhone on iOS 10. Edge Sense HTC has debuted an interesting new idea in the U11. Edge Sense allows users to squeeze the sides of the phone to execute functions. This could be launching the camera, turning on the torch, that sort of thing. At the moment there are two settings - short or long press - and these can be user defined from a list of commands in the OS. Third party support is also promised by HTC, which could make this a very cool feature. USonic Audio HTC has followed Apple's lead and omitted a headphone jack from the U11. Instead there's the USB-C charging port which doubles as a way to plug in headphones, just like the Lightning port on the iPhone. But there's one big difference between the two. In the box HTC has put a USB-C to 3.5mm adaptor (Apple also includes a dongle with the iPhone 7), but it doubles as a Digital Audio Converter (DAC) to improve the quality of the audio that reaches your ears. The U11 also comes with dedicated U-Sonic headphones that feature Active Noise Cancellation. This puts the device at the top of the heap for audiophiles who want the best sound from their phones. Apple doesn't include anything like this in the box, but the company's AirPods have proven to be a big hit with users thanks to their wireless construction and excellent sound quality. The only drawback is that they're not cheap, costing a rather hefty £159. Unplugged the U11 also boasts HTC's BoomSound Hi-Fi edition, which uses stereo speakers to project impressively detailed audio that eclipses the best efforts of the iPhone 7. Amazon Alexa While the iPhone 7 and HTC U11 both include digital assistants in their operating systems - Siri for iOS and Google Assistant for Android - the latter also is introducing support for Amazon's Alexa voice technology. How this will prove advantageous isn't exactly clear yet, so we'll need to spend some time with the U11 and report back our findings. Cameras With cameras becoming a significant selling point for smartphones now, primarily because it will be the main way people capture photos and videos, you can always expect plenty of attention being paid to the optics. HTC has gone for broke with the units on the U11 and managed to secure the highest ever DxOMark rating for a smartphone (90). This could be down to the multi-axis optical and electronic stabilisation, fast Auto HDR mode, UltraSpeed Autofocus, or just the general technology found inside the impressive 16mp shooter. Apple is equally proud of its 12mp camera which is capable of some excellent images and video. It isn't quite the showstopper of the dual-lens version found on the iPhone 7 Plus, but it's rare you'll hear users complaining that the camera on an iPhone isn't good enough. So, either handset will be more than enough for everyday use. Specs As you would expect with flagship devices the technology under the hood of either device is top notch. Both will be swift, powerful, and should last their owners for at least a few years without showing their age too much.

HTC has announced June 1st as the release date for the U11 in the UK, and pre-orders are now being taken for the device. Price You can currently buy an iPhone 7 for the following prices: £599 (32GB) £699 (128GB) £799 (256GB) The U11 (64GB) is now available to pre-order from HTC and costs £649. OUR VERDICT It’s too early to tell if the U11 is going to live up to the potential that all of its features and hardware suggest. If it does then it will be one of the most sought-after phones this summer, thanks to its high-quality camera, audio, Edge Sense feature and interesting design. For now, though, the iPhone 7 remains a proven thoroughbred that is always easy to recommend. The design is classic and the performance is permanently near or at the top of any testing metric. HTC has built something that could threaten the iPhone throne, but when you come for the king you'd better not miss. Tags: iPhone Share this article Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi.

Now, the company claims that Apple is holding onto deleted notes well past the thirty-day grace period during which they’re kept in the “Recently Deleted” folder… Spigen TEKA RA200 Airpods Earhooks Cover In a blog post, the company explains that using a version of its Phone Breaker tool, it extracted notes that were outside of the thirty-day grace period. ElcomSoft writes that its tool extracted nearly 50 notes that had been deleted by the user over a month ago. In fact, the oldest note it was able to retrieve was from 2012. What this means is that Apple is holding on to deleted notes for much longer than it should be and it’s unclear why. ElcomSoft notes that the results vary on an account-by-account basis, with some accounts returning a large number of deleted notes, while others return fewer. The company says that in order to know the full breadth of this issue, it needs a larger test base. We discovered that Apple apparently retains in the cloud copies of the users’ notes that were deleted by the user. Granted, deleted notes can be accessed on iCloud.com for some 30 days through the “Recently Deleted” folder; this is not it. We discovered that deleted notes are actually left in the cloud way past the 30-day period, even if they no longer appear in the “Recently Deleted” folder. The research and software company has made several other discoveries in the past. Earlier this year, ElcomSoft reported that iCloud was storing more Safari history than it should, and Apple quickly corrected the flaw the same day. Last year, the company discovered that it was surprisingly easy to access encrypted iTunes backups and again, Apple fixed the problem. Apple has yet to comment on today’s findings, but if it keeps pace with previous issues like this, it shouldn’t be too long before the company explains itself and/or fixes whatever is causing notes to be retrievable. When Apple comments and fixes the problem, we’ll be sure to update this post and let you know.

Apple is one of several high-profile companies that have been lobbying against a New York state bill that would make it easier to independent stores and users to repair devices. According to Motherboard, the Fair Repair Act would have companies sell replacement parts and tools to everyone, bans software locks that would limit repairs and, in some cases, have companies provide repair guides publicly. However, Apple and other companies have come out aggressively against the proposed legislation. Read: Apple Counters Nebraska’s ‘Right To Repair’ Bill With Hacking Claim; Samsung Reportedly Agrees Along with Apple, other companies who have lobbied against the Fair Repair Act include Toyota, Caterpillar and Verizon. Since the start of 2017, the companies have spent more than a combined $366,000 in New York to lobby against the legislation. According to the bill’s summary from the New York State Senate, it “requires manufacturers of digital electronic parts to offer for sale diagnostic and repair information in the same manner as such manufacturer provides such diagnostic and repair information to such manufacturer's repair channel.” In other states, companies like Apple have aggressively come out against similar repair laws. In Nebraska, Apple officials met with legislators and warned that the law could make the state a "Mecca for bad actors.” Similar laws are being debated in states including Massachusetts, Illinois and Tennessee. For companies like Apple, the push against these self-repair laws comes from several areas. By keeping their repair information and resources in-house, companies can maintain quality control for sourcing components like screen or hardware replacements. In addition, piracy is an equal concern. Farm equipment company John Deere told regulators in 2015 that repair laws would “make it possible for pirates, third-party software developers, and less innovative competitors to free-ride off the creativity, unique expression and ingenuity of vehicle software designed by leading vehicle manufacturers.” Read: Apple Planning To Contest Proposed Nebraska Legislation However, these same companies also have financial reasons to oppose similar repair bills. Often, these companies have their own repair and warranty programs that would potentially be threatened by independent or third-party shops. The lobbying fight against these types of repair bills reflects the current push and pull between consumers who want access to the devices they purchase and companies who want to maintain some security over their products. This debate hasn’t been limited to the consumer electronics space, either. As Motherboard previously reported, American farmers have frequently turned to hacks and other European third-party accessories in order to repair their John Deere tractors. Because John Deere has wanted to limit repairs to its own technicians and authorized repair shops, farmers have had to crack into their vehicles in order to do repairs they previously could freely perform.

Reuters/David Gray With most still wondering on whether an iOS jailbreak will ever come out, others continue to find ways to put older iOS jailbreak versions to good use. Jailbreak developer Elias Limneos is one of them and his efforts recently include putting Near Field Communication (NFC) to work.  Limneos demonstrated everything on video, using a jailbroken iPhone 6s interacting with an NFC-enabled tag. As shown below, the jailbreak developer was able to use the phone to interact with another device which identified the tag.  Limneos explains that he was able to do the trick with a small hack on the nfcd daemon, 9 to 5 Mac reports. The same should work with other jailbroken device that is NFC-enabled. With the breakthrough, the report further adds that the jailbreak developer is exploring other options which include reading or writing data. If successful, the efforts could open up lots of possibilities. That would include the ability of iPhone owners to open RFID doors or other solutions which rely on the technology. If not via entry points, other uses could include the transfer of data or even pay transactions.  For the record, Apple did implement NFC into the iPhone 6 as a means to facilitate Apple pay transactions. There is no official word yet for now if the Cupertino company has been notified of Limneos discovery. The same holds true on whether they have future plans to open up access to developers.  The chances of seeing Apple open up access to developers remains to be seen though it is likely that they will keep it as a primary method for Apple Pay. Knowing the things tied up to the sensitive feature, it may take some time before the Cupertino company explores further use of the NFC feature.  Speed is another issue raised, something to do with the sensing of NFC-enabled devices within an area. The iPhone may need time to properly decipher the device it discovers, causing some lag which could corrupt transactions.  The breakthrough of Limneos may not be much but a hack that some could find it handy. It does have some positives tied behind it but associating it with Apple Pay transactions may carry lots of risks. The jailbreak developer plans to share his work as an NFC-enabler tweak instead of an app. It should crop up soon at the Cydia store for jailbroken iPhone users soon.    Submit Correction 0 0 0 Related iOS 10.3.1 Jailbreak release possibly happening after iOS 10.3.2 deployment Apple iOS 10 jailbreak tool update Join the Discussion 0 0 0 Search Most Shared Most Read 1 Apple Watch can now detect cardiac arrhythmia with 97 percent accuracy 0 Shares 2 Apple Watch to reportedly have blood sugar-monitoring functionality; Camera band also a possibility 0 Shares 3 Heroin and cocaine addicts receiving the marijuana touch 0 Shares 4 ‘Outlander’ season 3: ‘Better than first two seasons’ 0 Shares 5 ‘Outlander’ season 3: ‘Out of this world performance’ 0 Shares 6 ‘Outlander’ season 3: Fergus at beach and Governor’s house 0 Shares 7 ‘Outlander’ season 3 will be ‘bigger’ and ‘bolder’ 0 Shares 8 ‘Prison Break’ Season 5: Sarah Wayne Callies opens up on Michael 0 Shares 9 Features fans want to see again on “The Sims 5” 0 Shares 10 SolarCity CEO quits; Cash-heavy competitors pose threat to Tesla 0 Shares Follow Us Please enter a valid email Like us Follow us Full site feed Gov't reveals cyber attack in Australian businesses is rising Telstra Wifi calling capability enabled for iPhone, Samsung Galaxy users Manufacturers get $100-million fund as automotive producers leave Australia Qantas crowned Australia’s most attractive employer PwC, KPMG, Westpac and Commonwealth Bank among Australia’s top companies to work for Microsoft says WannaCry ransomware must be a wake-up call for governments More Business Economy Markets Companies Real Estate Banking & Finance FDA to require restaurants to post nutritional info for their menu starting May 5 Melania Trump welcomes Queen Rania of Jordan, heads to an all-girls school Pump hydro storage can help build 100 percent renewable energy grid Study shows Western Australians are unhappiest at work; older, female employees are more satisfied Egyptians unite after church bombing; Abdel Fatah el-Sisi declares state of emergency Trump to visit China; Xi approves 100-day trade talks plan More News Australia Asia Pacific Africa The Americas Europe Middle East CM Punk dangled lucrative offer by 5 Star Wrestling Michael Schumacher family threat thwarted, offender sentenced Lakers 'fed up' of D'Angelo Russell's lack of leadership, reveals ESPN insider Roger Federer pulled out of French open due to Rafael Nadal, says Todd Woodbridge Ryan Fitzpatrick seeks new opportunity with Buccaneers Rafael Nadal vs Dominic Thiem live stream: Watch Italian Open online More Sports AFL NRL Rugby Union Cricket Soccer Tennis Motor Sports Basketball NFL Fight Sports More Australia to soon grow medical marijuana locally, believes expert Cyber attack 2017: Aussies urged to update anti-virus software Telstra to refund nbn customers not receiving promised speeds Famed Nintendo titles ‘Legend of Zelda’ and ‘Pokemon’ getting mobile version soon Apple Watch can now detect cardiac arrhythmia with 97 percent accuracy Spyslide webcam cover: Features, price and release details More Life Environment & Science Health & Wellbeing Gaming Technology Travel & Food Fashion & Beauty Art & Design 'Supernatural' 12x23 finale spoilers 'Supernatural' 12x22 spoilers 'Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.' season 4 finale: Ghost Rider rejoins team, tracks down Aida; ‘out of this world’ fan experience teased '13 Reasons Why' season 2: What to expect '12 Monkeys' Season 3 episode 3 'Enemy' and episode 4 'Brothers' spoilers ‘Star Wars: The Last Jedi’ spoilers: Force ghost cameo More Entertainment Movies TV Celebrities Music McLaren 570GT Review: Grand, But No Touring Car IBTimes Newsletters Sign up to get the latest headlines delivered to your inbox every morning.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: 4 Stocks I'll Hold Forever Here are some stocks I plan to keep for as long as I'm an investor. Matthew Frankel (TMFMathGuy) May 19, 2017 at 2:23PM There are some stocks in my portfolio (you can find a full list of all the stocks I own here) that I bought because I think they'll do well during the Trump administration, or over the next few years. On the other hand, there are several stocks I own because I think they'll do well for decades to come. Here are four of my "forever stocks" and why I don't plan on ever selling them. Company Symbol Recent Share Price Apple AAPL $153.26 Realty Income O $55.58 Berkshire Hathaway BRK-B $163.72 Welltower HCN $70.01 Share prices are as of 5/10/2017. My "forever" stocks and why I like each one Image source: Getty Images. 1. Apple This is an easy one to start with -- after all, what's not to like about Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)? For starters, the company has a fiercely loyal customer base, and one of the most valuable brand names in the world that gives it pricing power to operate more profitably than competitors. In addition, Apple has done a great job of growing its service-based revenue sources such as Apple Music, AppleCare, and Apple Pay, which provide a steady, predictable stream of income to complement the boost the company sees when it releases a new product. Oh, and Apple's $256.8 billion cash hoard is a nice bonus, and could allow Apple to pursue some interesting value-adding opportunities if a tax repatriation holiday happens. 2. Realty Income Retail REIT Realty Income (NYSE:O) is one of my forever stocks for two simple reasons. It has delivered fantastic performance over the years, and has done so without putting investors at a high level of risk. Specifically, Realty Income primarily invests in high-quality freestanding retail properties, most of whose tenants are in recession-resistant or competition-resistant business models. To name just a couple of examples of Realty Income's major property types, drug stores sell products people need, no matter what the economy is doing. And fitness centers and movie theaters are immune to online competitors. Furthermore, tenants are on long-term "net" leases, which requires them to pay the variable costs of property ownership, such as property taxes, building insurance, and maintenance. All Realty Income needs to do is find a tenant and enjoy years of steadily growing, predictable income. 3. Berkshire Hathaway I've written before that Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B), the conglomerate led by legendary investor Warren Buffett, is such a well-rounded company that it could potentially stand alone in a stock portfolio. Berkshire Hathaway's primary business is insurance, which it operates through wholly owned subsidiaries such as GEICO. Over the years, however, Berkshire has also built up an impressive portfolio of businesses, many of which are household names. Fruit of the Loom, Pampered Chef, BNSF Railways, and Clayton Homes are some of the more well-known Berkshire brands, just to name a few. In addition, Berkshire invests substantial sums of money in common stocks which are hand-picked by Buffett or his stock pickers. The company has a pretty impressive portfolio that includes substantial stakes in Wells Fargo, Coca-Cola, and American Express, among dozens of others. 4. Welltower Welltower (NYSE:HCN) is a real estate investment trust that focuses on healthcare properties, with a main focus on senior housing. The company is the largest healthcare-focused REIT in the market, with about 1,400 properties in the U.S., U.K., and Canada. The main reason I own Welltower as a "forever stock" is that the market for healthcare properties, and senior housing in particular, should perform quite well over the coming decades. The population in the U.S. and Welltower's other two markets is aging rapidly. In fact, the senior citizen population is expected to roughly double by 2050, and the oldest age groups, such as 85-and-up, are growing even faster. As the largest player in its industry, Welltower has the financial flexibility to pursue opportunities as they present themselves, and the operational efficiency advantages to capitalize on the growing industry more than peers. A final thought When I say that I'll hold these stocks forever, I mean that I plan to do so as long as the companies' current business models remain intact. For example, if Realty Income decided to boost its leverage ratio from less than 30% to more than 60%, I might have to reconsider my investment. The point is, these are some of the largest holdings in my portfolio, and they are stocks I bought with the intention of owning forever. However, it's still important to keep yourself informed about how the company is doing, and what has changed, at least on a semi-regular basis (say, by reading its quarterly earnings releases). And if something changes, you need to reevaluate accordingly. Matthew Frankel owns shares of American Express, Apple, Berkshire Hathaway (B shares), Realty Income, and Welltower.

Playing with the “locked” NFC chip on iPhone :D Recent Apple devices have an NFC chip used for specific features like Apple Pay. Unfortunately, Apple hasn't allowed developers to use the chip to communicate with other NFC equipped devices. In Limneos' proof of concept video we can see the iPhone alert to the presence of an NFC device and then alert again when it's absent. Of course, this requires a jailbroken iPhone. It appears we'll soon see a tweak that can enable greater NFC functionality on compatible devices. On Twitter, Limeos says, "Sure I’ll release, I’ll finish my tests and release it." He also notes, "I guess this is how I’ll be unlocking my car doors from now on." Take a look at the video below and please follow iClarified on Twitter, Facebook, Google+, or RSS for updates.

Reply · Like · Mark as Spam Annan - 11 hours ago Can someone explain the implications on the secure enclave. I thought NFC was a part of that? Reply · Like · Mark as Spam Well... - 9 hours ago Nfc is just like wifi or Bluetooth. It's a communications technology. When you put your credit card info in the apple wallet, it's data gets saved to to enclaves, which is basically just a chip that's encrypted so that other apps can't access the data, the enclave(memory chip separate from the regular memory but encrypted to keep outside attacks from accessing the data) can then release the credit card info to the wallet app once the finger print is read and and nfc communication is detecting a special signal that Apple programmed for retailers to use in their also nfc enabled credit card processing terminals. When the enclave gives out the credit card info, Apple actually generates a one time use credit card that the retailer uses to charge the money and then Apple forwards that charge to your card. And the retailer has to pay extra fees to accept that one time use Apple credit card and that's how Apple is making money off people using Apple Pay. So moral of the story, just use the chip in your credit card(which also creates a one time use special number for the retailer so that they can't recharge your card or if hackers hacked the terminal or the servers, they won't be able to use your credit card) instead of Apple Pay and don't use the magnetic chip cause that can be reused if the hackers got a copy of it.

By Oscar Raymundo Staff Writer, Macworld | May 19, 2017 11:28 AM PT Credit: Apple More like this Future Apple Watch could help treat diabetes with sensors that monitor blood... Why Apple’s next killer app is health Research shows the Apple Watch can detect an early sign of heart disease Video What happens to companies that depend on the iPhone? Tim Cook is not only acting CEO at Apple, but he’s also one of its beta testers. This week, CNBC reported that Cook has been testing a new device that monitors his blood sugar levels. This glucose monitor is a prototype attached to Cook’s Apple Watch that can track how food consumption and exercise affects the CEO’s blood sugar levels. Back in February, Cook told students at the University of Glasgow that he had been continuously wearing a glucose monitor, but did not confirm it whether it was an Apple prototype. [ Further reading: The best DVRs for cord cutters ] It’s mentally anguishing to stick yourself many times a day to check your blood sugar. “It’s mentally anguishing to stick yourself many times a day to check your blood sugar,” Cook said. “There is lots of hope out there that if someone has constant knowledge of what they’re eating, they can instantly know what causes the response... and that they can adjust well before they become diabetic.” Apple has been very interested in developing what it calls the “holy grail” in diabetes: non-invasive, continuous glucose monitoring. Last month, it was reported that Apple has had a team of biomedical engineers working on this very project for five years. If successful, these sensors would be able to monitor blood sugar levels without breaking the skin. According to CNBC, Apple is currently conducting feasibility trials in clinics near Cupertino. And the company has also reportedly been in conversations with consultants to figure out “regulatory pathways.” Why this matters: If Apple is successful in creating this next-gen glucose monitor, it would transform the Apple Watch from a wearable accessory to a revolutionary health device. Even though the Watch can now monitor your heart rate and track your activity, it’s obvious Apple wants to add more significant health applications.  To comment on this article and other Macworld content, visit our Facebook page or our Twitter feed.

May 19, 2017 Share Tweet Subscribe to Complex Video via UPDATE: Apple Music's Head of Artist Curation Carl Chery hit us up to shed some light on this story: "Sabrina Claudio’s a star. She’s the latest in a crop of emerging artists I championed first in hope to help turn them into stars. I can’t reveal too much of our strategy but she’s benefiting from the same playbook that helped Bryson Tiller, 6LACK, Khalid, Daniel Caesar and other artists I pushed heavily at an early stage. If you give us a song as good as "Unravel Me," we know exactly what to do to make sure the Apple Music listeners discover it. "Unravel Me" is just the beginning. I’ve had the luxury of listening to unreleased songs from Sabrina’s upcoming project and I’m already obsessed with them. She’s an amazing writer and her sound is evolving. This next project should be big for her.” There you have it. Get aboard the Sabrina Claudio train while there's still space. See below for original story published on 5/19/17 God bless Apple Music for its nebulous algorithms and whatever motivates the people behind it to place certain songs in specific places. God bless Katy Perry for her entertainingly bizarre album rollout. And God bless the shady tweets killing her new single with Nicki Minaj, which spurred me to go to Apple and take a listen. "Swish Swish" is bereft of the guilty pleasure charms (and Migos) of "Bon Appétit;" I never need to hear it again. But by selecting it on Apple Music's Hot Tracks playlist did inadvertently lead me to discover "Unravel Me," one of the best songs I've heard all year. Prior to today I had no idea who Sabrina Claudio is, what she's about, or if her label strategically placed her song under Katy's to spur this kind of unexpected discovery (a handful of other music writers on my timeline shared my experience). Maybe Apple took it upon themselves because, as the the press blast I received this morning tells me, Sabrina's debut EP from March "shot to No. 3 on the iTunes R&B chart sitting only behind Khalid and The Weeknd." Whoever's behind this playlist selection, hat's off. Give yourself a Coke and a pat on the back. "Unravel Me" is intoxicating. Claudio's mesmerizing vocals unspool across an ethereal beat that crescendos to a shimmering chorus about thirstbuckets who will never figure her out. I've been levitating since midnight. Whenever this song releases its grip on me, I'll get around to checking out the rest of her EP, Confidently Lost. If you're into vibey, lust-soaked FKA twigs-type music I suggest you do the same. Until then, watch the appropriately entrancing video for "Unravel Me" above.

Sarah Tew/CNET Phones by Gordon Gottsegen May 18, 2017 1:23 PM PDT @ggottsegen Samsung Galaxy S8 vs. Apple iPhone 7 Sure, it's Samsung's new kid on the block versus Apple's iPhone 7, but will it show how much ground Apple's next iPhone has to make up? by Brian Tong 5:42 Close Drag Autoplay: ON Autoplay: OFF A recently published survey by Morgan Stanley shows that 92 percent of iPhone users are "somewhat likely" or "extremely likely" to upgrade their phone in the next 12 months plan on getting another iPhone. The research note was distributed on Wednesday and later picked up by CNET. Apple's loyalty rate reached its peak in 2015, when the 6S launched. Josh Miller/CNET A 92 percent retention rate is great news for any company, and it's a notable jump from last year when Apple held a retention rate of 86 percent. The highest retention rate Apple ever had was 93 percent in September 2015. In comparison, the same Morgan Stanley survey found that Samsung had a 77 percent retention rate, while LG had 59 percent and Motorola had 56 percent. This news comes after Apple set a market cap record earlier this month, and became worth over $776 billion, making it the most valuable publicly traded company ever. As a result, Morgan Stanley raised its target stock price for Apple to $177 per share, which shows high confidence from investors. Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty, who was quoted in the report, also said she believes the iPhone 8 will not be delayed, despite speculation from others that it will. She claims that there has been no evidence for a delay in the supply chain. At the same time time, Apple has suffered a slight slowdown in iPhone sales. Apple CEO Tim Cook blames frequent iPhone rumors, which makes potential buyers (particularly in China) delay their iPhone purchases. Currently, the company is reportedly planning a big release for a 10-year anniversary iPhone (rumored to be called the iPhone 8) as well as the expected iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus. With such a high percent of people sticking around to Apple's ecosystem, there may be a large amount of iPhone sales at the end of the year.

According to a source, Cook was spotted at the Apple campus wearing a prototype glucose-tracker on the Apple Watch, pointing to Apple’s continuing efforts to add more advanced health monitoring capabilities to the wearable device. A report last month revealed that Apple has been ramping up its efforts to create a new type of sensor that could non-invasively and continuously monitor blood glucose levels. During his visit to the University of Glasgow in February, Cook obliquely shared that he had been “wearing a continuous glucose monitor for a few weeks” and had only removed it before leaving for Scotland, although he didn’t specifically mention it as an Apple initiative, but explained that it was helping him to understand how his blood sugar levels were responding to the foods he was eating, and spoke generally about Apple’s commitment to health and the struggles faced by people with diabetes.

Click to Skip Ad Closing in... Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Apps & Software These are the best Google Assistant features that Siri can’t match Image Source: Dudley Carr Chris Mills @chrisfmills May 19th, 2017 at 2:27 PM Share Tweet Earlier this week, Google finally put the Google Assistant onto iPhones. For the first time, Apple fanboys can use Google’s AI to perform a bunch of tricks, but much more importantly, it means we can finally have a Google Assistant vs Siri showdown. This isn’t a fair fight on several counts: Google’s been doing AI for much longer and has more data to mine; but Siri’s also the built-in AI, which gives her access to far more of the iPhone’s functions. But despite blatant Apple favoritism for Siri, Google Assistant can still pull a bunch of tricks that Siri can only dream of. Don't Miss: Exclusive: The world’s first look at Apple’s final iPhone 8 design in real life Written conversations The first feature you’re likely to notice is that you can type questions to Google Assistant. If, like me, you’d never be seen dead talking to your phone in public, this is a genuinely game-changing feature. It lets you use all the smarts of Google without needing to say actual words in public and have everyone around you judging your movie choice. Written queries get treated exactly the same as spoken things: you can write in natural speech, so things like “set an alarm for 7” or “what’s the weather like today” keeps working just fine. Contextual answers Another of Google’s neat features is that it remembers what you’re talking about. For example, you can ask “Who directed Batman Begins,” and then immediately follow up with “show me pictures of him,” and it’ll bring up images of Christopher Nolan. It goes a long way towards making the Google Assistant feel like a real person, not some kind of information-fetching bot or an enhanced version of Google. Google will even suggest a lot of these follow-up features to you. Once I’d asked about Christopher Nolan, it provided a bunch of prompts like “Images” and “Movies,” which you can tap to get more info. It feels a lot like the information cards that Google serves up when you do an internet search, but easier to access. Flight status You can ask Google “What’s the status of Delta flight 361 to Atlanta,” and it’ll give you info directly within the app without kicking you out to a web page. Siri’s not even close — as with many things, if you ask it for a flight status, it’ll do a web search and give you the top pages. Even when Google can’t give you precise flight status, it still gives useful info. For example, I tried asking “What’s the status of the Delta flight from Charlotte to Wilmington,” it sent me to a web page for Wilmington airport, with Airline:Delta and Origin:Charlotte already filled in. Bots Google has opened up the Assistant’s natural-language-processing to a bunch of third-party companies. One of the better ones is Genius, the music recognition and recommendation database. Ask the Assistant “I’d like to talk to Genius,” and you get a new conversation specifically with the Genius bot. From there, you can type in a couple of lyrics, and it’ll tell you what song you’re listening to and information about it. In many ways, I actually prefer it to Shazam or other services that listen to a sound clip. Quite often, I’m in a bar where a music recognition service won’t work, but I can make out snippets of lyrics. Typing that straight into the Assistant is a little easier than doing a Google search, and gives better results. Shopping list This is a little unfair, because both Google Assistant and Siri do have a shopping list feature. But Google’s is much faster and slicker to use, and syncs to a dedicated Shopping List that’s tied to your Google account, and you can easily manage from multiple devices. Way more importantly, though, Google Assistant doesn’t just keep the shopping list as another list. When you browse to the list in the Home app (or just ask Google Assistant “shopping list,”) you get the option to shop your list using Google Express. You can view the list, browse item options, and then checkout all without leaving the app, or really feeling like you’re doing anything. Where Siri still wins There’s one big caveat to all this, though: Google Assistant requires you to open up an app before you can use it. Siri can be activated by your voice or by pressing the home button, which takes seconds off the process every time you use it. Sure, Google’s voice recognition is much better, and it syncs with all your Google accounts, but that doesn’t really matter if you don’t use it. While Siri remains the only option for the native voice assistant on the iPhone — and I don’t see Apple changing that any time soon  — the Assistant is still going to be second-best.

This tutorial will teach you to check out the amount of storage space your Apple Watch has, the amount of free space available to you and storage usage on a per-app basis. How to see how much storage is available on Apple Watch You can see the free vs. used breakdown of your Apple Watch storage in the companion app on your paired iPhone or directly on the watch itself. Via paired iPhone 1) Open the Watch app on your paired iPhone. 2) Tap the My Watch tab at the bottom. 3) Navigate to General → About. The amount of available storage space is displayed next to “Available”. Total storage capacity (minus the system partition) is shown next to “Capacity”. Because your Apple Watch requires a dedicated partition for the watchOS operating system, and due to the differences between binary and decimal measurements, the capacity shown there will be less than the amount of flash storage your watch actually is outfitted with. On Apple Watch itself 1) Press the Digital Crown button to get to your Home screen, then tap Settings. You can also press and hold the Digital Crown to invoke Siri, then say out aloud “Open Settings”. 2) Tap General in the Settings app. 3) Tap About. There, you can see the device’s capacity and available storage space, along with the number of songs, photos and apps on this watch, the device’s name (you can rename your Apple Watch quite easily), watchOS version, model/serial number, legal notices and more. My Apple Watch Series 2 has eight gigabytes of storage, of which 5.8 gigabytes are available to me and the rest is reserved for watchOS, system apps, temporary files and other items. As I already have some apps and music on my watch, the amount of free space I’m left with is about 4.7 gigabytes. You’ll definitely come to appreciate how much smaller Apple Watch apps are when compared to their iPhone counterparts. How to check storage used by apps on your Apple Watch For a more detailed breakdown of the used vs. available storage space, including the amount of storage space used by each of your apps and their respective data, do this: 1) Open the Watch app on your paired iPhone. 2) Tap the My Watch tab at the bottom. 3) Tap General. 4) Tap Usage at the bottom of the screen. The amount of available and used space is displayed at the top of the screen. The amount of space used by each installed app on the device is shown further below the Storage header. You may need to wait a few minutes until watchOS gathers information about the apps installed on your paired Apple Watch. Unlike with iOS, you cannot delete apps from this section. To uninstall apps, tap the My Watch tab, tap an app in the list (you may need to scroll down), then slide the button Show App on Apple Watch to the OFF position.

Vevo is updating its app for fourth-gen Apple TVs, fusing a swish new user interface—complete with picture-in-picture animations—with streamlined access to original content—something which Vevo's been quietly doubling down on over the past 18 months. Having bagged exclusive album drop footage with the likes of Ariana Grande and The Weeknd along with original 60-second interviews with artists ranging from Harry Styles to De Staat's Torre Florim, the new Vevo on the block is more than just syndicated YouTube uploads. Signing in to the new Vevo on Apple TV—which lands in the App Store this Friday—takes you to a glossy, image-heavy UI, complete with Netflix-style video icons. When building a playlist, thumbnails for videos suddenly spring to life when you hover over them, as if they're competing for your attention versus whatever else may already be playing in the background. The idea is that the more you use the new Vevo, the better it'll get at serving up recommendations. Eventually, you'll just fire up the service and have a stack of new videos, concerts, and interviews to power through. Yes, personalized recommendations have become a bigger deal for Vevo. "Our focus is now on bringing our audience, people who love music, closer to their favorite content," Product manager Anna Zvagelskaya told PCMag. "What we mean by that is all of your favorite music that we recommend is personalized for you. "The content that we curate, the live shows that we produce, the original programming that takes you behind the scenes with your favorite artists, we'll serve it you so that it's instant, it's not a difficult navigation, you don't have to search hard for it, it's just there." It is very beguiling; even during a demo via not-that-great hotel Wi-Fi, videos didn't struggle to load. We're keen to see how this will work with Watch Party, a new feature Vevo first launched on its desktop player in March. It lets artists chat directly with fans, drop in video premieres, curate video playlists, ask questions, and chat amongst themselves. It's perhaps midway between a Reddit AMA and a YouTube playlist in spirit if not in execution. Zvagelskaya said the idea is not to build a social network, per se (you can sign in with an email address, Facebook, or Twitter), but to build a "music network." So far it's had artists including Tinashe and the Lumineers on host duties. Zvagelskaya said that even if artists leave a Watch Party chat, users tend to stick around and continue the conversation. We didn't get to see this in action ourselves (for some reason, Vevo wasn't able to line up a Top 10 artist for PCMag's personal benefit), but we were curious as to why this is coming to Apple TV next instead of mobile platforms. Why Apple TV? Mobile video is, after all, the future and TV is dead. Right? Vevo's own analytics say that average eyeball time on the old Apple TV app is apparently 80 minutes. While the company couldn't give us a breakdown of figures for things like average viewing times on the mobile apps, we were told that this is a significant indicator audiences are receptive to big-screen binging. Apple's tvOS also afforded Vevo's developers greater freedom to experiment with things like picture-in-picture feeds (which are being marketed as "peek-inside-playlists"); these might make the jump to other platforms later in the year, but probably not all of them and definitely not only Apple TVs; tough luck, third-gen die hards. "We wanted to start with tvOS hardware because the platform allows us to be a bit more experimental than some of the others with things like picture-in-picture video previews, you wouldn't necessarily be able to do all of that across every TV platform. Related Hidden Apple TV Features You Should Know Hidden Apple TV Features You Should Know "What we want to do with this is set a new standard for short-form video on the big screen. We're going to roll it out and make that experience as consistent as possible," Zvagelskaya said. Vevo wouldn't comment on where it's headed next in terms of connected TV platforms; there are apps available for Amazon's Fire TV, Roku, Xbox One, and PS4. In the UK, there are also Vevo apps on Sky Q and Virgin Media set-top boxes. Earlier this year, CEO and former BBC digital chief Erik Huggers, told the FT that the long-term plan is to launch paid subscriptions, so we wouldn't be surprised if consoles and family oriented pay TV suppliers are next in line for an update.

Apps iPhone Apps iPad Apps Mac Apps Apple TV Apps Apple Watch Apps The Best Apps Tutorials Jailbreak Jailbreak Tweaks Jailbreak Guide Unlock Guide Deals Latest Deals Devices iPhone iPad Mac Apple Watch Apple TV More Download Wallpapers iPhone Photography Expert Tips Podcasts iOS 11 concept imagines new productivity features for iPad Christian Zibreg on May 19, 2017 3 Apple is going to preview iOS 11 along with other OS updates at its annual developers conference next month and we fully expect the mobile operating system to include advances that should make the Apple tablet a better laptop replacement than it currently is. In the meantime, Federico Viticci and Sam Beckett of MacStories have put together an incredibly detailed concept of iPad-specific features that could be part of iOS 11, including the Finder, a new Shelf feature, drag-and-drop available system-wide and other perks. With the Shelf feature, you would be able to clip pretty much anything with a simple drag-and-drop gesture. Sitting above apps both in full-screen or Split View mode, it would reveal itself automatically when you’re dragging an item towards the top of the screen. The Shelf would display your previously saved items as thumbnail previews and you’d be able to drop an item on top of another item to create a folder in the Shelf. “The idea behind the Shelf is to make it as effortless as possible to hold something for later without the cognitive load of deciding which app or extension should receive it right away.” The Shelf would be paginated and local to each iPad. You’d be permitted to drop almost anything in it: from text selections and images to phone numbers and even songs. Tapping an item in the Shelf would pull up a custom Quick Look preview with additional information and actions relevant to the selected item. And here’s the concept video. Next up: file management. As you know, Apple currently offers the iCloud Drive app for browsing your iCloud files. MacStories has envisioned a Finder for iOS because the argument that iPad doesn’t need to expose its filesystem to the user “lost its validity when Apple introduced document providers in iOS 8 and the iCloud Drive app in iOS 9.” Unlike Finder for macOS, its iOS counterpart would not expose system information beyond the actual files. You’d be able to browse your files in column and grid views, shared items via iCloud with full permission controls, apply tags, use the Versions feature and even take advantage of Siri integration to search across your files. “All the pieces of the current system—iCloud Drive, the document picker and document providers—should be unified into a single Finder app and system-wide layer available everywhere,” said MacStories. Instead of having files stored within app-specific folders on iCloud Drive, users would be able to create files in a top-level iCloud Drive view. As a bonus, rather than list a bunch of installed document provider extensions in a popup, you’d get a full-blown Finder dialog to open files from any folder or app. MacStories notes: With a new set of APIs and user permissions, iOS 11 could allow apps to more easily open each other’s documents in complex (but intuitive) workflows that aren’t possible today. And, obviously, automation could play a role in this down the road, opening the door to ideas such as folder-monitoring utilities and file automation either via Workflow or Hazel-like apps. Finder for iOS would integrate with other features that MacStories has envisioned, such as the Shelf and system-wide drag-and-drop, but without the complexity of macOS. But wouldn’t drag-and-drop clash with iOS’s standard gestures? In a word, no. As MacStories explains: Because drag-and-drop would be fully multitouch-enabled, it wouldn’t block the iOS interface: another finger could be used to navigate in a different “drop area” of an app, or a user could keep dragging until the Split View app picker is shown and drop an item onto an app’s icon, opening a contextual action menu. App Store could be redesigned around Apple Music-inspired redesign, as show below. Apple could even bring aspects of the watchOS interface to iOS and move beyond the static, inexpressive nature of its interface. “Touch-down states for icons and buttons would add useful context to iOS toolbar icons and menus as well,” reads the article. A better Split View implementation is one of my favorite concepts proposed by MacStories for iOS 11. In addition to supporting drag-and-drop between the apps in Split View mode, you’d gain the ability to quickly select an app for Split View by choosing it from a Home screen like view complete with Spotlight integration for surfacing Split View-enabled apps. Be sure to visit the MacStories concept for additional high-resolution mockups and detailed descriptions of other proposed enhancements, such as improvements to Notes and Control Center, better extension support in Safari and more.

Tim Cook might already have access to a next-level Apple Watch feature. Image: Jose Sanchez/AP/REX/Shutterstock By Brett Williams2017-05-19 14:26:00 UTC Apple CEO Tim Cook will be the first to tell you — he loves the Apple Watch and its health tracking capabilities. So if there's anyone who would serve as a high-profile guinea pig for a breakthrough new feature for the device, Cook's a top candidate. Which is why it may come as no surprise that Cook has been spotted out and around on Apple's campus sporting a specialized version of the Watch, according to a report from CNBC. Connected to Cook's Watch is a new device that is said to be a prototype of a glucose-tracker, which is rumored to be in development for a future version of the wearable. Apple's many mouthpieces will be the first to tell you about how the company is working to revolutionize the world — but this feature has the potential to be truly life-changing. The addition of a non-invasive blood-sugar tracker to the Watch's toolkit could be a real, immediate breakthrough for the millions of people around the world living with diabetes.  SEE ALSO: Apple, please don't kill the iPad mini This is far from the first time we've heard about the potential for a glucose-monitoring Watch feature. Apple reportedly has an entire team of scientists hard at work on the tech's development, which could come in the form of modular Watch bands or some other external add-on to the device.    The glucose monitoring function would do more than just add another health-centric feature to the world's best-selling wearable — it would make it an essential medical device for anyone with diabetes. Today, those people are forced to track their glucose through a variety of more invasive means, like pricking their fingers for blood tests. Cook has admitted that he's worn a glucose monitor before, so this report does carry some extra weight. He told a group of University of Glasgow students about his experience wearing such a device in February, CNBC reports, and reiterated the lengths that people who live with diabetes go through every day in order to monitor their blood sugar using conventional means.    There's no doubt that Apple is focused on bringing health tech to the masses via the Watch — Cook said as much in February. "This is an area where I'm very excited about Apple's contribution," he told the group. "Very excited."

The Australian woman, who asked not to be identified, was traveling from Beijing to Melbourne, Australia when she woke up two hours into the flight to the sound of her headphones exploding and a burning sensation. The woman’s face, hands and hair were burned during the incident. Read: Apple Will Introduce New MacBook Lineup At WWDC, Could Debut Revamped MacBook Air She was looking to get reimbursement for her headphones and ruined clothing, but Apple said the incident was not due to product defects. "Our investigation indicated the issue was caused by a third-party battery," the Cupertino company said in a statement shared by the woman's lawyers. The woman said she bought the batteries in Australia. "The headphones don't work without batteries, yet nowhere on the headphones - or their packaging - did it specify which brand of batteries should be used," she said. The battery and cover of the headphones were melted and stuck on the floor of the airplane. “I continued to feel burning so I grabbed them off and threw them on the floor. They were sparking and had small amounts of fire," the woman said back in February. "As I went to stamp my foot on them the flight attendants were already there with a bucket of water to pour on them. They put them into the bucket at the rear of the plane.” The incident sparked chaos among passengers traveling on the aircraft. The smell of melted plastic, burnt electronics and burnt hair filled the airplane, with people “coughing and choking the entire way home.” Read: Bose Headphones Could Be Spying On Its Users, Wiretap Lawsuit Claims After the incident, the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) reminded travelers of safety precautions when using battery-powered devices. The Bureau recommended: Batteries should be kept in an approved stowage, unless in use Spare batteries must be in your carry-on baggage NOT checked baggage If a passenger’s smartphone or other device has fallen into the seat gap, locate their device before moving powered seat. If a passenger cannot locate their device, they should refrain from moving their seat and immediately contact a cabin crew member. Apple’s blame on third-party batteries comes after Samsung Galaxy Note 7 devices were globally recalled last year after the phones were found to cause battery fires. The Galaxy Note 7 failure cost Samsung $5.3 billion in operating profit. In October 2016, a Galaxy Note 7 replacement burst into flames on a Southwest Airlines flight. After the incident, the devices were banned from all U.S. aircrafts by the U.S. Department of Transportation, with the Federal Aviation Administration and the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration. Regulators said passengers with the Note 7 would be denied boarding a flight, and could face fines and even criminal prosecution if they were found to have violated the ban.

SoundHound is a music identification app that can tell you all about a song, whether it listens to music playing near you or you're humming a tune you just can't get out of your head. It also comes with a built-in virtual assistant called Hound, which can make identifying and playing music in the app even easier. Here's everything you need to know about SoundHound. What's new with SoundHound? In its most recent update, version 7.5, SoundHound added more integration with Apple Music. Though it was one of the first third-party apps to work with Apple's music streaming service back in 2015, SoundHound 7.5 takes it to the next level with support for automatic Apple Music playlist creation based on your SoundHound history. Additionally, you can now play items from Apple Music hands-free in SoundHound using the built-in virtual assistant, Hound. You can also now stream full songs while taking advantage of LiveLyrics, which let you jump to different points in a song by double-tapping a section of the lyrics. What is SoundHound? SoundHound focuses on music discovery and can listen to music around you and identify it. But SoundHound goes a step further than the likes of Shazam with its identification. In addition to recorded music, you can also sing and hum into SoundHound yourself in order to get answers about that unshakable tune in your head. What else does SoundHound do to help me find new music? You can search for artists, songs, and lyrics, scroll down on the app's main screen to see top music videos, and check out top charts, and view your history to see what songs you've searched for or identified. You can also find weekly featured songs, videos, artists, and albums, and, in a unique discovery spin, artists born on that particular day. SoundHound also offers a different take on social music discovery, showing what people near you are listening to at any given time with the Music Map. How does SoundHound work with music services like Apple Music? You can connect SoundHound to your Apple Music account. Subscribers can have the app automatically build a playlist based on their SoundHound history, to be continually updated the more you discover. Spotify and Pandora users can also connect to the app to listen to songs and playlists from those services. You can also allow SoundHound to access your iPhone or iPad's music library and play songs directly from your playlists. If you'd still rather buy your music, SoundHound also lets you purchase songs and albums from iTunes You mentioned LiveLyrics before. What are they? LiveLyrics show up with each song you play in SoundHound, and make listening and following along with lyrics a bit more of an interactive experience. LiveLyrics move in real time as the song plays, highlighting the relevant words. You can expand LiveLyrics to take up the whole screen to make reading them easier (for instance, if you want to sing along). You can also tap around the LiveLyrics to jump to different points in the song without needing to scrub through the playback bar. And what was that about a virtual assistant? Like Siri? Back in 2015, SoundHound launched Hound, a Siri-like, voice-controlled virtual assistant. While initially available as a standalone app, Hound is now also a part of the SoundHound apps. You can use Hound to play a song from Apple Music, access SoundHound's playlists, or perform a search. And of course, you can also use Hound to tell the app to start listening to the music around you. All you need to do to start Hound is say "Ok Hound". The company has put a lot of work into Hound's responsiveness, and the assistant activates right away. Does SoundHound cost anything? SoundHound actually comes in two versions; both are universal apps for the iPhone and iPad. The first is available for free, though an in-app purchase of $6.99 removes the app's ads and offers extra features. The SoundHound Premium app is fully-featured and offers no in-app purchase; Instead, the app is available on the App Store for $6.99. Both apps are kept up-to-date, and version 7.5 launched for both on the same day. Free (SoundHound) - Download Now $6.99 (SoundHound Premium) - Download Now Questions?

Shazam has always struggled identifying songs during live performances, because it doesn't sound like the album versions. So if you're at a concert and want to know what that song is that they are playing, Shazam often returns no results. But SoundHound almost always correctly identifies it. Along with the singing and humming identification features, this puts SoundHound ahead of Shazam for me. 0 13 hours ago Reply Mike Tanasychuk Couldn't agree more! 0 12 hours ago Reply Mobile Nations 500M Consumers Reached Yearly Copyright 2017 Mobile Nations Terms and Conditions Privacy Policy Careers: Writer | Dev Licensing External Links Disclosure Advertising Partner
Skip to main content A world of Macs Championing the Mac Pro By Jason Snell Friday, May 19, 2017 at 10:30 am EDT 5 Comments Former lead editor at Macworld for more than a decade, wrote about Apple and other tech companies for two decades. Now I write at Six Colors and run The Incomparable podcast network, which is all about geeky pop culture, and host the Upgrade and Clockwise tech podcasts. You may never buy Apple's next professional Mac, but it still holds an important place in the lineup. If the mood of the past couple of years of the Mac needed to be summed up in two words, I'd nominate "professional angst." Lack of updates to the late 2013 Mac Pro and the MacBook Pro caused consternation; the eventual new MacBook Pro release walked into a tough room and failed to impress. Pro users were up in arms, to the point where (after two vain attempts to reassure them through oblique Tim Cook statements) Apple took the unprecedented step of inviting five journalists to Cupertino to acknowledge its mistakes and promise better things in the future for pros. But what is a pro Mac, really? It's a Mac that's used by professionals, sure — though, as I learned long ago, most professionals use their Macs for more than just work. The next question, then: What is a pro? I'd argue that it's anyone who uses their Mac as the primary tool by which they make their living. This is a broad category that covers a lot of ground, I'll admit. A bookkeeper who spends most of her time in Excel is, by my definition, a professional user. Different professionals have different needs, of course. For years I said that I could continue to do my job using the PowerBook 160 I bought in grad school, so long as it was still equipped with a copy of Microsoft Word 5.1 or WriteNow 4. After all, the alphabet hasn't changed, and writing is still the job of pushing that cursor from left to right across the screen. But I can't really claim that anymore because my job requires access to the Web, and my old computer couldn't do that job very well at all. (Novelist George R.R. Martin still writes his books in WordStar on a PC running DOS; but he has a second computer next to the first for him to use to run modern software and access the internet. That PC is barely even a computer — it's a fancy typewriter.) What makes a "creative" pro? Most of the professions we associate with the Mac are creative ones, largely because those professions provided most of the Mac's userbase in the 80s and 90s. Designers, artists, musicians, and video editors are commonly Mac users. And don't forget scientists and programmers — you can't write iOS software if you aren't using a Mac, and Xcode is a legendary resource hog. So many of these professions are incredibly specific: In the industry they're generally referred to with the buzzword "verticals," so named because they are narrow (i.e., there are very few users in any given category) but require great depth (in terms of the specific demands they put on their hardware and software). Over the years, "pro" became synonymous with this more expensive, high end of the market — because while every profession is a bit different, most creative professionals wanted to push their computers to the limit and were willing to pay to get the very best tools to do their jobs. Traditionally, that need for the very best manifested with machines that were the fastest you could buy — the niche the Mac Pro is supposed to fill today. But the rise of powerful laptops led to a lot of people weighing mobility over power and moving to the MacBook Pro. For some professions, portability is king; it's why the original MacBook Air could sell for $1799. The truth is, every professional user is the most vertical of niches: a target market of one, with specific needs and desires that need to be fulfilled. Very few of us are lucky enough to have the perfect product emerge from Apple's factories, so we have to pick and choose and find the closest approximation that we can afford. That's the advantage of making professional products not just powerful, but flexible in terms of specs and features. The more flexible the product line, the more fuzzy space there is for professional users to fit inside. Learning from the Mac Pro Where Apple clearly went wrong in the Mac Pro (and arguably with the MacBook Pro) is in creating products that weren't conceived with flexibility in mind. The 2013 Mac Pro was an opinionated product in classic Apple fashion, but the resulting design had so little flexibility and upgradeability that it became a rare misfire. I love how Apple approaches product design with an opinionated streak — "this is our vision of the future, take it or leave it" — and in consumer markets, those opinions frequently pay off. But in professional markets, Apple's approach to product design backfired. Starved for new Macs and more power, Apple's product releases (and lack of same) had cornered its professional users. You never know how a cornered animal will react — but it's generally not good. Apple's professional users had their backs to the wall, and the reactions were understandably ugly. Apple's conversation about professional Macs with members of the press, strange though it was, is a positive sign. Apple's executives also came across as understanding that the products they had been making weren't flexible enough. They didn't provide enough of that fuzzy space for niche markets of thousands or hundreds or dozens of users to fit inside. Does every professional Mac user need a Mac Pro? Absolutely not. But the Mac Pro is important to the Mac market as a whole, and not just as a symbol. It's important as a release valve. If you can't use a Mac mini or MacBook or iMac and MacBook Pro to get your job done, the Mac Pro should exist — at a cost, of course — as the solution to any problem. Its job is to keep the most demanding users on the platform. And that's why the Mac Pro is important to all professional Mac users — even if most of us won't end up buying or using it.

Compare that to how flexible and customizable the Dell's pro line Precision machines are - both the mobile workstations and the fixed - and it isnt even a contest.

U.S. Editions Australia Edition China Edition India Edition Italy Edition Japan Edition Singapore Edition United Kingdom United States May 20, 2:47 AM EDT Subscribe Search Search Business Technology World National Media & Culture Millennial Money Entertainment Sports Subscribe Technology iPhone 8 Rumors: 3D Touch Components For OLED Display 150% More Expensive By Ken Manbert Salcedo On 05/19/17 AT 1:22 PM Close A new report claims that Apple’s 3D Touch components on the OLED-equipped iPhone 8 are 150 percent more expensive than its LCD counterpart. This news arrives amid speculations that Apple’s iPhone 8 might cost $1,000 when it launches this fall. Touch panel maker TPK Holdings quoted that the 3D Touch components for the iPhone 8’s OLED display will cost $18 to $22. TPK also said that that Apple has accepted the quote, according to the Economic Daily News (via DigiTimes). TPK and fellow maker General Interface Solution (GIS) currently charges Apple $7-$9 for the 3D Touch LCD panels on the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. The processing cost of the 3D Touch OLED panels is only 50 percent more than its LCD counterpart, but TPK and GIS are allegedly quoting three times more than that. The OLED display requires a separate protective glass that’s bonded on the front and back of a device, according to MacRumors. This process is done to reinforce the fragile OLED display. This is an important factor in building the new OLED-equipped iPhone since 3D Touch requires users to press down on the display. It’s been previously reported that Apple is planning to embed its Touch ID sensor beneath the iPhone 8’s OLED display. This may also require additional care and processing, as pointed out by 9To5Mac. Earlier this month, JPMorgan analysts estimated that the iPhone 8’s bill of materials (BOM) could cost Apple an additional $75-$80. The huge increase of price for the internal and external components will surely translate to a higher price for the final product itself. The most popular rumor that’s going around is that the iPhone 8 might cost more than $1,000. The most expensive iPhone in Apple’s current lineup is the 256GB iPhone 7 Plus which sells for $969. With that in mind, it’s not hard to imagine Apple slapping a price tag on the iPhone 8 that’s beyond $1,000. After all, the upcoming phone is rumored to become Apple’s “premium” device. Apple’s iPhone 8 is rumored to come with a glass body and a stainless steel frame. The size of the OLED display itself remains a mystery with speculations ranging from 5-inches to 5.8-inches. The iPhone 8 is believed to have an edge-to-edge OLED display that completely removes the top and bottom bezels up front. However, JPMorgan analysts believe that the OLED display on the iPhone 8 will only be edge-to-edge horizontally leaving some room for slim bezels on the top and bottom. If the analysts are right, Apple’s premium device could look similar to Samsung’s Galaxy S8. Since the iPhone 8 might be Apple’s most expensive smartphone yet, the tech giant will still be offering more affordable options. Apple is also rumored to debut the 4.7-inch iPhone 7s and 5.5-inch iPhone 7s Plus. Unlike the iPhone 8, the iPhone 7s and 7s Plus are said to be using LCD display rather than OLED. The two are expected to only have some incremental upgrades from the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. Join the Discussion Most Read The Newsletter Exclusive articles delivered to your inbox daily.

New, 57 comments Siri vs. Assistant by Chaim Gartenberg@cgartenberg May 19, 2017, 1:12pm EDT share tweet Linkedin Some of the biggest news to come out of Google I/O this week was that Google Assistant is coming to iOS, looking to take a shot at Siri, Apple’s own entrenched AI assistant. While Assistant has been available on Android for a while now, how does the AI assistant stack up against Siri when its forced to go head-to-head on Apple’s far more limited playing field? We put the two head-to-head. Access One of the most important parts of any AI assistant is how easy it is to access. One of the biggest selling points of Amazon’s Echo hardware is the always-listening feature that lets Alexa always be on hand to respond to any queries or commands. On Android, Assistant has deep, OS-level hooks that make it more more accessible and functional. But on iOS, things are a little tougher. Siri: On Apple’s hardware, Siri still has a massive home court advantage when it comes to actually starting the digital assistant. Namely, Siri is baked into iOS on a core level — its accessible from anywhere, whether you’re in an app or at your lock-screen by simply holding down the home button. Siri is also always listening, too, and can be activated anytime through a “Hey, Siri” command on newer iPhones (although the feature, like much of Siri these days, feels largely half-baked.) Assistant: Google is making a big play here with Assistant, but it’s fighting an uphill battle here with the inherent limitations Apple has on iOS. That means that Assistant lives in the Assistant app. But Google is doing its best to put Assistant in as many places as possible: there’s an Assistant widget to quick launch the app, which is accessible from both the notification shade, the lock screen, and the home screen. Plus, there’s a 3D Touch action to also start Assistant. Hardware integration Unlike when Siri first launched back in 2011, AI assistants can’t just work with a single device anymore. Working on an iPhone is one thing — but working across an entire ecosystem is a whole other ballgame. Siri: The best thing that can be said about Apple’s assistant is that it exists on a variety of hardware platforms. If you’ve got an Apple Watch, a Mac, or an Apple TV, you can use Siri on it, but that’s about the extent of it. Siri on different platforms largely exist as separate things — you can’t use the native Siri on your iPhone to play a song on your Apple TV, for example, or use Siri on your Apple TV to make a call. Controlling smart home utilities with Siri only works if manufacturers support Apple’s HomeKit, and you’ll need either an Apple TV or iPad to serve as a hub. Plus, you’re still locked strictly to Apple’s ecosystem — if Cupertino doesn’t make hardware for it (like, say, an Amazon Echo-like speaker), then you can’t use Siri on it. Assistant: Obviously, just like Siri works with Apple stuff, Assistant works with Google stuff. That means Chromecast, Android phones, and of course, Google Home. But one of the announcements to Assistant at I/O was that third-party hardware manufacturers would be able to integrate Assistant into their own devices, which means that there could be a much larger ecosystem for Assistant in the near future. Google also showed off how Assistant can work across multiple devices — using a Chromecast to display visual results from a Google Home, suggesting a more universal experience than Siri. How that will work in practice is still somewhat unclear, given that the feature doesn’t seem to be available yet (at least through Assistant on an iPhone.) But it speaks to Google’s larger ambitions of having a unified Assistant platform across all devices. Functionality: Of course, an assistant is only useful if it can actually assist you with things. And at this point, there's basic table stakes that both platforms are able to accomplish — basic queries of the weather and sports scores, calendar reminders, alarms, etc. That said, there are clear differences between the two in terms of the extent of their abilities. Siri: Siri is able to do more advanced queries like tell you the time difference between two cities or what the price of gasoline is in San Fransisco, typically drawing on resources like Wolfram Alpha and Wikipedia to answer, but in practice I’ve generally find it easier and more reliable to just Google the question. And most of Siri's functional advantages — things like opening up apps or sending iMessages — stem from the aforementioned platform advantage than any intrinsic usefulness to Siri itself. Assistant: Even with the limitations of iOS, Assistant gets a lot done. You can play videos in YouTube, add reminders and events through Google Calendar, and send emails through Gmail. Plus, there’s the usual AI assistant queries of stocks, the weather, and maps that’s common to both Siri and Assistant. Google has also tried its best to offer messaging and call support on iOS, but it can only get so far — both will get you 99 percent of the way there before passing you back to Apple’s apps for actually sending the message or placing a call. Meanwhile, things like setting an alarm just aren’t possible with Assistant on iOS, and others — like playing music, which shunts you over to YouTube — work, but are a bit of a hack. Google it can only get so far on iOS But even putting aside those similarities, Assistant has the entire power of Google’s Knowledge Graph behind it, which means that the breadth of information it can answer is wider than Siri’s. Also, Assistant just seems to work better in my experience when it comes to both understanding words and responding quickly. That said, some of the more impressive features of Assistant from Google I/O simply aren’t here yet. The impressive Google Lens augmented reality camera, or even simpler demos like the interactive Panera order seen on stage aren’t part of the app yet. Developer support Amazon has really led the way with developer supporter when it comes to Alexa, with over 10,000 different third-party skills available. Siri and Assistant both have some third-party support, but both companies could stand to take a page from Amazon's book here. Siri: Apple finally added third-party developer support for Siri with iOS 10, but it's still limited — developers can’t make Siri integrations for mapping or music apps, an intentional limitation that forces you to use Apple’s own Music and Maps services, even if you prefer Google and Spotify. Developers for Siri extensions are instead limited to seven categories of integration: ride book, messaging, photo search, payments, VoIP calling, workouts, and climate and radio. So even if you’d wanted to build a Siri extension to play Jeopardy or tell you how many people are in space right now, you can’t. Assistant: Google also took things slowly when it came to building out Google Assistant and Google Home's third-party abilities, but at I/O this year it opened the door for developers to make extensions for Assistant on both Home and phones. Plus, those actions won’t be targeted to specific devices — rather, if your hardware can support the skill (which could, say, require a screen to function), it’ll be able to access it. But it’s up to developers to actually build out the ecosystem. Task completion Answering questions and search is only half the equation, though. AIs also need to be able to actively do things for you, make your life easier. Neither platform is outstanding at this yet, but it’s definitely something to keep an eye on in the future both digital assistants continue to mature. Siri: Siri is a mixed bag when it comes to actually accomplishing tasks for you. In theory, you can look up restaurant reservations or movie times through OpenTable or Fandango, but it will still fall on you to actually complete the task yourself. Other things, like booking an Uber can be done entirely through Siri, as can sending money through Square Cash or Venmo, but that’s pretty much as far as it can go. Assistant: Like Siri, Assistant is also limited when it comes to actually doing things for you, at least for now, and some things that Siri can do — like summon an Uber — aren’t on Assistant for now. But, as mentioned before, Google has high hopes for what can eventually be done with assistant, like sending flowers or ordering lunch, but right now things are still extremely limited on an iPhone. But if Google (and the third party developers it needs to jump on board) can actually ship some of the integrations shown off at I/O this year, Assistant could get a huge leg up on Siri. Directly comparing any third party AI assistant — whether from Google, Microsoft, or another company — to Siri is always going to be a tough proposition, given how locked down iOS is on a system level and Apple’s tight control over the platform. Siri — while still not great — is good enough for now As things stand right now, between Siri’s advantages when it comes to native integration to things like messaging and music, along with the system-wide availability that makes it accessible at any time means that in most cases, it’s easier to use Apple’s assistant. While Assistant does clearly best Siri when it comes to overall knowledge and support for Google services, (including Maps) the current implementation just isn’t so dramatically better at these tasks that it’s worth the extra inconvenience of working around Apple’s sandboxing. That said, Google does have some seriously impressive ambitions for Assistant that could shift the scales in its favor. But those features aren’t here yet, and for what Assistant can do on iOS now, Siri — while not great — is good enough.

However recent rumors have suggested that the refresh could take place in June where it could debut alongside the rumored Siri speaker (Apple’s answer to Amazon’s Echo and the Google Home). Whether or not that will happen remains to be seen, but a report from DigiTimes (via 9to5Mac) has suggested that production of the tablet is currently ramping up where it is expected to be launched and made available in June. Assuming it’s true, the 10.5-inch model will not only represent a new size option, but also another addition to the iPad Pro lineup which features  12.9-inch and 9.7-inch models. According to DigiTimes, “The upstream supply chain’s shipments for Apple’s new 10.5-inch iPad Pro have been increasing recently and the device’s monthly shipment volume is expected to grow to 600,000 units in July, up from around 500,000 units currently, helping its annual shipments to reach five million units in 2017, according to some market watchers. The 10.5-inch iPad Pro began mass production in March-April.” Over the years DigiTimes has had a pretty spotty record when it comes to Apple-related rumors, so maybe you should take this with a grain of salt, but it definitely seems to in line with what we’ve heard so far.

Sections Search Help/Info Subscribe: Digital | Home Delivery Subscribe Help/Info     Breaking News Bar   Entertainment updated: 5/19/2017 10:50 AM Vevo Updates Apple TV App With Slick New Look Facebook Twitter 200 Email Print Comments 0 hello Article to: (required) Article from: (required) Add a message (optional) Success - Article sent! close   Associated Press     Vevo is updating its app for fourth-gen Apple TVs, fusing a swish new user interface-complete with picture-in-picture animations-with streamlined access to original content-something which Vevo's been quietly doubling down on over the past 18 months. Having bagged exclusive album drop footage with the likes of Ariana Grande and The Weeknd along with original 60-second interviews with artists ranging from Harry Styles to De Staat's Torre Florim, the new Vevo on the block is more than just syndicated YouTube uploads. Signing in to the new Vevo on Apple TV-which lands in the App Store this Friday-takes you to a glossy, image-heavy UI, complete with Netflix -style video icons. When building a playlist, thumbnails for videos suddenly spring to life when you hover over them, as if they're competing for your attention versus whatever else may already be playing in the background. The idea is that the more you use the new Vevo, the better it'll get at serving up recommendations. Eventually, you'll just fire up the service and have a stack of new videos, concerts, and interviews to power through. Yes, personalized recommendations have become a bigger deal for Vevo. "Our focus is now on bringing our audience, people who love music, closer to their favorite content," Product manager Anna Zvagelskaya told PCMag. "What we mean by that is all of your favorite music that we recommend is personalized for you. "The content that we curate, the live shows that we produce, the original programming that takes you behind the scenes with your favorite artists, we'll serve it you so that it's instant, it's not a difficult navigation, you don't have to search hard for it, it's just there." It is very beguiling; even during a demo via not-that-great hotel Wi-Fi, videos didn't struggle to load. We're keen to see how this will work with Watch Party, a new feature Vevo first launched on its desktop player in March. It lets artists chat directly with fans, drop in video premieres, curate video playlists, ask questions, and chat amongst themselves. It's perhaps midway between a Reddit AMA and a YouTube playlist in spirit if not in execution. Zvagelskaya said the idea is not to build a social network, per se (you can sign in with an email address, Facebook, or Twitter), but to build a "music network." So far it's had artists including Tinashe and the Lumineers on host duties. Zvagelskaya said that even if artists leave a Watch Party chat, users tend to stick around and continue the conversation. We didn't get to see this in action ourselves (for some reason, Vevo wasn't able to line up a Top 10 artist for PCMag's personal benefit), but we were curious as to why this is coming to Apple TV next instead of mobile platforms. Why Apple TV? Mobile video is, after all, the future and TV is dead. Right? Vevo's own analytics say that average eyeball time on the old Apple TV app is apparently 80 minutes. While the company couldn't give us a breakdown of figures for things like average viewing times on the mobile apps, we were told that this is a significant indicator audiences are receptive to big-screen binging. Apple's tvOS also afforded Vevo's developers greater freedom to experiment with things like picture-in-picture feeds (which are being marketed as "peek-inside-playlists"); these might make the jump to other platforms later in the year, but probably not all of them and definitely not only Apple TVs; tough luck, third-gen die hards. "We wanted to start with tvOS hardware because the platform allows us to be a bit more experimental than some of the others with things like picture-in-picture video previews, you wouldn't necessarily be able to do all of that across every TV platform. "What we want to do with this is set a new standard for short-form video on the big screen. We're going to roll it out and make that experience as consistent as possible," Zvagelskaya said. Vevo wouldn't comment on where it's headed next in terms of connected TV platforms; there are apps available for Amazon's Fire TV, Roku, Xbox One, and PS4. In the UK, there are also Vevo apps on Sky Q and Virgin Media set-top boxes. Earlier this year, CEO and former BBC digital chief Erik Huggers, told the FT that the long-term plan is to launch paid subscriptions, so we wouldn't be surprised if consoles and family oriented pay TV suppliers are next in line for an update.

By Fora Staff Friday 19 May 2017, 5:19 PM 14 hours ago 23,574 Views 79 Comments http://jrnl.ie/3399393 Share933 Tweet Email Image: Youtube Image: Youtube MARGRETHE VESTAGER, THE EU’s Competition Commissioner, has said that Ireland is taking too long to recover the €13 billion in back-taxes owed by Apple. The EU Commission ruled last year that the multinational tech giant owes Ireland the sum for profits that went untaxed for more than a decade. Both Apple and Ireland strongly reject the commission’s decision, and plan to challenge it through the EU’s courts. It is expected to take years before a final outcome is reached. However, in the interim, Ireland is obliged to collect the funds. This money will then be held in a third-party holding account pending the outcome of the appeal against the decision. If the appeal is successful, the money will be paid back to Apple. The original deadline for Ireland to collect the money was in early January. Speaking to CNBC, Vestager said that Irish authorities are “taking too long” to get unpaid taxes from Apple. She said that she hoped that officials would recover the money from the company ”very soon”. Margrethe Vestager Source: Sam Boal Vestager also dismissed comments from Apple CEO Tim Cook, who suggested that the EU’s ruling could discourage the company from investing more in Europe in the future. “I haven’t seen any evidence of that,” she said. Deadline A statement from the EU Commission also said that it expects Ireland to make “material progress” soon to recover the money from Apple. “If member states fail to meet their obligation, the commission may decide to refer them to the EU courts for failure to implement a state aid decision, in line with the EU Treaty,” it said. In a statement, the Department of Finance said that it is in the process of recovering the money from the company. “Despite (our) appeal, Ireland is required to comply with the binding articles of the commission’s final decision and ensure that the alleged aid is recovered from Apple,” it said. “This involves the calculation of the exact amount of the aid and the process by which Apple are deprived of the sums, which the commission estimated to be €13 billion plus EU interest.” Source: Sam Boal It added: “Although the formal deadline has now passed, it is not unusual or uncommon for (EU) member states to require more time for recovery. “Irish officials are continuing this intensive work to ensure that the state complies with all our recovery obligations as soon as possible, and remain in regular contact with the commission and Apple.” ‘Tricky’ Towards the end of January, when the initial deadline for collection had passed, Vestager conceded that the recovery process is a difficult for Irish authorities because of the huge sums of money involved. “It’s a tricky thing to do because it’s a large sum so of course you have to figure out how to do that,” she said in January. “It’s not as an escrow account in some of the other cases where it might be €25 or €30 million … and therefore I do respect that it’s a complicated matter and it may take a little more time.” Sign up to our newsletter to receive a regular digest of Fora’s top articles delivered to your inbox.

Apple has been highlighting the importance of accessibility features throughout the week, beginning with a large collection of "Designed for" promotional videos that it posted on YouTube on Tuesday. The clips showcased features like VoiceOver and Made for iPhone hearing aids, accompanied by personal stories of how Apple fans with disabilities use each feature.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile This is the iPhone of our dreams and it probably won’t ever exist Image Source: Gabor Balogh Zach Epstein @zacharye May 19th, 2017 at 11:44 AM Share Tweet Apple’s upcoming new iPhone 8 will feature a bold new design, and not a moment too soon. After three consecutive iPhone generations that each feature nearly identical hardware designs, consumers are beginning to get antsy. iPhone sales are slumping, and Apple fans are due for something fresh and new. Come September, it looks like they’ll get exactly what they want — a fresh new iPhone 8 that features an OLED screen, a class-leading screen-to-body ratio, 3D scanning features, augmented reality features, and plenty more. People are clearly excited for the iPhone 8, and rightfully so. As impressive as Apple’s next iPhone is expected to be, however, it pales in comparison to the futuristic iPhone featured in the video below. Don't Miss: Apple’s iPhone 8 will basically bring back the headphone jack Earlier this week, we gave the world its first look at what our source believes to be Apple’s finalized iPhone 8 design. It’s a bit thicker than the company’s current iPhones, but it packs a 5.8-inch OLED display into a phone with about the same footprint as the current 4.7-inch iPhone. It also sports polished stainless steel around the edges to create a look and feel that is continuous. Of course, it’s nothing like the concept dreamt up by graphic designer Thiago Duarte. YouTube channel ConceptsiPhone posted a new video last night that shows a vision of Apple’s iPhone in the year 2020. Before we actually dive into it, you should know that there is a 0% chance this is what Apple’s iPhones will look like in 2020. Maybe less than 0%. That said, it’s still fun to imagine what it would be like to use an iPhone like this, and the possibilities are endless. Apple’s lead designer Jony Ive has said that his dream is an iPhone that is a single sheet of glass. Some day, he may realize that dream (probably not), but today we get a taste of what it might be like to use an iPhone with a design that features one continuous piece of glass from the front of the phone to the back. In fact, it’s not just the glass that wraps around the entire phone — the display does as well. Here are the proposed features posted by ConceptsiPhone alongside the video: 360° for more possibilities – this feature represents what we believe as the future of smartphone. No ports, thanks to the wireless charging and data transfer. Oh, except one, the SIM tray. Main body surrounded by the screen and it’s even better protection against water and dust. Speakers on both sides. FaceTime and Dual Camera on both sides. iOS 14 Fingerprint sensors on all around the device! Like we said, it looks awesome and all those features sound nice, but a phone like this will not exist in 2020. In fact, it might not ever exist.

Cities should proceed with caution. The ride sharing service’s new deal with Innisfil, Ont. points to its future-proofing strategy, but municipalities need to think hard before partnering up Colin Horgan May 19, 2017 Twitter Facebook Google+ Share LinkedIn Reddit Email   (Maskot/Getty) Uber is enjoying a string of good news stories in Ontario. Back in March, the company was announced as one of the “platinum” backers of the new Vector artificial intelligence institute launching in Toronto, which is part of a larger plan to make the province a global hub for A.I. research and development. On May 8, Uber announced it plans to open a self-driving car research group in Toronto, headed by University of Toronto assistant professor Raquel Urtasun. The work she’s been doing “focuses on developing the software that allows self-driving cars to ‘see’: recognizing objects so they can navigate the world smoothly and safely,” Uber CEO Travis Kalanick wrote. And then on Monday the small town of Innisfil, Ont. became the first in Canada to subsidize Uber rides as part of a plan to provide transportation services along specific routes to people who might otherwise outside the reach of public transit. Along those routes, residents will pay a base fair – $3 to $5 – and the city covers the rest, if necessary. The city also offers to cover $5 of non-routed trips residents might want to take within the city’s boundaries. Innisfil concluded that expanding bus service to some areas might cost as much as $1 million; subsidizing Uber, on the other hand, might cost as little as $175,000 over the course of the six-month pilot project. MORE: Ontario town launches Uber public transit service Of course, the first two news items are directly related to the third: Some day, the ride-share cars that make up for gaps in public transit won’t be driven by locals – either those looking to make some extra cash, or those for whom it’s a full-time job. Instead, those connecting routes might be staffed by autonomous vehicles. But why does Uber, a disruptive tech company, want to attach itself to something as archaic as public transit? Uber knows that when it comes to driverless vehicles, it will have a lot of competition. This February, Waymo, Alphabet’s autonomous car unit, filed a lawsuit alleging that one of its former employees stole trade secrets and took them to Uber. (Some of its claims were later dropped.) In the (near) future, both the frequency of these kinds of patent dust-ups and the accusations involved are likely to intensify. But the thing to remember is that Uber is not a company that makes things. Unlike Alphabet (Google’s parent company) or Tesla or Ford or General Motors or even Apple, Uber’s product is just an app. While Uber is currently testing driverless cars, what it’s really testing is the driving software. This is cutting edge stuff at the moment, but it could still leave Uber in a precarious position. “If these tech and car outlets all create cars that can drive by themselves, what role does Uber or Lyft [Uber’s main competitor in the rideshare universe] play in that transaction?” Nick Bilton asked in Vanity Fair last year. That is to say, were it to remain just a platform to connect people with drivers, Uber would lose market share, eventually, to companies like Google or Apple, who could conceivably make that experience much easier given their combined mobile platform dominance. You might not need a separate rideshare app—your phone, knowing your schedule, could arrange for an Apple or Waymo car to come pick you up automatically. RELATED: Why Uber’s manipulation of drivers is so wrong That would leave Uber hoping that it remains popular, or that other companies integrate it with their car networks rather than build their own consumer-facing products. Still, even if Uber “could offer to connect cars to passengers… in doing so, they will likely want a cut of the revenues that the carmaker gets from each transaction. It doesn’t take an insider at Apple to know that Tim Cook probably wouldn’t want to give Uber 20 per cent of Cupertino’s car profits,” Bilton wrote. Is this why Uber is latching on now to public transit? Early adoption could, conceivably, make it indispensable to governments all over the world. It may be that, when autonomous vehicles are finally the norm and the competition over riders heats up, Uber wants to have arrangements like the one in Innisfil already in place. In that scenario, Uber will survive despite not making cars—all it has to do is make the software for cars that cities want to buy. Partnerships like the one Uber has with Innisfil also potentially create a new customer base: people who would normally not take an Uber due to its price, but now, thanks to the partnership, can afford it. Eventually, if Uber’s partnerships with city transit continue and expand, it will create a second tier of “public” transportation: one that sticks to designated routes, but is a step up from the bus or subway and a step below a more traditional Uber ride. This scenario creates all kinds of issues that cities like Innisfil, or Toronto, or anywhere else, must consider before entering into these agreements. For example, will the private companies they’re partnering with address the range of accessibility issues that public transit is obligated to? In an indication that Uber is ill-equipped to accommodate those who need mobility aids in cars, Innisfil offers a similar subsidy for people who use the local, regular taxi service. More pressing, however, is what would become of the lowest tier: traditional public transit. Who will pay for it? More specifically, who will want to pay for it? Currently, many citizens are willing to have their taxes go to buses and subways because even if they’re relatively financially comfortable, they still use those services – to get to work or to concerts or sporting events. RELATED: Enough with the Uber bashing already But if there were a more comfortable, private, perhaps cleaner alternative that not only filled in transit gaps but offered better routes, all for a bit more money, would people still feel the same? Would the argument for a truly public transit system still hold? Fewer riders for the old-style public transit system would mean lower revenues, leading to degrading infrastructure. Rather than pay for the upkeep on buses and trains as well as for salaries for their many employees, cities might look to cut their losses and either expand the cheaper subsidy option, leaving publicly-funded transit covering only a fraction of the grid it once did, or get out of the transit game entirely, leaving it to private companies to handle. As services are cut, the poorest tier of transit users would either have to use a decaying, even more underfunded system, or may not have a transit option at all. Most worryingly, cities might not have the chance to ponder the question of where this all leads—once the partnership begins, the market may decide things for them. It’s not hard to see the collapse of public transit as a nightmare scenario. But classes of public transit? Uber currently operates a carpool service. In 2015, Uber tested UberHop, a $5 fixed-route service in downtown Toronto. Stratification of public transit is not some faraway dystopian future—it’s already happening.

They'll probably have new Intel processors that are faster, and longer battery life. Our advice is to hold off on buying a new model, if you can. Todd Haselton | @robotodd 14 Hours AgoCNBC.com SHARES show chapters Apple plans to introduce refreshed MacBooks next month    12 Hours Ago | 00:41 Don't buy a new MacBook right now, no matter what model you're considering. A report this week suggested that Apple is gearing up to announce new MacBooks as soon as next month during its annual developer conference, known as WWDC. It makes perfect sense, too, since this is where Apple typically unveils new software that powers its computers. In this case, we're expecting an update to macOS. Bloomberg said this week that Apple is planning to introduce, at the very least, a refreshed MacBook Pro with Intel's latest seventh-generation processors. Apple, for whatever reason, wasn't able to get those chips in time for the initial launch of the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, which only launched back in October. Apple is also planning to update its smaller and thinner MacBook laptops with the new processors, too, so you'll want to make sure you aren't buying that right now either. Additionally, Apple may — though Bloomberg was less confident on this — finally refresh the MacBook Air laptop, its thin-and-light machine that still offers some of the more traditional ports, like full-size USB and an SD card slot, which people still want. Intel's new processors are more powerful and are also more efficient, which means you should see longer battery life out of them. It's unclear if Apple plans to make any other changes to its laptops, but you'd be silly not to sit on the bench for a few weeks just to find out what's in store. Take this as a simple public service announcement. Sit tight on buying a new MacBook, MacBook Air or MacBook Pro right now. Apple should have fresh models on the market very soon. Oh, and for what it's worth, you also shouldn't buy a new iPad Pro yet.

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Business Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Business Sat, May 20, 2017 - Page 12　 Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp Investors cheer best Asian stock market APPRECIATION:The NT dollar is one of the world’s top-performing currencies, but its growing strength threatens to erode the export-driven economy’s competitiveness Bloomberg One year into President Tsai Ing-wen’s (蔡英文) rule, investors are tallying up their winnings. The nation’s benchmark stock index has surged 33 percent in US dollar terms since Tsai’s inauguration, the best performance among Asian peers. Foreign funds in particular have been fans: They have pumped a net US$16.5 billion into Taiwanese equities in the past 12 months, the most in the region — helping send the New Taiwan dollar to highs last seen in 2014. The gains overcame concern that relations with China, which had warmed under Tsai’s predecessor, would deteriorate under a Democratic Progressive Party government perceived as less friendly to Beijing. Instead, optimism about iPhone sales and a surge in global technology shares supercharged Taiwan’s US$1.1 trillion stock market, which is dominated by Apple Inc suppliers. While challenges to the rally are mounting — with the inflated NT dollar starting to crimp exporter profit growth — a strengthening economy and inexpensive valuations are seen supporting further gains. “One year ago, there were worries about the impact on cross-strait relations and consequently on the economy if the DPP came to power,” KGI Securities Investment Advisory Co (凱基投顧) chairman Tu Jin-lung (杜金龍) said by telephone. “But President Tsai gets at least a ‘B+’ in her first year in office if you take the stock market gains and currency strength as a showcase for the economy.” While Tsai has avoided making any concrete commitments to Beijing’s ‘one China’ principle that governed relations between the two rivals during the administration of former president Ma Ying-jeou (馬英九), that does not appear to have hurt trade that is vital to Taiwan’s economy. Government figures show little change to the roughly 40 percent of the nation’s exports that have gone to China since 2007. Investors are also focused on whether Apple’s next iPhone can meet such high expectations, with the benchmark TAIEX having reclaimed the 10,000 mark for the first time since the dotcom bubble in 2000. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (台積電), Apple’s main chipmaker, has surged 37 percent in the past 12 months to take its market value to more than US$170 billion. Hon Hai Precision Industry Co (鴻海精密), which assembles the iPhone, has jumped 51 percent. The two stocks together account for almost one-quarter of the TAIEX’s total weighting, meaning any disappointment in terms of sales could quickly take the market lower. A surging NT dollar also risks eroding Taiwan’s competitiveness, with exports accounting for more than half of the nation’s GDP. The NT dollar has gained 8.4 percent against the US dollar since Tsai’s inauguration, making it one of the world’s top-performing currencies. Yet, market watchers remain upbeat. Fuh Hwa Securities Investment Trust Co (復華投信), Taishin Securities Investment Trust Co (台新投信) and President Capital Management Corp (統一投顧) all project that the stock index might climb to 10,800 or higher this year, supported by valuations and dividend yields. Even after the rally, the TAIEX trades at 15 times reported earnings, a 10 percent discount to its five-year average, while its dividend yield of 3.7 percent is among the highest in Asia. “In the past, the market started to fall after reaching 10,000, but it’s different this time,” Fuh Hwa Securities vice president Stevie Chou (周奇賢) said. “The electronics sector’s peak season is in the third quarter. Seasonally, cyclically, earnings-wise, valuation-wise, the market is still at fair levels.” 1 2 NEXT › This story has been viewed 718 times. Comments will be moderated.

The corporate event for company employees was organized in recognition of Global Accessibility Awareness Day, a global initiative focused on digital access and inclusion of people with different disabilities. Apple CEO Tim Cook tweeted out an image of himself and Wonder hugging onstage as a thank you to the artist. “Thank you to the incomparable Stevie Wonder for lifting hearts and celebrating accessibility with us,” reads the tweet. Prior “Beer Bash” celebrations at Apple’s headquarters included performances by Maroon 5, One Republic, Darius Rucker and other music artists. Signed, Sealed, Delivered pic.twitter.com/CI38dIU8Vj — James Craig (@cookiecrook) May 19, 2017 “There’s nothing on iPhone or iPad that you can do that I can’t do,“ Wonder, an Apple fan, said in 2011 commenting on the assistive technologies built into iOS and macOS. The artist sang in Apple’s “Someday at Christmas” 2015 holiday commercial. Wonder is blind so having him perform on Global Accessibility Awareness Day is fitting. Apple celebrated Global Accessibility Awareness Day with a series of inspiring videos highlighting assistive technologies built into its platforms, the accessibility-focused “Today at Apple” sessions at Apple Stores, an App Store section highlighting some of the best apps for people with disabilities and three Tim Cook interviews with accessibility activists.

Apps iPhone Apps iPad Apps Mac Apps Apple TV Apps Apple Watch Apps The Best Apps Tutorials Jailbreak Jailbreak Tweaks Jailbreak Guide Unlock Guide Deals Latest Deals Devices iPhone iPad Mac Apple Watch Apple TV More Download Wallpapers iPhone Photography Expert Tips Podcasts iPhone hacked by jailbreak developer to interact with NFC devices Anthony Bouchard on May 19, 2017 8 iPhones have come equipped with Near Field Communication (NFC) technology since the iPhone 6 launched in 2014. NFC’s primary use in the iPhone is for Apple Pay and allows contactless payments via supported merchants at the point of sale. On the other hand, well-known jailbreak developer Elias Limneos was tinkering with iPhone NFC on his spare time and managed to hack it to work in ways that are typically locked off by Apple out of the box. Limneos is well-known for his successful jailbreak tweak releases like AnsweringMachine and CallBar among others, but he’s about to get a whole lot more popular as his work with iPhone NFC continues. He published the following proof-of-concept video on YouTube that demonstrates interaction between an NFC-enabled tag and his modified iPhone 6s: Subscribe to iDB on YouTube As the tag gets closer to the device, the iPhone displays a banner notification acknowledging the tag is in range; conversely, it shows a banner notification acknowledging the tag is out of range as it’s pulled away. While juvenile in its current form, this proof-of-concept is the beginning of a new era into exploring Apple’s closed NFC system. It purportedly works on all NFC-enabled iPhones, including the latest iPhone 7/7 Plus handsets. For what it’s worth, a number of competing Android handsets already allow open utilization of NFC communication out of the box. This hack has the potential to influence similar functions on Apple-branded handsets. Limneos tells us he has plans to eventually release some sort of jailbreak tweak in the future that will unlock NFC access for users, allowing them to do things like unlock NFC-enabled doors and transfer files between devices of various operating systems, among other things. Since the development and understanding of these features are in their early stages, this will come in the distant future, however. Because Apple likes to keep things closed for reasons like efficiency and security, the chances that Apple will ever enable open access to NFC communication in their handsets is low. That said, it’s always fascinating to see talented iOS developers taking things to entirely new levels; with or without Apple’s cooperation.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Qualcomm Gets Double Teamed by Intel and Samsung The chipmaker’s FTC headaches get worse as Intel and Samsung team up with the opposition. Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) May 19, 2017 at 11:00AM At the beginning of the year, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission sued Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), alleging that the mobile chipmaker leveraged its portfolio of crucial wireless patents to force its rivals out of the market. The FTC claims that Qualcomm charged its baseband modem rivals inflated license fees for its wireless patents, which made their chips more expensive than Qualcomm ones. That headache recently got worse, with Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) joining the FTC's side. Intel claims that Qualcomm refuses to sell chipsets to OEMs unless they pay licensing revenues on every chip it sells -- even ones which don't use Qualcomm processors. Intel also argues that Qualcomm refuses to license Standard Essential Patents (SEPs) to its competitors, and that it uses exclusive deals -- like its controversial one with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) -- to monopolize the mobile chip market. Image source: Qualcomm. Samsung, echoing a previous ruling by the Korean FTC, claims that Qualcomm blocked it from selling its in-house Exynos chips to third-party smartphone makers with a patent deal from 1993. If Samsung sold Exynos chips to other OEMs, either Samsung or the OEM would need to pay Qualcomm additional licensing fees -- thus making its chips pricier than comparable Qualcomm chips. These claims paint a grim picture of Qualcomm as a company that leverages its massive portfolio of 3G/4G wireless patents to marginalize rival chipmakers and pressure smartphone makers into lopsided deals. Qualcomm asserts that the claims are "baseless," but the legal battles seem to be escalating rapidly. Previously on Qualcomm vs. the world... Prior to the FTC lawsuit, Qualcomm was fined $975 million in China and forced to lower its licensing fees in 2015, then fined another 1 trillion won ($888 million) in South Korea the following year. Chinese regulators fined Qualcomm for charging licensing fees based on the entire value of a phone, since its licensed technologies were only used in some wireless components. Qualcomm agreed to charge fees based on 65% of the price instead, and renegotiated new licensing agreements with Chinese OEMs. Image source: Getty Images. The Korean FTC alleges that Qualcomm refused to offer fair licenses to rival chipset makers (like Samsung), while charging smartphone makers unfair licensing fees. Qualcomm also faces ongoing probes in Taiwan and the European Union -- which could result in similar fines. Those cases preceded a showdown with Apple, which sued Qualcomm in the U.S. and China. Apple, which exclusively used Qualcomm modems from 2011 to 2016, claims that the chipmaker withheld rebate payments from the deal in retaliation for its cooperation with the Korean FTC during its investigation. Apple also recently started withholding all of its licensing payments to Qualcomm, which resulted in Qualcomm suing four of Apple's contract manufacturers. An ongoing siege on its most profitable business Qualcomm's licensing business will remain under siege for the foreseeable future, which is deeply troubling because it generates the lion's share of the company's profits. If Qualcomm is forced to lower its licensing fees and split its chipmaking and licensing businesses, it could be easier for rivals like MediaTek, Intel, and Qualcomm to gain market share in application processors or baseband modems. However, Qualcomm's wireless patents -- all of which it either developed or acquired -- still give it plenty of legal firepower against these challengers. Intel and Samsung's official backing of the FTC is certainly an unwelcome development, but their motivations are fairly obvious. Image source: Samsung. Intel, which was once fined for paying PC makers rebates to not use AMD chips, likely wants to kneecap Qualcomm to become a preferred alternative supplier of baseband modems -- especially for their shared customer Apple. Samsung, which is being investigated for its influence over the Korean FTC, could bolster its growing semiconductor business if it sells its Exynos chips to other OEMs. Should investors hunker down or retreat? Qualcomm's core business was rock solid when its high-margin licensing business supported its lower-margin chipmaking one. But now its licensing fees are being challenged by OEMs and regulators, and its chips are ceding market share in the highly commoditized mobile market. It's tempting to retreat under these conditions, but investors should also remember that Qualcomm's P/E of 19 is well below the industry average of 26, it pays a hefty forward dividend yield of 4.1%, and its upcoming acquisition of NXP Semiconductors should diversify its business away from mobile devices while strengthening its patent portfolio. Therefore, I don't think that it's the right time to give up on Qualcomm -- even though the next few quarters could be pretty rough.   Leo Sun owns shares of Qualcomm.

Apple lets users restore an iPhone from iCloud when setting up a new iPhone. You cannot choose to do this unless you first reset an iPhone or restore an iPhone. You can choose from multiple backups and multiple devices so it is easy to go back to the last working version of your iPhone or if you want to restore from an old iPhone to a new iPhone with iCloud. You don’t need a computer with iTunes to do this, and unlike an iTunes backup, this will keep your apps and folders in the right place. This does take some time because the apps will re-download from the iTunes app store and the phone needs to download your iCloud data to the iPhone. Learn how to restore iPhone from iCloud. Before you choose to restore an iPhone from iCloud it is a good idea to make sure you are connected to WiFi and to power. You don’t need to connect to Power, but you may need to be connected to WiFi to download some large apps. This process will drain your battery faster than just using your iPhone. When you restore the iPhone from iCloud it also re-downloads your accounts so you should not need to log into anything other than your iTunes account. In our tests, it downloaded Gmail and other apps including a two-factor authentication app and kept our accounts connected and ready to use. It can easily take over an hour for an iCloud restore to complete, but you can start using the phone after 15 to 20 minutes. During the remaining time, you may need to wait for apps to finish downloading. Here’s how to fix a common problem where your iCloud Restore is stuck. How to Restore iPhone from iCloud Here are step-by-step directions to restore an iPhone from iCloud. Get started restoring an iPhone from iCloud. When the iPhone screen shows hello in multiple languages swipe to start the setup. You will then want to Connect to WiFi if available. On the next screen choose to Enable Location Services if you want apps to use your location for helpful tasks. When prompted choose Restore from iCloud backup. On this next screen, you will choose to Restore from iCloud Backup. You will now need to enter your Apple ID & password and then choose Agree. Wait a minute or so for the Apple ID to set up. Choose the iCloud backup to restore to your iPhone. Now you can choose your backup. If you are restoring the iPhone from an iCloud backup you made on this device find it and tap. If you are restoring an old iPhone to a new iPhone tap on that backup. Wait for Apple to verify the restore. Swipe on the second hello screen and then tap on Continue. Enter your Apple ID password again and then choose to set up iMessage & FaceTime. The next screen will ask you to set up Touch ID, create a Passcode and set up Apple Pay. You can skip these if you want. Another screen will ask you about iCloud Keychain. If you use this, you can set up by verifying with another device, which is the easiest method. After this screen you can use the iPhone, but you will need to wait for apps to restore. After several minutes the iPhone will boot to the home screen but you will see apps that are waiting to be completely installed. The grayed out app icons indicate apps that need to be downloaded before you can use them. If prompted enter your Apple ID password in an iMessage pop up. Wait for the iPhone to restore the iPhone from iCloud backup. From here you need to wait for the restore to download apps and put them back in the same place. You cannot use an app until it is downloaded. If several apps are stuck on gray after an iCloud restore you need to open the App Store, tap on Updates and then Update All. This will take a little time to complete. You may see a message that some items could not be restored. The iPhone does not list what those items are, but you can sync to your computer and it may restore some of these items to your iPhone. 28 Best iPhone 7 Cases Speck Presido iPhone 7 Cases   1 / 28 Speck chose to deliver a new line of iPhone 7 cases that look and feel amazing.

I haven’t found an official way to do this, have you tried https://www.myicloudbackup.com ? Thank you! 09/18/2015 kirakazantsev Reply Good idea. 07/10/2016 felish Reply Hi, I am having major issues, got a new replacement 6splus and trying to get it going with icloud backup, it has been days and it just keeps saying restore from icloud. What do i do 08/22/2016 Elijah Clinton (@elijahclin) Reply Nice tips! A reset in the iPhone means that you have lost your data. The device becomes fresh, as if you just brought it from the store. The reason is good enough for people to take a back step when they would like to restore from iCloud backup. Usually, people would like to retrieve data from iCloud due to any of the reasons such as: to restore deleted or lost iOS contents after losing them from the device, to transfer files or contents from an old device to a new device or to recover files from the backup created before restoring the device. And the FonePaw iPhone Data Recovery is the one what you need. You can see the tutorial on their website. Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

Tim Cook's New Accessory: An Apple Glucose Monitor? By Angela Moscaritolo May 19, 2017 10:32am EST 10 Comments CNBC on Thursday reported that Apple CEO Tim Cook was spotted at the company's campus wearing 'a prototype glucose tracker on the Apple Watch.' Evidence that Apple is working on a product for people with diabetes is mounting. CNBC on Thursday reported that Apple CEO Tim Cook was spotted at the company's campus wearing "a prototype glucose tracker on the Apple Watch." The news outlet reckons the device — should it actually come to market — would be a "'must have' for millions of people with diabetes." The rumor comes after CNBC last month reported that Apple had hired a "small team of biomedical engineers" who are working out of an office in Palo Alto, Calif. to develop a "holy grail for treating diabetes." The "super secret initiative" — planned by the company's late co-founder Steve Jobs — aims to "develop sensors that can noninvasively and continuously monitor blood sugar levels to better treat diabetes," according to the report. Though the Cupertino tech giant is generally ultra tight-lipped about new products in its pipeline, Cook may have hinted about a possible Apple diabetes product in February. Speaking with students at the University of Glasgow in Scotland, where he received an honorary degree, Cook said he'd been wearing a glucose monitor for "a few weeks." He didn't say whether it was an Apple prototype or a device from a different company, however. Related Kids' Screen Time Linked to Diabetes Kids' Screen Time Linked to Diabetes "It's mentally anguishing to stick yourself many times a day to check your blood sugar," he said, according to CNBC. "There is lots of hope out there that if someone has constant knowledge of what they're eating, they can instantly know what causes the response... and that they can adjust well before they become diabetic." PCMag's Tim Bajarin, who has diabetes, argued in a recent column that if Apple tackles this area, a real breakthrough would be an affordable, non-invasive, and accurate solution. He uses Dexcom's Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) and says "it has changed the management of my diabetes for the better." But it requires a sensor on his stomach and two small, hair-like wires that get blood sugar readings from an interstitial fluid just below the skin every five minutes. Monitoring via light pulses or sensors on a wrist band or watch, like Apple Watch, would be less invasive, but accuracy is still an issue.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    Apple CEO Tim Cook reportedly has been testing a glucose monitor connected to his Apple Watch to understand how his blood sugar responds to factors like food and exercise. CNBC has reported last month that Apple has a team dedicated to the "holy grail" in diabetes: Non-invasive and continuous glucose monitoring. Cook also talked about the device to a roomful of students in February at the University of Glasgow, where he received an honorary degree. He didn't say if it was a medical device from a company like Medtronic or Dexcom, or an Apple prototype. "I've been wearing a continuous glucose monitor for a few weeks," he said. "I just took it off before coming on this trip." Cook explained that he was able to understand how his blood sugar responded to foods he was eating. He made modifications to keep his blood sugar more constant. Cook recently told CNBC's Jim Cramer that he has lost 30 pounds. It isn't yet clear if the device will be embedded into a future version of the Apple Watch, or if the finished product will be designed to be worn separately, the International Business Times reported. “Current trackers use tiny sensors which penetrate the skin to get a reading, but it is hoped that Apple's solution will negate the need for this. Cook told the students in February how the device alerted him to changes in blood sugar levels in real time, helping him adjust his food intake during each day,” IBT reported. To be sure, Cook also may be seeking a way to rejuvenate interest in the Apple Watch, Reuters recently reported. More than two years after unveiling the Apple Watch with apps and styles that tried to appeal to every need and every customer, Apple has honed its marketing strategy, debuting a second generation product aimed squarely at the health and athletic audience. The focus on fitness will enhance the watch's appeal to its core audience but also cements its status as a niche device, analysts said. “Apple is responding to what has resonated with customers,” said analyst Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research. “The problem is there are only so many people who want to wear a health and fitness device. If they want this to be really massive, they’re going to have to go broader.” The first new device released under Cook, the Apple Watch has not attracted a mass audience, selling 1.6 million units in the second quarter 2016, down more than half from a year ago, in the run-up to the new version, IDC data showed. Apple's original pitch touted the ability to send doodles, make phone calls and track fitness, while the company described it as essentially a fashion accessory. Meanwhile, Apple's next iPhone reportedly will break the $1,000 barrier and send the stock soaring, Goldman Sachs predicts. Goldman Sachs predicts the higher-priced iPhone 8 will drive earnings above expectations. The firm reiterates its buy rating on Apple and raises its price target to $170 from $164. Apple stock was trading at about $153.38 near midday Friday. (Newsmax wires services contributed to this report).

These phones were assembled in India on trial basis in limited quantities,” an industry source told PTI. Apple did not comment on the development. The technology major a couple of days back had said that it was “beginning initial production of a small number of iPhone SE in Bengaluru”.”The high-end India-made iPhones (iPhone SE) have already hit the Indian market.

However, the central government has rejected most of the demands of the US company. Kharge also had said if the Centre was keen on taking on China, it should not give special treatment to Apple alone, but to other players like Samsung and Lenovo also if they are desirous of opening manufacturing units in India. Kharge had said the government should also give companies, including Apple, certain timelines, subsidies and incentives to create a level-playing field.

Tech Industry by Shara Tibken May 18, 2017 12:30 PM PDT @sharatibken Apple's flashy new $5 billion campus, one of the last projects worked on by company co-founder Steve Jobs before his death, has custom-built door handles, thousands of trees and a 100,000-square-foot fitness and wellness facility that boasts a two-story yoga room covered in custom distressed stone. What the campus doesn't have, though, is a day care center. The question people in Silicon Valley are asking is: Should it? "Huge gym but no day care. Apple campus gets it wrong," tweeted longtime tech executive Mitch Kapor, who invests in social impact tech startups through Kapor Capital and the Kapor Center for Social Impact. He declined to comment beyond his tweet but later posted an article about how his old company, Lotus Development Corp., opened a day care center at its offices in 1990. Huge gym but no day care. Apple campus gets it wrong. https://t.co/qcSiAxyfeV /a> — Mitch Kapor (@mkapor) May 17, 2017"> Fellow Lotus pioneer and later Microsoft Chief Software Architect Ray Ozzie also tweeted the story about the Lotus day care and said, "As engineers w/young kids, this is why we loved tech culture c.1990. This is leadership." Quartz called the move a "missed opportunity," while Slate asked, "Shouldn't Apple and companies like it want to set an example that the workplace of the future cares about its employees' families?" Apple didn't respond to several requests for information about why it decided not to include a day care facility at the new Apple Park campus, which opened last month and will hold 12,000 employees, or about what child care benefits it currently offers employees. The company has said it provides backup care to help its workers if their child care (or elder care) providers are unexpectedly not available. But it's unclear if one of the world's best-known and most profitable brands, thanks to its iPhone and iPad, subsidizes regular child care costs. Why is this even a topic of discussion? Because Apple and other tech companies have been working to diversify their workforce, which includes boosting the number of female employees. Under CEO Tim Cook's leadership, Apple has put itself at the front of social issues like LGBT rights, racial equality and the tech industry's need to improve workforce diversity. 12 Apple's next-gen campus nears launch Still, Apple's latest diversity report showed the percentage of women rose only one percentage point from the previous year, to 32 percent. One way to attract women, say experts, is by being more accommodating to families. Apple has added benefits like extended maternity leave, an adoption reimbursement program and egg freezing -- just as other tech companies like Facebook and Intel do. But the lack of onsite day care puzzles some, who say it could restrain the advancement of women at Apple, or limit the number who stick with the company. "At every stage in their careers, women do more housework and child care than men -- and there appears to be a link between the amount of work people do at home and their leadership ambition," according to a joint study conducted by LeanIn.org and McKinsey & Co. Apple has only one woman, retail chief Angela Ahrendts, among its top 11 executives, who meet with Cook each week to set the company's strategy and its product roadmap. In the majority Apple is far from alone when it comes to the day care issue. Only 2 percent of US employers offered subsidized child care centers -- either on the company's campus or nearby -- in 2016, down from 9 percent in 1996, according to an employee benefits survey by the Society for Human Resource Management. Reasons often cited for not having on-campus child care include cost (not a factor for Apple, which has more than $250 billion in cash) and the complications of running a highly regulated facility. States have different rules about the number of caregivers required for a given number of children, and some employers worry about liability (note: operating an on-campus gym also comes with risks and liabilities, so this is a concern that can be overcome). See also Apple says it's mended the pay gap for women, minorities Apple pushes diversity, but progress is slow Futuristic Apple 'spaceship' headquarters to open in April Some also worry that parents will be easily distracted if their kids are so nearby. Samsung didn't have a child care center when it opened its 1.1-million-square-foot office in San Jose, California, in late 2015. And while Facebook's Frank Gehry-designed headquarters in nearby Menlo Park, which opened earlier that same year, doesn't have day care facilities either, the social network does subsidize employees' child care costs. Intel has a contract with an early childhood education provider that gives employees a tuition discount, waives enrollment and registration fees, and provides space for emergency backup child care. The world's largest chipmaker also partners with two family child care networks to cover extended hours not generally served by traditional day care centers. Google, Cisco and Genentech are among the few companies that do offer on-campus child care services. Genentech says its center "allows working parents the flexibility they need while caring for a child and the peace-of-mind they require to know their child is nearby and properly cared for." Cisco says "providing child care options allows our employees to be their best." Good business sense Providing child care benefits to employees isn't just the right thing to do, it also makes sense from a business perspective, experts say. Working parents experience fewer missed days and schedule changes when they get child care assistance. They also work more hours and stay with the same employer longer, according to a January report from Child Care Aware of America. US businesses lose about $4.4 billion each year due to employee absenteeism that results from child care breakdowns, said the group, which promotes national policies and partnerships to advance the development of children. Over a six-month period, 45 percent of parents are absent from work at least once, and miss an average of 4.3 days, due to child care problems, the report said. And 65 percent of parents' work schedules are affected by child care challenges an average of 7.5 times over a six-month period. "Access to high-quality child care increases morale and employer loyalty, but businesses suffer when child care is unavailable for working parents -- to the tune of over $4 billion annually," Lynette M. Fraga, executive director of Child Care Aware of America, said in her organization's 2016 report. Apple's 'spaceship' campus Apple Park lands in April The futuristic campus will have a giant ring-shaped building covered in glass and a theater named after former CEO Steve Jobs. by Lexy Savvides 1:17 Close Drag Autoplay: ON Autoplay: OFF Apple overall isn't as generous with perks as some of its Silicon Valley rivals. Lunch isn't free in its cafeterias, for instance, while companies like Google, Facebook and Dropbox serve gratis gourmet meals to their employees. Staffers also pay to use Apple's gym at its 1 Infinite Loop headquarters in Cupertino, California. It's unclear whether the new megafitness center will be free. Apple had a chance to set an example on child care. We don't know why it decided not to, but experts say other companies shouldn't dismiss the idea. "We need to be able to take care of ourselves and our bodies by having great gyms, but we also have to make sure to have healthy learning environments that are safe for our children," said Julie Kashen, policy director for Make It Work, a national campaign focused on economic justice for women and working families. When it comes to child care, Kashen said, "I think they should do it because it's the right thing to do, and I think they should do it because it's better for their employees and their productivity."

The cases for and against 6 key takeaways from Apple’s Q2 2017 earnings call Video Can the iPhone make better AR than Facebook and Snapchat? | The iPhone Show One of the words I use a lot when reviewing Apple products is opinionated. I firmly believe that great art or design can’t happen without a point of view—and the more you depart from a focused point of view, the more likely a creation will be compromised, workmanlike... good, maybe, but not great. When it’s at its best, Apple strives for greatness. It doesn’t always get there—and every now and then you get the sense it’s not actually trying to get there—but when things are hitting on all cylinders, Apple releases products that are backed by a strong point of view about what will delight and serve its customers. The MacBook, for example, is a product based on a focused vision: That a single port and a slower class of processor are worthy trade-offs for an incredibly thin and light computer with a Retina display. You don’t have to agree with Apple’s take—in the case of the MacBook, the company’s practically daring you to disagree—but you can’t deny that it’s an amazing execution of a particular set of priorities. I’ve been thinking about Apple’s approach to products this week because I read Steven Levy’s excellent inside look at the new Apple Park campus for Wired. It’s worth a read—I highly recommend it, if you haven’t dug in yet. Levy’s been covering Apple longer than just about anyone, and in great detail. In his story about Apple Park, he suggests that the facility itself is an Apple product—in fact, the last product to truly be conceived of by Steve Jobs. (It’s why the story’s headline, “One More Thing”, is so bittersweet.) Here’s a key section: Apple Park is the architectural avatar of the man who envisioned it, the same man who pushed employees to produce those signature products. In the absence of his rigor and clarity, he left behind a headquarters that embodies both his autobiography and his values. The phrase that keeps coming up in talks with key Apple figures is “Steve’s gift.”... The current leaders of Apple are determined not to disappoint him in what is arguably his biggest, and is certainly his last, product launch. “I revere him,” Cook says. “And this was clearly his vision, his concept. Our biggest project ever.” As detailed by Levy, Apple Park is an Apple product through and through. The company took great care to make design decisions, and create custom hardware, at many key points—from the massive glass sheets that required the building of a gigantic furnace, to the toilets, to the handles on the doors, to the pizza boxes in the cafeteria. It’s a one-off product designed by Apple for itself, yes, but it seems to have received the same attention to detail as any other major product launch. (In fact, reading Levy’s story, I wondered to myself if some of Apple’s product sluggishness over the last couple of years might be somehow related to the design energy going into the new campus. Probably not, but you never know. I’m more concerned about the hit in productivity the company may experience when it has to move so many of its employees to new workspaces and allow them some time to adapt to their surroundings.) In the end, Apple’s choices about the materials used in construction and the hardware adorning Apple Park aren’t that important (unless you work there). What does fascinate me is one bit of criticism leveled at the plan, which says a lot about Steve Jobs’s vision for Apple and how it conflicts with the approaches many other tech companies are making: [There are critiques] that the campus is a snobby isolated preserve, at odds with the trendy urbanist school of corporate headquarters. (Amazon, Twitter, and Airbnb are all part of a movement that hopes to integrate tech employees into cities as opposed to having them commute via fuel-gobbling cars or numbing Wi-Fi-equipped buses.) That the layout of the Ring is too rigid... That there is no childcare center. “It’s an obsolete model that doesn’t address the work conditions of the future,” says Louise Mozingo, an urban design professor at UC Berkeley. Steve Jobs’s vision for Apple’s headquarters was to stay close to home, in the low-density suburbs that form Silicon Valley, rather than embrace a more high-density, urban environment. Apple’s never been a city company, from its very start in that suburban garage. Using that as a given—Apple’s a company that isn’t going to stray too far from its suburban roots—Jobs envisioned a hub of activity surrounded by a tranquil park of hills and trees that are reminiscent of the area when it was mostly fruit trees and fields, before it became a major hub of American innovation. Apple’s decision to make Apple Park a ring will be a convenient metaphor for those who wish to criticize the company for being secretive, insular, and arrogant—Levy quotes one critic who calls it a “retrograde cocoon.” There will be more, and worse, when the campus opens and in the years thereafter. Take those criticisms as you will, but anyone who’s visited Apple’s Infinite Loop campus—constructed in 1992-93—will tell you that Apple’s been buildings set in a ring with a large private space in the center for 25 years. Building oases in the middle of South Bay suburbs— this is in Apple’s DNA. Sometimes you need to be true to yourself. I think it’s fair for Levy to note that Apple is not doing what some other major tech companies are doing, and integrating their campuses into urban environments. I was in Seattle earlier this week and got to go past Amazon’s biosphere, where many large office buildings devoted to Amazon are integrated with a weird set of domes and a bustling urban area with shops and restaurants. Twitter moved onto Market Street in San Francisco, and startups have thrived in San Francisco’s South of Market area for years. There’s a lot to be said for embracing urban areas, rather than hiding in the suburbs. From a commuting perspective, the suburban office park is terrible. Apple’s campuses, old and new, are poorly served by public transit, leading the company to create a parallel transit system of fancy Wi-Fi equipped buses. City centers are, in contrast, generally served well by regional transportation systems. A friend of mine recently got a job at Google and was wondering which would be better for her commute-wise—the horror stories of how expensive it is to live in San Francisco (Google has an office building just north of the Bay Bridge) made her assume that the suburban Mountain View campus would be preferable. I had to explain that San Francisco was actually a better location, because it’s served by the regional BART train system as well as ferries from across the bay. It’s hard to imagine Apple colonizing downtown San Francisco, just as it’s hard to imagine Google building its new campus in high-rises in San Jose. I can’t imagine Microsoft decamping from its suburban campus in Redmond, either. Then again, Adobe—who previously occupied what is now the center of the Googleplex—did decamp to new high-rise buildings in San Jose. In the long run, I think it’s a mistake for big companies to build sprawling suburban headquarters in areas poorly served by public transportation. I applaud Twitter and Amazon’s embracing of the urban center. (And Google’s decision to include child care centers in its facilities plans, unlike Apple and Microsoft.) But I understand why building outside of the suburbs was never really a serious option for Apple—or its Seattle cousin Microsoft. Like their co-founders Steve Jobs and Bill Gates, they’re suburban kids who never seem to have really gotten a taste for the big city.

WeChat was allowing readers to tip some certified content providers who publish articles and circulate them via the app. By clicking the “tipping” button at the bottom of these articles, a reader is able to transfer from a few yuan to several hundred yuan from their WeChat Wallet as a reward for the author. However, the function was considered non-compliant with Apple’s in-app purchase rules laid down in June last year, which prohibit apps from including buttons, external links, or other calls to action that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than IAP. Internet giant Tencent was trying to retain the function on WeChat’s iPhone version by providing QR code payments as an alternative, according to a statement published on Wednesday. But in an updated announcement just a few hours later, Tencent said the function was completely shut down for iPhone users. On its official WeChat account, Tencent said it regrettably had to abolish the feature for iPhone users after lengthy negotiations with Apple failed to reach a compromise. Apple said in a statement that WeChat can still allow users to tip as long as it used Apple’s own IAP system. The tipping function remains available to all WeChat accounts on Google’s Android platform and the changes will only apply to the iPhone version of WeChat, according to Tencent. I don’t think it will really affect the current ecosystem but it may make it more difficult for Apple to get new users Kitty Fok, IDC China managing director WeChat was not the only app that embedded tipping functions deemed in violation IAP rules. Most popular live-streaming and gaming apps that could be downloaded in Apple’s App Store offer similar tipping functions but have not yet removed the feature. “The dissension is really about sharing revenue as Apple is missing 30 per cent commission if the tipping function doesn’t go through its IAP,” said IDC China managing director Kitty Fok, adding that the tipping volume on WeChat has grown to be huge. Purchases delivered within the Apple platforms must use Apple’s payment methods and will incur the 30 per cent processing fee, according to the IAP rules set down by the US technology company. By the end of last year, WeChat’s monthly active users had reached 889 million, representing a 28 per cent year-on-year increase, according to Tencent. The number of monthly active mobile payment users on WeChat has surpassed 600 million. “Among the 800 million smartphone users in China, iPhone users are only between 55 and 60 million. I don’t think it will really affect the current ecosystem but it may make it more difficult for Apple to get new users,” Fok said. As of press time, Tencent had not responded to a South China Morning Post query on whether it will consider enabling IAP in its iPhone-version of WeChat at a later stage.

[Photo: Flickr user Jun Seita] By Mark Sullivan5 minute Read If you see the tech world as a competition between major platforms like Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, and Samsung–as I do–Google made several announcements at its I/O developer conference on Wednesday that could affect the balance of power. advertisement As the maker of the second biggest mobile operating system in the world, Apple may be the company Google’s AI advancements impact the most. Many will be watching to see what sorts of AI capabilities Apple announces at its WWDC developer conference coming up June 5. In this season of developer conferences (Microsoft’s Build was just last week), it’s become clear that all the companies that make up Big Tech have been working hard to leverage artificial intelligence in their products. More specifically, scientists and engineers at these companies are teaching computers to talk and see, through technologies such as natural-language processing and machine vision. Many of the things announced here at Google’s conference hit on these dominant AI themes in some way. Google Lens, for example, brings sight to the Google Assistant service, identifying and analyzing images you snap with a smartphone so that the Assistant can act on the data. Lens can read a restaurant menu written in another language and translate it; the Assistant might then provide example pictures of the food choices. There could be a business here as well as a useful tool: For instance, a restaurant might pay Google for the right to display marketing language around the image of its storefront as seen by Lens. I expect the computer-vision aspect of the Assistant to get far more interesting over time. Above Avalon analyst Neil Cybart likes the concept but not the use cases Google chose to showcase it. “It’s not enough to just say you can walk around taking pictures of storefronts to get Yelp ratings,” he says. “It’s fair to assume Apple will be playing in this area going forward.” Google’s Photos app uses AI to pick your best shots, label them, and even suggest people you could share the photos with based on the people it’s recognized in the shots. Another feature makes whole albums full of photos show up in someone else’s Photos app, again based on the people detected in the photos. For many users the new features in Photos might be useful in combating the common problem of having hundreds of memory-using photos on one’s phone and never really using them for anything. advertisement Apple is very likely to talk about how its bringing it AI further into its own Photos app to fix some of the same problems Google fixed, says Global Data analyst Avi Greengart. Apples And Apples? Right now Google appears to be well ahead of Apple in delivering useful AI-powered experiences. Comparing Google AI and Apple AI is relevant because both companies want their apps and services to get as much phone screen time every day as possible. The screens of the more than one billion iOS devices is a big battleground for both companies. Apple wants these devices to spur consumption for its digital services business, which it wants to double in the next four years. It might hurt Apple if Google could leverage superior AI to create more compelling apps and services, says Tech Knowledge analyst Carolina Milanesi. That might cause significant numbers of iPhone users to adopt them, displacing Apple apps. Apple abhors the idea of being just a hardware company; it wants to supply the whole experience, including software and services. And iPhone users do have a choice. Google also announced Wednesday that its Assistant is now available on iOS, as is its Allo messaging app and lots of other Google ware. People who prefer Google’s assistant over Siri can easily use it–although the fact that it’s not built into the operating system means that you can’t wake it by saying “OK Google” as you can on an Android handset. Apples And Oranges Siri is clearly behind other assistants, both in her ability to comprehend and in her ability to act on information she hears from the user. But Siri is just one end point for AI (albeit a big one). To say Apple is “behind” in AI doesn’t quite capture the nuance of the situation. At WWDC, Apple might announce enhancements to the AI behind things like Photos, Maps, and Messages in ways that solve real problems. They might be different than the ones Google and others have used AI to solve. advertisement As Moor Insights & Strategy analyst Patrick Moorhead points out, Apple doesn’t like to be forced into pushing out new products or services purely because of competitive pressure, and it has rarely done so. It has lots of people working on AI, but is being very thoughtful about where and how it exposes it. Apple also isn’t likely to talk as loudly about AI as Google does. Google, after all, is a software and services company–you’d expect it to focus on AI. Apple is mainly a hardware company (and, yes, increasingly a services company). It’s more likely to focus on functionality that AI helps improve, rather than dwelling much on technical underpinnings. Apple Vs. Google One clear advantage Google enjoys in AI is access to lots of personal user data that it pulls from services such as Google Docs, Gmail, and Google Calendar. Google will leverage as much user data as privacy concerns permit to help the Google Assistant become an expert on the user’s life, something like the way human assistants become more valuable as they learn more and more. For example, the Assistant running on the Google Home smart speaker could notify you that traffic on the way to your next appointment is bad, and to allot extra time. It might know that a flight listed in an email has been delayed and alert the user to that. Apple, by contrast, has shunned collecting personal data because of privacy and security concerns. There’s no doubting that’s a good thing from a privacy perspective, but it might hinder the company from arming Siri with the information she needs to be an expert on the user’s life. Apple, however, has more control over the chips running the on-device AI computations on its gadgets than Google does. Apple is highly competent in optimizing chips–which it designes itself–for the needs of its own software. Apple may simply be able to leverage more computing power in its devices than Google can in third-party Android devices. Some AI computation can happen in the cloud, but that costs milliseconds and could raise security risks. After watching this week’s announcements about the new AI powers in Google’s assistant, I’m reminded that there’s far more to releasing winning apps and services than sheer technological prowess. Google has on numerous occasions released products that were technically impressive but betrayed a woeful misunderstanding of what people might find useful (Google Wave, Google Glass, etc.). advertisement Apple doesn’t need to demonstrate superiority over Google in the pure science part of artificial intelligence. It can win by coupling its AI chops with a superior understanding of how people will best benefit from AI in day-to-day life.

Farr goes on: At the University of Glasgow, he reiterated Apple’s commitment to the health space and spoke about the struggles faced by people with diabetes. “It’s mentally anguishing to stick yourself many times a day to check your blood sugar,” he said. “There is lots of hope out there that if someone has constant knowledge of what they’re eating, they can instantly know what causes the response… and that they can adjust well before they become diabetic.” I spoke to a friend of mine with diabetes last night. Devices like this that offer continuous glucose monitoring without the need for sticking one’s self exists, can be bulky and uncomfortable. If you are already wearing a pump, having another device, to quote my friend “can be just too much.” However, if a future Apple Watch can track this, it could open up continuous monitoring to more people. It seems like a very Apple-like thing to tackle, despite previous comments from Apple that they don’t want to have the Watch tangled up in FDA approval.

"We have a very nice uptrend going on in the Apple chart," Gordon said Thursday on CNBC's "Trading Nation." "We have a nice little pullback here it can compare against — a nice little $4 drop, give or take — and we're seeing a similar $4 to $5 drop here in Apple," he said. Specifically, Gordon is referring to a modest pullback in the stock from early to mid-April, in which Apple shares dipped from about $144 per share to about $140 per share. Since mid-April, Apple has come back, rallying more than 7 percent to its current levels. To capitalize on a move higher, Todd is putting on a trade known as a short put spread. He is selling the 152.5-strike put expiring on May 26, while hedging his exposure by buying the 150-strike put expiring on the same date. This trade will offer him a credit of 91 cents per share, or $91 per options spread. So long as Apple stays above $152.50 — which is just about where it closed on Thursday — Gordon will get to keep all of that money. If Apple closes below $151.59 on May 26, the trade will begin to show losses. And if Apple closes at or below $150, the trader will see his maximum loss of $1.59. While the trade technically has an unfavorable risk-to-reward setup, this structure allows for a "margin for error" that will allow him to profit as long as the stock at least stays flat. Gordon added that since options prices on Apple are at elevated levels, selling options, rather than buying them, is a superior way to express one's thesis. To be sure, dips in Apple are rare this year, but have been quite frequent in past years. The stock dipped more than 11 percent from mid-October to mid-November last year and the shares declined for the full year in 2015. But in both cases, the stock eventually rebounded to new highs.

Apple Chief Financial Officer, Luca Maestri, set tongues wagging when he claimed the company had just set a “new enterprise revenue record”, though he didn’t say why. I thought I’d try to explain it for him. BYO Apple Digital transformation is the dominant story of today – not just in IT, but everywhere else as well. History will show that almost every part of life was impacted by mobile technology, and Apple’s guaranteed place in tomorrow’s enterprise is just one component of this. The iPhone spawned the Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) revolution, one which itself spawned empowered workforces demanding choice: Choice in platform, choice in software, choice in working hours. Flexibility is everything – and it’s generating some weird ironies: retailers don’t run shops any more, they manage “experiences”; customer service is escaping from the call center to develop authentic voices in a sea of bots; conferences are as likely to be virtual as real. Even agricultural production is managed remotely using smartphones. There are iPads in our homes, offices, airplanes and above the sky. We’re connected, and, when it comes to the enterprise, Apple has become synonymous with mobile tech. Mobile everything “Businesses everywhere are becoming digital, software driven, and we believe ultimately - mobile centric. And it's not just consumer services. It's every industry and vertical on the planet,” Rowan Trollope, Cisco’s SVP GM of IoT and Applications Group told me last year. “Apple offers the most innovative mobile technology in the world combined with the world’s most advanced mobile OS,” he also said. According to Good Technology's Mobility Index Report, iPhone accounted for 72% of all enterprise smartphone activations during the first quarter while iPad accounted for 81 percent of tablet activations. The JAMF annual survey reveals similar sets of statistics, with 91 percent of organizations are now using Mac and 99 percent on iPad and iPhone. "All our products continue to be extremely popular and drive more buying transformation in the enterprise market. We set a new enterprise revenue record for the March quarter, and we expect this momentum to continue for the remainder of the year….Corporate buyers reported a 96 percent satisfaction rate and a purchase intent of 68 percent for the June quarter,” said Maestri. Why is this happening? There are lots of good reasons that Apple has been able to secure its position in the enterprise. Six easy reasons include Apple’s first mover advantage, ease of deployment and device configuration, Exchange support, constructive relationships with Microsoft, Cisco, Deloitte, IBM and others, and industry-leading lack of fragmentation. Another is the user demographic and their loyalty: While Android-as-a-platform has a larger market share, when it comes to enterprise deployment Apple has the hearts and minds of the high-end smartphone user – and a 92 percent loyalty among those customers. 8 more reasons include: Expense: Based on a major deployment of 90,000 Macs, IBM now claims it costs three times as much to manage Windows PCs as it does Macs. Support: iOS 10 runs happily on iPhone 5, released in September 2012. Other platforms don’t provide support for anything like as long, posing pressure on enterprise IT budgets. Security: Apple’s platforms are certainly not immune to cyberattack – but they are regularly patched and seldom subverted. In contrast, some people claim an example of new Android malware is identified every ten seconds. Partnerships: Apple and its integration partners are securing a range of massive deals, not least the recently announced decision by Volkswagen to standardize on use of iPhones across the corporation (reaching a potential 620,000 employees), and Capital One’s purchase of iPhones, Macs and Apple Watch for employees. Santander Bank just agreed to deploy over 11,000 iOS devices across the company. United Airlines has deployed 50,000 iOS devices. Enterprise sales: Apple’s integration partners are putting tonnes of effort into evangelizing the company’s solutions to the sector. IBM’s MobileFirst iOS strategy continues to bear fruit (around c.3k businesses are now using IBM/iOS apps). Deloitte has assigned a colossal 5,000 people to focus on Apple integrations for its enterprise clients and is working to secure over 100 big new opportunities. Cisco is also working to evangelize Apple in the enterprise. Developers: To boost its enterprise share, Apple is pushing outside of its own sizable developer community. SAP recently released a tool that makes it much easier for SAP developers to write business solutions for iOS. Smaller groups, including WWT Asynchrony, are also climbing aboard. Compromise, and the lack of it: Apple has worked hard to break out of some of the preconceptions levelled against it by critics. It is working with partners, opening up key API’s to enable solutions integration and development, and working to secure its systems and data integrity with improvements such as Apple File System. This means an enterprise user can look forward to the same quality ease-of-use as a consumer can expect from an Apple system, but boosted by security, performance, and integration advantages pros demand. Mobility Partner Program: Apple also has its own scheme in which it works with developers and master systems integrators to weave its solutions into enterprise deployments. Servicing success iPad Pro sales to enterprise users are on the rise despite the hype around Surface. 76 percent of organizations claim to have seen an increase in iPad and iPhone adoption, 74 percent are experiencing uptick in Mac use across their organization over the previous year. With so many enterprise employees using their devices for both work and play, Apple’s growing services revenue is also likely to see an uptick as the enterprise transformation continues.

To cap off its celebrations, Apple yesterday held a concert at its headquarters with Stevie Wonder… Spigen TEKA RA200 Airpods Earhooks Cover Apple held the concert as part of its annual “Beer Bash” festivities, which in the past have featured artists such as Pharrell Williams and Zane Lowe. A plethora of images have emerged on social media showing the gathering of Apple executives and employees for the concert, which was kept a surprise until the day of. Stevie Wonder, who has been legally blind since shortly after birth, has praised Apple’s Accessibility features in the past. In 2011, the musician thanked Stevie Jobs for Apple’s focus on ensuring that everyone can use its products. “There is nothing that you can do on the iPhone or iPad that I can’t do,” he said. Furthermore, Wonder starred in Apple’s annual holiday advertisement. In the ad, he was seen using the macOS VoiceOver feature to produce a song in GarageBand. Check out that ad below. Earlier this week, Apple released a new series of videos highlighting people with disabilities who use its products, while Tim Cook also sat down with three different YouTubers to discuss Apple’s Accessibility efforts. A variety of different images of Stevie Wonder’s performance at Apple can be seen via Twitter and Instagram and are embedded right below.

He’s made it so that his jailbroken iPhone responds to NFC-enabled devices. Thus far, Limneos has tested his hack with NFC-enabled tags, but the proof of concept holds promise for jailbroken iPhone users. The best wireless keyboard for the Mac? In a brief video, the well-known developer showcases a jailbroken iPhone 6s interacting with an NFC-enabled tag. The phone promptly responds to the presence of the tag with a notification identifying the tag. Limneos states that his efforts, which consists of a small hack on the nfcd daemon, should work on any jailbroken device that is NFC-enabled. He’s currently still digging deeper into NFC protocols, and working on managing read/write data. Right now, as you can see from the embedded video demo below, the hack is capable of reading tags and can be used to authenticate. The developer states that you could use the hack to open an RFID door with your iPhone, or move a tag close to your iPhone and have it respond with an action. Android users have, for many years now, been able to reap the benefits of having unlocked NFC access on their smartphones. This allows, for instance, users to quickly pair NFC-enabled cameras, speakers, and transmit files between users. Apple first implemented NFC into the iPhone 6 as a way to help facilitate Apple Pay transactions, and has given no indication that it plans on opening up access to developers. I personally think that it’s unlikely that Apple will ever open up NFC, as HomeKit is its primary method for communicating with devices in and around the home, and NFC is exclusively used with Apple Pay. For security, and perhaps other reasons, I see Apple continuing to keep NFC access locked down in its devices, and that’s probably a wise move given its association with Apple Pay. As 9to5Mac’s Benjamin Mayo explained to me, another incentive for Apple to keep NFC locked down has to do with speed. Since NFC is used exclusively with Apple Pay, when an iPhone senses any NFC device nearby, it automatically displays the Apple Pay interface. The iPhone doesn’t have to take time to decipher what device is on the other end, and that, in effect, results in a speedier Apple Pay experience. Limneos plans to release his work as an NFC-enabler tweak rather than a particular application. It will be available on the Cydia store for jailbroken iPhone users in the near future.

Apple said that third-party AAA batteries, bought separately by the woman, were the cause … NordVPN Adelaide Now reports that the incident happened in February, with Apple subsequently investigating. An Australian woman whose face, hands and hair were burned when her headphones exploded on a plane won’t be compensated by manufacturer Apple because third-party batteries were at fault. The woman, who wishes to remain anonymous, was napping on a Beijing to Melbourne flight in February when she was awoken by the sound of an explosion and a burning sensation on her face. “Our investigation indicated the issue was caused by a third-party battery,” an Apple representative said in a statement issued by the woman’s lawyers on Friday. A number of Beats wireless headphone models use AAA batteries. The brand of the batteries involved in this case is not known. The woman said she was disappointed by Apple’s decision. The headphones don’t work without batteries, yet nowhere on the headphones – or their packaging – did it specify which brand of batteries should be used. An iPhone 6 caught fire on board a flight to Hawaii last year. Ben Lovejoy @benlovejoy Ben Lovejoy is a British technology writer and EU Editor for 9to5Mac.

The tech giant's manufacturing partners have been producing a 10.5-inch iPad Pro since March, and are currently producing around 500,000 units per month, DigiTimes is reporting, citing people who claim to have knowledge of the activity. Apple has asked its manufacturing partners to boost production on the tablet to 600,000 units in July, and anticipates shipping 5 million to 6 million units through the end of the year, according to the report. However, DigiTimes' Apple reports aren't always right, so its latest report should be viewed with that context. The report follows months of speculation that Apple (aapl) is planning a big iPad update this year. The company announced the new iPad in March, featuring a 9.7-inch screen and improved processing power. But Apple is said to be working on bigger updates to its professionally focused iPad Pro line. Chief among those updates, according to several rumors, is a 10.5-inch iPad Pro. Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter Apple currently sells a 9.7-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pro. Both devices run on the company's iOS mobile operating system and support the Apple Pencil stylus for digitally writing on the screen. Apple is reportedly planning a 10.5-inch screen that would fit into a chassis about the same size as the 9.7-inch iPad Pro. Apple would be able to achieve that by reducing the size of the bezels around the screen, according to reports. It's unknown what other features the 10.5-inch iPad Pro might offer, if it even exists at all. There is also some speculation around the Internet whether Apple might decide to eliminate the 9.7-inch iPad Pro and replace it with the 10.5-inch option or keep all three models. Although Apple has remained silent on its plans, the company is rumored to be planning an iPad unveiling at its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) keynote on June 5.

Tech Search Search FitbitU.S. Charges Virginia Man in Fitbit Stock Hoax On LeadingGE’s Jeff Immelt: “Everybody Hated Me, Everybody” DroneYou No Longer Have to Register Your Drone White HousePresident Trump Dominated Media Coverage in First 100 Days, Study Says Best Companies Apple Reportedly Facing Trouble Over Tipping on Chinese Apps Don Reisinger May 19, 2017 Apple is apparently in some hot water in China over some changes the company is making to a popular mobile app feature. The iPhone maker last month informed a host of Chinese app developers, including those who operate popular messages services like WeChat, that they would need to disable "tip" functions in their programs, The Wall Street Journal is reporting, citing conversations with those companies. Apple said that the tipping features, which let users send money to other people through the apps, was in violation of its App Store rules, the report says. If the companies wanted to keep tipping in their apps, Apple would start collecting 30% on all cash transfers, the Journal's sources say. According to the Journal, the Chinese app developers it spoke to aren't happy with Apple's (aapl) decision. They argued that the tipping function, which wasn't previously subject to Apple's revenue-sharing model, keeps people using their apps. In most cases, an app user will create something he or she shares with other users. To commend them on a job well done or aid their creation, other users can tip them the sum of their choosing. The cash is immediately transferred between the parties and the app makers don't make any money off the tip. Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter Apple has for nearly a decade shared revenue on all purchases with app developers. In most cases, the split is 70-30, with app developers taking the larger share. Apple has extended its revenue-sharing model to in-app purchases and even subscriptions to app services. Developers who don't like the idea of sharing 30% of their revenue with Apple have no choice but to accept it or remove their apps from the company's application marketplace. The Chinese developers who spoke to the Journal, however, said that the tipping function is different, since they don't actually generate revenue on those user transfers. In its discussion with the developers, Apple took a serious tone, according to the Journal's sources. The iPhone maker said that they would need to comply with its demands or face the possibility of app updates not hitting the marketplace, according to the report. Apple even reportedly warned that it could remove their apps from its App Store. The Journal didn't say what the app developers will do in response to Apple's demands. Apple, which did not immediately respond to a Fortune request for comment on the Journal's report, is making those requests against a troubling backdrop in China. The country was once Apple's biggest operating segment. But as demand for Apple's products has shrunk in China, the company's revenue has plummeted. The Greater China operating segment saw revenue slide 14% during Apple's fiscal second quarter ended April 1. It was the only region that suffered a revenue decline for Apple. It's now the third-largest Apple market behind the Americas and Europe divisions.

Google Assistant comes to iPhone, adds alerts, hands-free calling & more Google's virtual assistant gains a number of new features and expands to Apple's iPhone as competition for Siri & Cortana. Matt McGee on May 17, 2017 at 3:29 pm More Google Assistant was one of the stars of Wednesday’s keynote at I/O 2017. It’s gained a number of new features and expanded beyond its Android-based roots. As expected, Google is making Assistant available on the iPhone, where it’ll compete with Apple’s built-in Siri — the original smartphone assistant — and Microsoft’s Cortana, which has its own iOS app. Assistant will be a standalone app that’s compatible with iPhones running iOS 9.1 or better. Assistant is also getting a number of new features that I’ll describe below. Notifications: Home will alert users when it has important information to share, beginning with things like traffic delays, flight statuses and reminders. The device won’t talk on its own but will light up when an alert is ready — much like the Alexa notifications that Amazon just announced for its devices. Type to Assistant: Recognizing that not every situation is appropriate for talking out loud, users will be able to communicate with Assistant by typing on the phone. Integration with Lens: Assistant will work in unison with Google Lens, the company’s new AI-based visual search tool also announced at I/O today. Users will be able to use Assistant to learn more and take actions on images they photograph with Lens (as shown below). Hands-free calling: This is months away, but users in the US and Canada will be able to use Assistant to place hands-free calls through Home devices to any mobile or landline phone. New entertainment options: Spotify’s free music service is coming soon to Assistant/Home, to complement the existing access that Spotify’s paid users have. SoundCloud and Deezer are also coming soon to Home. On the video side, Assistant/Home will be able to let you watch HBO Now, HGTV, CBS All Access and other providers on your connected TVs. Visual responses: Speaking of connected TVs, later this year Assistant will be able to send visual responses to television screens with Chromecast. Google’s examples included seeing upcoming Google Calendar events on TV. The big push, according to Google’s Scott Huffman, is to make Assistant and Home more conversational and more helpful with tasks. Huffman said that nearly 70 percent of the queries that Assistant sees are asked in natural language, not with keywords like people use when doing traditional Google searches.

"Apple’s evangelists are beginning to lose their faith", the report's authors suggest. One reason being that Apple has failed to maintain its technological advantage and new devices just haven't caught on with consumers like earlier gadgets did. Its value has dropped 27 percent year-on-year.  This leaves Google as the MVP of the brand world with an estimated worth of close to $110 billion (+24 percent).

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Site Archive Health Strong program brings fun and fitness to local students Friday May 19, 2017 at 7:58 AM May 19, 2017 at 7:58 AM Monica Solano Staff Writer @DP_MonicaInes APPLE VALLEY — Laughter filled the air at Yucca Loma Elementary School as children of all ages participated in a day of fun and healthy living in the final Health Strong event of the school year Thursday. A monthly program where students participate in a variety of fun, heart-pumping activities, enjoy a healthy snack and learn more about the benefits of living a healthy lifestyle, Health Strong is equal parts fun and educational.    “I had so much fun,” said Isabel Brandon, 8, of Apple Valley. “But I got so tired from running and yelling and cheering on my friends so much.” Sponsored by local businesses Stine Chiropractic and Finish Line Tire and Automotive, the program relies on volunteers from Apple Valley High School's HOSA program and parent volunteers to help students participate in 45-minute sessions by grade level. "The intent of the program was to educate the elementary school kids about health, wellness and exercise,” said Susan Fansler, spokesperson for Stine Chiropractic. "We figured if we started in elementary schools and do it monthly, through repetition the kids would get it and would be able to bring what they learn into junior high and high school." According to Fransler, the program has been hosting the event at Yucca Loma for the past two-and-a-half years, teaching students and their parents that they don't have to join a gym or play a sport to get exercise and be fit. While "it has been challenging" to gain sponsors for the program, Fansler said Health Strong has also been hosted at the Challenger School of Sports and Fitness in Victorville for about a year and there are hopes to bring it to other schools in the future. “It’s great to see the kids get so excited for when the program comes by every year and students will come up and give me a hug telling me they had lots of fun,” said Family Care Director Valerie Smith. “It’s also wonderful to see our community coming out and encouraging them to have fun in a healthy manner.” While some students put their skills to the test playing with Hula-Hoops and Skip-It’s, others ran through tires and walked on balancing beams while attempting to balance a book on their head as each class rotated from station to station. A “Most Spirited” award was also handed out to the class of each grade level who showed the most school and healthy spirit. “I really liked running through the tires because it reminded me of football when they would jump and run in the tires when they train,” said Amari Hinds, 8, of Apple Valley. “Exercise is good for the body and we have fun.” Fansler said the program would not be possible without the passion of business owners Gabriel Stine of Stine Chiropractic and Tracy Reibeling of Finish Line. "We're really lucky to have people who care enough about the kids to sponsor these programs in our community,” Fansler said. — Staff Writer Charity Lindsey contributed to this story.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile You won’t have to wait until November to buy Apple’s next-gen iPhone 8 Image Source: Moe Slah, ConceptsiPhone Yoni Heisler @edibleapple May 19th, 2017 at 9:47 AM Share Tweet For as popular as the iPhone already is, Apple’s iconic smartphone will take things to the next level once the iPhone 8 is released later this year. Said to feature a sleek new redesign with an edge-to-edge display, the iPhone 8 will likely spur the largest and most significant upgrade cycle Apple has seen yet. After all, seeing as how the iPhone form factor has more or less remained unchanged since the 2014 release of the iPhone 6, current iPhone owners have been pining for something fresh and different for years now. And for anyone curious about the iPhone 8 form factor, we recently posted exclusive photos of what the final iPhone 8 design will likely look like. Don't Miss: Apple’s iPhone 8 will basically bring back the headphone jack With the excitement for the iPhone 8 building with each passing week, there have been a few worrisome reports claiming that the device might be subject to significant delays. In fact, a handful of reports have even claimed that Apple might push back the iPhone 8 release date all the way to November. Even some of the more optimistic reports we’ve seen have said that the iPhone 8 might not see the light of day until October. Regarding the reasons behind the rumored delay, there have been rumblings that Apple has seen poor yields when manufacturing the iPhone 8’s advanced OLED display. Additionally, there have been indications that some of Apple’s partners responsible for supplying some of the iPhone 8’s more advanced components won’t be able to ramp up supply in time for a September launch. Not to worry, we’re finally starting to see reports which suggest that the pessimism surrounding the iPhone 8 release date may have been blown out of proportion. Either that, or Apple and its partners in recent weeks managed to get a firm grasp on production problems. Regardless, anyone interested in picking up Apple’s flagship iPhone 8 won’t necessarily have to wait until November to do so. According to a new research note from Morgan Stanley, the iPhone 8 will hit store shelves during a normal time frame, which is to say that it will likely be released sometime in mid-late September. Specifically, Morgan Stanley relays that it has found no evidence of ongoing production problems or delays in Apple’s supply chain. Seeking Alpha notes: Reports of low yields for components have shaken some investors, but “Morgan Stanley’s Greater China Technology Research colleagues have not yet seen delays in the supply chain and still expect new iPhone production to start on time for most of the components (including OLED),” the firm says. Morgan Stanley’s recent note corroborates noted leaker OnLeaks’ prediction that mass production will begin in earnest this Summer ahead of a planned launch in September. According to my sources: DVT started last month. PVT will start between June and July. Final mass production in August for September launch. https://t.co/2M2YyMjyi8 — OnLeaks (@OnLeaks) May 11, 2017 Of course, we can pretty much expect to see the iPhone 8 be supply-constrained at launch, a September release date notwithstanding. While this will undoubtedly be frustrating to many, it simply par for the course anytime Apple releases a new iPhone, and especially when Apple introduces a brand new iPhone design with incredibly advanced components. Remember, aside from a new form factor, the iPhone 8 will reportedly incorporate advanced camera modules that will provide support for facial recognition and augmented reality.

Patently Apple posted a report way back in December titled "Softbank to Invest $50 Billion in the U.S. to create 50,000 new Tech Jobs and Somehow Foxconn is Included in the Deal." A part of that investment will be used by Foxconn later this year. Softbank's chief who made the pitch to President Trump is now joining the President on his trip to Saudi Arabia.   According to a new Reuters report, "Some six months after his visit to Donald Trump's Manhattan mansion cheered investors, Masayoshi Son, Japan's richest man, is set to follow his friend to Saudi Arabia as the new U.S. president makes his first overseas trip since taking office.   Son, head of Japan's SoftBank Group, travels to Riyadh this weekend where he is expected to announce the close of the first fundraising round for what will be the world's biggest private equity fund, backed by Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund and Apple Inc." On May 12 Patently Apple posted a report titled "Apple Awards Corning First Investment from their Advanced Manufacturing Fund as Promised."   Reuters further noted that Masayoshi Son's "appearance in the Saudi capital and the expected launch of the $100 billion Vision Fund coincide with Trump's official visit to the kingdom, one leg of a presidential trip that also includes Israel, Belgium and Italy.   Son describes the fund as essential for setting up SoftBank for a data "gold rush" which he expects to happen as the global economy becomes increasingly digitized.   Son is scheduled to attend a forum of global chief executives in Riyadh on Saturday to be held on the sidelines of the Trump visit, a list of attendees showed.

Tim Cook might already have access to a next-level Apple Watch feature. Image: Jose Sanchez/AP/REX/Shutterstock By Brett Williams2017-05-19 14:26:00 UTC Apple CEO Tim Cook will be the first to tell you — he loves the Apple Watch and its health tracking capabilities. So if there's anyone who would serve as a high-profile guinea pig for a breakthrough new feature for the device, Cook's a top candidate. Which is why it may come as no surprise that Cook has been spotted out and around on Apple's campus sporting a specialized version of the Watch, according to a report from CNBC. Connected to Cook's Watch is a new device that is said to be a prototype of a glucose-tracker, which is rumored to be in development for a future version of the wearable. Apple's many mouthpieces will be the first to tell you about how the company is working to revolutionize the world — but this feature has the potential to be truly life-changing. The addition of a non-invasive blood-sugar tracker to the Watch's toolkit could be a real, immediate breakthrough for the millions of people around the world living with diabetes.  SEE ALSO: Apple, please don't kill the iPad mini This is far from the first time we've heard about the potential for a glucose-monitoring Watch feature. Apple reportedly has an entire team of scientists hard at work on the tech's development, which could come in the form of modular Watch bands or some other external add-on to the device.    The glucose monitoring function would do more than just add another health-centric feature to the world's best-selling wearable — it would make it an essential medical device for anyone with diabetes. Today, those people are forced to track their glucose through a variety of more invasive means, like pricking their fingers for blood tests. Cook has admitted that he's worn a glucose monitor before, so this report does carry some extra weight. He told a group of University of Glasgow students about his experience wearing such a device in February, CNBC reports, and reiterated the lengths that people who live with diabetes go through every day in order to monitor their blood sugar using conventional means.    There's no doubt that Apple is focused on bringing health tech to the masses via the Watch — Cook said as much in February. "This is an area where I'm very excited about Apple's contribution," he told the group. "Very excited."

The company has announced that a software update will allow its entire fleet from that year to use both Android Auto and CarPlay. Android Auto supports phones running Android 5.0 (Lollipop) or higher. While you can take your car to a dealer to do the update for you, that isn’t necessary as there are a couple of DIY options … You can download the update from Ford’s owner support website, but it will also be the first over the air update for Sync, meaning users with Wi-Fi enabled vehicles will be able to download it directly: Customers can update their software by visiting owner.ford.com to download and install with a USB drive, or by visiting a dealership. Customers with Wi-Fi-enabled vehicles and a Wi-Fi network can set up their vehicle to receive the update automatically. Android Auto is already available on all 2017 models, and this update brings the platform to around 800,000 additional vehicles. If your car doesn’t have a manufacturer-supported Android Auto option, there are aftermarket receivers available with pricing starting in the $300 range and Pioneer added five new models just yesterday that support both Android Auto and Apple’s CarPlay. Ford SYNC 3 Update Brings Android Auto and Apple CarPlay Software Support to 2016 Vehicles Ford SYNC 3 software update brings support for Android Auto™ and Apple CarPlay to model-year 2016 vehicles Customers can update by downloading the software to a USB drive, visiting a dealership or over-the-air via a Wi-Fi connection This is Ford’s first software update via Wi-Fi and offers a convenient and automated alternative to existing upgrade methods DEARBORN, Mich., May 19, 2017 – Ford is making Android Auto and Apple CarPlay software support available to model-year 2016 vehicles equipped with SYNC 3. Customers with model-year 2016 Ford vehicles can update to the new SYNC 3 version 2.2 by downloading to a USB drive, visiting a dealership or automatically through a Wi-Fi connection. “Our SYNC 3 software platform was designed to be easy to update so we can get our customers the latest and greatest features, functionally and security enhancements,” said Don Butler, executive director, Ford Connected Vehicle and Services. “With over-the-air updates, we can deliver new features to customers in the background while they continue using their vehicles.” Customers can update their software by visiting owner.ford.com to download and install with a USB drive, or by visiting a dealership. Customers with Wi-Fi-enabled vehicles and a Wi-Fi network can set up their vehicle to receive the update automatically. Android Auto Compatible with Android™ devices 5.0 and higher, Android Auto brings the Android experience into the vehicle safely and easily with Google Maps, Google Play Music, phone, messaging and third party apps projected on the car’s built-in display and available via voice controls. With a simplified interface, large touch targets, Google voice search and easy-to-use voice controls, Android Auto is designed to minimize distraction while on the road. Android, Android Auto, Google Maps and Google Play are trademarks of Google Inc. Apple CarPlay Compatible with iPhone 5 and later models running iOS 7.1 or higher, Apple CarPlay gives iPhone users an intuitive way to make phone calls, use voice-guided navigation, listen to music, and send and receive messages while staying focused on the road. Users can control Apple CarPlay through the in-vehicle display or via Siri voice control. Apple CarPlay support requires a USB hub upgrade available through Ford dealers. SYNC 3 currently supports Android Auto and Apple CarPlay on all model-year 2017 Ford cars including the Fiesta, Focus, Fusion and Mustang, SUVs including the Escape, Explorer and Expedition, F-Series trucks and Ford’s electrified vehicles. Receiving updates over Wi-Fi Though Ford has been issuing SYNC upgrades since 2009, this is the first time the company is offering an update via Wi-Fi. In Wi-Fi-enabled vehicles with Automatic System Updates turned on within SYNC 3, the system will periodically connect to a customer’s designated Wi-Fi network to check for updates. If an update is available, the system automatically downloads the update in the background over a period of time without any customer interaction. And SYNC 3 is designed to perform the update as long as Wi-Fi is connected prior to the vehicle turning off, therefore there is no need to keep the vehicle running for the update to take place.

One reason being that Apple has failed to maintain its technological advantage and new devices just haven’t caught on with consumers like earlier gadgets did. Its value has dropped 27 percent year-on-year. This leaves Google as the MVP of the brand world with an estimated worth of close to $110 billion (+24 percent). This has to do with the fact that Google remains largely unchallenged in its core internet search business, which generates heavy advertising revenue. source: statista click on infographic to enlarge Tags With: Amazonapplebrandfacebookgooglemicrosoftsamsung ← Watch President Trump mispronounce Erdogan’s name repeatedly (video) Turkey blocks off Rhodes airport for military exercise! → May, 19 2017 IMF head Lagarde optimistic over Greek debt May, 19 2017 Congress to IMF: Leave the Greek program!

The upstream supply chain's shipments for Apple's new 10.5-inch iPad Pro have been increasing recently and the device's monthly shipment volume is expected to grow to 600,000 units in July, up from around 500,000 units currently, helping its annual shipments to reach five million units in 2017, according to some market watchers. The 10.5-inch iPad Pro began mass production in March-April. Demand for Apple's new 9.7-inch iPad is expected to pick up at the end of the quarter and reach a peak in the third quarter, resulting in an increase to over 4 million units shipped in June and July. Apple's 12.9-inch iPad Pro is rumored for an update this year with mass production beginning as early as June and stable shipments in Q3. The iPad mini 4 could be phased out as previously predicted. Despite the new devices, Apple is expecting to ship less tablets this year than last.

Society Economy Sport Arts & Showbiz Overview    News    Articles    Interviews  Calendar Invalid query Apple CEO Tim Cook spotted test-driving a glucose monitor May 19, 2017 - 17:01 AMT PanARMENIAN.Net - Tim Cook has been spotted at the Apple campus test-driving a device that tracks blood sugar, which was connected to his Apple Watch, CNBC reports. A source said that Cook was wearing a prototype glucose-tracker on the Apple Watch, which points to future applications that would make the device a "must have" for millions of people with diabetes -- or at risk for the disease. As CNBC reported last month, Apple has a team in Palo Alto working on the "holy grail" for diabetes: Non-invasive and continuous glucose monitoring. The current glucose trackers on the market rely on tiny sensors penetrating the skin. Sources said the company is already conducting feasibility trials in the Bay Area. Tim Cook also talked about the device to a roomful of students in February at the University of Glasgow, where he received an honorary degree. He didn't say if it was a medical device from a company like Medtronic or Dexcom, or an Apple prototype. "I've been wearing a continuous glucose monitor for a few weeks," he said. "I just took it off before coming on this trip." Cook explained that he was able to understand how his blood sugar responded to foods he was eating. He made modifications to keep his blood sugar more constant. In Silicon Valley, a huge health trend is low-carb, high fat diets. Increasingly, venture capitalists and executives are finding that if they cut down their sugar consumption, they see dramatic results including increased productivity and weight loss. Cook has a lot of interest in personal health. For instance, he's also an active gym-goer, and recently told CNBC's Jim Cramer that he has lost 30 pounds. Related links: CNBC.

Yet, the long-awaited iOS 10.3.1 jailbreak is still nowhere to be found. This prompted words to spread that the iOS 10 jailbreak is just a big hoax and that Pangu could simply not crack Apple’s code. Should you upgrade to 10.3.2? iOS 10.3.2 update is packed with security improvements and bug fixes and is a major point update despite not including any new features. One of the deal breakers in this update is that it will break any jailbroken devices, so you might want to hold off installing it if you are eagerly waiting for the iOS 10.3.1 jailbreak tool, according to Forbes. But on that note, you have to be careful with your web browsing as Apple had listed 23 categories of exploit that were discovered, of which more than 20 are WebKit-related. iOS 10.3.2 contains important security updates, so the ultimate advice is to install it as soon as possible. For jailbreak enthusiasts, note also that the rumored release of an iOS 10.3.1 jailbreak tool has not come to fruition and remains uncertain. According to The Bitbag, some people believe that Pangu was never really able to make an iOS 10 jailbreak tool. It promised before that it will release the tool after Apple rolled out the latest OS version, but with the delays, some take it as just a big lie. Jailbreak teams giving up? “I am done with jailbreaking.” The latest working iOS jailbreak tool is Yalu, developed by Luca Todesco, a popular Italian iOS hacker. The Yalu Jailbreak website said that the Yalu tool has been updated to support iOS 10.3.1 jailbreak, but after that, Todesco announced he would no longer work on any iOS jailbreaking tool. He wrote on Twitter that if you like jailbreaking, you should save your blobs and just stay to 10.2.1 and added, “I am done with jailbreaking.” Whether it means that Todesco will stop doing a jailbreak tool for public consumption and continue working on it in private or stop jailbreaking altogether was not clear. 1. Save blobs 2. If you're currently on 10.2.1 stay on it if you want to jailbreak. 3. I am done with jailbreaking. — qwertyoruiop (@qwertyoruiopz) March 27, 2017 Apple is surely giving hackers a hard time cracking its code, releasing updates one after another at an unprecedented rate. With 10.3.2 version already seeded to developers, jailbreakers face another setback. Droid Report said Pangu is giving it another shot, probably the last one, to release a 10.3.1 tool during a conference. But it should be noted that it happened last year with iOS 10 jailbreak tool, which never reached the public. There are no updates as well from TaiG and other hacking groups. iOS 10.3.1 Jailbreak Promised By A Security Researcher But It Might Take A While https://t.co/Hi3dn0A7qk pic.twitter.com/XwOXQiF7mW — Redmond Pie (@RedmondPie) May 19, 2017 Nonetheless, the jailbreak community still gives the hacking teams the benefit of the doubt. Since the 10.3.3 has only been seeded, the teams need some time to tweak whatever tool they have. So some recommend that the JB enthusiasts wait for a little while and not upgrade to the latest iOS version, also considering that after the iOS 10 firmware, Apple will be focusing on iOS 11. Furthermore, there are speculations that Pangu may have already been working with Apple, under the tech giant’s bounty program, according to 1redDrop. By advertising that a JB tool for 10.3.1 version will be released, users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest OS, giving up their iOS 10.2 or 9 jailbreaks. If the users do not save their blobs, there’s no way they can downgrade as Apple immediately stops supporting older versions of its OS once it rolls out the latest ones. iOS 11 Features: Sneak-Peek into Brand New Features https://t.co/PGdoLCZNyL pic.twitter.com/40j6Hqnxwt — ios dev (@dev_iosdev) May 18, 2017 iOS 10.3.3 is already available for download for developers. It would likely include additional bug fixes and security improvements. Although it could be expected to reach 10.4 or 10.5, no new features are foreseen to be introduced. After all, Apple is already gearing up for the iOS 11, which is expected to be announced in September, along with new iPhone devices.

By: PTI | Bengaluru | Published: May 19, 2017 7:39 PM “The high-end India-made iPhones (iPhone SE) have already hit the Indian market. These have been on sale from May 2 onwards,” another source said.(Representative image Reuters) The US-based technology major Apple has started selling iPhones at select stores in the country that were assembled in India as part of its trial run. “Apple is selling iPhone SE in India at select stores. These phones were assembled in India on trial basis in limited quantities,” an industry source told PTI. Apple did not comment on the development. The technology major a couple of days back had said that it was “beginning initial production of a small number of iPhone SE in Bengaluru”. “The high-end India-made iPhones (iPhone SE) have already hit the Indian market. These have been on sale from May 2 onwards,” another source said. You may also like to watch: A picture shared by the source showed details of the iPhone SE with 32GB storage capacity with ‘Designed by Apple in California, Assembled in India’ printed on the box. The picture showed the price of Rs 27,200 inclusive of all taxes on the box. The source also said the Cupertino-based maker of iPhones and iPads had completed the manufacturing of iPhones SEs in Bengaluru in April. The units are assembled by Apple’s Taiwanese manufacturing partner Wistron Corp. Earlier, Karnataka IT Minister Priyank Kharge had told PTI that the making of iPhones in India would help Apple lower prices and gain a foothold in the Indian market. He had also expressed hope that it would bring in much needed taxes to the state as well. Apple wants to bring its component manufacturers to India to make parts and export finished phones and is seeking tax concessions on import of key components. However, the central government has rejected most of the demands of the US company. Kharge also had said if the Centre was keen on taking on China, it should not give special treatment to Apple alone, but to other players like Samsung and Lenovo also if they are desirous of opening manufacturing units in India. Kharge had said the government should also give companies, including Apple, certain timelines, subsidies and incentives to create a level-playing field. No Comments.

The act would require digital product makers to release repair guides. Consumers who currently repair devices themselves face voiding warranties. Todd Haselton | @robotodd 17 Hours AgoCNBC.com SHARES Getty Images Tim Cook, CEO of Apple Inc. Apple is one of a number of companies lobbying to kill a new New York bill that would force companies to release information that would make it easier for customers and third-party shops to repair consumer goods. The lobbying efforts were first uncovered by Motherboard. Other companies involved in the effort to thwart the proposed "Fair Repair Act" include Johnson & Johnson Controls, the Consumer Technology Association, Lexmark, Toyota, Verizon and others. The bill seeks to "amend the general business law, in relation to the sale of digital electronic equipment diagnostic and repair information," and specifically calls on manufacturers "who operate and sell in New York State to make available diagnostic and repair information for digital electronic parts and machines." It would allow third parties, and even consumers, to easily access the information required to repair devices on their own, instead of having to pay the original manufacturer for a repair. Apple has a reason to try to do so. The company sells its AppleCare+ insurance to customers, who can then visit an Apple Store to have a device repaired by professional staff. If you crack your iPhone screen and have it repaired elsewhere — perhaps because it's cheaper to do so — you risk voiding your warranty if damage is done to other components during the process. There's a reason why Apple and other companies are opposed to third-party repair, however. Third-party companies may not replace parts with those of the same quality offered by the manufacturer. A shop on the corner in New York City, for example, may use a very cheap replacement screen to fix a cracked iPhone, instead of one of Apple's more premium screens. By keeping repairs in-house and under warranty, Apple and other companies can guarantee a level of quality assurance. Motherboard said that the Digital Right to Repair Coalition is fighting on behalf of the bill and has spent $5,042 lobbying in its favor, while a conglomerate of firms has lobbied against it, spending $366,634 to date. Apple alone is paying a $9,000 a month retainer for a lobbying firm named Roffe Group, Motherboard said. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

This is a wide-ranging, lively, sobering talk about the implications of tech feudalism and what we can do about it. By Maciej Cegłowski,  a painter and computer guy who lives  in San Francisco and runs a bookmarking site called Pinboard. Originally published at Idle Words This is the text version of a talk I gave on May 10, 2017, at the re:publica conference in Berlin. The good part about naming a talk in 2017 ‘Notes from an Emergency’ is that there are so many directions to take it. The emergency I want to talk about is the rise of a vigorous ethnic nationalism in Europe and America. This nationalism makes skillful use of online tools, tools that we believed inherently promoted freedom, to advance an authoritarian agenda. Depending on where you live, the rise of this new right wing might be nothing new. In the United States, our moment of shock came last November, with the election of Donald Trump. The final outcome of that election was: 65.8 million for Clinton 63.0 million for Trump This was the second time in sixteen years that the candidate with fewer votes won the American Presidency. There is a bug in the operating system of our democracy, one of the many ways that slavery still casts its shadow over American politics. But however tenuously elected, Trump is in the White House, and our crisis has become your crisis. Not just because America is a superpower, or because the forces that brought Trump to power are gaining ground in Europe, but because the Internet is an American Internet. Facebook is the dominant social network in Europe, with 349 million monthly active users. Google has something like 94% of market share for search in Germany. The servers of Europe are littered with the bodies of dead and dying social media sites. The few holdouts that still exist, like Xing, are being crushed by their American rivals. In their online life, Europeans have become completely dependent on companies headquartered in the United States. And so Trump is in charge in America, and America has all your data. This leaves you in a very exposed position. US residents enjoy some measure of legal protection against the American government. Even if you think our intelligence agencies are evil, they’re a lawful evil. They have to follow laws and procedures, and the people in those agencies take them seriously. But there are no such protections for non-Americans outside the United States. The NSA would have to go to court to spy on me; they can spy on you anytime they feel like it. This is an astonishing state of affairs. I can’t imagine a world where Europe would let itself become reliant on American cheese, or where Germans could only drink Coors Light. In the past, Europe has shown that it’s capable of identifying a vital interest and moving to protect it. When American aerospace companies were on the point of driving foreign rivals out of business, European governments formed the Airbus consortium, which now successfully competes with Boeing. A giant part of the EU budget goes to subsidize farming, not because farming is the best use of resources in a first-world economy, but because farms are important to national security, to the landscape, to national identity, social stability, and a shared sense of who we are. But when it comes to the Internet, Europe doesn’t put up a fight. It has ceded the ground entirely to American corporations. And now those corporations have to deal with Trump. How hard do you think they’ll work to defend European interests? The Feudal Internet The status quo in May 2017 looks like this: There are five Internet companies—Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook. Together they have a market capitalization just under 3 trillion dollars. Bruce Schneier has called this arrangement the feudal Internet. Part of this concentration is due to network effects, but a lot of it is driven by the problem of security. If you want to work online with any measure of convenience and safety, you must choose a feudal lord who is big enough to protect you. These five companies compete and coexist in complex ways. Apple and Google have a duopoly in smartphone operating systems. Android has 82% of the handset market, iOS has 18%. Google and Facebook are on their way to a duopoly in online advertising. Over half of the revenue in that lucrative ($70B+) industry goes to them, and the two companies between them are capturing all of the growth (16% a year). Apple and Microsoft have a duopoly in desktop operating systems. The balance is something like nine to one in favor of Windows, not counting the three or four people who use Linux on the desktop, all of whom are probably at this conference. Three companies, Amazon, Microsoft and Google, dominate cloud computing. AWS has 57% adoption, Azure has 34%. Google has 15%. Outside of China and Russia, Facebook and LinkedIn are the only social networks at scale. LinkedIn has been able to survive by selling itself to Microsoft. And outside of Russia and China, Google is the world’s search engine. That is the state of the feudal Internet, leaving aside the court jester, Twitter, who plays an important but ancillary role as a kind of worldwide chat room. Google in particular has come close to realizing our nightmare scenario from 1998, a vertically integrated Internet controlled by a single monopoly player. Google runs its own physical network, builds phone handsets, develops a laptop and phone operating system, makes the world’s most widely-used browser, runs a private DNS system, PKI certificate authority, has photographed nearly all the public spaces in the world, and stores much of the world’s email. But because it is run by more sympathetic founders than Bill Gates, because it builds better software than early Microsoft did, and because it built up a lot of social capital during its early “don’t be evil” period, we’ve given it a pass. Security It’s not clear that anyone can secure large data collections over time. The asymmetry between offense and defense may be too great. If defense at scale is possible, the only way to do it is by pouring millions of dollars into hiring the best people to defend it. Data breaches at the highest levels have shown us that the threats are real and ongoing. And for every breach we know about, there are many silent ones that we won’t learn about for years. A successful defense, however, just increases the risk. Pile up enough treasure behind the castle walls and you’ll eventually attract someone who can climb them. The feudal system makes the Internet more brittle, ensuring that when a breach finally comes, it will be disastrous. Each of the big five companies, with the important exception of Apple, has made aggressive user surveillance central to its business model. This is a dilemma of the feudal internet. We seek protection from these companies because they can offer us security. But their business model is to make us more vulnerable, by getting us to surrender more of the details of our lives to their servers, and to put more faith in the algorithms they train on our observed behavior. These algorithms work well, and despite attempts to convince us otherwise, it’s clear they work just as well in politics as in commerce. So in our eagerness to find safety online, we’ve given this feudal Internet the power to change our offline world in unanticipated and scary ways. Globalism These big five companies operate on a global scale, and partly because they created the industries they now dominate, they enjoy a very lax regulatory regime. Everywhere outside the United States and EU, they are immune to government oversight, and within the United Statesl the last two administrations have played them with a light touch. The only meaningful attempt to regulate surveillance capitalism has come out of the European Union. Thanks to their size and reach, the companies have become adept at stonewalling governments and evading attempts at regulation or oversight. In many cases, this evasion is noble. You don’t want Bahrain or Poland to be able to subpoena Facebook and get the names of people organizing a protest rally. In other cases, it’s purely self-serving. Uber has made a sport of evading all authority, foreign and domestic, in order to grow. Good or bad, the lesson these companies have drawn is the same: they need only be accountable to themselves. But their software and algorithms affect the lives of billions of people. Decisions about how this software works are not under any kind of democratic control. In the best case, they are being made by idealistic young people in California with imperfect knowledge of life in a faraway place like Germany. In the worst case, they are simply being read out of a black-box algorithm trained on God knows what data. This is a very colonial mentality! In fact, it’s what we fought our American War of Independence over, a sense of grievance that decisions that affected us were being made by strangers across the ocean. Today we’re returning the favor to all of Europe. Facebook, for example, has only one manager in Germany to deal with every publisher in the country. One! The company that is dismantling the news industry in Germany doesn’t even care enough to send a proper team to manage the demolition. Denmark has gone so far as to appoint an ambassador to the giant tech companies, an unsettling but pragmatic acknowledgement of the power relationship that exists between the countries of Europe and Silicon Valley. So one question (speaking now as an EU citizen): how did we let this happen? We used to matter! We used to be the ones doing the colonizing! We used to be a contender! How is it that some dopey kid in Palo Alto gets to decide the political future of the European Union based on what they learned at big data boot camp? Did we lose a war? The lack of accountability isn’t just troubling from a philosophical perspective. It’s dangerous in a political climate where people are pushing back at the very idea of globalization. There’s no industry more globalized than tech, and no industry more vulnerable to a potential backlash. China and Russia show us that the Internet need not be a world-wide web, that it can be subverted and appropriated by the state. By creating a political toolkit for authoritarian movements, the American tech giants may be putting their own future at risk. Irreality Given this scary state of the world, with ecological collapse just over the horizon, and a population sharpening its pitchforks, an important question is how this globalized, unaccountable tech industry sees its goals. What does it want? What will all the profits be invested in? What is the plan? The honest answer is: rocket ships and immortality. I wish I was kidding. The best minds in Silicon Valley are preoccupied with a science fiction future they consider it their manifest destiny to build. Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk are racing each other to Mars. Musk gets most of the press, but Bezos now sells $1B in Amazon stock a year to fund Blue Origin. Investors have put over $8 billion into space companies over the past five years, as part of a push to export our problems here on Earth into the rest of the Solar System. As happy as I am to see Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos fired into space, this does not seem to be worth the collapse of representative government. Our cohort of tech founders is feeling the chill breath of mortality as they drift into middle age. And so part of what is driving this push into space is a more general preoccupation with ‘existential risk’. Musk is persuaded that we’re living in a simulation, and he or a fellow true believer has hired programmers to try to hack it. Peter Thiel, our most unfortunate German import, has built a survival retreat for himself in New Zealand. Sam Altman hoards gold in Big Sur. OpenAI, a religious cult thinly disguised as a research institution, has received $1B in funding to forestall the robot rebellion. The biggest existential risk, of course, is death, so a lot of money is going to make sure that our big idea men don’t expire before the world has been received the full measure of their genius. Google Ventures founded the very secretive life extension startup Calico, with $1.5B dollars in funding. Google loses $4B a year on its various “moon shots”, which include life extension. They employ Ray Kurzweil, who believes we’re still on track for immortality by 2045. Larry Ellison has put $370M to anti-aging research, as anybody would want to live in a world with an immortal Larry Ellison. Our plutocrats are eager to make death an opt-out experience. Now, I’m no fan of death. I don’t like the time commitment, or the permanence. A number of people I love are dead and it has strained our relationship. But at the same time, I’m not convinced that a civilization that is struggling to cure male-pattern baldness is ready to take on the Grim Reaper. If we’re going to worry about existential risk, I would rather we start by addressing the two existential risks that are indisputably real—nuclear war and global climate change—and working our way up from there. But real problems are messy. Tech culture prefers to solve harder, more abstract problems that haven’t been sullied by contact with reality. So they worry about how to give Mars an earth-like climate, rather than how to give Earth an earth-like climate. They debate how to make a morally benevolent God-like AI, rather than figuring out how to put ethical guard rails around the more pedestrian AI they are introducing into every area of people’s lives. The tech industry enjoys tearing down flawed institutions, but refuses to put work into mending them. Their runaway apparatus of surveillance and manipulation earns them a fortune while damaging everything it touches. And all they can think about is the cool toys they’ll get to spend the profits on. The message that’s not getting through to Silicon Valley is one that your mother taught you when you were two: you don’t get to play with the new toys until you clean up the mess you made. The circumstances that have given the tech industry all this power will not last long. There is a limited time in which our small caste of tech nerds will have the power to make decisions that shape the world. By wasting the talents and the energies of our brightest people on fantasy role play, we are ceding the future to a more practical group of successors, some truly scary people who will take our tools and use them to advance a very different agenda. To recap: the Internet has centralized into a very few hands. We have an extremely lucrative apparatus of social control, and it’s being run by chuckleheads. The American government is also being run by chuckleheads. The question everybody worries about is, what happens when these two groups of chuckleheads join forces? The Winter For many Americans, the election was a moment of profound shock. It wasn’t just Trump’s policies that scared us. It was the fact that this unserious, cruel, vacant human being had been handed the power of the American presidency. Scariest to me was how little changed. No one in the press or in social media had the courage to say “we fucked up.” Pundits who were stunned by the election result still made confident predictions about what would happen next, as if they had any claim to predictive power. After the election both Facebook and Google looked at the mountains of data they had collected on everyone, looked at the threats the Trump Administration was making—to deport 11 million people, to ban Muslims from entering the country—and said to themselves, “we got this.” The people who did worry were tech workers. For a moment, we saw some political daylight appear between the hundreds of thousands of people who work in the tech sector, and the small clique of billionaires who run it. While the latter filed in to a famously awkward meeting with Trump and his children at the top of his golden tower, the former began organizing in opposition, including signing a simple but powerful pledge to resign rather than help Trump fulfill one of his key campaign promises: barring Muslims from the United States. This pledge was a small gesture, but it represented the first collective action by tech workers around a political agenda that went beyond technology policy, and the first time I had ever seen tech workers come out in open defiance of management. A forest of new organizations sprung up. I started one, too, called Tech Solidarity, and started traveling around the country and holding meetings with tech workers in big cities. I had no idea what I was doing, other than trying to use a small window of time to organize and mobilize our sleepy industry. That feeling of momentum continued through when Trump took office. The Women’s Marchin January brought five million people out onto the streets. America is not used to mass protests. To see the streets of our major cities fill with families, immigrants, in many cases moms and daughters and grandmothers marching together, that was a sight to take your breath away. Hard on the heels of it came the travel ban, an executive order astonishing not just in its cruelty—families were split at airports; in one case a mom was not allowed to breastfeed her baby—but in its ineptitude. For a week or two lawyers were camped out at airports, working frantically, sleeping little, with spontaneous efforts to bring them supplies, get them funding, to do anything to help. We held a rally in San Francisco that raised thirty thousand dollars from a room of a hundred people. Some of the organizations we were helping couldn’t even attend, they were too busy at the airport. It didn’t matter. The tech companies did all they could to not get involved. Facebook has a special ‘safety check‘ feature for exactly this kind of situation, but never thought of turning it on at airports. Public statements out of Silicon Valley were so insipid as to be comical. Employees, however, were electrified. It looked like not only visitors but permanent residents would be barred from the United States. Google employees staged a walkoutwith the support of their management; Facebook (not wishing to be left behind) had its own internal protest a couple of days later, but kept it a secret. Every time the employees pushed, management relented. Suddenly top executives were going on the record against the travel ban. People briefly even got mad at Elon Musk, normally a darling of the tech industry, for his failure to resign from the President’s advisory council. The silent majority of tech employees had begun to mobilize. And then… nothing happened. This tech workforce, which had gotten a taste of its own power, whose smallest efforts at collective action had produced immediate results, who had seen just how much sway they held, went back to work. The worst of Trump’s travel ban was blocked by the court, and we moved on. With the initial shock of Trump in office gone, we now move from crisis to crisis, but without a plan or a shared positive goal. The American discomfort with prolonged, open disagreement has set in. When I started trying to organize people in November, my theory was that tech workers were the only group that had leverage over the tech giants. My reasoning went like this: being monopolies or near-monopolies, these companies are impervious to public pressure. Boycotts won’t work, since opting out of a site like Google means opting out of much of modern life. Several of these companies are structured (unusually for American corporations) in such a way that the board can’t control the majority of votes. At Google and Facebook, for example, the ultimate say goes to the founders. And since Google and Facebook are the major online publishing outlets, it’s unlikely that the press would ever criticize them, even if journalists were capable of that kind of sustained attention. So that leaves just one point of leverage: employees. Tech workers are hard to find, expensive to hire, take a long time to train, and can have their pick of jobs. Tech companies are small compared to other industries, relying heavily on automation. If even a few dozen workers on an ops team acted in concert, they would have the power to shut down a tech giant like Google. All they had to do was organize around a shared agenda. Workers seemed receptive to the argument, but confused about how they could make collective action a reality. Trade unions in the United States have been under attack for decades. There is almost no union culture in technology. Our tech workers are passive and fatalistic. So here I am in Europe, wondering, what on Earth can we do? And I keep coming back to this idea of connecting the tech industry to reality. Bringing its benefits to more people, and bringing the power to make decisions to more people. Closing the Loop After Communism collapsed in Poland, I started visiting the country every eight months or so. Even in the darkest period of the 1990’s, it was striking to see people’s material standard of living improve. Suddenly people had cars, phones, appliances. These gains were uneven but broad. Even farmers and retirees, though they were the hardest hit, had access to consumer goods that weren’t available before. You could see the change in homes and in public spaces. It was no longer necessary for office workers in Kraków to change their shirts at lunchtime because of soot in the air. The tap water in Warsaw went from light brown to a pleasant pale yellow. For all the looting, corruption, and inefficiency of privatization, enough of the new wealth got through that the overall standard of living went up. Living standards in Poland in 2010 had more than doubled from 1990. In the same time period, in the United States, I’ve seen a whole lot of nothing. Despite fabulous technical progress, practically all of it pioneered in our country, there’s been a singular failure to connect our fabulous prosperity with the average person. A study just out shows that for the median male worker in the United States, the highest lifetime wages came if you entered the workforce in 1967. That is astonishing. People born in 1942 had better lifetime earnings prospects than people entering the workforce today. You can see this failure to connect with your own eyes even in a rich place like Silicon Valley. There are homeless encampments across the street from Facebook headquarters. California has a larger GDP than France, and at the same time has the highest poverty rate in America, adjusted for cost of living. Not only did the tech sector fail to build up the communities around it, but it’s left people worse off than before, by pricing them out of the places they grew up. Walk the length of Market Street (watch your step!) in San Francisco and count the shuttered store fronts. Take Caltrain down to San Jose, and see if you can believe that it is the richest city in the United States, per capita. The massive increase in wealth has not connected with a meaningful way with average people’s lives even in the heart of tech country, let alone in the forgotten corners of the country. The people who run Silicon Valley identify with progressive values. They’re not bad people. They worry about these problems just like we do; they want to help. So why the failure to do anything? Like T.S. Eliot wrote: Between the idea And the reality Between the motion And the act Falls the Shadow As I said earlier, the tech industry hates messy problems. We’d rather dream up new problems we can solve from scratch. One reason nothing happens is a culture of tax evasion. There’s a folk belief in American business that if you pay full taxes, you’re not doing your fiduciary duty, and your board will fire you. Apple now has a quarter trillion dollars offshore that it refuses to put into direct productive use in the United States. Apple boasts that its products are designed in California—they will sell you a $300 book called Designed By Apple In California. But they do their damndest to make sure that California never sees a penny of their overseas profits. You in the EU are all too familiar with this brand of tax evasion. Google, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft have all been under investigation or in court on charges of evading European taxes. Another reason good intentions don’t translate is that capitalism, especially venture capital, doesn’t work very well when there is vast wealth inequality. The richest 20 people in tech control a fortune of half a trillion dollars in personal wealth, more than the GDP of Sweden. This small subculture of wealthy technophiles promotes investment into luxury goods for rich people, or into “mom as a service” types of companies that cater to spoiled workaholics in the tech industry. And so we end up with things like a $120M juice squeezer, or three startups competing to deliver organic baby food. Silicon Valley brings us the worst of two economic systems: the inefficiency of a command economy coupled with the remorselessness of laissez-faire liberalism. One reason it’s been difficult to organize workers in the tech industry is that people have a hard time separating good intentions from results. But we have to be cold-blooded about this. Tech companies are run by a feckless leadership accountable to no one, creating a toolkit for authoritarianism while hypnotized by science-fiction fantasy. There are two things we have to do immediately. The first is to stop the accelerating process of tracking and surveillance before it can do any more harm to our institutions. The danger facing us is not Orwell, but Huxley. The combo of data collection and machine learning is too good at catering to human nature, seducing us and appealing to our worst instincts. We have to put controls on it. The algorithms are amoral; to make them behave morally will require active intervention. The second thing we need is accountability. I don’t mean that I want Mark Zuckerberg’s head on a pike, though I certainly wouldn’t throw it out of my hotel room if I found it there. I mean some mechanism for people whose lives are being brought online to have a say in that process, and an honest debate about its tradeoffs. I’m here today because I believe the best chance to do this is in Europe. The American government is not functional right now, and the process of regulatory capture is too far gone to expect any regulations limiting the tech giants from either party. American tech workers have the power to change things, but not the desire. Only Europe has the clout and the independence to regulate these companies. You can already point to regulatory successes, like forcing Facebook to implement hard delete on user accounts. That feature was added with a lot of grumbling, but because of the way Facebook organizes its data, they had to make it work the same for all users. So a European regulation led to a victory for privacy worldwide. We can do this again. Here are some specific regulations I would like to see the EU impose: A strict 30 day time limit on storing behavioral data. The right to opt out of data collection while continuing to use services. A ban on the sale or transfer of behavioral data, including to third-party ad networks. A requirement that advertising be targeted strictly to content, not users. With these rules in place, we would still have Google and Facebook, and they would still make a little bit of money. But we would gain some breathing room. These reforms would knock the legs out from underground political ad campaigns like we saw in Brexit, and in voter suppression efforts in the US election. They would give publishers relief in an advertising market that is currently siphoning all their earnings to Facebook and Google. And they would remove some of the incentive for consumer surveillance. The other thing I hope to see in Europe is a unionized workforce at every major tech company. Unionized workers could demand features like ephemeral group messaging at Facebook, a travel mode for social media, a truly secure Android phone, or the re-imposition of the wall between Gmail and DoubleClick data. They could demand human oversight over machine learning algorithms. They could demand non-cooperation with Trump. And I will say selfishly, if you can unionize here, it will help us unionize over there. If nothing else, we need your help and we need you to keep the pressure on the tech companies, the Trump Administration, and your own politicians and journalists, so that the disaster that happened in the United States doesn’t repeat itself in Germany. You have elections coming soon. Please learn from what happened to us. Please stay safe. And please regulate, regulate, regulate this industry, while you can. Thank you. 005902 This entry was posted in Globalization, Guest Post, Income disparity, Politics, Technology and innovation on May 19, 2017 by Yves Smith.

What popped on first reading is the description of the rise of income in Poland and the stagnation of income in the U S of A. What pops for me on seccond reading is these paragraphs about tax evasion and income inequality: >> One reason nothing happens is a culture of tax evasion. There’s a folk belief in American business that if you pay full taxes, you’re not doing your fiduciary duty, and your board will fire you. Apple now has a quarter trillion dollars offshore that it refuses to put into direct productive use in the United States. Apple boasts that its products are designed in California—they will sell you a $300 book called Designed By Apple In California. But they do their damndest to make sure that California never sees a penny of their overseas profits. You in the EU are all too familiar with this brand of tax evasion. Google, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft have all been under investigation or in court on charges of evading European taxes. Another reason good intentions don’t translate is that capitalism, especially venture capital, doesn’t work very well when there is vast wealth inequality. [Tax evasion isn’t just a folk belief: It is taught in U.S. law schools and in business schools, along with union busting.] Reply ↓ Jef May 19, 2017 at 10:52 am What the author inadvertently points out is that capitalism, particularly the so called consumer capitalism that we have is like a board game; It has a begining when anything is possible. A middle when a broad spectrum of players prosper and there is extra money for infrastructure and public amenities. Then an end where wealth is increasingly concentrated in fewer and fewer hands and the waste stream has taken its toll. Reply ↓ diptherio May 19, 2017 at 11:49 am Another reason good intentions don’t translate is that capitalism, especially venture capital, doesn’t work very well when there is vast wealth inequality. The author does not understand that capitalism creates vast wealth inequality: that’s the whole point. Inequality is a feature, not a bug, and so trying to save capitalism while eliminating vast wealth inequalities is working at cross-purposes, and only one of those aims can be successful…and guess which one it always is? Reply ↓ justanotherprogressive May 19, 2017 at 11:56 am +100 Reply ↓ Wisdom Seeker May 19, 2017 at 12:39 pm “capitalism creates vast wealth inequality: that’s the whole point.” Not in Adam Smith’s world, nor Henry Ford’s. True capitalists prosper by creating wealth which improves the lives of everyone around them. Crony capitalists, the ones we have now, strip wealth from others. Witness today’s bubble-and-bust cycles rather than the prior widespread economic growth. The capitalism you see today is an abomination of the original concept, just as Mnuchin’s claim to support “Glass Steagall” is an abomination. And don’t get me started on the “Affordable” Care Act, or the “Patriot” act which gutted the Constitution… P.S. The original author’s article is riddled with glaring factual errors, but he has the big picture right: it’s time to restore Antitrust Law and apply it to the internet monopolists. And restore privacy rights… and… and… it’s a long list. Start fighting now, if you want anything to happen in your lifetime! Reply ↓ Carla May 19, 2017 at 2:05 pm The author’s central thesis strikes me as correct: that Europe provides the only hope for applying any brakes whatsoever to the American tech sector. I hope someone over there is listening, as prospects here seem utterly hopeless. Reply ↓ MyLessThanPrimeBeef May 19, 2017 at 2:21 pm Freedom means people should have reasonable alternatives, choices on any product, service or ideology. Today’s internet experience lacks that freedom aspect quite a bit. Reply ↓ diptherio May 19, 2017 at 2:42 pm Hokum. The “theory” is that it benefits everyone, but the reality is quite different. Tell me, when where these good old days, of “true” capitalism? Back when we were enslaving Africans? Back when we were hanging Wobblies? Back when we had to put nets around our factories to keep the workers from committing suicide? Please…the dictatorship of the proletariat worked out just fine in Marx’s theory, too. Reply ↓ clinical wasteman May 19, 2017 at 3:00 pm Another one for the gallery of glaring factual errors: “capitalists prosper by creating wealth”. Unless that was an epic typo for something like: “workers fail to prosper while creating wealth”. As for “the original concept” of “capitalism”, in which district of the astral plane did you find that? Apart from his anthropological sci-fi about the origins of money in “barter”, Adam Smith generally tried to write about the real world. Just like Marx, except that Smith was speaking for a different class interest, whose “moral philosopher” imagined himself to be. For that reason, “capital” and “capitalist”(n.) were important concepts for Smith and Marx alike, but “capitalism” — a sort of hybrid implying the social reality and the ideology cheerleading for it at once without ever really distinguishing between the two — is an abstraction that neither had much time for, and one that only really caught on once both were dead. Reply ↓ Wisdom Seeker May 19, 2017 at 4:01 pm Wasteman – for a start, unlike todays Cronyists, Adam Smith understood that capitalism would not function for the benefit of all unless monopolies were restrained by government: “The interest of the dealers [referring to stock owners, manufacturers, and merchants], however, in any particular branch of trade or manufacture, is always in some respects different from, and even opposite to, that of the public. To widen the market and to narrow the competition, is always the interest of the dealers. To widen the market may frequently be agreeable enough to the interest of the public; but to narrow the competition must always be against it, and can serve only to enable the dealers, by raising their profits above what they naturally would be, to levy, for their own benefit, and absurd tax upon the rest of their fellow-citizens. (Adam Smith, Wealth of Nations (Amherst, New York: Prometheus Books, 1991), pages 219-220)” See here for more details: https://machineryofpolitics.wordpress.com/2012/01/04/adam-smith-on-the-crisis-of-capitalism-2/ Another interesting perspective is from J. K. Galbraith (sorry I lost the source) who pointed out that in an economy with healthy competition, profit margins are lower, but employment and wage income are necessarily higher. Reply ↓ diptherio May 19, 2017 at 5:14 pm And pray tell, who is it who will restrain the monopolists? Our elected officials, who just so happen to be under the control of those same capitalists? Which is possible due to the vast wealth inequalities that capitalism generates…. Capitalists, almost without exception, do everything in their power to avoid competition. The idea is to make a profit and competition is antithetical to that. Lots of things are good in theory, like three-way relationships. Reality, on the other hand, feels no obligation to correspond with theory. Reply ↓ sierra7 May 19, 2017 at 9:24 pm Eventually the “sharpened pitchforks”…..the guillotine worked well during the French Revolution….we’re getting closer and closer! As far as the rest of the article you may as well as put a bag over you’re head if you pay attention to all the things that these giants of the internet (and our fed government) are doing daily. We all make choices; I choose to use the internet only for information, not banking or real personal transactions. I could give a hoot on what they gather as far as their algorithmic interpretations of my roaming the internet. I purchase extremely small and really insignificant items thru the internet. I choose not to participate wholly in contemporary life. I’m fortunate; been retired for more than 20 years; moved away from Silicon Valley and if I can help it only commune with the squirrels and other forms of nature. All the “giants” of capitalism have been eventually toppled; big steel; big coal; big rail; big anything….they all go down….eventually. And I won’t weep a tear if JBezos or others strap a rocket onto their asses an blast off into space….good riddance. Reply ↓ darthbobber May 20, 2017 at 12:15 am But the “non-monopolist” capitalism in the Victorian era had incredibly stark poverty and starvation throughout a very broad swathe of the working class, so much so that government intervention on hours and conditions of work came to be seen as a military necessity because so many young workers suffered sufficient malnutrition and disease to be unsuitable for cannon fodder. Indeed, the rise of the socialist movement took place during a much more competitive era of capitalism than we have today. Reply ↓ clinical wasteman May 20, 2017 at 1:17 am Didn’t mean to question Smith’s dislike of monopolists or the sincerity of his belief that he was writing moral philosophy throughout. In fact the earlier comment wasn’t intended polemically against him at all. His idea of “the public” is unlike mine in that it doesn’t seem to include the [90+?]% at the unlucky end of the division of labour, much less the unluckier indigenous inhabitants of “new territories” or the indentured (at best) workforce shipped out to replace them. But my point was more: 1. that Smith, Ricardo and Marx wrote about capital and capitalists, not about “capitalism” as such, and: 2. that it’s not true that capitalists — however benign and monopoly-averse they may mean to be — ever create wealth. Only labour can do that. Smith’s own articulation of a “labour theory of value” is in some ways more concise and easily explained to skeptics than Marx’s, but he also seems to have felt obliged to come up with a theory of the redeeming social utility of capitalists, because they and their immediate dependents constituted “the public” in his taxonomy of human sub-species. That doesn’t make him a fool or a bad guy, just a forthright spokesman for the “embattled” Scottish bourgeoisie of the 18th century. Most interestingly of all, there’s at least a case to be made that he theorized the “tendency of the rate of profit to fall” a century before Marx and maybe even “perpetual primitive accumulation” two centuries before Autonomist Marxists [http://www.midnightnotes.org/index2.html]. And this theory of crisis (‘Wealth of Nations’, book 1, ch. 8/9: The wages of labour/The profits of stock) was not about monopolies but about ever more futile competition for diminishing returns on “stationary” capital. The only remedy for which was for some bold East/West India Company-type Public-Private Partnership to claim “new territory”, which would be fabulously profitable for a while until everyone else caught on and the whole thing had to be started over again somewhere “newer”. As in the scramble for the Caribbean in the late 18th century, for Africa in the late 19th/1st half of the 20th, or Eastern Europe post-1989. Or, less “successfully”, the Darien Scheme [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darien_scheme] of the 1690s, but that would probably not have been one of Smith’s favourite case studies. Reply ↓ skippy May 20, 2017 at 2:24 am Ain’t that the rub – new territories – so when the physical no longer affords…. a new territory must be created… Reply ↓ Vatch May 19, 2017 at 3:27 pm capitalism creates vast wealth inequality Not exactly. Capitalism extends or expands existing inequality. It was the development of agriculture several thousand years ago that broke the approximate egalitarianism of the hunter gatherer lifestyle. Even that had some inequality, but not much. For more information, see the early chapters of The Great Leveler, by Walter Scheidel. Reply ↓ diptherio May 19, 2017 at 5:23 pm Hence the “vast” part. I’m not so silly as to think that before capitalism there was not wealth inequality. But not the type where a few hundred people control more wealth than a few billion. It would seem to me, on just a gut level based on a little reading, that whereas systems like feudalism were unequal but relatively stable*, i.e. the level of inequality stayed the same generation to generation, capitalism’s dynamics have caused inequality to skyrocket, both nationally and globally. *Or at least cyclically stable, as with regular debt jubilees in Sumer. Reply ↓ Vatch May 19, 2017 at 9:21 pm 2000 years ago wealth inequality was vast in the Roman empire and in the Chinese Han empire, both of which were pre-capitalistic. You’re correct that European feudalism was less extreme than modern capitalism. That’s one of the points of Scheidel’s book: state collapse sometimes leads to greater equality, and the collapse of the Roman empire is an example. Reply ↓ darthbobber May 20, 2017 at 12:17 am Yes. Inability to produce a surplus above subsistence in the first place does indeed obviate the problem of somebody appropriating more than their share of said surplus. Reply ↓ HBE May 19, 2017 at 3:11 pm “Living standards in Poland in 2010 had more than doubled from 1990.” This sentence annoyed me to no end. Yes, the reason that is true is because every capitalist country in the world worked to smash and destroy communism without pause for its entire life and then internal and external oligarchs snatched up everything. Living standards increased over that period in Poland but so did inequality and poverty. So the country got some shiny new consumer goods (which the author seems enamored by) while the populations poverty rate continues to climb. Thank god for privatization (“Suddenly people had cars, phones, appliances” and suddenly poverty surged as well), and the end of those no good dirty commies, right? Reply ↓ vlado May 19, 2017 at 4:02 pm Yeah, it’s really a pity that author of such a well-written piece confuses GDP with living standards. If that was the case people wouldn’t vote for nationalist and populists. In any case, despite very good performance of Polish economy, its convergence to West Europe at least in terms of GDP (PPP) is questionable as the cases of Czech Republic and Slovenia show. See the article The convergence dream 25 years on in Bruegel Reply ↓ visitor May 19, 2017 at 6:04 pm There is a reason why people voted for the populist PiS and ousted the liberals who had made such a great job at bringing Poland into the EU and its “market society”. Reply ↓ Yves Smith Post authorMay 19, 2017 at 11:17 pm It is neither helpful nor logically sound to engage in black and white thinking. And you have NO basis whatsoever to dispute the claim that living standards have increased in Poland when Cegłowski has seen it happen over his regular visits there. I have a friend who is Polish (undergrad degree there, grad degree from MIT) and she also says things have improved a great deal This is clearly the case for the former East Germany, Hungary, and Czech Republic. You discredit yourself with factually unfounded, knee-jerk reactions. Reply ↓ justanotherprogressive May 19, 2017 at 10:23 am A long but brilliant article that everyone should take the time to read! I want all the techies in my family to read it because it points out some of the uneasiness even techies feel about the their industry. My favorite paragraph (although there were many close seconds): “But real problems are messy. Tech culture prefers to solve harder, more abstract problems that haven’t been sullied by contact with reality. So they worry about how to give Mars an earth-like climate, rather than how to give Earth an earth-like climate. They debate how to make a morally benevolent God-like AI, rather than figuring out how to put ethical guard rails around the more pedestrian AI they are introducing into every area of people’s lives.” Yep……. Reply ↓ Dead Dog May 19, 2017 at 11:39 am yes, well worth it. Thank you Yves (again). Reply ↓ diptherio May 19, 2017 at 12:05 pm I found it an odd mix of straight-talk and naivete. The NSA can’t spy on Americans without a warrant? Go ahead, pull the other one. Talking about the “collapse of representative government” as if we’ve ever had one. All very cute, and very silly. His suggestions for putting the brakes on are good, but insufficient. My ideas as to how to go about, “connecting the tech industry to reality. Bringing its benefits to more people, and bringing the power to make decisions to more people,” is here: http://threadingthepearls.blogspot.com/2014/11/youre-doing-it-wrong-politics-as-if.html Imagine a political party with no national platform—a party where local rank-and-file members select candidates from among themselves, and dictate the policies those candidates will support. [2] Imagine a political party whose candidates are transparent; one that guarantees every member an equal voice in shaping the actual policy proposals—and the votes—of their representatives. Imagine a political party whose focus is on empowering the rank-and-file members, instead of the charismatic con-artists we call politicians. Imagine a political party that runs on direct democracy, from bottom to top: open, transparent and accountable…. we’ll need an app…maybe two The app already exists, actually, and it’s called Loomio. Podemos uses it, along with a lot of other people: https://www.loomio.org/ Reply ↓ MyLessThanPrimeBeef May 19, 2017 at 2:28 pm That popular vote comment is misleading as well. A previous example was given about a hypothetical House vote, where, in yes-districts, voters are split 51-49 yes (assuming that is so…lots of times, congress persons vote ‘their conscience’) and voters in no-districts are 90-10 for no. Yes votes win by one. In that case, the popular vote actually is for No. And that has nothing to do with slavery. It’s how the math works in a representative voting system. Reply ↓ PhilM May 19, 2017 at 3:32 pm Before responding to MLTPB, I’d like to voice my opinion that the OP article is thoughtful and reflects a decent level of awareness of the reality of the world, along with positive solutions that would be achievable in a polity that had the public good as its aim. As for MLTPB’s opinion on the vote, I beg to differ: it has everything to do with slavery. That’s how the numbers work in our system, which is imperial, not representative. It’s a bitch when instead of Augustus you get Caligula, but it doesn’t change the basic reality of how the system works, and has worked since Ike. In our imperial system, it does not matter to the people whether they vote, or how; it matters, occasionally, to the contestants’ position in the power structure, but nothing more than that. Here is the reality: the people in any office in our federal government—basically everyone who lives in or around Washington DC—have the same relationship to American people as they have to Russian, Chinese, or Indian people: that of serving their own interests; predation, if you will; animal husbandry, if you prefer. They will act so as to extract the maximum value consistent with not-killing-the-goose-that-lays-the-golden-eggs from every person, wherever they are located, whatever their religion, whatever their nationality, as long as they are powerless, which means everyone who is a private citizen, however rich, or a small business; everyone who is not a Forbes 500 corporation. The notion that the federal government is somehow tied to “Americans,” or even to the geographical entity now known as the USA, much less to the values expressed in the so-called “founding documents,” is a child’s bedtime story. It’s amusing that it took the election of Trump to bring this realization about; but really, that is why some of us actually voted for Trump: to rub the idiots’ noses in the reality of their political environment. (Not me, mind you; because I do not bother to vote: when I want something done, I write a check, like any experienced consumer of government services.) There is a cure, but it is not changing the election mechanism so the choice of president results from the popular vote totals in a population of 300 million. No, it means changing it so there are 1000 presidents and 100,000 representatives and 1000 supreme courts, and 1000 republics. Those are the numbers that would achieve representative government the way it was designed to function by people who knew. Alternatively, you could reduce federal taxation to 1/10th of its current level, and assign all other taxation to the township, with a population limit of 20,000. Now you would have something that is no longer imperial. But since most people since the dawn of history have lived under organizations that are imperial with perfect happiness, the appropriate course of action is not to struggle in futility for change, which would almost certainly do more harm than good, and result in an outcome that would just use up the world’s resources more swiftly in the chaos of consumption and war. The optimum course is to watch reruns of amusing sitcoms and eat good food; to gratify the animal pleasures and such pleasures of the mind as remain to aging bodies mistreated by pharmaceuticals; and to die as quickly and painlessly as the authorities permit. Reply ↓ MyLessThanPrimeBeef May 19, 2017 at 5:37 pm In our imperial system, it does not matter to the people whether they vote, or how; it matters, occasionally, to the contestants’ position in the power structure, but nothing more than that. In that case, the popular vote question is not a question anymore (with the current 1 president, instead of 1,000 setup), as you point out here: There is a cure, but it is not changing the election mechanism so the choice of president results from the popular vote totals in a population of 300 million. I have mentioned before that Rome had, at one time, 2 or 4 co-emperors. You suggest 1,000 presidents, as a solution. That’s nothing to do with slavery, except in the sense that we’re all serfs or slaves. It about making one’s voice heard within a smaller group, having someone representing you along with fewer constituents. The inherent problem of having representatives vote, versus direct voting, is still here, as in the example given above. The math scales up and down. Reply ↓ PhilM May 19, 2017 at 9:14 pm Thanks for your thoughtful response. I meant just what you did in terms of “slavery” in the sense that we all are slaves if we have no effective representation. It was a word in common use by the Founders before the revolution, who often described themselves as “slaves,” with staggering hypocrisy, considering how many of them actually held human beings as property. It was a hypocrisy frequently pointed out at the time. The math scales badly if representation is sufficiently distant to be theoretical, not actual. The math of the Founders, originally set at 1 year and 30,000 souls per “representative,” was intended so that the people voting in the house would give a true picture of the intent of their constituency. The idea was that no man would pay a tax he did not agree with. How many people could say that they would pay their taxes willingly today? And yet that was the standard of the time: pay only for those things that the majority agree is worth buying for the public good. Reply ↓ Thomas Williams May 19, 2017 at 11:04 am Nice piece: Two things to note – The Clintons, Bush & Obama presided over this mess and aided in it’s creation but the albatross of abuse is being hung on Trump. – He shares an enormous egotistical blind spot common to tech workers. He wants unionization and strength for tech workers but seems to advocate for a globalized work force. More than anything else, foreign workers are responsible for wage suppression in the US. Is he saying ‘Tech workers are special and should be pampered but others should work for $1.85 per day”? – The above points are not germaine to his central theme, which is important and well written. But it does raise questions about his values. Reply ↓ Knot Galt May 19, 2017 at 2:13 pm Agreed. Trump = Chucklehead and the shadow in T.S.

Now. Get as far away from it as you possibly can. You’ll be the better person for it. There was a time I felt ‘modern life’ was the place to be….Now the older me realizes ‘modern life’ is a sham, an illusion, and a trap. A very cleverly designed trap, and one in which the cattle to be slaughtered all believe they are choosing their own destiny even as they are herded inexorably closer to the slaughterhouse. Amusingly, although my younger naive and idealistic self had a significant part to play in the great tech revolutions and evolutions through the 90’s and early 2000’s (for which I will be eternally regretful and ashamed, given how the creations we labored on have been whored out by the pimps in the oligarchy and government) I was also incredibly lucky to have grown up on a farm…and learned how to use a hoe, a hand powered washing machine, how to gather eggs…and grow things. Real things, things that can feed people. But more importantly….how to grow things like spirit and independence that do not rely on any flow of electrons to come to glorious fruition. I also so much better understand what that prophet Edward Abbey was trying to warn us about all those decades ago…. “…Growth for the sake of growth is the ideology of the cancer cell…” Reply ↓ Tom May 19, 2017 at 11:27 am Indeed.

Reply ↓ justanotherprogressive May 19, 2017 at 11:55 am Is “opting out” really an option? Are we willing to opt out out of modern medicine too? Whether we like it or not, we aren’t opting out of using the internet, so we aren’t opting out of anything this author talked about……. Sooooo……..wouldn’t a better idea be to learn as much as we can about this technology and get involved in its decision making, so that we can control it and make it work for rather than against us? Reply ↓ Jacobite_In_Training May 19, 2017 at 12:13 pm I’ve had that debate before, people typically starting with the ‘well, you are posting using the Internet so you aren’t really opting out of anything’, but thats a simplistic approach, and the process of opting out is a matter of degrees – it is never a binary on/off. One can continue ‘opting out’ of aspects of society, and technology, to as extreme a position as you wish….even back to the stone age, should you choose. (sort of the ultimate boycott) Tradeoffs are inherent to the process, no argument there….just be aware that the experience of opting out is itself liberating. You realize all these shiny objects, and expensive things, and complicated processes that you have been raised to think of as critical necessities that cannot ever EVER be parted with….may not be so critical as you think. Sometimes the tradeoffs will be negative, more often – in my experience – (once you have solved the problems presented by improvising/adapting/overcoming) …you will find the ‘tradeoffs’ are a net positive. You are, of course, a creature with free will and free to do what you choose…. opt in, opt out….as you will. :) Reply ↓ Thuto May 19, 2017 at 12:59 pm Agreed, there are several gradations to this whole opting out thing. I for one am completely absent from any social media platform and feel no loss whatsoever because of this. It takes a committed group of independent thinkers to deconstruct and debunk this whole narrative that you’re either “all-in” with these internet platforms or you opt out and life passes you by as you’re consigned to an existence of irrelevance and ignorance about the world around you. Reply ↓ MoiAussie May 19, 2017 at 1:05 pm Perhaps it would be more accurate to say that you are very selective about the social media in which you participate. Reply ↓ Thuto May 19, 2017 at 1:50 pm If by social media we are talking facebook, instagram et al, then I have never participated in any of those. To be sure, this is not meant to sound like I take a dim view on those who do, the point is the narrative is typically framed, at least in my part of the world, as an all-in/opt-out binary in which participation in social media platforms is a prime determinant in who “remains relevant” and who doesn’t… Reply ↓ Vatch May 19, 2017 at 3:29 pm I don’t have a MyFace account.

If you are on the internet, then you have to have a carrier – Verizon, Comcast, etc. Do you think their data collection systems are different than what Google, Facebook, or any other social media does? Reply ↓ jrs May 19, 2017 at 1:54 pm and least they aren’t funding trips to mars? :) Reply ↓ jrs May 19, 2017 at 1:51 pm Yea I think the truly open minded probably try many of the internet platforms just to see what they are like and then delete their accounts (this does not need to entail posting one’s entire private life there needless to say). Not a lot of open mindedness out there really though, it’s all extremes: rigid abstinence from it all, or hopeless addiction to it. I mean I understand a priori rejection of the majority of what capitalism produces (except if it’s necessary to life then well), but it is a pretty uninformed position from which to criticize (as is being addicted to it really). Reply ↓ PKMKII May 19, 2017 at 2:46 pm Even if you opt out personally, you’re still going to be interacting with a lot of people, businesses, governments, etc., that are dependent on the Five Horsemen. Pay cash at the local business, but travel down the supply chain that brought the goods there and you’ll run into someone using cloud storage, social media, consumer surveillance data, etc. Reply ↓ Wisdom Seeker May 19, 2017 at 1:01 pm Regarding “get involved in its decision making” – Ordinary folks have really only two ways to do this. One is in their consumer choices. Avoid or boycott companies that abuse their customers – hit them in their wallets. The other is in their voting and political participation push privacy rights, antitrust enforcement, etc. higher on the political agenda. It’s entirely possible to be comfortably social without “social media”. Personally, I boycott Facebook, Twitter, and (as much as possible) Google and Ebay. Google is tough because they have infiltrated the schools with Google Classroom (which has value, but do we really want an internet advertising company to be gathering data on our children?). Microsoft is tough because of the Office monopoly, but just because I have to use it at work doesn’t mean I need to pay them any money anywhere else in my life… There are also ways to buy online without using Amazon. Reply ↓ lyman alpha blob May 19, 2017 at 1:58 pm There are other search engines, browsers, email services, etc. besides those operated by the giants. DuckDuckGo, protonmail, and the Opera browser (with free built-in VPN!) work well for me. The problem is, if these other services ever do get popular enough, the tech giants will either block them by getting their stooges appointed to Federal agencies and regulating them out of existence, or buy them. I’ve been running from ISP acquisitions for years, as the little guys get bought out I have to find an even littler one. Luckily I’ve found a local ISP, GWI, that I’ve used for years now. They actually came out against the new regulations that would allow them to gather and sell their customers’ data. Such anathema will probably wind up with their CEO publicly flayed for going against all that is good and holy according to the Five Horsemen. Reply ↓ Mel May 19, 2017 at 1:26 pm There are two sides to opting out. When net neutrality is gone, then capital and market concentration will transform the internet into what cable TV is now, and nobody will need it much. Contrariwise the big tech companies are taking over the implementation of major social functions: – if you can’t vote without the internet – if you can’t spend your money without the internet – if you can’t contact your friends without the internet – if you can’t get news without the internet — this has already happened — just look at us all here. – if you can’t join a political party without liking it on your Facebook page and following it on Twitter — there are rumors that the Federal Liberal Party in Canada is exploring this. As I said somewhere else, all this would amount to an uncontracted and unspecified public/private partnership (various ones, actually) and all entered into unexamined. Time to examine them while they’re still easy to change. Reply ↓ HotFlash May 19, 2017 at 5:58 pm there are rumors that the Federal Liberal Party in Canada is exploring this. Interesting.

Reply ↓ jrs May 19, 2017 at 1:45 pm To assume that workers in ANY Industry (including tech where we know the big players have rigged the labor market against tech workers) have more power than consumers seems pretty unrealistic to me. Of course consumer power is one dollar one vote and hardly democratic but at least consumers do have options and some power. The employee role is a powerless one in the U.S..

Or we could fight for a knowledge society, where we collectively access knowledge while protecting our identity and privacy. I vote for the latter. Google would plant a chip in every child if they could. Short of that, they have insinuated themselves in public schools, hoping that every kid in America will consummate their relationship with this giant after they graduate from k-12. See this NY Times article from last weekend: How Google Took Over the Classroom It’s hard to mitigate their reach. In a landmark student privacy law passed in California (with an even weaker version passed in my state of Oregon), they built in what I call a Google exemption clause. (8) Nothing in this section shall be construed to impose a duty upon: (a) A provider of an electronic store, gateway, marketplace or other means of purchasing or downloading software or applications to review or enforce compliance with this section by those applications or software; or (b) A provider of an interactive computer service to review or enforce compliance with this section by third-party content providers. As used in this paragraph, “interactive computer service” means any information service, system or access software provider that provides or enables computer access by multiple users to a computer server, including specifically a service or system that provides access to the Internet and such services or systems operated or offered by libraries or educational institutions. (9) This section does not apply to general audience Internet websites, general audience online services, general audience online applications or general audience mobile applications, even if login credentials created for an operator’s site, service or application may be used to access those general audience sites, services or applications.

When I am not accessing knowledge, I would still prefer to remain private. For example, what videos I access for entertainment should private. It’s not knowledge I access, just something to pass time. That those activities should b protected as well. Privacy-protected-society is probably a broader term than knowledge society.

Reply ↓ Huey Long May 19, 2017 at 12:00 pm This piece is absolutely fantastic! Not to nit pick, but I do disagree with the author about the following passage: Even if you think our intelligence agencies are evil, they’re a lawful evil. They have to follow laws and procedures, and the people in those agencies take them seriously. But there are no such protections for non-Americans outside the United States. The NSA would have to go to court to spy on me; they can spy on you anytime they feel like it. We know from the Church and Pike committees that this is patently false, and I highly doubt that this has changed much since then, especially in light of Iran-Contra and the made-up intel used to justify the Iraq invasion. I know I probably sound like a broken record as I often cite the Church and Pike reports in my NC comments, but they’re just so little known and so important that I feel compelled to do so. I encourage the entire commenteriat to at least skim some of these documents to get a better understanding of the kinds of sickening things perpetrated by the intel community in the past and then ask yourself if the veil of secrecy that surrounds them is to keep secrets from the enemy or to keep the American public from vomiting.

Reply ↓ JustAnObserver May 19, 2017 at 12:44 pm I had the same reaction to that passage, at least initially. However what I think the author might mean by this is that to have the means to combat this evil 2 things are necessary: o Laws and/or procedures that place limitations on the actions of these agencies – NSA, CIA, DHS etc. o and, much much more important, the means to ensure those laws/procedures are *enforced* as to both statute and intent. USians have at least the first part even if the second, enforcement, has rotted to the extent of being no more than a cruel joke. non-USian have neither. Note that the lack of enforcement thing extends far beyond the IC agencies into anti-trust, environmental regulation, Sarbanes-Oxley, etc. etc.. Even the ludicrous botch called Dodd-Frank could work marginally better if there was some attempt to actually enforce it. Reply ↓ Wisdom Seeker May 19, 2017 at 1:03 pm “Dodd-Frank could work marginally better if there was some attempt to actually enforce it.” Unenforceable and unenforced laws are a feature, not a bug, and demonstrate the corruption of the system.

That bit about tech workers defying management to protest Trump’s travel ban seems demonstrably untrue, as the companies want that human capital pipeline kept open, and they can simultaneously wrap themselves in muliti-cultural virtue as they defend their employment practices. Also, and I know people here will disagree or think it irrelevant, but the “They’re not bad people,” thing is wrong; I think people such as Thiel, Kalanick, Zuckerberg, Ellison, add-your-own-candidates, seem like pretty awful people doing a lot of awful things, whatever their brilliance, business acumen, and relentlessness. Finally, while as a union guy I was pleased to see the importance he gave it, the idea of tech workers unionizing in this country seems like social science fiction, whatever their European counterparts might hopefully do. Reply ↓ TheCatSaid May 19, 2017 at 3:18 pm I, too, stumbled / choked when I read those paragraphs. They are provably false in so many dimensions I hardly know where to begin. It made it hard to read past. I will try again because so many commenters are so positive. But the author’s credibility sinks when a piece starts with such blindness or misinformation or pandering. Reply ↓ PhilM May 19, 2017 at 3:41 pm On the one hand, it’s probably some pandering, because he knows he is being watched. We all throw that same bone once in a while. From Vergil, it is called “a sop to Cerberus.” On the other hand, he is correct, too: it is a “lawful evil” because it functions using tax money, which is money extorted by force with the sanction of law, rather than “chaotic evil,” which is money extorted by force or fraud without that sanction. So in that positive-law-philosophy way of thinking, he has a point, even if it’s a pandering point. Reply ↓ knowbuddhau May 19, 2017 at 12:16 pm >>>”They have to follow laws and procedures, and the people in those agencies take them seriously.” This caught my eye earlier. Had to come back to it. Especially after reading Mike Whitney’s latest http://www.counterpunch.org/2017/05/19/seth-rich-craig-murray-and-the-sinister-stewards-of-the-national-security-state/ . In it, he details how seriously Clapper, Brennan et al. take those “laws and procedures.” Taking a recent and relevant example, remember the ICA, the “Intelligence Community Assessment”? Whitney quotes a Fox news article detailing the many ways in which it’s production varied sharply from normal procedures. And of course there was all that “stove-piping” of “intel” that helped make the bogus case for the 2003 war of aggression against Iraq. I appreciate the author’s point: it would be harder to surveil a particular American than a European. I’m sure rank & file people by & large respect law and procedure. But don’t worry, if there’s a political will to get you, there’s a way. Ask Chelsea Manning. Whitney concludes by quoting an especially apt question posed by Michael Glennon in the May issue of Harper’s: “Who would trust the authors of past episodes of repression as a reliable safeguard against future repression?” People who think they’re immune to said repression, for one. Or who don’t know or believe it happened/is happening at all. IOW political elites and most Americans, that’s who. I think there’s a good chance the soft coup will work, and most Americans would even accept a President-General. So while I see the author’s point, I see it this way. They take laws and procedures seriously like I take traffic laws seriously. Only their solution is to corrupt law enforcement, not follow the law. “Stop throwing the Constitution in my face, it’s just a goddamned piece of paper!” — President George W. Bush Silicon Valley elites apparently think the same. Reply ↓ TheCatSaid May 19, 2017 at 3:25 pm Mike Whitney’s article you linked to was interesting. George Webb’s ongoing YouTube series is going further still, as he is uncovering numerous anomalies with Seth Rich’s death and the circumstances and “investigation”. It turns out that nothing in this story is what it seems (the “school play” scenario). Disturbingly, there are similarities and patterns that connect up with numerous other patterns discussed earlier in this 208-day (so far) odyssey, which started with looking at irregularities around oil pipelines and drugs shipments, and ended up including numerous additional criminal enterprises, all with direct links to high-up government staff and political staff from both major parties, with links among key participants going back over decades in some cases. To return to your observation–knowing what I know now–personal as well as second-hand, I don’t think it’s harder to surveil an american than a european. The compromises of law enforcement, justice and intelligence and rogue contractors have no international boundaries. The way the compromises are done vary depending on local methods, and the degree of public awareness may vary, but the actuality and ease–no different overall.

The PC brought freedom from the IT department, until networking enslaved us again. The freedom was temporary, we were originally supposed to be serfs of a timeshare system connected to a mainframe. France was ahead of the US in that, they had MiniTel. But like everything French … is was efficient but static. In Europe, like in the US, the PC initially liberated, and then with networking, enslaved. Arpanet was the predecessor of the Internet … it was a Cold War system of survivable networking, for some people. The invention of HTTP and the browser at CERN democratized the Arpanet. But it also greatly enabled State-sponsored snooping. We are now moving to cloud storage and Chrome-books which will restore the original vision of a timeshare system connected to a mainframe, but at a higher technical standard. What was envisioned in 1968 will be achieved, but later than planned, and in a round about way. We are not the polity we used to be. In 1968 this would have been viewed by the public with suspicion. But after 50 years later … the public will view this as progress. Reply ↓ Huey Long May 19, 2017 at 1:22 pm In 1968 this would have been viewed by the public with suspicion.

Also, re-standalone-ing millions of personal PC machines and figuring out how to record stuff onto discs, thumb drives or other memory storage devices. And then moving such devices around by human courier or land mail or carrier pigeon or other methods. And of course people could go back to writing and sending landletters by landmail.

Reply ↓ Thuto May 19, 2017 at 1:33 pm Excellent post, except for the bit, as some other readers have commented, about American intelligence agencies being law abiding. Europe, and much of the world, crumbled without resistance in the face of the tech juggernauts because of the PR fetishization of anything that came out of silicon valley. The laxity of lawmakers and regulators was partly because of their unwillingness to be seen as standing in the way of “progress”. A public drunk on the need to be in with the new, “disruptive” kids on the block who were “changing the world” would have teamed up with the disruptors to run rough shod over any oversight mechanisms proposed by regulators. Hence the silicon valley PR machine always prioritises the general public as the first targets of intellectual capture, because an intellectually captured public loath to give up the benefits and convenience of “progress and disruption” is a powerful weapon in the arsenal of tech giants in their global war against regulation. And the insidious nature of the damage of overreach by these tech giants isn’t just limited to online interactions anymore, but the real world is also now experiencing disruption in the true sense of the word with gig economy companies reshaping the dynamics of entire markets and squeezing the most vulnerable members of society to the periphery of said markets, if not pushing them out entirely. In my own city of cape town south africa, a housing crisis is brewing as locals are being squeezed out of the housing market because landlords profit more from airbnb listings than making their properties available for long term rentals. Asset prices are being pushed up as “investors” compete to snap up available inventory to list on airbnb. And city officials seem more interested in celebrating cape town’s status as “one of the top airbnb destinations” than actually protecting the interests of their own citizens. Intellectual capture, and the need to be “in with the cool disruptive kids” is infecting even public sector organizations with severe consequences for the public at large, but the public is blind to this as they’ve binged on the “disruption, changing the world” cool-aid… Reply ↓ Bill Smith May 19, 2017 at 4:15 pm “PR fetishization of anything that came out of silicon valley” It had nothing to do with individuals thinking this stuff had value?

It’s imperative to understand the that the system we find ourselves in is a belief system – an ideology – and the choices to be made in regards to challenging it. https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/11/accelerationism-how-a-fringe-philosophy-predicted-the-future-we-live-in/ An excerpt: “Accelerationists argue that technology, particularly computer technology, and capitalism, particularly the most aggressive, global variety, should be massively sped up and intensified – either because this is the best way forward for humanity, or because there is no alternative. Accelerationists favour automation. They favour the further merging of the digital and the human. They often favour the deregulation of business, and drastically scaled-back government. They believe that people should stop deluding themselves that economic and technological progress can be controlled. They often believe that social and political upheaval has a value in itself. Accelerationism, therefore, goes against conservatism, traditional socialism, social democracy, environmentalism, protectionism, populism, nationalism, localism and all the other ideologies that have sought to moderate or reverse the already hugely disruptive, seemingly runaway pace of change in the modern world…” Be sure to catch such quotes as this: “We all live in an operating system set up by the accelerating triad of war, capitalism and emergent AI,” says Steve Goodman, a British accelerationist… That should remind one of this: “Musk is persuaded that we’re living in a simulation, and he or a fellow true believer has hired programmers to try to hack it….” Reply ↓ Oregoncharles May 19, 2017 at 1:58 pm “Boycotts won’t work, since opting out of a site like Google means opting out of much of modern life.” I wish he wouldn’t keep dropping into openly delusional statements like that.

Socio-economics, though, it’s heavy on the libertarianism, albeit with some support for utopian government concepts like UBI, plus a futurist outlook out of that Rationality cult; Yudkowsky and his LessWrong nonsense have influence over a lot of players, big and small, in the bay area.

That sounds like something a Clintonite would say. It sounds like something that many millions of Clintonites DID say, over and over and over again. Clinton got more popular votes? She got almost all of them in California. So Mr. Ceglowski thinks Clinton should be President based on that? That means Mr. Ceglowski wants the entire rest of America to be California’s colonial possession, ruled by a President that California picked. And don’t think we Midwestern Deplorables don’t understand exACTly how Ceglowski thinks and what Ceglowski thinks of us out here in Deploristan. Some Clinton supporters are smarter than that. Some were not surprised. Michael Moore was not surprised. He predicted that we Deploristani Midwesterners would make Trump President whether the digitally beautiful people liked it or not.

Reply ↓ edr May 19, 2017 at 10:45 pm Wisdom Seeker May 19, 2017 at 12:39 pm “capitalism creates vast wealth inequality: that’s the whole point.” Not in Adam Smith’s world, nor Henry Ford’s. True capitalists prosper by creating wealth which improves the lives of everyone around them. Crony capitalists, the ones we have now, strip wealth from others. Witness today’s bubble-and-bust cycles rather than the prior widespread economic growth. …….time to restore Antitrust Law and apply it to the internet monopolists. And restore privacy rights… “ APPLY THE ANTI-TRUST LAWS That’s exactly what’s needed. These ANTI-TRUST LAWS are on the books and stopped being rigorously enforced in the 70s, coinciding with the beginning of the drop in wages. The giant Corporations pull all the profits to a few centralized locations and accumulate the POWER that goes with it, POLITICAL BUYING POWER, which they’ve drained from the cities and small business people, reducing them to clerks instead of owners. Some of those anti-trust laws forbade any business from having more that 7% of the sales in any city; Google, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft, and Apple and of course Walmart are way over those numbers. Monopolies are a huge threat to democracy. http://washingtonmonthly.com/magazine/junejulyaug-2016/populism-with-a-brain/ Restoring Privacy Rights and control over our own data is a very important aspect of what should be accomplished.

Credit: Apple) No laptop is problem-free and even some of the top global laptop suppliers ship lemons sometimes. Inevitably, some software programs will cause trouble. That said, here are some of the best laptops to consider if you’re in the market, including ones from Apple, Samsung, HP and more. Chromebook popularity takes off Chromebooks are surging in the education market, largely due to their low prices. The newest Chromebooks are cheap but also fast, stable, secure, and easy to keep up to date via quick, non-intrusive Google updates. Apps include Google Docs, Google Play Music, photo editors, social apps, and basically anything you can access online like Skype or Microsoft Office. And most software is free. Of the many Chromebooks out there, here are three to consider: Related Image Expand / Collapse (Asus Chromebook Flip. Credit: Asus) Asus Chromebook Flip C302CA: The $499 laptop has a premium design with solid specs and it invariably gets good reviews. Samsung Chromebook Pro: This is another entry in a new breed of premium Chromebooks and is available soon. Prices will start around $550. HP Chromebook 13 G1: Another in the line of premium Chromebooks, this HP model starts at $499. It has a premium, all-metal design with a very-high-resolution display. APPLE IS BEING HURT BY RUMORS AND ITS CEO ISN'T HAPPY Crave-worthy consumer laptops  This category has lots of good laptops, so it’s always a tough call because you invariably leave out other top-notch contenders. Here are three that stand out. (Note that all laptops listed below come with touch screens.) Related Image Expand / Collapse (Dell XPS 13 2-in-1. Credit: Dell) Dell XPS 13 2-in-1: The standard Dell XPS 13 clamshell laptop has always been popular with consumers and businesses. Dell now has the XPS 13 2-in-1 -- with 360-degree hinge -- that can switch between tablet and “tent” modes. This very-compact and light 13-inch design is almost a steal starting at $999. HP 13.3-inch Spectre x360: HP's offering has a high-quality aluminum chassis, a display that rotates 360 degrees, an extra-large trackpad and good battery life. It starts at about $1,090 at HP’s website. Apple MacBook Pro 13 (late 2016): The MacBook is always a good bet. Apple’s latest 13-inch MacBook Pro comes with or without a Touch Bar – a narrow touch-display control strip at the top of the keyboard that dynamically adjusts to the specific task you’re doing. The non-Touch-Bar model starts at $1,499 and the Touch Bar version, $1,799. But note that there are lots of sales at major online retailers, who often knock off between $100 and $200. Taking care of business  The best laptops for businesses are never cheap and that’s the case here. HP EliteBook X360: HP recently added the X360 to its premium EliteBook line of business laptops. The 13-inch EliteBook X360 is about as good as a business laptop gets. HP has been building laptops for Fortune 500 companies for a long time and it shows. The Elitebook X360 is sturdy, light, and fast. And has good battery life and an excellent display. It starts $1,319 on HP’s website. Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon: This Lenovo offering boasts solid performance, stellar battery life, and is very light for a 14-inch laptop (2.5 pounds). It starts at around $1,300. Dell XPS 13: The standard clamshell XPS 13 offers a good balance of size, weight, performance, battery life, and price. Pricing starts at an affordable $799.99. APPLE MAY GO AFTER VENMO, BUT WHY? Compact laptops are popular  Small laptops that don’t feel like dead weight in your backpack are a niche category but a godsend for some frequent travelers. Here are some good options. Related Image Expand / Collapse ( 12-inch MacBook. Credit: Apple) 12-inch Retina MacBook: It’s only 2 pounds, has an innovative Butterfly keyboard, a gorgeous display, and offers relatively snappy performance for its size. It starts at $1,299 from Apple but is often discounted, sometimes by as much as $300. HP EliteBook Folio G1: This is almost as small, thin, and light as the 12-inch MacBook. The 2.1 pound, 12.5-inch Folio starts at $1,039 from HP but can be often found for less at online retailers. AMAZON JUST ANNOUNCED THE ECHO LOOK, A NEW CAMERA AND STYLE ASSISTANT Best gaming laptops  Based on ratings from major review sites, here are three of the best laptops for playing games, all of which sport heavy duty computing power. Related Image Expand / Collapse (Razer Blade Pro. Credit: Razer) Razer Blade Pro: This laptop packs Nvidia's fastest graphics card in a thin design. Comes with a mechanical keyboard and a 4K-resolution touchscreen – and a high price: typically close to $4,000. Alienware 13 R3: The high-end model sports a novel OLED display (used on smartphones but rarely on laptops), good keyboard and graphics. It starts at just under $1,000 from Dell. Asus ROG Strix GL502: This Asus offering is great at gaming in 1080p, good screen, performance, and sound. It can be had starting at around $1,200.   Advertisement Trending in Tech UFO hunter claims proof of giant alien ship that crashed 'millions of years ago' Best laptops for summer 2017: MacBook, HP EliteBook, Asus rank high NASA showed off an image of what Earth looked like in 1969 Paige Jennings, Wall Street intern turned porn star, is now trying her hand at YouTube SOFIC slideshow: 13 eye-popping weapons on display Site Index Sections Home Video Politics U.S. Opinion Entertainment Tech Science Health Travel Lifestyle World Sports Weather On Air Tools Live Video Newsletters Alerts Podcasts Radio Apps & Products About Careers College Students Fox Around the World Advertise With Us New Terms of Use (What's New) New Privacy Policy Ad Choices Help Email Newsroom Media Relations Closed Captioning Policy Follow Facebook Twitter Google+ Instagram RSS Newsletters Fox News Back to Top This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. 2017 FOX News Network, LLC.

"Apple is selling iPhone SE in India at select stores. These phones were assembled in India on trial basis in limited quantities," an industry source told PTI. Apple did not comment on the development. The technology major a couple of days back had said that it was "beginning initial production of a small number of iPhone SE in Bengaluru". "The high-end India-made iPhones (iPhone SE) have already hit the Indian market. These have been on sale from May 2 onwards," another source said. A picture shared by the source showed details of the iPhone SE with 32GB storage capacity with 'Designed by Apple in California, Assembled in India' printed on the box. The picture showed the price of Rs 27,200 inclusive of all taxes on the box. The source also said the Cupertino-based maker of iPhones and iPads had completed the manufacturing of iPhones SEs in Bengaluru in April. The units are assembled by Apple's Taiwanese manufacturing partner Wistron Corp. Earlier, Karnataka IT Minister Priyank Kharge had told PTI that the making of iPhones in India would help Apple lower prices and gain a foothold in the Indian market. He had also expressed hope that it would bring in much needed taxes to the state as well. Apple wants to bring its component manufacturers to India to make parts and export finished phones and is seeking tax concessions on import of key components. However, the central government has rejected most of the demands of the US company. Kharge also had said if the Centre was keen on taking on China, it should not give special treatment to Apple alone, but to other players like Samsung and Lenovo also if they are desirous of opening manufacturing units in India. Kharge had said the government should also give companies, including Apple, certain timelines, subsidies and incentives to create a level-playing field.

The device’s monthly shipment volume is now expected to grow to 600,000 units in July, up from around 500,000 units currently. The Cupertino company is hoping to achieve annual shipments of the new tablet in excess of five million units in 2017. The 10.5-inch iPad Pro model reportedly entered mass production in March-April. Watchers expect demand for the recently launched $329 iPad model “to pick up strongly” starting at the end of the quarter, reaching its peak in the next quarter when the device’s monthly shipments could pass four million units in June and July, the market watchers noted. As for the 12.9-inch iPad Pro model, Apple is expected to update its highest-resolution iOS device at some point this year, with some supply chain sources saying a second-generation 12.9-inch iPad Pro model could enter mass production in June. “Sources from the upstream supply chain noted that Apple’s inexpensive 9.7-inch iPad is expected to accelerate Apple’s pace on phasing out the iPad mini 4 from the market,” as was rumored earlier this week. Subscribe to iDownloadBlog on YouTube Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo gave the 10.5-inch iPad Pro model 70-30 odds of being announced at Apple’s annual Worldwide Developers Conference next month. In a recent note to clients, Kuo wrote that Apple’s engineers were able to squeeze a 10.5-inch display into a form factor similar to the existing 9.7-inch iPad models due to the narrower side bezels on the upcoming tablet. “The newly designed 10.5-inch iPad Pro will have a similar form factor to the 9.7-inch model, but will feature a larger display thanks to narrow bezels,” said the analyst. Kuo believes that the overhauled design of the device should help improve the user experience and boost traction in the corporate and commercial sectors. Apple has reportedly commissioned Foxconn to assemble the 10.5-inch iPad Pro model. General Interface Solution will be the sole supplier of touch panels for the device. The same supplier provides 3D Touch components for existing iPhones and is said to have landed orders for the three times pricier 3D Touch parts for the OLED-based iPhone 8 model. KGI forecast 10.5-inch iPad Pro shipments of five to six million units in fiscal 2017, accounting for fifteen percent of total fiscal 2017 iPad shipments.

These phones were assembled in India on trial basis in limited quantities,” an industry source said. Apple did not comment on the development.

These have been on sale from May 2 onwards,” another source said.

The chief executive has been spotted wearing the device around the Apple campus in Cupertino, according to CNBC , with sources claiming the company is already conducting feasibility trials in the Bay Area. Cook has previously spoken about Apple's commitment to improving healthcare, and about the struggles faced by people with diabetes. "It's mentally anguishing to stick yourself many times a day to check your blood sugar," he said during a speech at the University of Glasgow in February. Diabetics normally have to pierce their skin to test their blood sugar (Photo: Getty) "There is lots of hope out there that if someone has constant knowledge of what they're eating, they can instantly know what causes the response... and that they can adjust well before they become diabetic." Cook revealed at the time that he had been been wearing a continuous glucose monitor for "a few weeks", in order to understand how his blood sugar responded to foods he was eating. Read More Apple becomes first US company to top $800 BILLION valuation He implied that such a device could be useful for people wanting to cut down their sugar consumption, as well as for diabetes sufferers. Then, last month, CNBC reported that Apple had hired a team of biomedical engineers as part of a "secret" initiative to develop sensors to treat diabetes . Apple Watch The initiative, which has reportedly been in the works for at least five years, was originally envisioned by late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs. The aim is to develop sensors that can continuously monitor blood sugar levels without piercing the skin - something that is widely regarded as the "holy grail" for life sciences. Read More Apple boss Tim Cook says iPhone 8 rumours are to blame for lacklustre iPhone sales Jobs envisioned a wearable device, like a smartwatch, being used to monitor blood glucose, but many life sciences companies have tried and failed to create such a device One of the sources told CNBC that Apple is developing optical sensors, which shine a light through the skin to measure indications of glucose.

The US-based technology major Apple has started selling iPhones at select stores in the country that were assembled in India as part of its trial run. "Apple is selling iPhone SE in India at select stores. These phones were assembled in India on trial basis in limited quantities," an industry source told PTI. Apple did not comment on the development. The technology major a couple of days back had said that it was "beginning initial production of a small number of iPhone SE in Bengaluru". "The high-end India-made iPhones (iPhone SE) have already hit the Indian market. These have been on sale from May 2 onwards," another source said. A picture shared by the source showed details of the iPhone SE with 32GB storage capacity with 'Designed by Apple in California, Assembled in India' printed on the box. The picture showed the price of Rs 27,200 inclusive of all taxes on the box. The source also said the Cupertino-based maker of iPhones and iPads had completed the manufacturing of iPhones SEs in Bengaluru in April. The units are assembled by Apple's Taiwanese manufacturing partner Wistron Corp. Earlier, Karnataka IT Minister Priyank Kharge had told PTI that the making of iPhones in India would help Apple lower prices and gain a foothold in the Indian market. He had also expressed hope that it would bring in much needed taxes to the state as well. Apple wants to bring its component manufacturers to India to make parts and export finished phones and is seeking tax concessions on import of key components. However, the central government has rejected most of the demands of the US company. Kharge also had said if the Centre was keen on taking on China, it should not give special treatment to Apple alone, but to other players like Samsung and Lenovo also if they are desirous of opening manufacturing units in India. Kharge had said the government should also give companies, including Apple, certain timelines, subsidies and incentives to create a level-playing field.

The glucose monitor could provide real-time information for millions on how exercise and food changes blood sugar levels. It is described as the 'holy grail' of life sciences, because it's difficult to monitor blood sugar without breaking the skin.  Scroll down for video Apple CEO Tim Cook (pictured) displays his personal Apple Watch to customers at an Apple Store on April 10, 2015 in Palo Alto, California. According to a new report he is trailing a wearable glucose monitor  THE PROJECT  Apple has hired a team of biomedical engineers to develop non-invasive sensors which could detect diabetes and monitor blood-sugar levels. The engineers are expected to work at a nondescript office in Palo Alto, around 15 miles away from the new corporate headquarters in Cupertino, California. If the non-invasive sensors come to fruition, it would be a breakthrough moment for medical science.  The late Apple CEO Steve Jobs envisaged the devices as another form of wearable technology, similar to a smartwatch or fitness monitor.  Cook has been spotted trailing a prototype of the wearable device on the Apple campus, according to CNBC. In February Cook told students at the University of Glasgow he was 'really excited' about its potential in health care. 'I've been wearing a continuous glucose monitor for a few weeks,' he told the students.  'I just took it off before coming on this trip', he said.  Sources suggests the company is already doing trials in the Bay Area. The project - envisioned by co-founder Steve Jobs before his death - could lead to 'breakthrough' wearable devices that detect the disease and monitor blood-sugar levels. Apple has hired a team of biomedical engineers as part of the secret initiative, according to reports in CNBC. Up to 30 people are believed to be working on the project, which has be running for five years - according to CNBC's sources.  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Facebook and Twitter should display pop-up warning signs if...

The engineers are said to be working from a nondescript office in Palo Alto, around 15 miles away from the new Apple corporate headquarters in Cupertino, California. Apple has hired a team of biomedical engineers to develop non-invasive sensors which could detect diabetes and monitor blood-sugar levels (stock image) The researchers have been tasked with developing bio-sensors to monitor blood sugar levels.  Currently this involves taking regular blood samples, which can involve anything from a thumb-prick test to intravenous extraction. WHAT IS DIABETES  Diabetes is a chronic disease that occurs either when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin or when the body cannot effectively use the insulin it produces.  Insulin is a hormone that regulates blood sugar Hyperglycaemia, or raised blood sugar, is a common effect of uncontrolled diabetes and over time leads to serious damage to many of the body's systems, especially the nerves and blood vessels The number of people with diabetes has risen from 108 million in 1980 to 422 million in 2014 - the latest year for which global figures are available - according to the World Heath Organisation. The late Apple CEO envisaged the devices as another form of wearable technology, similar to a smartwatch or fitness monitors  And if the non-invasive sensors come to fruition, it would be a breakthrough moment for medical science.   'There is a cemetery full of efforts' to measure glucose in a non-invasive way, said DexCom chief executive Terrance Gregg, whose firm is known for minimally invasive blood-sugar motechniques.  To succeed would require 'several hundred million dollars or even a billion dollars,' he previously told Reuters. The number of people with diabetes has risen from 108 million in 1980 to 422 million in 2014 - the latest year for which global figures are available - according to the World Heath Organisation. The news comes at a time when the line between pharmaceuticals and technology is blurring. A secret new research project being undertaken by Apple could lead to new sensors to detect diabetes. For many, the condition is managed with daily injections (stock image) Companies are joining forces to tackle chronic diseases using high-tech devices that combine biology, software and hardware. This has jump-starting a new field of medicine called bio-electronics. Last year, GlaxoSmithKline Plc and Google parent Alphabet Inc unveiled a joint company aimed at marketing bio-electronic devices to fight illness by attaching to individual nerves. U.S. biotech firms Setpoint Medical and EnteroMedics Inc have already demonstrated some early progress of bio-electronics in treating rheumatoid arthritis and suppressing appetite in the obese. Other companies exploring the technology include Medtronic Plc, Proteus Digital Technology, Sanofi SA and Biogen Inc. GUM DISEASE: A WARNING SIGN?  Gum disease could be an early warning sign of type 2 diabetes, a study suggests. Experts said dentists who discovered patients with severe gum problems should screen them for the condition.  A study of 313 middle-aged people by the University of Amsterdam found patients with severe gum disease were 23 per cent more likely to have type 2 diabetes, and 47 per cent more likely to have pre-diabetes than those with no gum disease. Writing in the journal BMJ Open Diabetes Research And Care, they said this was because people with diabetes were more susceptible to infections and impaired wound healing. The researchers said it would be feasible to screen for undiagnosed diabetes in dental practices, focusing on people with the most severe form of gum disease. Picking up on diabetes and pre-diabetes early is essential in helping to avoid complications. Some 3.5million people have been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes – but more than 500,000 are living with the condition unknowingly.

MailOnline puts Sony's XB40 to the test Sony SRS-XB40 has a built-in multi-coloured line light, speaker lights and a flashing strobe. It features 24 hours of battery life and claims to be a 'mini-disco on the move'. But does it live up to the claim? Samsung's Galaxy S8: A hefty price tag and a dumb personal assistant Samsung's new Galaxy S8 phone is stunning, but its $100 price hike is hard to swallow. Overall the S8 is for those who want elegance - and are willing to pay for it. Affordable, robust and surprisingly responsive: Samsung's Galaxy A5 With the eagerly awaited Galaxy S8 having been pushed back, South Korea-based Samsung has plugged the gap with the Samsung Galaxy A5, a high-end device with a mid-range price tag. Is it really worth paying £280 for Nintendo's Switch? MailOnline's verdict While the design is impressive and easy to use, the game line up is disappointing. Google's Daydream: The $79 headset that could bring VR to the masses Google's $79 headset is superb in terms of hardware - but is currently let down by a lack of apps. However, it has absolutely huge potential to finally bring VR to the masses. Welcome Home: Google's $130 smart speaker Google's smart Home speaker still has a lot of learning to do, and loses out to Amazon's Echo in some areas - but has incredible potential 'Not quite an iPhone replacement': Google's Pixel phone Google's Pixel handset is good, and boasts an amazing camera and smart assistant. It's the king of the Android handsets - but still not great. Xbox One S review: Console that will make your 4K TV shine Microsoft's Xbox One S has shrunk the giant console by 40%, and is stunningly designed console with 4K HDR capabilities - but comes with some caveats. The $1,000 wireless speaker that really IS worth the price: Naim Mu-so Qb review Naim's incredible Mu-So Qb takes you back to the good old days - where the music captivates and enthralls, rather that simply being something in the background. The hi-tech $2,000 spin bike that really could change your life Peloton's hi-tech bike lets you stream live and on demand rides to your home - and it's one of the best examples of fitness technology out there - at a price. Apple's new 9.7inch iPad Pro is a powerhouse you can take anywhere Apple has added a few improvements to the smaller version, creating a tablet that is astonishingly powerful, but, unlike its big brother, is something you'll be able to carry everywhere. Speaker that looks as good as its sounds: B&W Zeppelin Wireless review It's not cheap, but the $699 (£500) Zeppelin Wireless is perfect for the design conscious music fan. The best all in one wireless speaker you'll ever hear: Naim Mu-so review It might not be a name familiar to the US market, but Naim is a legendary British brand hoping to make a splash with the American launch of its $1499 Mu:So speaker.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: 3 Top Phablet Stocks to Buy in 2017 Apple, Samsung, and Universal Display prove that bigger is better. Chris Neiger (TMFNewsie) May 19, 2017 at 8:11AM A phablet is simply a large smartphone -- a phone-tablet. The term came about a few years ago as smartphones began to grow in size and some became nearly indistinguishable from smaller tablets.  Phablets account for a large portion of smartphone sales. They accounted for as much as 25% of sales in 2015, and their share is expected to grow to 32% by 2020, according to IDC estimates. And with that growth, there are three top stocks most likely to benefit: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF), and Universal Display (NASDAQ:OLED). Image source: Apple. Apple's big business It's a no surprise Apple heads the list of top phablet stocks. The company sold 50.7 million iPhones in its fiscal second quarter of 2017, and the company earned about 63% of its total revenue in the quarter from those sales.  At least part of the company's solid quarter can be contributed to Apple's largest phone, the iPhone 7 Plus. "We are proud to report a strong March quarter, with revenue growth accelerating from the December quarter and continued robust demand for iPhone 7 Plus," Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a press release.  And it's not just Cook who views Apple's largest phone as an asset. The iPhone 7 Plus was the world's second best-selling phone in the first quarter of this year, surpassed only by the iPhone 7, according to Strategy Analytics.  There's reason to believe that the rest of 2017 will bode well for Apple and its larger phones as well. Several rumors have surfaced that Apple could launch a larger 5.8-inch phone (up from the 5.5-inch iPhone 7 Plus) as one of its new iPhone 8 models this fall. Investors may remember that when Apple bumped up the screen sizes for its iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, it sparked a sales boom a few years ago. There's no guarantee of seeing that for the next iPhone of course, but a larger, no-bezel iPhone could certainly spur its own upgrade cycle demand.  Samsung scalable success  Samsung was one of the early leaders in the phablet space and overall, things have worked out tremendously well. The company's larger phones have been a key ingredient in keeping pace with Apple's popular, albeit smaller, iPhones. Samsung hit a few speed bumps with its smartphone sales in 2016, mainly from less-than-stellar Galaxy S6 demand and the infamous recall of its Galaxy Note 7 -- which was, er, prone to catching on fire. But things appear to be turning around for the phablet maker. Samsung's new Galaxy S8 and S8+ phones have impressive 5.8-inch and 6.2-inch displayswith no-bezel screens. Image source: Samsung. Samsung made more than 50% of its 2016 revenue from its IT and mobile communications segments, and the new S8 and S8+ phablets should go a long way toward helping to keep mobile revenue up for 2017. A report from South Korean website The Investor says Samsung has already racked up 5 million global sales since the devices went on sale a month ago.     It will still be a couple of months before we find out how well the S8 lineup has performed for Samsung, but some sales estimates for the devices are projected to hit 60 million for the full year, up from 52 million for last year's S7 lineup. Universal Display's larger-than-life licensing fees Universal Display licenses the research and technology it develops for OLED displays and sells some of the raw materials used to make the displays as well. The company's biggest customers are LG and Samsung, and the majority of its sales come from smartphones and tablets. Universal has a lucrative licensing deal with Samsung that's worth $90 million for 2017, up from $75 million last year, and LG is currently locked into a licensing agreement with the company until 2022. Image source: Getty Images. Universal is just coming off a fantastic first quarter, with revenue up more than 87% and net income skyrocketing from $1.9 million to $8.5 million year over year. The company's licensing-fee revenue, which doesn't include the current deal with Samsung, totaled $7 million in the quarter, up 32% year over year.  The company's CFO, Sidney Rosenblatt, expects much more growth from OLED market as well, noting in a press release that management believes the market is "poised to grow faster" than previously expected. The company believes the expanding OLED segment will translate into more licensing revenue and sales, which should boost 2017 revenue by 30% to 40% compared with last year.  Investors looking for the top phablet stocks for 2017 should give these companies strong consideration, and remember that even though large phones have been on the market for a while, there's still plenty of room in this segment for more growth.  Chris Neiger has no position in any stocks mentioned.

"Apple is selling iPhone SE in India at select stores. These phones were assembled in India on trial basis in limited quantities," an industry source told PTI. Apple did not comment on the development. The technology major a couple of days back had said that it was "beginning initial production of a small number of iPhone SE in Bengaluru". "The high-end India-made iPhones (iPhone SE) have already hit the Indian market. These have been on sale from May 2 onwards," another source said. A picture shared by the source showed details of the iPhone SE with 32GB storage capacity with 'Designed by Apple in California, Assembled in India' printed on the box. The picture showed the price of Rs 27,200 inclusive of all taxes on the box. The source also said the Cupertino-based maker of iPhones and iPads had completed the manufacturing of iPhones SEs in Bengaluru in April. The units are assembled by Apple's Taiwanese manufacturing partner Wistron Corp. Earlier, Karnataka IT Minister Priyank Kharge had told PTI that the making of iPhones in India would help Apple lower prices and gain a foothold in the Indian market. He had also expressed hope that it would bring in much needed taxes to the state as well. Apple wants to bring its component manufacturers to India to make parts and export finished phones and is seeking tax concessions on import of key components. However, the central government has rejected most of the demands of the US company. Kharge also had said if the Centre was keen on taking on China, it should not give special treatment to Apple alone, but to other players like Samsung and Lenovo also if they are desirous of opening manufacturing units in India. Kharge had said the government should also give companies, including Apple, certain timelines, subsidies and incentives to create a level-playing field.

We learned back in February that Apple was formally opposing a bill in Nebraska that would have given consumers and independent repair shops the legal right to buy spare parts and to access service manuals in order to carry out their own repairs. That opposition was successful, lawmakers backing down. Apple is currently fighting attempts to introduce a Fair Repair Act in New York after successfully defeating similar bills in both 2015 and 2016 … NordVPN Motherboard reports that state records show which companies are lobbying against the bill, and the sums they have spent doing so. The records show that companies and organizations lobbying against right to repair legislation spent $366,634 to retain lobbyists in the state between January and April of this year. Thus far, the Digital Right to Repair Coalition—which is generally made up of independent repair shops with several employees—is the only organization publicly lobbying for the legislation. It has spent $5,042 on the effort, according to the records. The piece notes that this is an aggregate sum, covering all political lobbying by the companies named, but notes that Apple is spending $9,000 per month to one law firm for lobbying work, and that the Fair Repair Act is one of only three bills Apple lobbied on in March and April. Apple argues that DIY repairs can compromise both the safety and security of devices, citing the fire risks posed by lithium-ion batteries and the security risks of unknown companies accessing devices that rely on hardware like Touch ID for their security. The latter argument came to a head last year when it was discovered that replacing the Home button on an iPhone 6 resulted in the devices being deliberately bricked. When iPhone is serviced by an authorised Apple service provider or Apple retail store for changes that affect the touch ID sensor, the pairing is re-validated. This check ensures the device and the iOS features related to touch ID remain secure. Without this unique pairing, a malicious touch ID sensor could be substituted, thereby gaining access to the secure enclave. When iOS detects that the pairing fails, touch ID, including Apple Pay, is disabled so the device remains secure. The Fair Repair Act (Senate Bill S618A) is current at the committee stage. If it goes forward from there, it will need to pass votes in both state Senate and Assembly and be signed by the Governor in order to become law.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 19 May 2017 by Abhishek Budholiya Global Apple Accessories Market expected to grow at 4.6% CAGR over 2016-2020 The global Apple accessories market is expected to grow at 4.6% CAGR over the forecast period, 2016-2020. Demand is expected to remain strong in China, where rapid adoption of smartphones, combined with an increasing preference towards the ‘Apple’ brand is pushing sales. The market in China is expected to grow at 8.5% CAGR through the forecast period. Globally, the demand for Apple accessories is expected to be positively influenced by the growing BYOD trend. Weak distribution channels in emerging markets have remained a longstanding challenge for manufacturers. However, popularity of e-commerce and focus on creating alternative distribution channels have positively impacted Apple accessories sales in emerging markets. The steady growth in these markets is expected to offset weak demand in developed markets of the U.S. and Europe. Request Report Sample@ http://www.futuremarketinsights.com/reports/sample/rep-gb-3374 Apple accessories sales in Asia will be driven by rising popularity of e-commerce websites and apps. As is the case in Asia, steady e-commerce sales are driving Apple accessories sales in Brazil and Russia. These factors will contribute to the overall growth of the global market. Future Market Insights identifies that undefined standards in terms of components and technology have led to price and product differentiation. Moreover, widespread availability of counterfeit and pirated products offered at a fraction of the original price in various developing countries can significantly inhibit demand for Apple accessories. The Future Market Insights report reveals that iPhone screen guards will continue to be the most-sought after accessory among consumers. iPad cases and iPad screen guards are expected to remain the other lucrative product types. Collectively, these three product segments accounted for over 50% revenue share of the global market in 2016, and the status quo will remain unchanged throughout the forecast period. Among these product types, iPad cases segment will only witness an increase in its revenue share by 2020. North America will continue to be the most lucrative market, with the US leading total sales. The North America Apple accessories market was valued at US$ 1.93 Bn in 2016, with the US accounting for US$ 1.38 Bn in revenues. Future Market Insights projects the North America market revenues to increase at a CAGR of 4% CAGR through 2020. The report further reveals that the Apple accessories market in Europe is predicted to register a CAGR of 4.0% in the span of next four years. However, the Apple accessories market in South East Asia is expected to witness relatively sluggish growth by the end of 2020.

As it turns out, none other than CEO Tim Cook has been spotted wearing what appeared to be an Apple Watch-connected glucose tracker in the vicinity of the company campus, CNBC reports. Unfortunately, details remain pretty scarce as of now – with the exception that the new wearable module is directly connected to the Watch. Assuming the Big A manages to fine-tune the rumored blood sugar tracker, the technology could become a must-have for millions of people suffering from – or at risk of getting – diabetes. Apple was first rumored to be working on a dedicated diabetes wearable back in April, when CNBC reported the company has assembled a secret super-team of bioengineers to craft a solution for tracking blood sugar levels with the Watch. Speaking at the University of Glasgow earlier in February, Cook said he had “been wearing a continuous glucose monitor for a few weeks” but stopped short of making any significant revelation about the gadget. One thing the Apple chief clarified though is that the device would also make it easier for people to responsibly monitor their blood sugar levels and avoid health complications. “It’s mentally anguishing to stick yourself many times a day to check your blood sugar,” he commented. “There is lots of hope out there that if someone has constant knowledge of what they’re eating, they can instantly know what causes the response… and that they can adjust well before they become diabetic.” on CNBC Read next: Microsoft's new Surface Pro just leaked, but it's not a 'Pro 5' AppleApple WatchGearTim Cook Share on Facebook (89) Share on Twitter (212) Mix is a reporter from Amsterdam.

Computing Phones Cars Gaming Science Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Mobile Apple is Lobbying Against Right-to-Repair Legislation Across the Country Apple is Lobbying Against Right-to-Repair Legislation Across the Country By Joel Hruska on May 19, 2017 at 7:30 am Comment Over the past few years, there’s been a burgeoning movement to guarantee the right of citizens to repair their own electronic devices, and a rise in corporate lobbying designed to defeat these initiatives. In some cases, companies like John Deere have argued that the firmware they run on a tractor constitutes a trade secret that farmers cannot be allowed to access. Companies like Apple have tended to take a subtler route and not advertise its stance as much. But public access records in New York State reveal that the company is putting serious effort behind its push to prevent such bills from becoming law. The Fair Repair Act under consideration in New York State “requires manufacturers of digital electronic parts to offer for sale diagnostic and repair information in the same manner as such manufacturer provides such diagnostic and repair information to such manufacturer’s repair channel; section does not apply to motor vehicles.” This is explicitly tailored not to raise the tractor question or to raise the specter of people using these tools to make damaging changes to their vehicles. Some have argued that the ability to tinker within a car’s Engine Control Unit (ECU) could lead to unsafe conditions or damage the vehicle permanently. Whether you agree or disagree, that’s clearly not on the table here. In Nebraska, Apple tried arguing that passing a right-to-repair bill would make the state a “Mecca” for hackers, as if the digital elite are going to decamp for corn country on the promise of… fixing iPhones? “Go West young man” hardly seems to fit. The “Error 53” error started cropping up on iPhones when Apple updated them and broke previous third-party repairs. Plenty of companies have lobbied against these bills, which are making their way through statehouses across the country, but Apple has focused particularly strongly on New York Senate bill 618A. It’s one of just three pieces of legislation that Apple lobbied over in March and April, and the company lobbied against it in 2015 and 2016 as well. Collectively, the companies opposing the right to repair spent $366,634 between January and April to retain lobbyists to promote that view. The Digital Right to Repair Coalition is the only organization sponsoring the bill, and it’s spent $5,042 in favor of it. Apple has a long history of being opposed to anyone being allowed to work on its products. The company went so far as to introduce an iPhone-breaking DRM bug with a new version of its operating system that locked people out of their iDevices if they had previously had certain problems repaired at third-party facilities. Apple defended this as a security measure, but was forced to backtrack somewhat after enormous public outcry. But it’s a reminder that to these companies, your right to take apart, upgrade, or modify your own hardware is an assault on their business model and what they see as their god-given right to deprive you of income via repair fees or simply requiring you to buy a new device. They don’t take kindly to disruptions to that train of revenue.

It was a nightmare. Yet the make of the headphones was somehow suppressed. We now learn that they were Apple headphones. Apple however makes it clear, the problem wasn't the headphones but rather the batteries and won't be paying compensation of any kind.   The Australian Associated Press reports today that "An Australian woman whose face, hands and hair were burned when her headphones exploded on a plane won't be compensated by manufacturer Apple because third-party batteries were at fault.   The woman, who wishes to remain anonymous, was napping on a Beijing to Melbourne flight in February when she was awoken by the sound of an explosion and a burning sensation on her face.   "Our investigation indicated the issue was caused by a third-party battery," an Apple representative said in a statement issued by the woman's lawyers on Friday.   The woman, whose face, hands and hair were burned, had sought to be reimbursed to replace her headphones and several items of ruined clothing.   She says she bought the headphones duty-free in 2014 and the AAA batteries in Australia.   She says she was extremely disappointed with Apple's decision.   "The headphones don't work without batteries, yet nowhere on the headphones - or their packaging - did it specify which brand of batteries should be used," she says in a statement.     About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Business & Tech Margrethe Vestager. Picture by: Yves Logghe / AP/Press Association Images 12:46 19 May 2017 Craig Fitzpatrick 19 hours ago European Commissioner for Competition Margrethe Vestager has criticised Ireland over the length of time it is taking to recover unpaid Apple tax. In an interview with CNBC, the Danish politician complained that the Government is "taking too long" on the issue but is hopeful that the €13 billion will be retrieved from the Cupertino tech giant "very soon". Vestager also dismissed concerns that the European Commission's August 2016 ruling that Ireland had granted Apple illegal tax benefits would harm future investment in Europe. "I haven't seen any evidence of that," she said. A commission spokesperson echoed Vestager's sentiment that patience was running out, calling for "material progress to implement recover" of the back taxes.  They stated: "If member states fail to meet their obligation, the commission may decide to refer them to the EU courts for failure to implement a state aid decision, in line with the EU Treaty." The deadline for the recovery was in early January, though the Department of Finance has justified the delay by saying that it is relatively standard practice and that it was currently working with both the EC and Apple on the issue. A spokesperson for Finance Minister Michael Noonan said: "Although the formal deadline has now passed, it is not unusual or uncommon for member states to require more time for recovery. "Irish officials are continuing this intensive work to ensure that the State complies with all our recovery obligations as soon as possible, and remain in regular contact with the commission and Apple." The EC noted that it was aware that some recoveries in these cases can be "more complex than in others, and thus may require some more time," but stressed that Ireland "must demonstrate progress on recovery". The recovered money is set to be held in an escrow account while Ireland and Apple's legal challenges to the ruling go through the EU courts. 12:46 19 May 2017 Craig Fitzpatrick 19 hours ago 4 Related articles The Enda austerity RIP to the MP3 EU tech firms warn that Apple and Google are abusing their power Here are the top 20 companies to work for in 2017, according to LinkedIn most popular latest sport #PornWeek: The A to Z - by way of XXX - of pornography Map reveals the most common words on Wikipedia LOI Premier Division Round-Up: Five star Cork City bounce back Leinster stunned by Scarlets site terms privacy advertise with us contact competitions apps appliancesdelivered.ie © Copyright 2015 - Newstalk Ltd.

U.S. Editions Australia Edition China Edition India Edition Italy Edition Japan Edition Singapore Edition United Kingdom United States May 20, 2:43 AM EDT Subscribe Search Search Business Technology World National Media & Culture Millennial Money Entertainment Sports Subscribe Technology Apple Watch 3 Might Have Flexible Display, Patent Hints By Rishabh Jain On 05/19/17 AT 8:16 AM Close A patent published by the United States Patents and Trademarks Office Thursday, shows the company is working on endowing the Apple Watch 3 with a flexible display. Apple will be using a special kind of glass called the willow glass. Willow Glass is known for its flexibility and strength. Apple called it “one exemplary flexible glass substrate” in its patent filing. It also states the display would be a standard flexible one which will be rollable, wearable and foldable, said a Patently Apple report. Another feature of the smartwatch, according to the filing, could include a flexible display, covering not just dial of the smartwatch but even the band. The company seems to be working on a screen that could be wrapped around a user’s wrist, according to a Digital Trends report. Read: iPhone X vs. Samsung Galaxy X: Comparison Review Of Features, Specs And More While the display will get its processing power and battery from a panel inside the smartwatch, the usable surface area of the device for a user would be larger than any smartwatch currently available. The panel could also include a communication module for LTE connectivity, which would let the Apple Watch work as a separate device independent of a phone. The technology could even be used for larger devices such as phones and TVs, the patent says. Apple has been rumored to be working on the concept since 2015, but it was rival Samsung, which first showcased the technology at CES 2013. Apple isn’t depending on just the iPhone 8 to maintain its market share in 2017, it is also expected to come out with the Apple Watch 3. The smartwatch is expected to come with features such as RFID tracking for food items and LTE, said a ValueWalk report. Both Apple and Samsung are expected to come out with flexible ‘X’ series devices this year. Samsung has two concepts in the fray — a flexible display like the one it showcased in 2013 and an inside-out folding display, which can be folded outwards with two back-to-back displays that can be laid out to form a tablet-esque display. While folded, it might feel like any other smartphone, but with a dual display. Apple’s concept, according to the patent, seems to be inching more towards a display that can be easily worn and requires less space, while giving the user more surface area to work on. Similar to the idea of wearing an Apple iPhone, on your wrist But, the flexible display is not the only feature the smartwatch offers. The major focus of the upcoming smartwatch will be fitness, according to rumors and leaks surrounding the device. BGR reported Monday that it could feature a non-invasive way of glucose monitoring.

Google finally brought its smart digital virtual Assistant to iOS and the iPhone. The move is a big one, and shows how much Google actually cares about its customers who are locked down to the iOS ecosystem. The app however is only available for iPhone users in the US and has yet to make its way to India. I tried out the app for a while (using a US iTunes account) and I am pretty impressed by what Google has achieved with the limited access it gets on Apple’s iPhone. But as I delved deeper I discovered that this opinion depended on two factors, your region and the ecosystem that you are dependent on. My default email ID has been a Gmail account for years. But after switching to iOS a few years ago, I have come to learn that as a reviewer is best to stick to apps and services that are available on both iOS and Android. So after going in for an iPhone a couple of years ago, I found myself switching from Google Drive to Dropbox, from the defacto Gmail app to an email client, from Google Keep to Evernote. The simple idea behind this is that you get most of features that these third-party alternatives to Google apps provide on both devices (iOS and Android) as opposed to sticking to The Apple Notes app and not having the same Notes experience on Android. So when Google announced Assistant for iPhone, I expected the worst. Here’s an assistant that works brilliantly on an Android smartphone, but with Google’s limited access to an iPhones hardware and apps, I expected it to be a complete mess. Turns out, I was wrong. Beginning with your standard stuff in terms of features, there was one big hurdle while using Google’s Assistant. There’s no hot word activation on an iPhone because Apple Siri uses it as her birth right. There’s no access to double tapping the home button to activate either, well, because…. Siri. So Google used iOS’s today screen to make it easier to access Assistant. Just pin the Assistant widget and you have a software button that is accessible from the lock screen with a simple swipe to right. While the implementation is lacking, it was useful nonetheless. As for the rest of the features that you will get on Google Assistant versus Siri on an iPhone, I have put out a simple table below. Features Google Assistant on iPhone Siri on iPhone Trigger No voice trigger or button Voice trigger “Hey Siri” or long press on Home button Separate section to display information and results Yes. In app Yes. Intergrated in iOS Displays contextual information Yes, In widget or notifications Yes Works with Voice and typing Voice Natural language processing Yes Yes Query history Yes No Supported devices Android devices iOS devices and Google Home All devices running iOS, macOS and tvOS What does it connect to? Google apps, third party apps home automation or supported IoT enabled devices and standard TV’s via Chromecast Data stored in your iPhone, home automation or supported IoT devices Undertands… Different accents Has trouble Third party app support Yes Yes Coming to queries, Assistant is smarter and in India can get more done as well. You will need to install all those Google apps like Calendar, YouTube, Maps, Gmail and more to get what you need when you need it. Siri’s result on the left and Google Assistant’s result on the right. But once you have Google apps set up on your phone, Assistant feels full fledged even when compared to the native Siri. A simple example is navigation. I asked Siri “How do I get home from here?” With all her grey matter, she wasn’t able compute the same, because Apple Maps is does not provide navigation in India. Google Assistant however could even take up advanced queries related to navigation, because well, it has the Google Maps app on my iPhone. So here’s a list of To do’s and Can’t Do’s between the two assistants on the iPhone. Queries Google Assistant on iPhone Siri on iPhone Set Reminders Yes Yes Place phone calls Yes Yes Send text messages Yes Yes Send emails Yes. But only if you have Gmail app installed Yes. But only using default Mail app Set calendar event Yes. But only if you have Calendar app installed Yes Play Music Yes. Using Play Music or YouTube Yes. But only Apple music or Spotify Navigation Yes. Using Google Maps Not available for India General queries (weather, calculations etc) Yes Yes Context Yes Yes (limited) Google’s saving grace with Assistant is the fact that it has every single Google service (Calendar, Music, Keep, Maps) in the form of an app, available on a rival operating system. Had Apple made such a move with Siri on Android, it would have been a complete mess. Secondly, even though I have detached myself from a number of Google services I did find it comforting that I had a healthy selection of Google apps available at my disposal, which are good enough to convince me to switch sides. And that I think is Google’s pitch here. Selling the best of its services with a machine learning to connect them all together. Out here in India, it could very well be a better alternative to Siri’s limited capabilities on your iPhone. If you are heavily dependent on Google’s bouquet of apps and services, Google Assistant is literally the cherry on the cake. If you live in the US, Assistant on an iPhone is a great alternative if you are dependent on Google’s apps and services, because if you’re not, Siri would naturally be a better choice because she is available all the time at your beckoning at the push of button.

Apple Inc., (Fed. Cir. May 11, 2017) (Before Moore, Linn, and Stoll, J.) (Opinion for the court, Stoll, J.) The Federal Circuit affirmed the district court’s finding of summary judgment for Apple Inc. (“Apple”). The Court held that statements made by a patent owner during an inter partes review (“IPR”) proceeding, whether before or after an institution decision, can be relied upon to support a finding of prosecution disclaimer. Aylus Networks, Inc. (“Aylus”) owns the ’412 patent, which “provides systems and methods for implementing digital home networks having a control point located on a wide area network.” The patent teaches various network architectures for streaming and displaying media content using combinations of networked components. These networked components include: (1) a media server (“MS”); (2) a media renderer (“MR”); (3) a control point (“CP”) logic that includes logic to negotiate media content delivery with at least one of an MS and an MR; and (4) control point proxy (“CPP”) logic. Aylus sued Apple for infringement of the ’412 patent. Apple filed two separate petitions for IPR with the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (the “Board”), each challenging different claims of the ’412 patent. The Board instituted an IPR on all claims of the ’412 patent, except claims 2, 4, 21, and 23. Following institution, Aylus filed notice of voluntary dismissal in the district court, dismissing with prejudice its infringement contentions as to all of the asserted claims, except claims 2 and 21. Apple then filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that it does not practice the limitation “wherein the CPP logic is invoked to negotiate media content delivery between the MS and the MR.” The district court construed this limitation in claims 2 and 21 to “require that only the CPP logic is invoked to negotiate media content delivery between the MS and the MR, in contrast to claims 1 and 20 which require both the CP and CPP to negotiate media content delivery.” The court relied on statements by Aylus in its preliminary responses to Apple’s IPR petitions, finding the statements “akin to prosecution disclaimer.” Based on its claim construction, the court granted Apple summary judgment of noninfringement of claims 2 and 21. Aylus appealed, arguing that the statements made during an IPR cannot be relied on to support a finding of prosecution disclaimer. Alternatively, Aylus argued that its statements did not constitute a clear and unmistakable disclaimer of claim scope. The Court first addressed whether statements made by a patent owner during an IPR can support a finding of prosecution disclaimer during claim construction. It explained that “when the patentee unequivocally and unambiguously disavows a certain meaning to obtain a patent, the doctrine of prosecution history disclaimer narrows the meaning of the claim consistent with the scope of the claim surrendered.” Such disclaimer can occur through amendment or argument. Prosecution has become “a fundamental precept in [the Court’s] claim construction jurisprudence” which “promotes the public notice function of the intrinsic evidence and protects the public’s reliance on definitive statements made during prosecution.” Prosecution disclaimer ensures that claims are not construed one way in order to obtain their allowance and in a different way against accused infringers. Although this doctrine arose in the context of pre-issuance prosecution, the Court noted that it has also applied it in other post-issuance proceedings before the Patent and Trademark Office (“PTO”). For example, the Court has applied the doctrine based on statements made during reissue and reexamination proceedings. Therefore, the Court found that it should apply the doctrine in IPR proceedings before the PTO. It reasoned that this extension will promote the public notice function of the intrinsic evidence and protect the public’s reliance on definitive statements made during IPR proceedings. Aylus argued that statements made during an IPR are unlike those made during a reissue or reexamination proceeding because an IPR is adjudicative rather than administrative. The Court rejected this argument, invoking Cuozzo Speed Technologies, LLC v. Lee. In Cuozzo, the Supreme Court recognized that an IPR involves the reexamination of a patent. Supreme Court explained that, in some “significant respects, inter partes review is less like a judicial proceeding and more like a specialized agency proceeding.” For example, (1) parties that initiate an IPR need not have a concrete stake in the outcome; (2) a petition is not required to remain in an IPR, and the PTO may continue to conduct an IPR after a petitioner has settled; (3) the PTO can intervene in a later judicial proceeding to defend its decision; and (4) unpatentability in an IPR must be established by a preponderance of the evidence, whereas invalidity in a district court must be established by clear and convincing evidence. Because an IPR proceeding involves reexamination of an earlier administrative grant of a patent, the Court held that statements made by a patent owner during an IPR can be considered during claim construction and relied upon to support a finding of prosecution disclaimer. However, to invoke the doctrine of prosecution disclaimer, any such statements must “be both clear and unmistakable.” Aylus also argued that its statements were not part of an IPR proceeding because they were made in a preliminary response, before the Board issued its institution decision. The Court again disagreed. While an “IPR does not begin until it is instituted,” the differences between the two phases of an IPR are immaterial for purposes of prosecution disclaimer. A patent owner’s preliminary response filed prior to an institution decision and a patent owner’s response filed after institution are both official papers filed with the PTO and made available to the public. In both, the patent owner can define claim terms and make representations about claim scope. Despite when the statements are made, the public is “entitled to rely on those representations when determining a course of lawful conduct, such as launching a new product or designing-around a patented invention.” Therefore, the Court held that statements made by a patent owner during an IPR proceeding, whether before or after an institution decision, can be considered for claim construction and relied upon to support a finding of prosecution disclaimer. Finally, the Court considered whether Aylus’s statements constitute a clear and unmistakable surrender of claim scope. Apple filed two IPR petitions and Aylus filed a preliminary response in each proceeding. Aylus told the PTO that there were “a number of substantial differences between the challenged claims and the asserted references.” Aylus stated that “the challenged claims require selectively invoking the CP logic and/or CPP logic based on whether the MS and/or MR can communicate with the UE [user endpoint device] through the local network” (emphasis added). It explained that “this is a key aspect of the claimed invention, which addresses an important objective, namely: reducing the use of expensive bandwidth (e.g., wide area cellular networks) by implementing a least-cost routing decision about how to negotiate media content delivery that utilizes the less costly local wireless network whenever possible” (emphasis added). Aylus repeated these same statements later in its response when distinguishing the specific prior art references cited in the petition. The Court held that Aylus’s repeated statements that claims 2 and 21 “require that . . . only the control point proxy logic[] be invoked” and that “only ‘the CPP is invoked’” represent an unequivocal and unambiguous disavowal of the CP logic’s invocation. Aylus argued that these statements are not a clear and unmistakable surrender of claim scope because they “can reasonably be interpreted to mean that ‘only’ the CPP logic is required to be invoked in those claims—not that the CP logic is precluded from being invoked.” It further argued that this interpretation is best understood in the context of surrounding statements. The Court explained that it has held that “when a prosecution argument is subject to more than one reasonable interpretation, it cannot rise to the level of a clear and unmistakable disclaimer.” However, it found that Aylus’s interpretation was not reasonable. The surrounding statements did not change the plain meaning of Aylus’s disavowing statements. At oral argument, Aylus even conceded that the plain meaning of these statements suggests that the CP logic cannot be invoked. Therefore, the Court held that Aylus’s statements in the IPR proceeding are a clear and unmistakable surrender of methods invoking the CP logic in claims 2 and 21. Based on this disclaimer, the Court found no error in the district court’s claim construction. Statements made by a patent owner during an IPR can be considered during claim construction and relied upon to support a finding of prosecution disclaimer. No distinction should be made between statements made before or after an institution decision. However, to invoke prosecution disclaimer, the statements must constitute a clear and unmistakable surrender of claim scope. If a prosecution argument is subject to more than one reasonable interpretation, it cannot rise to the level of a clear and unmistakable disclaimer.

The post has since been taken down, but initially included the caption: “How did I end up in the studio with Dr Dre ON THE night his deal went public that he did with Apple 3.2 BILLION!!!!! The BEATS HEADPHONES JUST CHANGED HIP HOP!!!!!!” WATCH: The New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Financial Times reported the story Thursday citing sources briefed on the talks. Beats by Dre headphones‘ annual sales revenues have reportedly gone up to $1.5 billion since the company was founded with music executive Jimmy Iovine began selling headphones in 2008. The deal would include the new Beats Music streaming service, which Apple is likely acquiring to compete with streaming services like Pandora and Spotify after the company’s iTunes Radio failed to impress the industry. Apple’s revenue growth has declined sharply in recent years, and the company only entered the broadly popular streaming market last year — late because of former CEO Steve Jobs’ reported unfavorable opinion of music subscription services. The company continues to be the largest seller of music downloads, but is losing market share to companies like Amazon. Purchasing Beats would mark Apple’s largest acquisition ever. The headphones retail between about $169.95 to $449.95, depending on model and features, and despite many music and sound industry experts describing their quality as “extraordinarily bad,” the brand has become enormously popular as a fashion item among a younger consumer base, and the popular alternative to standard earbuds models. Beats’ success is due in large part to its wide profit margins – despite the steep prices of the popular bass-heavy headphone models, each individual unit reportedly only costs around $14 to produce. Private equity firm Carlyle Group invested $500 million in Beats last year, and valued the company at more than $1 billion. Neither Apple nor Beats would comment on the deal in the original reports, and the briefed sources said they were still in the negotiation stage. Though the companies have yet to consummate the agreement, and it could still fall through, if things go as planned the official announcement could be made as early as next week.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Apple's Taiwan Supply Chain Estimates that Apple will Ship 5 to 6 Million 10.5-inch iPad Pro Tablets this Year | Main | Apple Blames Third Party Batteries as Cause of Apple Headphones blowing up and burning Passenger's Face » May 19, 2017 Apple Officially Signed on TPK for Next-Gen OLED Based 3D Touch Solutions for the iPhone 8   Patently Apple posted a report in March titled "Apple Suppliers GIS and TPK are Building New Capacity to Handle Apple's Next-Gen 3D OLED Touch Panels." This was confirmed in a new report published today by the Chinese-language newspaper Economic Daily News. The news also noted that Apple had accepted TPK's quote of US$18-22 for the new 3D Touch solution to be used in the iPhone 8 shipping in September.   The current 3D Touch solution used in today's iPhone series, TPK and fellow maker General Interface Solution (GIS) quote US$7-9 per smartphone. The solution directly bonds 3D Touch sensors on LTPS TFT-LCD display panels of the iPhone, but 3D Touch solution for OLED panels entails bonding of a glass cover on the front and back side of an OLED panel each to reinforce the fragile OLED panel.   Due to the additional bonding of glass covers, overall processing cost for OLED-based 3D Touch solution is about 50% higher than that for the LCD-based one but the quotes for the client is about 150% higher. Therefore, TPK and GIS are expected to significantly benefit from Apple's orders for OLED-based 3D Touch solution.   TPK has passed certification for OLED-based 3D Touch solution and expects to obtain significant orders.TPK.   In February Patently Apple reported that TPK saw a bright 2017 due to selling their next-gen 3D Touch solution to Apple. The reported noted that "The average price per unit of 3D touch module in the past is around $8 to $9, but the price for the more sophisticated force touch module for this year's new iPhone will rise to some $14 to $15. That would definitely help boost the revenue of suppliers in the second half of this year." Obviously the higher US$18-22 price accepted by Apple today is even higher than expected. Whether the higher cost is to cover currency or production issues is unknown at this time.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

report this ad / Cory Doctorow / 6:17 am Thu May 18, 2017 Apple, CTA and Big Car are working in secret to kill New York's Right to Repair legislation From the Boing Boing Shop See all deals Follow Us Twitter / Facebook / RSS Here's the list of companies that are quietly lobbying to kill New York State's Right to Repair legislation (previously), which would force companies to halt anticompetitive practices that prevent small businesses from offering repair services to their communities: "Apple, Verizon, Toyota, Lexmark, Caterpillar, Asurion, Medtronic" and the Consumer Technology Association "which represents thousands of electronics manufacturers." report this ad The companies are especially opposed to rules that ban using DRM to prevent the use of third-party parts and spares -- it's become common practice to embed just enough software handshaking in replacement parts to invoke section 1201 of the DMCA, which makes it a felony to bypass "effective means of access control" for copyrighted works. A manufacturer who designs their device to use (copyrighted) software to validate spare parts -- something John Deere has become notorious for -- can then invoke the DMCA to make it a felony, punishable by a five-year prison sentence and a $500,000 fine, to make compatible components. Every company lobbying against competitors making compatible products has benefited greatly from their own competitive compatibility products: for example, Apple ran a high-profile, extremely successful marketing campaign (the Switch campaign) that advised potential customers on how to use Apple products to access files created with Microsoft products. It's ironic that many of the Apple customers who cheered on the "Switch" campaign are likely gearing up to hand-wave away the hypocrisy of lobbying to make it literally illegal to switch away from Apple-supplied products, invoking the absurd claim that Apple critics are bitter hipsters who merely resent the company's success. Remember: "the tactic of pointing to other companies that have done bad things when your favorite company is caught in its own misdeeds is the 'But her emails!' of technology fanboyism." Apple and its lobbyists would not discuss their concerns with the bill with Motherboard's Jason Koebler. However, Apple has lobbied against similar legislation in other states, several times, and told a Nebraska law-maker that passing Right to Repair legislation would turn the state into a "Mecca for bad actors." The records show that companies and organizations lobbying against right to repair legislation spent $366,634 to retain lobbyists in the state between January and April of this year. Thus far, the Digital Right to Repair Coalition—which is generally made up of independent repair shops with several employees—is the only organization publicly lobbying for the legislation. It has spent $5,042 on the effort, according to the records. A retainer agreement between Apple and lobbying firm the Roffe Group notes that the law firm will "lobby Apple's corporate issues, including but not limited to areas of environment, tax, and retail." According to the contract, Apple pays Roffe Group $9,000 per month for its services. According to the records, fair repair (New York Senate bill 618A) is one of just three bills Apple lobbied on in March and April. The records—which as far as I can tell have not been published on a news site before—also show that Apple lobbied against similar legislation in 2016 and 2015.

But Todd Gordon of TradingAnalysis.com sees more gains ahead. He pointed to a similar pullback in April that yielded a rally to its current levels. Alex Rosenberg | Rebecca Ungarino 20 Hours AgoCNBC.com SHARES show chapters Trader bets on another bounce for Apple    Thursday, 18 May 2017 | 3:52 PM ET | 03:12 Apple shares have cooled after hitting a record high of $156.65 on Monday, but chart-minded trader Todd Gordon of TradingAnalysis.com sees more gains ahead for the world's largest public company. "We have a very nice uptrend going on in the Apple chart," Gordon said Thursday on CNBC's "Trading Nation." "We have a nice little pullback here it can compare against — a nice little $4 drop, give or take — and we're seeing a similar $4 to $5 drop here in Apple," he said. Specifically, Gordon is referring to a modest pullback in the stock from early to mid-April, in which Apple shares dipped from about $144 per share to about $140 per share. Since mid-April, Apple has come back, rallying more than 7 percent to its current levels. To capitalize on a move higher, Todd is putting on a trade known as a short put spread. He is selling the 152.5-strike put expiring on May 26, while hedging his exposure by buying the 150-strike put expiring on the same date. This trade will offer him a credit of 91 cents per share, or $91 per options spread. So long as Apple stays above $152.50 — which is just about where it closed on Thursday — Gordon will get to keep all of that money. If Apple closes below $151.59 on May 26, the trade will begin to show losses. And if Apple closes at or below $150, the trader will see his maximum loss of $1.59. While the trade technically has an unfavorable risk-to-reward setup, this structure allows for a "margin for error" that will allow him to profit as long as the stock at least stays flat. Gordon added that since options prices on Apple are at elevated levels, selling options, rather than buying them, is a superior way to express one's thesis. To be sure, dips in Apple are rare this year, but have been quite frequent in past years. The stock dipped more than 11 percent from mid-October to mid-November last year and the shares declined for the full year in 2015. But in both cases, the stock eventually rebounded to new highs.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Herman Wong By Herman Wong May 19 at 7:00 AM Follow @hermanywong One of the world’s most avid collectors would love to get his hands on an exclusive Apple product that the company isn’t selling. What Scott Wiener is after is a pizza box. The wider world became aware of the circular carrier with a perforated lid after it was mentioned briefly in a recent Wired article about Apple Park, the Silicon Valley giant’s new campus in Cupertino, Calif. In a parenthetical, the magazine noted that Francesco Longoni, “the maestro of the Apple Park café, helped Apple patent a box that will keep to-go pizzas from getting soggy.” A caption added that it was “for workers who want to take the café’s pizza back to their pods.” The patent describes the container as “a lid portion that is coupled to the base portion through a hinged connection such that the entire container is singularly constructed from a single piece of material.” Or you could just look at this video. @oliviasolon @ComfortablySmug Unboxing video pic.twitter.com/cJ2cqGoKdk — Kyle Kessler (@kylekessler) May 17, 2017 Apple declined to make their Longoni available for comment or answer any questions about their pizza and pizza boxes. So we asked Wiener for his impression, based on photos and the patent filing. Now Wiener does not make pizza boxes. He collects them. A lot of them. He is the Guinness record holder for the world’s largest pizza box collection, with more than 1,300 from dozens of countries in his possession. He sees them as an interesting way to look at pizza. “Any piece of ephemera says so much about the culture — it says something about the food itself.” The 35-year-old New Jersey native is the author of “Viva la Pizza!: The Art of the Pizza Box” and has given talks on the glories of these majestic receptacles at Google. Wiener likes the Apple-patented pizza box, but was hesitant to call it revolutionary. Here’s what he saw as its strengths and weaknesses. The pluses of the Apple pizza box The vents: “You’ve got those ports on the top, which are sort of toward the center and in a circle, and they seem to be located around the point where you have the most moisture build up. Standard pizza boxes have their vents toward their corners. And if you look at a pizza, and you look through those corner slots, you see nothing or you are looking at crust. The moisture’s not coming from there; the moisture is really coming from the tomatoes. If you have it toward the center that’s a really smart idea, that’s cool.” “The ridged bottom is cool because it allows for moisture to escape.” The look: “You walk around with that and it look like you’re from the future.” A step forward: “It’s a step away from paper, it’s a step toward other materials. With paper, when you use a recycled cardboard pizza box, sometimes you do get residue flavor change in the pizza because the steam buildup breaks down some of the paper. And I like the idea of moving away from that and maybe we have something that doesn’t have quite a flavor impact.” (Wiener based this assumption on the patent filing, which said the box is made of a type of fiber.) The minuses The shape: “It means you don’t have a lot of wiggle room if you have a slightly too large pizza. Also, if you stack those circles, it’s not as stable as stacking square boxes. A tower of those rounds — I can see that being an issue and falling over. The squares will just stack better.” (Wiener added that if the customers aren’t going to be stacking them then it won’t be an issue.) Space: “I’m a little concerned about the amount of real estate the packages themselves would take up. If you used it in a standard commercial pizzeria it might be the kind of thing that takes up too much space. If you get normal cardboard pizza boxes at a pizzeria they are called blank because they are just flattened and they are not folded up.” Lack of art: “It is tougher to add in any visual element, artwork.” What would you ask Apple about their pizzas or pizza boxes? He was most interested in how the pizzas are made. “Are they gas oven pizzas, is it a wood-fired thing? What is the oven in their cafeteria.” He is also curious about the material used to make the box.  What are you seeing with pizza boxes today and what are the best? Wiener said has seen growing interest in environmentally friendly pizza boxes that take up less space in the garbage can, and those that are easily recyclable or compostable. He also noted a trend in boxes with a secondary use, such as a built in game or that turns into its own container for leftovers.  A few years ago he named VENTiT the world’s best designed pizza box, praising it for retaining heat without trapping steam. This is the world’s best-designed pizza box http://t.co/YJc2Sy0Zjp pic.twitter.com/eIN9qYaXoR — Quartz (@qz) January 24, 2014 Some of Wiener’s current favorites are Zume Pizza’s moisture absorbent pizza pod (the lid soaks up to five grams of water vapor, according to Fast Company), and GreenBox‘s versatility container (the lid becomes plates and the base can be used to carry leftovers).   So, do you want an Apple pizza box? “Of course.” Scott Wiener is the Guinness World Record holder for the largest collection of pizza boxes.

Representational Image. (Source: Bloomberg) Some people think Google’s virtual assistant beats Siri in reliability and capability. That may be true on Google’s own devices, like the Pixel smartphone, but the Assistant is hobbled on the iPhone. During the keynote at the Google I/O conference this week, the internet giant unveiled a version of its Assistant as an app for the iPhone. It has a slick design, integrates the company’s ubiquitous search engine, and taps into Google services like Gmail and Google Calendar. The crowd of developers in the audience cheered: millions of new iPhone users to reach for innovative voice-based interactions. But the reality for iPhone users is that the Google Assistant will probably never beat Apple Inc.’s Siri on its home turf. That’s bad news for the Alphabet Inc. unit, which wants its voice-based technology everywhere. Here are some of the limitations: You have to download it from the App Store. While Siri is fully baked into the iPhone from the first time you turn it on, the only way to get Google Assistant on your iPhone is to download it from Apple’s App Store. This may seem obvious as it is a third-party program, but the process of finding the app, installing it, and placing it in an ideal spot on your home screen is significant friction that will likely limit adoption and usage. On Google’s Pixel phone, there are none of these potential road blocks. You can’t launch it with your iPhone’s home button or with your voice. To launch Siri on your iPhone, you just click the home button for a couple of seconds. You can also say “Hey, Siri” if you have more recent hardware. Also read: Google I/O 2017: Daydream 2.0 ‘Euphrates’ adds screen-casting, Chrome support With the Google Assistant app, you have to either use a shortcut in the widget panel left of the iPhone’s first home screen or find the app icon. You also can’t launch the app by saying “OK, Google,” but you can use the phrase if you already have the app open. This relatively small inconvenience can be a deal breaker as one of the selling points of a comprehensive voice assistant is to avoid tapping and switching between different apps. You can’t tap into basic iPhone functions and settings. Siri is one of the quickest ways to turn on Airplane Mode, or Do Not Disturb, or create alarms. Google Assistant on the iPhone can’t integrate deeply enough into Apple’s iOS operating system to pull off those actions. It does let you input calendar appointments, set timers, jot down shopping lists, look up contacts, and get reminders, but all of that functionality works only with Google’s own services. If you’re in the iCloud ecosystem — using built-in core mobile features like Apple’s calendar or contacts — you’ll probably stick with Siri.

One of the most handy Siri features is the ability to search for App Store apps, iTunes movies, and photo albums with your voice. Google Assistant can’t tap into those features, although you can search for Apple Music songs and it will send you to that app. Similarly, you can’t ask Google to launch Apple apps on your iPhone, like the calculator or a sports news app, but you can launch many Google-made apps that are installed on the iPhone. You can’t integrate with other non-Google apps on your iPhone. You can’t integrate with other non-Google apps on your iPhone. Siri sends you seamlessly into Uber or Lyft apps to order a ride, send a text message via WhatsApp, or post to Twitter. With Google Assistant on the iPhone, the extent of most app integration ends at Google services like YouTube and Gmail. (Google says Apple Music is again an exception). Google has chat bots (called Actions on Google) for various news, productivity and travel services, but there are limitations since the system is not tapping into actual apps on the iPhone. Google says deeper third-party app integration is coming. Integrated Apple services typically require an extra step. While many Apple apps and services don’t play nicely with Google Assistant, some do work. Namely, text messaging, and making phone calls. However, texts and calls require an extra step. Asking Siri to send a message, or call a colleague puts Apple’s assistant to work instantly. Google’s Assistant requires tapping an extra button to confirm those actions. You can’t easily use it in the car. Siri is deeply integrated into your car’s Bluetooth system. Users can either hold down the iPhone home button, hit an assigned key on a steering wheel, or say the Siri voice command. Google Assistant on iPhones doesn’t have this level of integration, making it a non-starter in the car. Altogether, unless you are deeply in the Google ecosystem, using Google Assistant on the iPhone is a pain compared to Siri. Of course, over time, it is possible that Apple will open up more functionality to the Google Assistant. For now, however, Google Assistant on the iPhone does have one or two advantages over Siri, even for those in the Apple apps and services world. You can type into the Assistant. This is great for situations where you want to quickly get a task done without speaking out loud. And if you have a Google Home speaker, the Assistant on the iPhone integrates well with that device for controlling other connected home gadgets.

The 10.5-inch iPad Pro began mass production in March-April. The new smaller 10.5" iPad Pro will be launching at Apple's WWDC event next month.   As for Apple's recently launched inexpensive 9.7-inch iPad, demand for the tablet is expected to pick up strongly starting the end of the second quarter and will reach the peak in the third quarter, increasing the device's monthly shipments to over four million units in June and July, the market watchers noted.   Apple is also rumored to upgrade its 12.9-inch iPad Pro for 2017, but the product's mass production schedule is still not clear so far. Some market watchers expect the mass production will begin in June with stable shipments in the third quarter.   Sources from the upstream supply chain noted that Apple's inexpensive 9.7-inch iPad is expected to accelerate Apple's pace on phasing out the iPad mini 4 from the market.   Patently Apple reported yesterday that Samsung's tablet shipments overtook the iPad in Europe in Q1 but that the iPad caputured 50% of tablets over $750.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

X Ireland ‘taking too long’ to collect Apple tax and may face court €13 billion must be recovered from Apple despite ongoing Irish appeal about 22 hours ago Updated: about 21 hours ago Peter Hamilton EU competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager. Photograph: EPA         The European Commission expects the State to make “material progress to implement recovery” of Apple taxes as soon as possible or it could risk being referred to EU courts. A spokesman for the commission said: “If member states fail to meet their obligation, the commission may decide to refer them to the EU courts for failure to implement a state aid decision, in line with the EU Treaty.” Irish officials remain in regular contact with the commission and Apple as the State works to ensure that it complies with its tax recovery obligations, a spokeswoman for the Department of Finance said. This response comes after the EU’s competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, told CNBC that Irish authorities are taking too long to recover unpaid taxes from Apple and she hopes Ireland will recover the money “very soon”. Ireland may have to sacrifice sacred cows to survive Brexit Luxembourg to support Irish appeal over Apple tax ruling EU Commission ‘exceeded its powers’ in Apple tax case Last August the European Commission ruled that Ireland had granted illegal state aid to Apple and therefore had to collect roughly €13 billion in taxes plus EU interest. The Government has lodged an application in the General Court of the European Union in appeal of the commission’s decision. Formal deadline Commenting on the requirement to recover the taxes, the Department of Finance spokeswomen added: “Despite this appeal, Ireland is required to comply with the binding articles of the commission’s final decision and ensure that the alleged aid is recovered from Apple.” “Although the formal deadline has now passed, it is not unusual or uncommon for member states to require more time for recovery,” she said. However, the commission spokesman said Ireland “must demonstrate progress on recovery and a coherent strategy to enforce the decision within the set deadline.” He also noted that “the commission is always ready to support the member state in the recovery process and gives consideration to the fact that recovery in certain cases may be more complex than in others, and thus may require some more time.” The original deadline for Ireland to implement the commission’s decision of last August was January 3rd.       Topics: Margrethe Vestager Department of Finance European Commission European Union Irish Government Apple Cnbc Ireland  Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Economy EU/ECB criticise Government use of windfall to raise public spending Work Older colleagues can offer emotional intelligence for your digital intelligence Pro12 Home comforts to help Munster clip Ospreys’ wings Innovation OrderPoint aims to cut waste bills for hospitality industry Sponsored Life through a lens: Samsung S8 brings photography to next level The Story of Home: A Kerry mountain retreat Truth serum: how serums won a place in our beauty regimes The Story of Home: A dream of tiny houses Latest Business Time is right to cash in some of State’s AIB shareholding 06:56 Watsa says he saved Bank of Ireland because of Boucher 06:41 Straight talking at Clontarf 06:36 Taoiseach’s pension package would cost €5m to buy - experts 01:00 Niall Quinn’s Q-Sat switched off over dispute with British provider 20:00 How to?

Since then, Rogue Amoeba has been working on two fronts to restore streaming to the Apple TV. The first results of those efforts were seen last month when Rogue Amoeba released a tvOS app called Airfoil Satellite TV that restored streaming as long as the app was running on your Apple TV. Today, Rogue Amoeba announced that it has restored full Apple TV streaming functionality to Airfoil for macOS. We’ve got a great update for Airfoil for Mac today which enables it to once again send audio directly to all versions of the Apple TV. Airfoil for Mac 5.6 is a free update, available immediately by selecting “Check for Update” from the Airfoil menu. We strongly encourage all users to move up to Airfoil 5.6 immediately. With the Airfoil update, Airfoil Satellite TV is no longer necessary to stream to the Apple TV, but Rogue Amoeba plans to maintain it as a fall-back in case future tvOS updates break Airfoil streaming again.

 Evidence is mounting that Apple is working on a glucose-monitoring device Sam Shead May 19, 2017, 5:11 AM 3,247 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple CEO Tim Cook and model Christy Turlington at the Apple Watch launch event.REUTERS/Robert Galbraith Apple CEO Tim Cook has been seen testing a glucose monitoring device, according to a CNBC report that fuels speculation Apple is working on its own glucose monitoring technology. Cook was spotted using a glucose monitor at the new Apple Campus in Cupertino, according to a CNBC source. Sadly there are no photos but the source reportedly said that the glucose monitor was physically attached to Cook's Apple Watch in some way. Last month, CNBC reported that Apple has a 30-person team in Palo Alto quietly working on non-invasive and continuous glucose monitoring — something that would be welcomed by the millions of diabetes sufferers worldwide who currently have to draw blood to get a glucose reading. It's likely that any non-invasive glucose monitoring hardware would comprise of one or more sensors that could be built into a product like the Apple Watch or even sit as a standalone device. However, the Apple Watch seems like the most likely candidate at this stage. Earlier this week, tech website BGR published a report that said Apple will introduce a "game-changing glucose monitoring feature in an upcoming Apple Watch," citing a source familiar with the matter. In February, Cook spoke about his personal interest in glucose monitors as he collected an honorary degree from the University of Glasgow. "I've been wearing a continuous glucose monitor for a few weeks," he said at the time. "I just took it off before coming on this trip." Unfortunately, Cook did not specify whether the device he had been wearing was an Apple prototype or a device created by another manufacturer but he did say that glucose monitor had enabled him to monitor his blood sugar levels and adjust his diet accordingly Apple's plans in the space could be quite far along. Indeed, the iPhone maker is already conducting feasibility trials for a glucose monitoring device in the San Francisco Bay Area, according to CNBC sources. Apple does not typically comment on rumours such as this one. NOW WATCH: The newest flying car is backed by Larry Page — and you can buy it by the end of the year Loading video...

International Business Times UK UK World Business Politics Fintech Technology Science Sport Entertainment Opinion Video Pictures Log out Newsletter Signup Smartphones Cybersecurity Innovation Social Media Games Motoring Technology Wearables Tim Cook is testing an Apple Watch prototype to fight diabetes Future Apple Watch could continuously track blood sugar levels without breaking the skin. By Alistair Charlton May 19, 2017 11:00 BST Apple boss Tim Cook says he has been wearing a device providing real-time blood sugar readingsReuters Apple boss Tim Cook has been wearing a new blood sugar tracking device connected to his Apple Watch, company insiders claim. The indication that a new Apple product is on the way comes after Cook told University of Glasgow students in February that he had recently been wearing a continuous glucose tracker. Apple is said to be working on a wearable device which constantly records blood sugar levels, but in a non-invasive way. Current trackers use tiny sensors which penetrate the skin to get a reading, but it is hoped that Apple's solution will negate the need for this. Cook told the students in February how the device alerted him to changes in blood sugar levels in real time, helping him adjust his food intake during each day. It isn't yet clear if the device will be embedded into a future version of the Apple Watch, or if the finished product will be designed to be worn separately. For now, sources speaking to CNBC say the prototype used by Cook was connected to his watch. A source said the device would become a "must-have" for millions of diabetes sufferers the world over. The Watch currently tracks the wearer's heart rate and movement, but it is no secret that Apple wants to take larger steps into the medical technology industry. It was reported in April that Apple has a team in Palo Alto, close to its Cupertino, California headquarters, working on the "holy grail" for diabetes, a device offering non-invasive and continuous glucose monitoring. It is claimed that Apple is currently conducting feasibility tests for the medical gadget in the San Francisco Bay Area. Speaking in February, Cook said: "It's mentally anguishing to stick yourself many times a day to check your blood sugar. There is lots of hope out there that if someone has constant knowledge of what they're eating, they can instantly know what causes the response...and that they can adjust well before they become diabetic."

There have been many rumors about Apple increasing the price of the model above the current iPhone range (128 GB iPhone 7 Plus tops out at $969), with some people referring to the device as an ‘iPhone Pro’. Higher component costs support the idea of a premium price tag, and this is exactly what Economic Daily News is reporting today. It claims that the 3D Touch module in the OLED iPhone will cost Apple 150% more than the equivalent parts in the LCD iPhone 7 … Try Amazon Prime 30-Day Free Trial 3D Touch was first introduced with iPhone 6s, with headline features including home screen app shortcuts and Peek and Pop previews. The report says that touch panel manufacturer TPK currently charges $7-9 per iPhone sold to enable 3D Touch in the current iPhone series. For the upcoming OLED iPhone (tentatively named iPhone 8 by the community), the component cost for 3D Touch will more than double. EDN says that TPK has quoted Apple a cost between $18-$22 per device. Apple has seemingly accepted this quote as the next-generation iPhone production ramp is underway. Pressure-sensitive displays are more complex when the underlying screen technology is OLED (compared to LCD) because the OLED panel is more fragile. This necessitates the addition of a bonded glass cover on the front and back of the OLED panel. Digitimes says that usually an OLED-based 3D Touch solution will cost about 50% more than the LCD solution to account for the additional steps. However, Apple’s orders have been agreed at a quote that is 150% higher. It is not clear why Apple is paying top dollar for its components compared to the industry average. Speculatively, the iPhone 8 may include some cutting-edge display feature (Touch ID in the screen?) that requires additional care and processing. Apple analyst KGI’s Ming-Chi Kuo has previously reported the need for a new intricate 3D Touch module for iPhone 8. Whatever the reason, a cost increase from $9 to $22 per unit is a significant increase in Apple’s bill of materials. Any increase in component cost will generally imply an increase in the final price of the product as Apple will want to maintain its margins. Therefore, this report supports the idea of the new iPhone 8 having a significantly higher price tag. A JP Morgan analyst previously predicted total BOM cost for the iPhone 8 will be about $90 more than the current phones. Apple is expected to debut the premium OLED iPhone later this year, touting wireless charging, 3D-sensing front cameras, face recognition and more features in addition to the new design. It is has also been reported that the company will unveil two iterative updates to the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus which will include new internal upgrades but look mostly the same from the outside. These ‘7s’ devices would retain current price points giving room for Apple to make the iPhone 8 more expensive.

Digital Trends Home > Apple > Apple Watch 3: News and rumors Apple Watch 3: News and rumors Tim Cook may be testing the Apple Watch 3's glucose monitor himself By Christian de Looper — Updated May 18, 2017 2:45 pm Share Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: The Apple Watch is the best-selling smartwatch ever released, and it’s certainly a great product, but there’s always room for improvement. While the Apple Watch Series 2 did alter the Series 1 for the better in a few key areas, it’s the rumored Apple Watch Series 3 that may offer what we really want to see. But what exactly will the release of the Apple Watch Series 3 bring? The device is shaping up to be quite an interesting one. Here’s everything we know about it so far. Sensors Rumor has it that Apple may be stepping up the health tracking capabilities on the Apple Watch for Series 3. According to a report from BGR, the new Apple Watch may be able to monitor blood glucose levels, and new reports indicate that Apple CEO Tim Cook is testing the new accessory personally. Cook has reportedly been spotted on the Apple campus wearing a prototype device, and while it’s currently unclear if the device is Apple-built or built in partnership with a medical company, reports from CNBC suggest that it’s the blood glucose monitor. Apple has reportedly been interested in helping tackle diabetes for some time now, and the glucose monitoring feature could be a game-changer for diabetics. Around 30 million people in the U.S. alone suffer from diabetes. Currently, the only way to monitor blood glucose is to get a blood sample. According to the report, the Apple Watch’s glucose monitoring will be noninvasive. Smart bands Apple may introduce a whole slew of new functionality with the Apple Watch Series 3 through a series of interchangeable “smart bands,” which will add different functions to the Apple Watch quickly and easily. That will give the Apple Watch a modular design, and allow users to add features without having to pay more for the Apple Watch outright. It’s possible that the glucose monitoring system will be introduced as a smart band rather than as core functionality to the Apple Watch itself. A SIM card and LTE The Apple Watch Series 3 may be the first in Apple’s portfolio to support LTE connectivity, although rumors about such a feature have spread since the very first version, indicating it’s something Apple often experiments with ahead of launch. At the end of March 2017, an analyst from Susquehanna Financial Group published findings from a data-gathering trip to Asia, and claimed, “several parties” said the new Apple Watch would have a SIM card slot and support LTE connectivity. The analyst met with Qualcomm and Broadcom, among others, during his trip. Additionally, Apple may be investigating a low-power LTE chip for use in the Apple Watch 3 to ensure battery life doesn’t suffer. This fits in with a previous Bloomberg report, which stated company engineers weren’t able to finalize a cellular design for the Apple Watch without compromising battery, and was reportedly invested in “low-power cellular data chips.” The addition of LTE would make phone calls possible directly from the Apple Watch, and the Susquehanna analyst says Apple will push its wireless AirPods as the ideal companion product for the job. Display The Apple Watch Series 3 won’t use the same touch panels as its predecessors. According to DigiTimes, Apple will source glass-film capacitive glass from Biel Crystal or General Interface Solutions. The reason: Apple is reportedly unhappy with the yields of its current glass manufacturer, TPK. The firm has been unable to produce the Apple Watch’s particular brand of glass at scale, reportedly because of the smartwatch’s curved surface. Moreover, a new report suggests that Apple will not be using OLED in the Apple Watch Series 3. Rather, it will be employing a new display technology called micro-LED. Back in 2014, Apple acquired LuxVue, a company that specializes in the technology, and now it appears the iEmpire is leveraging this company to bring micro-LED screens to market. It would certainly make sense for Apple to begin testing out micro-LED tech in its smaller hardware, like the Apple Watch. After all, as Apple Insider points out, producing these panels is quite difficult, and as such, it’s likely not yet ready for application on say, the newest iPhone. That said, the smaller screen of Apple’s wearable makes it an ideal first candidate. Battery A report from DigiTimes, meanwhile, mentions two key improvements to the Apple Watch Series 3 — performance and battery life. The Apple Watch has never been a high performer and it has always suffered from battery life issues, so improvements in those areas will certainly be welcome changes. Still, the Apple Watch Series 2 battery can generally last for around 2 or more days — so if Apple is seriously focusing on battery life for the Series 3, it’s possible that it’s also introducing new features that could put a bigger drain on the battery. Design Many are hoping that the Apple Watch Series 3 will bring with it a major redesign, however if recent reports are anything to go by, unfortunately this may not be the year we see that happen. According to a report from DigiTimes, which sources Chinese publication Economic Daily News, the overall design of the third Apple Watch will remain the same, despite the fact that it will include a few new key features. What that means is that those hoping for a round Apple Watch may have to wait a little longer, if one is ever released at all. While round smartwatches have become quite a trend in the Android Wear market, the Apple Watch has stuck with a four-cornered form factor. Release date So when will we get the new Apple Watch? The report from DigiTimes suggests it will land at some point in the third quarter of this year, meaning that Apple could be shifting to a yearly upgrade cycle for the Apple Watch. We’ll keep this post updated as we learn more about the Apple Watch Series 3. Article originally published in January 2017.

Digital Trends Home > Cars > Any car can rock Android Auto or CarPlay with… Any car can rock Android Auto or CarPlay with Pioneer’s latest in-dash receivers By Caleb Denison — Updated May 19, 2017 9:31 am Subscribe Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you With the increasing availability of aftermarket receivers, you don't need a new car with the latest tech to maintain connectivity with your mobile devices. Pioneer has announced five new in-dash receivers starting at unprecedentedly low prices, making Apple’s CarPlay and Android Auto attainable for a wider array of car owners. The entry-level $400 deck sports CarPlay and upgraded sound, as well as a new single-DIN option for those with classic cars and exotic sports cars. Now virtually any driver who needs to stay connected to their smartphones can do so safely and, more importantly, legally. 15 states in the U.S. currently consider it illegal to so much as touch a smartphone while driving, and 37 states will ban teen drivers from using their smartphones while behind the wheel. And with more widespread legislation on the way, Apple’s CarPlay and Android Auto are becoming increasingly valuable tools for staying connected while on the road. Until now, unless you purchased a new car with one or both of the technologies already built into the dash, expensive aftermarket in-dash receivers were the only way to retrofit a vehicle into the modern age of smartphone connectivity. Pioneer changed that today with the introduction of the AVH-1330NEX and AVH-1300NEX receivers at $400, along with the step-up AVH-2330NEX and AVH-2300NEX at $500, and the all-new single-DIN AVH-3300NEX with pop-out touchscreen for $600 Pioneer AVH-1330NEX Pioneer AVH-2330NEX Pioneer AVH-4201NEX Pioneer AVH-2330NEX The AVH-1300NEX with CarPlay only and the AVH-1330NEX with both CarPlay and Android auto are currently the least expensive way to put the two most popular smartphone platforms right into a car’s dashboard. Drivers can use CarPlay to make and receive phone calls, compose and respond to text messages, and access Apple maps for navigation, all using voice control with Siri. You can also access Apple Music, iTunes Radio, Spotify, Pandora, and SiriusXM satellite radio for music playback. Android Auto provides access to Google Maps, Google Play Music, and all the aforementioned music apps as well, with the promise of direct Waze access coming in the near future. For those who wish to use Waze now, Pioneer makes the popular traffic-based maps app available through its Apps+ feature, putting the app right up on the touchscreen for easy viewing and integrated audio directional instructions. All of these new receivers will also let drivers create new Pandora stations on the spot based on the song being played, and store up to six stations as presets, much like standard FM Radio. All decks also play CDs and DVDs, and support high-res FLAC file playback up encoded at up to 192kHz/24-bit, though resolution will be scaled down to CD quality. While the cheaper receivers sport a 6.2-inch display, the step-up AVH-2300NEX and AVH-2330NEX, at $500 each, offer a larger 7-inch display. All this is still packed into a standard double-DIN slot. Sleeker controls and smaller bezels on these receivers also make for a slightly more attractive option. Finally, the AVH-3300NEX makes a single-DIN installation for those with older cars, classic cars, sports cars and exotic cars a possibility, thanks to a flip-out 7-inch touchscreen. This model, along with the 2330 and 1330, also supports dual cameras, while the rest of the line supports a single back-up camera with boundary lines overlaid on the image. Pioneer AVH-3300NEX Drivers will also enjoy an upgrade in sound quality in most cases thanks to Pioneer’s 50-watt X 4 built-in amplifiers, graphic EQ, and fine-tuned balance and fade controls. For those concerned about replacing the existing system in their car due to its heavy integration with such features as environmental controls and on-screen instrument clusters, Pioneer offers support for a system called iDatalink Maestro, which allows all those features to be uploaded to the new in-dash receivers and displayed on the touchscreen at the touch of a tab. In many cases, this upgrade will allow even more interaction with vehicle controls and informational displays than what was available on the stock display. Pioneer told Digital Trends the new receivers will be available for purchase July 2017.

Around 1,500 developers, mainly twentysomething males, have been tasked with increasing user engagement through new ‘mini-programs’ on WeChat that look and operate much like apps on Apple Inc’s iOS and Google’s Android operating systems - but are far less data-intensive. WeChat, owned by Tencent Holdings, says it’s not a direct challenge to the dominant mobile platforms, but some analysts and developers say the new business could eat into that of iOS and Android app ecosystems. “In the long-term, the relationship between Tencent and Apple’s ecosystems will be co-existence and ‘co-opetition’ - intense competition in some areas and time periods, coupled with some form of cooperation in others,” said Su Ning, professor of Information Systems at Ivey Business School in Canada. With more than 938 million users, WeChat, known as Weixin in China, already serves as a one-stop-shop for everything from reading news and booking taxis to ordering takeaways and making payments. Half the users spend more than 90 minutes a day on its chat app, according to WeChat. WeChat’s push on these nimble mini-apps comes as Google this week launched its own Android Instant Apps, which don’t require downloading and are available on certain Android devices, though access to Google products in China is heavily restricted. WeChat says there are about 200,000 third-party developers for the WeChat platform. “A very strong trend in China is that demand for iOS and Android apps is waning, while that for program developing based on WeChat is rising,” said Leon Du, co-founder of Guangzhou-based Beansmile, a digital consultancy that develops apps and websites. Helped by WeChat-based advertising and payment-related services, Tencent this week reported its highest profit growth in three years for the first quarter. While Tencent doesn’t release data on the number of mini-programs available, Dong Xu, a manager at market data firm Analysys, says her interviews with businesses suggest the adoption rate has so far been modest. “Mini-programs are mainly used for low-frequency, offline scenarios, such as fee payments, parking, and customer inquiries,” Dong said. “Users’ in-depth needs such as entertainment and e-commerce still take place with apps.” Third-party developers say the mini-programs, built in WeChat’s proprietary programming language, are less data-heavy and easier to develop than their iOS or Android counterparts. Users, for example, can tap a program on a restaurant’s official WeChat account to order food, have it delivered to their table and pay for it, all in one app. WeChat also last month quietly established a new department dedicated to online searching, and this week rolled out a beta search-engine box with enhanced power, revealing its ambition to take on rival Baidu Inc. PAY WARS Central to its plans for an expansive and dynamic app ecosystem is the development of WeChat’s own payment infrastructure. Around 300 developers work for WeChat Pay, which competes with Alipay, run by Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial, and to a lesser extent, Apple Pay, which launched in China last year. TenPay, which runs WeChat Pay and Tencent’s smaller QQ Wallet, is China’s most popular mobile payment provider by users, with 838 million users dwarfing Alipay’s 432 million, according to Analysys. At a post-earnings conference call on Wednesday, Tencent President Martin Lau flagged WeChat Pay’s goal to permeate all aspects of consumer life in China. For Apple, which wants to deepen its reach in China, the world’s biggest mobile spender, WeChat’s large and loyal fan base and its payment service present a challenge. China overtook the United States as the biggest contributor to Apple’s iOS app store revenue last year, according to mobile data analytics firm App Annie. However, Apple’s Greater China revenue dropped 14% in the first three months of the year, as cheaper rivals chipped away at sales. Apple declined to comment for this article. Last month, some Chinese WeChat fans threatened to ditch Apple products after the U.S. firm forced the chat app to abolish a popular tipping function. While building user loyalty is a core part of both Apple’s and WeChat’s strategies, Zhang Ying, general manager of WeChat Pay, has downplayed product tensions from the tipping spat. “Apple is still supportive of the [WeChat] ecosystem. We are part of the [Apple] ecosystem,” he told a forum in Hong Kong last month. “It is far from a ‘choose-one-or-another’ - it’s merely some disagreement.” more from tech Was Twitter down?

The red iPhone 7 will go on sale in Australia on March 25. Local Business Apple fans were jolted out of bed this morning when the tech giant dropped a crimson-shade filter over the technology world with the unexpected announcement of iPhone, iPad, app and accessory releases. Available in both 128GB and 256GB configurations, the special edition iPhone 7 (RED) is basically the same iPhone 7 but with a striking new red skin and an altruistic bent, with each purchase helping support HIV/AIDS prevention and research. The iPhone 7 with a 4.7-inch display will retail from $1229, while the iPhone 7 Plus with a 5.5-inches of screen starts from $1419. The iPad range has been consolidated, with an iPad Mini (4), a 9.7-inch iPad or iPad pro versions at 9.7- or 12.9-inches now on offer. The mid-spec new model is similar in size to the original iPad air but carries a more accessible price point of $469 for 32GB, or $599 for 128GB. The less-frills iPhone SE line is replacing the 16GB and 64GB with 32GB and 128GB options, while maintaining its starting price of $679. Other announcements include new Apple Watch bands in various guises and brands, as well as iPhone 7 cases. Breaking with their regular product announcement protocol, Apple quietly dropped the news on its website and spoke to only a handful of media outlets. Orders will start being accepted at 2.01am AEDT on Saturday. smh.com.au Local Business Latest News Lovedale Long Lunch 2017 | Your photos Saints steamroll Tigers in second half | Photos Hills and The George poised for another epic Rain clears for Maitland junior netball | Photos Taxi basher loses appeal Editor's Picks Airshow to honour pilot Gerard Beiboer | PHOTOS, VIDEO FLASHBACK: Woolworths bombing 1980 | PHOTOS The Elf on the Shelf is back | PHOTOS Popular Is Max the solution?
