If you want to tune into the event to see everything Apple brings to the table, then this post will have all the information you‚Äôll need to learn how to stream the event live. Streaming requirements Just like every other time Apple live streams one its keynotes online, you have to meet certain requirements to watch live. Those are: Any iOS 7.0 or later iPhone, iPod touch, or iPad and viewed with the Safari web browser Any Mac running OS X 10.8.5 or later and viewed with the Safari 6.0.5 or later web browser Any PC running Windows 10 and viewed with the Microsoft Edge web browser Any Apple TV running software 6.2 or later, or the Apple TV 4 with any version of tvOS How to stream from iOS or macOS Apple always makes it the easiest for its loyal customers for tune in. If you‚Äôre using an iOS device or a Mac to live stream this event, all you need to do is visit the Apple Events web page in your Safari web browser. It will begin at 10:00 A.M. PDT on Thursday, so you‚Äôll want to load the website around this time to play the live stream. The video should load automatically; if not, you can refresh the page. If you‚Äôre there a little early, no biggie, it will load when the time comes. If you are a little late, well sorry pal, you might have missed some of it. How to stream from your Apple TV If you have an Apple TV, you can stream from the comfort of your own living room couch, but the process is different depending on the model you have. If you‚Äôre using an Apple TV 3rd generation or older, the event icon will appear on your Home screen automatically and you can select it with your remote to play it at 10:00 A.M. PDT on Thursday. If you‚Äôre using the newer 4th generation Apple TV, you will need to download the free Apple Events app from the App Store, if you don‚Äôt already have it, and use it to stream the event. The video stream will start automatically by 10:00 A.M. PDT. How to stream from a Windows PC If you‚Äôre using a Windows PC, you can also tune in to watch the live stream. The process is different depending on the version of Windows you have installed. Windows 10 users can simply launch the Edge web browser and visit the Apple Events web page. After doing so, the live stream will begin automatically at 10:00 A.M. PDT on Thursday. Those running Windows 8.1 and earlier can use the VLC media player app. After installing it, if you don‚Äôt already have it, you can follow these steps: 1) Launch VLC Media Player and open the app‚Äôs menu. 2) Go into the streaming preferences and use the following streaming URL: High Resolution http://appleliveevents-i.akamaihd.net/hls/live/222436/16oibfvohbfvoihbdfvoihbefv10/master/4500/4500.m3u8 Low Resolution http://appleliveevents-i.akamaihd.net/hls/live/222436/16oibfvohbfvoihbdfvoihbefv10/master/1800/1800.m3u8 3) Click the Play button at 10:00 A.M. PDT to watch the stream via the VLC app. How to stream from an Android device Even if you are using an Android device, whether it‚Äôs a smartphone or a tablet, you can stream the Apple event live. To do so, you should use the VLC app, similarly to the Windows steps above. 1) Launch the app from your Home screen and tap on the Menu button, then tap Stream. 2) After you‚Äôre asked for a streaming source, enter the following URL: High Resolution http://appleliveevents-i.akamaihd.net/hls/live/222436/16oibfvohbfvoihbdfvoihbefv10/master/4500/4500.m3u8 Low Resolution http://appleliveevents-i.akamaihd.net/hls/live/222436/16oibfvohbfvoihbdfvoihbefv10/master/1800/1800.m3u8 3) Tap on the Play button after 10:00 A.M. PDT and the live stream will be playing via the VLC app. Different time zone?

JST What to expect Tons of emphasis has been put on an upgraded lineup of MacBook Pro computers with an OLED touch bar and Touch ID integration, as well as refreshed MacBook Airs, and updated iMacs. Not much is currently known about the specs of these machines just yet, but Apple is expected to continue using Intel chipsets in their systems for this generation rather than moving to the ARM platform. New higher-resolution displays are also possible and USB-C is expected to play a big part in Apple‚Äôs newer notebooks. Whatever Apple decides to do at this event is still up in the air and we won‚Äôt know for sure until it‚Äôs over, but you can stay tuned to iDB for the latest!

Well fret no more. Not only were your worries misplaced to start with, the Apple Watch Nike+ is here to add even more running smarts to the techy timepiece's solid foundations. Just because it's a run-friendly fitness specialist doesn't mean this is some rough, tough uggo of a smartwatch. Oh no. Instead, the Apple Watch Nike+, which will set you back ¬£369 or ¬£399 depending on size, takes everything that's brilliant about Apple's latest wearable and gives it an exercise-tracking polish. The changes are largely cosmetic, sure, but for fitness fans there's enough to transform the Apple Watch from a generic smartwatch into one that's good enough for daily use and serious training runs alike. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Is this enough to give it the edge over both generic smartwatches and dedicated run trackers though? We put it to the test to find out. The Good: Stunning design Brilliant battery life Perfect balance of fitness and general use The Bad: We'd like the Nike makeover to run deeper Strap already showing a bit of wear When can we get a round one? Apple Watch Nike+ Design: Classic Apple gets some fitness finesse ¬©¬† Digital Spy Related: Best Apple Watch straps Seen an Apple Watch before? Then the Nike+ model is going to look pretty familiar, on the surface at least. That's because, bar from a tiny Nike swoosh logo on the underside, it's identical to Apple's standard wearable effort. It even boasts the same swim-friendly waterproof skills that let you submerse it up to 50 metres without worry. Available in both black and silver aluminium forms, there's two physical buttons on the side, including the innovative Digital Crown, an optical heart rate sensor on the back, and the same square form as past models. OK, so square isn't anyone's first choice of watch shape, and we'd still love to see a round model, but there's no escaping how good this thing looks. ¬©¬† Digital Spy Yes, at 11.4mm thick, it's a little plumper than a traditional timepiece but skinnier than most smartwatches. It's also a damn site more svelte than the majority of beefy dedicated running watches. Just because the body is the same doesn't mean this wearable is a complete design doppleganger though. It's got a couple of cool design elements all of its own, most notably its strap. Exclusive to this special edition watch, the sweat-friendly, water-unworried band is crafted from the same synthetic rubber as the traditional Apple Watch Sports Band. There's just a few more holes. Why? Well, as well as allowing for a more secure, personal fit, this helps improve ventilation. Wearing it on runs, our wrist was noticeably less sweaty than when running with our traditional Apple Watch, which is a bonus. The two-tone colour schemes of these straps also make the watch look seriously damn cool. ¬©¬† Digital Spy There is a slight downside though. After just a week's use, the strap is starting to show a little bit of wear. Nothing damaging, but the spare bit of strap that tucks under the buckle is already showing a bit of shine where it's rubbed smooth and been pressed against those holes. This isn't visible during daily use, but it does have us a little worried as to how the strap will wear further down the line. Fortunately you're not restricted to your day one strap choice. Even with four Nike+ options to pick from (black/volt, black/grey, flat silver/white, flat silver/volt), all models play nice with the vast array of compatible Apple Watch bands. Want to posh your watch up for a special occasion? Fine. Just switch the strap out, swipe across to a less sports-centric watch face and... well that's it. You've got a completely new looking device. As it is, the watch is still smart enough to go from the running track to a night out, via a business meeting, without looking out of place.

Based around the Apple Watch 2, it packs all the same smarts as its sibling. There's no need to grumble about the lack of updates and innovation though. The Apple Watch 2 is just a matter of weeks old itself and still the best smartwatch money can buy. Available in both 38mm and 42mm guises, the Apple Watch Nike+ packs plenty of punch from the off, and we're not just talking about the S2 chip that keeps everything running smoothly. Elsewhere, the screen is simply stunning. Increased brightness and a wider colour range over the original Apple Watch really make it pop. It might be small, but it's beautifully sharp with every bit of detail visible whether you're reading messages in a dark, dingy room or making song selections out in bright, direct sunlight. ¬©¬† Digital Spy That's not all that's been squeezed under the hood, either. As well as all the usual accelerometers and gyroscopes, Apple's thrown integrated GPS into the mix. Why should you care? Well, that means you can now leave your iPhone at home when you go out on a run without losing out on detailed tracking of your session. Sorry Android users, the Apple Watch doesn't play nice with your device. On the hardware side this might just be an Apple Watch Series 2 in disguise, but it's the device's software that really sets it apart as something special. Yes, watchOS 3 might still run the show - that means you can still send and receive calls, texts, emails and WhatsApps from your wrist - but it's been topped with a couple of Nike-inspired touches and bespoke watch faces. Like the running brand's bespoke straps, these are exclusive to this edition. ¬©¬† Digital Spy What do they add? Well, aside from a bit of bright, bold Nike design cool, they put the brilliant Nike+ Run Club app at your fingertips without having to do a bunch of menu hopping. Each of the four custom faces are fully customisable with various colours and complication configurations (the little app-shortcut icons). They give the watch a cool, unique look, one that's a little less Apple and little more Nike. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below It is very much a surface change though. Move past the faces and Nike+ Run Club app, and everything goes very Apple again. This is no great hardship, but as fitness fans, we'd love to see this Nike skin run a little deeper. Why the black and volt colour scheme at least couldn't be run throughout the watch is a little frustrating. Apple Watch Nike+ Fitness Tracking: The real star of the show ¬©¬† Digital Spy Related: Best Apple Watch accessories OK, this is what you're really wanting to know about right? If you're considering the Apple Watch Nike+, chances are you're a bit of a fitness fiend ‚Äì or at least aren't afraid of lacing up your running shoes once a week. Well good news, because the Apple Watch Nike+ is going to make you want to go running. OK, 'want' is a strong word, but thanks to the Nike+ Run Club app that's so seamlessly integrated here, it will actively encourage you to put your sofa-loving, cake-eating days behind you and lace up your trainers instead. Yes, any Apple Watch can tell you how far you've run, and how quickly you've run it ‚Äì pretty damn accurately with its integrated GPS ‚Äì but the Nike+ model takes things a step further by using this data to help you improve. You're not left to your own devices when it comes to getting fit either. The Rub Club app plays host to your own personal 'My Coach' element. Whether you're looking to get into running for the first time, simply improve your fitness or move towards a new PB, there are coaching regimes that can be tailored to you. And a simple set-up process will help tailor things to you without making exercise feel daunting. ¬©¬† Digital Spy We're currently a week into an 8-week training programme, and so far we've found our coach helpful but not life-changing. You'll still need a bit of self-motivation to keep going, but the prompts and data breakdowns do make understanding your improvements and future fitness efforts easier. During runs your wrist is filled with all the realtime data you'll want ‚Äì speed, time, distance ‚Äì and at this stage we're confident that come week eight, the programme will have helped us reach our goals, with the adaptive coach to only improve at helping us refine our efforts. Just want to run for the fun of it? No problem, there's plenty of cool fitness features thrown in that don't involve the digital coach. Highlights include the ability to schedule runs by looking at the hour-to-hour weather forecast ‚Äì soggy socks be gone ‚Äì kick start runs with the help of Siri and, if you're in a hurry and running a regular route, skipping all the set-up by select to rerun your last effort. There's no need to worry about your run data being skewed by pesky traffic lights either. Stop to wait for the little green man and the watch will notice you've stopped and pause your run automatically. Set off again and it will start up without prompting. Come the end of the run, all this data will then be fed back into Apple's own Activity app for simple, single-location tracking on all devices. ¬©¬† Digital Spy Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Struggling to see the originality in it all? Well, you're right. All of this can be achieved with a standard Apple Watch and a download of the Nike+ Run Club app. Sure, you'll miss out on the watch faces, but everything else is the same. What really makes this stand out and line out as a snip about the standard Watch for true fitness fans, however, is the fluidity of it all. Those watch faces let the world know you're a runner, yes, but they also help get you motivated. Having that constant reminder that this is a running watch as much as a message-providing smartwatch attached to your wrist is enough to push you off the sofa. The coach is an addition that will grow the more you use it, and having the Nike+ Run Club app just a click away and encouraging you to keep fit is a major boon for regular runners or those looking for the motivation to become one. Apple Watch Nike+ Battery Life: A comfort blanket of stability ¬©¬† Digital Spy Related: iPhone 7 vs iPhone 6S Tracking your daily runs is great for working towards fitness goals. It's not so hot when it comes to keeping battery life in the green though. Fortunately, the Apple Watch Nike+ has enough staying power to stand up to your GPS-utilising, heart rate-monitoring, Bluetooth headphones-connected running ways. And then some. No, you're not going to get a week's worth of usage out of it before a return trip to the mains, but show us a smartwatch capable of that. What you will get, however, is two full days of steady usage. Answer your messages, take a couple of calls, track your daily exercise sessions and you'll cruise through two full days' use and comfortably into a third. This is crucial, not just to avoid the nightmare of nightly charges, but it means you can wear your Apple Watch Nike+ on a weekend away or during an impromptu sleepover without having to worry about carrying another charger with you. It takes the battery worry out of the equation, and that's key to making this a longterm smartwatch success rather than something that's going to be consigned to a draw in a couple of months. Apple Watch Nike+ Verdict: The ULTIMATE smartwatch ¬©¬† Digital Spy Seriously impressive smartwatch, check. Elegant, accessible running watch capable of transforming you from a sofa addict to a running fiend, check. The Apple Watch Nike+ really is the best of both worlds. While a lot of gadgets take on too much, this is very much a case of jack of all trades, master of everything. Will this appease all fitness fanatics? Mostly. If you're into ultra marathons and week-long treks across barren wilderness, chances are you're going to want something a little more specialist. For the general fitness fan ‚Äì everyone from the once-a-week shuffling jogger to those looking to trump their 10K or marathon PB ‚Äì however, the Apple Watch Nike+ is the ultimate in smartwatch refinement. What's more, pleasingly it's no more expensive than its standardly specced sibling. The 38mm model will hit you for ¬£369 while the 42mm unit will cost ¬£399. That's a lot of money, yes, but it's considerably less than that gym membership you never use though. At least this will give you the motivation to get fit. If you've got even a passing interest in keeping fit, this is the smartwatch we'd recommend.

The company is also optimistic about future growth of the iPhones in India as well on the back of its pact with Reliance Jio, improving 4G infrastructure in the country, and increasing appetite of the middle class for smartphones.Xiaomi Mi Note 2, Mi MIX not launching in India Xiaomi broke the hearts of many of its fans in India today with the announcement that it currently has no plans to bring the Mi Note 2 and Mi MIX smartphones to the country. This will disappoint potential buyers who had their hearts set on the Mi Note 2 either as a replacement for the ill-fated Samsung Galaxy Note 7 or as a pocket-friendly phablet with powerful features. (Also see:¬†Which Is the Right Samsung Galaxy Note 7 Replacement, Xiaomi Mi Note 2 or¬†Google Pixel XL?) Reliance Jio starts hurting Airtel's mobile business Airtel in its Q2 earnings call said that its mobile business suffered during the period because competition from a new carrier led to slow growth in the mobile business. Gopal Vittal, the company's managing director and chief executive for India and South Asia, said its "mobile business has experienced a slowdown in growth due to free services being offered by a new operator," obliquely suggesting Reliance Jio, without naming the company. Airtel also launched the new 10-day international roaming packs with free calling minutes, messages, incoming calls, and bundled data. Apple accidentally leaks new MacBook Pro's new feature Just a month after it leaked the new iPhones via its Twitter account, Apple is at it again, giving the world a glimpse at some of the features fans can expect from the upcoming MacBook Pro. With the commercial release of macOS 10.12.1 Sierra, Apple has leaked images of the upcoming MacBook Pro, just ahead of its launch event on Thursday. The images confirm the arrival of the rumoured Magic Toolbar OLED touch panel, which is expected to replace the function keys on the keyboard, as well as the arrival of the Touch ID fingerprint sensor. More Samsung Galaxy S8 features leaked A new report claims that Samsung Galaxy S8 will feature a 5.5-inch display touting 4K resolution (2160x3840 pixels), Exynos 8895 SoC, and 6GB of RAM. This comes a couple of weeks after a report saying that the smartphone, which has apparently been delayed, will have a 16-megapixel and 8-megapixel dual-camera setup on the back. Other rumoured features of the Galaxy S8 include a bezel-less design, no Home button, and fingerprint-sensing display. Google may be making more money on Pixel XL than Apple does on iPhone 7 In a tear-down of the Pixel XL, research firm IHS Markit has revealed that the bill of materials for the 32GB variant of smartphone stands at $285.75. This gives Google a margin of $485.35 (against the device's selling price of $769), higher than the $424 margin that Apple makes on the iPhone 7. Flipkart loses yet another top executive Continuing its streak of losing top executives, Flipkart on Wednesday confirmed that its chief financial officer Sanjay Baweja would leave the company on December 31, 2016. The biggest e-commerce player in India has already started looking for Baweja's replacement.

Bridget Carey highlights everything Microsoft announced at its big news event. by Bridget Carey 2:26 Close Drag One thing the new MacBooks are not expected to have are touchscreens. Microsoft and Windows PC makers popularized the screens in computers and hybrid devices that convert between tablets and laptops. But Apple has resisted putting touchscreens in its computers, saying they don't make sense. Microsoft says lack of touchscreens hurts customers. "At this point, they're really doing customers a disservice to not to have an option for touch on a MacBook," Hall said Wednesday. "We're going to announce tomorrow a trade-in program so that people who feel disappointed by the Mac not going all the way to touch screen can trade in" their Apple computers for Surface.

Most Popular Apple announced that its anticipated AirPods, a pair of wireless headphones, will no longer ship this month as planned. The AirPods were introduced in September alongside the iPhone 7, which was designed without a standard headphone jack. An Apple¬†iPhone 7 with AirPods. Credit: Apple "We don't believe in shipping a product before it's ready, and we need a little more time before AirPods are ready for our customers," Trudy Muller, an Apple spokeswoman, said Wednesday. Apple didn't provide a technical reason for the delay nor a new shipping date. The delay comes on the eve of Apple's scheduled Thursday event for its updated Mac computer line, when the AirPods' availability also was expected to be announced. The AirPods delay is the first hardware-related postponement in more than five years from the company. A version of the iPhone 4 in the color white was announced in June 2010, but didn't ship to customers until April 2011 because of a production problem. On the software side, Apple delayed the release of iTunes 11 in 2012 by a month to fix bugs.

"During my testing one of the AirPods had trouble holding a charge, so Apple swapped it out," Walt Mossberg, of the technology website The Verge, wrote in September. Other reviewers noticed problems with music playback, a key feature of the AirPods. The introduction of the product spurred criticism that the cordless earphones could easily be lost. Comedian Conan O'Brien mocked the device with a spoof of an iPod ad that showed people dancing and the AirPods flying out their ears into a sewage drain. The device is planned as part of a growing number of accessories that work around Apple's most important product, the iPhone. Chief Design Officer Jony Ive last month referred to the AirPods as the start of a new wireless future for the company. The $159 accessory comes with a charging case that doubles as a mechanism to initially pair the headphones to the iPhone. With iCloud, the AirPods can automatically be matched with other Apple devices like computers and watches. -- Bloomberg News In this article: CMO Strategy Consumer Electronics Digital Mobile Music Retail Technology Telecommunications Become a Member Register Now Renew Membership Benefits Datacenter Advertising Age ¬† ¬† Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Instagram YouTube Tumblr Copyright ¬© 1994-2016 Crain Communications Privacy Statement Terms of Use About Us Advertise Reprints Contact Us AD AGE Creativity LookBook Datacenter Resources Events Jobs On Campus Site by AREA 17 x Scroll to Continue

"Right now demand is the secret sauce driving stocks higher. Is there demand for the product and does it exceed supply? That's how you sort out the winners from the losers in this peculiar environment," the "Mad Money" host said. In the banking industry, KeyCorp CEO Beth Mooney told Cramer on Tuesday that average loans rose year over year. The same thing happened with Apple. Cramer noted that demand for the new iPhone greatly exceeded supply after the tech giant reported earnings Tuesday. "You know what actually paid to listen to? Tim Cook, who came right here in the low $90s and told you a darned good story. He was right, they were wrong," Cramer said. Eduardo Munoz | Reuters Customers look at the iPhone 7 smartphone inside an Apple store in New York. Cramer thought Apple reported a fantastic quarter on Tuesday. Yet, the analysts on the conference call made investors feel like Apple could face real trouble. "I was stunned by the analyst community's lack of respect for CEO Tim Cook when I listened to the call," Cramer said. He could not ignore the level of contempt and disrespect for Apple, especially considering how positive some of the same analysts are about IBM, Oracle and Microsoft. Meanwhile, IBM has been on a decline for five years, and Cramer found the tone of the call to be far more respectful. "Apple is held to a higher standard, even though it has one of the cheapest stocks out there. I don't know what's wrong with these analysts with their faux buy recommendations, but I think they could benefit from some therapy," Cramer said. Norfolk Southern delivered a third-quarter surprise on Wednesday when it managed to report an earnings beat, even with major cargoes like coal in a secular decline. Cramer spoke with Norfolk Southern's chairman and CEO Jim Squires, who revealed how the company continues to improve amid a difficult environment. "There is always opportunity through business process improvements and through working our assets ever harder. We are very focused on productivity. That has been the source of a lot of our improvements this year," Squires said. Adam Jeffery | CNBC Tim Cook Cramer focused on Snap-On as a once red-hot stock that lost its momentum, and could be ready to roar again. After spending years climbing higher, Snap-On's stock fell hard, down 9 percent for the year. Snap-On is the maker of high quality tools and diagnostic equipment for auto repair and other industries. Last week it reported a strong quarter, and Cramer suspects that the stock could be ready to go higher. After management provided bullish commentary on the conference call, Cramer thought the organic growth of the company could signal good things for the stock. He spoke with Snap-On's chairman and CEO Nick Pinchuk on why organic growth is important. "For us, organic growth is rolling out products that people really want ‚Ä¶ What we like to say is that we have runways for growth. One of those for growth for us is to expand with repair shop owners and managers," Pinchuk said. Alkermes also made an incredible comeback when the stock recently surged 30 percent in one day after the company announced positive clinical trial data for an anti-depressant drug that previously failed to meet its targets. Alkermes is a drug delivery company that also develops proprietary medications for mental illness, addiction, diabetes, Alzheimer's and multiple sclerosis. Cramer spoke with Alkermes' CEO Richard Pops, who explained that part of the difficulty in doing clinical research on depression is that enrolled patients in a trial often get better by participating in the trial itself, called the placebo effect. "So, when the study failed in January, we looked at the data, and the data always tells you the truth. And in the data we saw a clear signal of activity of 5461. We just hadn't designed the trial exactly the right way," Pops said. In the Lightning Round, Cramer gave his take on a few caller favorite stocks: Dollar Tree: "This stock has been in free-fall, along with Dollar General. I'm beginning to wonder if they aren't ready to bottom. But if you think they are, the better one to do is buy a stock called TJX, which my charitable trust owns ... It's a discounter that I think has a better stream of revenue, particularly with Macy's closing some stores soon." Owens-Illinois: "They had a good quarter. I've been waiting for that. I love the glass business because it's recycling. Do you know that in certain parts of Latin America they use jars from Owens-Illinois 30 times. Glass should be more sustainably viewed in this country. I like the story here."

As Windows 10 hits its stride, MacOS is wheezing Matt Smith Digital TrendsOctober 26, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share On June 10, 2013, Apple announced OS X 10.9 Mavericks, and for a moment it seemed the company was on the verge of using its success in smartphones and tablets to make Mac OS X the best desktop option. Unlike previous updates, Mavericks was free. It was also released just a year after OS X 10.8, and marked the beginning of a yearly update cadence. Microsoft, meanwhile, was struggling with Windows 8. The Windows 8.1 update was still underway, and wouldn‚Äôt be released until October 18 of 2013. Apple was moving quickly, nimbly, while the old-fashioned Redmond behemoth stumbled along. My, what a difference a few years can make. Everything you can do, I‚Äôve already done I‚Äôve already written about my disappointment with MacOS Sierra. The operating system‚Äôs headline feature, Siri, does something that Windows 10 has done since release ‚Äì in a more limited, more confusing fashion. Microsoft didn‚Äôt talk much about its digital assistant at its October 26 event, because it didn‚Äôt have to. Cortana has been around for some time. Nor did the company speak at all about many of the features that make Windows 10 great. We heard only a little bit about notifications, and nothing at all about the taskbar, multi-tasking, or the start menu. And we didn‚Äôt have to. With Windows 10, Microsoft laid a solid foundation, one that simply exceeds the capability of MacOS. Putting that in place has allowed Windows to add capabilities that most of us never imagined we‚Äôd want. Pushing boundaries Touch is, of course, a key example. The mess that was Windows 8 convinced the world that touch is useless on the PC. But Microsoft didn‚Äôt give up. It trudged on, and now it‚Äôs working on programs like Paint 3D, a stylus and touch-capable application that will be bundled into the Windows Creator Update, and will help people of any experience level start working directly with 3D models and content. Related: Microsoft unveils pricey but powerful Surface Book update, Surface Studio at NY event Is it a bit niche? Yes, it is. But it‚Äôs very useful to those who need it, or are interested in it. And it‚Äôs something that a Mac physically can‚Äôt do. Unless Apple surprises us with a touchscreen MacBook Pro tomorrow, only iOS will be able to answer. And that carries its own problems. microsoft outpaces apple windows creators updateMore Aaron Cassara/Digital Trends microsoft outpaces apple windows creators updateMore Read More Aaron Cassara/Digital Trends microsoft outpaces apple windows creators updateMore Aaron Cassara/Digital Trends microsoft outpaces apple windows creators updateMore Aaron Cassara/Digital Trends Aaron Cassara/Digital Trends That‚Äôs just the beginning. Microsoft‚Äôs push towards 3D content creation in the Windows 10 Creators Update has an obvious goal, and that‚Äôs empowering augmented and virtual reality. Microsoft already told us that HoloLens compatibility is being built into Windows 10, a feature called Windows HoloGraphic. Now, we see that Microsoft is also considering how people will build content for an augmented or virtual reality experience. Apple has not even touched that space. The Mac doesn‚Äôt work with virtual reality headsets, and most Macs aren‚Äôt fast enough to power them, anyway. Tim Cook has been praising the virtues of augmented reality on his interview circuit, but right now it‚Äôs Microsoft, not Apple, that‚Äôs building an ecosystem of hardware and software for it. Microsoft deserves a lot of credit. This is cutting-edge stuff. HoloLens has its problems, but it remains a unique proposition, even more so than virtual reality headsets. It‚Äôs like nothing we‚Äôve ever seen before. Yet, at the same time, it‚Äôs being built in a way that could make it broadly usable by many people, with a variety of hardware. That‚Äôs just smart. Gaming is kind of a big deal, guys Touch and augmented reality aren‚Äôt the only gaps in the Mac‚Äôs armor, though. Microsoft also took aim at another that, though it might seem trivial, has become a serious pain for anyone who likes the Mac. The Mac doesn‚Äôt have game. Apple just doesn‚Äôt seem to care. Though it bizarrely talks up the Apple TV as a game console replacement (come on, guys, really?) it neglects making basic updates to Mac‚Äôs OpenGL support. Instead, Apple has decided to lean on Metal, its own API. That makes it easier for app developers to bring in games from iOS. But those, to be frank, aren‚Äôt the games Mac owners crave. Windows 10 Creators UpdateMore Aaron Cassara/Digital Trends The result is obvious. Back in 2010, over 8 percent of Steam gamers were using Mac OS X. Today, that market share has shrunk to a mere 3.5 percent. And it‚Äôs no wonder. Well over half the most popular games on Steam don‚Äôt support MacOS. Blizzard, meanwhile, for the first time and years opted not to support MacOS with Overwatch. The game‚Äôs director, Jeff Kaplan, was blunt about it. When Polygon asked him about the lack of support, he said ‚Äúwith the technology behind Macs and the way Overwatch runs it‚Äôs just too challenging for us at this point to support it.‚Äù Translation? Macs are slow and their API support is bad, so we didn‚Äôt do it. Microsoft, meanwhile, is on the bleeding age. Gaming was a key pillar of its Windows 10 Creators Edition announcement. Gamers can tap directly into Microsoft‚Äôs Xbox service to stream content, voice chat with friends, or create tournaments. And then there‚Äôs Minecraft, which is being used as not just a game, but also a content creation platform for kids. Apple can only dream of offering the same. That matters. People don‚Äôt want to buy separate computers for work and play. They want one that can do everything they need. A Windows 10 device can be that. A Mac? Not so much. Sprinting ahead So, Windows 10 has support for features MacOS hasn‚Äôt even teased, and can play games that the Mac simply can‚Äôt run. That‚Äôs not great for Apple. And the timing couldn‚Äôt be worse. Apple just released its big update. For most people ‚Äì those not in the beta program ‚Äì MacOS Sierra is barely more than a month old. That means the next update is almost a year away. Windows 10 Creators UpdateMore Aaron Cassara/Digital Trends Windows 10‚Äôs Creators Update doesn‚Äôt have a release date yet, but it‚Äôs slated for ‚Äúearly 2017.‚Äù And you don‚Äôt even need to wait until then. If you join the Windows Insider program, you can expect to see many of the relevant updates trickle out over the next few months. Worse still for Apple, Microsoft is likely planning two major Windows 10 updates in 2017. That means MacOS 10.13 might be released alongside a second Windows 10 update. Where does the Mac go from here? There‚Äôs a saving grace. Apple has an event scheduled tomorrow. There we‚Äôll see new Mac hardware. I‚Äôm sure it will be good. In fact, it‚Äôll probably be better than the hardware Microsoft showed today. While imaginative, the Surface line can be a bit unwieldy in actual use, and has been plagued with bugs. But this isn‚Äôt a battle of hardware. It‚Äôs a battle of operating systems. If MacOS falls too far behind, then people won‚Äôt want to use it, no matter how good the new MacBook is. Related: Microsoft Surface Pro 4 review Perhaps Apple is okay with that. Mac is only 12 percent of the company, after all, and it‚Äôs be simpler for Apple if it could find some way to elevate iOS to replace the Mac, and indeed, the iPad Pro is already trying to do just that. That fact, however, isn‚Äôt going to bring peace of mind to Mac fans. Apple sorely needs to give its desktop operating system the attention it deserves. Today‚Äôs Microsoft is in finer form than ever in the company‚Äôs history, and its making Apple‚Äôs MacOS update pace ‚Äì which, just a few years ago, felt lightning quick ‚Äì is starting to feel sluggish.

Demitrios Kalogeropoulos (TMFSigma) Oct 26, 2016 at 5:43PM Stocks turned in mixed results on Wednesday, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average¬†(DJINDICES:^DJI)¬†rose slightly while the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC)¬†ticked lower. Image source: Getty Images. Today's stock market Index Percentage Change Point Change Dow 0.17% 30.06 S&P 500 (0.17%) (3.73) Data source: Yahoo! Finance. The SPDR Select Financial Sector Fund (NYSEMKT:XLF) saw heavy trading ahead of the Federal Reserve's monetary policy meeting next week. Economists don't expect an interest rate hike to happen at that meeting, but hints about a possible December increase could boost prospects for banks. Meanwhile, the United States Oil Fund (NYSEMKT:USO) fell 1.3% as oil prices fell back below $50 per barrel. Individual stocks on the move included Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and iRobot (NASDAQ:IRBT), which swung in opposite directions following their latest earnings announcements. Apple's profit letdown Apple was the Dow's biggest decliner, falling 2.3% after revealing a 9% revenue decline and a 19% drop in earnings for its fiscal fourth quarter. As expected, the consumer tech titan's results were pressured by a double-digit drop in iPhone sales. That segment makes up over 60% of the business, and fell 13% as unit sales worsened to 45.5 million from 48 million in the prior-year period. On the positive side, average selling prices, which have trended lower after the release of the iPhone SE model, ticked up sequentially and may be headed back toward $700 per unit. Image source: Apple. Of course, the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus weren't available for most of the quarter and sales of those popular products are still constrained by supply. Management sounded confident that the refreshed lineup is being well received. "We're thrilled with the customer response to iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, and Apple Watch Series 2," CEO Tim Cook said in a press release. Apple's guidance for the current quarter calls for a return to revenue growth after three consecutive quarters of declines. Yet its profitability forecast, of roughly 38% gross margin, was lower than expected. Judging by the 20% stock price rise in the three months leading up to this report, Wall Street was simply hoping for a more aggressive earnings outlook from Cook and his executive team. iRobot's holiday season forecast iRobot shares spiked 12% to reach a new all-time high following quarterly results that position the robotic tech specialist for a banner holiday season ahead. Third-quarter sales jumped 17% and net income soared 52% higher as both the top and bottom lines beat management's July guidance. "Our third-quarter performance was outstanding," CEO Colin Angle said in a press release, partly thanks to what executives described as successful marketing programs for its consumer products like the Roomba line of home-cleaning robots. Image source: iRobot. It wasn't all good news for investors, though. Gross profit margin fell by a full percentage point as the average selling price of robot units declined to $229 from $252. Overall, though, iRobot is preparing for a solid finish to its fiscal year. Orders already received from retailers, plus the anticipated orders for the fourth quarter, suggest substantial sales gains ahead. As a result, management raised full-year guidance for the second straight quarter, bumping the revenue forecast up to $653 million from $642 million. The profit outlook also edged up to $40 million from $38 million as the company believes it has hit the right balance of product innovations and pricing to drive a 25% sales boost in the key U.S. market this year.

What does the Mac maker have in the pipeline? Evan Niu (TMFNewCow) Oct 26, 2016 at 5:54PM Image source: Apple. One of Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) greatest strengths has always been its financial discipline when it comes to research and development expenditures. The Mac maker's R&D investments were so efficient that it was spending a very small percentage of revenue on R&D, while new products drove incredible revenue growth. It used to be common for R&D to be between 2% and 3% of sales (at times even under 2%), while peers would spend double-digit percentages of revenue on R&D. What we've seen in recent years is a precipitous rise in Apple's R&D budget as a percentage of sales. Data source: SEC filings. Fiscal quarters shown. Graph by author. At least one Street analyst is a little worried. But not too worried On the earnings call, Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty asked CEO Tim Cook about the divergence of R&D growth and revenue growth: Huberty: That's great color. Thank you for that. A follow-up for Tim. What should we read into the fact that R&D has more than doubled over the past three years while sales growth was sort of a fifth of that? Are R&D investments just less efficient than they were in the company's history, or should we think about that as incremental spend for products that haven't yet come to market? Cook: There's clearly some amount of R&D that are on products that today are in the development phase that have not reached the market, and so that's a part of it. And we feel really great about the things that we've got. We've also put a lot of emphasis on our services business as well and on making the ecosystem even better. And so we're very much, we're confidently investing in the future, and that's the reason you see the R&D spend increasing. Cook's answer is an expected one, as Apple is naturally investing heavily in various areas that it won't talk about quite yet, such as augmented reality/virtual reality, autonomous cars, and more. For reference, here's a chart of the two growth rates that Huberty is looking at. Data source: SEC filings. Fiscal quarters shown. Chart by author. When it comes down to it, the real issue isn't whether or not R&D growth outpaces sales growth. Those percentages without the context of absolute values don't paint the full picture. Huberty is right to pay attention to an important trend, since Apple spent a cool $10 billion on R&D last fiscal year, of which $1.9 billion was stock-based compensation. The real question will be whether or not any of the products in Apple's pipeline can generate meaningful revenue growth in the future. And keep in mind that Apple's revenue base is so enormous at this point ($215 billion) that every basis point of growth helps. Evan Niu, CFA owns shares of Apple.

In a statement sent to TechCrunch, Apple says they need ‚Äòa little more time‚Äô before AirPods will be available. ‚ÄúThe early response to AirPods has been incredible. We don‚Äôt believe in shipping a product before it‚Äôs ready, and we need a little more time before AirPods are ready for our customers,‚Äù an Apple spokesperson said to TechCrunch. The AirPods were originally announced back in September alongside the iPhone 7. It has a retail price of $159 and includes Apple‚Äôs W1 chip that allows for easy pairing. The Bluetooth earbuds were slated for a ‚Äòlate October‚Äô release with many thinking they‚Äôd go on sale as soon as tomorrow or Friday (with Monday being the latest), given the ‚Äòlate October‚Äô promise. Unfortunately, beyond this Apple has yet to give us a date on when they‚Äôll become available. We assume they‚Äôll be available in a few weeks in November.

October 26 AAPL: 115.59 -2.66 New ‚ÄòLaunchpad‚Äô icon replaces ‚ÄòHome‚Äô on iCloud.com, likely a minor change for¬†consistency Chance Miller - 3 weeks ago @ChanceHMiller Apple View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Ahead of its big Mac refresh tomorrow, Apple today has made a subtle change to iCloud.com. Where there used to be a ‚ÄúHome‚Äù quick link, Apple¬†has recently updated the iconography to display a new ‚ÄúLaunchpad‚Äù icon, similar to that on macOS. Now, when you click in the upper-right hand corner of any app and bring up icon grid, you‚Äôll see a new ‚ÄúLaunchpad‚Äù option where the previous ‚ÄúHome‚Äù icon was. Now, before we read too much into this, it‚Äôs likely¬†nothing too notable‚Ä¶ Apple made the change around a week ago and it‚Äôs flown relatively under the radar since then. The likely reasoning for Apple‚Äôs decision is to avoid confusion with its new Home app. iOS 10, of course, introduces an all-new Home app that allows you to manage your HomeKit accessories and features an icon very similar to that of the old ‚ÄúHome‚Äù icon on iCloud.com. On iCloud.com, though, the Home quick link simply returned you back to the home screen of apps. The change to a Launchpad icon has caused some eager users to speculate that it could be a hint at future support for web apps, seeing that on macOS, the Launchpad icon brings up a icon grid of all your Mac applications. While it‚Äôs certainly possible that Apple is planning to launch support for web apps, the more likely reasoning for the change is consistency between macOS and iCloud.com, as well as to avoid confusion with iOS 10‚Äôs Home app. Web apps would be an interesting choice for Apple, who has long opted for native¬†applications, even in the case of cross-platform services like iTunes and Apple Music. Web apps wouldn‚Äôt significantly benefit macOS users, either, as Apple applications generally sync well between devices. Web apps, however, would allow macOS users to access services if they were using a Windows PC. Currently, iCloud.com has web apps for a variety of Apple services, including Mail, Pages, Keynote, Numbers, and Find My iPhone. Services like iMessage, FaceTime, and iTunes aren‚Äôt supported though. Nevertheless, this change on Apple‚Äôs part is likely nothing more than a change in favor of consistency and less confusion. Though, we‚Äôre curious, would you use iCloud web apps?

October 26 AAPL: 115.59 -2.66 Report: Apple to unveil universal TV guide tomorrow, aggregates video from various sources ‚Ä¶ but not¬†Netflix Benjamin Mayo - 3 weeks ago @bzamayo Apple TV View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Apple¬†is¬†reportedly set to launch a smart TV guide for Apple TV tomorrow, as parts of its ‚Äòhello again‚Äô event. The¬†TV guide will aggregate different sources of TV shows and movies into a single view, so users do not have constantly switch between app to find something to watch, according to Recode. The interface will summarize what‚Äôs available to watch and then¬†direct¬†users to¬†the respective apps with deep linking for the selected¬†content.¬†Apple¬†has partnered with video providers to bring this feature to market but apparently Netflix content will not be¬†available. The feature will also be available on iOS devices, not just tvOS. Talks of a digital TV guide¬†for internet streaming video first¬†surfaced in August. Earlier, USA Today said that Apple was set¬†to announce a ‚ÄòWatch List‚Äô app¬†for Apple TV, suggesting relevant shows as a queue. It is not clear if the TV guide and watch list features are independent¬†apps, but it would make sense for the watch list to be a feature inside of the encompassing TV guide experience on Apple TV. It seems likely that Single-Sign On will also debut tomorrow, initially promised as a tvOS 10 feature but¬†subsequently delayed. A combination of a personalized TV guide and easy login would be a significant enhancement to the Apple TV experience, where video¬†apps¬†are currently siloed into their own discrete elements. The report does not detail which video partners have signed up to be a part of the Apple TV guide, apart from¬†noting that Netflix will not¬†be participating. This is somewhat strange as the streaming service was a headline partner for universal search via Siri when the Apple TV was first launched. ¬†It is also not clear how the TV guide would be exposed on iOS (perhaps as a new section in the Videos app?). We‚Äôll have to wait for the event to understand the whole story. Apple‚Äôs ‚Äúhello again‚Äù event kicks off tomorrow at 10 AM Pacific time. As well as¬†new¬†Apple TV¬†improvements, the¬†announcements are likely going to be headlined by the introduction of new Macs.

 Apple added only 6,000 people last year ‚Äî its slowest growth since 2009 Kif Leswing Oct. 26, 2016, 6:45 PM 2,797 facebook linkedin twitter email print Getty Apple reported its first annual revenue decline since 2001 on Tuesday.¬† And because there was¬†less money coming in, Apple hired fewer people last year.¬† Apple says it had 116,000 full-time employees in a filing with the SEC published¬†on Wednesday.¬†In 2015, Apple had 110,000. That means¬†Apple only added¬†6000 full-time employees last year. In fact, last year Apple was the company's slowest headcount growth since the depths of the recession in 2009, when it only¬†had 24,300, up 2,300 employees from 2008.¬† These figures include Apple's large retail operation. Apple doesn't specify how many of its employees work in retail anymore, but the last time it reported these numbers in 2014,¬†46,200 of Apple's 92,600 employees worked at an Apple Store.¬† Apple is¬†clearly not hiring like it did in 2014 and 2015, when it added 12,300 and 17,400 employees, respectively.¬† Apple's appetite for space has not slowed, though. Apple will complete its new corporate campus next year, and it added 3.8 million square feet of building space, and bought 826 acres of land.¬† Visit Markets Insider for constantly updated market quotes for individual stocks, ETFs, indices, commodities and currencies traded around the world.

CEO Tim Cook, while on stage, said Apple wants Apple TV to be "the one place to access all of your television... a unified TV experience". He then announced the TV app, and said it will "completely change how you watch TV on your Apple TV as well as your iPhone and iPad". The new TV app brings all the TV shows and movies from across all your apps to one place. In an on-stage demo, Apple showed how the app surfaces content from all your apps, and then when you select a movie or show, it kicks you into that app. When you press menu, you end up back in the individual app's UI, but you can back to the TV app by pressing the TV button on the remote. Also, when you install a new app on your Apple TV, the TV app will instantly sign you in with your cable single-sign on, and it'll load "Watch Now" with content. Watch Now is where you will see a collection of available shows and movies from iTunes and apps. The TV app can also access your collection of iTunes movies an shows rented or purchased on iTunes. The TV app, which releases later this year, works on iPhone and iPad too. As for that single sign on feature, it's a simplified way for Americans to enjoy their pay-TV video apps. Starting in December, subscribers to DirecTV, Dish Network, and more will just sign in once on Apple TV, iPhone, and iPad to enjoy immediate access to apps that are part of their pay-TV subscription. Apple said Siri will also know all sports schedules and which games can be watched live. In other words, Siri is now aware of live sporting events across apps, so you can simply say things like, ‚ÄúWatch the Stanford game‚Äù, and then it'll surface that exact live game for you to immediately watch. Apple Apple kicked off its event on 27 October with a keynote at 10 am PST. To watch the live stream for yourself or read about what was officially announced, see Pocket-lint's guide. The tagline to Apple's event, "hello again," is an obvious nod to the Mac, as Apple originally introduced the product with the word "hello" in 1984.¬†Several reports therefore claimed Apple will likely introduce new Macs.

Health care companies fell and Apple pulled technology companies down, but banks rose. Share Facebook Twitter Google Email Go To Comments Earlier in the day, stocks had appeared to be headed for a second day of notable losses, but they recovered some of that lost ground in late trading. Weak earnings for major companies hurt real estate investment trusts and health care companies. Tech stocks slid as investors were unimpressed with Apple's latest results. Banks continued to report strong earnings and Boeing boosted industrial companies. Stocks have not made many big moves the last two weeks. "Trading volume has really dropped off," said Scott Wren, a senior global equity strategist at the Wells Fargo Investment Institute. He said investors are being cautious as they wait for the outcome of November's election. The Dow Jones industrial average added 30.06 points, or 0.2%, to 18,199.33. In early trading it fell more than 100 points. The Standard & Poor's 500 index sank 3.73 points, or 0.2%, to 2,139.43. The Nasdaq composite shed 33.13 points, or 0.6%, to 5,250.27. While individual companies might rise or fall based on their earnings, Mr Wren said investors don't care that much if overall corporate profits rise or fall this quarter. Earnings have been falling for more than a year but the drops are getting smaller. "All the market wants in terms of earnings is a continuation of a pattern this year of quarter-to-quarter improvement," he said. Apple sank 2.66 dollars, or 2.2%, to 115.59 dollars after it reported another drop in iPhone sales. Apple gets about two-thirds of its revenue from the iPhone and some investors are concerned it depends too much on its marquee product. The company expects sales to start growing again in the holiday season after a recent slump. The losses for Apple, by far the biggest company in the S&P 500, sent tech stocks lower. That cancelled out big jumps in Akamai Technologies and Juniper Networks, which each surged more than 10% after strong results. Medical device maker Edwards Lifesciences reported disappointing sales of heart devices and forecast another shortfall in the current quarter, and its stock slid 19.43 dollars, or 17.1% to 94.25 dollars. Medical lab operator Laboratory Corp. of America sank 11.95 dollars, or 8.6%, to 126.46 dollars after a disappointing report. Drugmaker Merck gave up most of its gains from the previous day and fell 1.08 dollars, or 1.7%, to 60.87 dollars. Financial firms continued to report strong third-quarter results. Regional bank Huntington Bancshares gained 51 cents, or 5%, to 10.70 dollars and insurer Chubb rose 4.55 dollars, or 3.7%, to 127 dollars. Boeing climbed 6.52 dollars, or 4.7%, to 145.54 dollars after the company raised its forecast for earnings, revenue, and plane deliveries. Boeing was responsible for all of the Dow's gain. Simon Property Group, which owns more than 100 shopping centres around the country, slumped after analysts worried about its performance, including lower income from stores that have been open for more than a year. That counteracted solid earnings, and its stock fell 8.89 dollars, or 4.5%, to 188.38 dollars. Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 1.79% from 1.76%. Mondelez, the maker of Oreo cookies, Cadbury chocolate and Trident gum, climbed after reporting a bigger profit than analysts expected. The company's stock picked up 1.56 dollars, or 3.6%, to 44.32 dollars. Southwest Airlines slipped after it gave a weak revenue forecast for the rest of the year. Ticket prices have been falling for two years and Southwest said prices are still "soft." Its stock lost 3.55 dollars, or 8.5%, to 38.40 dollars, and other airlines including American and United also traded lower. The price of oil fell for the third day in a row. US crude fell 78 cents, or 1.6%, to 49.18 dollars a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, lost 81 cents, to 1.6%, to 49.98 dollars a barrel in London. Sales for Chipotle Mexican Grill fell for the fourth quarter in a row and came in weaker than analysts expected as the company continued to struggle in its efforts to win back customers after food safety scares. The stock lost 37.65 dollars, or 9.3%, to 368.02 dollars, its lowest price in three years. Drugmaker Mylan fell after Kaleo Pharmaceuticals said it will resume selling its emergency allergy shot Auvi-Q next year. That would mean more competition for Mylan's EpiPen. Auvi-Q was taken off the market last year because of the potential for inaccurate dosing, leaving EpiPen without any direct competition. Mylan lost 70 cents, or 1.6%, to 38.08 dollars. The stock is down 22% since mid-August as the company has come under fire for repeatedly raising the price of the EpiPen over the last decade and for overcharging the government for the shot. In other energy trading, wholesale petrol slid two cents to 1.48 dollars a gallon. Heating oil lost one cent to 1.55 dollars a gallon. Natural gas fell four cents to 2.73 dollars per 1,000 cubic feet. Gold fell 7 dollars to 1,266.60 dollars an ounce. Silver lost 15 cents to 17.63 dollars an ounce. Copper was little changed at 2.15 dollars a pound. The dollar inched up to 104.54 yen from 104.22 yen. The euro rose to 1.0906 from 1.0892 dollars. The FTSE 100 of Britain dropped 0.8% while Germany's Dax lost 0.4% and the CAC 40 in France gave up 0.1%. Japan's Nikkei 225 edged 0.2% higher, but Hong Kong's Hang Seng dropped 1% and South Korea's Kospi lost 1.1%.

This is the next-generation TV guide concept we first told you about back in August. The idea is that Apple wants to make it easier to find and watch video content without requiring users to sift through a bunch of apps. Instead, Apple‚Äôs guide will aggregate and show content that‚Äôs available and then send users directly to that content via deep links. The feature is supposed to work on the Apple TV streaming box as well as on other iOS devices like iPhones. Not all major video providers will be participating, however, according to industry sources. Netflix, which has worked closely with Apple in the past ‚Äî and has been a Siri voice search partner for Apple TV ‚Äî won‚Äôt be part of the program, sources say. While everyone with a compatible device will be able to use the new guide, Apple wants to tie it in with a new ‚Äúsingle sign-on‚Äù feature that it announced this past summer at its Worldwide Developers Conference. That service lets users sign in once with participating pay TV subscription credentials to access content in any apps that support the feature. (Users currently have to sign in separately for each app that requires the credentials ‚Äî a clumsy task.) Ideally, customers whose pay TV providers have agreed to the single sign-on program would see content recommendations in the guide from apps that they specifically have access to. This is an evolutionary, incremental step for Apple‚Äôs TV ambitions and not what it wanted to do initially. The company previously tried to create its own pay TV service ‚Äî along the lines of what we‚Äôve seen from Sling, Sony and the new service that AT&T‚Äôs DirecTV announced yesterday ‚Äî but has been unable to strike the deals to make its version of that service work. It had also talked to pay TV distributors like Time Warner Cable about operating as the front end for those companies‚Äô services. Instead, for now, Apple has decided just to take the content that‚Äôs already on these devices ‚Äî major TV networks typically have iOS and Apple TV apps ‚Äî and make it easier to find and use. Apple declined to comment. USA Today previously reported some details of tomorrow‚Äôs launch.

Yet, the analysts on the conference call made investors feel like Apple could face real trouble. "I was stunned by the analyst community's lack of respect for CEO Tim Cook when I listened to the call," the "Mad Money" host said. Cramer's first bone to pick was with Morgan Stanley's Katy Huberty, who gave Apple an overweight rating, and asked CFO Luca Maestri for help to figure out the company's guidance "given all the major projects are running below target." While Apple gave conservative guidance, Cramer pointed out that the iPhone 7 has tremendous demand. Huberty also asked about the doubled R&D budget in the past three years, while sales growth is less than that. Cook responded by saying that the company has spent a lot of money building a services business that generated $6.3 billion in revenue and has a 24 percent accelerating growth rate. The Apple Shocker Adam Jeffery | CNBC Tim Cook "I don't know what's wrong with these analysts with their faux buy recommendations, but I think they could benefit from some therapy." -Jim Cramer It got even worse for Cramer when Sanford Bernstein's Toni Sacconaghi asked Cook why Apple doesn't do better than "flattish" growth given that its largest competitor is in disarray and the company has a new product. He asked what investors should think about the iPhone going forward, and whether it is reasonable to think it is a growing business going forward. "Whoa! Apple just posted $46.9 billion in sales and $9 billion in quarterly net income, substantially better than people expected 90 days ago when we thought it would be a terrible quarter. By the way Sacconaghi asked that question, you would have thought the company has no future," Cramer said. While these are just two examples, Cramer could not ignore the level of contempt and disrespect for Apple, especially considering how positive some of the same analysts are about IBM, Oracle and Microsoft. Meanwhile, IBM has been on a decline for five years, and Cramer found the tone of the call to be far more respectful. "Apple is held to a higher standard, even though it has one of the cheapest stocks out there. I don't know what's wrong with these analysts with their faux buy recommendations, but I think they could benefit from some therapy," Cramer said. Cramer still held firm on his advice to own Apple, not trade it, even after what he considered to be a successful quarter for the company. Questions for Cramer?

Shares of Apple slipped 2.7% in afternoon trading. iPhone coverage: Ask Matt: Has Apple and the iPhone peaked?

Stocks close mixed amid economic data and earnings CNBC 10/26/2016 Fred Imbert Click to expand Replay Video Bond market reels over $1 trillion loss from 'Trump thump' Donald Trump's shocking victory for the White House may end the more than 30-year-old bull run in bonds. According to Reuters, that's because bets on faster U.S. growth and inflation are leading investors to favor stocks over bonds. A two-day thumping wiped out more than $1 trillion across global bond markets worldwide, on bets that plans under a Trump administration would boost business investments and spending while firing up inflation. It was the worst rout in nearly 1-1/2 years.

The Nasdaq lagged, falling 0.63 percent as Apple shed more than 2 percent. US crude settled down 1.6% at $49.18 after the Energy Information Administration reported a drawdown of nearly 600,000 barrels. Oil prices had also fallen earlier on the back of bearish supply data from the American Petroleum Institute. Apple posted a better-than-expected quarterly profit Tuesday after the close, but fell just shy of expectations on sales. The company's cash hoard also hit a record of $238 billion. "It looked like a good quarter, but obviously there were some things that investors didn't like, particularly the fall in its China business," said Trip Miller, managing partner at Gullane Capital Partners. He also said, as an investor in the company, he'd like to see Apple diversify its revenue stream. "I just wonder how long [the iPhone] can be the 'it' phone." Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank, said it's important for earnings to improve so the S&P 500's high valuations can be justified. "The earnings continue to be a little more solid than we expected. The problem is they're not showing solid growth," he said. According to FactSet, S&P's price-to-earnings ratio was 19.65 entering Wednesday's session. Stocks have held in a very tight range recently, with the S&P having gone 24 straight sessions without posting a 1 percent move on a closing basis. The index has also moved just 1.2 percent over the past three months.¬†He also said he'd like to see the company diversify its revenue streamline " I just don't know how long [the iPhone] can be the 'it' phone." Meanwhile, Boeing and Coca-Cola, two other Dow components, posted results Wednesday that beat estimates on both the top and bottom line. Other firms that reported Wednesday include Six Flags, Mondelez and Biogen. "Things have softened up a bit, but I think it will continue to be a net positive quarter for earnings" relative to expectations, said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives at Charles Schwab.

The index has also moved just 1.2 percent over the past three months. In economic news, the October services PMI index jumped to 54.8 from 52.3, while new home sales rose 3.1 percent in September. Mortgage applications fell 4.1 percent last week, despite lower mortgage rates. Economic data have been in focus for investors as the Federal Reserve is scheduled to meet next week. While the central bank is not expected to make any changes to its monetary policy during that meeting, it is largely expected to raise interest rates in December. U.S. Treasurys fell on Wednesday, with the two-year note yield near 0.87 percent and the benchmark 10-year note yield around 1.78 percent. "We can continue to analyze earnings and the economic fundamentals every which way to try to figure out where stocks go but let's be honest, it's all about where rates go in the monetary world we live in," said Peter Boockvar, chief market analyst at The Lindsey Group, in a note. The U.S. dollar fell against a basket of currencies a day after hitting its highest level since February, with the euro near $1.094 and the yen around 104.09. Overseas, European equities were dragged lower by falling oil prices, with the pan-European Stoxx 600 index dropping 0.81 percent. In Asia-Pacific, stocks were lead lower by Australian shares, as the ASX 200 fell 1.53 percent.

I don‚Äôt necessarily¬†want to glom onto it, but with Google‚Äôs apparent inability to create and maintain a solid messaging system for Android users, I can‚Äôt help but wish that the Apple gods would have mercy on us with such a valuable gift. I find that I'm having such feelings again today as rumors surface that Apple has at least made mockups of what iMessage might look like on Android, which means that it's possible that they've potentially entertained the idea. Honestly, when I think back on it I do wonder what happened to Google in the messaging department. When Hangouts first debuted, I was elated. I thought it was awesome, and I loved using it. I was happy that I could use it as my default SMS app on my Android, and that I could still access it when I switched to the iPhone, and furthermore use it from my computer. But at some point, mysteriously, Hangouts stagnated. Updates were slow, promises were broken, and the app became buggy and started lagging. Eventually, I moved on from Hangouts and found other options that worked better. When I use an iOS device, iMessage always feels polished. iMessage has consistently worked and performed well. From iOS 5 to iOS 10, iMessage is still going stronger than ever. On the other end of the spectrum, I find that I'm not very happy with my Android messaging experience. My most recent switch to the Galaxy S7 back in May was particularly eye-opening to this issue as I struggled to find something I was happy with. I didn‚Äôt like Samsung‚Äôs stock messaging app. Hangouts wasn't any better, particularly now that Google appeared to be taking away more than it was giving. Not without options, as Android has a ton of third-party messengers available, I eventually settled on an app called Textra. Textra is a nice app, but I don‚Äôt find it to be nearly as useful as iMessage. Soon after my switch to the S7, Google announced that they were working on another new messaging app. Two, actually: Allo and Duo. While I found some of Allo and Duo‚Äôs features appealing, there were ultimately more things wrong with the apps than there were right. Take for instance the fact that they‚Äôre two separate apps. The concept of the two being separated takes away from convenience. Truly, though, my biggest problem is with Allo. Without proper SMS support, it‚Äôs useless to me aside from the Google Assistant, which is actually pretty cool. I‚Äôm done campaigning for Google‚Äôs latest and greatest messaging system. There's no trust that Google is going to maintain this one when it couldn‚Äôt maintain all of the others, and people are tired of buying into the hype. It‚Äôs either polished and then integrated on every Android device with SMS support, or it‚Äôs just not happening. Again. iMessage, on the other hand, already has the potential to hit it big with U.S. smartphone users. iMessage is a solid messaging platform that I would feel confident recruiting friends to use. Why? Because Apple has shown for the past 5 years that it‚Äôs committed to iMessage, and only iMessage. Unfortunately, Apple has also shown that it‚Äôs also committed to keeping iMessage on the iPhone, and understandably so. iMessage is often vocalized as being the main reason that many people stick with the iPhone. Still, I think that bringing iMessage to Android would build Apple's reputation up more than anything else. Would some people take the opportunity to switch to Android if iMessage were available on it? Sure. But I don‚Äôt think people would switch in droves. It‚Äôs not like the iPhone‚Äôs only redeeming feature is iMessage; iPhones are great phones. Android has a vast selection of great phones too, but its messaging system is extremely fragmented. Apple could boost its reputation by providing this valuable service where Android is obviously struggling. iMessage on Android will probably always be a pipe dream, but occasionally a teeny, tiny sliver of hope pops up that makes me think it‚Äôs possible.

The software will live on top of the Apple TV streaming box, as well as an app on iOS devices, to let users easily search and find shows and movies across a wide variety of apps. The guide will sync with supported streaming services, supposedly with a single login, and offer recommendations. One notable exception to the list of supported partners is Netflix, which Recode reports is not currently involved. For some time now, Apple has had its sights set on TV as the next big platform it wants to reinvent. However, the economical and logistical compromises required to strike deals with large media companies has proved more difficult than Apple executive realized. That means Apple‚Äôs plan to try an offer a skinny package similar to Sling TV and Sony‚Äôs PlayStation Vue has remained stalled in the negotiation stage, with Apple VP Eddy Cue¬†unable to convince media conglomerates to allow Apple to do to TV what it did to music more than a decade ago. Apple wants to be at the center of people's TV viewing habits The next best thing, it seems, is a software overlay that effectively bypasses each individual company‚Äôs mobile app and over-the-top streaming service by treating a user‚Äôs subscriptions like a single library. That way, instead of traveling over to Hulu to watch The Daily Show or searching Netflix for Black Mirror, you would do so from Apple‚Äôs own guide. The company began putting in place the technical infrastructure for this plan in June during its WWDC conference, when it¬†announced a single sign-on option for tvOS so customers don't have to continuously plug in different usernames and passwords. It all sounds like a more powerful form of universal search, yet it‚Äôs not clear at the moment how it will differ from the search option on Amazon‚Äôs Fire streaming devices. It‚Äôs also unclear why Netflix hasn‚Äôt offered its support, given how Netflix has in the past been a partner with Apple on Siri integration and other features. We‚Äôll know more tomorrow when Apple reportedly shows it off during its Mac event. For more information, tune in tomorrow at 1PM ET/10AM PT to¬†check out The Verge‚Äôs live blog and all the day's news and announcements from Cupertino.

As Windows 10 hits its stride‚Ä¶ You OK, Apple? As Windows 10 hits its stride, MacOS is wheezing By Matt Smith ‚Äî October 26, 2016 3:16 PM Subscribe to this topic Aaron Cassara/Digital Trends On June 10, 2013, Apple announced OS X 10.9 Mavericks, and for a moment it seemed the company was on the verge of using its success in smartphones and tablets to make Mac OS X the best desktop option. Unlike previous updates, Mavericks was free. It was also released just a year after OS X 10.8, and marked the beginning of a yearly update cadence. Microsoft, meanwhile, was struggling with Windows 8. The Windows 8.1 update was still underway, and wouldn‚Äôt be released until October 18 of 2013. Apple was moving quickly, nimbly, while the old-fashioned Redmond behemoth stumbled along. My, what a difference a few years can make. Everything you can do, I‚Äôve already done I‚Äôve already written about my disappointment with MacOS Sierra. The operating system‚Äôs headline feature, Siri, does something that Windows 10 has done since release ‚Äì in a more limited, more confusing fashion. With Windows 10, Microsoft laid a solid foundation, one that simply exceeds the capability of MacOS. Microsoft didn‚Äôt talk much about its digital assistant at its October 26 event, because it didn‚Äôt have to. Cortana has been around for some time. Nor did the company speak at all about many of the features that make Windows 10 great. We heard only a little bit about notifications, and nothing at all about the taskbar, multi-tasking, or the start menu. And we didn‚Äôt have to. With Windows 10, Microsoft laid a solid foundation, one that simply exceeds the capability of MacOS. Putting that in place has allowed Windows to add capabilities that most of us never imagined we‚Äôd want. Pushing boundaries Touch is, of course, a key example. The mess that was Windows 8 convinced the world that touch is useless on the PC. But Microsoft didn‚Äôt give up. It trudged on, and now it‚Äôs working on programs like Paint 3D, a stylus and touch-capable application that will be bundled into the Windows Creator Update, and will help people of any experience level start working directly with 3D models and content. Related: Microsoft unveils pricey but powerful Surface Book update, Surface Studio at NY event Is it a bit niche? Yes, it is. But it‚Äôs very useful to those who need it, or are interested in it. And it‚Äôs something that a Mac physically can‚Äôt do. Unless Apple surprises us with a touchscreen MacBook Pro tomorrow, only iOS will be able to answer. And that carries its own problems. Aaron Cassara/Digital Trends Aaron Cassara/Digital Trends Aaron Cassara/Digital Trends Aaron Cassara/Digital Trends Aaron Cassara/Digital Trends That‚Äôs just the beginning. Microsoft‚Äôs push towards 3D content creation in the Windows 10 Creators Update has an obvious goal, and that‚Äôs empowering augmented and virtual reality. Microsoft already told us that HoloLens compatibility is being built into Windows 10, a feature called Windows HoloGraphic. Now, we see that Microsoft is also considering how people will build content for an augmented or virtual reality experience. It‚Äôs Microsoft, not Apple, that‚Äôs building an ecosystem of hardware and software for augmented reality. Apple has not even touched that space. The Mac doesn‚Äôt work with virtual reality headsets, and most Macs aren‚Äôt fast enough to power them, anyway. Tim Cook has been praising the virtues of augmented reality on his interview circuit, but right now it‚Äôs Microsoft, not Apple, that‚Äôs building an ecosystem of hardware and software for it. Microsoft deserves a lot of credit. This is cutting-edge stuff. HoloLens has its problems, but it remains a unique proposition, even more so than virtual reality headsets. It‚Äôs like nothing we‚Äôve ever seen before. Yet, at the same time, it‚Äôs being built in a way that could make it broadly usable by many people, with a variety of hardware. That‚Äôs just smart. Gaming is kind of a big deal, guys Touch and augmented reality aren‚Äôt the only gaps in the Mac‚Äôs armor, though. Microsoft also took aim at another that, though it might seem trivial, has become a serious pain for anyone who likes the Mac. The Mac doesn‚Äôt have game. Apple just doesn‚Äôt seem to care. Though it bizarrely talks up the Apple TV as a game console replacement (come on, guys, really?) it neglects making basic updates to Mac‚Äôs OpenGL support. Instead, Apple has decided to lean on Metal, its own API. That makes it easier for app developers to bring in games from iOS. But those, to be frank, aren‚Äôt the games Mac owners crave. Aaron Cassara/Digital Trends The result is obvious. Back in 2010, over 8 percent of Steam gamers were using Mac OS X. Today, that market share has shrunk to a mere 3.5 percent. And it‚Äôs no wonder. Well over half the most popular games on Steam don‚Äôt support MacOS. Blizzard, meanwhile, for the first time and years opted not to support MacOS with Overwatch. The game‚Äôs director, Jeff Kaplan, was blunt about it. When Polygon asked him about the lack of support, he said ‚Äúwith the technology behind Macs and the way Overwatch runs it‚Äôs just too challenging for us at this point to support it.‚Äù Mac‚Äôs market share on Steam has collapsed to just 3.5 percent. Translation? Macs are slow and their API support is bad, so we didn‚Äôt do it. Microsoft, meanwhile, is on the bleeding age. Gaming was a key pillar of its Windows 10 Creators Edition announcement. Gamers can tap directly into Microsoft‚Äôs Xbox service to stream content, voice chat with friends, or create tournaments. And then there‚Äôs Minecraft, which is being used as not just a game, but also a content creation platform for kids. Apple can only dream of offering the same. That matters. People don‚Äôt want to buy separate computers for work and play. They want one that can do everything they need. A Windows 10 device can be that. A Mac? Not so much. Sprinting ahead So, Windows 10 has support for features MacOS hasn‚Äôt even teased, and can play games that the Mac simply can‚Äôt run. That‚Äôs not great for Apple. And the timing couldn‚Äôt be worse. Apple just released its big update. For most people ‚Äì those not in the beta program ‚Äì MacOS Sierra is barely more than a month old. That means the next update is almost a year away. Aaron Cassara/Digital Trends Windows 10‚Äôs Creators Update doesn‚Äôt have a release date yet, but it‚Äôs slated for ‚Äúearly 2017.‚Äù And you don‚Äôt even need to wait until then. If you join the Windows Insider program, you can expect to see many of the relevant updates trickle out over the next few months. Worse still for Apple, Microsoft is likely planning two major Windows 10 updates in 2017. That means MacOS 10.13 might be released alongside a second Windows 10 update. Where does the Mac go from here? There‚Äôs a saving grace. Apple has an event scheduled tomorrow. There we‚Äôll see new Mac hardware. I‚Äôm sure it will be good. In fact, it‚Äôll probably be better than the hardware Microsoft showed today. While imaginative, the Surface line can be a bit unwieldy in actual use, and has been plagued with bugs. But this isn‚Äôt a battle of hardware. It‚Äôs a battle of operating systems. If MacOS falls too far behind, then people won‚Äôt want to use it, no matter how good the new MacBook is. Related: Microsoft Surface Pro 4 review Perhaps Apple is okay with that. Mac is only 12 percent of the company, after all, and it‚Äôs be simpler for Apple if it could find some way to elevate iOS to replace the Mac, and indeed, the iPad Pro is already trying to do just that. That fact, however, isn‚Äôt going to bring peace of mind to Mac fans. Apple sorely needs to give its desktop operating system the attention it deserves. Today‚Äôs Microsoft is in finer form than ever in the company‚Äôs history, and its making Apple‚Äôs MacOS update pace ‚Äì which, just a few years ago, felt lightning quick ‚Äì is starting to feel sluggish.

I‚Äôm obviously someone who prefers Apple devices over Google devices, but this phone is so fascinating that I just had to try it. I should note that this isn‚Äôt a review ‚Äî if you want a review you should definitely check out Stephen‚Äôs review over at 9to5Google ‚Äî these are first impressions from an iPhone fan. Considering that the Pixel¬†is the first real Google-branded smartphone, one that‚Äôs obviously meant to go toe-to-toe with Apple‚Äôs best offerings, I felt obligated to try it out. Here‚Äôs a brief look at a¬†dozen¬†of my initial thoughts. Unlimited full quality photo and video storage is awesome This is perhaps the Pixel‚Äôs most compelling feature: the ability to snap unlimited photos and videos, and simply not have to worry about cloud storage. As an iPhone user, iCloud Storage, or lack thereof, has to be one of the most frustrating elements of being in the iOS ecosystem. Google solves this issue by providing Pixel owners with unlimited cloud storage for photos and videos in full resolution. Apple could definitely learn something from Google‚Äôs approach here. No bloatware As an iPhone user, the concept of pre-installed bloatware is completely foreign (unless you count something like the Tips app), but people coming from Samsung phones and other Android OEMs will be happy to find a bloatware-free experience out of the box. The Pixel is as pure of an Android experience that one can come by, it‚Äôs running the latest version of Android Nougat, and will get a guaranteed¬†two years¬†of software updates and three years of security updates. If you‚Äôre looking for a Google touchstone device to compare to the iPhone, this is it. The Pixel is essentially Google‚Äôs ‚ÄúiPhone.‚Äù Hands-on with Google Pixel XL Subscribe to 9to5Mac on YouTube for more videos Google Assistant If the Pixel is Google‚Äôs iPhone, then Google Assistant is the MountainView company‚Äôs version of Siri. Backed by Google‚Äôs impressive machine learning, it‚Äôs fast, capable, and can do most of what Siri can do ‚Äî sometimes more. Stephen from 9to5Google summed it up well in his Pixel review: Think Apple‚Äôs Siri, but Assistant ‚Äî in my experience ‚Äî has far better word recognition and accuracy. And of course Google Assistant is powered by Google, so it has access to all kinds of information that Siri might not be able to grab for you. I definitely agree about the word recognition and accuracy. In my opinion, it‚Äôs what sets Google Assistant apart from Siri. Fast charging and battery Apple still ships its iPhones with wimpy 5w chargers that just barely get the job done. Google, on the other hand, ships the Pixel with an¬†18W charger, and features fast charging that will deliver¬†a considerable amount of battery¬†life in just 15 minutes. The 5.5‚Ä≥ iPhone 7 Plus ships with¬†a 2,900 mAh battery, while the 5.5‚Ä≥ Pixel XL comes with a substantially bigger 3,450 mAh battery. The smaller iPhone and Pixel feature 1,960 and¬†2,770 mAh batteries respectively. That means that the smaller Pixel has almost as much battery capacity as the larger iPhone 7 Plus, with just a 130 mAh difference. AMOLED display Although the iPhone 7 Plus‚Äô LCD screen is really good for an LCD display when it comes to contrast ratio, it still can‚Äôt compete with the inky black levels made possible by AMOLED displays. That said, the iPhone 7 display is brighter and is easier to read in direct sunlight. The Pixel features a higher resolution QHD display, but you‚Äôre probably not going to notice a difference between it and the iPhone 7 Plus‚Äô Full HD display when used as a phone. When used in Google‚Äôs upcoming Daydream View VR headset, however, the extra resolution will pay dividends. Photos and videos Photos taken with the Pixel in well-lit environments¬†look great and feature deep color saturation. The Pixel lacks OIS, but tries to make up for it with the so-called Electronic Image Stabilization for video. I found that EIS does a surprisingly good job of keeping 4K video nice and steady. The iPhone 7 Plus performs really well in low light environments, and the Pixel performed decently as well. I found that the Pixel‚Äôs photos featured more noise in low light conditions, which could be chalked up to the lack of OIS. The iPhone 7 also features a wider aperture, which help boost¬†its performance in low light conditions. One of the most impressive aspects of the Pixel‚Äôs camera is its autofocus capability. The Pixel‚Äôs autofocus is absurdly quick, and this is an area where I feel the iPhone can still stand to make some improvements. In most cases, however, the photo and video experience¬†was stellar for both devices. It‚Äôs easy to forget that you‚Äôre getting this level of photographic quality from¬†a smartphone. Design and build Although you won‚Äôt find any HTC markings on the phone‚Äôs box, packaging or exterior, the Pixel is a product of the Taiwanese company that has been branded as a ‚ÄúPhone by Google,‚Äù If you‚Äôve ever used an HTC 10, then there are some definite design cues that clue you in to the fact that the Pixel is made by HTC. The subtle chamfered edges on the front of the phone are a big giveaway, but other features, like the textured power button pay homage to classic HTC design. The front of the Pixel looks an awful lot¬†like the front of an iPhone or iPod touch sans Home button, but the rear of the device mostly heads in a different direction. The upper portion of the rear of the Pixel is comprised of a glass accent panel, and there‚Äôs a fingerprint sensor found there as well. Then there‚Äôs is the bezel, which is accompanied by an egregiously large chin. Why is it there? Why is it so ridiculously big? The iPhone at least has a Home button as a built-in excuse, but the Google Pixel‚Äôs chin is just a big, empty, boring space. The answer, it seems, is that Google used an already-in-the-works HTC product, because it had to rush out the phone in a mere nine months. Fingerprint Sensor (Pixel Imprint) Google calls its fingerprint sensor Pixel¬†Imprint. The sensor is located on the rear of the phone near the lower portion of the glass accent panel. The fingerprint sensor isn‚Äôt shared with a button, so it‚Äôs literally just a sensor and not much else. There is one cool ‚ÄúMove‚Äù feature that allows you to invoke the Notification Pane by swiping down on the sensor, but that‚Äôs about all as far as additional functionality is concerned. As someone with large hands and fingers, I‚Äôm not a huge fan of the placement of the sensor, as it requires me to adjust my grip slightly to interface with it. I do, however, appreciate how quickly the Pixel recognizes that your finger has been placed on the sensor, and how fast the phone unlocks. I‚Äôm also a big fan of the ability to set up multiple fingerprints during the initial phone setup process. Apple should give users the ability to configure multiple¬†Touch ID fingerprints during iOS‚Äô setup. Speaker After getting used to much-improved sound quality of the iPhone 7, listening to the single down-firing speaker on the Google Pixel seems like a big step backward.¬†The Pixel‚Äôs single speaker is loud, but you miss out on stereo sound and a front-firing speaker. Water resistance The Pixel is not water resistant like the iPhone 7 is. It features an IP53 rating, which is basically for protection against splashes and spills, not full submersion. The reason for this is, as noted above, that the team behind the Pixel simply ran out of time. Again, the Pixel was produced within a very tight nine-month time window, which¬†meant that some features, such as iPhone 7- like water resistance, had to be scrapped. That said, if this video is anything to go by, your Pixel will probably fare okay if it has a brief encounter with water. Pseudo-3D Touch 3D Touch really came¬†into its own in the latest generation of iPhones. It‚Äôs a feature that I dismissed when it first debuted, but I‚Äôve been using it constantly with the iPhone 7. The Pixel has its own pseudo-3D Touch, which is basically just a long-press, but it‚Äôs nothing compared to real force-sensitive 3D Touch with haptic feedback. I use 3D Touch all the time now, and it would be hard for me to adjust to using a phone without it. It would be like using a computer without right-click, although to a somewhat less drastic degree. Split Screen One of the cool things about Android Nougat is that it now supports native Split Screen mode. That means that apps that are designed to support the feature can be ran side by side in either portrait of landscape mode. On the larger 5.5‚Ä≥ Pixel XL, such a mode is very much appreciated. It‚Äôs a little cramped, but it‚Äôs nice to be able to keep up with your Twitter timeline and browse the web or watch a video at the same time. Conclusion The Pixel is a solid flagship smartphone that anyone deeply invested in the Google ecosystem should be proud of. It‚Äôs well designed, devoid of bloatware, and I should note that it‚Äôs also very fast. But it‚Äôs not a phone that would even make me think about switching from my iPhone 7. That‚Äôs not to say that that time will never come, it‚Äôs just that the Pixel isn‚Äôt yet that phone. This is only the first in a line of many Pixels, and I see Google significantly upping the ante now that its first white-labeled product has landed¬†to largely positive reviews. At $649+, the Pixel isn‚Äôt compelling enough¬†for curious iPhone owners to buy just to experiment with.¬†But future iterations may be able to snag fence-dwellers since Google will have more time to plan and develop future models. Keep in mind that these are just my impressions after going hands-on with the Google Pixel for a little over 24 hours.

This means¬†that those of us who already own an Apple Watch¬†can‚Äôt purchase these bands separately. Luckily, we were able to track down some Apple Watch bands¬†on Amazon that take inspiration from the¬†Nike band design. Obviously they¬†aren‚Äôt made with the same quality or¬†materials, but for those in search of alternatives, here are some good ones. Vitech Soft Silicone¬†Apple Watch band These soft silicon bands from Vitech are probably my favorite. They look a lot like the Nike+ Apple Watch bands, are available for both 38mm and 42mm¬†Watch sizes, and come in a multitude of colors. They are made of top quality TPU material and feature an innovative pin-and-tuck closure for a clean/safe fit. Unfortunately they aren‚Äôt¬†shipping until November and there aren‚Äôt any user reviews to go off of‚ÄîVitech does, however, include a 12-month warranty. You can buy this¬†Vitech silicone Apple Watch band for $21. Lamshaw Soft Silicone Apple Watch Sport Strap This Lamshaw Apple Watch band is fairly similar to the above Vitech. It too comes in multiple colors, is available for both 38mm and 42mm models, and is made of top quality TPU. As a plus, depending on which version of the band you choose, Lamshaw has some inventory ready to ship immediately. You can buy this Lamshaw silicon Apple Watch sport band for $19. EloBeth Sport Replacement Strap for Apple Watch I‚Äôm not familiar with the brand EloBeth, but a quick search reveals a¬†number of accessories listed on Amazon‚Äîincluding many Apple Watch bands with 4 and 5 star ratings. It claims their¬†Sport Replacement Strap is made from the same¬†fluoroelastomer Apple uses and it features the familiar molded perforations as the Nike+ band. Comes in multiple sizes and colors, but doesn‚Äôt ship until November. You can buy the EloBeth Apple Watch sport replacement strap for $19. X4-TECH Soft Silicone¬†Apple Watch Sport Strap This band from X4-Tech probably looks the least like Apple‚Äôs Nike+ band, but it‚Äôs close enough that it‚Äôs worth mentioning. And for what it‚Äôs worth it does have a 5-star rating based on a handful of¬†early reviews. Features include quick release pins that make it easy to assemble and remove, and an adjustable buckle for secure fit. Available in multiple colors and for both 38mm and 42mm models. You can buy this X4-TECH soft silicon Apple Watch band for $20. OULUOQI Apple Watch Soft Silicone Sport Band Ouluoqi is a well-known name in the low-end, third-party watch band space. They typically offer solid products backed with an 18-month warranty where they will replace a bad with quality-related issues. This particular model looks a lot like Apple‚Äôs Nike+ band, and is available for both 38mm and 42mm Watch models. You can buy this¬†Ouluoqi Apple Watch silicon band for $20.

(AP Photo/Richard Drew) Share Written by Dave Gershgorn October 26, 2016 For a firm that makes most of its money selling software and cloud services, Microsoft sure wants to look like a hardware company. Alongside new features for Windows 10, Microsoft execs spent more than an hour of the company‚Äôs event on Oct. 26 pitching new computers, VR headsets, and accessories focused on artists and designers. When it comes to Microsoft‚Äôs bottom line, hardware sales are just a drop in the bucket. And while niche-targeted products like creative-friendly desktops are unlikely to change that, new hardware puts the company right next to Apple in the headlines. They also paint a clear picture of the message Microsoft wants investors and consumers to hear: Macs are over, and PCs are once again for creative types. In a hardware landscape that has users living in fear of which port Apple will nix next, the strategy just might work. Surface Studio Today‚Äôs largest announcement was a 28‚Ä≥ 4K desktop PC called the Surface Studio. The Studio looks a lot like an angular iMac, except the computer‚Äôs touchscreen can swing down to rest on the desk at a 20-degree angle, which lets it function as a drawing tablet. The Studio screen works with the Surface Pen, as well as the new Surface Dial, a little knob that either sits alongside the computer to scroll through pen strokes or can be placed on the screen to bring up additional menus. Microsoft‚Äôs Surface Studio and Dial (Quartz/ Dave Gershgorn) Combined with a Pen and a Dial, Microsoft says Surface Studio is the best computer on the market for creative tasks. It‚Äôs being pitched at artists, architects, engineers, and anyone else who currently creates on the PC (or rather, anyone who makes a lot of money creating things on a PC, because the Studio starts at $2999). For that price, you‚Äôll get an Intel i5 processor, 8GB of RAM, and a 2GB Nvidia GPU. For Microsoft‚Äôs most powerful machine‚ÄîIntel i7 processor, 32GB of RAM, and 4GB GPU‚Äîyou‚Äôll have to shell out $4199. The Studios are available in limited quantities for pre-order, and will ship in mid-December. Let‚Äôs be honest: Nobody is buying this computer for its specs. It‚Äôs a beautiful machine that just might be functional, and it natively works with a stylus and navigation dial. Microsoft also announced an update to the Surface Book, which costs $2300 for increased battery life and 2x speed. Windows 10 Creators Edition It looks like Windows 10 really is the last version of Windows. Instead of dealing with hassle of a new software launch, Microsoft is releasing a free update to the world‚Äôs most popular operating system, dubbed the Creators Edition. It will be officially available in the spring, but beta releases are coming as early as next week. The update contains two big changes worth noting: a messaging overhaul, and 3D everything. With messaging, Microsoft has chosen to put people first in their redesign. Instead of opening an email client or Skype, you‚Äôll be able to pin individual people to the bottom taskbar. Clicking on them will bring up your preferred method of communicating with that person, making it easy to maintain multiple conversations and to quickly send files. Microsoft clearly has seen the success of Apple‚Äôs iMessage, and is also trying to imitate that. The Windows 10 update includes a new message-relay system that allows users to answer text messages from their Android or Windows phone, as Mac users can with iMessage. The update also gives a classic Windows program, Paint, a whole new look and skillset. The software, now named Paint 3D, will be able to create and manipulate 3D models, and integrate seamlessly with online repositories of models. Powerpoint will also be able to import 3D models, and transitions between slides can rotate and zoom to show different aspects of objects. This honestly looks pretty silly right now, and doesn‚Äôt make a lot of sense until you think about Microsoft‚Äôs long-term master plan: to lead the pack in VR and AR. Microsoft‚Äôs multiple realities The VR duopoly‚Äîa showdown between Oculus and Vive‚Äîis about to end. HP, Dell, Lenovo, Asus, and Acer will all begin producing VR headsets that don‚Äôt require any kind of exterior sensor to function, called inside-out positional tracking. All new headsets should have positional tracking. (Quartz/ Dave Gershgorn) One unspecified headset was shown on stage today, in a demo where a model created in Paint 3D was brought into a virtual room. Microsoft seems to imagine each user having a personal room or set of rooms, analogous to a desktop. In the demo, soccer played on one wall, while apps were located on another alongside a shelf of digital toys. The 3D models also can be viewed through the HoloLens, which was briefly trotted out on stage but not given much time. Microsoft did not announce any expected release dates for the VR headsets, nor did they give additional information about a consumer HoloLens release.

The Xiaomi Mi Max has an all-screen front side and a ceramic back, but the phone is labeled as a ‚Äúconcept‚Äù device. Xiaomi likely can‚Äôt make enough units to meet demand, and it probably announced the phone just so that it can one day say it beat Apple by more than a year with a device like this. Anyone following the smartphone business closely already knows that Apple‚Äôs iPhone 8 is expected¬†to feature new design with a screen that occupies most of the phone's front¬†side. But it turns out that Xiaomi‚Äôs Mi Mix phone looks a lot better on paper than in real life when it comes to that edgeless design. DON‚ÄôT MISS:¬†iPhone 7 vs. Pixel real-world speed test: The showdown we‚Äôve been waiting for Sure, any smartphone still has to have an edge to encapsulate the screen ‚Äî even if that edge is curved. And Xiaomi‚Äôs accomplishment here shouldn‚Äôt go unrecognized. But the fact remains that Xiaomi‚Äôs marketing images for the phone show a top and side bezels that are much¬†thinner in drawings than they are on¬†the actual product. Xiaomi is intentionally deceiving buyers. Anyone looking at the press images will expect something entirely different from¬†what he or she will¬†find in the box. Phone Arena‚Äôs comparison images show the differences between the advertised edge of the Mi Max and the bezels on the real product. xiaomi-mi-mix-bezel-thickness-2More xiaomi-mi-mix-bezel-thickness-1More Is Xiaomi taking its lead from Apple yet again?

Roston - Oct 26, 2016 2 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit If you can‚Äôt wait to get ahold of Apple‚Äôs newly unveiled AirPods, we‚Äôve got some bad news: the company has delayed their launching, citing a need to spend longer bringing them up to snuff. The exact reason for the delay isn‚Äôt clear, and could be more than any single thing. Regardless, don‚Äôt expect to get them this month. Apple didn‚Äôt state any sort of date or timeframe in which it plans to launch the product. 3.5 things to know about Apple‚Äôs AirPods The AirPods, of course, are Apple‚Äôs nifty looking and somewhat heavily mocked individual wireless earbuds, both of which exist separate from the other ‚Äî that is, there‚Äôs no tether between the two. The AirPods were announced the same time as Apple‚Äôs new iPhone 7, which notably lacks a headphone jack. Per a statement made to TechCrunch, Apple won‚Äôt be releasing the AirPods when originally anticipated, instead delaying them an indefinite amount of time. An Apple spokesperson said, ‚ÄúThe early response to AirPods has been incredible. We don‚Äôt believe in shipping a product before it‚Äôs ready, and we need a little more time before AirPods are ready for our customers.‚Äù This leaves everyone to speculate why they were delayed, though there‚Äôs no reason or even indication at this point, and so little reason to make assumptions. We‚Äôve already taken the AirPods for a spin, so if you haven‚Äôt already, be sure to check out our hands-on to find out what the earbuds have to offer, and to see a gallery of both the AirPods and their case/charger.

In a letter penned to Apple CEO Tim Cook, 26 elected officials, including borough president Ruben Diaz, have made it known that they want in (h/t Metro). "[O]ur borough is the only one without a single Apple store," the letter states. "Few brands are as recognized and admired as Apple, and an ‚ÄòApple Bronx‚Äô location would be another signal to the world that the Bronx is open for business," it continues. The letter doesn‚Äôt explicitly spell out where this "Apple Bronx" should be stationed but it does go on to mention the vast amount of development that the borough has seen in the last seven years alone. "Since 2009 the Bronx has seen more than $9.493 million in total development in all categories, and 54 million square feet of new construction." They point to the recent opening of the Mall at Bay Plaza, the Hub/3rdAvenue, and construction at Fordham Road for further proof that the Bronx is worthy of Tim Cook‚Äôs consideration. Additionally, it points out that many Bronx residents are loyal Apple consumers and deserve to have an outpost in their own community. On its final note, the officials highlight that bringing an Apple store to the Bronx would not only offer residents new retail opportunities but would create jobs for the community before declaring "It is time for The Bronx to get its bite of the Apple!" in its final sentence.

Photograph: Stephen Lam/Getty Images Associated Press Wednesday 26 October 2016 19.02¬†EDT Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Apple says it needs ‚Äúa little more time‚Äù before it starts selling the new wireless ear buds that are designed to work with its newest iPhones ‚Äì the ones that don‚Äôt come with a dedicated headphone jack. The technology company showed off what it calls ‚ÄúAirPods‚Äù last month during a launch event for the iPhone 7 smartphones. The iPhones went on sale in late September, and Apple had said the AirPods would go on sale in late October. But now the Cupertino, California company isn‚Äôt saying when they‚Äôll be released, or why it needs more time. iPhone users can still listen to audio on the new iPhones by using other wireless headsets or plugging into the phone‚Äôs charging port, although older headsets may need a plug adapter. At launch, Apple‚Äôs senior vice-president of marketing Phil Schiller declared the headphone jack to be ‚Äúancient‚Äù technology and promised that the earpods would deliver a ‚Äúmagical experience‚Äù. ‚ÄúIt makes no sense to tether ourselves with cables to our mobile devices,‚Äù he said, discretely acknowledging criticism at the removal of the headphone port by saying that it took ‚Äúcourage‚Äù for Apple to ‚Äúmove on to do something that betters all of us‚Äù. Apple‚Äôs decision was widely debated by users, many of whom felt that wireless headphones were less convenient and practical than their wired counterparts. Wireless headphones need regular charging and the tiny AirPods could fall out and, without the wire as a lifeline, easily get lost. At the same time, those wanting to continue to use their old headphones can do so using a free adapter that plugs into the iPhone‚Äôs Lightning port, although that does mean the user can‚Äôt listen to music or podcasts while the device is charging. Tech analyst Paul Erickson at IHS Technology suggested that the decision to remove the headphone jack was motivated by money. ‚ÄúIt should be noted that wireless models are the highest revenue-generating products within the headphone market,‚Äù he told the Financial Times. The decision to delay the launch of the ‚Äúmagical‚Äù $159 wireless headphones comes the day after Apple reported its first decline in annual sales and profit in 15 years.

Some fans are apparently buying kits online to mask older models in new iPhone garb. James Martin/CNET Why buy a new iPhone when you can dress your old one to look like the 7? 0 Share: Mobile by Gordon Gottsegen October 26, 2016 1:54 PM PDT Up Next Fantastic Beasts' Dan Fogler sees magic in tech If you couldn't justify spending the money to replace your old iPhone with an iPhone 7, you're not alone. And if you feel somewhat left out because of it, you're also not alone. Giving your old phones an iPhone 7 makeover is reportedly on the rise in China. Are you jealous of that jet black, but not jealous enough to buy the real thing?Photo by Sarah Tew/CNET The trend, first reported by Reuters, sees iPhone loyalists turning to online makeover kits and services to make their phones look new. Apple products are expensive in China, where Apple still struggles to break into the mainstream amid a multitude of cheaper competitors. A new black 128GB iPhone 7 costs about 7,094 yuan including VAT and other taxes, which roughly equates to $1,050. The same model would sell for $749 from the US Apple store. A quick search on Chinese online retailer Taobao shows stock for fake, unauthorized casings you can fit over an old phone to give it the appearance of the latest Apple phone, and other iPhone 7 lookalike products. For example, you can buy a fake jet-black iPhone 7 display model for 25 yuan, and potentially swap out the casing for much less. Apple did not respond to CNET's request for comment. There are a few ways to read the trend. One is Reuters' way, which suggests lower sales as a result of this tactic. On the other hand, putting in the effort to disguise a phone as an iPhone 7 proves customers' brand loyalty and props up Apple as a status symbol. Besides, not all consumers upgrade their phones every year. In skipping a generation, Apple customers could be holding out for next year's release.

The latest iPhone 8 rumors suggest you‚Äôll have three brand new handsets to choose from in 2017. Next year marks the 10th anniversary of the iPhone, and after a lackluster response to the iPhone 7 and sales that might not have lived up to the company‚Äôs expectations, reports suggest that Apple is planning a complete redesign of its iconic smartphone. The iPhone 8 will be available in models with 5.5-inch, 5-inch, and 4.7-inch screens, according to the Nikkei Asian Review. Each of the iPhone handsets will reportedly have glass backs in addition to glass fronts. The report suggests that Chinese companies Biel Crystal Manufactory and Lens Technology will make the new iPhone, which could signal that Apple is shifting away from having Foxconn as its main phone manufacturer. However, Nikkei‚Äôs source suggested that these are early plans, and things might change. Report says iPhone 8 will come in three sizes, all with glass backs: Now that the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus are out‚Ä¶ https://t.co/mUg1BuM46M ‚Äî Bazinga! (@technocturnal) October 26, 2016 Rumors have swirled for some time that Apple was planning a major overhaul of the iPhone in 2017 to celebrate the smartphone‚Äôs decade of existence. The company might have further impetus to make major changes to the iPhone after posting its first decline in sales since 2001, as the Inquisitr reported. The iPhone 7, which Apple released in September, was widely criticized for being too similar to previous versions and not having enough fresh features. The main difference between iPhone 7 and previous versions of the iPhone was the inclusion of a second rear-facing camera lens, but Apple only adopted that in the iPhone 7 Plus. There‚Äôs further motivation for Apple to create an iPhone 8 that really captures the customers‚Äô attention as phone owners start to shift away from Samsung. The Android smartphone manufacturer has had a terrible last few months after many reports of Galaxy Note 7 handsets exploding or catching fire, leading to Samsung issuing a mass recall and deciding to stop making those phones altogether. This iPhone skin transforms your phone into an exploded Galaxy Note 7 https://t.co/MRTSeMAZSD pic.twitter.com/0xjSNkbSWJ ‚Äî Gizmodo (@Gizmodo) October 25, 2016 That means there could be a lot of people looking for a new phone over the next year, and more Android fans willing to make the switch to iPhone. That is, as long as Apple can deliver enough incentive for them to make the switch with a more exciting iPhone than it‚Äôs offered recently. Previous rumors suggested that the 5.5-inch iPhone 8 will have a curved OLED (organic light-emitting diode) display while the other two will remain with the polysilicon panels that the iPhone 7 uses. It‚Äôs also possible that the iPhone 8 will take advantage of wireless charging, a feature that many Android manufacturers have had in their phones for years. A glossy design is something that Apple had already experimented with in the jet-black iPhone 7 Plus. Customers have had difficulty obtaining one of that particular iPhone models as it has been in short supply. That could suggest that a glossy iPhone design is something Apple fans are looking for, especially since it‚Äôs available in many Samsung phones. #ICYMI: The iPhone 8 could pair with mixed reality glasses, according to @Scobleizer https://t.co/lAm0tRYD1N by @pasha_spider pic.twitter.com/yX8QZxNMe3 ‚Äî Geektime (@geektime) October 26, 2016 A glossy iPhone design could have a second purpose beyond the merely aesthetic, according to Robert Scoble, UploadVR‚Äôs entrepreneur-in-residence. He suggested that a clear glass iPhone might include eye sensors that could combine with a virtual reality headset and project holograms into the real world much like the Microsoft Hololens does. Scoble also claimed that Apple would hide the battery and antennas around the edges of the iPhone 8 screen. Virtual reality and augmented reality have to be in consideration for Apple when Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, Google Cardboard, Samsung Gear VR, and Sony Playstation VR have all struggled to sell more than a million units, according to Scoble, meaning that there are a lot of people Apple can reach with its own VR or AR efforts in the next iPhone. In any case, it appears the mill of iPhone 8 rumors will keep on churning until Apple announces its next set of smartphones, which will probably take place next September.

AirPod wireless headphones during an event in San Francisco on Sept. 7, 2016. Photographer: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg Apple Inc. announced that its anticipated AirPods, a pair of wireless headphones, will no longer ship this month as planned. The AirPods were introduced in September alongside the iPhone 7, which was designed without a standard headphone jack. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt believe in shipping a product before it‚Äôs ready, and we need a little more time before AirPods are ready for our customers,‚Äù Trudy Muller, an Apple spokeswoman, said Wednesday. Apple didn‚Äôt provide a technical reason for the delay nor a new shipping date. The delay comes on the eve of Apple‚Äôs scheduled Thursday event for its updated Mac computer line, when the AirPods‚Äô availability also was expected to be announced. The AirPods delay is the first hardware-related postponement in more than five years from the Cupertino, California-based company. A version of the iPhone 4 in the color white was announced in June 2010, but didn‚Äôt ship to customers until April 2011 because of a production problem. On the software side, Apple delayed the release of iTunes 11 in 2012 by a month to fix bugs. Reviews of pre-production models of the AirPods suggested the device needed fine-tuning. ‚ÄúDuring my testing one of the AirPods had trouble holding a charge, so Apple swapped it out,‚Äù Walt Mossberg, of the technology website The Verge, wrote in September. Other reviewers noticed problems with music playback, a key feature of the AirPods. The introduction of the product spurred criticism that the cordless earphones could easily be lost. Comedian Conan O‚ÄôBrien mocked the device with a spoof of an iPod ad that showed people dancing and the AirPods flying out their ears into a sewage drain. The device is planned as part of a growing number of accessories that work around Apple‚Äôs most important product, the iPhone. Chief Design Officer Jony Ive last month referred to the AirPods as the start of a new wireless future for the company. The $159 accessory comes with a charging case that doubles as a mechanism to initially pair the headphones to the iPhone. With iCloud, the AirPods can automatically be matched with other Apple devices like computers and watches. Watch Next: Will Apple Alienate Users With AirPods? Will Apple Alienate Users With AirPods?

(Credit: Stephen Lam/Getty Images) This won‚Äôt be music to the ears of Apple fans. The company is delaying the launch of AirPods, its wireless earbuds designed for the iPhone. Apple, which first showed off the accessory in September, said on Wednesday it‚Äôs not quite ready for prime time. The news comes just one day before Apple‚Äôs MacBook event in San Francisco, where it was widely believed the AirPods would get a launch date. ‚ÄúThe early response to AirPods has been incredible,‚Äù a spokeswoman for Apple said in a statement to CNNMoney. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt believe in shipping a product before it‚Äôs ready, and we need a little more time before AirPods are ready for our customers.‚Äù The AirPods ($159) look like classic white EarPods but connect to products without a cord. With the removal of the headphone jack on the new iPhone 7 smartphones, Apple is pushing the AirPods as the future of wireless earbuds. The technology features a built-in microphone for Siri voice commands and phone calls, with sensors that know when they‚Äôre inside your ears. Apple declined to elaborate on why it needs more time. But perhaps we‚Äôll learn more on stage at its Mac event on Thursday. 37.774929 -122.419416 Filed in: Nation/World Topics: airpods, apple Suggest a correction √ó Suggest A Correction Your name Your email Report a typo or grammatical error Cancel Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn Pinterest Email KTLA 5 News on¬†Twitter Popular Protesters March Through Los Angeles in Fourth Night of Anti-Trump¬†Demonstrations Security Cameras Capture Anaheim Mother and 2-Year-Old Son Attacked by 2¬†Dogs Ku Klux Klan to Hold Donald Trump Victory Parade in North¬†Carolina Last-Ditch Effort Underway to Elect Hillary Clinton, Block Donald Trump¬†Presidency Latest News Businessman E.J.

Daily Deals: Amazon Echo $120, 23-inch HP display $87, and more ¬† skip to main content skip to main menu ¬† ¬† How to use Live Tune-In feature on Apple TV By Christian Zibreg, Oct 26, 2016 Tweet 2 Comments The fourth-generation Apple TV allows you to begin¬†watching a live channel immediately, simply by asking Siri. Called Live Tune-In, this feature works with supported video-streaming apps that provide live TV functionality. With it, you can quickly pop into a live news broadcast on CNN or a live game on ESPN without manually launching apps or¬†navigating¬†menus. In other words, Live Tune-In makes your Apple TV behave¬†more like a conventional TV.¬†Telling Siri to go to a live channel couldn‚Äôt be easier, as this quick tutorial attests. Live Tune-In system requirements Live Tune-In requires the following: 4th generation Apple TV with Siri Remote or the free¬†Apple TV Remote app tvOS 9.2 or¬†greater US App Store account Internet connection Video-streaming apps that feature built-in support for Live Tune-In In order to use Live Tune-In with a¬†compatible live-streaming app, you¬†must already be subscribed to the service in question.¬†As you can see on the screenshot below, tvOS 9.2‚Äôs ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs New‚Äù splash screen promoted Live Tune-In. tvOS 9.2 was released in March 2016. Live Tune-In is available in the United States only. Using Live Tune-In in an unsupported country Readers who don‚Äôt live in U.S. may be able to use¬†Live Tune-In if¬†they‚Äôre logged in to the tvOS App Store with a U.S. account and set regional settings on their Apple TV to ‚ÄúUnited States‚Äù and Siri settings to ‚ÄúEnglish (United States‚Äù). How does Live Tune-In work? A tvOS app that offers 24/7 streams based on HTTP Live Streaming and FairPlay Streaming‚Äîregardless of whether they‚Äôre available for free to all users or with paid¬†subscriptions‚Äîcan optionally offer Live Tune-In functionality. Assuming a developer has implemented support for Live Tune-In in their app, a user can invoke Siri and simply say aloud what channel they‚Äôd¬†like¬†to watch live. How to use Live Tune-In This is how you can jump straight into the live TV feeds of select apps. 1) Press and hold the Siri button on your Siri Remote or tap the Siri icon in the Apple TV Remote app on your iOS device, then say: ‚ÄúWatch [APP NAME] live‚Äù. 2) Let go of the button. For example, if you have CBS app on your device you would simply say ‚ÄúWatch CBS live‚Äù to start watching their live TV programming, as shown below. Or maybe you installed ESPN‚Äôs Apple TV app and wanted to jump straight to their live feed? In that case, you‚Äôd tell Siri that you wanted to ‚ÄúWatch ESPN live‚Äù. To confirm¬†that the video currently being watched is a live broadcast, swipe down on the Siri Remote‚Äôs Touch surface to reveal a menu at the top, then highlight the Info option. You should see ‚ÄúLive‚Äù in the menu if the video is a live broadcast. Notable apps that support Live Tune-In As mentioned, video-streaming apps that contain live feeds don‚Äôt automatically gain Live Tune-In functionality: developers must specifically implement the feature. At the time of this writing, the following apps supported Live Tune-In: ABC News CBS CBS News CNN Go Cooking Channel Disney Channel Disney Jr Disney XD DIY ESPN Food Network FXNOW HGTV Travel Channel Apple maintains¬†a regularly refreshed list of¬†Live Tune-In-compatible apps for the fourth-generation Apple TV in a support document on its website. Live streaming and Single Sign-On Keep in mind that in most cases live-streaming of premium video content requires signing in with your cable or satellite credentials, with the exception of services that offer online-only subscriptions, such as HBO NOW. Signing into multiple apps or authenticating by typing an alphanumeric code into a browser will soon become a thing of the past thanks to another Apple TV feature. They‚Äôre calling it Single Sign-On and it‚Äôs coming later this year. With it, you‚Äôll manage access credentials for video-streaming apps in one central location to have tvOS automatically sign you into apps that support Single Sign-On. The interface will display¬†a list¬†of¬†Single Sign-On apps based on your saved credentials and the tvOS App Store will promote and highlight them as well. Single Sign-On will be coming to the iPhone,¬†iPad and iPod touch in a future update, Apple has confirmed. Meet us in comments Have you used Live Tune-In yet? If so, what did you think of it? I use it¬†with CNN Go¬†and CBS All Access on a daily basis and¬†boy does a simple option¬†like this make a difference:¬†with¬†Live Tune-In, the¬†Apple TV feels more like a conventional TV¬†more than it ever has in the past.

TechShout Gadgets Software Hardware Mobile Phones Internet Apple Features Everything Else Home Apple MacBook Pro leaked images confirm Magic Toolbar Apple MacBook Pro leaked images confirm Magic Toolbar By Bindu Nair - Oct 26, 2016 The latest macOS Sierra update which came out recently holds a big surprise hidden within its depths, revealing a pair of images depicting a laptop which are very likely the highly-awaited revamped MacBook Pro. The fact that the photos were sourced from Apple itself definitely adds a layer of authenticity to the pictures. The accidental leak appears to confirm the presence of an OLED touch bar above the keyboard instead of the standard physical function keys. The innovative piece of hardware is apparently called the Magic Toolbar, in line with past Apple naming schemes like Magic Mouse, Magic Keyboard, and Magic Trackpad. Based on the images, the Magic Toolbar will present choices based on a user‚Äôs activities. An Apple Pay transaction can be seen on the main screen. Accordingly, the smaller screen displays options like cancel and asks the person to pay for their purchase using Touch ID. Also Read: New MacBooks coming out on Oct 27, iMac and 5K display in 2017 Touch ID appears to be integrated into a practically-invisible power button located at the end of the strip. Other than these cool new features, the redone MacBook Pro still looks similar to its predecessors in these photos. Noteworthy changes include speakers located along either side of the keyboard and smaller bezels. MacRumors thinks the laptop in the pictures is the 13-inch MacBook Pro and notes that the redesigned hinge could be a hint that the new device will be much thinner than before. Furthermore, the appearance of flatter keys could indicate that Apple is looking to adopt the Retina MacBook‚Äôs butterfly mechanism. Apple is expected to announce the new MacBook Pro and MacBook Air at a huge event on October 27.

Apple has a price advantage for now, but Microsoft's new product is well differentiated. Evan Niu (TMFNewCow) Oct 26, 2016 at 4:42PM Surface Studio. Image source: Microsoft. As expected, today¬†Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) unveiled a new all-in-one (AIO) Surface PC that looks exactly like the drawings from a patent application that Microsoft scored earlier this year. Dubbed Surface Studio, the company is hoping to challenge Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) flagship iMac 5K in the AIO market, and the Surface Studio is very much positioned for creativity. The new Windows 10 update focuses heavily on new features intended for the creative market. Let's see how Microsoft's new device stands up. Calling all creative professionals The big differentiator with Surface Studio is the built-in hinge that allows the display to articulate into different positions, primarily to allow users to draw on the display horizontally. That includes support for the Surface Pen stylus as well as a brand-new accessory that Microsoft is introducing called Surface Dial, which is a small puck-shaped knob that can be used either on the desk or directly on the display (compatible with other Surface devices as well). Here are just a few basic specs. Spec iMac 5K Surface Studio Display size (diagonal) 27-inch Retina Display 28-inch PixelSense Display Resolution 5,120 x 2,880 (218 PPI) 4,500 x 3,000 (192 PPI) Processor Intel sixth-generation Core i5 or i7 (Skylake) Intel sixth-generation Core i5 or i7 (Skylake) Touchscreen No Yes Operating system macOS Sierra Windows 10 Starting price $1,799 $2,999 Data sources: Company websites. PPI = pixels per inch. The biggest difference that stands out is the price point. Microsoft is asking quite a bit for Surface Studio at $2,999. So much that you could even say that Microsoft hopes to compete with Apple's Mac Pro professional desktop, which starts at the same price (except the Mac Pro doesn't come with a display or input devices). iMac 5K. Image source: Apple. This price difference is partially a function of time on the market. Apple first introduced the 5K version in 2014 and it started at $2,499. Like all tech gadgets, prices come down over time alongside costs, so Apple's price advantage is just because it moved first. While Apple aggressively targets the creative professional market in many ways, Surface Studio is making a compelling pitch to win over creative pros. The iPad Pros are Apple's products that allow stylus input and drawing, but a full-blown PC offers greater productivity. Overall, Surface Studio looks like a strong AIO PC, and it will only get stronger over time once prices inevitably come down. Microsoft continues to make progress with its Surface business. Revenue jumped 38% last quarter to nearly $920 million, which the company attributed largely to a higher mix of premium devices. Apple stopped breaking out Mac sales by laptops and desktops, but it did generate $5.7 billion in revenue last quarter in the overall Mac business. Even though Microsoft remains a small player in the global PC market in terms of units, it's definitely making a name for itself in quality hardware. Evan Niu, CFA owns shares of Apple.

This is a good thing, because the MacBook Pro lineup is in dire need of an update. Adding an OLED touch panel and a Touch ID sensor is a smart move, even if I am going to be left fidgeting for an Escape key for the rest of my life. But good or not, the MacBook Pro isn't the new laptop to get excited about. That would be the refreshed MacBook Air, which, like a tiny spoiled child before Christmas, I'm hoping appears under Santa Cook's tree tomorrow. DON'T MISS:¬†The iPhone 7 Plus Portrait Mode keeps screwing up I'll always have a soft spot for the MacBook Air. It was the first Apple laptop I owned, the first laptop I bought with my own money, and the much-needed replacement for an Acer laptop that got RMAed three times in four months. It seemed unrealistically thin to do any serious work, and way too fragile to survive falls. But even without discrete graphics, it flew through web browsers and Photoshop without stopping, or dying from low battery for that. Basically, it was the perfect laptop for everyone. Unfortunately, that Haswell i5-powered 2013 MacBook Air was the last Air to get any serious updates from Apple. For the last three years, Apple's engineers have begrudgingly shoved a new Intel processor in every year, but the rest of the specs have gone to hell. 12045227_10153727254528274_2552999612343239214_oMore Windows manufacturers are putting out laptops that are smaller, have bigger batteries, retina displays and zero bezel. In Air-town, we've still got a 1440 x 900 display surrounded by a small field of bezel and Apple's old-skool touchpad. The price hasn't even gone down, and I've started telling people to spend the tiny bit extra and buy a 13-inch Pro instead. But it really wouldn't take much to make the Air the king of laptops again. Shrink the chassis down so it¬†just¬†accommodates the new 1080p display you're going to fit, chuck in some USB-C ports for good measure, and don't dare touch my SD card reader or HDMI port. Do all of that, upgrade the guts, keep the price the same, and Apple will have a winner on its hands. I know, I know. Things have changed since 2013, and Apple wants people to buy the Retina MacBook. It's cute, but it costs $1,300 for a laptop with no ports and a slow processor. It's a great email machine, but it's not designed for serious work. You can't take it as your sole workstation for a month-long roadtrip, or live-blog an Apple keynote off it. Much as Apple wants to exist in one big Mac commerical where we all sail around on yachts posting iPhone photos to Flickr, lots of people need a work machine that isn't overpriced. Case in point: the growth of Chromebooks, which are outselling Macs recently. They're cheap, have USB ports, great battery life, and cost less than $1,000. You know what else fits into that category? The entry-level new MacBook Air that Apple's going to announce.

For anyone bemoaning the¬†demise of the 3.5mm headphone jack or wired technology in general, AirPods represent Apple‚Äôs high-tech solution to such complaints. Priced at $159, Apple‚Äôs AirPods were initially slated to launch sometime in late October. That said, Apple observers¬†were expecting the company to fill us in on the launch details during tomorrow‚Äôs Mac-themed media event. But as it turns out, anyone who was planning to get their hands on Apple‚Äôs AirPods this month will have to wait a little bit longer. DON‚ÄôT MISS:¬†This is going to be the first problem that 2016 MacBook Pro buyers need to fix Earlier today, Apple confirmed via a statement to TechCrunch that the AirPods launch is being delayed so that Apple can work out a few kinks. ‚ÄúThe early response to AirPods has been incredible,‚Äù an Apple spokesperson said. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt believe in shipping a product before it‚Äôs ready, and we need a little more time before AirPods are ready for our customers.‚Äù All in all, this is a pretty big bummer. I wasn‚Äôt planning on purchasing a pair but I was eager to try them out and see what the hype was about. Additionally, Apple‚Äôs AirPods are jam packed with all sorts of interesting and advanced technologies. As a quick example, each AirPod comes with an optical sensor that will only allow audio playback when the device is properly positioned in one‚Äôs ear. What‚Äôs more, a built-in accelerometer can detect when a user is speaking and, in turn, can filter out external noise focus more closely on transmitting the sound of the wearer‚Äôs voice. At the very least, hopefully Apple will provide some sort of launch update tomorrow during its special Mac event.

Posted 27 Oct 2016 05:10 Updated 27 Oct 2016 05:18 Traders on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, (Photo: AP/Richard Drew) Enlarge Caption¬† Email More A A NEW YORK: The Nasdaq retreated on Wednesday (Oct 26) after disappointing Apple earnings pulled down the broader tech sector, while strong Boeing results lifted the Dow. Apple dropped 2.3 per cent after fourth-quarter earnings tumbled 19 per cent to US$9 billion on lower iPhone sales. Amazon, Expedia and Google parent Alphabet all fell one per cent or more ahead of their earnings releases on Thursday. On the positive side, Boeing jumped 4.7 per cent after the aerospace giant reported higher third-quarter earnings and boosted its projection for 2016 commercial plane deliveries. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 30.06 points (0.17 per cent) to 18,199.33. The broad-based S&P 500 lost 3.73 points (0.17 per cent) at 2,139.43, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index sank 33.13 points (0.63 per cent) to 5,250.27. Companies in the S&P 500 have thus far in the quarterly reporting season shown on average 0.6 per cent higher earnings compared to the year-ago period, with 75 per cent beating expectations, according to Wells Fargo. However, it is still early, with more than three-fourths of S&P 500 companies yet to report. Coca-Cola finished down 0.3 per cent after third quarter profits fell less than expected, to US$1.05 billion in the quarter ended September 30 from US$1.45 billion a year earlier. Chipotle Mexican Grill sank 9.3 per cent as third quarter revenues slumped 14.8 per cent to US$1.0 billion, the latest sign of continued fallout from a series of food safety problems at the burrito chain. Big movers included Akamai Technologies, which surged nearly 15 per cent on strong growth in its cybersecurity business, while Edwards Lifesciences plummeted 17.0 per cent after reporting a sales miss for a key heart valve, despite a solid earnings report. Others with big moves following earnings included biotech company Biogen and food company Mondelez International, both of which gained 3.7 per cent, Southwest Airlines, which fell 8.5 per cent and oil-services company Weatherford International, which fell 6.8 per cent. Home improvement retailer Lowe's dropped 1.6 per cent after it was downgraded by both JPMorgan Chase and Wedbush. Oil prices fell again on Wednesday, despite a bigger-than-expected decline in US crude stocks. "The big thing today is oil and maybe some disappointment over Apple," Bill Lynch of Hinsdale Associates told AFP. "The prices of oil have been going down (and) it seems stocks were following oil, which has been the case lately." The US oil stocks report came days after key OPEC member Iraq said it should be exempted from the final production quota deal the cartel is negotiating as it was fighting a war against the Islamic State group. The market also reacted to fears that Russia might not take part in the planned deal to cap or cut crude production. "They say talk is cheap and OPEC appears to be approaching the limits of its ability to jawbone oil higher without something concrete to put on the table," Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at OANDA, said in a note. Crude prices had been in the ascendancy since last month when the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, and later Moscow, agreed to limit output in a bid to support prices. - AFP/ec Email More YOU MAY ALSO LIKE From Our Website From the Web Happening Now new window view more My Facebook Friends Back To Top JUMP TO Select Section Asia Pacific Singapore World Business Sport Entertainment Technology Health Lifestyle Videos Weather Photos Special Reports Archives Services PSI Navigate to: News TV Watch Live GET OUR APPS iPhone/iPad Android Get Our News Facebook Twitter Linkedin YouTube Mobile SMS eNews RSS News Asia Pacific World Sport Technology Lifestyle Photos Archives Singapore Business Entertainment Health Videos Special Reports TV Live News Schedule Shows Services Weather ADVERTISE WITH US Online Mobile TV Contact Sales Channel NewsAsia Channel News Asia About Us Coverage Hotel Partners Events & Seminars Presenters & Correspondents Contact Us Mediacorp Mediacorp News Group ¬© 2016 About Mediacorp Pte Ltd Terms and Conditions Privacy Policy Back To Top

Finance Search Tue, Nov 15, 2016, 11:33 AM AEDT - Australia Markets close in 4 hrs 27 mins Apple, oil weigh on global equitiesAFP¬†‚Äì¬†Wed, Oct 26, 2016 10:15 PM AEDT Recommend 0 Tweet 0 Share0 Print Related Content View Photo Hong Kong stocks jumped 1.2% in the afternoon on November 1, 2016, having retreated almost 3% in a five-day sell-off Sinking oil and falling Apple caused most world stock markets to retreat Wednesday, although strong Boeing results supported the Dow. In New York, the Nasdaq took a beating and the S&P was down as well, following declines for the bulk of Asia's stock markets and Europe's top indices. Apple -- the world's biggest company by market capitalization -- dropped 2.3 percent in US trading after fourth-quarter earnings tumbled 19 percent on lower iPhone sales. Amazon, Expedia and Google parent Alphabet all fell 1 percent or more ahead of their earnings releases Thursday. On the positive side, Boeing jumped 4.7 percent after the aerospace giant reported higher third quarter earnings and boosted its projection for 2016 commercial plane deliveries. Oil prices fell again Wednesday, despite a bigger-than-expected decline in US crude stocks. "The big thing today is oil and maybe some disappointment over Apple," Bill Lynch of Hinsdale Associates told AFP. "The prices of oil have been going down (and) it seems stocks were following oil, which has been the case lately." The US oil stocks report came days after key OPEC member Iraq said it should be exempted from the final production quota deal the cartel is negotiating as it was fighting a war against the Islamic State group. The market also reacted to fears that Russia might not take part in the planned deal to cap or cut crude production. "They say talk is cheap and OPEC appears to be approaching the limits of its ability to jawbone oil higher without something concrete to put on the table," Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at OANDA, said in a note. Crude prices had been in the ascendancy since last month when the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, and later Moscow, agreed to limit output in a bid to support prices. - Key figures around 2100 GMT - New York - Dow: UP 0.2 percent to 18,199.33 (close) New York - S&P: DOWN 0.2 percent to 2,139.43 (close) New York - NASDAQ: DOWN 0.6 percent to 5,250.27 (close) London - FTSE 100: DOWN 0.9 percent at 6,958.09 points (close) Frankfurt - DAX 30: DOWN 0.4 percent at 10,709.68 (close) Paris - CAC 40: DOWN 0.1 percent at 4,534.59 (close) EURO STOXX 50: DOWN 0.2 percent at 3,080.98 (close) Tokyo - Nikkei 225: UP 0.2 percent at 17,391.84 (close) Hong Kong - Hang Seng: DOWN 1.0 percent at 23,325.43 (close) Shanghai - Composite: DOWN 0.5 percent at 3,116.31 (close) Euro/dollar: UP to $1.0907 from $1.0887 Tuesday Dollar/yen: UP to 104.51 yen from 104.22 yen Pound/dollar: UP to $1.2242 from $1.2186 Euro/pound: DOWN to 89.09 pence from 89.34 pence Oil - West Texas Intermediate: DOWN 78 cents at $49.18 a barrel Oil - Brent North Sea: DOWN 81 cents at $49.98 @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook Top Stories ¬ª Sydney Airport gets new COOAAP Sydney Airport has appointed chief financial officer Hugh Wehby as the new chief operating officer from January¬†‚Ä¶ Trump to roll back Obama energy policiesAAP SEC Chair says to step down before term endsAFP German travel site trivago files for IPO in USAFP Sponsored ÓÇÄ Market Data Currencies Currencies Name Price Change % Chg AUD / USD 0.7571 +0.0016 +0.21% AUD/USD AUD / GBP 0.6048 +0.0004 +0.07% AUD/GBP AUD / EUR 0.7031 0.00 0.00% AUD/EUR Go To Currency Converter ¬ª On This Site HOME NEWS & OPINION TAX TIME 2016 INVESTING MY PORTFOLIOS PERSONAL FINANCE VIDEO Expert Opinion ALSO ON YAHOO7 Mail Stocks & Shares Forum Meet Single Women Meet Single Men TV Guide Easy Recipe Ideas Go Travelling Tips To Great Sex Breaking News Find Your Dream Car Weather Forecast Find A Job All Yahoo7 Services ¬ª Trending Now Budget Rent a Car Salim Mehajer Travel insurance Pasquale Barbaro Online car insurance quote Julian Assange Free iTunes download NZ earthquake Currency Converter Stephen Bannon Help / Suggestions Privacy Terms Quotes are real-time for NASDAQ, NYSE, and NYSEAmex when available.

U.S. stocks continue to slide early Wednesday, Oct. 26, 2016. Technology companies are taking some of the biggest losses as investors weren‚Äôt impressed with Apple‚Äôs latest results. Energy companies are falling with the price of oil. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig, File) Single page Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (1) New York ‚Ä¢ U.S. stocks dodged bigger losses and finished barely lower on Wednesday. Health care companies fell and Apple pulled technology companies down, but banks rose. Earlier in the day, stocks had appeared to be headed for a second day of notable losses, but they recovered some of that lost ground in late trading. Weak earnings for major companies hurt real estate investment trusts and health care companies. Tech stocks slid as investors were unimpressed with Apple's latest results. Banks continued to report strong earnings and Boeing boosted industrial companies. Stocks haven't made many big moves the last two weeks. "Trading volume has really dropped off," said Scott Wren, a senior global equity strategist at the Wells Fargo Investment Institute. He said investors are being cautious as they wait for the outcome of November's election. VIDEOS TOP JOBS The Dow Jones industrial average added 30.06 points, or 0.2 percent, to 18,199.33. In early trading it fell more than 100 points. The Standard & Poor's 500 index sank 3.73 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,139.43. The Nasdaq composite shed 33.13 points, or 0.6 percent, to 5,250.27. While individual companies might rise or fall based on their earnings, Wren said investors don't care that much if overall corporate profits rise or fall this quarter. Earnings have been falling for more than a year but the drops are getting smaller. "All the market wants in terms of earnings is a continuation of a pattern this year of quarter-to-quarter improvement," he said. Apple sank $2.66, or 2.2 percent, to $115.59 after it reported another drop in iPhone sales. Apple gets about two-thirds of its revenue from the iPhone and some investors are concerned it depends too much on its marquee product. The company expects sales to start growing again in the holiday season after a recent slump. The losses for Apple, by far the biggest company in the S&P 500, sent tech stocks lower. That canceled out big jumps in Akamai Technologies and Juniper Networks, which each surged more than 10 percent after strong results. Medical device maker Edwards Lifesciences reported disappointing sales of heart devices and forecast another shortfall in the current quarter, and its stock slid $19.43, or 17.1 percent, to $94.25. Medical lab operator Laboratory Corp. of America sank $11.95, or 8.6 percent, to $126.46 after a disappointing report. Drugmaker Merck gave up most of its gains from the previous day and fell $1.08, or 1.7 percent, to $60.87. Financial firms continued to report strong third-quarter results. Regional bank Huntington Bancshares gained 51 cents, or 5 percent, to $10.70 and insurer Chubb rose $4.55, or 3.7 percent, to $127. Boeing climbed $6.52, or 4.7 percent, to $145.54 after the company raised its forecast for earnings, revenue, and plane deliveries. Boeing was responsible for all of the Dow's gain. Simon Property Group, which owns more than 100 shopping malls around the country, slumped after analysts worried about its performance, including lower income from stores that have been open for more than a year. That counteracted solid earnings, and its stock fell $8.89, or 4.5 percent, to $188.38. Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 1.79 percent from 1.76 percent. Mondelez, the maker of Oreo cookies, Cadbury chocolate and Trident gum, climbed after reporting a bigger profit than analysts expected. The company's stock picked up $1.56, or 3.6 percent, to $44.32. Southwest Airlines slipped after it gave a weak revenue forecast for the rest of the year. Ticket prices have been falling for two years and Southwest said prices are still "soft." Its stock lost $3.55, or 8.5 percent, to $38.40, and other airlines including American and United also traded lower. The price of oil fell for the third day in a row. U.S. crude fell 78 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $49.18 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, lost 81 cents, to 1.6 percent, to $49.98 a barrel in London. Sales for Chipotle Mexican Grill fell for the fourth quarter in a row and came in weaker than analysts expected as the company continued to struggle in its efforts to win back customers after food safety scares. The stock lost $37.65, or 9.3 percent, to $368.02, its lowest price in three years. Drugmaker Mylan fell after Kaleo Pharmaceuticals said it will resume selling its emergency allergy shot Auvi-Q next year. That would mean more competition for Mylan's EpiPen. Auvi-Q was taken off the market last year because of the potential for inaccurate dosing, leaving EpiPen without any direct competition. ¬ª Next page...

India‚Äôs middle class is Tim Cook‚Äôs next frontier Written by Ananya Bhattacharya Obsession Messaging October 26, 2016 Quartz india Appealing to the India's growing middle class. (Press Trust of India via AP) Share Written by Ananya Bhattacharya Obsession Messaging October 26, 2016 Quartz india Apple is still awaiting its breakout moment in India, and much of its potential success hinges on the country‚Äôs middle class. ‚ÄúThe truth is, there‚Äôs going to be a lot of people in the middle class that will really want a smartphone, and I think we can compete well for some percentage of those,‚Äù Apple CEO Tim Cook said during an earnings call on Tuesday (Oct. 25). For now, Apple devices are still out of reach for a large chunk of India‚Äôs population. Even though the country is the world‚Äôs second-largest smartphone market‚Äîand the iPhone is extremely desirable there‚Äîits pricing remains a major deterrent. Nearly 70% of smartphone sales in India are in the under-$150 category. Even the iPhone‚Äôs cheapest iteration‚Äîthe Rs 39,000 ($493) iPhone SE‚Äî retails $158 above the average smartphone price in India. Apple also prices iPhones among the highest in India compared with other countries. To make matters worse for Cook, cheaper Android devices are capturing the majority of the Indian market, and Apple is losing its already-loose grip. The iOS market share almost halved in the second quarter of 2016, compared to the same period a year earlier. Even in China, which has long been a roaring success for Apple, revenues have been on a downslide this year. Beijing shuttered the company‚Äôs iBooks and iTunes movie stores and a local court ordered Apple to stop selling the iPhone 6 and 6-Plus because its design looked similar to a local phone. That pushback could be another reason Apple is looking at India as its next possible growth engine. But unlike China‚Äôs booming middle class, the percentage of people earning between $10-$20 a day in India has increased by only 2 percentage points between 2001 and 2011, to 3%. Companies in the region don‚Äôt offer monthly mobile plans or other phone subsidies, making it difficult for Apple to penetrate the market. A partnership announced on the earnings call could help with that. Reliance Jio, an LTE mobile network operator in India, is rolling out a ‚Äúfirst of its kind all-IP network‚Ä¶with 4G coverage in 18,000 cities and 200,000 villages across the country,‚Äù Apple chief financial officer Luca Maestri said during the call. They‚Äôre also offering a free year of service to purchasers of new iPhones. Apple has made other efforts, too. In a country where a third of all smartphone purchases are made on the internet, the company teamed up with Flipkart in September to sell its products online. And in May, Cook visited temples, met the bigwigs of Bollywood, and even watched a cricket match in an effort to curry favor. Two months later, Apple finally got permission to open its own retail locations in India in June‚Äîa request that had been turned down at least once before. ‚ÄúA lot of factors are moving in the right direction,‚Äù Cook said on the call today. ‚ÄúThere is a lot of headroom there in our mind, and so we are working very hard to realize that opportunity.‚Äù Read full story home our picks popular latest obsessions search

In 2.14pm trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average eked out a 0.03 percent advance. The Nasdaq Composite Index dropped 0.7 percent. In 2pm trading, the Standard & Poor‚Äôs 500 Index fell 0.3 percent. In the Dow gains in shares of Boeing and those of Nike, recently trading 4.2 percent and 1.9 percent higher respectively, offset slides in shares of Apple and those of Merck, down 3 percent and 2.2 percent respectively. While Apple‚Äôs latest quarterly earnings per share exceeded analysts expectations, analysts were disappointed with its outlook for iPhone sales‚Äîespecially given the rival Samsung‚Äôs woes. "In essence, in China and elsewhere, while Apple‚Äôs products are still seen favourably, the distance between Apple and its competitors is nowhere near as great as it once was," Neil Saunders, head of retail research firm Conlumino, wrote in a note, according to Reuters. The latest US economic data were better than anticipated. The US trade deficit shrank 5.2 percent to US$56.1 billion in September, bolstering hope that third-quarter GDP growth might beat expectations. ‚ÄúWe now believe the boost from trade could be closer to a full percentage point, almost twice what we had expected," Michelle Girard, chief economist at RBS in Stamford, Connecticut, told Reuters. Girard said she now predicts real GDP growth in the third quarter of 3.3 percent. Separately, a Commerce Department report showed new home sales rose 3.1 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 593,000 units in September, an unexpected gain. Mondelez International shares climbed, up 3.6 percent as of 1.35pm in New York, after the maker of Cadbury chocolate upgraded its full-year profit forecast. The company has increased its full-year adjusted earnings per share outlook and now expects growth of about 25 percent on a constant-currency basis, Mondelez said in a statement. "Our third quarter results underscore our continued commitment to improve operational efficiency, expand margins and profitably grow volume while also investing in strategic growth initiatives for the longer term," CEO Irene Rosenfeld said in the statement. ‚ÄúIn the face of challenging market conditions, we're building a stronger, more streamlined company that is well positioned to deliver sustainable, profitable growth and attractive cash generation,‚Äù Rosenfeld noted. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index finished the day with a 0.4 percent slide from the previous close. France‚Äôs CAC 40 Index slipped 0.1 percent, Germany‚Äôs DAX Index declined 0.4 percent lower, while the UK‚Äôs FTSE 100 Index shed 0.9 percent. Germany‚Äôs Bayer, which agreed to buy Monsanto in a US$66 billion deal, reported better-than-expected quarterly profit bolstered by its pharmaceutical unit. Even so, Bayer shares closed 1.4 percent lower in Frankfurt as investors were concerned about weakness in its Crop Science division. Pharmaceuticals posted ‚Äúencouraging‚Äù sales growth of 7.6 percent in the quarter, Consumer Health sales grew 3.6 percent, while sales of Crop Science were level year on year, Bayer said. ‚ÄúEarnings are not strong enough to fuel markets,‚Äù Ralf Zimmermann, an equity strategist at Bankhaus Lampe in Dusseldorf, Germany, told Bloomberg. ‚ÄúSome investors who had expected accelerating earnings may be disappointed.‚Äù (BusinessDesk) ¬© Scoop Media BusinessDesk Independent, Trustworthy New Zealand Business News The Wellington-based BusinessDesk team led by former Bloomberg Asian top editor Jonathan Underhill and Qantas Award-winning journalist and commentator Pattrick Smellie provides a daily news feed for a serious business audience.

The buds, which attempt to atone for the lack of a headphone jack in the iPhone 7, were announced in early September alongside this year‚Äôs handsets. Apple says fans are psyched about the new W1 chip-enabled audio accessories, but will be taking a ‚Äòlittle more time‚Äô to get them ready for prime time. Related: You're going to need 'courage' to wear Apple's AirPods In a statement released to TechCrunch, the company said: ‚ÄúThe early response to AirPods has been incredible. We don‚Äôt believe in shipping a product before it‚Äôs ready, and we need a little more time before AirPods are ready for our customers.‚Äù There is no further word on the reason for the delay. Since the announcement, the AirPods have received a mixed reception to say the least. They‚Äôve been derided for their toothbrush-like design as well as the proprietary W1 tech that means they won‚Äôt work with non-Apple products. They have also been criticised for their astonishing $159/¬£159 price-tag and their lose-ability, which can be offset by the inevitable launch of a neck strap. Some reviews have dubbed them ‚Äúlike wearing a toothbrush‚Äù while others have claimed they‚Äôre ‚Äújust as bad as you thought they‚Äôd be.‚Äù They've also been praised for the secure fit and the easy pairing with the iPhone 7.

The company has recruited at least two dozen engineers in Canada from BlackBerry Ltd.'s QNX, an automotive software provider, and has other newly hired software engineers working up north, unnamed sources claim. The engineers are reportedly working at one of Apple's offices in Kanata, a suburb in Ottawa, Ontario, which is just a few minutes away from QNX's headquarters. A former QNX executive claims Apple singled out the company's engineers because of their experience with developing vehicle operating systems, which makes perfect sense. Apple has poached from QNX in the past, having hired QNX's former CEO Dan Dodge in July. Dodge joined the company to help Bob Mansfield, who came on as the head of Project Titan earlier this summer. An anonymous source also claims that Apple recently hired Derrick Keefe, previously one of QNX's senior engineers. Among other thing, QNX develops software to allow automakers to integrate Apple CarPlay and Android Auto into infotainment systems. The software also offers connectivity, apps, and other features, and is widely used throughout the industry. Clearly, Apple knows who the experts are in the field and it is going after them.

And no, that last one wasn't a compliment. "Tesla supporters are like members of a religious cult," the former GM exec told CNBC's Squawk Box. "Just like Steve Jobs was worshiped at Apple, it's the same way with Elon Musk, who is seen as a new visionary god who promises this phantasmagorical future, a utopia of profitability and volume." Lutz with the set, and now the spike: "The only problem is, Steve Jobs delivered and Elon, God bless him, hasn't delivered a thing, except increasingly negative cash flow, and an increasing lack of profitability; more and more capital spending." Now, because we live in 2016, it's not hard to find talking heads that are actually talking out of a certain other part of their anatomy. But Lutz doubles down and explains just what he thinks is wrong with the belle of the automotive ball. "I just don't see anything about Tesla that gives me any confidence that that business can survive," Lutz said. But when asked whether he thinks Musk's company will go bankrupt, Lutz hedged his bet. "The last time I checked, [Tesla's] quarterly cash burn is about $250 million for a company that size, that's horrific." According to Lutz, "every time [Tesla] gets a $500 million injection from a new stock sale or a $750 million injection of new money, it lasts them two or three quarters. This is a problem that volume can't fix." Tesla's last cash injection came via a $1.7 billion stock sale in May that helped boost the company's cash position to $3.25 billion at the end of Q2. "If you're in a variable loss ‚Äì that is, you're not recovering labor and materials in your sale price ‚Äì then doing twice as many, or three times as many, or four times as many [sales] doesn't help. The losses just get bigger and bigger." In the interest of balance, it's worth noting an Electrek article published today refuting a number of Lutz's points. In particular, author Fred Lambert calls Lutz's claims about Tesla not recovering labor and material costs "simply not true." "Tesla has a positive gross margin on its vehicles for years now and as much as 20 percent for the past few quarters. That's without accounting for ZEV credits," Lambert writes. "Tesla is losing money on a quarterly basis, there's no doubt about that, but that's after its research-and-development investments and massive capital expenditures in its new assembly line for the Model 3 and investments in the Gigafactory, among other things," the Electrek story reads. "It's completely different from saying that they are losing money on vehicles because they are 'not recovering labor and materials,' which is materially untrue." Tesla just reported its earnings this afternoon, and the news was good. You can check out Lutz's bit on CNBC below. UPDATE: Elon has a sense of humor about it all.

We're not sure, but definitely not by the end of this month. Apple Apple's new wireless, $180 AirPods have less than a week to meet their original shipping target of "late October," and now the company has confirmed that such a¬†launch is officially off the table. A Wednesday statement, given to Ars Technica just one day ahead of the company's latest Mac-related press event, confirmed Apple's decision to delay the wireless headphones' launch. In the statement, Apple tells Ars that the company¬†"needs a little more time before AirPods are ready for our customers." "The early response to AirPods has been incredible," the Apple statement reads. "We¬†don't believe in shipping a product before it's ready." Apple declined to offer any estimate or release window information about when to expect the AirPods' official launch. We can only imagine that Apple wants "a little more time" to be somewhere within the next few weeks so that this holiday season's rabid iPhone 7 and 7 Plus shoppers can pony up for¬†wireless earbuds¬†for their¬†jack-less phones. Perhaps timing¬†information will appear on the product's official site soon; currently, it still reads "late October."

The design, operation and concept of this computer is basically a giant iPad, the iPad I always dreamed of. Microsoft‚Äôs new Surface family. (Surface Studio on left.) Image credit: Microsoft. I will be the first to admit that my fantasy for the ultimate computer may not be commercially viable. Even so, I‚Äôve always had this feeling that the iPad of the future would eventually be my work computer. It would be a descendant of my Mac Pro today and its 34-inch HP display. This future iPad would have a 36-inch (0.9 meter) display on a tilt so that I could rest my arms on the desk and create content, via touch and speech. No more ‚Äúgorilla arm‚Äù effect, something Steve Jobs was adverse to when it came to the idea of reaching out to touch screen Macs. When Apple inched along to a 12.9-inch iPad, I thought, maybe this would be the start of that progression. My fantasy has lately been¬†further ignited by this futuristic, fictional computer used in the 2011 TV series ‚ÄúTerra Nova.‚Äù My fantasy for a desktop computer since 2011. Image credit: Fox TV. That‚Äôs the design that has percolated in my brain for years. Make it So For a long time, I always felt that Steve Jobs had a technical vision that he forced down the chain. He knew what he wanted, and he made it happen. That was true for the iPod, Mac OS X in the early days, the iPhone and the iPad. These products were all commercially viable as well. Lately however, even though Apple is in a mature phase, generating a lot of revenue and earnings, there‚Äôs been a certain lack of technical excitement. As Kelly Guimont describes it, ‚ÄúNo MacBook Air pulled from the manilla envelope‚Äù moment. We have the same old iMacs and the same old MacBook Pros, and the same old iPads. Marry that with an agonizing delay (the past 500-1000 days) in the introduction of new Macs across the line, and one has the making of a serious technical vacuum created by Apple. I wrote about this first here: ‚ÄúHewlett-Packard Seeks to Exploit Apple‚Äôs Inattention to Technical Professionals.‚Äù Now, Microsoft is joining the fray, moving in aggressively to cater to the creative and technical professionals. This photo (below) of the Microsoft Surface Studio particularly ignited my interest and passions because it fulfills my own vision for how the next generation desktop computer should work. This freezeframe from the YouTube video told me everything I needed to know. Basically, Satya Nadella‚Äôs Microsoft has outsmarted a complacent Apple. Windows 10 None of this could have happened if Microsoft had a shoddy OS to put on its new computers. But Widows 10 has come a long way since the dreadful Windows XP and Windows 8. Microsoft learned from its mistakes. Today, a technical or creative professional can get serious work done with Windows 10, Windows apps, and the supporting business infrastructure and development tools provided by Microsoft. To be sure, I‚Äôd prefer Linux. And Xcode on an iMac is awesome, but what if your company is into Java or C++ for the enterprise? Apple has only itself to blame here for de-emphasizing the UNIX underpinnings of its macOS, going flat with real creativity across the product line, becoming complacent in the Mac upgrade cycle, and focusing to extremes on mobility. With sales¬†of both Macs and iPads declining, can Apple afford not to be the leader in every market? The Halo Effect Just as¬†car companies have Halo cars, computer companies need Halo computers. These are the very best money can buy. They inspire the customer base. They demonstrate what the company is capable of. The designs inform the thinking about less expensive computers in the lineup. I don‚Äôt know how financially successful Hewlett-Packard and Microsoft will be with the new products I‚Äôve written about, but it‚Äôs enough that they will have the attention and delight of the professional and creative market. These efforts suggest enthusiasm, attentiveness and, most of all, technical leadership. Apple has hereby been challenged. It will be interesting to see what the company shows us on October 27th. Will we be be dazzled? Will Apple reassert its leadership? We‚Äôll know soon.

I‚Äôll be very curious to see what Apple announces tomorrow, and am holding out jope that it‚Äôs more than just a new Macbook line. October 26, 2016 at 3:31 EST PM Jamie October 26, 2016 Oops. Pardon the typo. Also known as, ‚Äòhope‚Äô. üòâ October 26, 2016 at 3:32 EST PM Rick Allen October 26, 2016 The ‚ÄúI want it Now!‚Äù feeling is there with this computer. Could I use it to its full potential, I honestly don‚Äôt know. The surface book was the first Microsoft product I was really wanting to get my hands on, yet did not (I have a work Surface Pro 4). The Surface studio, is a new vision, original, and that is something amazing. October 26, 2016 at 3:45 EST PM NorthSaanichBC October 26, 2016 Let‚Äôs compare Microsoft‚Äôs iMac-killer to the year old 2015 iMac 27‚Äù 5K (which will be receiving a major update tomorrow). The Surface Studio has a lower resolution display than the iMac‚Äôs 5K display. It has a touch screen‚Ä¶ But do you really want a ‚ÄúGorilla Arm‚Äù inducing touch screen that large?: The Surface Studio starts at $2,999 for a configuration with a 6th-generation Intel Core i5 processor, 1TB of internal storage, 8GB of RAM and a 2GB GPU. Last year‚Äôs 2015 iMac with a similar configuration Intel Core i5 processor, 1TB of internal storage, 8GB of RAM and a 2GB GPU is $1,799 ($1,200 LESS) Meanwhile, the top-of-the-line Surface Studio costs $4,199, with a Core i7 processor, a 2TB storage disk, 32GB of RAM and a 4GB graphics card.‚Äù Last year‚Äôs 2015 iMac with a similar configuration of a 4.0GHz Core i7 processor, 2TB Fusion Drive, 32GB of RAM, and a 4GB graphics card is $3,399 ($800 LESS) Microsoft also updated their 13‚Äù Surface Book, which starts at $2,399. The 2015 13‚Äù MacBook Pro with Retina Display (which also will have a major update tomorrow) starts at $1,299. And TOMORROW we will see NEW Macs, with NEW pricing and options from Apple! Windows users who complain that Macs are ‚Äútoo expensive‚Äù need a ‚Äúreality check‚Äù, and to see how ludicrous that opinion really is. October 26, 2016 at 3:51 EST PM JonGl October 26, 2016 Last week I bought a Surface Pro 4, to see if I‚Äôd like it, or could at least live with it. Yeah, there are lots of niggling frustrations with the change, but most of my software is available on Windows, and what isn‚Äôt, I‚Äôve been able, so far, to find decent replacements‚Äìand yes, Win 10 is surprisingly usable. I‚Äôm loving the Surface capabilities, especially with some extra software‚Äìit is actually reminiscent of my Newton. We‚Äôll see what Apple introduces, to know if I‚Äôll be keeping it or not‚Äìbut the fact that I bought it days before Apple‚Äôs announcements should give an idea as to how much I‚Äôm holding out hope. üôÇ October 26, 2016 at 3:55 EST PM DaveNull October 26, 2016 NorthSaanichBC dismisses the Surface Studio based on specs and pricing. I thought that‚Äôs what Windows fanboys did when dismissing the Mac? It isn‚Äôt hard to figure out why the Surface Studio is expensive: A large, touch- and pen-enabled display with a non-standard aspect ratio was never going to be cheap. While Apple might be able to compete on the specs of the rest of the hardware, they don‚Äôt sell a product that can compete in functionality, and Microsoft knows it. Apple has been put on notice. October 26, 2016 at 4:29 EST PM ibuck October 26, 2016 @ Harvey L (@NorthSaanichBC) Windows users who complain that Macs are ‚Äútoo expensive‚Äù need a ‚Äúreality check‚Äù, and to see how ludicrous that opinion really is. And IBM‚Äôs IT guy says Macs are 3 times cheaper to own than Windows PCs. Despite all this, I‚Äôve lost hope too, as I sold some AAPL stock Monday. Product refreshes, except for iPhones, are very, very tardy, and it seems that Cook & company are spending tons of cash and the scarce time of their too few top-quality engineers on research for products that don‚Äôt come to market, like Apple car or Sapphire screens. And they brought back long-time Apple executive Bob Mansfield to say ‚ÄúNo‚Äù to the former. If Thursday‚Äôs offering are ‚Äúmeh,‚Äù hope will fade even more. October 26, 2016 at 4:43 EST PM KitsuneStudios October 26, 2016 This may well be my next computer. Apple‚Äôs limited ecosystem has been squeezing me out of MacOS market. I need a good graphics card, and Apple has nothing capable of using a high end desktop graphics card. My only choices are a top-end iMac or a Mac Pro. Given that, the Surface Studio is perfectly in line with what I‚Äôd expect to pay from Apple, and it includes a Cintiq. While I‚Äôll deeply miss the MacOS experience, I won‚Äôt miss it enough to make up for the benefits I‚Äôd get from either a cheap PC with a killer graphics card, or a Surface Studio. October 26, 2016 at 5:14 EST PM Lee Dronick October 26, 2016 I was comsidering my old MacBook pro with an iPad Pro, but after playing around with one I think that I will get a new MacBook. I am very anxious to see what is announced in the way of Macs tomorrow. October 26, 2016 at 6:53 EST PM furbies October 26, 2016 While the Surface Studio is a nice idea, I‚Äôm still not sold on the idea of a screen that collects fingerprints. Fingerprint buildup on an iPhone or iPad is unavoidable, but at least they‚Äôre not a large screen area to clean, and having a tempered glass screen protector avoids scratching the actual glass of the display. I wouldn‚Äôt be keen on trying to buy a tempered glass screen protector big enough to cover the Surface‚Äôs display area. (Cost & difficulty of application) October 26, 2016 at 7:25 EST PM shameermulji October 26, 2016 Hey John, I wouldn‚Äôt count out a desktop-class iPad just yet. Here is a patent that Apple was granted in 2010 http://www.patentlyapple.com/patently-apple/2010/08/the-mother-lode-welcome-to-the-imac-touch.html Maybe all the pieces aren‚Äôt ready yet like 1) a truly desktop-class Apple ARM SoC, 2) Apple Filesystem coming out of beta, 3) iOS needs to become more powerful (albeit not more macOS like) October 26, 2016 at 7:38 EST PM CudaBoy October 27, 2016 What Kitsune said. Also, nice typo ‚Äì ‚ÄúWidows‚Äù. Also, nice ad online for the Studio ‚Äì but I still said to myself ‚Äòbut it‚Äôs Windows‚Äô. That knee-jerk gives my old fashioned OS prejudice away. it would be nice if Apple throws us studio bums a bone for a change. October 27, 2016 at 2:27 EST AM jimtincher October 28, 2016 John, We‚Äôre pretty much on the same page. I‚Äôve never been a fan of Cook and was worried when he was announced as Jobs replacement. Why? Because he‚Äôs boring. Lets be real, the creative genius at Apple has always been Jobs and the creative think has always been a top down promulgation of ideas. That Microsoft is out innovating Apple should be a major wakeup call. Apple is no longer attracting the creatives, but is driving them away. Their choices with software apps started that trend and their hardware designs are finishing it. October 28, 2016 at 7:06 EST AM Paul Goodwin October 31, 2016 Ergonomically, the touch screen laptops and now all-in-ones are horrid devices. Look at the position of the woman and the screen. Her eyes aren‚Äôt anywhere near perpendicular to the screen, and if they were, her arms would be stretched out unless there were huge arm supports. Use one of those surface devices all day every day for years and you‚Äôll be a cripple. October 31, 2016 at 10:36 EST PM Add a Comment Click here to cancel reply.

Apple isn‚Äôt shipping its wireless earpods this month because they‚Äôre still not ready to go. Apple‚Äôs AirPods won‚Äôt ship in October Apple representatives told TechCrunch the AirPods are taking longer than expected to come together. The spokesperson said, ‚ÄúThe early response to AirPods has been incredible. We don‚Äôt believe in shipping a product before it‚Äôs ready, and we need a little more time before AirPods are ready for our customers.‚Äù Apple showed off AirPods at its September iPhone 7 launch event, and while the smartphone refresh made it to customers days later, the wireless earpods were tagged for a late October release. Now that we‚Äôre only days away from November, Apple is confirming we won‚Äôt see AirPods shipping this month. The preproduction units Apple shared with the media suffer from minor bugs and occasional connectivity issues. That seems to be enough to keep Apple from shipping, and as annoying as that may be, it‚Äôs the right choice. Apple is already facing criticism for the long gaps between Mac updates, and shipping buggy AirPods would be worse for the company‚Äôs reputation than shipping late. Apple isn‚Äôt saying when AirPods will ship. Regardless, it looks like hopefully shipping before Halloween is now maybe by Thanksgiving.

The ‚Äúimproved‚Äù shape of the Apple earbuds don‚Äôt fit my ears; apparently I am not average enough. While the technical engineering is impressive, I‚Äôll probably have to look elsewhere for more traditional wireless earbuds with the silicone tips. Fortunately for me, MacObserve has some reviews!

¬† Home U.K. News Sports U.S. Showbiz Australia Femail Health Science Money Video Travel Columnists Wires Home My Profile Logout Login Feedback DailyMail NEW ARTICLESHomeTop Share show ad Apple weighs on Wall St; oil, gold prices slip By Reuters Published: 16:51 EST, 26 October 2016 | Updated: 16:51 EST, 26 October 2016 e-mail By Hilary Russ NEW YORK, Oct 26 (Reuters) - Apple's results weighed on U.S. stock prices on Wednesday after the technology giant posted its first annual revenue decline since 2001, while oil and gold prices slipped. Apple, the world's largest company by market capitalization, fell 2.2 percent after it acknowledged strong demand for its iPhone 7 Plus caught the company off-guard and it was struggling to keep up with demand. The technology giant pulled down the S&P 500 stock index and Nasdaq, but gains in Boeing bouyed the price-weighted Dow Industrials. Boeing shares were trading at their highest level this year, after the world's largest planemaker reported a jump in quarterly profit despite slower sales. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 30.06 points, or 0.17 percent, to 18,199.33, the S&P 500 lost 3.73 points, or 0.17 percent, to 2,139.43 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 33.13 points, or 0.63 percent, to 5,250.27. Disappointing results and forecasts from some other major U.S. companies weighed on European and Asian stocks. Mixed results from Europe's banking sector and declines in mining and energy shares helped push the pan-European STOXX 600 index down 0.38 percent. Gold prices fell as investor appetite for riskier assets recovered slightly, denting demand for safe-haven bullion. Spot gold fell 0.63 percent to $1,265.86 an ounce by 4:00 p.m. ET (2000 GMT). Oil prices bounced off session lows for a time after the U.S. government reported a surprise drawdown in crude inventories, but oil ended lower on growing doubts that OPEC would cut production enough to drain a global oversupply. U.S. crude oil futures were at $49.17 a barrel, down 79 cents or 1.58 percent at 4:00 p.m. ET (2000 GMT). They had dipped to $48.87, the lowest since Oct. 4. Brent crude was down 88 cents, or 1.73 percent, at $49.91, their weakest level in nearly a month. The U.S. dollar dipped against a basket of major currencies , reflecting nervousness surrounding Federal Reserve monetary policy and the U.S. election, a day after touching a nearly nine-month high. "We've had a dollar rally, and I think we're in the consolidation phase," said Vassili Serebriakov, FX strategist at Credit Agricole in New York. He noted the Fed's November policy meeting and the Nov. 8 U.S. election as potential risks to the dollar's upside. Sterling recovered from Monday's lows after Bank of England (BoE) governor Mark Carney said in a speech the central bank could not ignore the effect of sterling's slide on inflation. This increased expectations that policymakers would leave rates unchanged next week, rather than cut them as many had expected. Sterling rose 0.43 percent to $1.2238, coming off Monday's trough of $1.2081, which was the lowest level since the Oct. 7 "flash crash". U.S. Treasury debt yields also rose, bolstered by a fresh batch of economic data that enhanced the outlook for third-quarter U.S. gross domestic product data due on Friday. Gains in Treasury yields also spurred rises in other global bond markets. But yields, which move inversely to prices, were capped as the decline in oil kept inflation expectations in check.

The company is delaying the launch of AirPods, its wireless earbuds designed for the iPhone. Apple, which first showed off the accessory in September, said on Wednesday it's not quite ready for prime time. The news comes just one day before Apple's MacBook event in San Francisco, where it was widely believed the AirPods would get a launch date. "The early response to AirPods has been incredible," a spokeswoman for Apple said in a statement to CNNMoney. "We don't believe in shipping a product before it's ready, and we need a little more time before AirPods are ready for our customers." Related: Apple's headphone jack: all your angry questions answered Apple AirPods The AirPods ($159) look like classic white EarPods but connect to products without a cord. With the removal of the headphone jack on the new iPhone 7 smartphones, Apple is pushing the AirPods as the future of wireless earbuds. The technology features a built-in microphone for Siri voice commands and phone calls, with sensors that know when they're inside your ears. Apple declined to elaborate on why it needs more time.

However, Apple fans hoping to snag a pair of the headphones are in for some bad news - Apple has delayed their release, and refused to reveal when they will actually go on sale. 'The early response to AirPods has been incredible,' an Apple spokesperson told¬†TechCrunch. Scroll down for video¬† Apple's $159 AirPods created a huge amount of interest when they were revealed alongside the iPhone 7 earlier this year - but buyers will have to wait to get their hands on a pair. 'We don't believe in shipping a product before it's ready, and we need a little more time before AirPods are ready for our customers,' The wireless ear buds were scheduled to go on sale in late October and cost $159 Although users feel it will only be a matter of time before they lose the AirPods, Apple CEO Tim Cook says he 'never personally had one fall out since using them' and has used them on treadmills. In an exclusive interview with¬†Good Morning America, earlier this year, Tim Cook said it is the weight of the wires that pull the headphones out of people's ears, and by cutting the wires, the earbuds should now stay in place. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Microsoft launches its first PC: $3,000 Surface Studio has... Apple to launch THREE versions of the iPhone 8: Flagship... Does Facebook's facial scanning technology violate privacy... You are NOT as anonymous as you think online: Browsing... Share this article Share 14 shares With the introduction of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, Apple made one of the boldest moves smartphone design has seen in recent years - the removal of the 3.5mm headphone jack. The reason behind the decision, Apple executive Phil Schiller explained was 'the courage to move on and do something new that betters all of us.' Cook spoke with Robin Roberts on ABC News' 'Good Morning America' about the concerns consumers might have about Apple's new AirPods. 'There's a little case that you put the Airpods in and magnetically they're sort of sucked down into the case,' he told Roberts. AirPods (pictured right) resemble Apple's older white EarPods (pictured left) minus an attached cable, and connect to your iPhone using a form of Bluetooth technology 'The wires tend to help the ear bud fall out right because it applies weight on the earbuds.' 'By snipping the wires, I have never personally had one fall out since I have been using them.' Roberts joked with Cook that a colleague was convinced he was going to lose the new headphones, something many people around the world have been saying. 'I've been on treadmills, walking, doing all the things you normally do,' Cook said, adding, 'You know how you walk around with the earbuds and they're constantly getting caught on something? You never have that problem.' A report on abc also reports that the tech guru reveals he dances wearing them too. The interview will air on Wednesday morning from 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. ET.¬† The microphone at the bottom of the AirPods worked well, except during exercise, when heaving breathing made commands difficult for Siri to understand ¬† The wireless ear buds are scheduled to go on sale in late October and cost $159, but Rhiannon Williams with MailOnline was given a sneak peek into the new world of Apple's wireless headphones.¬†¬† AirPods resemble Apple's older white EarPods minus an attached cable. They connect to your iPhone using a form of Bluetooth technology.¬† They work to a distance of around 10 metres from the paired device, meaning if you wander away any further, the connection will drop. To pair them with an iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch or Mac running the latest iOS 10, watchOS 3 or macOS Sierra software, open their small magnetic carry case close to the device and wait for a notification asking to connect.¬† Roberts joked with Cook that a colleague was convinced he was going to lose the new headphones, something many people around the world have been saying WHAT DOES THE CHANGE MEAN FOR YOU?¬† Owners of the iPhone 7 will not be able to directly connect any headphones with a traditional 3.5mm plug.¬† If people want to use other wired headphones, they will need to use the Lightning 3.5mm adapter - which is included with the phone. The phone also comes with new Lightning earbuds, which plug into the charging port.¬† However, this means that users can no longer listen to music while simultaneously charging their phone, unless they use separate charging dock. Apple has also introduced its wireless AirPod headphones, but these are not included with the phone, and cost $159 (¬£159).¬†¬† Every time you remove the headphones from the case and pop them into your ear, they will connect automatically. This is helpful if you're used to fiddling around with Bluetooth on other wireless headphones, ensuring they're forgotten by one device before you try to pair them with another in range. If two compatible devices are near to the AirPods case, you can choose to connect to the earphones via the control centre on your iOS device and selecting 'AirPods'. Slotting the headphones back into the case as music is playing will allow the track to keep going until you close the magnetic lid. The AirPods charge through their case, which in turn is charged by a lightning connector, just as you would an iPhone. Apple claims each AirPod has a battery life of roughly five hours, while we found an hour's worth of continual listening depletes the battery by about 16%.¬† Although users feel it will only be a matter of time before they lose the AirPods, Apple's CEO Tim Cook says he 'has never personally had one fall out since using them'. The tech tycoon suggests it is the wires connected to the earbuds that pull them out of people's ears The case itself carries around 19 hours worth of power on a single charge, equating to around 24 hours battery, the company claims. When the AirPods are not in your ears, they're not using battery power and will automatically recharge once slotted back into the case.¬† The pair use optical sensors and infra-red technology to sense when they've been removed from the wearer's ear.¬† Slotting the headphones back into the case as music is playing will allow the track is keep going until you close the magnetic lid.¬†The case itself carries around 19 hours worth of power on a single charge, equating to around 24 hours battery juice, the company claims Pulling one earphone out of your ears pauses your music, which resumes when inserted back.¬† If you remove both earphones, you'll need to manually press play to resume playback. One unexpected downside of this is it makes it hard to tell if the volume of your music, podcast or video is noisy enough to disturb others around you. Instead of the remote control embedded on the EarPods' wire, you can skip songs or adjust the volume by gently double-tapping on one of the rounded buds, which triggers Apple's digital assistant, Siri Instead of the remote control embedded on the EarPods' wire, you can skip songs or adjust the volume by gently double-tapping on one of the rounded buds, which triggers Apple's digital assistant, Siri. Speaking phrases including 'Resume playback', 'Skip song', or asking Siri to play a certain artist will draw up a selection of their popular tracks, and it smoothly recognised each of our requests - even more complicated demands like 'play the last song'. The only scenario when Siri got slightly confused was when we asked it to 'start playing music', as it prefers 'start playing'. IPHONE 7 AT A GLANCE¬† - New gloss black and black colours - Faster A10 processor¬† - iPhone 7 plus now has a wide angle and a telephoto lens - New Retina HD display is 25% brighter¬† - Now water and dustproof¬† - Home button has force feedback¬† - Stereo speakers at top and bottom with double the volume of previous version - New wireless AirPod headphones available as an extra - No headphone socket - but adapter and lightning EarPods will be in every box¬† - Boosted battery life Apple claims could add 2 hours Siri does tend to err on the side of caution: asking it to turn down the volume from 50 per cent caused the music to become almost inaudible. The AirPods fit comfortably into the ear, and don't tend to need much readjustment once they're in.¬† The audio quality is excellent, and is surprisingly bassy and well-rounded.¬† We were also impressed at the sheer volume they were capable of - a song played at maximum volume through the AirPods sounded much louder than the included lightning connector EarPod pair. The EarPod headphones bundled in with the phones have been given a makeover, and are significantly better at noise retention than the predecessors. One point worth bearing in mind is the price.¬† At ¬£159 in the UK and $159 in the US, the AirPods are undoubtedly expensive, but not ludicrously so when compared to other wireless headphones currently available at a similar quality. ¬†The pair use optical sensors and infra-red technology to sense when they've been removed from the wearer's ear Our key concern is how easy it would be to lose them.¬† Misplacing one or both of the little AirPods or their small case is not beyond the realms of possibility, especially as they aren't connected to each other with a wire the way that the majority of wireless headphones are. However, this ultimately hinges on how careful you are with them. One question on many people's minds following the Apple event was how likely the AirPods are to fall out of your ears whilst exercising. We put this to the test by taking them on several runs on a variety of terrains, including flat pavement, grassy hills and steep cobbles.¬† We experienced no problems whatsoever in terms of the headphones working themselves loose or falling out, and found that they didn't skip or need to be twisted more deeply into the ear like others we've tried in the past. We would welcome a set of small buttons on one or both of the AirPods' stems to skip or replay tracks and change the volume while exercising, as Siri voice commands are just not suitable during exercise The audio was clear and loud, but we found it very difficult to skip tracks or change the volume via Siri.¬† Breathing heavily while exercising doesn't lend itself well to speaking commands, and we found it easier to change songs and adjust sound levels using a paired Apple Watch than on the AirPods themselves.¬† So while Siri commands work well in general environments, you might struggle with them whilst running or playing sports. Overall, the audio standard and brilliant pairing and charging technologies make AirPods an attractive prospect for Apple fans with multiple other iOS, macOS or watchOS devices looking to invest in new wireless headphones for use across the entire product range VERDICT: ¬†ARE THE AIRPODS WORTH BUYING? We've always been largely unimpressed with the quality of Apple's EarPods headphones, and were hoping to see a dramatic improvement in their standard following Apple's acquisition of Beats in 2014. As a result, we are relieved the new lightning EarPods are so much better than their predecessors. With the AirPods, Apple has created a bold new kind of wireless headphone, removing the annoyances of struggling to pair and remembering to turn them off to avoid battery drain.¬† They're surprisingly good at staying put within your ear, and the battery life is commendable. With the AirPods, Apple has created a bold new kind of wireless headphone, removing the annoyances of struggling to pair and remembering to turn them off to avoid battery drain¬† Again, the price is steep enough to put some people off, but we would argue $159 (¬£159) is not entirely unreasonable for high quality wireless headphones - AirPods are roughly in line with their rivals. The likelihood of losing them is real, but this fault lies in the hands of the consumer, rather than the manufacturer.¬† We would, however, welcome a set of small buttons on one or both of the AirPods' stems to skip or replay tracks and change the volume while exercising, as Siri voice commands are just not suitable during exercise. Overall, the audio standard and brilliant pairing and charging technologies make AirPods an attractive prospect for Apple fans looking to invest in new wireless headphones for use across the entire product range. They're not perfect, but for a first generation product, they're pretty good.

When Apple unveiled its wireless AirPods in September, it said they would be available in late October. The world therefore expected Apple to announce during its 27 October event an actual release date for the earbuds - maybe the company would even launch them after the event.¬† Nope. Apple has confirmed to TechCrunch and CNET that it is delaying the launch of its first pair of wireless headphones. In a statement, Apple said it needs "a little more time before AirPods are ready" for customers. Although it didn't provide a new release date¬†for the ¬£159 headphones, Apple explained it doesn't¬†"believe in shipping a product before it‚Äôs ready". Such an Apple thing to say. We're not sure why Apple has delayed the product. It could be a technical issue, but that's just speculation. It's not common for the company to delay launching products, so this news definitely has the rumour mill fired up. For more details on what Apple might actually unveil during its "Hello Again" event, such as the new MacBook Pro with an OLED touch panel, check out this round-up.

Take that, young whippersnappers! By RyanVlastelica Markets reporter Young people might like to say that their elders don‚Äôt understand them, just as baby boomers and senior citizens may be mystified by the antics of those wacky millennials, but when it comes to stocks, the generation gap is pretty much nonexistent. According to data from TD Ameritrade, which mined the holdings of its retail clients, there is a high overlap between the top 10 holdings of the millennial generation, Generation X, baby boomers and senior citizens, though there‚Äôs also enough divergence that the gains of seniors this year are nearly double that of millennials. Five stocks are a top-10 holding for all four generations: Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft and General Electric. Another three ‚Äî Berkshire Hathaway (the class B shares), Bank of America and Exxon Mobil ‚Äî are held by three of the four. Apple is the top stock for each generation, which shouldn‚Äôt be surprising. Not only is it one of the best-known brands in existence, and a stock that has risen in fairly uninterrupted fashion for years, but it is the largest U.S. company by market cap. As such, it is a core component ‚Äî if not the top holding ‚Äî for dozens of equity-based mutual funds and exchange-traded funds. Similar reasoning could account for the other names, all of which are among the top 20 largest U.S. companies, as well as being bellwethers in their respective industries. In each generation, there is at least one stock that isn‚Äôt a top 10 holding for the others. For millennials, there are two: Walt Disney Co. and Tesla Motors. While the former is a Dow component and just as established as the more widely held companies, it could have particular appeal to younger investors, given they are the primary target audience for such Disney properties as Marvel, Pixar and ‚ÄúStar Wars.‚Äù Electric-car maker Tesla, on the other hand, could be a popular choice given the predisposition of millennials to environmentalism. (That said, Tesla appears just below oil giant Exxon among their holdings.) Disney and Tesla have been under pressure this year, with both down more than 10% in 2016. That has resulted in millennials posting the worst year-to-date performance of any generational group (assuming an equal weighting of holdings), though all four age groups beat the 4.7% gain of the S&P 500 SPX, -0.01% ¬† Surprisingly, the generation of ‚ÄúNetflix and chill‚Äù doesn‚Äôt hold the streaming-media company as a top-10 holding. Instead, that outlier belongs to Generation X, where it is the generation‚Äôs eighth-most widely held company. The other company unique to Gen X is Google parent Alphabet Inc., which actually takes up two spots, with both its class A and its class C shares charting. Baby boomers only have one outlying company, but it‚Äôs one that defined the technological progress made throughout their lifetimes: the old-school technology giant Intel Corp. Seniors citizens were the only generation to eschew Berkshire, run by the 86-year-old legendary investor Warren Buffett. They were also the generation with the most unique portfolios relative to the other age groups. Three of their top 10 holdings don‚Äôt appear in the other generations: Johnson & Johnson, Verizon Communications and tobacco company Altria Group. Telecommunications and consumer staples are both considered defensive industries, meaning they outperform in market downturns. The sectors also tend to offer dividend yields above the broader market, which has contributed to seniors‚Äô year-to-date outperformance, as dividends have become a popular investment strategy amid low bond yields. J&J, Verizon and Altria, in addition to being well-established brands, could reflect a preference on the part of seniors for a more conservative allocation. Younger investors, in contrast, can afford to be riskier, having more time to make up for any portfolio volatility. See the top 10 holdings of each generation below.

"We don't believe in shipping a product before it's ready, and we need a little more time before AirPods are ready for our customers," Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller said in an email to Reuters. Apple unveiled the AirPod at the launch of the latest iPhone last month. The new iPhones come without the analog headphone jack.

When Apple unveiled its wireless AirPods in September, it said they would be available in late October. The world therefore expected Apple to announce during its 27 October event an actual release date for the earbuds - maybe the company would even launch them after the event.¬† Nope. Apple has confirmed to TechCrunch and CNET that it is delaying the launch of its first pair of wireless headphones. In a statement, Apple said it needs "a little more time before AirPods are ready" for customers. Although it didn't provide a new release date¬†for the ¬£159 headphones, Apple explained it doesn't¬†"believe in shipping a product before it‚Äôs ready". Such an Apple thing to say. We're not sure why Apple has delayed the product. It could be a technical issue, but that's just speculation. It's not common for the company to delay launching products, so this news definitely has the rumour mill fired up. For more details on what Apple might actually unveil during its "Hello Again" event, such as the new MacBook Pro with an OLED touch panel, check out this round-up.

No longer.¬† Microsoft is now the one to watch as it hones in on designing high-end PCs for power users, with the Surface Studio its best piece yet.¬† The rest of the PC manufacturing world has yet to catch up, but it may not have to if the company continues to focus exclusively on elite design. Announced on October 26, Surface Studio is Microsoft's first all-in-one desktop, but not aimed at the traditional all-in-one niche of consumers. Instead, Studio is targeted directly at creative professionals, such as graphic artists ‚Äì once Apple's go-to buyers. The new machine boasts a 28 inch touchscreen display with 13.5 million pixels and 10-bit color depth, better than 4K TV resolution at 192 ppi.¬† The display uses a "zero gravity" hinge, so it can be easily moved from a standard upright display into Studio Mode, a slanted angle that can be written on with a Surface Pen.¬† One could argue this feature alone makes Apple's efforts over the past three years look lame. If using a Surface Pen for creation on a high-resolution 28 inch workspace isn't impressive enough, Microsoft added a new control widget, Surface Dial, to complement the traditional Pen, keyboard and mouse.¬† Surface Dial is a round, puck-shaped device than can be used besides and directly on top of the Studio's screen.¬† Press and hold Dial to get a radial (circle) menu of tools to dial through or put it on the screen and see what software options are available.¬† For example, artists can more easily and quickly change a color or style by using Dial, rather than lifting up the Pen and having to sort through a set of menus; there's no interruption of drawing workflow. Depending on the app, Dial can be used to rotate or scale a canvas, tilt in 3D, adjust the volume on music, and access other tools.¬† The $99 Bluetooth accessory can also be used with the Surface and Surface Book in a number of applications. Microsoft emphasizes "the creative process" throughout its descriptions of the Surface Studio, again, the sort of thing Apple used to have a monopoly on.¬† You see a lot on ease of use and tools for working with media, while detailed hardware specs are submerged if they aren't needed. But creative tools aren't going to be cheap. The basic Surface Studio with 1TB of storage, an Intel Core i5, 8GB of RAM and 2GB RAM with a NVIDIA GeForce GPU will cost $3000 and be available on December 15. At the high end, a 2TB drive, Intel Core i7, 32GB RAM and 4GB graphics support will cost a whopping $4200.¬† All versions include 802.11ac WiFi, Bluetooth 4.0, wireless keyboard and mouse, 4 USB 3.0 ports, mini Displayport, full size SD card reader, 3.5mm headset jack, a 1 Gig Ethernet port, 5 MP front facing camera with 1080p HD video, dual microphones, , XBox Wireless Controller support, and stereo speakers with Dolby Audio Premium.¬† If there are technical weaknesses in Studio, it's the lack of support for USB-C and WiGig. Everyone is going to compare the Surface Studio with the best Apple desktop hardware, because there's nothing else in the PC world that even comes close, both in terms of design and the target audience.¬† And maybe that's how Microsoft wants it, to be content with capturing mindshare among designers and other creative types, such as engineers, while the rest of the PC world makes lower cost commodity hardware for everyone else.¬† You can find a similar pattern in the Surface Pro and Surface Book offerings, with marketing and specs geared to compete and best Apple products with higher-end pricing to reflect quality. As strange as it sounds, we're less than three months from CES 2017.¬† It will be interesting to compare Microsoft's Surface hardware with the rest of the PC world's latest and greatest, but I suspect there's a lot of catching up to do.

While this year's expanded Cider Week NYC is focusing on reminding people that cider is a year-round drink, there's something especially nice about enjoying it during the season when New Yorkers flock to pick-your-own orchards to take apples home fresh from the farm. And many of the New York apples that don't wind up plucked by orchard-goers are used in locally made hard ciders. The vast majority of the more than 20 ciders available at Monday night's Cider Revival, hosted at the Bowery Hotel as part of Cider Week, were made in the state. If you're looking for a new way to enjoy cider, consider pairing it with cheese as you would wine. These ciders -- many of which are dry and much less sweet than the uninitiated might assume -- were served alongside fondue and other snacks from Murray's Cheese Bar Monday night, and they stood up to the savoriness. Here are eight ciders made in the state -- and even in the city -- worth seeking out this season. Descendant Cider Company's Pom Pomme Descendant Cider runs its operation right here in New York City, churning out small batches in Queens. Their Pom Pomme is a sparkling dry concoction that blends apples, pomegranate and hibiscus flowers. "It's pretty tart. It has a little bit of residual sweetness, but mostly it's dry," co-founder Jahil Maplestone said.

The company‚Äôs full statement is as follows: ‚ÄúThe early response to AirPods has been incredible. We don‚Äôt believe in shipping a product before it‚Äôs ready, and we need a little more time before AirPods are ready for our customers.‚Äù This news is disappointing for consumers that were planning on picking up some AirPods this month, especially since Apple hasn‚Äôt given us a new release date to look forward to. It‚Äôs unclear exactly what about the AirPods needs to work on before they‚Äôre released, but it‚Äôs probably wise for Apple to hold them back until they‚Äôre ready, as it‚Äôd probably be even more frustrating for consumers if AirPods were released on time but ended up being buggy. Whenever they‚Äôre launched, Apple‚Äôs AirPods will cost $159.

French Apple Store Smasher Sentenced, Ordered To Repay $19K In¬†Damages Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share French Apple Store Smasher Sentenced, Ordered To Repay $19K In¬†Damages October 26, 2016 4:15 pm EST By Laura Northrup@lnorthrup super smash brother bad consumers apple store dijon france apple The man who went on a phone-smashing spree at a mall near Dijon, France, reportedly because the company wouldn‚Äôt replace his defective iPhone, has received a six-month suspended prison sentence. He must stay away from the mall and pay Apple back for his destruction spree. While the man now says that he was filled with uncontrollable rage at Apple, he looked very calm on camera as he moved through the store methodically smashing every display model with a hollow steel ball used in the Bocce-like game p√©tanque. Yeah, let‚Äôs watch the video again. How much did that spree cost? That turned out to be a dispute between the French criminal justice system and Apple, since the store apparently whisked the smashed items away and replaced them with new displays before the police could inspect the crime scene. While Apple claimed that the destroyed merchandise was worth ‚Ç¨60,000 ($65,415), the tribunal set the amount that the disgruntled customer has to repay at ‚Ç¨17,548 ($19,134). The correctional tribunal (where misdemeanors are prosecuted in France) noted that the items destroyed were display models, and shouldn‚Äôt necessarily be valued at their original retail price. The tribunal also imposed a ‚Ç¨300 ($327) fine for violence against a mall security guard, and two years of probation.

The tech giant showed off what it calls "AirPods" last month, during an event where it also introduced the new iPhone 7 smartphones. But unlike the iPhones, which went on sale in late September, Apple had said the AirPods would go on sale in late October. Now the Cupertino, California company isn't saying when they'll be released, or why it needs more time. You can still listen to audio on the new iPhones by using other wireless headsets or plugging into the phone's charging port, although older headsets may need a plug adapter.

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Thursday, 27 October 2016 | MYT 3:53 AM Boeing rally lifts Dow, Apple weighs on S&P, Nasdaq At 12:36pm ET (1636 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 48.93 points, or 0.27%, at 18,218.2. The AFP photo shows the front of the New York Stock Exchange. NEW YORK: A rally in Boeing‚Äôs shares helped the Dow reverse course in the early afternoon session on Wednesday, while Apple continued to weigh on the Nasdaq and the S&P 500. Apple‚Äôs shares fell 2.6% after the world‚Äôs most valuable public company said sales of its flagship iPhones fell for the third quarter in a row. Apple was the top drag on all three major indexes. The S&P 500 technology index fell 0.25%, weighing the most on the benchmark index. Boeing shares were trading at their highest level this year, after the world‚Äôs largest planemaker reported a jump in quarterly profit despite slower sales. The stock gave the biggest boost to the S&P and the Dow. Movement on Wall Street has largely been dictated by corporate earnings in the past few weeks, but events such as the Nov 8 US presidential election and the Federal Reserve‚Äôs policy meet next week have added volatility. Overall earnings of S&P 500 companies are expected to rise 2.2%, snapping a four-quarter streak of profit declines, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Excluding Apple, earnings are expected to grow at a 2.9% rate. ‚ÄúThe markets have been rallying in anticipation of good numbers and earnings have been coming in a little bit soft,‚Äù said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago. The CBOE Market Volatility index was up for the second day in a row, after having been in negative territory for the past five trading days. ‚ÄúWhile earnings in the technology sector haven‚Äôt been fabulous, you are going to have better performance in general out of the sector, because revenue is still growing and they have great cash flow,‚Äù Nolte said. At 12:36pm ET (1636 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 48.93 points, or 0.27%, at 18,218.2. The S&P 500 was down 1.04 points, or 0.05%, at 2,142.12 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 16.97 points, or 0.32%, at 5,266.43. One bright spot on the Nasdaq was Mondelez, which is on track for its best day in nearly two months after reporting a third-quarter profit that beat estimates. Chipotle Mexican Grill was on track for its worst day this year, with its shares off 8.2% after the restaurant chain operator reported a bigger-than-expected drop in quarterly sales at established restaurants. Edwards Lifesciences was the biggest loser on the S&P 500, falling 13.6% after the medical device maker reported third-quarter sales that missed expectations. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 1,678 to 1,156. On the Nasdaq, 1,482 issues fell and 1,168 advanced. The S&P showed nine new 52-week highs and five new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 44 new highs and 56 new lows. - Reuters You May Be Interested Weak ringgit to impact 5 sectors Billionaire Warren Buffett's Berkshire makes bet on US airlines TM signs RM916mil service deal with MYTV Broadcasting Where are you on the journey to financial freedom?

And while they won‚Äôt come with E Ink keyboards just yet, they will have that slick OLED touch bar ‚Äî which Apple is calling the Magic Toolbar. At least that‚Äôs how things look now that Mac OS 10.12.1 has been released. How does the release of new software tell us anything about the new MacBooks? Because of a handful of images that were shipped with the update. The image above, for example, which is actually showing off two things apart from the existence of the Toolbar itself. First, there‚Äôs the arrival of Touch ID. The sensor is embedded at the far right side of the Magic Toolbar, and you‚Äôll be able to use it to do the same things you can do on an iPhone or iPad. One of those things is making payments with Apple Pay. The second thing the image shows is the Magic Toolbar‚Äôs contextual awareness. Knowing that there‚Äôs an Apple Pay prompt on the screen, the Toolbar helpfully draws an arrow to direct your finger to the Touch ID sensor ‚Äî and places a cancel button at the opposite end in case you‚Äôre having second thoughts about your purchase. Apple has a big event scheduled for tomorrow, so you don‚Äôt have long to wait to find out whether the Magic Toolbar will ship on the 2016 MacBook Pro. While the Magic Toolbar and Touch ID are being added, several other things are believed to be going away ‚Äî like the MagSafe port, SD reader, and HDMI output. The headphone jack is sticking around, though, and the MacBook Pro will feature several USB Type-C ports‚Ä¶ unlike the standard MacBook.

¬† Home U.K. News Sports U.S. Showbiz Australia Femail Health Science Money Video Travel Columnists Wires Home My Profile Logout Login Feedback DailyMail NEW ARTICLESHomeTop Share show ad US STOCKS-Earnings in focus as Apple weighs; Boeing lifts Dow By Reuters Published: 16:24 EST, 26 October 2016 | Updated: 16:24 EST, 26 October 2016 e-mail By Rodrigo Campos Oct 26 (Reuters) - Quarterly results were the main driver for Wall Street on Wednesday as a decline in Apple shares weighed on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, while the price-weighted Dow Industrials was buoyed by gains in Boeing. Apple, the world's largest exchange-traded company, fell 2.2 percent after it acknowledged that strong demand for its iPhone 7 Plus caught the company off-guard and it was struggling to keep up. On the other hand, Boeing shares hit their highest level since Dec. 31 after the planemaker reported a jump in quarterly profit despite slower sales. Boeing closed up 4.7 percent at $145.54. S&P 500 earnings have so far surprised on the upside, with the blended growth estimate at 2.2 percent, from a 0.5 percent decline expected at the start of this month. Of the companies that have reported, 74 percent have beaten analyst expectations - above the 70 percent beat rate over the past four quarters, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. "There's an expectation that when we finish the season that the earnings recession will be abated and that should be positive for the market going forward," said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial in Newark, New Jersey. She said, however, that a number of earnings misses left the market in a tight range and in search of a stronger catalyst. "The market looks tired," Krosby said. "Breadth has been narrowing and that has a number of (technical analysts)telegraphing caution." The number of weekly 52-week highs on the New York Stock Exchange has diminished sharply from the year's peak in late June, at more than 1,500, to less than 400 last week and just 262 so far this week. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 30.06 points, or 0.17 percent, to 18,199.33, the S&P 500 lost 3.73 points, or 0.17 percent, to 2,139.43 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 33.13 points, or 0.63 percent, to 5,250.27. About 6.6 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, above the 6.4 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions. Chipotle Mexican Grill shares slumped 9.3 percent after the restaurant chain operator reported a bigger-than-expected drop in quarterly sales at established restaurants. Edwards Lifesciences was the biggest loser on the S&P 500, falling 17.1 percent after the medical device maker's third-quarter sales missed expectations. On the positive column, Mondelez added 3.6 percent to $44.32 after its quarterly profit beat estimates and it raised its profit forecast for the year. Earlier, economic data showed new home sales unexpectedly rose and both wholesale and retail inventories increased in September, while the goods trade deficit narrowed sharply, suggesting a stronger pickup in economic growth in the third quarter than is currently anticipated. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.83-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.21-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 9 new 52-week highs and 5 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 55 new highs and 77 new lows.

 Apple's AirPods are delayed Antonio Villas-Boas Oct. 26, 2016, 3:43 PM 8,793 facebook linkedin twitter email print Hollis Johnson/Business Insider Apple told TechCrunch on Wednesday that it needs "a little more time" before it can release its truly wireless earphones, called AirPods. Here's what the Apple spokesperson told TechCrunch: "The early response to AirPods has been incredible. We don't believe in shipping a product before it's ready, and we need a little more time before AirPods are ready for our customers." The AirPods were originally meant to be released in October. Unfortunately, there's no telling how much time Apple needs or when it'll release the AirPods. You can read our review of the AirPods here. A lot of fancy tech is packed into the sleek and slim AirPods package. Apple's AirPods are essentially Bluetooth earphones with Apple's W1 chip, which makes for easy pairing and connecting to your Apple devices when you open the AirPods charging case. It's one of the best things about the AirPods, as the pairing and connecting process with regular Bluetooth headphones can be a frustrating and convoluted affair. The AirPods also sense when they're in your ears to automatically start and stop music. One thing they're missing, however, is good music controls. As my colleague Steve Kovach wrote in his review, "you have to do everything through Siri or directly on your phone" and tell it what you want out loud, which isn't as easy as tapping a button or swiping a touch surface for simple tasks, like adjusting volume or playing the next song. Either way, they're overall a good, convenient pair of wireless headphones. Just try not to lose them ‚Äîor even just one! EXCLUSIVE FREE REPORT: 25 Big Tech Predictions by BI Intelligence.

 China is still dragging Apple down Jeff Dunn Oct. 26, 2016, 3:38 PM 1,776 facebook linkedin twitter email print More Charts ¬† Apple has suffered its first annual revenue decline since 2001. Though that means the company ‚Äúonly‚Äù generated $215.6 billion in the past year, the drop has still made plenty of analysts skeptical. One of the biggest drags on Apple‚Äôs earnings has been China. After being touted as a major source of growth potential by CEO Tim Cook, and after enjoying big success there to start, Apple has suffered a continuous series of sales declines in the region over the past few quarters. This past quarter, its China sales fell 30%. As this chart from Statista shows, the company‚Äôs dollar sales growth in China has dropped by $10.2 billion in the last year. Over that time, the iPhone has lost swaths of market share to local upstarts like Oppo and Vivo. The company has also run into a number of regulatory issues with local officials. On Thursday‚Äôs earnings call, Cook remained bullish, noting China‚Äôs wider economic struggles and saying the iPhone‚Äôs initial gains gave it further to fall than usual. The company is confident iPhone 7 and 7 Plus sales will give it a boost. And if the 2017 iPhone is as mindblowing as its already massive hype suggests, that should only help. But there‚Äôs a reason Cook and company are putting more eyes toward India: The sharks want growth, and Apple hasn't really shown how it's going to get more of it from its former cash cow.¬† Statista EXCLUSIVE FREE REPORT: 25 Big Tech Predictions by BI Intelligence.

"The early response to AirPods has been incredible," Apple told CNBC. "We don't believe in shipping a product before it's ready, and we need a little more time before AirPods are ready for our customers." AirPods are listed as available in "late October" on Apple's website, so it is unclear whether there is a new timeline for the product. The AirPods, a wireless version of Apple's hallmark white earbuds, claim to be more power efficient than Bluetooth devices, thanks to a special communications chip. The $159 device came alongside a new phone with no 3.5-millimeter headphone jack. But after their debut in September, reviewers complained the AirPods "look odd" and had occasional glitches. Audio experts told CNBC that launching AirPods gives Apple a first shot at a new market, even if the technology is still in the early stages.

The Auxillite's simple aluminum design makes it look like something I'd be Okay with having on my phone The¬†Auxillite is another crowdfunded adapter that hopes to make up for Apple‚Äôs 3.5mm omission by adding a Lightning port and headphone jack to the iPhone 7. It takes a different approach to most of the other solutions we‚Äôve seen so far, by positioning the headphone and second Lightning port perpendicularly to the iPhone's charging port, allowing for a much slimmer profile on the bottom of the phone. And while there have been other dual-port iPhone 7 adapters, the Auxillite's simple aluminum design and small size makes it look like something I'd actually be okay with having on my phone (that I also wouldn't be afraid of suddenly snapping off). There are two versions of the Auxillite: the standard model and the Auxillite S, that includes a foldable kickstand for propping up your phone. The Auxillite also serves as a DAC (playing back 16-bit audio with a 44.1kHz/48kHz sampling frequency and 24-bit audio with a 96kHz sampling frequency) and is also available in a Micro USB version. I assume any Android devices using the Auxillite would mostly be to benefit from the allegedly higher quality DAC, since I‚Äôm not currently aware of any major Micro USB phones that don't have a 3.5mm headphone jack. A USB-C version might have made more sense, given that there actually are USB-C phones without headphone jacks, but I guess that may have to wait for a later Auxillite model. Additionally, due to apparent "safety issues / design limitation[s]," the Micro USB Auxillite isn't able to simultaneously play music and charge a phone at the same time. The Auxillite costs $13 for the regular version and $17 for the Auxillite S, and is hoping to ship in January. As always with crowdfunded hardware, it‚Äôs important to be aware that the company has never shipped a product before. While Auxillite has applied for Apple‚Äôs MFi hardware certification, it has yet to receive approval. That said, if you're going to have to have an extra adapter for your iPhone to charge and listen to music simultaneously, the Auxillite could be the nicest-looking option available. iPhone 7 and 7 Plus review Via: Design Taxi Source: Auxillite (Kickstarter) Next Up In Circuit Breaker Some 'Enhanced' games are having framerate issues on the PS4 Pro Marshall mixes old and new with its latest Bluetooth headphones How much should the Nintendo Switch cost?

In an exclusive interview with¬†Good Morning America, earlier this year, Tim Cook said it is the weight of the wires that pull the headphones out of people's ears, and by cutting the wires, the earbuds should now stay in place.

Share this article Share 14 shares With the introduction of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, Apple made one of the boldest moves smartphone design has seen in recent years - the removal of the 3.5mm headphone jack. The reason behind the decision, Apple executive Phil Schiller explained was 'the courage to move on and do something new that betters all of us.' Cook spoke with Robin Roberts on ABC News' 'Good Morning America' about the concerns consumers might have about Apple's new AirPods. 'There's a little case that you put the Airpods in and magnetically they're sort of sucked down into the case,' he told Roberts. AirPods (pictured right) resemble Apple's older white EarPods (pictured left) minus an attached cable, and connect to your iPhone using a form of Bluetooth technology 'The wires tend to help the ear bud fall out right because it applies weight on the earbuds.' 'By snipping the wires, I have never personally had one fall out since I have been using them.' Roberts joked with Cook that a colleague was convinced he was going to lose the new headphones, something many people around the world have been saying. 'I've been on treadmills, walking, doing all the things you normally do,' Cook said, adding, 'You know how you walk around with the earbuds and they're constantly getting caught on something? You never have that problem.' A report on abc also reports that the tech guru reveals he dances wearing them too. The interview will air on Wednesday morning from 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. ET.¬† The microphone at the bottom of the AirPods worked well, except during exercise, when heaving breathing made commands difficult for Siri to understand ¬† The wireless ear buds are scheduled to go on sale in late October and cost $159, but Rhiannon Williams with MailOnline was given a sneak peek into the new world of Apple's wireless headphones.¬†¬† AirPods resemble Apple's older white EarPods minus an attached cable. They connect to your iPhone using a form of Bluetooth technology.¬† They work to a distance of around 10 metres from the paired device, meaning if you wander away any further, the connection will drop. To pair them with an iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch or Mac running the latest iOS 10, watchOS 3 or macOS Sierra software, open their small magnetic carry case close to the device and wait for a notification asking to connect.¬† Roberts joked with Cook that a colleague was convinced he was going to lose the new headphones, something many people around the world have been saying WHAT DOES THE CHANGE MEAN FOR YOU?¬† Owners of the iPhone 7 will not be able to directly connect any headphones with a traditional 3.5mm plug.¬† If people want to use other wired headphones, they will need to use the Lightning 3.5mm adapter - which is included with the phone. The phone also comes with new Lightning earbuds, which plug into the charging port.¬† However, this means that users can no longer listen to music while simultaneously charging their phone, unless they use separate charging dock. Apple has also introduced its wireless AirPod headphones, but these are not included with the phone, and cost $159 (¬£159).¬†¬† Every time you remove the headphones from the case and pop them into your ear, they will connect automatically. This is helpful if you're used to fiddling around with Bluetooth on other wireless headphones, ensuring they're forgotten by one device before you try to pair them with another in range. If two compatible devices are near to the AirPods case, you can choose to connect to the earphones via the control centre on your iOS device and selecting 'AirPods'. Slotting the headphones back into the case as music is playing will allow the track to keep going until you close the magnetic lid. The AirPods charge through their case, which in turn is charged by a lightning connector, just as you would an iPhone. Apple claims each AirPod has a battery life of roughly five hours, while we found an hour's worth of continual listening depletes the battery by about 16%.¬† Although users feel it will only be a matter of time before they lose the AirPods, Apple's CEO Tim Cook says he 'has never personally had one fall out since using them'. The tech tycoon suggests it is the wires connected to the earbuds that pull them out of people's ears The case itself carries around 19 hours worth of power on a single charge, equating to around 24 hours battery, the company claims. When the AirPods are not in your ears, they're not using battery power and will automatically recharge once slotted back into the case.¬† The pair use optical sensors and infra-red technology to sense when they've been removed from the wearer's ear.¬† Slotting the headphones back into the case as music is playing will allow the track is keep going until you close the magnetic lid.¬†The case itself carries around 19 hours worth of power on a single charge, equating to around 24 hours battery juice, the company claims Pulling one earphone out of your ears pauses your music, which resumes when inserted back.¬† If you remove both earphones, you'll need to manually press play to resume playback. One unexpected downside of this is it makes it hard to tell if the volume of your music, podcast or video is noisy enough to disturb others around you. Instead of the remote control embedded on the EarPods' wire, you can skip songs or adjust the volume by gently double-tapping on one of the rounded buds, which triggers Apple's digital assistant, Siri Instead of the remote control embedded on the EarPods' wire, you can skip songs or adjust the volume by gently double-tapping on one of the rounded buds, which triggers Apple's digital assistant, Siri. Speaking phrases including 'Resume playback', 'Skip song', or asking Siri to play a certain artist will draw up a selection of their popular tracks, and it smoothly recognised each of our requests - even more complicated demands like 'play the last song'. The only scenario when Siri got slightly confused was when we asked it to 'start playing music', as it prefers 'start playing'. IPHONE 7 AT A GLANCE¬† - New gloss black and black colours - Faster A10 processor¬† - iPhone 7 plus now has a wide angle and a telephoto lens - New Retina HD display is 25% brighter¬† - Now water and dustproof¬† - Home button has force feedback¬† - Stereo speakers at top and bottom with double the volume of previous version - New wireless AirPod headphones available as an extra - No headphone socket - but adapter and lightning EarPods will be in every box¬† - Boosted battery life Apple claims could add 2 hours Siri does tend to err on the side of caution: asking it to turn down the volume from 50 per cent caused the music to become almost inaudible. The AirPods fit comfortably into the ear, and don't tend to need much readjustment once they're in.¬† The audio quality is excellent, and is surprisingly bassy and well-rounded.¬† We were also impressed at the sheer volume they were capable of - a song played at maximum volume through the AirPods sounded much louder than the included lightning connector EarPod pair. The EarPod headphones bundled in with the phones have been given a makeover, and are significantly better at noise retention than the predecessors. One point worth bearing in mind is the price.¬† At ¬£159 in the UK and $159 in the US, the AirPods are undoubtedly expensive, but not ludicrously so when compared to other wireless headphones currently available at a similar quality. ¬†The pair use optical sensors and infra-red technology to sense when they've been removed from the wearer's ear Our key concern is how easy it would be to lose them.¬† Misplacing one or both of the little AirPods or their small case is not beyond the realms of possibility, especially as they aren't connected to each other with a wire the way that the majority of wireless headphones are. However, this ultimately hinges on how careful you are with them. One question on many people's minds following the Apple event was how likely the AirPods are to fall out of your ears whilst exercising. We put this to the test by taking them on several runs on a variety of terrains, including flat pavement, grassy hills and steep cobbles.¬† We experienced no problems whatsoever in terms of the headphones working themselves loose or falling out, and found that they didn't skip or need to be twisted more deeply into the ear like others we've tried in the past. We would welcome a set of small buttons on one or both of the AirPods' stems to skip or replay tracks and change the volume while exercising, as Siri voice commands are just not suitable during exercise The audio was clear and loud, but we found it very difficult to skip tracks or change the volume via Siri.¬† Breathing heavily while exercising doesn't lend itself well to speaking commands, and we found it easier to change songs and adjust sound levels using a paired Apple Watch than on the AirPods themselves.¬† So while Siri commands work well in general environments, you might struggle with them whilst running or playing sports. Overall, the audio standard and brilliant pairing and charging technologies make AirPods an attractive prospect for Apple fans with multiple other iOS, macOS or watchOS devices looking to invest in new wireless headphones for use across the entire product range VERDICT: ¬†ARE THE AIRPODS WORTH BUYING? We've always been largely unimpressed with the quality of Apple's EarPods headphones, and were hoping to see a dramatic improvement in their standard following Apple's acquisition of Beats in 2014. As a result, we are relieved the new lightning EarPods are so much better than their predecessors. With the AirPods, Apple has created a bold new kind of wireless headphone, removing the annoyances of struggling to pair and remembering to turn them off to avoid battery drain.¬† They're surprisingly good at staying put within your ear, and the battery life is commendable. With the AirPods, Apple has created a bold new kind of wireless headphone, removing the annoyances of struggling to pair and remembering to turn them off to avoid battery drain¬† Again, the price is steep enough to put some people off, but we would argue $159 (¬£159) is not entirely unreasonable for high quality wireless headphones - AirPods are roughly in line with their rivals. The likelihood of losing them is real, but this fault lies in the hands of the consumer, rather than the manufacturer.¬† We would, however, welcome a set of small buttons on one or both of the AirPods' stems to skip or replay tracks and change the volume while exercising, as Siri voice commands are just not suitable during exercise. Overall, the audio standard and brilliant pairing and charging technologies make AirPods an attractive prospect for Apple fans looking to invest in new wireless headphones for use across the entire product range. They're not perfect, but for a first generation product, they're pretty good.

In a statement,¬†first given to¬†TechCrunch, Apple says that it "need[s] a little more time before AirPods are ready for our customers." It didn't provide an estimate for when the headphones would launch, only saying that "We don‚Äôt believe in shipping a product before it‚Äôs ready." It sounds like there's something left to fix It's not clear exactly what the holdup is. Apple sent out preproduction AirPods units for various reviewers to test out alongside the iPhone 7. At the time, there didn't appear to be any major bugs. But it sounds like there's some sort of technical issue that still needs to be worked out. Apple delaying products is pretty rare, but it's happened a few times in recent memory. Most recently, Apple delayed the launch of watchOS 2 on the day of its intended launch after discovering a bug. By putting out a statement on the AirPods ahead of time, Apple gets out of the way something that it'd likely rather not highlight during¬†its on-stage presentation tomorrow morning, when it'll announce¬†the new MacBook Pro.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics¬† Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search How Surface Studio takes on iMac in 5 steps Chris Burns - Oct 26, 2016 7 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit The Microsoft Surface Studio was revealed this morning in a presentation that may be making Apple apprehensive. You see, Apple has an event taking place tomorrow, and they‚Äôll be revealing their own machines. It‚Äôs likely Apple will have a set of new MacBook Pro units ready for the public then. But for now, Microsoft is attempting to get in while the getting is good. Microsoft made some top notch moves in their presentation this week. The company dedicated their last 100 (give or take a few hundred) presentations to work and games. Now, at last, Microsoft comes out punching for creative applications. The Surface Book i7, Windows 10 VR, and game streaming upgrades were interesting on their own. But it‚Äôs the Surface Studio where Microsoft is aiming to change the way creative people make art. And design things, and illustrate, and conjure up 3D sculptures in the digital realm. 1. Industrial Design This desktop machine‚Äôs industrial design is much like the newest wave of Surface devices. That means sleek, simple, and quite plain ‚Äì in a good way. This machine is silver matte aluminum and has a small black bezel around its edges ‚Äì and little else. The display is on display and is ready for use as a tool, too. With a ‚ÄúZero Gravity Hinge‚Äù the user will be able to move the height of the display and angle up and down with ease. The weight of this PC is 21.07 lbs max (9.56 kg) ‚Äì we‚Äôll have to assume for now that most of the weight is in the base. Angles at which the user can work and holding tight when the time comes will be important. The iMac doesn‚Äôt move like that. 2. Surface Pen In this device is the hardware necessary to work with the newest Microsoft Surface Pen. The Surface Pen works with 1,024-levels of pressure sensitivity and ‚Äúa working eraser.‚Äù This stylus can attach to the side of the Surface Studio magnetically, like the rest of the Surface line. Apple has the Apple Pencil, but it only works with the iPad Pro (for now). Microsoft has worked with a variety of software partners to make sure the Surface Studio is tops. Surface Studio‚Äôs integration with the Surface Pen works with pro creative apps aplenty. SOLIDWORKS works, as does Autodesk and Adobe Premiere Pro. 3. Surface Dial In a fashion sort-of like Wacom‚Äôs Cintiq Touch display, the Surface Studio includes a menu tool. This tool is not like Wacom‚Äôs ‚Äì Wacom‚Äôs is a set of soft-press buttons. The Surface Dial is a device which can do many things, including summoning a set of menues inside Windows 10. Proximity of the Dial to the display changes what‚Äôs seen and available for selecting. The Surface Dial is able to adjust the volume of a music track, or scroll through pages in a web browser. The Dial can let users ‚Äúfly through‚Äù cities in Windows Maps by zooming in tangent with touch controls. All the while, this Dial provides haptic feedback to further the connective experience. Microsoft‚Äôs Surface Dial can be had separate from the Surface Studio. In fact it works with several Surface devices, and is available from Microsoft online for a cool $99 USD. The only down side to this piece of equipment is its necessity for 2x AAA bateries (included). But Microsoft does mention a ‚Äú12 months typical‚Äù battery life (with 4-hour daily use). 4. Specs Battle A Surface Studio with 1TB storage, 8GB RAM, and Intel Core i5 processor rings in at $2,999. This device has a 28-inch display with resolution 4500 x 3000 and 10-point multi-touch. This device has adjustable head and body hinges so it‚Äôs able to function at a wide variety of angles. An Apple iMac with 1TB of storage, 8GB RAM, and Intel Core i5 processor rings in at $1,799. This device has a 27-inch display with resolution 5120 x 2880 and no touch capabilities. This device‚Äôs display angle adjustments rest in its head alone. The iMac has a sharper display, and its display is 1-inch smaller. The Surface Studio is not limited to what it‚Äôs able to do with a mouse/touchpad and keyboard. Surface Studio comes with a touchscreen, Surface Pen, and Surface Dial for creative control. 5. Xbox The Surface Studio is able to work with an Xbox One Wireless Controller right out the box. This and the fact that this device runs Windows 10 makes plain its more open ability to play games of all sorts. Windows 10‚Äôs ‚ÄúXbox Play Anywhere‚Äù games allow shared progress from Xbox One to PC and back again. Lots of games are available on the iMac ‚Äì but most games come to Windows first, and often not to OS X at all. Apple hasn‚Äôt made the major strides in controlling the gaming experience that Microsoft has. While there are PCs better for straight up gaming, the Surface Studio has some real potential. In addition to the Surface Studio, Microsoft has a number of creative bits and pieces ready for release. Have a peek at details about the Windows 10 Creators Update and have at it soon. Especially if you have a Surface device, things are about to get wild.

Apple is sliding after its latest results failed to impress investors, pulling technology stocks down with it. Health care stocks are falling while banks and industrial companies inch higher. KEEPING SCORE: The Dow Jones industrial average added 46 points, or 0.3 percent, to 18,215 as of 3:20 p.m. Eastern time. The Standard & Poor‚Äôs 500 index lost 3 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,140. The Nasdaq composite shed 31 points, or 0.6 percent, to 5,252. WATCHING AND WAITING: Stocks haven‚Äôt made many big moves the last two weeks. ‚ÄúTrading volume has really dropped off,‚Äù said Scott Wren, a senior global equity strategist at the Wells Fargo Investment Institute. He said investors are being cautious as they wait for the outcome of November‚Äôs election. APPLE CORED: Apple sank $3.05, or 2.6 percent, to $115.20 after it reported another drop in iPhone sales. Apple gets about two-thirds of its revenue from iPhone sales and some investors are concerned it depends too much on its marquee product. The company expects sales to start growing again in the holiday season after a recent slump. The losses for Apple, by far the biggest company in the S&P 500, along with Alphabet and Intel, sent tech stocks lower. That canceled out big jumps in Akamai Technologies and Juniper Networks, which each surged more than 10 percent after strong results. MALLS MAULED: Simon Property Group, which owns more than 100 shopping malls around the country, slumped after analysts worried about its performance, including lower income from stores that have been open for more than a year. That counteracted solid earnings, and its stock fell $8.51, or 4.3 percent, to $188.76. Office space company Boston Properties lost $2.61, or 2.1 percent, to $122.72 after investors were disappointed by its forecasts. CATCHING A CHILL: Drugmaker Merck gave up its gains from the day before and fell $1.19, or 1.9 percent, to $60.76. Medical device maker Edwards Lifesciences reported disappointing sales of heart devices and forecast another shortfall in the current quarter, and its stock slid $17.99, or 15.8 percent, to $95.70. Medical lab operator Laboratory Corp. of America sank $14.17, or 10.2 percent, to $124.24 following a disappointing report. THE QUOTE: Wren said investors don‚Äôt care that much if corporate earnings rise or fall this quarter. Earnings have been falling for more than a year but the drops are getting smaller. ‚ÄúAll the market wants in terms of earnings is a continuation of a pattern this year of quarter-to-quarter improvement,‚Äù he said. BANKS: Financial firms continued to report strong third-quarter results. Regional bank Huntington Bancshares gained 42 cents, or 4.1 percent, to $10.61 and insurer Chubb rose $4.49, or 3.7 percent, to $126.94. BONDS: Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 1.79 percent from 1.76 percent. BOEING GETS GOING: Boeing made its biggest jump since the beginning of 2015. The stock jumped $6.80, or 4.9 percent, to $145.82 after the company raised its forecast for earnings, revenue, and plane deliveries. Boeing is responsible for almost all of the Dow‚Äôs gains. Other industrial companies like Northrop Grumman and Ingersoll-Rand also climbed. SNACK ATTACK: Mondelez, the maker of Oreo cookies, Cadbury chocolate and Trident gum, climbed after reporting a bigger profit than analysts expected. The company‚Äôs stock picked up $1.74, or 4.1 percent, to $44.50. OIL: The price of oil fell for the third day in a row. U.S. crude fell 78 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $49.18 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, lost 81 cents, to 1.6 percent, to $49.98 a barrel in London. CHIPOTLE GETS GRILLED: Mexican food chain Chipotle continued to struggle in its efforts to win back customers after food safety scares that started last year. Its sales fell for the fourth quarter in a row and were worse than analysts expected. The stock lost $38.67, or 9.5 percent, to $367, its lowest price in three years. FASTEN YOUR SEATBELTS: Southwest Airlines gave a weak revenue forecast for the rest of the year. Ticket prices have been falling for two years and Southwest said prices are still ‚Äúsoft‚Äù while its spending grew. The stock lost $3.53, or 8.4 percent, to $38.42. Other airlines including American and United also traded lower. MYLAN MISERY: Drugmaker Mylan fell after investors learned that an allergy injection that competes with Mylan‚Äôs EpiPen shot will go back on sale in 2017. Kaleo Pharmaceuticals‚Äô Auvi-Q was taken off the market last year because of the potential for inaccurate dosing, and EpiPen hasn‚Äôt had direct competition since then. Over the last few months Mylan has come under fire for repeatedly raising the price of EpiPen over the last decade and for overcharging the government for the shot. Mylan stock lost 79 cents, or 2.1 percent, to $37.89 and it‚Äôs down 22 percent since mid-August. OTHER ENERGY TRADING: Wholesale gasoline slid 2 cents to $1.48 a gallon. Heating oil lost 1 cent to $1.55 a gallon. Natural gas fell 4 cents to $2.73 per 1,000 cubic feet. METALS: Gold fell $7 to $1,266.60 an ounce. Silver lost 15 cents to $17.63 an ounce. Copper was little changed at $2.15 a pound. CURRENCIES: The dollar inched up to 104.54 yen from 104.22 yen. The euro rose to $1.0906 from $1.0892. OVERSEAS: The FTSE 100 of Britain dropped 0.8 percent while Germany‚Äôs DAX lost 0.4 percent and the CAC 40 in France gave up 0.1 percent. Japan‚Äôs Nikkei 225 edged 0.2 percent higher, but Hong Kong‚Äôs Hang Seng dropped 1 percent and South Korea‚Äôs Kospi lost 1.1 percent. To sign up for free CityBusiness Daily Updates, click here.

While you were sleeping: UPDATED US stocks mixed, Apple slides on outlook Margreet Dietz Thursday October 27, 2016 Share Play NBR radio on Stocks on Wall Street were mixed amid a disappointing outlook from Apple. Energy stocks fell with the price of oil but Boeing boosted the blue chips. At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 30.06 points, or 0.2%, to 18,199.33. The Nasdaq Composite Index dropped 0.6% to 5250.27 and¬†the Standard & Poor's 500 Index eased¬†0.2% to 2139.43. In the Dow gains in Boeing and Nike shares, trading 4.7% and 1.9% higher respectively, offset slides in Apple and Merck shares, down 2.2% and 2.0% respectively. While Apple's latest quarterly earnings per share exceeded analysts‚Äô expectations, they were disappointed with its outlook for iPhone sales, especially given rival Samsung's woes. "In essence, in China and elsewhere, while Apple's products are still seen favourably, the distance between Apple and its competitors is nowhere near as great as it once was," retail research firm Conlumino head Neil Saunders wrote in a note, according to Reuters. The latest US economic data were better than anticipated. The US trade deficit shrank 5.2% to $US56.1 billion in September, bolstering hope the third-quarter GDP growth might beat expectations. "We now believe the boost from trade could be closer to a full percentage point, almost twice what we had expected," Connecticut-based RBS chief economist Michelle Girard told Reuters. Ms Girard now predicts real GDP growth in the third quarter at 3.3%. Separately, a Commerce Department report showed new home sales rose 3.1% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 593,000 units in September, an unexpected gain. Mondelez improves Mondelez International shares climbed¬†3.6% after the maker of Cadbury chocolate upgraded its full-year profit forecast. The company has increased its full-year adjusted earnings per share outlook and now expects growth of about 25% on a constant-currency basis, Mondelez says. "Our third quarter results underscore our continued commitment to improving operational efficiency, expanding margins and profitably growing volume while also investing in strategic growth initiatives for the longer term," chief executive Irene Rosenfeld says. "In the face of challenging market conditions, we're building a stronger, more streamlined company that is well positioned to deliver sustainable, profitable growth and attractive cash generation." In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index finished the day with a 0.4% slide from the previous close. France's CAC 40 Index slipped 0.1%, Germany's DAX Index dropped 0.4% lower, while the UK's FTSE 100 Index shed 0.9%. Bayer profit up Germany's Bayer, which agreed to buy Monsanto in a $US66 billion deal, reported better than expected quarterly profit bolstered by its pharmaceutical unit. Even so, Bayer shares closed 1.4% lower in Frankfurt as investors are concerned about weakness in its Crop Science division. Pharmaceuticals posted "encouraging" sales growth of 7.6% in the quarter, Consumer Health sales grew 3.6%, while sales of Crop Science were level year-on-year, Bayer says. "Earnings are not strong enough to fuel markets," Dusseldorf-based Bankhaus Lampe equity strategist Ralf Zimmermann told Bloomberg. "Some investors who had expected accelerating earnings may be disappointed." (BusinessDesk) ¬† Got a question about this story? Leave it in Comments & Questions below.

It‚Äôs now¬†late October and we still don‚Äôt have an idea when the AirPods will ship. There could be more to this story than we thought. Apple has informed¬†TechCrunch¬†via a statement that it needs ‚Äúa little more time‚Äù before releasing its AirPods and no longer has plans to ship the headphones in October. Apple went on to say that despite the fact that its AirPods have been well received, it doesn‚Äôt want to ship a product before it‚Äôs ready, so the company has delayed the shipment of the devices. Apple did not say what caused the delay. Back in September MobileSyrup Senior Editor Patrick O‚ÄôRourke reviewed Apple‚Äôs AirPods, and was impressed with their performance and connectivity, titling the review, ‚Äúwelcome to the wireless future.‚Äù We‚Äôll be sure to provide updates when we can, but for now, the wireless future will have to wait a little longer. SourceTechCrunch MXM4K They‚Äôre so easy to lose that Apple themselves lost them, and needs more time finding them‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs Me They don‚Äôt want to rush them out and risk exploding earbuds. Mawhayden Ouch‚Ä¶. Smanny The price is too much for what you are getting, plus there are others that offer a lot more functionality than Apples AirPods, and they work on multiple platforms as well. Some offer CD or HD sound, some offer fitness tracking, and some offer music storage and play back on the earbuds. Some offer a combination of these features and more. Plus all of the others are way more discreet than Apples AirPods. They just sit in your ears. Apples stick out and hang down the side of your face. When it comes to looks, Apples get the lowest marks in my books. It‚Äôs like I would advertising for Apple. But I have to pay them a lot of money to advertise for them. cappein It is definitely possible that the airpods have been exploding pre-shipment, and Apple is infuriatingly trying to fix the issue. It‚Äôs Me Well, they do use Samsung batteries for many of their products‚Ä¶ Supa_Fly BULL. These are basic Bluetooth Stereo headphones. Ericsson was the creator of the tech and certifies the BT stack, SonyEricsson has for over 10yrs made stereo BT headphones and has NEVER missed shipment dates, NEVER! Apple‚Äôs first is delayed and ‚Äúbefore it‚Äôs ready‚Äù then you should‚Äôve have NOT announced it before proper and thorough testing. This reminds me of the PowerMac G4 Cube with bad acrylic forming wtih bubbles and cracks which broke without transport. Jabra will get my money pay day ‚Äì day after this launch was originally expected. Jabra Sport Pulse Jabra Sport Elite. It‚Äôs Me Ok buddy. Never meant to get your panties in a bunch. NEVER. cappein Well, at this point we know it‚Äôs not Samsung ‚Äúbatteries‚Äù that are problematic. So your point seems irrelevant. It‚Äôs Me You know that? Samsung doesn‚Äôt know that. They do probably know it‚Äôs not exclusively an SDI issue but they haven‚Äôt publicly ruled anything out yet. Strange that anyone would claim to know. cappein I don‚Äôt get what you‚Äôre saying. We know that both the SDI and ATL batteries have been exploding. What‚Äôs unknown is the mechanism that leads to the explosion, and therefore, they haven‚Äôt been able to reproduce the problem. In that sense, your argument that ‚Äúthey do use Samsung batteries for many of their products‚Äù and whatever that you‚Äôre implying with it, has nothing to do with this and is completely irrelevant. If the airpods did explode, it would have been Apple‚Äôs design fault that led to the eventual explosion. It‚Äôs Me This week, the head of SDI has admitted there is a defect in their batteries. What other defects contribute isn‚Äôt yet clear. So, perfectly relevant. Also, it was a joke. Lighten up. gommer strike A late product is late, but still has a chance to be good. A prematurely released, and bad product is bad forever. Mr_Smoosh Like the jack-less phone that accompanies these? gommer strike Kinda like the Moto Z and LeEco phones, which removed the headphone jack first? That‚Äôs the thing that all too many ‚Äúno headphone jack‚Äù people all too often refuse to admit. Apple didn‚Äôt do it first(they never do). Always Android. Mr_Smoosh Of course I know apple is never first, my name isn‚Äôt brad. But apple has to take their lumps with the joys of greater press coverage. They introduced a phone with no headphone jack, but not to worry, there‚Äôs magic airpods that are better than mortal bluetooth or archaic wires. Only thing magical so far is the disappearing act. Haseeb Khan A late product is late, but still has a chance to be good. A prematurely released, and a bad product is bad forever. ** üôÇ Bob Loblaw No one wants to wear tampons in their ears. Cowpoke Speak fer yerself, Bobby Blue‚Ä¶ Bob Loblaw Sorry Dolores. Cowpoke Speak up, son‚Ä¶I can‚Äôt hear ya! The Iceman Cometh These are garbage really. It‚Äôs hard enough holding onto a BT-enabled headset without having two separate pieces likes this and not eventually losing them. Another example of design over function. Eluder I disagree about design though in this case, these look hideous, and poorly designed. Therefore they got neither form, nor function here. demigod79 Yeah, Apple has been making some very questionable design decisions of late. First the Apple Watch (among the most ugly smartwatches on the market) and then the Apple Pencil (cannot be holstered, only lasts a day, plus they charge through the butt) and now the most ugly and impractical set of wireless earbuds. Why anyone would shell out so much money for such monstrosities is beyond me! (plus the sound quality is average, based on early reviews/previews) I really wonder how long it will take before tech journalists, and users, start calling out Apple on their BS? I mean, we now know that Apple‚Äôs approach with the iPad Pro (marketing it as a new type of computer) has failed and that the Apple Watch is tanking so fast that it didn‚Äôt even become a chance to become a fad. I‚Äôm guessing shitty products like the AirPods might be the next casualty, although the MacBook or iPhone are strong contenders as well (MS shocked the world with today‚Äôs announcement ‚Äì will see what Apple has to offer tomorrow). TrickyDickie ‚ÄúI really wonder how long it will take before tech journalists, and users, start calling out Apple on their BS?‚Äù Lol! Never. To them, nothing could ever compare to their Apple products. Look at how they make endless excuses for them.. The Iceman Cometh Well I agree because my point is that Apple has chosen a weird design, thinking no doubt its hip and stylish, over the practical reality that these are going to end up being lost more often than not. Cowpoke Well hopefully they are tweakin‚Äô ‚Äôem and improving the sound quality. Roger Apple‚Äôs goal is to make you lose them within a week of buying a pair, and then buy another pair. $$$$$ Cowpoke Right, son, but NO other company on the planet is out to make money‚Ä¶.oh, wait. Roger Since when are you my father? While all for-profit companies are out to make money, some do it more ethically and graciously than others. Cowpoke Sure they do, kid. Sure they do.

By Nick Heath | October 26, 2016, 11:38 AM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus The Microsoft Surface Studio. Image: Microsoft Microsoft took the fight to Apple today, revealing an all-in-one PC targeted at professional designers using Apple Macs. The Surface Studio attaches a high-end desktop computer to what Microsoft claims is the world's thinnest LCD monitor, with a pin-sharp 4,500 x 3,000 resolution. Panos Panay, corporate VP of devices at Microsoft, pitched the machine as competing with the Apple iMac as a drafting table for designers and sketchpad for artists. "We built it for creators, for professionals," he told the crowd at a launch event in New York today. "We want it to transform the way you create and think about creating." He highlighted the machine's high resolution, ability to display more than one billion colors, and present drawings and documents at 1:1 scale with their paper equivalents, saying these features gave professionals the ability to see how their creations would look in the real world. The 28-inch, touchscreen display has 13.5 million pixels, which Microsoft claims is equivalent to about 60 percent higher resolution than a 4K TV, with 192 pixels per inch and a 3:2 aspect ratio. Despite weighing 13 pounds, the 12.5mm thick display feels 'weightless' to move, according to Panay, because of the support and flexibility provided by its counterbalanced hinge, made up of 80 custom parts. The display can be tilted from sitting at a right angle to about a 45-degree angle to a desk's surface, as seen below. When pushed almost flat, the Surface Studio is suited to being used with a Surface Pen, Microsoft's digital pen for writing and drawing on touchscreens, and in the demo at the launch event was shown being used by artists to draw and architects to annotate plans. Helping drive the display is an Intel Core i5 or i7 processor, up to 32GB of DDR4 memory, a 1TB or 2TB 'rapid hybrid drive' and up to an Nvidia GeForce GTX 980M - which Panay says benchmarks around 12,000 on 3D Mark. The Microsoft Surface Dial being used with the Surface Studio Image: Microsoft Complementing the Surface Pen is a new control device called the Surface Dial, which was shown being used with the Studio. The rotatable, brushed-silver dial was shown performing various tasks. Pushing down on it brought up a wheel on the Surface Studio's desktop, from which Panay showed how the dial could be turned to rotate an image on screen or to select a new color while drawing with the Surface Pen. It can also be used to zoom, scroll through documents and for other functions. The Dial can be bought separately from the Studio and is available for $99 for the Surface Pro 3, Surface Pro 4 and the Surface Book. The Surface Studio runs Windows 10, and has a linear mic array in the screen to allow the OS' built-in virtual assistant, Cortana, to hear users from across the room, as well as an HD video camera and 2.1 surround sound speakers. Designed to create minimal clutter, the Studio has a single cable extruding from its aluminum case, which has four USB 3.0, an Ethernet, Mini DP, SD card and 3.5mm audio ports and packs a 270W power supply. The Surface Studio is available to pre-order now from $2,999, with Panay saying they would be available in "limited quantities" over the Christmas period. Richard Edwards, principal research analyst with Ovum, praised the machine for being proof that Microsoft could replicate the eye-catching design of its Surface Book and Surface Pro devices, important when appealing to professionals. "Microsoft still hasn't captured the trendy coffee shop, but it's clearly working on it." He said Microsoft would be hoping to build on the momentum it had captured with its Surface, with Microsoft reporting that both the number and size of deals in the commercial segment for Surface had increased by double digits year on year. However, the high price of the Surface Studio - roughly twice that of the 27-inch Apple iMac - has left Microsoft vulnerable to being undercut, he added. "With Surface Studio, Microsoft has created a new device category - something that Apple is aching to do. At a starting price of $2,999, this premium device leaves lots of room for other PC manufacturers, such as HP, Dell, and Lenovo, but it's clear whom Microsoft is wooing with this device: the creative pro." Edwards also cast doubt on its sales outside of a relatively small group of high-end design professionals. "A visit to the Dell online store points to the real issue: Windows 7, not Windows 10, is what business and corporate buyers are specifying," he said. "Like the iMac, Surface Studio is an exceptional device, by which I mean that the purchase of this device will be the exception rather than the rule. The Surface Studio is without doubt a stunning piece of kit, but city traders, software developers, and CAD engineers are likely, for the time being at least, to stick with the multimonitor display rig connected to Windows 7 PC." While also praising the Surface Studio's design, Mikako Kitagawa, principal research analyst with Gartner, said that even creative professionals, such as graphics designers and architects, may be reluctant to switch to Microsoft's all-in-one PC. "An all-in-one device is not the most cost effective device, as the users pay for both the computing unit and monitor at the same time," she said. "Creative professionals have already invested heavily in hardware and software. For instance, many professional illustrators use a high end drawing tablet and high resolution monitor at the same time." If those same professionals exclusively use macOS, as is the case in some creative outlets, then the high cost of switching to Windows will also be a deterrent, she said. It's also a difficult time to be entering the desktop computer market, with PC sales having been flat or falling for years and forecast to drop a further three percent in 2016. Even sales of Apple Macs, the family of devices home to the iMacs that Microsoft is challenging with its all-in-one PC, were down 500,000 units in the third quarter of 2016 compared with the year before. But with Microsoft warning the Surface Studio would only be available in limited quantities, concerns over the long-term prospects for the hardware may be premature. Microsoft fired more shots over Apple's bow, with the release of the Surface Book i7, a more powerful version of its laptop, with three times the graphics performance of the 'highest end MacBook Pro 13', according to Panay - a title that may not last long if Apple release a new MacBook Pro as expected on Thursday. Panay again talked up the device's appeal to professionals, claiming it would allow designers to run CAD tools 'without lag'. The new Surface Book has, Panay said, twice the graphics performance of its predecessor and a 16-hour battery life, 30 percent more than the previous Surface Book. A thermal redesign and new fan helps prevent the additional graphical processing power from overheating the device. He claimed the device, available for pre-order now from $2,399, is 'pound for pound, the most performant laptop on the market' and will be available in November. The laptop has a sixth-generation Intel Core i7 processor, an Nvidia GeForce GTX 965M with 2GB GDDR5 memory and up to 16GB of RAM. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella took to the stage to drive home the message that Microsoft was focused on empowering 'creators'. "I believe the next 10 years will be defined by technology that empowers profound creation," he told the audience. "At Microsoft, our mission is to empower every person on the planet to achieve more. We are the company that stands for the builders, the makers, the creators."

Finance Search Tue, Nov 15, 2016, 11:33 AM AEDT - Australia Markets close in 4 hrs 27 mins Microsoft aims at Apple with high-end PCs, 3D softwareBy Laura Bonilla | AFP¬†‚Äì¬†Wed, Oct 26, 2016 8:37 PM AEDT Recommend 0 Tweet 0 Share0 Print Related Content View Photo Microsoft chief executive officer Satya Nadella talks at a Microsoft news conference October 26, 2016 in New York Microsoft launched a new consumer offensive Wednesday, unveiling a high-end computer that challenges the Apple iMac along with an updated Windows operating system that showcases three-dimensional content and "mixed reality." The US tech giant announced its first desktop computer, called Surface Studio, a $3,000 high-end "all-in-one" device that aims at creative professionals, a segment dominated by Apple. "We're creating a new category that transforms your desk into a creative studio," Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella said at the unveiling in New York. With a large, 28-inch (71-centimeter) hinged touchscreen display touted as "the thinnest desktop monitor ever created," Surface Studio adds to the Microsoft lineup of tablet and laptop devices for the premium segment. "It is a new class of device that transforms from a desktop PC into a powerful digital canvas, unlocking a more natural and immersive way to create on the thinnest display ever built," said Microsoft vice president Terry Myerson, The new PC has an ultra-HD 4.5K display, offering more pixels than most new high-definition televisions. It will be available in "limited quantities" for the upcoming holiday season, with more units available in 2017. The new device drew a mixed response from analysts. "Yes, this is very cool. But what?s the market for a $3,000 computer you can draw on? How many people have that job?" asked Benedict Evans of the venture firm Andreessen Horowitz in a tweet. But Avi Greengart at the research firm Current Analysis said the new Microsoft products "are aimed at setting the high mark for the Windows ecosystem." Microsoft also announced an updated Surface Book -- its high-end convertible tablet-computer -- which will sell for $2,400, adding improved graphics and computing power and with an estimated 16 hours of battery life. "It's for the people really pushing performance," Microsoft vice president Panos Panay said. The Surface devices allow users to create content onscreen with a special pen-stylus, and Microsoft introduced a new disk device called Dial which attaches to the screen and offers additional controls such as viewing the timeline of a creation. - New ways to create - Microsoft meanwhile announced its Windows 10 Creators operating system would be offered as a free update in early 2017, enabling users to create 3D content and delve into virtual and augmented reality. The update offers "new ways to create and play," said Myerson. The update will allow for a 3D capture application for mobile devices and a new version of the popular program Paint for 3D objects. The system will allow users to add three-dimensional emojis and to create and manipulate content they create or scan. Microsoft general manager Megan Saunders demonstrated how the capture application can scan a sand castle in three dimensions, and then mix that with other content. With the new Windows system, users will be able to experience virtual reality with Microsoft's HoloLens headgear and its Edge browser. Edge "will act as the portal to display 3D content on HoloLens," said Saunders. Microsoft said its hardware partners would be selling Windows-compatible virtual reality gear starting at about $300. Microsoft is aiming to keep users on Windows as many switch to new mobile devices powered by Apple or Google software. Analyst Patrick Moorhead at Moor Insights & Strategy said the move appears positive for Microsoft. "I like where Microsoft is going with Creators Update as it reflects PC differentiation and includes elements of what I believe consumers are interested in, albeit hard to execute upon," Moorhead said. The analyst added that "3D creation is difficult today and Microsoft is taking initial steps to bring it to the masses." With PC sales sputtering, Microsoft has been emphasizing its cloud computing and business services but is also working to stay relevant to consumers with Windows and its various computing and gaming devices. The new version of Windows will help users sift through email and other messages by creating "people" icons that show messages from important connections. @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook Top Stories ¬ª Sydney Airport gets new COOAAP Sydney Airport has appointed chief financial officer Hugh Wehby as the new chief operating officer from January¬†‚Ä¶ Trump to roll back Obama energy policiesAAP SEC Chair says to step down before term endsAFP German travel site trivago files for IPO in USAFP Sponsored ÓÇÄ Market Data Currencies Currencies Name Price Change % Chg AUD / USD 0.7570 +0.0015 +0.19% AUD/USD AUD / GBP 0.6049 +0.0005 +0.08% AUD/GBP AUD / EUR 0.7033 +0.0002 +0.03% AUD/EUR Go To Currency Converter ¬ª On This Site HOME NEWS & OPINION TAX TIME 2016 INVESTING MY PORTFOLIOS PERSONAL FINANCE VIDEO Expert Opinion ALSO ON YAHOO7 Mail Stocks & Shares Forum Meet Single Women Meet Single Men TV Guide Easy Recipe Ideas Go Travelling Tips To Great Sex Breaking News Find Your Dream Car Weather Forecast Find A Job All Yahoo7 Services ¬ª Trending Now Budget Rent a Car Salim Mehajer Travel insurance Pasquale Barbaro Online car insurance quote Julian Assange Free iTunes download NZ earthquake Currency Converter Stephen Bannon Help / Suggestions Privacy Terms Quotes are real-time for NASDAQ, NYSE, and NYSEAmex when available.

(Reuters/Beck Diefenbach) Share Written by Ashley Rodriguez Obsession Glass October 26, 2016 Apple wants viewers to discover shows on Apple TV just like they find new music on Apple Music. The tech company is reportedly working on a new app that will recommend TV shows to viewers through Apple‚Äôs streaming platform, according to USA Today. The app will create customized watch lists for viewers based on the content they stream through Apple TV. Using the app, internally called ‚ÄúWatch List,‚Äù someone who watched AMC‚Äôs The Walking Dead on Apple TV, and also has FX‚Äôs streaming app, might be served a recommendation for The Strain, as an example. Apple is expected to announce the app this week. It‚Äôs unclear when, but the company is hosting an event tomorrow (Oct. 27) at its Cupertino, California headquarters. Apple did not immediately respond to Quartz‚Äôs request for comment. Streaming apps like Spotify and Apple Music have leaned on personalized playlists to differentiate themselves from a crowded sea of music services. Spotify‚Äôs Discover Weekly section, a fan favorite, has 4,500 curated playlists, while Apple has a mammoth catalog of 14,000 playlists, all created within the past year. Both music services, along with others like Pandora and iHeartRadio, tout the power of their playlist-generating algorithms, or their human curators. There‚Äôs still a lot of room to experiment with playlists in the TV realm though. Streaming video apps like Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime Video offer customized recommendations for movies and shows within their apps, based on users‚Äô viewing habits. But there‚Äôs no single app that really lets viewers discover programs across streaming services. Apple already opened the door for this kind of technology. Its current, fourth-generation Apple TV lets users search for movies and TV shows in multiple apps at once using Siri. And at its Worldwide Developer Conference in June, Apple announced that cable subscribers would be able to log in into all their network apps, like NBC and FXNow at once, instead of having to sign into each one separately.

Technology 2 0 0 October 26, 2016 New MacBook Pro 2016 Rumors: Apple Pay, Touch ID, OLED ‚Äì What‚Äôs Apple Showing Off Tomorrow? Kevin Bostic Fans of Apple‚Äôs MacBooks are waiting with bated breath, as the Cupertino tech giant has one more media event scheduled for Thursday, October 27. Word has it that Apple will be showing off new MacBook Pro models, and the newest rumors on the 2016 MacBook Pro update has Apple packing a whole range of new features into its new MacBooks. But just which rumors are the most believable? The newest reports come courtesy of MacRumors, which delved into some of the image resources built into Apple‚Äôs latest macOS update, macOS Sierra 10.12.1. Released yesterday, the new update ‚Äî for the operating system that powers Apple‚Äôs MacBook, iMac, and Mac Pro lines ‚Äî gave Apple sleuths the best indication of what to expect from tomorrow‚Äôs MacBook-focused event. 24 hours to go! Here‚Äôs what we may see from Apple tomorrow. pic.twitter.com/v4YBpbjCbK ‚Äî MacRumors.com (@MacRumors) October 26, 2016 In particular, the macOS update showed images of a MacBook Pro with features just like those that have been rumored for months now. Namely, the MacBook Pro shown in the macOS internal images was missing its top row of function buttons. Instead, the new MacBook appears to have an OLED touch panel at the top of its keyboard where the function keys would normally be placed. What‚Äôs more, there appears to be a Touch ID function ‚Äî a biometric fingerprint reader like those seen in Apple‚Äôs iPads and iPhones ‚Äî built into the power button on one end of the OLED strip. Swapping out the function key row for a new OLED touch panel would allow Apple to make that row into a changeable aspect of the new MacBook Pro. That would allow Apple and other developers to change the information seen on the row depending on the context an application or website requires. What‚Äôs more, the inclusion of Touch ID would allow MacBook Pro users to pay for things on the internet, through applications, and through Apple‚Äôs App and iTunes Stores without having to go through the process of entering their personal information again and again. It could also allow users to log into their MacBooks without entering passwords. Aside from what Apple is expected to call its ‚ÄúMagic Toolbar,‚Äù the 2016 MacBook Pro updates are expected, of course, to see upgraded internals across the MacBook line, with faster, less power-intensive processors built in. The 13-inch MacBook Pro ‚Äì the version seen in the images revealing the Magic Toolbar ‚Äì is also likely to get a new speaker arrangement, with the speakers showing up on the side of the keyboard. Images of New MacBook Pro With Magic Toolbar Leaked in macOS Sierra 10.12.1 https://t.co/sTDVbJTbGL by @julipuli pic.twitter.com/OzxDx1Z5B8 ‚Äî MacRumors.com (@MacRumors) October 25, 2016 As to that keyboard, it looks like it will be one of a number of form factor changes for the 2016 MacBook Pro line. Apple is expected to make the new MacBook Pro models thinner and lighter, and it looks like Apple may be bringing the ‚Äúbutterfly‚Äù keyboard mechanism seen on the Retina MacBook to this year‚Äôs MacBook Pro lineup. That will likely mean a shallower keyboard arrangement, a change that it might take some MacBook Pro fans a bit of time to get used to. As previously reported by the Inquisitr, some other more recent rumors have sprung up regarding the 2016 MacBook Pro that point to significant changes to the MacBook‚Äôs internals. Respected Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo previously pointed to improvements in the MacBook Pro‚Äôs screen‚Äôs energy efficiency, up to 2TB SSD of storage, and a special processor to control the aforementioned Magic Toolbar as likely new additions for the 2016 edition of the MacBook Pro. Rumor also has it that the 2016 MacBook Pro lineup will see Apple ditching the HDMI port, the MagSafe power port, and the SD card slot, a possibility that might see some MacBook Pro fans holding off on upgrading. This year‚Äôs update might see the addition of four USB-C ports, though, so users with cutting-edge peripherals will likely be set for connectivity. That‚Äôs not all that Apple is expected to show off at Thursday‚Äôs media event, but the MacBook Pro upgrade is definitely the most anticipated of Apple‚Äôs revelations. Apple fans might also see new MacBook or MacBook Air models, and there‚Äôs a possibility that Apple will update its iMac lineup. For the most part, though, the MacBook Pro update is expected to be the focus of Apple‚Äôs event, and fans will want to tune in on Thursday, October 27, at 10 a.m. PST to see what Apple has waiting in the wings.

The upcoming model‚Äîthe iPhone 8‚Äîwill reportedly feature a design change that was last used for the iPhone 4s: glass-backed bodies. Japanese news site Nikkei reports, citing a supply chain source, that Apple is working on three new iPhone 8 models and all three will have glass bodies held together with an aluminum frame. Previous rumors hinted that Apple would have one ‚Äúpremium‚Äù glass-back model and two standard models made of aluminum. The glass for the front and back of the devices will be sourced from Biel Crystal Manufactory and Lens Technology in China. Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo told MacRumors¬†glass bodies are both heavier and more fragile than aluminum bodies but technology has advanced so sturdiness and breakage are not concerns. Related Stories Apple Patents Advanced Camera Ahead Of iPhone 8 iPhone 8 Predicted Specs, Features "Apple has tentatively decided that all the 5.5-inch, 5-inch and 4.7-inch models will have glass backs, departing from metal casings adopted by current iPhones, and Biel and Lens are likely to be providing all the glass backs for the new iPhones next year," said Nikkei‚Äôs anonymous source, according to a report. While all three models are believed to have glass bodies, Nikkei reports the premium model will feature a ‚Äúcurved edge-to-edge OLED display‚Äù sourced by Samsung while the other two (a 4.7-inch and a 5.5-inch model) will have the usual LCD displays. Flexible OLED displays offer better viewing angles, superior contrast ratio, truer colors and a faster response time but they are also more vulnerable to water damage and have a shorter lifespan than their LCD counterpart. That said, Apple fans should not get too invested with the notion of front and back glass bodies, as it is too early in the development process to say for sure. It is entirely possible for Apple to make changes to its plans. Consider this: preliminary reports surrounding the iPhone 7 suggested that there would be two iPhone 7 Plus models‚Äîone 5.5-inch model would have a single camera and the other would have dual cameras. In the months leading up to the iPhone 7 launch, Apple reportedly nixed the iPhone 7 Plus single camera model.

In 2.14pm trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average eked out a 0.03 percent advance. The Nasdaq Composite Index dropped 0.7 percent. In 2pm trading, the Standard & Poor‚Äôs 500 Index fell 0.3 percent. In the Dow gains in shares of Boeing and those of Nike, recently trading 4.2 percent and 1.9 percent higher respectively, offset slides in shares of Apple and those of Merck, down 3 percent and 2.2 percent respectively. While Apple‚Äôs latest quarterly earnings per share exceeded analysts expectations, analysts were disappointed with its outlook for iPhone sales‚Äîespecially given the rival Samsung‚Äôs woes. ‚ÄúIn essence, in China and elsewhere, while Apple‚Äôs products are still seen favourably, the distance between Apple and its competitors is nowhere near as great as it once was,‚Äù Neil Saunders, head of retail research firm Conlumino, wrote in a note, according to Reuters. The latest US economic data were better than anticipated. The US trade deficit shrank 5.2 percent to US$56.1 billion in September, bolstering hope that third-quarter GDP growth might beat expectations. ‚ÄúWe now believe the boost from trade could be closer to a full percentage point, almost twice what we had expected,‚Äù Michelle Girard, chief economist at RBS in Stamford, Connecticut, told Reuters. Girard said she now predicts real GDP growth in the third quarter of 3.3 percent. Separately, a Commerce Department report showed new home sales rose 3.1 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 593,000 units in September, an unexpected gain. Mondelez International shares climbed, up 3.6 percent as of 1.35pm in New York, after the maker of Cadbury chocolate upgraded its full-year profit forecast. The company has increased its full-year adjusted earnings per share outlook and now expects growth of about 25 percent on a constant-currency basis, Mondelez said in a statement. ‚ÄúOur third quarter results underscore our continued commitment to improve operational efficiency, expand margins and profitably grow volume while also investing in strategic growth initiatives for the longer term,‚Äù CEO Irene Rosenfeld said in the statement. ‚ÄúIn the face of challenging market conditions, we‚Äôre building a stronger, more streamlined company that is well positioned to deliver sustainable, profitable growth and attractive cash generation,‚Äù Rosenfeld noted. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index finished the day with a 0.4 percent slide from the previous close. France‚Äôs CAC 40 Index slipped 0.1 percent, Germany‚Äôs DAX Index declined 0.4 percent lower, while the UK‚Äôs FTSE 100 Index shed 0.9 percent. Germany‚Äôs Bayer, which agreed to buy Monsanto in a US$66 billion deal, reported better-than-expected quarterly profit bolstered by its pharmaceutical unit. Even so, Bayer shares closed 1.4 percent lower in Frankfurt as investors were concerned about weakness in its Crop Science division. Pharmaceuticals posted ‚Äúencouraging‚Äù sales growth of 7.6 percent in the quarter, Consumer Health sales grew 3.6 percent, while sales of Crop Science were level year on year, Bayer said. ‚ÄúEarnings are not strong enough to fuel markets,‚Äù Ralf Zimmermann, an equity strategist at Bankhaus Lampe in Dusseldorf, Germany, told Bloomberg. ‚ÄúSome investors who had expected accelerating earnings may be disappointed.‚Äù (BusinessDesk) Content Sourced from scoop.co.nz Original url ¬†Print This Post Tweet ¬† ¬† Blogroll China Economic Scan Compare house prices Deposit Rates Direct Broking ‚Äì NZX & ASX Trading & Prices Findata ‚Äì Market Data Good Returns Herald Business Interest.co.nz ‚Äì Interest Rates News & Views National Business Review Property Talk Sharechat Stuff Business Value Cruncher ‚Äì NZX Latest Business news DCC Blocks 2017 Petroleum Offer Theresa Gattung Venture Capital fund Tower estimates quake could trim profit by up to $7.2 mln MYOB awarded Service Provider of the Year Antipodes Gold Reverse Takeover Update Hamilton‚Äôs outlying villages see boost in house hunters New World Kaikoura re-opens NZ dollar little changed below 71 US cents as greenback Unique chance to develop consented lifestyle land in Twizel Candidates for Fonterra Board of Directors‚Äô Election Go Green Expo a breeding ground for pseudoscience Update to Wellington roads Wellington highways closed due to surface flooding When strangers call bearing investment gifts: hang up Fonterra chooses Epson projectors for dynamic edge blending Text Links Recent Comments Lan: Unbelievable that a WEST AUSTR... jackp: Murray, when Key is involved t...

Apple‚Äôs iOS 10.1 contains an important security patch which prevents hackers from hijacking your iPhone or your iPad remotely. What I‚Äôm talking about here is an absolutely horrible flaw, an old iOS 10 vulnerability which goes by the name of¬†CVE-2016-4673. Using this terrible flaw, hackers can basically take over your device by remote. All they have to do is to convince you to click on a cleverly designed piece of malware, which may look as innocent as a PDF, JPEG and/or a font file. You can get the respective malware while cruising a website or via an infected email message, the possibilities are endless. Upon clicking the respective piece of malware, a malicious code is executed on your Apple device, allowing the hacker to take full control over your iPhone or iPad. The good news is that Apple rolled out their latest¬†iOS 10.1 and I strongly advise you to upgrade as soon as possible. The new mobile OS addresses the aforementioned vulnerability (remote-exec-flow)together with other things, eleven bugs fixes and other security flaws/updates: a remote code execution bug in Webkit, local code exec vulnerabilities, a flaw in contacts that will permit an app to view your Address Book details even if it doesn‚Äôt have access privileges (they were revoked) etc. If you‚Äôre using an older version of iOS, you should update your precious right now, that if¬† you don‚Äôt want to become some Russian kid‚Äôs drone in a Bot Net. And if you remember the massive DoS attack from last week, well, that‚Äôs what Bot Nets do, they take over various devices (including smartphones) which are later used to flood/take down websites. To update your iPhone or iPad, just go to Settings, General, Software Update.

TrustedReviews Facebook Twitter Googleplus TVs & Audio Cameras Computing Mobile Home appliances Gaming Competitions Desktop PCs Internet Laptops Monitors PC Components Peripherals More Printers Software Trending: iOS 10 Apple Watch 2 iPhone 7 Galaxy S7 vs iPhone 6S Google Pixel Galaxy S7 Home / Opinions / Microsoft Surface Studio vs iMac Microsoft Surface Studio vs iMac by Andrew Williams 26 October 2016 0 shares Read Comments Which is the best all-in-one PC? The Surface Studio is Microsoft‚Äôs long-awaited all-in-one PC alternative to the Apple iMac. To date no Windows AIO has managed to get close to toppling the mighty iMac. Most people couldn‚Äôt even name a Windows computer of this type. That‚Äôs about to change, but how does the Microsoft Surface Studio compare to Apple‚Äôs most desirable desktop? Here are our early thoughts. Surface Studio vs iMac ‚Äì Design There are several different versions of the iMac. Screen sizes start at 21.5 inches, resolutions at 1080p. However, the model closest to the Surface Studio is the 27-inch 5K iMac. That said, all iMac models bear the classic glass and metal design Apple has used for years. It looks great and is slim, but there‚Äôs a fairly hefty metal ‚Äúlip‚Äù on all models of the iMac. This matches the metal stand for an instantly recognisable look. See an iMac in a movie and you‚Äôll know what it is, even if they block out the Apple logo. The Microsoft Surface Studio has less character to its design, but perhaps a more modern look as a result. By fitting all the components into the base rather than behind the display, Microsoft has managed the screen itself incredibly slim. Apple manages to make the iMac look skinny in pictures, but it actually bulges out significantly towards the centre. At just 12.5mm thick, the Surface Studio display looks more like a tablet than a computer monitor. That‚Äôs somewhat apt too, as unlike the iMac the Studio has a touchscreen. The machine‚Äôs casing is all-aluminium, and two chrome metal bars join screen to base, where the brains live. What we see here are two totally different approaches to designing an AiO. Microsoft‚Äôs is much less like a traditional desktop PC, as the hinge display stand allows it to fold almost flat, letting you approach it like a gigantic tablet if you like. The iMac just tilts a little. It‚Äôs a much stiffer design. Surface Studio vs iMac ‚Äì Connectivity Like other AiOs, the Surface Studio and iMac don‚Äôt have a mind-bending array of connections, but both offer enough for most people, including the pros. The iMac has an Ethernet socket, four USB 3.0s and two Thunderbolt 2 ports on the rear, alongside a SDXC card slot and a headphone jack. The Surface Studio has four USB 3.0s, a mini DisplayPort, audio jack and an SDXC card slot. They all sit on the back edge of the base. Other iMac features include a pair of fairly good down-firing speakers hidden away in the back, and an HD FaceTime 1.2-megapixel camera at the top of the screen for video calling. The studio has a "2.1" speaker array, meaning it has two main drivers and a bass one, and an HD webcam that supports Windows Hello. This new-ish feature lets you sign into Windows with your face, rather than a password. Related: 5K iMac 27-inch review Surface Studio vs iMac ‚Äì Display Apple offers several iMac display options. The base-level iMac has a 21.5-inch Full HD screen. Moving up the series, the Retina version comes with a 21.5-inch 4K screen and the ability to support up to 4,096 x 2,304 pixels on an external display. The one we really care about is the top-end 5K model, though. It has native resolution of 5120x2880 and can output to two 4096x2160 other displays or one 5120x2880 dual-cable display. Microsoft‚Äôs Surface Studio resolution is slightly lower, but still liable to blow the minds of those who haven‚Äôt used a PC like this before. It‚Äôs a 192ppi, 3:2 aspect display of 28 inches across, its resolution 4500 x 3000 pixels. It has a squatter aspect than the iMac. Resolution is not the most important factor for many pros, though. Colour accuracy is. Apple‚Äôs 5K iMac is calibrated to satisfy the DCI P3 colour standard, used in film production. It‚Äôs a great display. We won‚Äôt know quite how well the Surface Studio will fare in a colorimeter test yet, but at the launch Microsoft showed the computer hot-swapping between sRGB and DCI P3 colour standards. That there was no explicit mention of the Adobe RGB, which digs deeper into the red spectrum, suggests it might not be able to hit 100 per cent of that standard. But then neither can the 5K iMac, or many monitors under ¬£1000. Both machines use LCD displays with 10-bit colour. The Microsoft Surface Studio display also has a completely different side the iMac doesn‚Äôt even touch. Part of the justification for the touchscreen and the weird-looking hinge is that the display can be laid almost flat, to 20 degrees, turned into a creative drawing surface. As well as a touchscreen, there‚Äôs a Studio pen that lets you treat the display a little like a Wacom graphics tablet, although Microsoft hasn‚Äôt yet talked about its pressure sensitivity. For a guide, the Surface Pro 4‚Äôs pen offers 1,024 levels: not bad at all. There‚Äôs also a radial controller that you stick on the screen to let you alter certain settings without having to take pen away from the surface with supported apps. Microsoft showed-off comparable ‚Äòobject recognition‚Äô in the original Surface Table from years ago. One demo of the Surface Dial was an artist using it to roll back changes in a drawing. Creative professional are often prone to droning on about how much they love their Macs, but the Surface Studio is starting to look like a good reason to switch over. Need more? Palm rejection support is in and the pen seems to offer (near) zero-lag input that sounds similar to that of the iPad Pro. Related: Best desktop PC Surface Studio vs iMac ‚Äì Hardware versus Pricing There are many variants of iMac, as you‚Äôd expect for a family that has been around for almost 20 years. Let‚Äôs concentrate on the comparison that matters, what you get for the $3000 the Surface Studio will cost. Playing with the Apple Store‚Äôs configurator, you can get a quad-core Intel i7 (4GHz), 32GB RAM, 2TB Fusion drive and AMD Radeon M395 (2GB) for $3149. Close enough. At $3000 Microsoft‚Äôs specs are much lower: an Intel Core i5, 8GB RAM, a 1TB hybrid drive and an Nvidia GeForce GTX965M CPU. Let‚Äôs turn the heat up. The top Microsoft Surface Studio costs $4199 and has an Intel Core i7, 32GB RAM, 2TB hybrid drive storage and an Nvidia GTX980M GPU. Apple‚Äôs top spec costs $4099, but is a little different with a faster 1TB SSD instead of a hybrid drive and a much inferior Radeon R9 M395X GPU. However, Microsoft‚Äôs use of last-gen graphics cards is quite disappointing. These days fairly conventional gaming laptops manage to fit in much more powerful GTX1070 and GTX1080 cards. We don‚Äôt yet have UK prices, but here‚Äôs the full list of US Microsoft Surface Studio specs: $2999 ‚Äî 8GB/1TB/Core i5/GTX 965M $3499 ‚Äî 16GB/1TB/Core i7/GTX 965M $4299 ‚Äî 32GB/2TB/Core i7/GTX 980M Apple‚Äôs spec configs are more malleable, but here‚Äôs how the whole series pans out: 21in 1080p iMac Starts at $1099 ‚Äî 8GB/1TB HDD/Core i5 dual/Integrated GPU 21in 4k iMac Starts at $1499 ‚Äî 8GB/1TB HDD/Core i5/Integrated GPU 27in 5K iMac Starts at $2299/¬£1449 ‚Äî 8GB/1TB HDD/Core i5/R9 M380 Buy Now: 5K iMac 27-inch at Amazon.com from $1,899.99 Best Deals for Apple 5K iMac 27-inch 2015 Surface Studio vs iMac ‚Äì Included accessories Both of these all-in-one PCs include the basics you need to get started All iMacs models come with Apple's Magic wireless mouse and keyboard. However, you may also want to get hold of the excellent Magic Trackpad 2, which costs an additional ¬£109. After spending years selling Surface tablets without their keyboards as standard, we‚Äôre glad to see Microsoft hasn‚Äôt left anything glaring out of the Surface Studio package. You get a Surface Pen, Mouse and Keyboard. These appear to be similar to those Apple offers, the main difference being the mouse has a metal scroll wheel. The Surface Dial is an extra, costing $99 (UK price TBC), but given not all buyers would make extensive use of one, turning this into an optional extra seems sensible. Surface Studio vs iMac ‚Äì Software Thankfully, the software side of things is mercifully simple compared to the hardware side. Put simply, the iMacs come with the latest macOS Sierra, while Microsoft will provide you with its Windows 10 Pro OS on the Studio. Which you prefer will come down to numerous factors, but it's likely to hinge on which OS you're used to. If you are familiar with both, you still might find one provides better software for the particular tasks you work on, whether it's graphic design, sound production, video editing or just plain old word processing. It's therefore pretty difficult to say which side wins out here. Both operating systems offer some impressive features and now both feature a digital assistant, with Cortana providing the virtual help on Windows and macOS now coming with Siri. Apple tends to pack in a load of extra apps for use with its system, so if you plan on getting into some music production or basic video editing, macOS might be for you. Alternatively, Windows 10 continues to improve, with Microsoft recently adding a load of improvements with its latest update. And when the Studio arrives, it should come with the just-announced 'Creators update' which apparently makes '3D for everyone' , which means there's a new 3D version of MS Paint. Surface Studio vs iMac ‚Äì Summary We have not yet reviewed the Surface Studio, but we loved the iMac 27in 5K. It was one of the few products, ever, to achieve a perfect 10. However, where the iMac is simply a very nice all-in-one PC, the Surface Studio is something more. Its versatile hinge and stylus-ready screen make it a potential design tool you'd need a separate graphics tablet to replicate in an iMac. It's more expensive than a 27in 5K iMac too, which is quite an achievement. The Studio is also the best gaming AIO PC we've seen, in its top-spec iteration, although we're a little disappointed Microsoft didn't go even further and use Nvidia's excellent latest-gen cards. We'll be back with the final verdict once we've reviewed the Surface Studio. Watch The Refresh: The best tech gossip and reviews every week Let us know which you prefer in the comments.

That‚Äôs an increase of $6.1 billion from the previous quarter,¬†Apple CFO¬†Luca Maestri said during the company‚Äôs earnings call.¬†He noted that $216 billion, or 91 percent, is held outside the United States. That amount, $216 billion, was Apple‚Äôs total cash hoard at the end of 2015. The company held about 93 percent of that overseas at the time, according to a Moody‚Äôs report. The year before that, the company was said to have kept $181 billion overseas, according to a study we wrote about then. The Silicon Valley tech giant has been slammed for years over how much cash it keeps abroad. However, CEO Tim Cook said during an interview with Irish radio last month¬†that the company was planning to bring billions of dollars in profit to the U.S. next year. That plan was not addressed during yesterday‚Äôs call. Prior to that interview, Cook had repeatedly said the company pays its fair share of taxes. He had called for changes in U.S. corporate tax laws, such as the 35 percent¬†federal rate on repatriated profit. As for what Apple‚Äôs going to do with all that money, Cook said during Tuesday‚Äôs call that the company continues to look at acquisitions. In addition, the company‚Äôs R&D spending climbed to $1.9 billion in the last fiscal year, up from $1.54 billion in the previous year. Apple shares continue to fall today after their after-hours drop Tuesday. They‚Äôre down nearly¬†2.5 percent to about $115.38. ¬† Photo:¬†The Apple logo hangs on the Apple Store on Fifth Avenue on Aug. 5, 2015 in New York City.

The massive profits are of course the result of massive margins on products that are made low-cost abroad.

In the process, it confirmed the most notable change coming to the new MacBook Pro generation: the laptop is getting a touch-based secondary display that will offer app shortcuts and a Touch ID fingerprint scanner. However, the change also brings over an unexpected problem that early buyers will have to fix. DON‚ÄôT MISS:¬†iPhone 7 vs. Pixel real-world speed test: The showdown we‚Äôve been waiting for By removing the top row of keys, Apple is also eliminating the escape key, one of the most commonly used keys on the keyboard. Sure, a shortcut for it might¬†be found in the same position on the OLED Magic Toolbar. But if that isn't¬†enough, then you should know you can fix it. You‚Äôll simply have to assign the escape shortcut to a different key, and macOS Sierra lets you do that. Apple included in macOS 10.12.1 the option to remap the escape key to a different key, 9to5Mac reports. You‚Äôll have to head to System Preferences, then Keyboard, and then Modifier Keys. Then you‚Äôll have to select escape key from the drop-down box next to the hardware key you want to assign it to. Once that‚Äôs done, you‚Äôll have a dedicated¬†escape key again if the Magic Toolbar doesn't¬†satisfy your needs.¬†macOS 10.12.1¬†will likely be rolled out once the 2016 MacBook Pro is available for sale.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Some of the best combos come in pairs: peanut butter and jelly; chips and guacamole; Kobe and Shaq. But the very best things come in threes, a philosophy Apple will apparently adopt next year. According to Nikkei Asian Review, citing anonymous sources, Apple will reportedly introduce a 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch iPhone in 2017‚Äîsomething we‚Äôve been expecting. A third 5-inch option will allegedly be added to the lineup, too, making Apple‚Äôs mobile portfolio even more diverse. From Nikkei Asian Review: Apple has tentatively decided that all the 5.5-inch, 5-inch, and 4.7-inch models will have glass backs, departing from metal casings adopted by current iPhones‚Ä¶ We‚Äôve been hearing Apple would be opting for an all-glass design similar to the iPhone 4 and iPhone 4s, and Nikkei‚Äôs report further corroborates the rumor. The devices will also feature some kind of metal casing‚Äîeither steel or aluminum, according to the report. Previous reports have said the iPhone 8 will sport a curved design and a bezel-less OLED screen with a fingerprint sensor that‚Äôs built into the display. Considering next year will mark the tenth anniversary of the iPhone, Apple is reportedly gearing up to make next year‚Äôs revamp a significant one. That might include, according to Nikkei, a third 5-inch iPhone. The iPhone 7 barely just launched but given the importance of next year‚Äôs release, it‚Äôs no surprise that the rumor mill is already humming along.

Apple‚Äôs previous construction schedule listed an expected end date for building construction and street utility work as the end of Q3 of this year. The updated schedule extends that three months until the start of 2017. It also notes the beginning and expected end date for landscaping and sitework, which Apple officially began in recent weeks and plans¬†to complete by the second quarter of 2017, after its last known estimated move-in date. The images above and below show the exterior of the Campus 2 site as of mid-October. As of earlier this year, Tim Cook informed employees during an internal meeting that the company planned to start moving in by the end of January 2017. It‚Äôs unclear if the updated general construction schedule might mean possible delays for the project, or if Apple still plans its January move in timeframe while it continues landscaping work into March of next year. Apple‚Äôs October 27 MacBook event this week could be its last big product unveiling before the company moves into the new Campus 2. Once it does, it‚Äôs expected to use a new 1000 seat underground on-site auditorium known as ‚ÄúApple Theatre‚Äù to host future events.¬†The 176-acre campus also includes on-site R&D facilities, a 100,000 sq ft fitness center, and other facilities separate from the main building that will hold more than¬†13,000 employees in¬†2.8 million sq ft of office space.

Expects iPhone Prices to Surge iPhone ASPs should approach $700 once again. Evan Niu (TMFNewCow) Oct 26, 2016 at 2:36PM This dual-camera system is why the iPhone 7 Plus cost $20 more than it used to. Image source: Apple. Over the past few quarters, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has seen a dramatic drop in iPhone average selling prices (ASPs). This isn't entirely a bad thing, nor unexpected. The main reason for the recent decline was the launch of the iPhone SE, which starts at $400. That's the lowest price point that Apple has ever sold an iPhone for directly, even after taking into account its strategy of cascading older iPhone models down to successively lower prices. The iPhone SE caters to consumers that prefer smaller phones, as well as entry-level first-time smartphone adopters in emerging markets. ASPs should bounce back in Q4 Given the launch, a drop in ASPs makes perfect sense. The good news is that Apple expects iPhone ASPs to surge again in the fourth quarter. For the record, Apple just reported iPhone ASPs of $619, which was a sequential improvement of $24. This trend is expected to continue into the holiday shopping season, according to CFO Luca Maestri: iPhone ASP increased to $619 in the September quarter, which was above our expectations. That's up from $595 in the June quarter when we launched iPhone SE and we had a significant channel inventory reduction. We expect iPhone ASP to increase markedly on a sequential basis to a level similar to our ASP in the December quarter last year. In the December quarter of 2015, iPhone ASP was $691; Apple is setting expectations that investors could enjoy a hefty jump in ASPs of around $70. Here's how iPhone ASPs have performed over the past two years. Data source: SEC filings. Calendar quarters shown. Chart by author. In 2014, Apple implemented a new storage pricing structure, where the first $100 step up quadrupled storage from 16 GB to 64 GB. Combined with the fact that 16 GB is paltry, the result was strong upsell activity and a subsequent jump in ASPs. Now we're giving back some of those gains for the iPhone SE. Fair is fair The key to realizing such a meaningful ASP jump will be fulfilling iPhone 7 Plus demand. Apple says that while demand for iPhone 7 is already robust, the 7 Plus is off the charts and the company is having particular difficulty keeping up. It will also help that this year, Apple tacked on a $20 price bump for the iPhone 7 Plus, which now starts at $869 instead of $849. That increase may seem negligible from a consumer point of view (just 2%), which is kind of the point. It's easily justifiable for the consumer, and it will help boost ASPs to the extent that sales are concentrated on the larger model. When asked about the $20 price increase, CEO Tim Cook attributed it to the new dual-camera system that is exclusive to the 7 Plus. Cook also reiterated that Apple's goal is always to "charge a fair price" -- no more, no less. Evan Niu, CFA owns shares of Apple. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Apple.

However, the OLED switch¬†could be short-lived as Apple is said to be adopting emerging Micro-LED display panels. Micro-LED screens could debut on 2017 Apple Watch models. Micro-LEDs range in size from one micron to one hundred microns. Skating to where the puck‚Äôs going to be, Apple in May 2014 bought Micro-LED developer LuxVue Technology, adding their¬†talent¬†to¬†to its hardware innovations team. The iPhone maker also set up an R&D center in Taiwan to research Micro-LEDs. Here‚Äôs a technology primer providing a layman‚Äôs overview of the current state of Micro-LED technology and how it could benefit Apple by helping its¬†teams engineer devices that would rock¬†longer-lasting batteries and have significantly brighter screens. The benefits of Micro-LED panels Micro LED technology provides the following benefits: Micro-LEDs¬†could¬†improve battery power by as much as 300 percent. Micro-LEDs eliminate the need for backlighting unlike traditional LCDs. Micro-LEDs allow for higher-resolution screens with improved color gamut than other display technologies. Micro-LEDs provide two to three times the brightness of their OLED counterparts under the same power consumption. Micro-LEDs require much less investment than traditional TFT LCD display panels to reach economies of scale. Micro-LED chips¬†are so small that a five-inch 400-by-600 pixel smartphone panel requires nearly one million and a 4K TV panel about 50 million¬†chips. As¬†Micro-LED technology is still in its infancy, initial R&D and production costs are higher than costs related to OLED/TFT development. Who builds these Micro-LEDs? Currently, both Apple and Samsung are secretly developing Micro-LEDs. Realizing they cannot¬†compete with major tech giants on their own, government-sponsored Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) is looking to¬†organize 20+ Taiwanese firms into a consortium beginning¬†November 2016. The consortium includes Taiwan-based Micro-LED makers, LED material makers, integrated circuitry design firms, packaging and testing service providers, TFT-LCD panel makers and system product makers. ITRI has been developing Micro-LED technology for a while now and is progressing toward small-volume trial production in early-2017. Based on existing development and established supply chain of Micro-LEDs, the possibility of successful development of Micro-LEDs in terms of commercial applicability is about 50 percent, according to Electronic and Optoelectronic System Research Laboratories (EOSRL) general director Wu Chih-I. Micro LEDs will be first applied to small-size displays like¬†smartwatches, virtual reality or augmented reality devices. As¬†production cost decreases over time, Micro-LEDs¬†should make their¬†way into smartphones, TVs and PCs. Apple and LuxVue Which brings us to LuxVue, a Micro-LED developer Apple acquired in 2014 and confirmed¬†the purchase with a boilerplate¬†statement saying, ‚ÄúWe buy smaller technology companies from time to time, and we generally do not discuss our purpose or plans.‚Äù LuxVue has been stealthily working on low-power Micro-LED-based displays for consumer electronics. Last year, it announced a technical breakthrough in displays. At the core of Micro-LED technology is mass transfer of small chips, which is currently challenged by balancing cost and yield rate.¬†LuxVue‚Äôs breakthrough appears to revolve around using unique electrostatic adhesion for mass transfer of chips. By contrast, other Micro-LED makers use vacuum pressure. As it stands, vacuum pressure is cheaper and simpler than LuxVue‚Äôs method,¬†but has low yield rates. Incorporated in 2009, LuxVue has its headquarters in Santa Clara, California. The firm was formerly known as Papierlos Corporation. Its VP¬†of Technology, Kapil Sakariya, worked at Apple from July 2006 until November 2011 as a Display Architect and iPhone Operations and Procurement Manager. The firm¬†received $43 million in funding from Kleiner Perkins, iD Ventures America and others on top of $18 million¬†and¬†$25.2 million it raised in 2013. Most importantly, LuxVue was granted a bunch of patents related to commercialization of Micro-LEDs, which are now owned by Apple.¬†These include¬†four inventions providing methods¬†for using¬†a sapphire layer in a semiconductor device. Interestingly enough, an Apple patent for a 3D camera system specifically mentions using a light source in the form of LEDs to¬†transilluminate a transparency with optical radiation so as to project a pattern onto the object. According to the patent abstract, the system ‚Äúcaptures an image of the pattern that is projected onto the object‚Äù¬†while a CPU¬†‚Äúprocesses the image so as to reconstruct a three-dimensional map of the object.‚Äù Even more interestingly, Apple‚Äôs patent for a 3D camera system credits as its inventor Kelly McGroddy, who was Director of LED Technology at LuxVue. EETimes said in June 2015 that¬†Micro-LEDs could be used for ‚Äúdirect projection displays‚Äù that¬†would include¬†augmented and virtual reality applications¬†like a rumored VR/AR headset Apple‚Äôs been reportedly working on. The article¬†explained that Micro-LED displays¬†would be ideally suited for wearable devices and VR/AR headsets¬†due to their¬†‚Äúlow footprint, low power consumption, high-contrast ratio and ultra-high brightness.‚Äù At 2013 Disrupt SF, KPCB partner John Doerr¬†said¬†LuxVue‚Äôs technology could¬†improve battery power by a whopping 300 percent compared to the usual 1-2 percent improvements that we normally see in the industry. Micro-LEDs could easily become ‚Äúthe biggest, the single most disruptive thing, the game changer‚Äù in the industry, said Doerr.¬†‚ÄúIf you can find a way to double or triple the energy density, then you need less stuff to make it and it weighs less,‚Äù he explained. OLED or Micro-LED iPhones? So, will a future iPhone have a display based on OLED or Micro-LED technology? If you ask¬†Innolux CEO Wang Jyh-chau, OLEDs won‚Äôt replace LCDs as mainstream display technology anytime soon because OLED panels are still pricey and difficult to manufacture in volume compared to LCDs. Wang thinks Apple will¬†likely adopt OLEDs for 2017 iPhones for the sake of product differentiation, but is uncertain whether it will be on a long-term basis‚Äîespecially when Apple is thought to be developing Micro-LEDs on its own. It‚Äôs ‚Äútoo early to determine the prospect of Micro-LEDs,‚Äù he said. According to Taiwan-based supply chain makers, Apple in April 2015 established a facility in northern Taiwan solely dedicated to researching Micro-LED technology. Summing up Keep in mind that it‚Äôs unclear if Apple has completed its purchase of LuxVue. If not, chances are future Apple devices may¬†gradually switch from the current power-hungry LCD panels to the more energy-efficient OLED or AMOLED screens. Apple currently uses OLEDs for the Apple Watch while iOS devices and Macs¬†rely on¬†the premium LCD IPS display technology. Still, LCD displays are a tremendous battery hog because they require a backlighting as opposed to OLED or Micro-LED panels. A Micro-LED screen would give a future iPhone at least¬†two to three times the OLED brightness under the same power consumption. And given¬†OLEDs¬†are¬†already significantly more power efficient than LCDs, iPhones and other devices outfitted with Micro-LED panels would waste far less battery power compared to LCDs while boosting display resolution, clarity and brightness. Alternatively,¬†Apple could initially limit deployment of Micro-LEDs on flat-screened devices before¬†rolling them out¬†to curved or flexible-screen gadgets such as the Apple Watch or a 2017 iPhone with a wraparound display. No matter how you look at it, the purchase of LuxVue could make a future iPhone‚Äôs battery life better than it‚Äôs ever been. And that‚Äôs¬†exactly¬†what a lot of¬†people have been clamoring for.

Rowan09 How many hours does the S7 Edge get for example? Answer the same as my 6S Plus and less than my 7Plus. It‚Äôs more than just the battery size and screen tech. jOn Garrett My S7 edge lasts a very long time. If I need it to last longer I can go to ultra power saving mode or a 20 minute charge up will give me nearly 50% I don‚Äôt even have to have a charger or cable of my own, most fast-food and all Starbucks around me have wireless charging mats which is awesome‚Äìcharging my phone while I have a cup of coffee. Rowan09 Still didn‚Äôt answer the question. I own the S7 Edge and when I left my iPhone 6S Plus at home and used it I had to charge it twice at work. Compared to not once with the iPhone 6S Plus rockdude094 Actually the S7 Edge would obliterate the iPhone 7 plus if you enabled the robust power saving modes it has. Lets not forget that the S7 has fast charging.. it will go from 0-100 % in little over an hr. I can go on and on about its feature but it falls on deaf fan boys ears. I have both phones so I‚Äôve compared both to one another in every aspect Rowan09 You mean make the phone useless mode? Come on man I‚Äôm talking about regular usage.

Shares of Apple fell as much as 3.7 percent - set for their worst day in six months - after the company said sales of its flagship iPhones fell for the third quarter in a row. The world's most valuable public company recovered some losses in later trading and was last down 2.8 percent. Excluding Apple, earnings are expected to rise 2.9 percent. "The markets have been rallying in anticipation of good numbers and earnings have been coming in a little bit soft," said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago. A rally by Boeing boosted the Dow. Boeing shares were trading at their highest level this year, after the world's largest planemaker reported a jump in quarterly profit despite slower sales. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 18.83 points, or 0.1 percent, to 18,188.1, the S&P 500 lost 5.21 points, or 0.24 percent, to 2,137.95 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 35.47 points, or 0.67 percent, to 5,247.93. Disappointing results and forecasts from some other major U.S. companies continued to weigh on European and Asian stocks. Mixed results from Europe's banking sector and declines in mining and energy shares helped push the pan-European STOXX 600 index down 0.38 percent. Oil prices bounced off session lows for a time after the U.S. government reported a surprise drawdown in crude inventories. But oil headed negative on growing doubts that OPEC would cut production enough to drain a global oversupply. U.S. crude oil futures settled at $49.18 a barrel, down 78 cents or 1.56 percent. They had dipped to $48.87, the lowest since Oct. 4. Brent crude was down 91 cents, or 1.79 percent, at $49.88 at 2:36 p.m. ET (1836 GMT), their weakest level in nearly a month. CARNEY EFFECT In currency markets, sterling recovered from Monday's lows after Bank of England (BoE) governor Mark Carney said in a speech the central bank could not ignore the effect of sterling's slide on inflation. This increased expectations that policymakers would leave rates unchanged next week, rather than cut them as many had expected. Sterling rose 0.35 percent to $1.2229, coming off Monday's trough of $1.2081, which was the lowest level since the Oct. 7 "flash crash". The euro, which had slid to a 7 1/2-month low of $1.0851 on Tuesday, was up 0.2 percent to $1.0908. With investors looking ahead to U.S. third-quarter gross domestic product data on Friday, the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six global peers, fell 0.12 percent to 98.604. It hit its highest level since Feb. 1 on Tuesday as traders saw a better than 78-percent chance of an interest rise hike by the Federal Reserve in December, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool. The dollar extended modest gains against the yen, hitting a session high of 104.44 yen.

Share with your friends Your Name Your Email Recipient Email Enter a Message I read this article and found it very interesting, thought it might be something for you. The article is called Laptop Dilemma: Surface Book or MacBook Pro? and is located at http://www.starkinsider.com/2016/10/laptop-dilemma-macbook-pro-surface-book.html. Captcha Submit CLOSE Culture Tech/SV Wanderlust Interviews Video Features Culture Tech/SV Wanderlust Interviews Video Features Tech & Silicon Valley Laptop Dilemma: Surface Book or MacBook Pro? Microsoft is on a fierce comeback. Who ever thought a Windows laptop would be a viable alternative to the vaunted MacBook? That day is here. By Clinton Stark - 10.26.2016 UPDATE 10.27.2016: Apple has just unveiled a trio of updated MacBook Pros for 2016 (13‚Ä≥, 13‚Ä≥ with Touch Bar, 15‚Ä≥ with Touch Bar). As expected they‚Äôre smaller, lighter, faster. And, also as predicted, the OLED ‚ÄúTouch Bar‚Äù has arrived. It‚Äôs pretty impressive, dynamically changing and presenting softkeys depending on the task at hand. Beautifully conceived and executed. Though, the greedy in me would like Apple to give us both a Touch Bar and touch screen. Bonus points for Apple not killing off the headphone jack. Thank you! So: Microsoft Surface Book with Performance Base and Apple 15‚Ä≥ MacBook Pro entry configs are both ‚Äî surprise ‚Äî the same price: $2,399 (USD). I‚Äôm still on the fence. Love touch screen, creative potential of Surface Book. Yet, MacBooks are so robust and you just know that touchpad and touch bar will be superbly engineered. Decisions, decisions. If you‚Äôre like me you‚Äôve waited a long time for this week. I‚Äôm ready to finally upgrade my aging 2012 MacBook Air. And there‚Äôs finally new product hitting the market. Today, Microsoft revealed the stunning Surface Studio 28‚Ä≥ all-in-one PC wonder. It looks amazing ‚Äî as does the price. Call it an iMac on steroids. But it was the refreshed Surface Book that caught my attention. Microsoft is really onto something with this hybrid tablet/laptop design. You can pop off the screen, thanks to an innovative hinge (somewhat like those seen on an articulating bus), and voila, it‚Äôs a 13.5-inch Windows tablet. With¬†the Surface Pen you can doodle, draw up story boards, and take hand written notes. And, for the first time, the touchpad¬†and speakers rival those of its Apple counterparts. At $2,399 (USD) and up for the new ‚ÄúPerformance Base‚Äù edition of the Surface Book, the premium Apple-like positioning does require a Tylenol or two to be sure. Then again, I‚Äôve gone four years with my current laptop, so I can (somewhat) justify the expense. Maybe. Per The Verge, the updated model is all about the internals. There‚Äôs not much change to the overall design, though the stone¬†in our collective shoes: it‚Äôs actually slightly heavier (now 3.63 pounds) and fatter. Early hands-on feedback suggests it‚Äôs not a big deal, and barely noticeable. Sadly, the Surface Book doesn‚Äôt yet use Intel‚Äôs latest Kaby Lake chips. On the upside you get an Nvidia GeForce 965M GPU, and a battery rated by Microsoft at 16 hours. Not too shabby. Update: it also looks like Microsoft has reduced the infamous ‚Äúgap‚Äù when the Surface Book is closed (hopefully Surface Book 2 will completely eliminate it). Apple is up next. Tomorrow (October 27, 2016) it‚Äôs widely expected Apple will finally unveil refreshed MacBooks. Early word suggests the trick feature (and marketing emphasis) will be¬†the so-called ‚ÄúMagic Toolbar.‚Äù Gone are the traditional row of function keys along the top of the keyboard. In its place is a touch strip featuring an OLED display. It can, according to early reports and leaks, dynamically change based on context. If you‚Äôre in Lightroom you get photo editing shortcuts. In Premiere, video editing controls. In Microsoft Word, doc editing shortcuts. And on and on: It looks pretty cool to be sure, but part of me wonders: is this is a solution looking for a problem? I‚Äôm not so sure it‚Äôs the game-changer some are suggesting. We‚Äôll know more tomorrow when Apple does its song and dance. Interestingly, as I wrote yesterday on Stark Insider, Microsoft and its touch-friendly philosophy encourages us to touch the screen while Apple is apparently the opposite inviting us to only touch the keyboard and its new dynamic function strip. My current mindset has me favoring Microsoft‚Äôs strategy. Laptop Dilemma: Surface Book or MacBook Pro? So what will it be upgraders‚Ä¶ MacBook Pro or Surface Book? (Microsoft itself has a side-by-side comparison) Key pros for the¬†Surface Book the way I see it: Surface pen and digital ink (handy for creative work) Clipboard mode (can remove screen and use as a tablet; convenient for inking) Array of ports (Apple seems content to just give us USB-C and fiddly adapters) And favoring¬†MacBook¬†: Best-in-class touchpad (this is critical) Strong, clean, bass-y speakers (I‚Äôm always using my MacBook to review Stark Insider video edits) Superb keyboard with variable backlighting (just something about those Mac keyboards that feels oh-so right‚Ä¶) As for the operating systems, I think it‚Äôs a wash, though I have a slight preference for the Windows 10 file system. It just seems easier, faster to navigate than the MacOS finder. A few years ago, or maybe even just last year, I‚Äôd never expect this to be a reasonable comparison. It would be Mac all the way. Hands down. I‚Äôve scoured the market, and to this day seemingly no one comes close: HP, Dell (getting there though!), Asus, Lenovo (good keyboards), Acer, among others. No one can put together a laptop package the way Apple can. That is until the Surface Book. Sure, I‚Äôve read about early bugs and kinks. But is seems as though Microsoft has addressed the majority of those. And, let‚Äôs not forget‚Ä¶ Headphone jack! Surface Book has one ‚Äî albeit, awkwardly placed alongside the display, resulting in¬†dangling, tangling cable-itis. Still, it‚Äôs thankfully there. And the new MacBooks? My suspicion is Apple will pull an iPhone 7, and get rid of it, forcing us to go the Bluetooth or USB-C route. Hassle, that. Call me old school, but whether at the gym or at Starbucks, I like good old fashioned Beats in-ear headphones with that classic, fool proof, battery-free 3.5mm jack. I also like 80‚Äôs new wave. So maybe I‚Äôm slow to change. I likely can‚Äôt wait until 2017 for the Surface Book 2. Instead, I‚Äôll check out what Apple unleashes tomorrow, and then make a decision by end of the year. As an aside: is it just me, or is Apple starting to lose the innovation race? Surface Book vs. MacBook? Currently, I‚Äôm leaning ‚Äî if ever so slightly ‚Äî to¬†Satya Nadella‚Äôs corner.

Apple designed the Safari Technology Preview to test features that may be introduced into future release versions of Safari. Safari Technology Preview release 16 includes bug fixes and updates for URL parser, Gamepad API, CSS, Media, Fetch API, JavaScript, Web APIs, Web Inspector, and Accessibility. As of release 14, Safari Technology Preview includes regular updates and bug fixes for Safari's WebDriver implementation. The Safari Technology Preview update is available through the Software Update mechanism in the Mac App Store to anyone who has downloaded the browser. Versions are available for developers running both macOS Sierra and OS X El Capitan. Full release notes for the update are available on the Safari Technology Preview website. Apple's goal with Safari Technology Preview is to gather feedback from developers and users on its browser development process. Safari Technology Preview can be run side-by-side with the existing Safari browser and while designed for developers, it does not require a developer account to download. Tag: Safari Technology Preview 8 comments Top Rated Comments (View all) Andres Cantu 3 weeks ago Still waiting for Safari to make a comeback, it's currently the lowest-scoring browser in the HTML5 test. Rating: 3 Votes Kognito 3 weeks ago Still waiting for Safari to make a comeback, it's currently the lowest-scoring browser in the HTML5 test. This update takes it from 415 points to 429 points on the HTML5 test so they're clearly heading in the right direction, but I agree, Apple needs to make a big push to bring Safari up to spec and to push updates more frequently. There's a stink amongst web development circles, no it isn't body odour, nor is it IE any more, sadly the browser they're all complaining about is Safari. Article would have done well to mention that El Capitan will no longer get updates for Safari Tech Preview. Upgrading to El Cap pretty much broke all my development tools with SIP so I'm reluctant to jump on the Sierra bandwagon but this might just force my hand.

U.S. stocks continue to slide early Wednesday, Oct. 26, 2016. Technology companies are taking some of the biggest losses as investors weren‚Äôt impressed with Apple‚Äôs latest results. Energy companies are falling with the price of oil. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig, File) Single page Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (1) New York ‚Ä¢ U.S. stocks are slightly lower Wednesday afternoon as real estate companies skid. Apple is sliding after its latest results failed to impress investors, pulling technology stocks down with it. However banks and industrial companies are trading higher. KEEPING SCORE: The Dow Jones industrial average added 35 points, or 0.2 percent, to 18,203 as of 11:25 a.m. Mountain time. The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 3 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,139. The Nasdaq composite slipped 26 points, or 0.5 percent, to 5,257. APPLE CORED: Apple sank $3.08, or 2.6 percent, to $115.18. The company's iPhone sales fell 5 percent from a year ago. Apple gets about two-thirds of its revenue from iPhone sales and some investors are concerned it depends too much on its marquee product. VIDEOS TOP JOBS Apple said it expects sales to start growing again in the holiday season after a recent slump. Investors had thought the same: Apple stock has climbed over the last few months to reach new highs for the year. BANKS: Financial firms continued to report strong third-quarter results, as they've been doing for more than a week. Regional bank Huntington Bancshares gained 57 cents, or 5.6 percent, to $10.76 and insurer Chubb rose $3.70, or 3 percent, to $126.15. Banks also got a boost from higher bond yields, which are linked to higher interest rates and bigger profits on loans. Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 1.79 percent from 1.76 percent. MALLS MAULED: Real estate investment trusts took big losses. Simon Property Group, which owns shopping mall and other real estate and is the largest publicly traded company in the industry, reported strong earnings. But analysts were worried about its performance, including lower income from stores that have been open for more than a year. Its stock fell $6.66, or 3.4 percent, to $190.61. Office space company Boston Properties lost $3.06, or 2.4 percent, to $122.27 as investors were disappointed by its forecasts. INDUSTRIAL STRENGTH: Manufacturers made some of the largest gains Wednesday. Boeing climbed $5.97, or 4.3 percent, to $145 after it raised its forecast for earnings, revenue, and plane deliveries. Defense contractor Northrop Grumman also boosted its annual forecasts, and its stock gained $7.46, or 3.4 percent, to $226.99. Manufacturer Ingersoll-Rand picked up $2.08, or 3.2 percent, to $66.68 following its report. FIND THE PULSE: Medical device maker Edwards Lifesciences reported disappointing sales of heart devices and forecast another shortfall in the current quarter. Its stock slid $15.44, or 13.6 percent, to $98.24. SNACK ATTACK: Mondelez, the maker of Oreo cookies, Cadbury chocolate and Trident gum, climbed after reporting a bigger profit than analysts expected. The company's stock picked up $1.45, or 3.4 percent, to $44.21. OIL PRICES: Oil prices wavered and energy companies turned lower. Benchmark U.S. oil fell 83 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $49.13 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the international standard, dropped 93 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $49.86 a barrel in London. CHIPOTLE GETS GRILLED: Mexican food chain Chipotle continued to struggle in its efforts to win back customers after food safety scares that started last year. Its sales fell for the fourth quarter in a row and were worse than analysts expected. The stock lost $34.75, or 8.6 percent, to $370.92. TECH GAINERS: Akamai Technologies rose $8.78, or 14.9 percent, $67.85 on a bigger profit and better sales for the cloud services company. Juniper Networks, a computer network equipment maker, gained $2.69, or 11.3 percent, to $26.41 after investors were pleased with its projections. FASTEN YOUR SEATBELTS: Southwest Airlines gave a weak revenue forecast for the rest of the year. Ticket prices have been falling for two years and Southwest said prices are still "soft" while its spending grew. The stock lost $2.98, or 7.1 percent, to $38.97. American Airlines and United also traded lower. MYLAN MISERY: Drugmaker Mylan fell after investors learned that an allergy injection that competes with Mylan's EpiPen shot will go back on sale in 2017. Kaleo Pharmaceuticals' Auvi-Q was taken off the market last year because of the potential for inaccurate dosing, and EpiPen hasn't had direct competition since then. ¬ª Next page...

What I think is most interesting about this event is that you finally get a sense that software and hardware at Microsoft are working together, like hardware and software work at Apple. Microsoft‚Äôs historic advantage has been its ability to use companies like Dell, HP and Lenovo as partners to control and dominate the PC market. But its disadvantage has been that the software/hardware experience has been disjointed and not as seamless as it has been with Apple. Surface, Microsoft‚Äôs own hardware platform, did create conflicts with partners that weren‚Äôt appreciated but it also created the promise that eventually the two parts of the solution would shift from embarrassing discord to a solution in harmony. At this event, my core takeaway is that this is finally happening and, I think, this will eventually help all Windows hardware. In addition, with this edition of Windows, Microsoft is again focused on the people who use Windows. This focus was core to the success of Windows 95 but somehow got lost, a loss that was particularly noticeable with Windows ME, Windows Vista and Windows 8. Users drive software updates and this coming update is focused on pushing the boundaries of 3D, much like Windows 95 pushed the boundaries of productivity. Let me walk you through the launch. Creation in 3D We saw a problem with the emergence and failure of 3D TVs. There just wasn‚Äôt any compelling content and the tools to create it were difficult to learn, lacked standards and were extremely expensive. As we move from flat panels into things like artificial reality (AR), virtual reality (VR) and mixed reality (MR), we increasingly need to work with 3D objects. If users don‚Äôt have tools that are easy to use, where they can easily share the result and where people are inspired, these new platforms will fail as well. This is what is motivating Microsoft to pivot Windows and, much like Office addressed a need for comprehensive productivity tools, this latest version of Windows is designed to help users create the objects they‚Äôll need to enable the coming world of 3D immersive objects, ranging from those that only exist virtually to those that can be 3D printed into the real world. Microsoft‚Äôs surveys indicate that Generation Z wants this capability badly, and if it can address this need, it will fuel a resurgence in the PC space. This version of Windows, therefore, isn‚Äôt for the current generation of users but the coming generation and, to be fair, those in the current generation who haven‚Äôt aged out of wonder. The app that Microsoft has focused on is Microsoft Paint. This product, a free feature in Windows, is now 3D-enabled, giving it additional functionality while not significantly increasing the skills needed to use it. Coupled with a new service, Remix 3D, a social network where people share 3D content, and SketchUp (a Microsoft partner), users can build 3D images using a blend of their own content from third parties. The demonstration was surprisingly compelling. The presenter took a blend of elements and, in a few minutes, was able to publish an animated GIF and post it on Facebook where it rotated in 3D when done. Much of this same capability is available in PowerPoint, where you can insert 3D objects and position them in three dimensions. For instance, you can take a 3D image of a tree and rotate it in all three dimensions to not only create the perfect angle but animate the result. So, for instance, an image of a car could be rotating in full 3D while you‚Äôre talking about it. If you then had access to HoloLens, or a mixed-media headset, you could interact with these created objects in the real world. That image of a car could be seen in your own garage, or an image of a bar stool could be placed virtually in your home, or with VR glasses, into a virtual world. HoloTour and Cheaper VR Glasses This was an interesting demonstration. This feature, created initially for HoloLens, also works with VR glasses, and allows people to go to distant places virtually and experience them as if they are there. HP, Dell, Lenovo, Asus and Acer will be shipping VR glasses starting in the $200 range so that people can enjoy VR more affordably. Right now, VR with the PC is pretty pricey, costing for an HTC Vive or Oculus Rift around $1K and, I can tell you from experience that they are a pain to set up. Xbox You folks may not care about gaming, but your CMO may. The ratings on traditional sports TV shows have been dropping sharply while the number of viewers watching video games online has been growing. For many of the larger tournaments, video games pull larger audiences than the NFL does. Windows 10 and the Xbox make it far easier for players to broadcast individual play and create tournaments. Sadly, this all likely means your kids are going to want both an Xbox S and a new 4K HDR TV for Christmas. Fortunately, both are cheaper this year. People at the Center of Windows An interesting update with this version of Windows is that the top people you communicate with are in the task bar at the bottom of the screen. If you want to communicate or share with them, you either click on them or drag what you want to share onto their image, making the sharing process vastly simpler and easier. I expect the security folks will want to take a look at this because the likelihood that an employee will share something that is confidential will be higher. However, if you regularly share with co-workers or your boss, this will also make that process far faster and easier. This feature aggregates your communications apps so you can more quickly see when they communicate with you and you can more rapidly respond in the app of your choice. Wrapping Up: Lessons for Vendors There is a lesson here (actually several) for vendors, regardless of product. There is much more excitement in the room for this version than is typical at a Windows offering. This is because Microsoft is again focusing on the users, and users drive products. Microsoft has found a couple of areas where products are lacking -- 3D creation and communication -- and pushed the envelope. Suddenly, Windows has gone from being out of date to being relevant again, at least in this room, and if a firm is going to survive and flourish, it has to keep its product current and relevant. Microsoft forgot that for a while. It‚Äôs nice to see that it has remembered it again. I‚Äôll cover the hardware in my next post.

Nikkei says the company will release the intermediary size to accompany the 4.7-inch iPhone 8 and the 5.5-inch iPhone 8 Plus. The move would represent a mild surprise given a 4.0-inch iPhone 8 - a la the iPhone SE - would likely be preferred by Apple‚Äôs traditional customer base. Related: iPhone 8 - Everything you need to know Elsewhere, the Nikkei report claimed Apple is still ‚Äútentative‚Äù over whether the iPhone 8 will boast the heavily-rumoured glass back. That design was last seen on the iPhone 4S. However, Apple could still maintain the current metal-backed design, according to the sources. The ‚Äòperson familiar with the matter‚Äô pointed out a recent instance of flip-flopping when Apple decided to drop the release of a single-lens iPhone 7 Plus months before it was due. Should Apple opt for the glass front and back, it is believed the components will be supplied by the companies Biel and Lens. The iPhone 8 is likely to be the first major iPhone redesign since 2014, with the iPhone 6S and 7 sticking to the formula debuted by the iPhone 6. Video: Buy an iPhone 7 or wait for iPhone 8?

Apple is sliding after its latest results failed to impress investors, pulling technology stocks down with it. However, banks and industrial companies are trading higher. KEEPING SCORE: The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 35 points, or 0.2 percent, to 18,203 as of 1:25 p.m. Eastern time. The Standard & Poor‚Äôs 500 index lost 3 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,139. The Nasdaq composite slipped 26 points, or 0.5 percent, to 5,257. APPLE CORED: Apple sank $3.08, or 2.6 percent, to $115.18. The company‚Äôs iPhone sales fell 5 percent from a year ago. Apple gets about two-thirds of its revenue from iPhone sales and some investors are concerned it depends too much on its marquee product. Apple said it expects sales to start growing again in the holiday season after a recent slump. Investors had thought the same: Apple stock has climbed over the last few months to reach new highs for the year. BANKS: Financial firms continued to report strong third-quarter results, as they‚Äôve been doing for more than a week. Regional bank Huntington Bancshares gained 57 cents, or 5.6 percent, to $10.76 and insurer Chubb rose $3.70, or 3 percent, to $126.15. Banks also got a boost from higher bond yields, which are linked to higher interest rates and bigger profits on loans. Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 1.79 percent from 1.76 percent. MALLS MAULED: Real estate investment trusts took big losses. Simon Property Group, which owns shopping mall and other real estate and is the largest publicly traded company in the industry, reported strong earnings. But analysts were worried about its performance, including lower income from stores that have been open for more than a year. Its stock fell $6.66, or 3.4 percent, to $190.61. Office space company Boston Properties lost $3.06, or 2.4 percent, to $122.27 as investors were disappointed by its forecasts. INDUSTRIAL STRENGTH: Manufacturers made some of the largest gains Wednesday. Boeing climbed $5.97, or 4.3 percent, to $145 after it raised its forecast for earnings, revenue, and plane deliveries. Defense contractor Northrop Grumman also boosted its annual forecasts, and its stock gained $7.46, or 3.4 percent, to $226.99. Manufacturer Ingersoll-Rand picked up $2.08, or 3.2 percent, to $66.68 following its report. FIND THE PULSE: Medical device maker Edwards Lifesciences reported disappointing sales of heart devices and forecast another shortfall in the current quarter. Its stock slid $15.44, or 13.6 percent, to $98.24. SNACK ATTACK: Mondelez, the maker of Oreo cookies, Cadbury chocolate and Trident gum, climbed after reporting a bigger profit than analysts expected. The company‚Äôs stock picked up $1.45, or 3.4 percent, to $44.21. OIL PRICES: Oil prices wavered and energy companies turned lower. Benchmark U.S. oil fell 83 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $49.13 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the international standard, dropped 93 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $49.86 a barrel in London. CHIPOTLE GETS GRILLED: Mexican food chain Chipotle continued to struggle in its efforts to win back customers after food safety scares that started last year. Its sales fell for the fourth quarter in a row and were worse than analysts expected. The stock lost $34.75, or 8.6 percent, to $370.92. TECH GAINERS: Akamai Technologies rose $8.78, or 14.9 percent, to $67.85 on a bigger profit and better sales for the cloud services company. Juniper Networks, a computer network equipment maker, gained $2.69, or 11.3 percent, to $26.41 after investors were pleased with its projections. FASTEN YOUR SEATBELTS: Southwest Airlines gave a weak revenue forecast for the rest of the year. Ticket prices have been falling for two years and Southwest said prices are still ‚Äúsoft‚Äù while its spending grew. The stock lost $2.98, or 7.1 percent, to $38.97. American Airlines and United also traded lower. MYLAN MISERY: Drugmaker Mylan fell after investors learned that an allergy injection that competes with Mylan‚Äôs EpiPen shot will go back on sale in 2017. Kaleo Pharmaceuticals‚Äô Auvi-Q was taken off the market last year because of the potential for inaccurate dosing, and EpiPen hasn‚Äôt had direct competition since then. Over the last few months Mylan has come under fire for repeatedly raising the price of EpiPen. Its price has roughly doubled since 2007. Mylan stock lost 91 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $37.77 and it‚Äôs down 22 percent since mid-August. CURRENCIES: The dollar inched up to 104.57 yen from 104.22 yen. The euro rose to $1.0911 from $1.0892. OVERSEAS: The FTSE 100 of Britain dropped 0.9 percent while Germany‚Äôs DAX and the CAC 40 in France were little changed. Japan‚Äôs Nikkei 225 edged 0.2 percent higher, but Hong Kong‚Äôs Hang Seng dropped 1 percent and South Korea‚Äôs Kospi lost 1.1 percent.

Posted 26 Oct 2016 19:30 Updated 27 Oct 2016 04:30 Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S., October 25, 2016. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid Enlarge Caption¬† Email More A A REUTERS: Quarterly results were the main driver for Wall Street on Wednesday as a decline in Apple shares weighed on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, while the price-weighted Dow Industrials was buoyed by gains in Boeing. Apple, the world's largest exchange-traded company, fell 2.2 percent after it acknowledged that strong demand for its iPhone 7 Plus caught the company off-guard and it was struggling to keep up. On the other hand, Boeing shares hit their highest level since Dec. 31 after the planemaker reported a jump in quarterly profit despite slower sales. Boeing closed up 4.7 percent at US$145.54. S&P 500 earnings have so far surprised on the upside, with the blended growth estimate at 2.2 percent, from a 0.5 percent decline expected at the start of this month. Of the companies that have reported, 74 percent have beaten analyst expectations - above the 70 percent beat rate over the past four quarters, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. "There's an expectation that when we finish the season that the earnings recession will be abated and that should be positive for the market going forward," said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial in Newark, New Jersey. She said, however, that a number of earnings misses left the market in a tight range and in search of a stronger catalyst. "The market looks tired," Krosby said. "Breadth has been narrowing and that has a number of (technical analysts)telegraphing caution." The number of weekly 52-week highs on the New York Stock Exchange has diminished sharply from the year's peak in late June, at more than 1,500, to less than 400 last week and just 262 so far this week. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 30.06 points, or 0.17 percent, to 18,199.33, the S&P 500 lost 3.73 points, or 0.17 percent, to 2,139.43 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 33.13 points, or 0.63 percent, to 5,250.27. About 6.6 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, above the 6.4 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions. Chipotle Mexican Grill shares slumped 9.3 percent after the restaurant chain operator reported a bigger-than-expected drop in quarterly sales at established restaurants. Edwards Lifesciences was the biggest loser on the S&P 500, falling 17.1 percent after the medical device maker's third-quarter sales missed expectations. On the positive column, Mondelez added 3.6 percent to US$44.32 after its quarterly profit beat estimates and it raised its profit forecast for the year. Earlier, economic data showed new home sales unexpectedly rose and both wholesale and retail inventories increased in September, while the goods trade deficit narrowed sharply, suggesting a stronger pickup in economic growth in the third quarter than is currently anticipated. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.83-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.21-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 9 new 52-week highs and 5 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 55 new highs and 77 new lows.

Vanity Fair hive business technology politics vf summit hwd movies television awards reviews vanities celebrity fashion beauty royals NEWSLETTER Video VF Store Search Business Politics Technology VF Summit Apple The Surprising Victim of Samsung‚Äôs Smartphone Nightmare Email Facebook Twitter SIGN UP FOR NEWSLETTER Apple The Surprising Victim of Samsung‚Äôs Smartphone Nightmare Apple‚Äôs inability to capitalize on the scandal has marked the latest in a series of bad breaks. by Maya KosoffOctober 26, 2016 2:01 pm Email Facebook Twitter By Marlene Awaad/Bloomberg/Getty Images. Samsung‚Äôs exploding phone scandal has been a public-relations nightmare. This fall, the South Korean company was forced to issue a recall of its flagship smartphone after a series of incidents in which the device caught fire, urging millions of customers to return their Galaxy Note 7s in exchange for a replacement. Then, when even some of those replacement phones began catching fire, Samsung announced that it was killing off production of the phone line entirely and said it was asking its global partners to stop selling the device. Samsung shares dropped about 9 percent on the news. Apple couldn‚Äôt have asked for a luckier break. Sales of the company‚Äôs own flagship smartphone had been slowing, and the new iPhone 7, released in early September, received mixed reviews. ‚ÄúThe timing couldn‚Äôt be worse from Samsung‚Äôs perspective‚Äîtheir big flagship was launched just weeks before the iPhone 7 was announced, and was supposed to be on sale for a couple of weeks before the iPhone 7, but in the end you can‚Äôt buy a Note 7 anywhere,‚Äù analyst Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research, told Fox News at the time. ‚ÄúApple will definitely benefit at least some from a combination of Note 7 buyers whose phones were recalled and would-be Note7 buyers who will now buy an iPhone instead. It‚Äôs not going to make an enormous difference, but it‚Äôll certainly help a little.‚Äù But two weeks after Apple‚Äôs biggest competition temporarily surrendered the war for smartphone dominance, the world‚Äôs most valuable company is struggling to capitalize because it doesn‚Äôt actually have enough iPhones to meet demand. ‚ÄúParticularly on iPhone 7 Plus, we are significantly supply constrained,‚Äù Luca Maestri, Apple‚Äôs finance chief, admitted during Apple‚Äôs fourth-quarter earnings report on Tuesday. ‚ÄúThe demand [for Jet Black iPhones] has been significantly stronger than our original expectations ‚Ä¶ We are selling everything that we can produce.‚Äù If you try ordering an iPhone right now on Apple‚Äôs Web site, you‚Äôll be told you have to wait up to eight weeks for it to arrive. It‚Äôs an incredible missed opportunity for Apple. Last quarter, its revenue dropped for the first time in 15 years. After years of record profits, Western markets seem to have reached a saturation point for the iPhone, while sales in emerging markets like China are slowing significantly. Now, despite Samsung‚Äôs weakness, Apple is projecting underwhelming holiday sales, causing the stock to slump. ‚ÄúThere was expectation for better guidance in the context that Samsung isn‚Äôt doing so well and these guys should be winning market share,‚Äù Abhey Lamba, an analyst at Mizuho Securities, told Bloomberg. Meanwhile, Apple‚Äôs efforts to build a new flagship product to supplement the iPhone‚Äîwhich provides the company with two-thirds of its revenue‚Äîaren‚Äôt going so well. Project Titan, the company‚Äôs top-secret driverless-car initiative, has laid off employees ahead of a looming 2017 deadline for the project to prove its feasibility. Apple Watch sales are also down 71 percent. C.E.O. Tim Cook gave a defensive answer on Tuesday when asked about Apple‚Äôs strategy for the coming years. ‚ÄúWe have the strongest pipeline that we‚Äôve ever had and we‚Äôre really confident about the things in it,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut as usual we‚Äôre not going to talk about what‚Äôs in it.‚Äù Share Email Facebook Twitter Maya KosoffMaya Kosoff writes about tech for VF.com, with a focus on start-ups and venture capital.

A new report out of Japan claims that the iPhone 8 is going to be offered in three different sizes and that all models will feature glass backs. The report mentions that Apple‚Äôs position on glass backs is ‚Äútentative‚Äù right now which means that it might go back to using metal casings like it does on existing handsets if the glass backs don‚Äôt make sense. According to the report, the iPhone 8 will be available in 4.7, 5, and 5.5 inch sizes and all of them might feature glass backs. Previous rumors have also suggested that Apple might go for glass on both sides of the device next year. A metal frame will be sandwiched between the glass panels. The two smaller models of the iPhone 8 are reportedly going to stick with the LTPS display technology used in existing iPhones whereas the 5.5 inch model is said to feature a curved OLED display must like the one you get with the Galaxy S7 edge. Rumors suggest that it‚Äôs actually going to source those displays from Samsung. It‚Äôs still too soon to be sure of what the next-generation iPhone is going to bring to the table as we‚Äôre almost a full year away from when it‚Äôs due. Apple has obviously said nothing about the iPhone 8 as yet to it‚Äôs best to take these rumors and reports with a grain of salt for now until there‚Äôs more conclusive evidence to support these theories.

Dealing with rumours swirling after the AT&T-TW deal, Cook said that Apple is ‚Äúopen to acquisitions of any size that are of strategic value where we can deliver better products to our customers and innovate more‚Äù. Apple sees a ‚Äúgreat opportunity‚Äù for the company to create and own content, he added. In the results for the three months ending September 24th 2016 Apple doesn‚Äôt break out Apple TV sales as it does for other units but the catch-all ‚Äòother‚Äô division that contains its STB ‚Äì along with the Apple Watch and Beats headphones ‚Äì had a 22 per cent decline in revenue to $2.37 billion. The group posted quarterly revenue of $46.9 billion and quarterly net income of $9 billion, compared to revenue of $51.5 billion and net income of $11.1 billion in the year-ago quarter. Earlier this year it was rumoured Apple was to bid for Time Warner and it is now touted as a suitor for Netflix.

News Analysis 2 0 0 October 26, 2016 Apple Earnings 2016: Company Sees First Decline In Profits Since 2001 ‚Äî Are iPhone 7 Explosions To Blame? David Cornell Apple‚Äôs earnings in 2016 may still be profitable for the company that Steve Jobs built, but they are dropping for the first time in over a decade. It may be due to the high price of Apple products opposed to the generally higher quality that keeps consumers coming back year after year. That high price may be part of what appears to be a break in the 15-year trend. When your company is known for its quality, anything can destroy your image if it‚Äôs a big enough issue. A fast-food chain known for its delicious burgers could lose business to another chain if their customer service is lacking or they cheat customers out of money because they accidentally swapped a chicken sandwich with a cheeseburger. Recent news of the iPhone 7 exploding, according to iTech Post, may have created waves of disappointment, as consumers could be abandoning their product loyalty and going with Android instead. Samsung appears to be the culprit for the similar trend with the Android Galaxy Note 7, but Apple is known for depending on them to supply parts for their smartphones. Apple‚Äôs 15-year streak is officially over. The company just posted its first annual sales decline since 2001 https://t.co/T2aCAHTrXQ pic.twitter.com/DMiLApk5NZ ‚Äî CNN (@CNN) October 26, 2016 Another possibility is the lack of a headphone jack. This makes all 3.5mm-based headphones and earbuds useless and forces the use of Bluetooth, which is notorious for making phone calls difficult due to bad connections or excess background noise. It‚Äôs usually obvious when the other person is talking on Bluetooth, because if they don‚Äôt speak up, you often can‚Äôt understand them. 2001 was the first time Apple saw an earnings boost due to the introduction of the iPod, a handy device that ended up revolutionizing the way we play music. The smallest of these, the Shuffle, was the only one without a screen, but it delivered the same music quality as those shoulder-riding stereos we had in the 80s. The drop in size came at a price, though, and the iPod Shuffle is still around $40 and up for something you could literally clip to your shirt. Apple‚Äôs earnings in 2016 declined to $1.67 per share, according to CNBC, down from $1.96 per share in 2015. This marks the first time in 15 years that Apple‚Äôs profits have dropped. Some might say that part of the reason would be the untimely death of founder Steve Jobs, who was known to be a visionary genius. The company has since been run by Tim Cook, who took a different approach. Apple¬í‚Äôs annual sales fall for the first time since 2001 https://t.co/eOfK4bv1An pic.twitter.com/kzAkUkCKh0 ‚Äî CNN Breaking News (@cnnbrk) October 25, 2016 One approach may include abandoning Samsung as a supplier if the manufacturer can‚Äôt halt the explosions being reported with a re-design. The iPhone 7 and Galaxy Note 7 appear to be following a disturbing trend most notably seen with hoverboards last year. The rolling conveyance toys had been known for using high-heat batteries and a lack of ventilation, which often caused them to catch fire. This happened while riding or even just charging. Amazon and other online retailers had offered a full refund to anyone who purchased the toys. Under Tim Cook, Apple is said to be more environmentally conscious, pushing their products to be greener, according to CNN. However, the emergence of the possibility of the iPhone 7 exploding could lead to increased pollution, ever so slightly, if not fixed. Senior vice president at Synchronoss Technologies Dan Ives has stated, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to be interesting: The next 6 to 12 months are pivotal for the industry. It speaks what type of pent up demand there is. Does Google become a player? Will Samsung get back on track? I think it‚Äôs almost like a game of high stakes poker. You want to see where everyone‚Äôs cards stand.‚Äù Can Apple‚Äôs earnings in 2016 recover after news of iPhone 7 explosions?

(NASDAQ: AAPL) delivering $0.02 a share higher than the estimates, Global Equities Research's Trip Chowdhry believes Apple is a secular growth story. The analyst thinks the biggest and the longest upgrade cycle for iPhone has just commenced. While stating that the tech bellwether validated nearly every data point of the Global Equities Research's earlier report, the brokerage expects market share gain for iPhone, which has a 12 percent market share in the smartphone segment. The firm thinks that the company could gain from new geographies like India, Malaysia, Nigeria, Thailand and Vietnam. Trip Chowdhry cited the following factors as support for his thesis: Focus on senior citizens. Adoption has just commenced for enterprises. Strongest ecosystem for developer. Its own SDK for every initiative. Strongest app economy enabling an app for all. The brokerage noted the first quarter revenue outlook of $76 billion‚Äì$78 billion exceeds the consensus's outlook of $75.3 billion. Following the in-line expectations, Trip Chowdhry maintains an Overweight rating and a target price of $155 on the stock. This implies over a 30 percent upside potential from the current levels. At last check, Apple was down 2.77 percent at $114.97.

Ogg October 26, 2016 12:05 pm EST Print Email Tweet Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) remains the most valuable company in the world by market cap. It is also one of the top companies followed by the public and by the analyst community. With Apple shares down in reaction to beating some earnings expectations, 24/7 Wall St. wanted to take a closer look at the world‚Äôs most widely followed company. Apple managed to sell more iPhones than analysts had called for. Revenue guidance was also higher. After it sold 45.51 million iPhones, Reuters had projected a 44.8 million unit consensus. What stands out here is that this actually marked the third straight quarter of falling iPhone sales, versus 48.05 million units this quarter last year. Revenue of $46.85 billion also marked the third consecutive decline ‚Äî and this was the first annual drop in revenue dating back all the way to 2001. Tim Cook‚Äôs guidance for the holiday quarter already has been pondered as perhaps being conservative by some analysts. Cook‚Äôs forecast of $76 billion to $78 billion in holiday quarter revenues compares with¬†about $75.1 billion expected from Thomson Reuters. One thing that may be an issue is that Apple already claims to be selling out everything it releases in China. That will make it harder for Cook and Apple to capitalize handily off of Samsung‚Äôs huge phone recall debacle. Intense competition is persistent in this space, even from Chinese rivals. 24/7 Wall St. has so far tracked 13 analyst changes. By the weekend, there may have been two to three times that many calls. Stifel was one of the key downgrades. The firm thinks the implied guidance of 75 million to 77 million iPhone units may be questioned by investors as well. Apple‚Äôs weakness in China led to it being downgraded to a Hold from Buy, and the firm cut its price target to $115 from $130. Credit Suisse reiterated Apple‚Äôs Outperform rating and also kept its $150 price target static. That is way above consensus. Near term, iPhone is performing OK and growth is returning. Credit Suisse said: iPhone units came in at 45.5 million (-5.3% year over year), which was an improvement over last quarter‚Äôs decline of 15.0% year over year. We now assume 77.3 million units next quarter, up 3.5% year over year. The company noted that the iPhone 7 and in particular the 7 Plus are both currently supply constrained and may not reach supply and demand equilibrium until the end of the year or later, suggesting underlying demand is strong. FBN Securities reiterated its Outperform rating and raised its $120 target price to a higher $130 target on Apple. The firm noted that profit taking and gross margin concerns create an attractive entry point for long-term investors. Mizuho thinks the iPhone guidance was too conservative due to the recent news flow around rival Samsung. Merrill Lynch has a Buy rating and $125 price objective. The firm issued 10 different reasons to own Apple after earnings. It said: The iPhone average selling prices (ASP) and mix should more than offset marginally lower units that are supply constrained. The iPhone 7+ will remain constrained in the December quarter and channel inventory has room to move higher in March. Longer term ASPs have more room for upside and carrier subsidies (in US) likely to continue at a two year cadence. Morningstar noted that Apple provided solid enhancements for iPhone and the Apple Watch, and it maintained a $133 fair value estimate. The S&P Equity research group reiterated its 12-month target price at $130 as it is more optimistic about the iPhone 7 cycle, and it sees accelerating services growth and Apple winning from higher Android switch rates. Other price target hikes were seen as follows: Barclays to $119 from $114. Independent Research to $140 from $130. JPMorgan to $114 from $107 (under current price). Macquarie to $133 from $132. Piper Jaffray to $155 from $151. Raymond James to $148 from $139. Apple shares were in the red on Wednesday after earnings. After closing at $118.25, Apple shares were down $3.34 at $114.91, for a 2.8% drop. That may be lower, but shares actually hit a low of $113.31 earlier Wednesday morning. It is just important to realize that Apple shares had been on a serious rampage higher from its lows earlier this year. Another consideration is that analysts have ratcheted their price targets higher in general. Thomson Reuters showed that the consensus analyst price target is $130.48 now.

Bloomberg reports that Apple has opened a Canadian office in the Ottawa suburb, Kanata, which is a short distance from BlackBerry-owned QNX. Despite this however, the office is staffed with two dozen engineers who‚Äôve partially been poached from QNX. MobileSyrup previously reported that Apple hired the former head of QNX Dan Dodge most likely to work on its driverless car project, otherwise known as Project Titan. In addition, Apple also poached Derrick Keefe, a former senior engineer at QNX after more than 10 years of employment. While Apple has never officially confirmed the existence of Project Titan, several outlets have reported rumours of a car project since it was allegedly founded in 2014. While Apple has quietly hired automotive and software engineers to work on ‚ÄòProject Titan,‚Äô a specific development location has not been leaked until now. This development is a new one for Apple, as the tech giant normally prefers to keep works in progress close to its Cupertino campus. However, Apple‚Äôs intention to open a location in Ottawa was reported earlier this year. The Ottawa Citizen claimed that the 22,000-square-foot space was located on the third floor of 411 Legget Drive. It was speculated at the time that the choice of location could be linked to the office‚Äôs proximity to QNX, though nothing had been confirmed. Bloomberg reports that Apple specifically targeted QNX engineers because of their ‚Äúexperience developing fundamental components of operating systems and power management.‚Äù QNX was acquired by BlackBerry in 2010, and has since become known as one of the foremost influences in the rapidly developing driverless car market. Despite these reports, Apple has reportedly experienced difficulty bringing Project Titan to fruition. According to previous reports from Bloomberg, Apple recently laid off hundreds of people in its car division. MobileSyrup previously reported that departing members of the team had either been reassigned or let go. The Cupertino, California-based tech giant has also never officially acknowledged the existence of Project Titan. This was supposedly due to Apple‚Äôs decision to restructure the car project to reflect a software-based vision rather than a hardware one. More specifically, Apple apparently decided to focus on building the software required to operate a driverless car, leaving it open to partner with existing automotive companies to develop the body of the car. In addition, it was predicted that Apple no longer plans to develop an electric car to compete with companies like Tesla.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Mail Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple How Microsoft‚Äôs iMac copy compares to the Apple original Chris Mills BGR NewsOctober 26, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share Microsoft just announced the Surface Studio, an all-in-one desktop computer aimed squarely at creative designers and professionals. Stop me if you've heard this one before. Of course, we can't talk about the Studio without mentioning the iMac, Apple's all-in-one that Microsoft is clearly challenging. The two machines are clearly similar, but once you dig down, there's all sorts of differences to examine. DON'T MISS:¬†The 7 biggest announcements from Microsoft‚Äôs October event Screen The biggest selling point on both these devices is the screen. We're going to focus on the 27-inch 5K iMac, since it's the closest competitor to the Studio. Apple's computer has¬†5,120 x 2,880 pixels across 27 inches, which means 217 pixels per inch. Microsoft's screen is 4,500 x 3,000 pixels across 28 inches, so a PPI of 192. It's not a big difference, and you probably won't notice it unless your pixel-peeping real hard. More important is the color accuracy, and we're going to have to wait for real-world comparisons to declare a winner. On the surface, both look pretty similar. Both machines have support for sRGB and DCI-P3 color profiles,¬†promise great color fidelity, and can be switched easily. While neither display is going to replace a $5,000 monitor for movie or photo production work, both are probably just fine for the vast majority of real-world use. Overall, it looks like a tie between both screens in terms of resolution and color accuracy. Of course, there's the matter of the Studio's touch capabilities, but we'll look at that below. en-intl-pdp0-surface-cardinal-42l-00001-f4-desktopMore Design Microsoft made a big deal out of the design choices they've made to make the Studio more flexible. While the iMac has a thin base, relatively thick screen and crams the components in behind, Microsoft chose to made a big base that contains all the guts. This means the screen of the Studio is far thinner -- 12mm throughout -- than the iMac, but has a bigger base. While the iMac's screen is at a fixed height and only tilts, the Studio has a fancy hinge that allows you to convert it into a drawing tablet. Microsoft calls it a "zero-gravity hinge," because it apparently requires zero effort to move. You could accuse the Studio of being a clunkier design because of the boxy base, but the functionality to swivel the screen down to desk height and draw is unbeatable. This round goes to Microsoft. Performance The top-end Studio packs a desktop Core i7, 32GB of RAM, hybrid 2TB SSD/HDD, and discrete GTX 980M inside. Those are top-end PC specs, although the inclusion of a 980M is a little disappointing. That's Nvidia's last-gen mobile graphics card, and it can be handily outclassed by any of Nvidia's new 1000-series graphics cards. Companies are making (admittedly huge) laptops with GTX 1080 cards, so the older graphics card (which, of course, can't be upgraded) is a real let-down for a computer that costs this much, and is meant to be made for serious graphic design professionals. Of course, the iMac isn't much better. The max specs are basically the same, but the best graphics card you can get is AMD's M395X with 4GB of GDDR5. On most benchmarks, the 980M handily outclasses the AMD card. That might all change, because Apple is expected to have an event tomorrow, and a spec bump for the iMac is easily possible. Overall, I'd hand the performance to Microsoft. There's no real difference between the base specs, but the slightly smaller resolution and faster graphics card should make things faster on the Studio. Watch this space, though. en-intl-pdp0-surface-cardinal-42l-00001-c1-desktopMore Input Devices On the iMac, you've got a keyboard and mouse. A¬†fancy¬†keyboard and mouse, to be fair, but still technology that hasn't really changed in 30 years. The Studio comes with as many input devices as I have limbs, however. There's the wireless keyboard and mouse you'd expect. Then, there's the fact that the 28-inch screen is touch-sensitive. Microsoft also includes a pen and a haptic-feedback Dial, so there's no shortage of input devices. Read More The Surface Pen and Dial are probably the biggest reasons to buy the Studio. If the pen experience is anything like the Surface Book, there will be nearly zero latency and a good drawing experience. Microsoft spent the entire event talking about how good the Studio is for creative people, and provided Windows plays nice with all the new input device, this category is a wash for Microsoft. Price But here's the sticking point: the Studio starts at $3,000 for a model with a Core i5, 8GB of RAM, GTX 965M and a 1TB hard drive. The iMac has similar specs for $1,800. The gap between the two could nearly buy you Microsoft's entry-level Surface Book, or a professional-grade Wacom graphics tablet. Things are a tiny bit better at a higher spec. The top-end Studio is $4,200, while the maxed-out iMac is $3,400. That's still a big gap, but the better graphics card goes some way to justify it. But whichever way you cut it, you're paying a big premium with the Studio for better graphics, a fancy hinge and a nice stylus. We'll have to wait and see if it's enough to drag the world's graphic designers to Windows.

Photograph: Reuters Megan Saunders, Microsoft general manager of HoloLens and other emergent technologies announces Paint 3D. Photograph: Reuters Previous Image Next Image ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† Microsoft has expanded its Surface line with a new desktop PC aimed at taking on the iMac. The Surface Studio is a 28-inch PC that has all its components in the base, similar to Apple‚Äôs iMac. However, the Microsoft machine can be changed to a 20-degree angle for more creative uses. Speaking at the launch event, Microsoft product chief Panos Panay said the PC had performance that was unmatched. The tech giant unveiled the $3,000 (‚Ç¨2,750) device during an event in New York that also saw a revamped Surface Book showcased to the crowd, along with the ‚ÄúCreators Update‚Äù for Windows 10 that brings new 3D capabilities to the desktop. The Surface Book i7 comes with a better battery life, about 30 per cent more than its predecessor. Also, according to Microsoft, it has about three times the graphics power of the current MacBook Pro. Apple is expected to launch a revamped line of Macs at an event on Thursday. Free of charge The update would be issued free of charge to current Windows 10 users early next year, Microsoft said. Among the new features added to the operating system is a 3D version of Microsoft‚Äôs Paint drawing programme, with 3D editing features also coming to PowerPoint and other programmes that will allow people to create 3D presentations. Microsoft has also developed a new 3D capture tool for smartphones that will allow users to capture scans of real-world objects and add them to their digital creations. Although the app was demonstrated on a Windows Phone, Microsoft said it was aiming to have the software on all platforms. Also on the way are virtual reality accessories and headsets that will hit the market in 2017. For gamers, Microsoft announced the addition of Beam, a new tool that allows players to stream their games to friends as they play. That will go head to head with Amazon‚Äôs Twitch service. ADVERTISEMENT Terry Myerson, executive vice-president for Microsoft‚Äôs Windows and devices group, said the update was tailored for gamers who were increasingly interested in augmented and virtual reality experiences.

Apple's stock suffered some bruising as the shares sank Wednesday after the tech giant delivered a mixed quarterly report a day earlier. Mostly though, Wall Street analysts maintained their buy and outperform ratings in the wake of news that Apple reported its third straight quarter of year-over-year revenue decline. Here is what analysts are saying after the print: Goldman Sachs Goldman analysts maintained their buy rating on the iPhone seller and wrote, "All in, we viewed the strong guidance as supportive of our near-term thesis that the iPhone 7 will drive upside to consensus." They also noted that acquisitions may play a larger role in Apple's strategy as the company indicated a "more open ended" stance to mergers and acquisitions relative to previous quarters. Goldman noted services were the "star" for the most recent quarter as growth accelerated to 24 percent year over year. Credit Suisse The message from Credit Suisse was clear: "buy any dips." Analysts reiterated their outperform rating on Apple's stock. "While there may be some near-term weakness after the recent strength, we believe the lack of upside to estimates is more reflective of supply constraints," they wrote. "Fundamentally we believe our thesis remains intact with the iPhone 7 driving the business back to growth followed by an iPhone 8 super cycle." Credit Suisse has a $150 price target on Apple stock. RBC Capital Markets RBC maintained its "outperform" rating, writing the recent sell-off creates an "attractive entry point" for investors for a stock that's currently undervalued. Analysts wrote in a note that Apple has multiple levers in place, including emerging markets, enterprise markets and potential new products, such as iTv. Deutsche Bank With a hold rating on the tech giant's stock, Deutsche Bank analysts are "concerned about slowing smartphone growth and elongating refresh cycles in mature markets." Canaccord Genuity The firm maintained its buy rating and $140 price target on Apple stock. "With stronger-than-expected initial iPhone 7 demand greatly outstripping supply, our positive thesis remains intact with continued iPhone market share gains, continued strong growth of high-margin iTunes software and services, new product categories such as Apple Watch and services offerings such as Apple Pay and Apple Music to drive growth with improved margins," analysts wrote.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Hayley Tsukayama October 26 Follow @htsuka Panos Panay, corporate vice president of devices, holds the new Microsoft Surface Studio computer at a live event in Manhattan on Oct. 26. (Lucas Jackson/Reuters) Microsoft is trying to rekindle a rivalry with Apple, introducing two new computers on Wednesday that are aimed squarely at the creative set of customers whom Apple has long claimed as its own. A few years ago, Microsoft seemed to be an afterthought for most in the tech world. Having all but missed the mobile revolution, it was hard¬†to believe chief executive Satya Nadella when he said last year that Microsoft would focus on making innovative products people loved. [Microsoft doesn‚Äôt just want you to use Windows 10. It wants you to love it.] But he meant it. And¬†Microsoft, still looking to shake off its image as the default option for the¬†world's cubicle workers, took to a New York City stage on Wednesday to show off a generation of products designed to promote passion and creativity ‚Äî not just productivity. Microsoft introduced a new desktop, reimagined with touchscreen and pen technology that have earned it a following for its Surface tablets. The 28-inch computer, called the Surface Studio, sits on sleek chrome arms and can adjust to a flat angle for writers and sketchers who want to use it as an enormous piece of paper. Its minimalist design brought to mind the obsessive simplicity of Apple's thinnest Macs. The Surface Studio¬†also comes with a hockey puck-like dial, in addition¬†to a mouse. Users can place the dial on the screen to change things, such as paint color, mid-stroke. It can also be used off-screen, on your desk. ‚ÄúEvery single one of us is a creator,‚Äù said Microsoft's Panos Panay, the company's corporate vice president of devices.¬†‚ÄúWe want people to use this product to help everyone create.‚Äù Here's to the creators. Imagine what you'll do. #MicrosoftEvent pic.twitter.com/Qd8OtZAGg2 ‚Äî Microsoft (@Microsoft) October 26, 2016 Microsoft also introduced a new version of the Surface Book, its high-end laptop, which boasts 16 hours of battery life and, according to Panay, has three times the performance of the highest-end MacBook Pro. That was a not-so-subtle dig that hints at the resurgence of an old rivalry. Microsoft's push into a space that has traditionally been Apple's domain ‚Äî devices for creative types ‚Äî comes at the same time as Apple has been touting the productivity of its own devices. Both are trying to frame their devices as products that can take customers seamlessly from work to play, at a time when the line between the two domains is blurring more than ever. Apple is also expected to introduce new laptops this week, at a Thursday event at its Cupertino, Calif., headquarters. But the MacBook maker has already made clear that it has its eye on the business world that has been Microsoft's domain for many years, particularly with the introduction of its large iPad Pro tablet, which supports a keyboard and is sold as a possible laptop replacement ‚Äî similar to Microsoft's Surface. Of course, it remains to be seen how well either company's attempts to alter their images stick with consumers. And both Microsoft's new products are pricey ‚Äî between $3,000 and $4,200 for the Studio, $2,400 for the Surface book ‚Äî which makes it for high-end buyers. But it seems as if both firms are increasingly marketing to the same group of people. Hardware isn't the only place where Microsoft is trying to change its image. The firm also showed ways it plans to¬†bring 3D-modeling, virtual reality and augmented reality into the mainstream. The company's new ‚ÄúCreators‚Äù version of its Windows 10 operating system, due out in the spring, lets¬†anyone scan and manipulate 3D objects into their computers to place in sketches and PowerPoint presentations. The Windows 10 Creators edition also has more user-centric features such as a ‚Äúpeople bar‚Äù powered by Microsoft's Skype, that will give users easy access to their most-used contacts. Users can also edit emoji, to fit their own personalities. Microsoft also showed off a native program called Beam that lets users stream video games from their PCs.

Energy companies are falling with the price of oil. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig, File) HONG KONG - Global stock markets were steady on Thursday as investors weighed a mixed batch of corporate earnings reports and economic data. KEEPING SCORE: Germany's DAX stock index was flat at 10,710 and France's CAC 40 slipped 0.2 per cent to 4,527. Britain's FTSE 100 was flat at 6,957. U.S. stocks were poised to open slightly higher, with Dow futures ticking 0.2 per cent higher and broader S&P 500 futures gaining 0.3 per cent. PROFIT AND LOSS: Investors were evaluating the latest corporate profit reports. Samsung's profits slumped 17 per cent for the July-September period after it recalled and discontinued its fire-prone Galaxy Note 7 phone. Germany's Deutsche Bank and Volkswagen returned to profits, easing some concerns about their respective problems, including the bank's legal issues in the U.S. and the carmaker's costly emissions scandal. ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: British third quarter growth was better than expected, at a quarterly rate of 0.5 per cent, compared with forecasts for 0.3 per cent. While still a preliminary figure, it helped ease concerns about a potential slowdown following the country's vote in June to leave the European Union. Looking ahead, investors will focus on a U.S. GDP report due Friday, while next week the Federal Reserve and Bank of Japan have policy meetings. ASIA'S DAY: Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index slipped 0.3 per cent to end at 17,336.42 while South Korea's Kospi rose 0.5 per cent to 2,024.12. Hong Kong's Hang Seng lost 0.8 per cent to 23,132.35 and the Shanghai Composite Index in mainland China dipped 0.1 per cent to 3,112.35. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 shed 1.2 per cent to 5,295.50. Benchmarks in Southeast Asia were mostly higher. ENERGY: Oil prices stabilized after falling for three straight days. U.S. benchmark crude futures rose 16 cents to $49.34 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It lost 78 cents overnight. Brent crude, the international standard, added 31 cents to $50.29 a barrel in London. CURRENCIES: The dollar rose to 104.73 yen from 104.66 yen in late trading Thursday. The euro was higher, at $1.0923 from $1.0906. ¬† ¬† ¬† E-mail this Article Print this Article Share this Article ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† Story Tools ¬† E-mail this Article Print this Article Share this Article ¬† Font: * * * * * ¬† Image: * * * * ¬† ¬† ¬† FILE - This Monday, Aug. 24, 2015, file photo shows the New York Stock Exchange.

Time The new Apple iPhone 7 does not include a headphone jack. (Photo: Richard Vogel, AP) The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus have been available for a little more than a month, yet rumors continue to swirl about next year's smartphone. According to Nikkei Asian Review, Apple will launch three iPhone models next year, coinciding with the 10th anniversary of the company's flagship device. All three iPhones¬†‚Äî sporting 4.7-, 5- and 5.5-inch touchscreens, will all feature glass backs, says the report. The tech giant is looking to recharge sales of the iPhone, which were down during Apple's fiscal fourth quarter. Apple also ended the fiscal year with its first decline in revenue since 2001. Shares of Apple slipped 2.7% in afternoon trading. iPhone coverage: Ask Matt: Has Apple and the iPhone peaked? Apple had used glass back on earlier models of the iPhone before switching to an aluminum back with the launch of the iPhone 5 in 2012. Apple reported fourth-quarter iPhone shipments of¬†45.5 million, down 5% from the 48 million shipped a year ago.

Two major reasons have thrown a spanner in its works. The fourth quarter results are out for the world's most successful company and it is not a rosy number. Apple shares have fallen 2 per cent as it posted a third straight quarter of revenue decline (year-on-year). The Cupertino-based company posted (quarterly) revenue of $46.9 billion and net income of $9 billion. These results compare to revenue of $51.5 billion and net income of $11.1 billion, in the same quarter a year ago. Since it released its main jewel, the iconic iphone7, Apple has managed to sell 45 million iphones. During the same period last year, Apple had sold 48 million iPhones - roughly five per cent more. The decline comes even as Apple's main rival - the South Korean major Samsung witnessed a nightmarish few months, recalling its Galaxy Note7 smartphones. While Apple revenues are up in Europe and Japan (compared to 2015), the company didn't do too well in China and the Americas. Two major reasons have thrown a spanner in its works. First - the overall sales of iPhone have been down. For a company that makes almost 65 per cent of its revenues through iPhone, this spells trouble. Secondly growth in China has been sluggish. Sales in the Asian major have fallen by 30 per cent year-on-year. China is Apple's second-largest market with a massive growth potential. Not all is lost though. There is a silver lining on the cloud for Apple. The next six to 12 months are going to be critical. Apple has already set its eyes on 2017 - the anniversary year of iPhone. Investors are expecting a bigger update to the platform than iPhone 7. Already the latest version of iOS - iOS 10 - is being adopted at the faster rate ever. Apple is expecting a return in sales growth during the three months ending December, which would be a good precursor for things to come Share More > Vote MORE FROM Editorials and columns Editorials and columns Despite lacklustre quarter Apple's still got juice While Apple revenues are up in Europe and Japan (compared to 2015), the company didn't do too well in China and the Americas.

October 26 AAPL: 115.59 -2.66 Comment: Microsoft Surface Studio is the company‚Äôs answer to Apple‚Äôs iMac and Mac¬†Pro Greg Barbosa - 3 weeks ago @gregbarbosa iMac Mac Pro Microsoft Microsoft Surface Studio View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit During Microsoft‚Äôs October¬†Windows event today, the company¬†did something I never expected them to do: surpass Apple‚Äôs own desktop solution and experiences. Microsoft announced the launch of their new Surface Studio desktop, an all-in-one system with a beautiful 28‚Äù touchscreen display. A powerhouse of a system with specs up to 32GB of RAM and a¬†GPU with 4 GB video RAM, Microsoft is really pulling out all the stops here to make their desktop solution attractive to all creatives in a way normally seen¬†as Apple‚Äôs place. The iMac has maintained the same design for the past few years, and with the Mac Pro seemingly forgotten within¬†the desktop lineup, Microsoft has a solid chance at stealing¬†some of Apple‚Äôs customers away. A few years ago during Apple‚Äôs September 2010 event, Steve Jobs explained why they hadn‚Äôt built a touchscreen into any of the MacBooks yet. Funnily enough, he stood on stage saying it¬†just a few weeks after patent filings showed Apple was¬†exploring an ‚ÄúiMac Touch‚Äù. The iMac Touch even had a Flex Base that showed the iMac bending at a more comfortable angle for touch input, something we saw today with Microsoft‚Äôs Surface Studio. A similar design, dubbed the Zero Gravity hinge, allows the display to lay nearly flat. The announcement of the Surface Studio showed us something that Apple had hand-waved as not being worth their time: treating a desktop system‚Äôs display as a touchscreen. All the negatives I could think of were answered during Microsoft‚Äôs event. The Surface Studio uses wrist-detection within its display allowing artists to bend the display on the Zero Gravity hinge down into a more comfortable angle and lay on top of it in the same way they would at a drawing desk. The Surface Pen then allows any artist to draw directly on the display like the previous Surface devices could. The argument Jobs showed on stage with the MacBook‚Äôs display being angled strangely as a limiting factor was solved with the Surface Book, and a similar idea is now see in a large screen desktop solution. As the announcements continued today I fully expected that the internal specs would have been lackluster, and that the usage of the touchscreen and Pen integration would be the gimmick that got everyone‚Äôs attention. That was proven wrong once Microsoft began listing out the 192 DPI PixelSense Display, one without discernible pixels from any distance. The hardware integration of the Surface Pen and the Surface Dial (albeit a weird device) shows that Microsoft can still create hardware that integrates intuitively within their new systems. The Surface Studio combines the best of the desktop experience that the iMac provides, an all-in-one solution with a beautiful large display, and the power that a professional would expect from a Mac Pro. This may not be the exact system Apple customers would have expected or wanted from Apple, but one fully welcomed¬†from Microsoft. Both the Mac Pro and Surface Studio start¬†at $2,999, but only Microsoft‚Äôs solution includes everything you need to get started immediately out of the box. There are plenty of arguments as to why Apple might not want to bring a touchscreen system to macOS, but none of those answer why their hero desktop systems have quickly felt as though they are falling behind. Of course with Apple‚Äôs Mac event coming up tomorrow, we can‚Äôt even remotely call this fight over. Apple could surprise us with radical changes in the iMac and Mac Pro, even though we have no expectation of new desktops. Regardless of tomorrow‚Äôs event, Apple needs to show customers soon that they still care about their desktop solutions in a modicum of the same way that Microsoft showed today.

After focusing primarily on the iPhone and Apple Watch at its event in September, Apple¬†is expected to dedicate this one mostly to its aging Mac lineup. This will be Apple's first onstage mention of Mac hardware since March of 2015, when the company unveiled its one-ported Retina MacBook. The only Mac updates to happen since then‚Äîthe 2016 refresh of the MacBook and new 4K and 5K iMacs‚Äîwere introduced more quietly via press releases and early reviews. The MacBook Pro is expected to be the event's biggest announcement, and Apple itself has already leaked significant details about the laptop. It has a customizable OLED touchscreen in place of the row of function keys, and there's a Touch ID fingerprint sensor for authentication and Apple Pay. Aside from the 13- and 15-inch Pros, Apple is expected to announce another laptop in either the MacBook or MacBook Air families, and the company could potentially make announcements about the iMac and its other desktops.

CDT October 26, 2016 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST Stocks cut early losses and were trading mixed Wednesday as investors continue to grapple with the trend of U.S. corporate earnings "beats" being offset by companies that fall¬†short of forecasts continues to keep the broad market in its sideways pattern. In late morning trading, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 50 points, or 0.3%, after being down about 100 points earlier. Dow component profit beats from soft-drink maker Coca-Cola (KO) and aerospace giant Boeing (BA) were competing with disappointing¬†results from iPhone maker Apple (AAPL), which topped earnings estimates by a penny but clocked in its third straight quarter of declining revenue¬†and its first full-year revenue decline in 15 years. Coca-Cola shares were up 0.3% and Boeing's stock surged¬†more than 2%. But Apple was selling off to the tune of almost 3%.¬†The blue chip Dow has closed lower three of the past four trading sessions, leaving it down 2.5% from its Aug. 15 record high and up 4.3% in 2016. The broad Standard & Poor's 500 stock index was flat and the Nasdaq composite index was down 0.2%. The broad market was also dragged down by another drop below $50 per barrel for U.S.-produced crude oil. Stocks were broadly lower in Europe and Asia. The broad Stoxx Europe 600 index was off 0.9%, and shares were lower in Germany, France and Britain. In Asia, despite a 0.2% gain for Japan's Nikkei 225, major stock indexes¬†closed lower in Hong Kong and Shanghai. In other earning news, Wall Street was reacting to by a big profit miss from restaurant chain Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), which is still reeling from its food-safety issue, and cuts to the full-year forecast from music streamer Pandora (P) and hotel chain Wyndham Worldwide (WYN). Chipotle shares were off nearly 7%, Pandora was down more than 7% and Wyndham was down more than 4%. The earnings picture is being closely watched, as third-quarter profit growth has turned positive, which has raised hopes that the so-called profits recession will end at four quarters. Still, some of the profit reports have come in weak and so-called forward guidance from CEOs has been leaning to the negative side.

However, that ignores Apple‚Äôs growing debt load, which stands at $75.4 billion, almost a third of its cash reserves. In fact, in Apple‚Äôs fiscal fourth quarter, the company raised more debt than the cash it added to reserves: Apple‚Äôs cash pile increased by about $6.1 billion, while further bond sales added $6.5 billion to its debt total. Apple‚Äôs cash pile has grown at a fast clip because Apple has funneled the bulk of it into long-term securities while raising debt at relatively low interest rates to finance its massive shareholder return program. That practice is preferred because most of Apple‚Äôs cash‚Äî91% as of the end of its 2016 fiscal year‚Äîis overseas, making it subject to repatriation taxes if the company tries to bring it back to the United States, which Chief Executive Tim Cook has said it will not pay. See also: How Apple could bring overseas cash home to help fix America‚Äôs crumbling infrastructure Apple‚Äôs approach is the most profitable way to deal with the current U.S. tax structure, but the continued rise in its cash reserves‚Äîand the unabashed gawking that total elicits‚Äîis simply a byproduct of that approach. The better way to look at Apple‚Äôs cash reserves is through net cash, or cash minus debt. Read also: Will any presidential candidate give Silicon Valley what it wants most? Apple‚Äôs net cash position at the end of its 2016 fiscal year would be $162.1 billion, up from $121.2 billion at the end of the 2012 fiscal year. That total, and the $41 billion gain over four years, is nothing to sneeze at, but it looks tiny compared with the $116.4 billion gain that a quick look at its cash reserves would indicate. Read also: Apple forecast disappoints, but shares are still a bargain, analysts say Apple is in an enviable position from a cash perspective, to be sure, but its approach to cash and debt makes that cash pile look much larger than it actually is. So next time you see someone comparing Apple‚Äôs cash to the GDP of small countries or other companies‚Äô market caps, respond by comparing its debt load similarly‚Äîafter all, Apple‚Äôs $75.4 billion in debt is more than double the market cap of Tesla Motors Inc.

Comments By Gregg Keizer Follow Computerworld | Oct 26, 2016 10:09 AM PT RELATED TOPICS Apple Mac MacOS Apple Comments Apple on Tuesday said it sold 4.9 million Macs in the September quarter, a 14% year-over-year decline that extended the sales slump to four consecutive quarters. The total was under most estimates made before Apple unloaded its numbers on Wall Street after the close of the market. Last week, research firms IDC and Gartner had pegged global Mac shipments at 5 and 4.95 million, respectively. This week, 28 financial analysts delivered forecasts that ranged from 4.65 million to 5.8 million; their average bet was a too-high 5.1 million. Apple executives had little to say about the Mac's contraction. CFO Luca Maestri contended that the quarter was a "difficult year-over-year compare," referring to the record-setting 5.7 million Macs sold in the same period in 2015, but CEO Tim Cook mentioned the personal computer line only in passing. Maestri also teased the previously-announced event Thursday that Apple will host at its California headquarters. "We'll have some exciting news to share with current and future Mac owners very soon," Maestri said. The September quarter recorded the fourth straight Mac sales decline, equalling the stretch from late 2012 through most of 2013, when the Mac posted year-over-year reductions. Even so, the Mac of 2016 is in a stronger position than the line was in the 2013: Sales over the past four quarters reached 18.5 million. During the earlier slump, Apple sold 16.3 million personal computers. Macs accounted for 11.1% of Apple's total revenue of $47.2 billion, but the computer group remained at No. 3 on the company's list, behind -- by a huge margin -- the iPhone (accounting for 60% of all revenue) and the Services category, which contributed 12.9% of all incoming dollars. The Mac has been subservient to Services for three quarters running. The ASP (average selling price) of the Mac line fell to $1,175, the lowest since Computerworld began recording the number in 2008. The ASP decline signaled that buyers steered toward the less expensive Macs. Wall Street analysts on the conference call with Cook and Maestri took little interest in the Mac, declining to ask any questions about the venerable line. Most analysts and pundits have laid blame for the latest Mac slump -- which has outpaced the decline in the PC industry as a whole, turning what had been an Apple bragging point into something unspoken by executives -- on the aging models, many of which have not been updated for a year or longer. That's true, as far as it goes, said Stephen Baker of the NPD Group. Baker, an analyst who specializes in technology retail sales, agreed that the lack of a Mac refresh has been a drag on sales. "To customers who are coming in at these price points, the Mac looks old and has older features and specs than those in other product lines," Baker said, referring to competitors that sell Windows-based premium PCs. Those rivals, which include Microsoft itself, have learned from Apple. "In the last 6, 9, 12 months, Windows guys have picked up their game considerably," Baker said. But old wasn't the only explanation for the Mac's problems. "It's clearly not the whole reason," said Baker, who then went on to argue that Apple's own shift in emphasis toward the iPad Pro has had an impact. "You can't dismiss the idea that some people are moving from Macs to iPad Pros. It's one of the unrecognized issues in the challenge to sell Macs." Apple will live-stream its Thursday event -- where most expect to see revamped MacBook Pro and MacBook notebooks -- starting at 10 a.m. PT (1 p.m. ET) from its website. Data: Apple Mac sales declined 14% in the September quarter (Q3 16), marking the fourth straight downturn.¬† RELATED TOPICS Apple Mac MacOS Apple Gregg Keizer ‚Äî Senior Writer Senior Writer Gregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld.

That was the main takeaway from Apple's fiscal Q4 earnings call on October 25, where the company also projected a return to year-over-year growth in the December quarter. Apple's Q4 revenue was $46.9 billion, up 11 percent from Q3 and down 9 percent from the year-ago quarter. The company guided Q1 revenue to be in the range of $76 billion to $78 billion, which would return the company to modest year-over-year growth. Sequentially, it would be a jump of 64 percent, reflecting the strong demand for the iPhone 7. Apple revenue trend. Q1 FY17 represents the midpoint of guidance. Apple shipped 45.5 million iPhones in Q4, a 13 percent sequential increase, down 5 percent from the prior year. iPhone average selling price (ASP) increased to $619 from $595 in Q3. Apple expects ASP to increase ‚Äúmarkedly‚Äù in Q1, reflecting iPhone 7 sales. iPhone shipments. Apple reported a record $6.3 billion in revenue from services, reflecting 24 percent year-over-year growth. The company ended the quarter with $238 billion in cash and marketable securities, an increase of $6.1 billion during the quarter. 91 percent of Apple's cash is outside the U.S. Beyond Apple's inability to fully capitalize on the death of Samsung's Note 7, the other negative news was soft demand in China. Revenue in fiscal 2016 was down 17 percent compared with 2015, although Cook noted that 2015 revenue was 84 percent above 2014's. Looking at a two-year horizon, revenue from 2014 to 2016 grew at a 23 percent CAGR, which Cook called ‚Äúa pretty good result.‚Äù The strong demand for the iPhone 7 should be reflected in the quarterly financial results to be reported by the major mobile phone RF front-end manufacturers: Broadcom, Qorvo and Skyworks.

It will manage to make enough of the smaller iPhone 7s, though, he said. Demand was strong ‚Äúparticularly on the iPhone 7 Plus versus our forecast going into the product launch,‚Äù Mr. Cook said. The bigger phones bring bigger profits, and Apple‚Äôs forecast for thinner-than-expected margins concerned investors after it reported quarterly earnings on Tuesday. Apple issued a conservative outlook on margins for the holiday quarter, 38% to 38.5%, versus expectations of nearly 39%, said Mariann Montagne, senior investment analyst and portfolio manager at Gradient Investments. It was not immediately clear if the smartphone shortage caused the miss. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not able to get that product into the hands of the person who wants it right here, right now,‚Äù said IDC analyst John Jackson. ‚ÄúThose are dollars not in your hands.‚Äù The Cupertino, California-based company unveiled its newest iPhones on Sept. 7. The 5.5-inch (14 cm.) Plus model is the first iPhone to have a dual camera on the back that lets users take better portrait shots and zoom in from further away. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs inherently tough to know how things like new finishes and features are going to affect demand for a new model,‚Äù said analyst Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research. Apple is still getting to know how consumer interest varies for larger and smaller phones, having launched two competing sizes only in 2014, he said. The company also may have underestimated the number of customers it would win from Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd., which recently recalled its own large format phone, the Galaxy Note7, after a number of them caught fire. Apple Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri told Reuters in an interview it was ‚Äúimpossible to know‚Äù the effect of Samsung halting production of the Note7 earlier this month. ‚ÄúWe cannot fulfill all the demand that is out there right now,‚Äù he added. Speeding up production would be difficult, analysts said. The company cannot contract new suppliers, hire more workers and open factories overnight, said Trip Chowdhry, managing director of Global Equities Research. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt just shoot iPhones out of an assembly line at the speed of a bullet,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúApple does things to perfection. There is no need to rush and create an inferior product the way Samsung did.‚Äù -- Reuters E-mail | Print | ¬† ¬†¬†From / email : ¬† ¬†¬†To : ¬† ¬†¬†E-mail (required) : ¬† ¬†¬†Message : ¬† ¬† Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. ¬†¬†¬†MORE STORIES Making cities smarter in the Philippines using location-based data on cloud computing GoPro announces recall of 2,500 Karma drones Review: "Sony Xperia XZ Great camera, excellent display" Homegrown social app helps users meet people with similar interests Russia-linked hackers exploit flaw in Windows LG releases new phone Japan rocket with manga art takes off Instagram getting into shopping Opinion: "Shadows behind the Internet" Video review: Vivo Y55 ¬†¬†¬†MOST READ ¬†¬†¬†MOST E-MAILED 1.

The new app will give users personalized TV show recommendations and will suggest TV shows based on their existing viewing habits or content subscriptions. The report says that the app expands the discovery options found on the Apple TV, allowing users to find shows that peak their interests. Specifically, USA Today refers to it as a ‚ÄòWatch List‚Äô but notes that it will more than likely be called something different as it gets unveiled to the public. The new feature may coincide with the Single-Sign On feature that was originally announced for tvOS 10 but has yet to ship. Single-Sign On simplifies the login experience for Apple TV apps by removing the need to type the same TV login credentials for all your apps, instead opting to type it in once and all other apps will be able to use it without asking for the password a second time. Unfortunately, the feature was missing in tvOS 10 and Single-Sign On is currently listed as ‚Äòcoming this fall‚Äô on Apple‚Äôs website.
