Here are some tricks to get the most out of the operating system.  ( Apple ) Advertisement Discovering what lies hidden in the new iPhone 7 or an older device running iOS 10 can be fun if you have a list of top features. Apple launched the iPhone 7 Plus along with its smaller sibling on Sept. 7 and followed up with the release of iOS 10. Older devices like last year's iPhone 6s lineup have also received iOS 10 since then. Among the features discovered on iOS 10 is a magnifying glass that can be enabled and then used to read small print. A list of 10 other simple tricks for iOS 10 is outlined below: Access The Camera From The Lock Screen Smartphone cameras are increasingly complex but the process to use one has been simplified on iOS 10. Swiping to the right when you see the lock screen will bring up the camera app, which can then be used to capture fleeting moments that would otherwise be missed. Get Siri To Locate Photos Getting Siri to locate photos is an easy way to get quick access to old photos. Users just have to open Siri and say, "Show me photos from July 8," which will pull up shots taken on the day. Open Two Webpages Side By Side iOS 10 has also arrived on tablets so users can view two webpages in split view. All they have to do is press and hold a link when using Safari and they will be presented with the "Open in Split" option. Quick Access To Camera With 3D Touch With both the iPhone 6s lineup and the iPhone 7 lineup coming with 3D Touch, Apple has used the technology to provide quick access to camera modes. Users just have to press the Camera app icon on the home screen, which will result in a quick action menu with selfie, slow motion and video options being displayed. Find Parked Cars The Apple Maps app on iOS 10 has also been improved as it can now be used to locate a parked car. This feature works as the iPhone senses when a user is driving a car, and once they stop and park it, the location is marked on Apple Maps and displayed in a notification. Receive Small Size Photos In Messages Users on a limited data plan or who want to save money can choose to get smaller images in iMessage. They can set this up by navigating to Settings, Messages, then choosing the "Low Quality Image Mode." ZDNet says this option is also useful in case of a "poor signal" quality in an area. Search For Photos Using Facial Recognition The Photos app on iOS 10 now comes with facial recognition and upon navigating to Albums then People, users can check those who are identified and more. Siri can also be used to search for photos of a particular person who was photographed in the past. Replace Text With Emojis Using the iMessage app people can change words with emojis. All they have to do is tap the button for emoji within a Message. Once this is done, all the words that can be replaced will be highlighted in orange and they can then be replaced. Get A Reminder To Go To Bed The Clock app can now be used to set a time to head to bed. Once this is enabled by navigating to Clock app then to Bedtime, users will hear an alarm. Add Stickers To Messages Within the iMessage app users can now download sticker packs for games like Super Mario Run or Fallout Shelter and use them when they're sending a text. As users delve into the new features available in iOS 10, more hidden gems are likely to be uncovered in the coming days as the iPhone 7 starts arriving in the hands of users. It remains to be seen, however, if the iPhone 7 lineup will end up being plagued by more instances of explosion in transit.

According to a Reuters report filed late on Friday, the verdict was handed down by a federal jury in Texas that has a reputation for awarding favorable verdicts to plaintiffs in cases involving patent infringement. The U.S. district judge presiding over the case, Robert Schroeder, previously threw out VirnetX's $625.6 million win over Apple from a previous trial because he said jurors in that case may have been confused. The case with Nevada-based patent licensor VirnetX originally began in 2010, with a jury eventually awarding the company $368 million in 2012, but that decision was thrown out in 2014 after the court decided there were problems with how the trial judge had instructed jurors on calculating damages. VirnetX continued to pursue Apple in relation to patents it believes the company infringed upon. The previous two suits were combined by the licensor's lawyers, and in February, a jury returned with an even bigger verdict, $625.6 million – one of the highest ever in a U.S. patent case. However, Schroeder later voided the result, saying that the repeated references to the earlier case could have confused jurors and were unfair to Apple. In the latest trial, reports Reuters, jurors were asked to determine damages on two VirnetX patents that Apple had already been found to infringe, and to determine both infringement and damages on another two patents. The final $302.4 million award was in line with what VirnetX had been demanding. Neither Apple nor VirnetX have commented on the latest case, although Cupertino will surely exhaust all avenues for appeals before accepting the result. In the meantime, it is facing another court proceeding over whether it willfully infinged the patents, which could lead to higher damages. Apple is also set to contend with the trial in a second lawsuit filed by VirnetX over newer versions of Apple security features, as well as its iMessage platform.

Surely people are still authoring blu rays. Used to use DVD Studio Pro but that was ages ago. Is there anything out there for Blur Ray? Even better, blu ray 4k UHD... but that might be too good to be true in late 2016.

FCP X and Compressor are able to export Blu Ray compatible files. Roxio Toast 15 Pro is able to create Blu Ray discs albeit very simple discs. Apple wants discs and PCs to go away. It's a mandate internally. Everything they are driving towards is aimed at iOS either on a phone, tablet, watch and perhaps something along the lines of glasses. If Apple drops Mac Pro and possibly MBP (in it's current form) in the next couple of years, I think this will signify they are essentially done servicing the desktop PC industry. I've listened to many of you say it, I've acknowledged it, and now I'm starting to really see the writing on the wall. Perhaps the iMac will get beefed up a bit and that will hold some people over for a little while, but I think things are changing incredibly fast and Apple is more than happy to see "archaic" computer technology go by the wayside. Who fills this eventual gap, who knows. Perhaps how we work will change. But in the meantime, we need to deal with 8K video and heavy lifting is still required for many aspects of our industry, so not sure this will all time out well for any of us living in the Apple universe. But I have been wrong on many things. So, back to the topic at hand. If you need professional Blu Ray, I would have it done professionally. If you need to make Blu ray screeners, it's still possible on the Mac but your options are limited.

I think you have to admit, there aren't many situations where you even want to utilize disks anymore. It is kind of clunky technology. If you have to transfer files you can use thumb drives orr any number of other means. as for having someone view your work... why disks? Especially since BR isn't all the hi rez.

Especially since BR isn't all the hi rez. The thing with discs is that they were a standard, especially when you had them made professionally. USB Thumbdrives are a bit all over the place, and depending on what codecs you use, where it will be played from, etc all can factor into viewability. Having said that, I use them all of the time, and one of my favorite tricks is to use a Roku and a USB thumbdrive when I go to show clients a video or when I need to do a screening. So, I'm less stuck on the disc thing and more so on the future of content creation on the Mac. I'm okay with change. I have three projects being cut in FCPX at the moment, I just want Apple to acknowledge that a product like FCPX needs the hardware backbone to keep up with new video technology. I haven't had much luck cutting 8K on an iPhone yet. Three years between pro level system is too long. And for all we know, the nMP may never be updated. But if they are intending on moving forward with it, I think we will need to hear something soon. At least a roadmap for where their professional development is heading.

Bickerstaff View Profile View Forum Posts Private Message Senior Member Join Date Apr 2007 Posts 1,547 10-01-2016, 06:54 PM Apple doesn't want desktop computers to go away, a lack of a Mac Pro update is hardly evidence of that and considering the amount of money you'd spend picking up a 12 core Mac Pro with maxed out ram and disc space is an update timeline 3 years + really that crazy? Supposedly there is a big update coming for the MacBook pro this month so the Mac isn't going anywhere. No one is expecting you to cut 8k on your phone. Though I do think Apple need to come out with a Blu-ray/UHD/DVD authoring app again, they could just update their external super drive to be an UHD Blu-ray burner. Putting all that work into something only to stick it on a thumb drive as an mp4 file or whatever doesn't feel right when I could offer something with a proper menu and some effort put into the packaging. You shouldn't have to spend $50k+ or however much those damn programs cost to develop a disc. http://www.twitter.com/craig_wb     Page 1 of 2 12 Last Jump to page: Quick Navigation Off Topic Top Site Areas Settings Private Messages Subscriptions Who's Online Search Forums Forums Home Forums Red Digital Cinema Recon NAB 2016 DRAGON WEAPON RAVEN RED DISCUSSION Crucial Ordnance EPIC-M OWNERS The DSMC System EPIC RED ONE SCARLET REDLINK DEVELOPERS .

Thanks to Steve Jobs, co-founder of Apple Inc., students have this technology. Unfortunately, Jobs, 56, passed away Wednesday, Oct. 5, due to a rare form of pancreatic cancer. Anything with an “i” before it is Jobs’ doing. Jobs, who dropped out of college after only attending Reed College for six months, started Apple Inc. at an early age and created a totally new culture of technology, including the Mac, iPod, iTunes, iPhone, iTouch, iPad and iPhone. Students and faculty rely heavily on Apple products, especially Macs, for their majors and classes. Associate professor of art Theresa Harris, who teaches graphic design and typography, has been using Macs for a long time and believes they are necessary for her classes. “[Apple] is the industry’s standard,” Harris said. “It’s what over 95 percent of the graphic design industry and design field use as well as fields in video and animation. Everybody is an Apple fan. Jobs’ influence on the graphic design industry cannot be understated. He totally revolutionized the field.” Graphic design major Khalid Spry agrees with Harris when it comes to using Macs for his major. “His products will help me launch my business designing clothing.” As Harris said before, Apple products have been being used for the field of video and animation as well. Jobs was also the owner of the animated film company Pixar. Theatre & Cinema major Carlos Gomez works with Macs all the time for his major and says it’s essential that students can be able to use the technology at Western. “At Western, the Mac labs have been absolutely necessary for our cinema and digital animations majors, which seem to be expanding with the current entertainment industry,” he said. “Mac or PC?” has been a very popular question that has been asked in past years, and Gomez explains why Macs works better for his major. “Apple has the rights to use more powerful software in their computers,” Gomez said. “Apple has the rights to the big filmmaking software, like Final Cut Pro. Although software, like Adobe’s Premiere, is both for a PC and Mac, it was first created for Mac, so the brand trust is with Apple.” Macs have helped a lot of other majors, like journalism for laying out newspaper and yearbook pages, but Apple technology has also changed this generation as a whole. “[Jobs] connects with this generation in terms of music and the visuals and animation in the movies,” Harris said. “It’s a beautiful thing: The way he has this marriage between design and technology, and it just comes together in a wonderful package that is efficient and functions well. He made using technology an experience and made us all want to be a part of that culture.” Even though Jobs has passed away, Spry believes he will not be forgotten. “Steve Jobs will live on as long as you see the Apple mark.” This entry was posted in Features, Lifestyles and tagged death, Ipad, iPod, Legacy, Steve Jobs.

Dela Cruz, UniversityHerald Reporter iPad Air 3 and iPhone 8 Will Hit the Shelves in 2017 with Intel Kaby Lake MacBook Pro? [RUMORS] Apple Unveils New iPad Models (Photo : Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) Year 2017 marks the 10th anniversary of Apple for its iPhone models and MacBook Pro. The tech giant is expected to launch the upgrades of Apple products such as iPad Air 3, iPad Pro, iPhone 8 and the long rumored MacBook Pro with Intel Kaby Lake processor. MacBook Pro (Kaby Lake) Apple is expected to launch a MacBook Pro by the end of October 2016 however the said laptop will be powered by Skylake processor and not with the Kaby Lake, Mac Rumors reported. As Kaby Lake will be released in 2017, Apple is believed to come up with another MacBook Pro within next year bearing the latest Intel chipset. iPad Air 3 (iPad Pro 2) Apple has been rumored to have killed off the iPad Air brand and replaced it with the new iPad Pro 2 instead. It was two years ago when iPad Air 2 was released to the public followed by the launching of an iPad Pro 9.7-inch model back in March 2016, PC Advisor reported. Now, the question that lingers: Is the iPad Pro 2 the new iPad Air 3? Nevertheless, iPad Air 3 (iPad Pro 2) is rumored to be slimmer, thinner and lighter than the 6.1mm iPad Air 2 and 7.5mm iPad Air. Apple is also expected to wrap the new iPad Air 3 with aluminum that will come in four color variants - Gold, Silver, Space Grey and Rose Gold. iPhone 8 iPhone 8 could not be the final name for the next generation iPhone. As revealed by the staff of Apple plant in Israel, the tech giant company may not continue the naming tradition for iPhone and the 2017 iPhone might be called iPhone X. The presumed iPhone 8 is said to become nostalgic as it is believed to be similar with the physical design of the old iPhone 4 according to Mashable where it feature a glass and metal design. The new iPhone is expected to be released during the celebration of the smartphones 10th anniversary come 2017.

The iPhone maker has been found guilty of using VirnetX’s internet security technology in features like FaceTime. The verdict is a let-down for Apple for a case that has been going on since 2010. At first the jury ruled that Apple owed more than $600m to VirnetX, but in August 2016 an appeals court threw the ruling out, saying jurors may have been confused. The latest verdict was handed out by the Eastern District of Texas court, which has gained a reputation for favouring plaintiffs that allege infringement in patent cases, reports say. Both Apple and VirnetX have not issued any statement post the order but Bloomberg reports that Apple is likely to face another round of court proceedings. The court will try to determine whether Apple wilfully infringed the patents and if found guilty, the company could face much higher damages. VirnetX has also filed another patent infringement case against Apple over other security features that include the iMessage application. VirnetX was founded by former employees of government contractor SAIC Inc, and most of its developed technology stems from work done for the CIA for developing secure communications. In fact, the company has been unsuccessful in marketing its own software and mostly relies on patent licensing for revenue. It has only about 20 employees, both part-time and full-time, and got its last payout from Microsoft Corp amounting to $23m. – IBTimes Related Posts Facebook clamps down on graphic content California – Facebook is putting warning labels on graphic videos that members upload and share with friends.   The internet giant will also prevent potentially shocking or upsetting video clips from popping ...

Anytime. Anywhere. NEWS OPS By Mae Anderson. Updated October 1, 2016 11:43AM SHARE ALSO SEE Nintendo Pokemon Go Mobile Gaming Mobile Apps Niantic Activision Does "Pokemon Go" have a second act?The mobile phone app was an instant hit when it debuted in July. Crowds stampeded after a Vaporeon in Central Park and people fell off cliffs playing it in California. At an Apple event on Sept. 7, Niantic CEO John Hanke said 500 million people had downloaded the game in just two months. It was the first mobile game to go mainstream in a big way since "Candy Crush" in 2014 or "Angry Birds" in 2012. It was also the first to incorporate augmented reality, a blending of the real and virtual worlds. But the buzz has decidedly cooled. Last Tuesday, the game ended its reign as the top-grossing U.S. iPhone app after 74 days on top, replaced by "Clash Royale," a popular battling game, according to research firm Sensor Tower. Twitter mentions of the game peaked at 1.7 million on July 11, five days after its launch, according to Adobe Digital Insights. That number had fallen by 98 percent, to 131,000, by Sept. 7, when Apple featured it. Was it all a summer fever dream? While experts say the game is likely to remain popular for a while, it needs to evolve to have real staying power -- just like its namesake digital creatures. "Almost anything of this sort is a fad," says Steve Jones, a communications professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago. "I think we've seen the tapering off." Down But Not Out Of course, an enormous number of people still play the game. Research firm App Annie estimates 1 in 10 smartphone owners in the U.S. are playing; in Japan, that number is 1 in 4. Those U.S. figures are half what App Annie saw the week after the game launched -- but to put them in perspective, they still reflect roughly the same user interest as Twitter or Pinterest. "Pokemon Go" has also been good at keeping people playing after signing up. Its 30-day retention rate is the second best on the Google Play store -- behind "Words with Friends," but ahead of other popular games such as "Clash of Clans" and "Clash Royale." "For a gaming app to be as big as a social network is unprecedented," said Fabien-Pierre Nicolas, a spokesman at App Annie. "Right now, yes, they're losing a million players every week. But they get a million new players every week." The longer users interact with the game, the more time a company has to figure out how to get money from them, Nicolas said. It took a year for some successful games like "Clash of Clans," ''Puzzle" and "Dragon" to earn revenue of $1 billion, but "Pokemon Go" has already made more than $500 million in revenue in two months alone, according to App Annie. The game is free, but lets users purchase items in the game. "Pokemon Go" Evolution But with social chatter dying down and a new smartphone game based on a beloved 1990s character -- "Super Mario Run" -- hitting app stores in December, Pokemon will have to reinvent itself. Kari Amarosso, a public relations manager at Arizona State University, started playing "Pokemon Go" with her 19-year-old son as a fun mother-son summer activity sparked by 1990s Pokemon-card nostalgia. They'd go to the mall or to meetups like one in Tempe, Arizona, where thousands of people walked around Tempe Town Lake capturing digital monsters. But the allure wore off after about six weeks, she said. "I lost interest or just plain forgot to play," she says -- and her son has stopped as well. "His route doesn't change much from work, to home, and he lost interest," she says. Niantic has been trying to freshen things up. In September it introduced a "buddy" system, allowing users to pair up with a Pokemon to scoop up game currency called "candy." It has also debuted an Apple Watch app and introduced a $35 wearable device, Pokemon Go Plus, which lights up and vibrates when you're near a Pokestop or a newly appeared Pokemon. Niantic did not respond to a request for comment. Hasn't Caught Them All Jones suggests the company needs to do more to keep people interested -- for example, by adding some kind of social element so that players can interact with each other. His two teenage sons, he notes, have grown slightly less enchanted with the game. "Young people are used to doing social media and there isn't really messaging as part of the game," Jones said. There have been persistent rumors that Niantic plans to let players trade captured Pokemon with one another, although the company hasn't commented on that. The big challenge for "Pokemon Go" is to avoid the fate of "Candy Crush," says Pace University marketing professor Larry Chiagouris. Created by King Digital, "Candy Crush" because a smash hit; Activision Blizzard subsequently bought King for $5.9 billion. But while people still play the game, the fervor around it has died down. When the game was at its peak, "you were getting invited to play Candy Crush every day" on Facebook, he said.

Just think about how your life would change in a jiffy! It sounds pretty cool, huh? If you were reading my other “hacking related” articles like this one, you might think that, oh well, maybe I’ll give it a try, I could use 1.5 million bucks around the house. Maybe I’ll fix the roof, maybe I’ll relocate to Hawaii, you know what I mean? But the weird thing is that the respective bounty is not offered by Apple. Thing is, today’s news is a true shocker for the Cupertino based company, as the hefty reward comes from Zerodium, which is  something between a black hat and a white hat organization, a shade of gray if you like. Basically, these guys are offering a huge amount of cash for an iOS 10 Zero Day exploit,  a sum which is 7 times more than Apple themselves are putting on the table. Indeed, Apple too thought about using this clever trick, i.e. to motivate the hackers out there, the free market sort to speak, in order to improve their iOS 10 security, just like Google was doing for quite some time now. Zerodium is actually a start-up company, the brain-child of the infamous French based Vupen, and these guys are very smart in this writer’s opinion. Their modus operandi is to buy exploits and things of that nature from “wild hackers” and then to sell them to governments and companies and then again, to who knows whom (for more dough obviously)? Zerodium offered half a mil in the past for an iOS 9 zero-day exploit, but now they upped the ante three fold for iOS 10. To get the $1.5 million, you’ll have to deliver a previously unknown Zero Day Exploit for iOS 10, as in a remote jailbreak which allows a 3rd party full control over the respective device. The same story goes for a remote jailbreak over an Android 7 Nougat running device, but the bounty is just $200,000.

The scene, captured on camera and posted on the internet, has gone viral in France. In it, the man walks into the store in a shopping mall in Dijon, central-eastern France, and pounds the screens of Apple products with a heavy fist-sized metal ball used in petanque, a French bowling game.

Apple, with its huge pile of cash, is hiding behind the rule that taxation takes place where value is created. It makes it exceedingly difficult for authorities to work out how much value is created in which country. October 01, 2016, 9:29 pm/ 5 Comments SHARE : Waqas Shabbir Tweet The European commission’s ruling about Apple has once again highlighted the greed culture and inappropriate behavior of global corporate giants like Google, Starbucks, General Motors & Amazon – especially, when it comes to paying taxes. The history of Apple’s irresponsible behavior, recklessness & greed seriously questions the company’s CSR initiatives. Apple is known to exploit small mines: 70% of the tin used in Apple products comes from illegal mines. Middlemen use the small mine operators & workers who partake in delivering the product to Apple are still living in appalling conditions & are deprived of minimum wage. With a surge in suicide cases at Apple’s manufacturing plants, the appalling conditions and plight of the workers was an open secret which led to worldwide condemnation of Apple’s greed and immoral behavior. Though, Apple had defended itself by arguing that it is doing more than other businesses to ensure the safety of its workers but the reality looks the opposite. What about the workers at Apple’s manufacturing plants, do they have the choice to avoid such poor work life balance, where they work relentlessly to meet their life’s demands? With so much talk on China’s transition from a growth-based economy to a quality-based one, how long will these catastrophic work practices be allowed? Nobody is demanding for a six hour work day like Sweden, where such a model failed to bring dividends, but some respite for workers is needed. In a country where Panama leaks failed to avert the minds of the voters & accountability institutions failed to be jerked into starting an investigation into the corrupt elite, can such scandal really change the minds of buyers about a tax thief & manipulator like Apple, which has blatantly used its advantageous position to forge a deal with the Irish? For a very long time, Apple had been a beneficiary of the lose tax policies of the Republic of Ireland. It struck an extraordinary deal with Ireland, which helped the company avoid tax bills on sales in most of the global markets. Apple has been penalized for its aggressive corporate tax avoidance. Ironically, the tech giant had been legally evading taxes. It was concluded by the fact finding committee in to Apple’s tax irregularities that such tax related privileges & arrangements were specifically designed to facilitate the company. Some extraordinary arrangements were made using the rulings of 1991 & 2007, entailing the allocation of profits to Apple’s Head Office situated in Cork but, with no premises or staff. The head office exists only on paper & all the profits from Europe, India, Middle East and Africa were recorded in Ireland with no staff. One of the most astonishing revelations made regarding this scandal, was that in the financial year (FY) 2011, one of Apple’s subsidiaries, “Apple Sales International”, recorded 16bn Euros in profit & Apple paid a mindboggling 10 million Euros, which was only 0.05% of the profits. Isn’t it unrealistic? This special arrangement allowed Apple to conceal its actual position & gave a significant unfair advantage to the company against other companies operating in Europe. Other than the poor workers working long shifts to feed the ever growing demand for Apple’s products, continents and countries are also victims of Apple’s greed. In an open letter, Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO, reaffirmed that Apple is committed to serve communities around the world – wherever it operates – and plays a crucial part in lifting the local economies through investment & employment opportunities. He was quite stern in his response, declaring that Apple pays & will continue to pay a bulk of taxes only where value is created. Does that mean that in areas other than Cork & California, where it sells its products, Apple will not pay taxes? Some questions remain to be answered by the authorities in Brussels: Why did Apple never pay the taxes in the countries where it earned the profits? Why was Apple allowed to take illegal state aid in Europe under the noses of the European Commission for so long? It is time for stern actions to be taken against those who make a mockery of the system and play and use the peculiar tax rules. The culprits in such a setup are not limited to the companies in question, but it also includes the financial advisers & countries which benefit from these handful of companies, by bending the rules to benefit a select few at the cost of common tax payers. Apple, with its huge pile of cash, is hiding behind the rule that taxation takes place where value is created. It makes it exceedingly difficult for authorities to work out how much value is created in which country. It works in favor of culprits like Apple who act like true capitalists: it maintains huge margins on its products, but fails miserably to share the cherry with rest of the world. Tim Cook’s response via a letter laments the authorities at the helm in Brussels. His letter also makes it clear the Apple workers working in mines in Indonesia are not value creators. A worker working in China at its manufacturing plant is also not a value creator. And those suffering after being exposed to hazardous substances in Chinese factories are not value creators, at all! What really matters is how conscious today’s consumer is about the business practices of products he or she uses. How many of Apple’s potential consumers will give the new iPhone 7 a miss, after learning about the company’s unethical practices? Is it possible for consumers to behave more prudently and value the ethical & moral behavior of the seller more than the satisfaction derived from the use of its products? It totally depends on people’s attitude towards morality and goodness. Would you really want to possess a product of a company which values hoarding big sums of money supposedly to be used partly for value creation, and shows reluctance to spend on those who create value for it? When those who played a key role in value creation are deprived of their share, how on earth could one expect Apple to show any respect towards the outsiders? Karl Marx was not wrong, when he argued, that the “contradictions of a market based on other nexus between man and man than naked self-interest, than callous ‘cash payment’, a system of exploitation and of endless accumulation can never be overcome; that at some point in a series of transformations and restructuring the development of this essentially destabilizing system will lead to a state of affairs that can no longer be described as capitalism."

Friday November 18, 2016 US WORLD PERSECUTION MINISTRY CULTURE VIDEO Subscriptions Homepage WORLD iPad Air 3 release date, specs rumors: New and much-improved specs to be featured in the new iPad Air iteration Arvin Donguines 01 October, 2016 11:55 AM Like Us Share on Facebook Share on Twitter (Apple website)The iPad Air 2. As of this writing date, Apple remains tight-lipped whether or not they will indeed be releasing the next generation of its iPad Air tablet line, the Apple iPad Air 3. Rumors that were picked up recently indicate that the Cupertino-based tech giant might have already scrapped the entire tech series to put more focus in developing the purported new iterations of the iPad Pro tablet line, which is slated to be rolled out with a "revolutionary" OLED display by as early as 2018, Mac Rumors wrote. The latter device is further believed to come along with high-end hardware and features aside from its 9.7-inch screen. In the case of the iPad Air 3 being shelved, the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus maker is yet to confirm but the speculations are rife pointing out to the possibility that it will eventually hit the market as a low to mid-end alternative, according to a report. With its release date, there's still no substantial information that can pinpoint the exact date. Although, the latest rumblings indicate that it could find its way to the street by the first quarter of 2017, probably no later than April, if this is the case. The reported specs of the iPad Air 3 could definitely be a reason for consumers to cross their fingers and wait for the upcoming device. A roundup of details from a particular publication said that the tablet will be made available with an Apple pencil connectivity. If this turns out to be true, then it will come in the ranks of the 12.9-inch iPad Pro which is currently the only iPad that can be used with the said proprietary pointing and writing device. Speaking about its dimensions, the iPad Air 3 might be displayed in the Apple Stores with a much thinner body than its direct predecessor, the iPad Air 2, which is 6.1 mm thick. Under the hood, the new gadget is expected to sport Apple's latest chipset, the A10. Watch out for more updates.

Thanks to services like Apple Music, Spotify, iTunes and YouTube, the ability to listen to music from across the world has never been more affordable or accessible. But with so many avenues to listen to music, accessing your favorite songs and playlists across varying services can often be an exercise in frustration. When Apple Music first debuted, for example, many people were eager to see what Apple’s take on music streaming was like. One downside, though, is that users who had previously built-up playlists on sites like Spotify had no way to export them to Apple Music. At long last, there’s now a new iOS app that promises to solve this admittedly first-world problem. DON’T MISS: Yup, now the iPhone 7 is exploding Dubbed 25 Most Played, the app is rather simple but extremely helpful. In short, it lets users “import, share, find, follow and port” playlists across Spotify, YouTube, Apple Music and iTunes. In other words, if you’ve got an extensive number of carefully constructed playlists on iTunes from back in the day, 25 Most Played promises to make it a breeze to import it into any music service of your choosing. The app description reads in part: 25 Most Played is a free music app for finding, managing, and following music playlists for iTunes and Apple Music, Spotify, and YouTube. Import your playlists from one service and play them on another. And if you are moving to a new music streaming service, 25 Most Played can port your playlists for you. … 25 Most Played allows you to follow playlists created by your friends on other streaming services and listen to them on the music streaming service you use – even with the videos on YouTube. Import your playlists so you can play them at parties even if the host doesn’t use the same platform as you. Find playlists created by your friends, by people in your city, or by strangers with good music taste and save them to your home screen so they are easy to find and play via the music streaming service you prefer. Will Apple eventually remove the app? It's hard to say but it certainly wouldn’t surprise us. Which is to say, if you’re at all protective and serious about your musical playlists, you might want to try downloading this app (accessible via the source link below) as soon possible.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Oct 1, 2016 at 11:22AM Image source: Apple.  Although the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone 7 series smartphones only recently launched, credible rumors surrounding the iDevice maker's next-generation iPhone -- which many expect to be called the iPhone 8 -- are already circulating. The latest set of rumors comes from the generally reliable (and always interesting) Ming-Chi Kuo with KGI Securities (via AppleInsider). There's some interesting stuff here, so let's see what he has to say. Glass bodies with metal frames Kuo expects that next year's iPhones will feature glass backs with metal frames, as phones with all-glass chassis aren't currently feasible "given technological bottlenecks." The analyst expects that Apple's more mainstream smartphones will feature aluminum frames while more premium models may be differentiated by the use of more expensive -- though, according to the analyst, more aesthetically pleasing -- stainless steel frames. Kuo says one of the key reasons Apple wants to move to glass is that producing the glossy finish that's currently used in the popular jet-black variants of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus is difficult. He cites manufacturing yields of between 60% and 70%. He also points out that a glass back will allow for "better scratch resistance," something that he claims will "improve user satisfaction." A couple of business takeaways It's quite interesting that Apple appears to be planning to more aggressively segment its product portfolio. This is hardly a new practice in the world of consumer electronics, but such segmentation actions are relatively new to Apple's iPhone business. I suspect that there are a couple of key business realities driving Apple to be more aggressive on this front. First, Apple simply has far more resources to invest today than it did during the early innings of the iPhone. Indeed, Apple's research-and-development spending has soared over the past decade (see the chart below), as the company's successes with the iPod, iPhone, iPad, and the Mac have allowed it to invest substantially more into the development of future products.  AAPL Research and Development Expense (TTM) data by YCharts Building and ramping up into producing multiple variants of a product is no trivial task. However, the company's research and development budget is roughly an order of magnitude greater than it was back in 2007. Indeed, Apple's product development budget is up more than a factor of three from where it was just four short years ago. Next, the smartphone market itself is no longer growing at the high rates that it had previously. That means Apple can't rely on the rising industry tide to lift its iPhone business. It needs to be aggressive about building and offering a broader and deeper portfolio of products to service as many potential customers as possible. The reality is that the look and feel of a smartphone is an important selling point, and it's likely that the iDevice maker will be able to get a significant portion of its customers to pay more for a more "premium" looking design. The glass-backed model with an aluminum frame should be a premium design in its own right, but I'd imagine that there are customers that would choose to buy higher-end iPhones (for example, phones with larger on-board storage) simply for the even more premium look and feel of an iPhone with a stainless steel frame.  And finally, at some point it simply becomes hard to gain further market share and grow unit shipments, even with a broader portfolio of products. This means that Apple is going to sell a richer mix of products. Apple has historically differentiated iPhones by storage tiers and, recently, by size (the iPhones with 5.5-inch displays command a significant premium to the ones with 4.7-inch displays).  With increasing differentiation of higher end models (through both look and feel, as well as potentially technical specifications), Apple could very well drive a significant boost in iPhone average selling prices. It would seem that Apple's executive team is keenly aware of these business realities and, as a result, is changing up its product development strategy in a bid to capture as much of the revenue and profit dollars in the industry as possible. It's a good strategy, and as we see it really play out over the next couple of years, Apple's shareholders should be handsomely rewarded in the form of a return to iPhone unit growth and richer average selling prices.

The case will now go to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, DC. Virnetx is a communications technology company founded by a group of employees at the Science Applications International Corp. (SAIC) which developed security technology for various federal agencies. However, the company is regularly described as a patent troll, making most of its revenue through licensing the patents that it holds. The company has instigated lawsuits against Microsoft and Cisco. This is the third trial between the two companies This is the third time that Apple and VirnetX have gone to court over this issue. In 2010, VirnetX sued Apple, alleging that it had infringed on four patents. While the court ordered that Apple pay $368.2 million to VirnetX’s, the suit was thrown out by the US Court of Appeals. A second trial earlier this year resulted in another win for VirnetX, but a trial judge overturned the $625.6 million fine for Apple in July. VirnetX won’t see this payout right away. The case will now go to the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, DC, according to Bloomberg. The court has a long history of ruling on patent cases, and will examine the case according to two standards to determine whether or not Apple infringed on the patents: the one used by the US Patent and Trademark Office, as well as the one used by the District Court in Texas. The court will need to find that Apple has violated both standards in order to award the fine to VirnetX.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Apple's iOS 10 Adoption Rate hits 55% in the U.S. in just Weeks | Main | Samsung Changes the Ball Game with Next-Gen Universal Remote Controller for Home Automation » October 01, 2016 Tim Cook Highlighted Augmented Reality and Privacy at Packed House at Utah's Tech Tour Event Last Night   We reported on Thursday that Senator Hatch would be hosting Apple's CEO Tim Cook in a special Q&A session on Friday at the Grand America in Salt Lake City. As noted by our cover graphic, the Imperial Ballroom was packed to hear Tim Cook speaking. Desert News Utah reported late yesterday that "To many in the tech world, getting a glimpse of Apple's CEO is akin to music fans seeing their favorite rock star. To millions around the world, Apple CEO Tim Cook is the rock star of tech — the living embodiment of success and innovation."   Considering that Apple has 50,000 registered iOS developers in Utah it was no wonder why the crowd was so enthusiastic to hear Cook talk. One of the topics Cook delved into was privacy.   Cook talked up the promise of the emerging field of augmented reality, underscored digital photo technology's importance to personal memories and described lasting impacts on Apple from its legendary Apple founder Steve Jobs.   On a personal note, Cook said that 'I never thought it possible.' But he received the 'call of a lifetime' from founder Steve Jobs in early 1998. 'Five minutes into the discussion with him, I wanted to throw caution to the wind and join Apple,' Cook said. 'And it was the best decision I ever made.'"   When asked about the future of encryption as it relates to maintaining privacy of digital communication, Cook said his company is dedicated to keeping their customers' information as safe as possible from hackers and also from government intrusion.   "This is one of the biggest issues that we face," Cook said. "Encryption is one of the things that makes the public safe. We believe the only way to protect both your privacy and safety from a cyberattack is to encrypt."   Most of what Cook spoke about has been covered a million times before, but if you want to read up on it all, then check out the reports from Desert News Utah and The Salt Lake Tribune.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Powers Finds Apple Music Customers Have Highest Customer Satisfaction Bryan Chaffin @TMOBryan · +Bryan Chaffin Oct 1st, 2016 8:30 AM EST | Analysis J.D. Powers found that Apple Music customers have the highest customer satisfaction ratings amongst streaming music services. In a report authored by Kirk Parsons, the firm attributed those results, in part, to the strength of Apple’s ecosystem. Apple Music Extends the Ecosystem Apple makes money from its services. Growth in services revenue was a bright spot in two most recent and otherwise lackluster quarters. But Apple CEO Tim Cook and his executive team have made it clear that services support the ecosystem and the hardware. Source: J.D. Powers The J.D. Powers report suggests this strategy is working, and that the ecosystem makes Apple Music Customers more satisfied. It also makes them more satisfied with the ecosystem. It’s an ouroboros of happy, paying customers. “Apple Music has the highest incidence of customers who say they selected their provider because it is part of their device ecosystem, and the brand’s phone and tablet customers have the highest levels of commitment,” the report argued. “Apple Music customers have the highest incidence of saying they ‘strongly agree’ that they are committed to their streaming provider (35%), and this incidence is highest by a considerable margin.” This expertly highlights what J.D. Powers characterized as Apple’s “advantage” in offering a whole widget model married to a curated, walled garden. No other company on the planet can touch that advantage. That upstart Apple Music beat every pre-existing streaming service in satisfaction ratings is the proof in that pudding. It should also give those who doubted (or continue to doubt) the wisdom of Apple’s purchase of Beats. Apple Music is clearly well positioned to help Apple sell more devices. These satisfaction numbers are meaningful. Paying Customers are Happier A non Apple-specific aside: one of the most fascinating aspects of this report is the news that paying customers are “significantly” happier with their streaming services than free users. J.D. Powers found that overall satisfaction for paying users was 825, while free users averaged 803. Differences in Customer Service satisfaction were more pronounced. The report said they measured, “significantly higher among paid users (846) than among free users (772).” Communication satisfaction was also cited as “significant” at 800 for paid users and 752 for free users. I suppose it stands to reason that people willing to pay for a service are more likely to be happy with that service. This could also be a general statement on the predisposition of people willing to pay for a service and those not willing to pay for their services. There’s a PhD or two waiting to be earned studying that sort of thing. Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn Reddit Tags: Apple, Apple Music, J.D.

Maria Bernadette Castro01 October, 2016 (REUTERS/Beck Diefenbac)The existing iPad Pro was revealed during an Apple media event on Sept. 9, 2015. Sponsored Watch Your Favorite Christian Films, 24/7. Click Here To Start Your Free Trial Today The iPad Pro 2 is one of the most awaited devices from Apple, but those who are looking for a massive design tweak on the sequel will have to look elsewhere. It is being said that the giant tablet will get some big changes in the design department as Apple focuses on bulking it up on the inside. According to KGI Securities Ming-Chi Kuo, the iPad Pro 2 will be powered by the A10X processor, the latest and most powerful version of Apple's very own line of chipsets. However, there are reports going around that the second-generation iPad Pro will do away with the 3.5-millimeter, much like the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. There is no confirmation for that yet although Apple appears to be considering the possibility. The company is in fact looking into removing the headphone jack from the MacBook Pro as well, at least according to a survey it sent out to its users. Meanwhile, Bloomberg has also reported that the Cupertino-based company wants to focus on software upgrades by making the most of the all new iOS 10 operating system. One of the tech firm's biggest focuses is the Apple Pencil, which, as per the above-mentioned site will be designed into "a handwriting and drawing stylus aimed at professionals." The stylus will give the iPad Pro 2 users the power to annotate objects across the whole operating system not just in certain applications. Apple currently only has this possible in specifically developed apps. But for the iPad Pro 2, the Apple Pencil will allow users to make annotations across the board in various applications including Mail, the Safari web browser, and iMessage. With regards to the release date, the iPad Pro 2 is expected to be released early next year with a new 10.5-inch iPad Pro and the low-cost iPad with 9.7-inch display.

Dela Cruz, UniversityHerald Reporter Top 5 Reasons Why Apple iPad Air 3 Release Date is Worth the Wait? Apple Unveils New iPad Models (Photo : Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) Apple has been rumored to have killed off the iPad Air brand but it turns out as a surprise for everyone when a valid report revealed about the upcoming iPad Air and Pro brands. Loyal Apple fans are drooling over the latest tweaks on the two configurations. The following expected features proved that iPad Air 3 release date is worth the wait. New Configuration - iPad Pro Apple is not finish with the iPad Air brand yet. Instead, the tech giant is rumored to have been added the new configuration iPad Pro according to Mac World. Although it is not yet confirmed, according to the same report netizens speculate on 9.7-inch iPad Pro and iPad Air with a screen resolution of 2048 x 1536 (264 ppi pixel density). Smart Connector for Smart Keyboard Rumors suggesting that a Smart Keyboard Cover will be attach to a Smart Connector located on the left hand edge of the upcoming iPad Air 3. This functionality allows the connected keyboard cover to draw power from the monster battery of iPad Air 3 through the use of Smart Connector. Apple Pencil Compatibility The 12.9-inch iPad Pro is the only Apple tablet that is compatible with Apple pencil when it was launched. It has become the unique selling point of the device at that time. Apple has been flooded with lots of user request for Apple pencil compatibilities with their tablets and the Cupertino-based is rumored to have started the works in the 9.7-inch iPad Pro. Thinner than iPad Air 2 The original iPad Air is 7.5mm thick followed by the iPad Air 2 which is 6.1mm thick. For this matter, Apple is expected to surprise the loyal fans with an iPad Air 3 thinner than 6.1mm according to PC Advisor. Thus, a more powerful but smaller battery is believed to power the new iPad Air model. New Processor iPad Air 3 is rumored to be powered by Apple's proprietary chipset the A10. Similar chips have powered the newly launched iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus which both received good reviews due to excellent device performance.

Rick Munarriz (TMFBreakerRick) Oct 1, 2016 at 9:18AM Image source: Netflix. It's a new month, but October won't be just any month for a few companies. Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG), and GoPro (NASDAQ:GPRO) have a lot riding on events that will play out in the coming weeks. Will the looming catalysts be positive or blow up in investors' faces? Some will offer tricks. Some will offer treats. Let's size up why all four of those stocks could be in for a wild October. Keep your subs above water Netflix reports quarterly results on Oct. 17, and it's going to be an important checkup for the leading premium streaming service. Netflix fell short of subscriber targets during the second quarter, a rare miss for a company that has historically offered conservative guidance that it can easily beat. It also served up uninspiring guidance for the third quarter, and now there are fears that it didn't set the bar low enough. Big-data analytics specialist M Science is forecasting that Netflix gained as many domestic subscribers as it lost during the quarter, well short of the 300,000 net additions that Netflix itself was projecting earlier this summer. This was already going to be a challenging quarter. Longtime subscribers who were grandfathered into the original rate of $7.99 a month for the flagship streaming service when it was bumped up to $8.99 more than two years ago and $9.99 last year now have to pay the current rate. However, that change should have already been baked into Netflix's original outlook. Most of Netflix's growth over the past two years has come from its international gains, but there will be a jolt to the stock if stateside subscribers are peaking.  Smartphones don't know everything September treated iFans to the updated iPhone 7 and Apple Watch Series 2, but Apple was mysteriously silent in pushing out sales data for the iPhone's debut weekend. It warned that it would no longer be doing this -- and a supply shortage on the iPhone Plus end didn't help -- but this does make Apple's Oct. 27 earnings report more interesting than usual. We will finally get sales data on the iPhone and the new Apple Watch, at least through the end of September. Analysts have been warming up to Apple this summer. The iPhone 7 launch appears to be going better than expected, as many were writing it off until we get to next year's 10th anniversary edition. We'll get the final word on initial demand by the end of this new month.  Rolling with the changes Chipotle is another battleground stock that will be posting fresh financials this month. The burrito roller's chance to shine will be Oct. 25, but to be fair, no one is expecting it to shine. Stores continued to post double-digit declines in comps through July, and all indications suggest that this will be the chain's fourth straight quarter of brutal negative same-restaurant sales. This is still the most important quarter since a couple of foodborne-illness outbreaks sent patrons scurrying from the once darling brand late last year. This was the quarter of Chiptopia, the three-month promotion that was supposed to make its most loyal customers come back more often. Chipotle's guidance will also be critical, since the year-over-year comparisons should start to get kinder once we get to November, when the negative press began to sting sales last year. Cameras take flight Netflix, Apple, and Chipotle have big quarterly reports to dole out this month. GoPro does, too -- it should report near the end of the month -- but the real stock movers will be tomorrow's debut of Hero5 and the Oct. 23 rollout of GoPro's Karma drone. Like Chipotle, GoPro's coming off three brutal quarters of sharp sales declines. The path is clearer for a turnaround at GoPro, where analysts see a sharp rebound in sales by the holiday quarter. The new products will go a long way toward getting GoPro there.  Netflix, Apple, Chipotle, and GoPro will be watched closely this month. Expect all four stocks to be volatile as they either step up to the challenge or fall short.  Rick Munarriz owns shares of Apple and Netflix.

My Profile My Subscriptions Log Out New Brunswick LIVE NB More Streams Radio One Listen Live CBC News Canada CBC News Navigation Home Opinion World Canada Politics Business Health Entertainment Technology & Science Video Canada NB New Brunswick U-picks open for business Crop is good, but could have used a little more rain By Jordan Gill, CBC News Posted: Oct 01, 2016 11:00 AM AT Last Updated: Oct 01, 2016 11:00 AM AT Apples are ripening at the MacKay Apple Orchard, and will continue into late October. (Facebook) Cider and Cortlands and Macs! Oh pie! 8:33 The temperature has dropped into the teens on many days and for many New Brunswickers that means a trip to a local U-pick. Chas MacKay runs MacKay Apple Orchard on the Kingston Peninsula and says the apple crop is good, but he could have used a little more rain. "The thing with rain, and growing apples, it's timing. You'd like to get it at certain times and other times you don't want it at all," said MacKay. McIntosh apples have been ripe for a while now and Cortlands are just beginning to ripen at MacKay's orchard. One thing MacKay has noticed is how people are picking apples. He said at one time people wouldn't pick from the tree, believing only apples that had fallen were ripe. "Everything's changed now. Those stories about picking off the ground, or giving the tree a little shake and the ones that fall are the ones that are ripe, it's kind of changed," said MacKay. While going to a U-pick may now seem like a traditional event, it wasn't always that way. MacKay said the way apple producers make their living has changed quite a bit over the years. "There was a time when I used to sell all my apples, 100 per cent, through stores. And then it changed [to] the U-pick," said MacKay MacKay said the change was spurred in part to a preference from stores to get all their apples from one large producer, as opposed to many smaller ones. When he first started the U-pick he would have to advertise in newspapers and you could never count on a crowd. But technology has changed that. "With Facebook that's all changed. You get too many people sometimes," said MacKay. MacKay's U-pick has one leg up on the grocery store — a greater variety of product. "I've got some apples here that you'll never see them in the stores … they don't have a big shelf life," said MacKay. Just remember the apple season doesn't end after the Thanksgiving holiday. "I've got apples available sort of two weeks after Thanksgiving. But by that time U-picking and going out in the country isn't on people's minds," said MacKay. With files from Shift.

As you can see in the chart below which compares US iPhone users of iOS 10 to iOS 9,  iOS 10 has a 55% to 45% advantage, respectively. Internationally, the numbers are 48% and 52% for iOS 10 and iOS 9, respectively. These figures are corroborated by Mixpanel as well. For more on this, read the full AppLovin report here.   In stark contrast, Google's own recent statistics that are noted below, show last year's Marshmallow release running on less than 19 percent of devices, with 35 percent running Lollipop and nearly 28 percent running KitKat. Some 15 percent of devices are still running 2012's Jelly Bean and 3 percent are using an even older version.   And lastly, even though Android's latest OS called Nougat has been out for a little over a month now, there's still no data about its adoption rate. It's likely a cringingly dismal number considering that Android-Marshmallow was released in October 2015 and it was only able to rack up 18.7% over the entire year.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Rick Munarriz (TMFBreakerRick) Oct 1, 2016 at 9:18AM Image source: Netflix. It's a new month, but October won't be just any month for a few companies. Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG), and GoPro (NASDAQ:GPRO) have a lot riding on events that will play out in the coming weeks. Will the looming catalysts be positive or blow up in investors' faces? Some will offer tricks. Some will offer treats. Let's size up why all four of those stocks could be in for a wild October. Keep your subs above water Netflix reports quarterly results on Oct. 17, and it's going to be an important checkup for the leading premium streaming service. Netflix fell short of subscriber targets during the second quarter, a rare miss for a company that has historically offered conservative guidance that it can easily beat. It also served up uninspiring guidance for the third quarter, and now there are fears that it didn't set the bar low enough. Big-data analytics specialist M Science is forecasting that Netflix gained as many domestic subscribers as it lost during the quarter, well short of the 300,000 net additions that Netflix itself was projecting earlier this summer. This was already going to be a challenging quarter. Longtime subscribers who were grandfathered into the original rate of $7.99 a month for the flagship streaming service when it was bumped up to $8.99 more than two years ago and $9.99 last year now have to pay the current rate. However, that change should have already been baked into Netflix's original outlook. Most of Netflix's growth over the past two years has come from its international gains, but there will be a jolt to the stock if stateside subscribers are peaking.  Smartphones don't know everything September treated iFans to the updated iPhone 7 and Apple Watch Series 2, but Apple was mysteriously silent in pushing out sales data for the iPhone's debut weekend. It warned that it would no longer be doing this -- and a supply shortage on the iPhone Plus end didn't help -- but this does make Apple's Oct. 27 earnings report more interesting than usual. We will finally get sales data on the iPhone and the new Apple Watch, at least through the end of September. Analysts have been warming up to Apple this summer. The iPhone 7 launch appears to be going better than expected, as many were writing it off until we get to next year's 10th anniversary edition. We'll get the final word on initial demand by the end of this new month.  Rolling with the changes Chipotle is another battleground stock that will be posting fresh financials this month. The burrito roller's chance to shine will be Oct. 25, but to be fair, no one is expecting it to shine. Stores continued to post double-digit declines in comps through July, and all indications suggest that this will be the chain's fourth straight quarter of brutal negative same-restaurant sales. This is still the most important quarter since a couple of foodborne-illness outbreaks sent patrons scurrying from the once darling brand late last year. This was the quarter of Chiptopia, the three-month promotion that was supposed to make its most loyal customers come back more often. Chipotle's guidance will also be critical, since the year-over-year comparisons should start to get kinder once we get to November, when the negative press began to sting sales last year. Cameras take flight Netflix, Apple, and Chipotle have big quarterly reports to dole out this month. GoPro does, too -- it should report near the end of the month -- but the real stock movers will be tomorrow's debut of Hero5 and the Oct. 23 rollout of GoPro's Karma drone. Like Chipotle, GoPro's coming off three brutal quarters of sharp sales declines. The path is clearer for a turnaround at GoPro, where analysts see a sharp rebound in sales by the holiday quarter. The new products will go a long way toward getting GoPro there.  Netflix, Apple, Chipotle, and GoPro will be watched closely this month. Expect all four stocks to be volatile as they either step up to the challenge or fall short.  Rick Munarriz owns shares of Apple and Netflix.

Hello Blog Book Talk Work Contact 30 Sep 16 My visit to the Apple Museum There is a long list of must-do things for anyone who visits Prague. Like the Charles Bridge, built in 1538. Or the Prague Castle, largest of the world’s ancient castles, dating back to the 9th century. But hell, Prague is also home to the world’s only Apple Museum — which dates all the way back to 2015. And, as an Apple enthusiast, I do have to keep my priorities straight. So, yes, I did visit the Apple Museum on my first day in the Czech Republic last week. (Do I get any points if I walked across the Charles Bridge to get there?) I even sat down with the museum’s manager days later to learn a bit more. Now that I’m back in New York, here are some photos and observations from my little adventure. The Apple Museum is located in a tourist area amid the winding streets of Prague. When I hovered outside the entrance, a museum employee tried to lure me in with a free Apple. (That’s him above.) Little did he know I didn’t need any luring. The signage, inside and out, is set in pixelated Chicago type, harking back to the early days of Macintosh. And, of course, the old rainbow Apple logo is in ample supply. One of the front windows contains a new version of the famous multi-colored iMac “Yum” ad, this one made up of actual computers. Kinda cool and kinda funky all at once. Before I even entered the museum, I did experience one traumatic event. Right there under those colorful iMacs were the words “Think Different.” While many will not notice the grave error in that, the detail-obsessed Apple fan is likely aware that the d in different was never capitalized in Apple’s marketing. It was a simple sentence: Think different. (Just as it is in the actual ads inside the museum.) Steve Jobs might have had someone’s head over that one. Fortunately, I was able to recover from this shock and get on with my mission. The museum houses an extensive private collection of Apple/Steve Jobs technology and artifacts. I’m not sure how a private person amasses such a collection, as some of the items are incredibly valuable or incredibly hard to find. Like the Apple I computer that started it all — complete with a Panasonic cassette deck serving as a data storage device. Of course, there is also an Apple II computer under glass. Embarrassingly, I confess that this computer was actually my point of entry into the Apple world, well before I ever dreamed of creating Apple ads. Except that mine was decked out with two floppy drives. Hey, I was a power user. If it’s beige you seek, there’s plenty of it — from the Apple II, Apple III and Macintosh computers through the Performas and other unmentionables. Having been involved in the introduction of iMac, I found myself staring wistfully at the early models, from Bondi Blue to the multi-colored second generation, to the highly questionable, artistically patterned iMacs (even Jony Ive has his lapses), to the more modern computers shown here. One thing I did not expect to see was the first model of iPod, signed on the back by Steve Jobs himself. Impressive. Given that this is the device that literally changed the course of Apple, this would be the one item in the museum I’d most like to own. (Unfortunately, it was well sealed under glass.) Another nice display is that of Apple’s laptop computers, arranged so one can appreciate just how they’ve evolved over time. I well remember gushing over the first iBooks, silly as they might look today. And of course no history of Steve Jobs would be complete without some items relating to NeXT and Pixar. Both displays are rather small compared to the attention paid to Apple products, but a nice addition. I still regret selling my NeXT Computer. I also wonder if I’ll ever be able to get my data off the NeXT optical disk I kept. Surely there are some old NeXT ad ideas hiding in there. I thought I’d come to the end when I realized there was actually a downstairs as well. It’s kind of dungeon-like down there, but architecturally interesting. It makes you realize how old these buildings are. There are no Apple relics to see below, but some Apple-focused art instead. Most prevalent are a number of paintings—the two Steves and some of the “Crazy Ones” from the Think different campaign. (More than what’s shown here.) But this part is more of a “tribute” area than anything of historic value. Though the museum doesn’t look big from the outside, it feels quite spacious by the time you’ve finished exploring. There were Apple products I had totally forgotten about (lots of peripherals and accessories), and I couldn’t think of any glaring omissions. There’s even a Steve Jobs business card from Apple’s earliest days. And then when you leave—or when you enter, actually—there’s Steven’s Food, which serves up natural treats in the Jobs tradition. On the opposite wall is an appropriately placed “Yum” poster. Walking around this place did make me a bit wispy and emotional. It reminded me how fortunate I was to have had a hand in the marketing of many of these objects—and not get stuck in some ad agency writing ads for insurance or toilet paper. So I left the museum with my thirst for Apple history well satiated. The Apple Museum has the trappings of a homemade museum—don’t expect the Louvre—but in a way that’s perfectly appropriate for a company that started in a garage. The displays are professionally laid out, and anyone interested in Apple history would greatly enjoy spending an hour there. Before I end, I have to say — I really, really love Prague. Despite the way I started this article, the Apple Museum is but one small part of a truly amazing city. Such history and architecture, and a terrific community of creative people. I highly recommend a visit. And while you’re there, I know where you can get a free Apple.

This was the day when Apple finally took the wraps off its new iPhone generation after several months full of controversy, mostly fueled by leaks that pointed to the changes Cupertino planned for its flagship product. And truth be told, many of the changes that showed up in leaks earlier this year made their way onto the iPhone 7, and this is why we now have a phone without a headphone jack and a secondary speaker grille that hides virtually… nothing. Leaving aside all the criticism, the iPhone 7 is here and Apple launched it with much fanfare, describing it as “the best iPhone ever.” Cupertino obviously praised pretty much every single change that it made on this phone, even those that were highly criticized - as is the case of the headphone jack - and talked about the removal of some options as an act of courage, a thing that Steve Jobs himself described as something that Apple needs to do because of its spirit. To determine whether the new iPhone is worth all the praises, we took two different models, one in Rose Gold and one in black, to see what they’re up to. On September 7, Apple broke down the iPhone 7 unveiling into 10 different parts, and we’re going to do the same thing for our review. Read on to find out everything about the new iPhone 7 Plus, including things that nobody has talked about before in other reviews. iPhone 7 Plus dual cameras - notice the white antenna lines on the Rose Gold #1. The iPhone 7 Plus design If you've used the bigger iPhone 6 or 6s before, there's nothing to really be excited about when seeing the new iPhone 7 Plus. As suggested by the majority of the controversial rumors we've mentioned in the introduction, the iPhone 7 Plus looks pretty much the same as its predecessor, with very small changes that are unlikely to impress anyone. The design is largely the same and the new model even has the same dimensions - 158.2 x 77.9 x 7.3 mm (6.23 x 3.07 x 0.29 inches), but is a little bit lighter - 188 grams versus 192 grams on the 6s Plus. Visually, the only changes are taking place on the back, with the antenna lines now moved to the top and bottom edges of the phone. One very unexpected detail is that antenna lines are not painted in the same color as the phone, so although one of the models we tested was Rose Gold, the antenna lines were white. The Plus comes with a dual-camera system that might indeed bring technical improvements (we'll detail that a little bit later), but aesthetically, this approach looks odd, to say the least. The camera bump is meh and we would have rather preferred a design similar to the Nexus 6P where the entire top edge that includes the camera is protruding. Because of the uninspired camera design, the iPhone 7 Plus looks awkward when sitting on the desk and it's impossible to use it with one hand on a flat surface. One little detail that very few seem to observe is that the iPhone logo on the back of the phone is now written with a bold font, which helps it stand out quite easily. The same approach is used on the iPhone box, which has also received several tweaks, including a bold font for the iPhone logo. All in all, there's very little to be excited about when looking at the iPhone 7 Plus and, at first glance, you can hardly find a reason to upgrade from an iPhone 6s Plus. But it's not all about the looks. iPhone 7 Plus front view - almost no changes as compared to 6s series #2. The upgraded hardware Since it's a new generation, it makes sense for the iPhone 7 to come with upgraded hardware, and the Plus model does not disappoint. Just as expected, the iPhone 7 Plus comes with the Apple A10 Fusion chip which, according to Cupertino itself, is not only more power efficient but also faster and more powerful. Specifically, the A9 processor available on the 6s plus was a dual-core chip clocked at 1.84 GHz, while on the 7 Plus, Apple went for a quad-core CPU running at 2.23 GHz. This is a worthy upgrade, but you won't notice such a big difference in real-life performance, as iOS 10 is super optimized on the iPhone 6s Plus too - a somewhat noticeable difference can be seen when browsing the web with Safari, as websites seem to load faster, but this could very well be a placebo effect. Apple has also upgraded the amount of RAM available on the Plus from 2GB to 3GB, which is pretty much a mandatory move given the fact that the new model comes with a dual-camera system and it needs more power to process photos. “Just as fast as the 6s Plus.” There are new storage versions, and while the iPhone 6s Plus was previously available with 16, 64, and 128 GB of storage space, the new version comes with 32, 128, and 256 GB. Obviously, there's no microSD card option. The 5.5-inch display is pretty much the same with the one installed on the 6s Plus, with one big difference: it features wide-color gamut support, which leads to better contrast and perfectly balanced brightness levels. In a market where everyone is moving to AMOLED, Apple seems to continuously find new ways to maximize the potential of LCD screens, and we really don't exaggerate when saying that the iPhone 7 Plus has the best iPhone display ever. Apple has also replaced the Home button with a touch-sensitive one and there are three pre-defined vibration intensity levels that can be configured in iOS 10. The change was necessary for more effective waterproofing, but also to pave the road for what's believed to be a complete makeover of the iPhone next year when all front-facing parts would be integrated into the display. While there's no headphone jack, the iPhone 7 Plus comes with stereo speakers, but you won't feel such a big difference and the new model is just as loud as its predecessor. You can read more about this in the dedicated section below. #3. The dual cameras The cameras are without a doubt the most important upgrade, especially when talking about the Plus version of the new iPhone lineup. While aesthetically the dual-camera system looks odd on the iPhone 7 Plus, it does serve its purpose well, even though there are still things to be improved here. But let's take everything one at a time to discuss it. iPhone 7 Plus camera sample, wallpaper quality photo without any edits First and foremost, the specs. The iPhone 6s Plus came with a single-lens 12-megapixel camera with F2.2, 1/3" sensor size, and 1.2 um pixel size. The 7 Plus has been upgraded to two different cameras, with the following specs: the wide-angle camera has F1.8 aperture, while the telephoto lens is F2.8, but offers instead an optical zoom of 2x. The iPhone 7 Plus is thus one of the first smartphones to offer optical zoom, and although it's just 2x for the time being (10x digital zoom is also offered), this is just the beginning of what could be mobile revolution. iPhone 7 Plus dual camera on the Rose Gold version For the moment, however, we've found us rarely using the telephoto lens, and most of the photos were shot with the main sensor that's also available on the smaller 4.7-inch iPhone. So if you don't mind not taking pics with the telephoto lens, you should be OK with the small iPhone too. iPhone 7 Plus camera sample with improved performance for detail shots The aperture upgrade on the iPhone 7 Plus makes it possible for the new model to shoot better pictures in low light, and this is clearly the biggest upgrade on the new generation. The iPhone 7 Plus finally sees in the dark and offers performance similar to the Samsung Galaxy S7/Note 7 series. The photos below compare the low-light performance of the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus - notice that the latter also manages to adjust brightness in a very effective manner, although we've noticed that, sometimes, the amount of red isn't properly handled, while the Samsung model uses more yellow. The quad-LED True Tone flash also helps compensate for distorted colors in low-light, but it's better not to use it at all if you want photos to look more natural. iPhone 7 Plus (left) and Samsung Galaxy Note 7 (right) low-light shot In perfect light conditions, both models shoot stunning photos and the iPhone 7 Plus certainly does not disappoint. The telephoto lens also takes awesome pics when the light is just the right one, but other than that, there's often too much noise, and sharpness seems to be missing entirely. Software processing continues to be an important part of Apple's photo shooting equation, and this is clearly no surprise. Most of the photos receive several finishing touches, such as automatically adjusted contrast and brightness, and in most of the cases, the result is above the average. “Better camera, but there's still room for improvements.” The iPhone 7 Plus also comes with a Portrait mode, currently available in beta versions of iOS 10, which adds a blur effect around the subject for more high-quality shots. More improvements are needed here as well, though, because the amount of blur that it uses is too high and, in some cases, this effect covers the margins of the subject. iPhone 7 Plus Portrait mode, sometimes with blur incorrectly applied The Samsung Galaxy Note 7 integrates a dedicated portrait mode as well, but in this case, options are far more advanced and Apple should really have this in mind for future improvements. The Note 7 lets users take one portrait shot and then decide where to put the focus, either in front or in the background, thus adjusting the position of the blur effect too. Macro shot: iPhone 7 Plus (left) vs. Samsung Galaxy Note 7 (right) OIS is obviously available, now on the smaller iPhone as well, and so is exposure control and auto HDR. Apple claims that the iPhone uses Sapphire crystal lens cover, but scratch tests have shown that it's actually regular glass that's more or less prone to damage. Overall, the iPhone 7 Plus shoots the best photos ever in the iPhone lineup, but it's still a little behind Samsung's flagship devices. At the moment, the S7/Note 7 offer the best camera in the smartphone business, but the iPhone 7 Plus certainly isn't far behind. #4. No headphone jack Definitely the most controversial change in the iPhone 7 lineup, the removal of the headphone jack turned the new model into a highly criticized device that's nearly impossible to use for listening to music while charging. But again, let's take everything one at a time to see what this is all about. So Apple decided to remove the headphone jack, and the company claimed it did it for 3 different reasons: the 3.5mm audio port is analog whereas the Lightning port is digital, and it not ony recharges the headphones but also allows you to control music without touching the phone; the need for space inside the phone; and the struggle for getting everything wireless. To compensate for the removal of the headphone jack, Apple is offering a Lightning set of headphones inside the box, as well as an adapter that converts the traditional analog port to Lightning. And yet, not having a headphone jack is super inconvenient. Just the other day when I was driving and using Waze for GPS navigation, I realized that talking on the phone behind the wheel is a nightmare. Using a traditional jack headphone set is no longer possible, and given the fact that the phone was connected to the car charger, the Lightning headphones that Apple included in the box could not be used. In this case, a Bluetooth headset was the only way to go, but it obviously costs extra. And because I didn't have one around, I had no other option than to reject the call. Just because I have an iPhone 7. iPhone 7 Plus Lightning port and no headphone jack... goodbye, old friend! #5. Waterproofing Apple has always been considered the most innovative company in the world, while all the others were followers that adopted its ideas in one form or another. But with the iPhone 7, things are a little bit different, as Apple is now doing the same thing Samsung did earlier this year: waterproofing its phones. Both iPhone 7 models are IP67 rated, which means that they offer the maximum protection when it comes to liquids and almost the maximum protection against dust. IP stands for Ingress Protection and the 67 rating shows that the iPhone 7 can survive being submerged for 30 minutes in water with a depth of 1 meter. The Samsung Galaxy S7 and the Note 7 are both rated IP68, but the difference only concerns dust protection, so in terms of waterproofing, they all offer the same level of protection. “Water resistant, but you'd better stay away from liquids!” And even though the iPhone 7 is officially water-resistant, you shouldn't expose it to liquids by any means. Apple clearly states that warranty doesn't cover liquid damage unless you have a premium package, so the company doesn't take any risk with it (for what it's worth, Samsung is doing the same thing for the S7 and Note 7 lineup, so it's not just Apple). In order to waterproof the iPhone, Apple used lots of glue and the iFixIt teardown has shown that the company indeed made some changes that were specifically implemented to keep water away from internal parts. For instance, the SIM tray now has some rubber around its external edges to prevent water from slipping in, while the removal of the physical Home button had the same purpose. In the end, the iPhone 7 shouldn't be taken into the shower, but water resistance is the kind of feature that's welcome just because it's there. It can prevent damages occurring after small accidents, and it's no longer a huge risk to use it during light rain. #6. iOS 10 iOS 10 is the new version of Apple's mobile operating system, and it brings several improvements, including new 3D Touch features, widgets, and redesigned notifications. In terms of exclusive iPhone 7 features, there's not much to be excited about, so in case you've previously used iOS 10 on any other iPhone, it's almost the same boring experience. The only difference is that you get some extra options to configure the vibration feedback of the Home button - with three different levels - as well as a new Portrait mode for photos, which is only available in beta for the moment, so only those who are participating in the program can give it a try. Other than that, there are small changes here and there, which are indeed nice and everyone would actually like them, but they remain exclusive to iPhone 7, so the operating system is 99 percent the same as on the iPhone 6s lineup. #7. Battery life Since it comes with a dual-camera system and other small upgrades, it makes sense for the new iPhone to feature a bigger battery too, especially because it needs more power to handle these hardware upgrades. And Apple delivered it, so the iPhone 7 Plus is upgraded from 2750 mAh on the predecessor to 2900 mAh. In terms of battery life, the iPhone 7 Plus provides almost the same performance as the older model, but with small differences depending on usage patterns. While providing accurate figures is quite difficult given that each buyer uses the phone in a different way, it's worth mentioning that the iPhone 7 Plus provides approximately 28 hours of battery life for the hardcore user and 36 hours with moderate usage. Charging takes just as much as before and you need approximately 100 minutes to fully recharge the iPhone. There's no fast charging mode and this is quite a drawback, considering that Samsung is already offering it on its flagship. Also, there's no wireless charging, but rumor has it Apple is working on it for the next generation. #8. The new colors The iPhone 7 Plus is available in five different colors: Rose Gold, Gold, Silver, Black, Jet Black. The two new colors are Black and Jet Black, but there's a catch. First and foremost, the Jet Black version is super glossy, and although it might look good, it's extremely prone to scratches. There's a big chance that after a few months of moderate use without a case, the Jet Black gets a more vintage look, despite the fact that it's designed to be ultra durable. What's important, however, is that the Jet Black has excellent grip. The Black version, on the other hand, doesn't provide the same level of grip, but it's not slippery either. It looks good on the iPhone 7 Plus and gives you the impression that it's smaller, even though we all know this is not the case. And once again, Apple has decided to keep the antenna lines on the iPhone 7 white/gray and not paint them in the same color as the rest of the phone. On the Rose Gold, the antenna lines don't seem to blend into the rest of the iPhone, and it doesn't make any sense. This affects the overall look of the iPhone, as the gray antenna lines help you realize how big the device actually is. iPhone 7 Plus rear shot for Black and Rose Gold versions #9. The stereo speakers One of the things that Apple claims it has improved on the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus is the audio quality of the speakers - and yes, it's the plural here because now there are two of them, as the new model is stereo. But when upgrading from the iPhone 6s Plus to the iPhone 7 Plus, the difference between the two is almost unnoticeable in terms of speaker performance. The audio quality of the new model is indeed a little higher, but otherwise, the iPhone 7 just as loud as its predecessor. If you're the type of person who uses the device to watch TV or talk on the phone on speaker while driving, there are big chances that you're going to want the iPhone to be louder, but for the moment, the stereo speakers just don't match our expectations. iPhone 7 Plus stereo and not so much, only small improvements actually noticeable #10. The little things that matter Apple has made some changes that might not be noticed at first glance, but they are certainly a nice touch to an otherwise dull upgrade for so many buyers. For example, Apple has also overhauled the iPhone 7 box. First of all, the face of the iPhone is no longer on the box, but the back, as Apple wants to make it clear that its new model comes with a dual-camera system - and this makes sense given the fact that there are almost no visual changes to the front side of the phone. Furthermore, the iPhone branding on the box now uses a bold font, and the same approach is used for the back of the phone too, thus making it a little bit more visible. “Oh, sweet soft vibrations...” When you open the box, the phone is no longer the first thing you see, but the user manual which clearly reads "Designed by Apple in California." The phone is just underneath it, probably in an attempt to prevent accidents when the iPhone dropped to the ground when opening the box. The iPhone picture on the box has the exact same size as the phone, so you can actually see how big the Plus is without opening the box. Another thing that's worth mentioning is that the SIM tray now uses sealing material for waterproofing and you'll see that when inserting the SIM for activation. There's also a small vibration when toggling between silent and ringer, as well as a secondary speaker grille that doesn't seem to do anything - we tried covering it and still no result in sound quality or level. The notification screen now vibrates when swiping it down, and this is another pleasant touch, and so does the Home button whenever you touch it. THE BOTTOM LINE We've heard lots of people calling the iPhone 7 Plus a dull phone that has nothing to offer over Samsung's flagship products, and many claimed this is the reason Apple's sales are collapsing. First of all, Apple's sales are not collapsing. The decline experienced this year wasn't a decline in iPhone sales, but a decline in iPhone's growth, so the company's flagship product keeps growing, only that it doesn't do it at the same pace anymore. Then, the iPhone 7 Plus can only be considered a dull release in terms of visual design, as the phone comes with several upgrades under the hood that make it a worthy investment. Even if you can't get over its looks, you have to try the iPhone 7 Plus, especially thanks to its camera. The dual-camera system might not be the most revolutionary technology launched so far, but the main lens offers an impressive upgrade over the 6s, so it's exactly what makes the iPhone 7 Plus special. This is what Apple has been aiming for and this is what it achieved. There are several other important upgrades, including waterproofing and the new Home button, which provides quite a premium feeling to the touch, but in the end, the iPhone 7 Plus seems to be more of a transition model whose sales might not be as big as the ones recorded by predecessors. But Apple has more or less accepted this because iPhone 7's role might be much more important than it seems: it paves the way for a bigger overhaul coming next year, so the new Home button and the removal of the headphone jack took place now in order to prepare the world for the 2017 iPhone, which will come with a plethora of upgrades, including a new design. Apple needed such a transition model to make sure that next year's iPhone is successful, so by implementing these controversial changes now, Cupertino has kind of accepted the risk of lower sales. In the end, the iPhone 7 Plus is a worthy upgrade if you can afford it, but other than that, you're not going to lose too much if you stick with the iPhone 6s Plus.   CHECK OUT THE GALLERY  (109 Images) #Apple#iPhone 7#iPhone 7 Plus#iPhone review#iPhone 7 review subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it iPhone 7 Plus (109 Images) 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 101 102 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news iPhone SE Review - Best Phone... of 2012 Apple iPhone 6s Review - The Original Sin Apple iPhone 6s Plus Review - The Special One iPhone 6 Plus Review – It’s Big Alright Three UK Hacked, Details of 6 Million Customers at Risk Microsoft Replaces Command Prompt with PowerShell in Latest Windows 10 Build Microsoft Can’t Kill Linux Right Now, The Linux Foundation Director Says iPhone 6 and 6 Plus “Touch Disease” Repairs Cost $149, Apple Says Hacker Breaks into Italian Government Website, 45,000 Users Exposed Samsung Galaxy J3 (2017) Leaks in Press Render NVIDIA Makes Available New GeForce Graphics Hotfix Driver - Version 375.95 Three UK Hacked, Details of 6 Million Customers at Risk 109 photos    iPhone 7 Plus rear view new ios apps NeuroNation: Train your brain to improve your memory and focus with NeuroNation Flipagram: Create cool videos by mixing up your photos with music Timer+: Set up dozens of timers and control them all with ease Nutshell Camera: Create some pretty cool videos with Nutshell Camera IKEA Catalogue: Check out the IKEA Catalogue for more than just furniture Complete: Complete puts a social twist to your regular to-do list/ task manager WebMD Baby: WebMD Baby offers help in how to best tend to your baby Reader comments Load old comments   iPhone 7 Review more on: Apple i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

The Stormfront store in the Kingsgate centre in Huddersfield was among the shops targeted by Paul Mumloong Chan. During a six-month spree Chan obtained 283 phones, Leeds Crown Court heard. Nick Adlington, prosecuting, said Apple had offered to replace phones if they were found to have a fault. Chan would take the counterfeit phones in which could not be powered up so the fault could not be checked on the premises. They would have to be sent away for examination and in the meantime Chan would be given a replacement of a genuine iPhone. Leeds Crown Court Chan used a number of false names during his visits to various outlets not just in Huddersfield but in Hull, Wakefield, Nottingham and Preston as well as the Apple stores in Manchester and Liverpool. When he was finally traced a “how to commit fraud guide” supplied to him by those behind the scam was found giving information on using false identities and advising him not to store the real phones at his home. Mr Adlington said Chan indicated initially that he did not believe he had done anything wrong. The loss to Apple was £124,000 but they indicated the case was part of a larger fraud against them involving at least 400 phones. Mohammed Nawaz, representing Chan, said the prosecution accepted from chat and text messages that another man had introduced him to the fraud. The court heard he is now believed to be in China. Read More A stolen Staffy, bottle throwers and grocery thieves: What crimes happened in Huddersfield this week He said Chan accepted he had played “an important and pivotal role but others were above him reaping the profits.” He had received £10 to £20 commission for each phone – around £5,000 – at a time when he found himself out of work and needed to support his family. He had now got a job as deputy manager at a café and was terrified at the thought of going to prison and the effect on his family. Chan, 36 of Woodstock Road, Moston, Manchester, admitted fraud and was jailed for two years. Judge Sally Cahill QC said: “This offence involved you going to retail premises where you took fraudulent iPhones and changed them for the real thing. You did so by claiming the phone was not working and took advantage of the exchange of phones by Apple.” She said the prosecution accepted others were involved “but you chose to involve yourself.” Read More Today's top stories Gallery@HD1 in trouble Man tried to choke busker Mill set to be knocked down £30k spent in ONE day at store Like us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter Daily Newsletter Follow @Examiner Subscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribe More On Apple Kingsgate Huddersfield news all Most Read Most Recent MelthamHow a kind stranger in Morrisons left Meltham mum weeping at the checkout A stranger has made a "substantial" donation to Meltham mum Anja Etty's fundraising efforts HuddersfieldWatch cars navigate HUGE puddle at Cooper Bridge as queues stretch back to M62 Minor flooding under railway bridge caused misery for rush hour commuters FacebookLive: Huddersfield breaking news, M62 and travel What's happening in Huddersfield today?

(AP File Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez)   Alex Webb Bloomberg     So far Apple's HealthKit has mostly collected fitness data from its devices. In the future, if the company gets its way, the software will interpret that information, turning it into advice for users, doctors and others. Scores of health-care experts hired by Apple in recent years are building improved electronic health record software that can better analyze and understand the implications of patient data, according to people familiar with the team's plans. The iPhone maker is also working on new apps for the Apple Watch. One helps users track sleep patterns, one of the people said. Another app gauges fitness levels by measuring the time taken for the heart rate to fall from its peak to resting level, according to one of the other people. Apple already has an app that measures heart rate, but doesn't interpret that data. The ultimate goal of Apple's medical technology team is to turn HealthKit into a tool that improves diagnoses, the people said. The system could chip away at two problems that plague the industry and have stumped other specialist firms in the field: interoperability -- allowing data to be transferred from hospital to hospital across different databases; and analysis -- making it quick and easy for physicians to extrapolate salient information from mountains of data. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook wants Apple to do more in software and services to secure new sources of revenue and make customers more dependent on the company's devices. The $8 trillion global health-care industry is a big opportunity. "If you drive for a while and your car gets too hot, it says pull over. If you need an oil change, it says check your oil. What's the equivalent for the body?" Cook said at a May conference in Amsterdam. "Health is a huge issue around the world and we think it's ripe for simplicity and a new view." An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment. Earlier this year, Apple bought Gliimpse Inc., a startup that built software to pull electronic health records from different databases and in different formats, then store them in one place. "I will be working on building a platform, a set of application program interfaces, and a simple product that will bring what we believe will be a disruptive consumer health-care application to the U.S. for the first time," Apple Health senior engineer Mohan Randhava wrote on his LinkedIn profile, which states he was employed at Gliimpse until February. He likened the product to Apple's music business. That started with the iPod, but as people became accustomed to storing all their music files digitally, Apple built a lucrative music platform on top of the device. Apple health software could become a revenue driver, too, by keeping people wedded to the company's devices. If a patient's health records, and related suggestions, are accessible through Apple's system, it would be harder to trade in an iPhone for a smartphone running Google's Android operating system, and its health-tracking software Google Fit. The second version of Apple's Watch has a faster processor, a built-in GPS tracker and is water resistant so people can run, swim and do other exercise with the device. The updated Watch software, dubbed watchOS 3, places health tracking information more prominently in the user interface, and adds a breathing exercise app as well as swim tracking. Building more sensors into the Watch serves a limited purpose. An accelerometer can generate most of the useful data needed to monitor a person's well-being, according to one person with knowledge of Apple's plans. A glucometer or blood-pressure sensor would only help a small percentage of users, the person said. Adding new medical sensors would also likely require approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, a much higher bar for Apple to cross. "If they are going to an FDA device, it would need to have enough battery life to last a day, and something where it independently functions from your phone," said Yuri Teshler, a health-care consultant at Moor Insights & Strategy. Apple can't really do anything more with health-related sensors until the watch has a wireless LTE chip and the independent cellular connection that comes with that, he added. Apple has so far struggled to do that. It's unclear how soon improvements to Apple's HealthKit may be introduced. ResearchKit, another Apple software, lets research institutions and drugmakers conduct clinical trials using iPhone apps, and some of the trials hint at possible future applications for HealthKit. Each clinical study using ResearchKit brings Apple a step closer to embedding itself in hospitals, labs and doctors' surgeries. North Carolina's Duke University developed a ResearchKit app using the iPhone's front-facing camera to conduct facial recognition checks which try to screen for and diagnose autism. Johns Hopkins University is using the Apple Watch's accelerometer and heart-rate sensor to track the onset and duration of seizures and try to predict them. In July, GlaxoSmithKline PLC became the first drugmaker to start a ResearchKit clinical study. "Apple is working hard with many of these large institutions to generate tools that are medically correct, to take data from sensors," said Scott Jenkins, CEO of health data management company Certainty Health LLC. "They want to be the repository, the open collection space." Stephen Friend, a Merck & Co. veteran who founded health data nonprofit Sage Bionetworks, is credited with being the brains behind ResearchKit. He joined Apple full-time in June having worked as a consultant for more than two years. Flipboard co-founder Evan Doll rejoined Apple in July as a director of health software engineering. Yoky Matsuoka, formerly technology chief at Google's Nest Labs unit, also joined Apple's health team last year. Nest is known mostly as a hardware specialist, but Matsuoka led the development of software that interpreted and learned from data that its internet-connected thermostats collect. She's using that machine-learning experience as she oversees a health-data team at Apple. Apple's greatest hurdle for now is proving to medical professionals that data delivered from wearables through HealthKit and ResearchKit is reliable. Brennan Spiegel, a gastroenterologist at Los Angeles' Cedars-Sinai Hospital, said clinical studies are crucial to making wearables useful. "It's wonderful to have advanced methods of aggregating and presenting data, but there's a risk of it becoming a garbage-in, garbage-out project," Spiegel said. "It doesn't matter how sophisticated the technical solution is. What matters is whether the data going into that solution are generating clinically valuable, actionable results that's improving human health in a way that's cost-effective." -- With assistance from Mark Gurman and Marie Mawad Article Comments (0) Tweet This article filed under: Business Technology Health & Fitness Bloomberg Comments () Guidelines: Keep it civil and on topic; no profanity, vulgarity, slurs or personal attacks.

Planning a vacation? Check out the best travel deals and destinations Opinion Keep smartphones safe from hackers? Go old school Apple unveils iPhone 7 Apple Inc has unveiled its new iPhone 7, with the widely expected removal of the analog headphone jack as well as a dual camera on some models and new wireless headphones called Air Pods. Apple Inc has unveiled its new iPhone 7, with the widely expected removal of the analog headphone jack as well as a dual camera on some models and new wireless headphones called Air Pods. Q&A: Learning to live with iPhone 7 As technology — not just pop culture, sports and politics — drives conversation, the latest iteration of Apple's iPhone stirred consumer passion earlier this month: Would wireless headphone technology be expensive and inconvenient? To put consumer fears and frustrations into perspective, as the pace of technological change unfolds, the Orlando Sentinel Editorial Board turned to Juan Gilbert of the University of Florida, the chairman of the department of computer and information sciences and engineering in the College of Engineering.  Juan Gilbert John Jernigan JJSS / Courtesy photo Juan Gilbert Juan Gilbert (John Jernigan JJSS / Courtesy photo) Q: Steve Jobs always maintained that Apple's job was to tell customers what they wanted, not the other way around. Is the iPhone 7 a continuation of that legacy? A: It's hard to say. The iPhone 7 is an extension of iPhone 6. One can argue that it's following that theme or you could argue that it's just the next step. Personally, I see it as the next step.   Q: Has the iPhone peaked in terms of how much Apple can improve new versions? Is this indicative of the market for smartphones in general? A: It has far from peaked. There's much more to come with mobile devices. Every time there's a release of a new phone, this question is asked, but there's still more to come. Stay tuned.   Customers check out the new Apple iPhone 7. Richard Vogel / AP Customers check out the new Apple iPhone 7. Customers check out the new Apple iPhone 7. (Richard Vogel / AP) Q: Does the move away from the headphone jack indicate that people really don't care about the quality of music any longer? Or will the quality be better with the new connection? A: Bluetooth has arrived. It's mature, and the quality is really good. I can't speak for Apple, but I doubt the reason for getting rid of the headphone jack was about people ignoring quality. It's most likely about the proliferation of Bluetooth and the quality it delivers. Going wireless was the next logical step.   Q: Beyond the iPhone specifically, can consumers who use smartphones ever be safe from hackers? A: Great question. Yes, you can be safe from hackers using a smartphone, but it depends on how far you want to go to protect your data and privacy. For example, you can disable location, never use the web browser, etc. and only use your smartphone as a phone. This is old school, but it would certainly protect you.   Q: Is it realistic to think consumers can keep our personal information away from data brokers? A: This is very challenging. I don't know if there's a good answer without federal government involvement. As long as it's acceptable to acquire this information, then this will happen. I heard a crazy statistic that if we read all of the privacy agreements we get on our phone, they would amount to some crazy number of days. So, I don't see a solution on the horizon anytime soon.   Q: Beyond consumer issues related to smartphones, you have championed efforts to increase the number of minorities in the computing disciplines. How do your efforts at the University of Florida compare with those nationally? A: There are approximately 150 black/African-American computing sciences doctoral students in the United States. The University of Florida has 17. We have the nation’s largest group of black/African-American computer-science doctoral students in the nation. We have a new doctorate degree in human-centered computing that is majority female, majority minority and majority U.S citizen. The UF cares about diversity. It’s important to our nation that we have full participation in computing from all members of our society, and we have done a very good job at increasing our diversity at the UF. Q: As young people consider careers in computing disciplines, what advice would you offer? A: Computing is everywhere and in just about everything. President Obama launched the CS4All initiative because The White House understands the impact computing has had and will continue to have on our society. I tell young people to strongly consider a career in computing and if they don’t pursue a career in computing, they need to be computer literate, at a minimum. Q: Science — especially technology — doesn’t get much mention in this year’s presidential campaign, except for hacking of campaigns. What specific issue would you like to see addressed? Can you make the case for it’s importance for national security? A: Definitely. I would like to ask the candidates: Do you support the CS4All initiative? How do you see computing as it relates to our economic future in the United States? Do you plan to support additional funding for computer-science research at the National Science Foundation and other agencies? With respect to national security, we hear about companies and the government being hacked. Many people believe the next war will be fought in cyberspace. If that’s the case, who are our soldiers? If we don’t build a domestic computing workforce, it will put our nation at a disadvantage economically and from a security point of view. It’s essential that we invest in computing to develop our own talent to ensure we have cybersoldiers (that’s my term) Privacy Policy Copyright © 2016, Orlando Sentinel Apple iPhone University of Florida Apple Inc.

While Apple’s ongoing struggles with VirnetX began in 2010, this latest retrial ruled that the company’s FaceTime platform used the latter’s patented internet security technology without gaining permission. Despite the argument that VirnetX could be considered little more than a patent troll, Apple has continually come up on the losing side in court. An initial ruling in 2012 ordered Apple to pay $368 million after using the patented virtual private networking tech in the iPhone 4S, but that was thrown out by the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in September 2015. Then a retrial was held in February of this year, combining two actions brought by VirnetX, and there a jury ruled that Apple needed to pay $625 million. But that ruling was voided as well, with a judge saying that the trial was unfair due to the jury being confused by repeated references to the previous case. Thus another retrial was ordered, bringing us to today. There’s no doubt that VirnetX intentionally brought its case against Apple to the East Texas Federal District Court, which is known to rule in favor of patent holders. In addition, Apple’s struggles with VirnetX are likely far from over, as they’ve recently filed a new suit over the use of security features in iOS’s iMessage app. SOURCE Reuters Story Timeline Apple to challenge the VirnetX Facetime patent infringment ruling VirnetX revives 2012 patent case against Apple, wants more monies Apple now owes VirnetX more than what Samsung owes it Apple won't need to pay VirnetX a single cent, for now Tags AppleBusinessFaceTimelawsuitlegalpatent Must Read Bits & Bytes Bucking trends, Acura reveals vision of tomorrow’s dashboard Now Alfa Romeo has an SUV, and we have so many questions 2017 Honda Civic Hatchback First Drive Jaguar I-PACE Concept previews Model X rivaling EV for 2018 MacBook Pro with Touch Bar Review (late-2016) Latest Headlines Ballu is part blimp and part robot Nov 18, 2016 Amazon Prime Video ready for global rollout soon Nov 18, 2016 SpaceX wants to launch 4,425 satellites for global internet connectivity Nov 18, 2016 Smaller Xiaomi Mi Mix packing 5.5-inch screen could be called Nano tips leak Nov 18, 2016 Scientists say asteroid strike that killed dinosaurs made a crater higher than Mt.

The man can be seen in multiple videos smashing up iPhones and a MacBook one after another with what seems to be a metal ball. The angry patron began his rampage by calmly laying down iPhones flat on the table and then destroying them with a heavy steel ball which 9to5Mac says is utilized in the French game Boules. He demolished at least 10 iPhones in such a manner before directing his attention to one MacBook Air. The disgruntled man interspersed his destruction with angry rants about his consumer rights. According to some publications, he’s accusing Apple of refusing to honor EU requirements to guarantee a two-year warranty for all goods. Thankfully, he reserved all his frustrations for the products and not any humans hanging around in the store based on the fact that there aren’t any reports of injuries. Also Read: Thief dressed as Apple employee walks off with $16000 in iPhones The irate protestor was later apprehended by mall security and prevented from re-entering the Apple Store by the outlet’s employees. He didn’t stay put though, attempting to make a run for it. He was caught immediately and made to wait for the police. Apple probably won’t take this lying down, which means the man’s actions could cost him thousands of dollars. Smashing iPhones to smithereens is an expensive business and the chances of the company going to court to recover the damages are very likely.

The battle between the two companies has been going on for some time, with a jury previously ruling that Apple owed more than $600 million to the "non-practicing entity" VirnetX. As Reuters reports, the new trial in Tyler, Texas was ordered by judge Robert Schroeder, who threw out VirnetX's previous $625.6 million win over Apple due to the jury being 'confused'. Related: iPhone 7 The latest retrial involved the jury determining damages on two VirnetX patents Apple had been found to infringe, as well as determining infringement and damages on a further two patents. A report from Bloomberg states "the ultimate decision will lie with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, which specializes in patent law." In other words, the whole thing is far from over, with Apple undoubtedly looking into appealing the latest decision. What's more, Reuters reports Nevada-based VirnetX is also suing Apple over further security features and its iMessage platform. The original case with VirnetX began in 2010, with the patent licensor being awarded $368 million in 2012, before that decision was thrown out in 2014. VinetX's lawyers then purued Apple with a second suit, which resulted in the larger $625.6 million verdict – one of the highest amounts ever for a U.S. patent case, before it too was thrown out prior to this latest trial.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « A Disgruntled Apple Customer Exacts his Revenge by Smashing 16 iPhones and a MacBook (Extended Video) | Main | Apple's iOS 10 Adoption Rate hits 55% in the U.S. in just Weeks » October 01, 2016 VirnetX won another round against Apple in their Never Ending Patent Infringement Case over FaceTime Technology   Apple has been fighting VirnetX since 2010. Apple lost their first case to VirnetX back in 2012. Just as that lawsuit ended, VirnetX was back in court the very same day filing yet another patent infringement case against Apple. Apple then appealed in 2014 and VirnetX appealed again and won. Apple filed a motion for a mistrial in February of this year. Then in May we reported that VirnetX had filed an injunction to force Apple to shut down patent infringing FaceTime and iMessage. In August VirnetX's stock plunged when a Judge voided the $625 million verdict against Apple. Apple was on a roll by getting UPSTO to invalidate 4 VirnetX Patents complicating their September 26 trial. But in the end, it's being reported by Reuters that Apple lost the case on Friday being ordered to pay VirnetX $302 million in damages for using their technology in FaceTime without permission.   The next step in this case is VirnetX will be back in court with Apple over willful infringement which could double Friday's verdict.   Without a doubt Apple will appeal once again, especially because the majority of the patents have been invalidated by the U.S. Patent Office. That process of invalidation will take years to iron out for a final verdict.   Cases this complicated shouldn't be tried by the Tyler Texas patent troll happy court. For this case to ever end correctly it has to go before a higher court and hopefully before judges specializing in patent infringement law.   With that said, Friday's verdict is just another round in what appears to be a case that will drag on for over a decade before it's finally concluded. So stay tuned, there a lot more to come.   About Making Comments on this Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit comments.

He smashed at least 13 iPhones in retaliation. (Image: REUTERS) What can you do if you ask for a refund at a store because you were not happy with something? In most cases, you simply walk out. But an angry Frenchman, who appeared cool, chose to differ. He walked out only after smashing at least 13 iPhones (iPhone 6s or iPhone 7) along with a MacBook with a petanque ball. What is a petanque ball? Never mind. A video shot by another customer (@Quentin_IOS) at an Apple Store in Dijon, France shows the raw power of consumers, especially angry ones. While the video went viral on the internet, details on why exactly did the man become violent is still unclear. However, the man appeared clearly prepared in the video to take on Apple. He was careful enough to wear gloves to protect his fingers from broken pieces of iPhones and also to get a better grip. The voices in the video revealed that the angry man was refused a refund for some product at the Apple Store. The man was heard in the video saying: "Ladies and gentlemen…Apple is ..company that violated European consumer’s rights.” “They refused to reimburse me. I told them Give me my money back. They said no.” “So you know what's happening?” “This is happening.” And BAM! He smashed another iPhone with the weapon of his choice.

According to a Reuters report filed late on Friday, the verdict was handed down by a federal jury in Texas that has a reputation for awarding favorable verdicts to plaintiffs in cases involving patent infringement. The U.S. district judge presiding over the case, Robert Schroeder, previously threw out VirnetX's $625.6 million win over Apple from a previous trial because he said jurors in that case may have been confused. The case with Nevada-based patent licensor VirnetX originally began in 2010, with a jury eventually awarding the company $368 million in 2012, but that decision was thrown out in 2014 after the court decided there were problems with how the trial judge had instructed jurors on calculating damages. VirnetX continued to pursue Apple in relation to patents it believes the company infringed upon. The previous two suits were combined by the licensor's lawyers, and in February, a jury returned with an even bigger verdict, $625.6 million – one of the highest ever in a U.S. patent case. However, Schroeder later voided the result, saying that the repeated references to the earlier case could have confused jurors and were unfair to Apple. In the latest trial, reports Reuters, jurors were asked to determine damages on two VirnetX patents that Apple had already been found to infringe, and to determine both infringement and damages on another two patents. The final $302.4 million award was in line with what VirnetX had been demanding. Neither Apple nor VirnetX have commented on the latest case, although Cupertino will surely exhaust all avenues for appeals before accepting the result. In the meantime, it is facing another court proceeding over whether it willfully infinged the patents, which could lead to higher damages. Apple is also set to contend with the trial in a second lawsuit filed by VirnetX over newer versions of Apple security features, as well as its iMessage platform.

Rating: 12 Votes kdarling 7 weeks ago So is Apple guilty of infringement of patent rights or not ... this article just talks about getting the case dismissed on technicalities related to the judicial process. It was previous high awards that had been dismissed. This trial was about redoing those awards and adding some others. How do you seek permission for vague software patents that should never be awarded and for which there is no product to compare to? No need. The patent holders approached Apple and Apple refused. So then the patent holders sued. This is pretty common, as Apple has a policy of refusing license requests and taking them to court. This isn't just some patent troll case, SAIC was a huge part of this and has actual working government level products using the tech. Yes, and most of the VirnetX officers are the actual inventors of their core patents. They're not what most people consider patent trolls. Yeah, it is amazing how many patent cases are handled there. Plaintiffs like East Texas and Delaware courts because they are quick, have technical experience, and favor patent holders. In a similar way, Apple prefers northern California courts which favor home state companies and seemingly, their lawyers' style. Likewise, Motorola used to favor filing in their home state of Illinois. Rating: 10 Votes LordVic 7 weeks ago And for all those crying foul about patent trolls I do hope you realize that Apple is part of a large consortium of patent trolls. They are one of the founding members of "RockStar COnsortium" whose primary motivation is to purchase existing patents to use in either defense or litigation. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockstar_Consortium so lets get off the "Patent troll" high horse and look at this case with more factual, and objective lenses. A legal patent holder had a patent awarded. Apple used technologies that infringed on patent. When the patent holder came asking for a license deal, Apple told them to go away, but continued to use the technology. That company had to sue in order to protect their legal rights as a patent holder. Apple lost. At the end of the day, Apple could have avoided this by doing one of two things. Change the technologies they were using to not infringe, OR pay the license fee. INstead they chose to purposefully and willfully infringe on the patent, and forced VirnetX to sue them.

Apple loses patent case to VirnetX for FaceTime's video technology The iPhone maker is likely to face another round of court proceedings for this case. By Agamoni Ghosh October 1, 2016 09:27 BST Apple has been found guilty of infringing a patent related to using VirnetX's security technologyReuters Apple has been ordered to pay more than $302m (£233) for infringing patents belonging to VirnetX Holding Corp. The iPhone maker has been found guilty of using VirnetX's internet security technology in features like FaceTime. The verdict is a let-down for Apple for a case that has been going on since 2010. At first the jury ruled that Apple owed more than $600m to VirnetX, but in August 2016 an appeals court threw the ruling out, saying jurors may have been confused. The latest verdict was handed out by the Eastern District of Texas court, which has gained a reputation for favouring plaintiffs that allege infringement in patent cases, reports say. Both Apple and VirnetX have not issued any statement post the order but Bloomberg reports that Apple is likely to face another round of court proceedings. The court will try to determine whether Apple wilfully infringed the patents and if found guilty, the company could face much higher damages. VirnetX has also filed another patent infringement case against Apple over other security features that include the iMessage application. VirnetX was founded by former employees of government contractor SAIC Inc, and most of its developed technology stems from work done for the CIA for developing secure communications. In fact, the company has been unsuccessful in marketing its own software and mostly relies on patent licensing for revenue. It has only about 20 employees, both part-time and full-time, and got its last payout from Microsoft Corp amounting to $23m.

The money relates to consultancy, legal fees and associated costs which have mounted up since the EU began its Apple state aid investigation three years ago. But Finance Minister Michael Noonan says he expects that legal costs will increase further, following Ireland’s decision to appeal the EU’ ruling that Apple owes Ireland €13bn in unpaid taxes. Details provided to Labour’s Joan Burton show the level of legal costs so far accumulated since the Competition Directorate of the European Commission first launched its probe into Apple. “Over the past three years approximately €1m has been spent in total. This includes all legal costs, consultancy fees and other associated costs. These have been paid by the Department of Finance, the Revenue Commissioners, the Attorney General’s Office and the Chief State Solicitor’s Office,” said Mr Noonan. The commission earlier this month announced that it had issued a negative decision in the Apple state aid case. The Government disagrees with the Commission’s analysis and is now challenging the decision before the European Courts. Mr Noonan, though, has said that an unknown amount of money will be provided for the legal challenge. “This is a legal process that could take several more years to conclude. It is therefore not possible to provide a comprehensive estimate of expected further expenses at this time. As it is an important issue for the State, the case will continue to be appropriately resourced,” he told Ms Burton in the written parliamentary reply. The Government say that the challenge is necessary to defend Ireland’s tax system and to provide certainty for businesses. There is also a belief at Government level that the ruling was an encroachment of EU state aid rules into member state taxation rules. Some opposition TDs argue Ireland has acted as a “tax haven” for companies.

By Mark Jones, Komando.com charnsitr / Shutterstock.com Apple launched the iPhone 7 models in early September. They're faster, shinier versions of their predecessors. A couple of major changes include the elimination of the headphone jack and the iPhone 7 Plus model has a spectacular dual-lens camera. Tim Cook even showed off some of the great photos taken with it. Well, can you believe that there are already rumors circulating about the iPhone 8? It's true! Because the 10th anniversary of the iPhone is in 2017, Apple is expected to pull out all of the stops to come up with its best smartphone ever. An anonymous employee at an Apple site in Israel where iPhone 8 hardware is being developed, has leaked details about the new gadget. The employee told "Business Insider" that the iPhone 8 will have a completely different look than previous models. Rumored iPhone 8 features Better camera - As usual, the next iPhone is said to come with a better camera than those on older models. Edge-to-edge OLED display - Interest in OLED screens is likely due to the fact that they are thinner than standard LED options, and can produce crisper colors. This makes them ideal for creating an enhanced user experience while allowing the manufacturers to continue producing thinner phone models. Curved edges - The iPhone 8 could be cased in curved glass that is made from liquid metal. No home button - Apple's 3D Touch technology along with a new TouchID scanner embedded under the screen could eliminate the need for the home button. Apple's normal schedule is to release a new model, and then an "S" version of that model the following year. Since 2017 is the 10th anniversary, it's expected to bypass the iPhone 7s and jump right to the iPhone 8. Keep checking back with our Happening Now section for more rumors and updates.

Eighty-five years later school children wear GPS watches and their parents are using their own wrist watches for so much more than simply telling time. What’s New? As technology catches up with fantasy, the latest and greatest gadgets, cellphones, rides and technology seem to fit naturally into a never-ending quest to power productivity, improve health, answer the need for speed, save time, stay safe, live healthy lives and have fun doing it. A majority of the “must have” gadgets are centered around improving already busy lives. Fortunately for everyone, there are plenty of new products to make life easier, safer and less stressful. “Technology is embedded into our every day experiences at a much faster rate than ever before,” said Krista Bourne, president, Verizon South Central Market. “We become reliant on the latest and greatest as soon as it hits the market. With so many options available, it’s easy to find something that fits your lifestyle.” Better Time Management The busier we are, the more we feel the need for tools and tricks that boost productivity and aid organization – and there are lots of options. The Apple Watch was the center of attention when it was released in April 2015. Now smart watches accompany smart phones, from Samsung to Moto. The age old wrist watch was declining in popularity as new generations looked to their phones to tell the time. However, with the advent of connected watches, the wrist accessory has made a comeback now that it allows wearers to track appointments, send and receive emails and text messages, consult their calendars and pay for lunch. The fashion component – size, color, style – isn’t lost on users, nor is the ability for parents of young children to track their offspring with the kid’s GizmoPal watch, complete with GPS and limited calling ability. Fitbit and other fitness bands have also soared in popularity and now offer watch options. Different bands have different functions, including GPS, step, mile and heart rate tracking, as well as tracking sleep habits. Sleep tracking functions allow users to track when they’re getting their best sleep. For Jaimesen Mapes, director of marketing, Town Square, that allows him to work in the evening, aware that his best sleep is after midnight, so he can be productive at night without sacrificing rest. “There’s a lot more technology out there, more than ever before, that allows you to spend more time doing what you want to do as opposed to what you have to do,” said Mapes. By way of example, Mapes uses the Apple Pen Tool to edit creative content, get proofs from advertising, make corrections, changes and additions directly to documents. “To me, that’s awesome. Not only better for the environment because I don’t have to print anything, but it frees up time I can use to do other things,” said Mapes. When time is of the essence, many executives have oft wished for the ability to be in two places simultaneously. Well, now they can. Apple’s Double 2 Telepresence Robot looks a bit like someone integrated Apple’s FaceTime with a Segway. “Imagine a business executive using that if they’re doing a lot of overseas stuff or long distance conferences, or having fun with their teams. It’s a way to have a presence at all meetings where they need to be,” said Greg Eroe, general manager, The Summit Reno. One time-saving trend that may be unique to Town Square is a salon for male grooming that offers a subscription service. For $49 a month, men can get as many haircuts and trims as they want, along with manicures and pedicures. No need to make an appointment that just has to be rescheduled if something comes up. Creative solutions such as these are part and parcel to the changing times and, while the concepts are sometimes simple, the execution is revolutionary. In many cases, consumers have proven to be willing to pay slightly higher fees for the convenience these new services can offer. Futuristic Home Security Technological “must haves” include innovations that can keep even the busiest life running on time, with organization and safety. New technology in smart homes, for example, can free people up to do more of what they want to do, rather than what they have to do, while providing the freedom to leave home knowing everything is safe and secure. For those who want to monitor school age children who are home alone, there are programs that connect with smart phones and allow users to view the house inside and out: check on the dog in the yard, the kids in the house and track deliveries coming to the front door. Trusted service providers can be given a temporary security code to enter and perform work, without the home owner needing to change all the security codes afterwards. Smart homes aren’t one size fits all. Technology now allows connectivity between devices so a smart phone can connect with a camera security system and features that control lighting, thermostats, door locks, window treatments. Active Outside of the Office In terms of items flying off the shelves of shops inside Town Square, there’s a trend toward fast fashion: people buying what they’ll wear to go out that night, and buying based on fit and feel rather than fashion and label. Another type of fast fashion seen at The Summit is a line of menswear button down shirts and dress slacks created from fabrics that allow them to double as yoga clothes. Imagine going to a business meeting in dress slacks and heading out immediately after to yoga class. For those heading out to ski, mountain bike or run, who want to record their athletic endeavors, the DJI Phantom 4 camera drone will record it all. Throw the drone up into the air and it will follow, creating a video – your own personal paparazzi that you can easily switch on or off. Other personal fitness items range from wireless blood pressure scanners to fitness apps, each designed to help users live healthier lives. KitchenAid is coming out with a line of blenders that rival the Vitamix for the health-conscious who want to mix healthy smoothies. For those heading out into nature, Orvis has come out with the Helios 2, a feather light fly fishing rod with the strength of an I-beam, a steel beam used in civil engineering and construction for their strength and stability. The Suunto Ambit GPS watches, another iteration of the fitness watch, include two models, one for tracking speed, pace, distance and elevation gain for runners, and another for sports like kayaking, mountain and road biking. What About the Flying Cars? When drones aren’t being flung into the air to follow athletics or busy delivering packages for Amazon, they may someday, in the not too distant future, be carrying humans. This past January, at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, a Chinese company called Ehang presented 184, a drone equipped with a pod capable of carrying a human. So far the range isn’t great – battery life lasts about 10 miles or 23 minutes – but the cool factor arises from the ability to use a smart phone and an app to program an autonomous aerial vehicle to transport a human. Tom Wilczek, Nevada Governor’s Office of Economic Development (GOED) industry specialist in aerospace and defense, spoke with the Ehang COO about eventually flying the 184 in the United States – and testing in Nevada. Ehang and GOED were able to execute an agreement in principle to work together through the Federal Aviation Administration’s (FAA) testing and licensing requirements. “The key parameter of the 184 is that you don’t have to be a pilot,” said Wilczek. Step into the comfortable, padded interior, plug in your iPad and the app comes up. GPS knows where you are – you provide your destination. “You don’t have to pilot [the drone].” Which is both good and bad in the FAA’s view. All of the technology already exists to operate the 184. It’s the licensing and regulatory concerns that will take time as the FAA looks at completely new modes of transportation. Human pilots have to be certified. Certification for technology is at least already being considered via the small unmanned aerial vehicles already testing in Nevada. Flying on Land So when can the general public take a ride in a drone? Not quite yet; the FAA still needs to test, license and regulate. But there are different ways of flying. Like keeping a vehicle on the ground, and going fast. New luxury cars are creating turbo engines that are more powerful, fuel efficient and have lower carbon emissions that are environmentally friendly, said Carolynn Towbin, chairman/dealer principal, Towbin Automotive. They’ve also got improved driver handling with updated electronics for traction, braking and anti-slip control. “And we’re talking about that because when mentioning features with high performance cars like Ferrari, what people are most interested in is increasing horsepower and under three second zero to 60 acceleration,” said Towbin. “These are people really interested in the performance of the car. They want to go 400 miles per hour.” So how does a driver stay safe in a high performance car capable of doing 200 miles per hour plus? Technology helps. All models of Ferrari come with Apple CarPlay, which connects the iPhone’s functions with the car’s built-in display to provide functionality without significant distraction. Ferrari is also integrating racing technology with street performance to produce a combination of electronic traction, handling, braking and safety features among the most advanced in the industry. That’s a good thing, considering the newest Ferrari model, the GTC4Lusso which features four-wheel drive, four-wheel steering and the capability of going 218 miles per hour. Don’t feel like doing the driving? Autonomous vehicles are being tested in Nevada and a newcomer to the scene, Faraday Future, broke ground on its Southern Nevada plant in April. A spokesperson for the company said principals see an incredible opportunity to deliver a new age of mobility driven solely by electric vehicles, with autonomous functionality, seamless connectivity and electric range being the key features driving demand for such vehicles. Faraday Future vehicles will be autonomous ready, electric vehicles with extreme technology capable of such things as alerting the driver before a trip to traffic issues and alternative routes, and determining preferences within the vehicle based on use. Make Time for Fun Aside from the productivity enhancements of technology wearables, the safety features provided by smart homes and the exciting changes to transportation, entertainment options are also getting an upgrade. While movies and shows aren’t disappearing anytime soon, new options for downtime are opening all the time. One of the newer offerings is Top Shot Las Vegas, a non-lethal simulated shooting experience for locals, tourists, executives and families – pretty much everybody. The facility is unique in that it’s more than a classic gun range, and users learn about gun safety and handle actual guns and assault rifles with specially made non-lethal rounds making the experience safe for even those new to weapon handling. Top Shot provides corporate team building opportunities and offers everything from simulated shooting with zombies to training for law enforcement. Parent company Ultimate Training Munitions or UTM, originally produced non-lethal ammunition for military training use, the most realistic training possible without live ammo. Military and law enforcement can use the technology to learn how to clear a room, go through a shoot out, address an active shooter or a robbery scenario, with a gun that operates like live fire with shell ejection, recoil and simulated noise. The projectile is safe – a laser – and results register on a screen. “We’ve found some of the major security people in Las Vegas come down and want to try it out,” said Fergus Connon, director, Top Shot Las Vegas. “They plan to use the facilities to train their personnel because it’s the closest reality can get to the real situation.” Another, possibly less intense range experience, depending on who you go with, is the newly open facility, Topgolf. “Topgolf is a driving range mixed with an elevated entertainment experience,” said Gilbert Medina, A/V manager. Where typical driving ranges are all about hitting a ball into the outfield, Topgolf features specific games and microchip-equipped golf balls that track how close players come to specific targets. In the signature game, players score by hitting microchipped balls into any target, and there’s more than one way to play. Team building and corporate events can reserve meeting rooms and golf bays. From fun to functionality today’s toys and technologies may be gadgets, cars or apps, but they share a sense of longing for “seamless connectivity” between health and fitness, safety and speed, productivity and fun and busy work and home lives.

But there is no need for Apple fans around the world to start panicking. No, iPhone 7s are not exploding just like the Note 7s and there is a very high chance that there will not be a recall on Apple's new smartphones. Photos of a iPhone 7 Plus that appears to have exploded were posted on Reddit this week, and have since fueled rumors that all iPhone 7s are about to meet the same fate as the Note 7 and burn up in flames. The Reddit user kroopthesnoop informed the community about the situation his co-worker found himself in when his iPhone 7 Plus arrived. The smartphone appeared to be "running a little hot" as the title of the post humorously suggests because photos reveal that the device appeared to overheat while out for shipping. In a series of photos shared, there is no denying something horrible happened to this iPhone 7 Plus before reaching the customer. The device packaging does looks crisp and black marks reveal it could have been burned. The damage was extensive enough to rip past the iPhone and the AT&T packaging, with dents and damage clearly being caused to the device itself. (Photo : kroopthesnoop ) The redditor claims the co-worker did not use the phone, and it came shipped this way. After making headlines, Apple reportedly reached out to the redditor to get more information about the incident. The company then called the customer and reportedly is working with AT&T to provide a replacement. Apple and AT&T have not publicly commented on the matter. Despite having photos to prove the iPhone 7 Plus was severely damaged, even if the cause of the explosion was overheating, this is most likely an isolated incident. It doesn't mean that all iPhone 7s are going to start exploding, too. And it's not like the smartphone blew up in flames when being charged or when in the customer's pocket. We can't blame the battery or make any assumptions as to how this one case of the iPhone 7 Plus exploded. It could be that maybe something happened while it was out for shipping to cause it to get this amount of damage. Still, the truth is that unfortunately sometimes phones explode. And iPhones are not exempt from this. For example, there have been cases the iPhone 6 exploding, with an Australian customer as recent as last month suffering from third-degree burns when it happened to him. While it's safe to assume the iPhone 7 Plus won't be recalled for exploding any time soon, one can never say never. It started with just one Samsung Note 7 explosion report. Then more and more incidents were reported, which then led to the mass recall. Apple did openly admit that the Jet Black iPhone 7 scratches easily, so if there were in fact a mass problem, customers could only hope the company would address it immediately. Until then, don't cancel your preorders as customers continue to wait for their Jet Black models. There is a good chance it will arrive combustion-free.   Source: Reddit TAG iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 7 Rumor, iPhone 7, Apple, AT&T, Smartphone, exploding iPhone, Exploding iPhone 7 Plus, Explosion © 2016 Tech Times, All rights reserved.

Any OLED supply agreement would depend on the Osaka-based company’s output capacity, said the person, who asked not to be identified because talks aren’t public. The discussions stem from Apple’s desire to increase the number of suppliers for OLED screens, according to the person. Earlier yesterday, Sharp announced it will invest ¥57.4 billion (US$566 million) for the development of OLED production facilities, with the goal of starting output by June 2018. The funds will be used for equipment in Sharp’s factories in Mie and Osaka, and to deliver sample products to customers, the company said in a statement. “Apple has unofficially or as a nod encouraged Sharp to go into it,” said Amir Anvarzadeh, Singapore-based head of Japanese equity sales at BGC Partners Inc., in a phone interview. “Apple’s general strategy is to increase the competition on the supply side, and dilute the risk exposure to one company.” Sharp spokesman Toyodo Uemura declined to comment on specific customers. An Apple spokesperson in Japan didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Sharp’s capital investment in OLED is part of ¥200 billion that the manufacturer had already committed to OLED technology, part of a strategic plan it adopted with new owner  Foxconn Technology Group. Next-generation screens based on OLED, or organic light-emitting diode, technology promise more vivid images and less battery drain. Yesterday’s announced investment will be for smartphone displays, a representative of Sharp said without identifying specific customers. “This investment is in response to what Apple is doing,” said Hideki Yasuda, an analyst at Ace Research Institute in Tokyo. “Production isn’t likely to begin until the second half of 2018, so the impact to profit won’t be until after that.” Sharp shares rose as much as 2.2 per cent after the announcement, but closed unchanged yesterday in Tokyo. The stock has climbed 8 per cent this year, compared with the broader market’s 15 per cent decline. Apple accounts for about 27 per cent of Sharp’s revenue, according to Bloomberg’s supply chain analysis. Earlier this year, the Japanese company agreed to accept a rescue package from Foxconn Technology Group, ending a takeover battle that spanned four years. Last month, the company said its liabilities no longer exceed assets after receiving a ¥289 billion infusion. — Bloomberg                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Facebook fake news writer on how he possibly influenced the US election Pushing the limits of science at the first Cyborg Olympics (VIDEO) Soar above the planet’s most spectacular sights with Google Earth VR (VIDEO) Udacity, an online learning startup, offers tech job trials How Twitter, Instagram and Facebook are stepping up measures to fight online abuse (VIDEO) Sony’s PS3 celebrates 10-year anniversary WhatsApp joins rivals from Snapchat to WeChat in video calls Facebook accidentally declares some users dead, including founder Zuckerberg Tinder launches transgender-inclusive update, allowing users to select personalised gender identity (VIDEO) Best smartphones for holiday 2016 Most Watched Now Week Neil Patrick Harris stars as Count Olaf in trailer for ‘A Series of Unfortunate Events’ ‘Fantastic Beasts’ of the TSA with James Corden, Eddie Redmayne Bloomberg Video: Resurrecting Jaguar’s legendary XKSS supercar Ah Beng reviews iguana’s epic escape from snakes (WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE) Did you know: The ocean is way deeper than you think Reuters Video: Thailand sinks boats to tackle illegal fishing Related Articles Singapore police: Bogus online ads offering S$1 iPhones Three iPhones may be coming next year, analyst claims Nintendo to release first iPhone Super Mario game Hong Kong jury views ‘torture’ video in Jutting murder trial British murder accused ‘filmed victims’ in Hong Kong Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2016 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

Minyanville 4 Best ETFs and Stocks to Tap the Tech Boom By Scutify Sep 30, 2016 9:32 am PRINT   Stay Connected This article is published in collaboration with Scutify, where you can find real-time markets and stock commentary from Robert Marcin, Cody Willard and others. Download the Scutify iOS App, the Scutify Android App or visit Scutify.com. After a lackluster first half of 2016, the technology sector is on fire in the third quarter on improving fundamentals, investors' drive for cheaper valuation and renewed focus on beaten down growth stocks. In fact, the sector led the market rally in Q3, with the ultra-popular Technology SPDR (XLK) gaining nearly 10.5% versus the gain of 3.4% for SPDR S&P 500 (SPY). Inside the Tech Surge Impressive growth of the sector largely hinges on Apple Inc.'s(AAPL) solid performance led by robust earnings and the iPhone 7 launch. The flurry of better-than-expected Q2 results from heavyweights such as Microsoft Corporation (MSFT), Alphabet Inc(GOOGL), Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN), and Facebook Inc (FB) also injected optimism, pushing the sector to new highs. Ongoing consolidation in the semiconductor industry and strong earnings reports from chipmakers Intel Corporation (INTC), Qualcomm, Inc. (QCOM), Texas Instruments Incorporated (TXN), and Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) added further strength (read:Catch Apple's Rally with These Top-Ranked Tech ETFs). In fact, the sector has staged a strong turnaround from the two previous quarters of negative earnings and even surpassed the S&P 500. The trend is likely to continue in the third quarter as the sector's earnings are expected to decline 1.9%, much lower than that of the S&P 500's decline of 3.1%, as per the Earnings Trend report. The expectation of outperformance in Q3 continues to fuel the rally in the sector. Additionally, a strengthening economy and better job prospects gave a nice boost to economically sensitive growth sectors like technology that typically perform well in a maturing economic cycle. As the world is becoming increasingly digital, demand for novel and advanced technologies such as cloud computing, big data, smartphones, high-speed fiber networks and the Internet of Things is growing by leaps and bounds. This is creating great opportunities for tech companies. And not to forget, most of these tech companies are sitting on a huge pile of cash and are in a position to increase payouts to their shareholders. 10 Growth Stocks That Will Outrun Google The cash reserves will ensure that these companies are not plagued by financial trouble even in a rising interest rate environment, the chance of which is looming large for later this year (read: Time to Buy These Tech ETFs?).

Irvin email print Sign Up for GamenGuide's Newsletter and never miss out on our most popular stories. iPad Pro is considered as a device that is close to a MacBook when it comes to performance. (Photo: Getty Images/Justin Sullivan) The upcoming iPad Pro 2 is rumored to be made available in three variants. The new Apple tablet is said to sports revolutionary specs and features, which include the A10 chipset, Apple Pencil, as well as AMOLED display panel. After a no-show at IFA 2016 in Germany, it is believed that the tablet might be released in March 2017 instead. According to HNGN,  the eventual 2017 release date was also hinted by Ming Chi-Kuo, who is a famous tech analyst. She stated that the Cupertino-based technology giant is very eager with regard to the integration of more impressive specs to the second installment of the iPad Pro unit. Rumors suggested that the three variants of the iPad Pro 2 will be composed of a different screen size, which include 12.9-inch, 10.5-inch, and 9.7-inch. More so, it is also stated that all variants are expected to be slimmer, water resistant, and lighter. According to Bloomberg, the new Apple tablet will also sport AMOLED display technology. Should the Ipad Pro 2 be made available next year, it is expected to come with the Apple pencil for more convenient and efficient writing and drawing. As stated in the same report, the pencil will help users to smoothly navigate through the unit with fluid panning, zooming, and scrolling features. Apart from that, it is also rumored that the table might be lacking a headphone jack and feature the Apple Airpods, which is the same with the recently launched iPhone 7 and 7 Plus units. Performance-wise, reports claim that both 12.9-inch and 10.50-inch variants will be powered by the latest A10X processor while the 9.7-inch will be equipped with an A9X chipset. Moreover, the basic variant of the iPad Pro 2 is rumored to have 32GB of internal storage option.

File picture: Damaris Helwig Johannesburg - On a moonscaped rise in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, thousands of men and women carve a heavy, off-white mineral away from the hillside with pickaxes, then wash it with shovels in man-made streams and haul it down the hill in 110-pound sacks. They are the sort of independent miners that big companies usually chase away when they get a minerals concession in Africa. Here, the workers instead are the face of a new collaboration that allows miners and company alike to profit - while proving to companies such as Apple and Samsung Electronics that what they mine doesn’t fund armed conflict. The face of this effort is Ben Mwangachuchu, a 56-year-old University of Notre Dame graduate who came home from Washington, D.C., to try to make it work in a country still torn by factional conflict. It’s a struggle as he copes with low prices and spates of smuggling, he says. But the system is slowly paying off and he’s beginning to reinvest profits in mechanisation that will help him improve efficiency and double revenue. “It was the only pragmatic way we could work in this post-conflict environment,” said Mwangachuchu, managing director of Societe Miniere de Bisunzu (SMB). On a hot day in late August, he stuck out in a checked blazer and sunglasses, joking easily with miners on the hill in their eclectic assortments of second-hand clothes. The prize is tantalum, a scarce mineral extracted from coltan ore that’s used in Apple’s iPhones and almost every other smartphone on the planet. Tantalum is a key component in precision technologies in aviation, automobile, armaments and electronics, including products made by companies including Samsung and Huawei Technologies. Three years ago, Mwangachuchu negotiated an agreement with a co-operative called Cooperamma that allows its diggers to mine parts of the site at Rubaya, northwest of the provincial capital of Goma. The condition: They only sell the mineral to SMB. That allows the company to track the mineral from mine to port, assuring that it’s untainted by conflict. At the time, when Mwangachuchu took over from his brother Edouard after he became a legislator and senator in Kinshasa, the capital, the mine was overrun with independent diggers. SMB could only access small parts of the concession area. Now, SMB finances as many as 5 000 miners when the price is high. Each month, the company pays Cooperamma as much as $5 million for coltan ore; the town at the foot of hill has swollen to 45 000 people. “Cohabitation between informal diggers and industrial mining companies is in everyone’s interest,” Robert Seninga, president of the Cooperamma co-operative, said by phone from Goma. “The agreement is bringing greater economic and physical security to the region.” Congo officially shipped 992 metric tons of coltan in 2015, down 25 percent from the previous year. More than 80 percent of that output came from Rubaya, Mwangachuchu reckons. The US Geological Survey puts the country’s share of global tantalum production at about 17 percent. If he could measure the resource, Mwangachuchu said, he’s convinced it would show the biggest deposit of the metal in Africa. It’s a far cry from the near-stoppage of coltan production in Congo in 2010, after the US Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act included a requirement for listed companies to disclose their use of four conflict minerals sourced from Congo and adjacent countries. The law was a response to a plethora of reports showing that rebel militias were profiting from coltan mines across Congo, including Rubaya. Mineral-tracing programmes slowly encouraged buyers to return. Rubaya was one of the first sites to be declared “conflict-free” by the Congolese government in 2012 and SMB’s coltan is now tagged under a system organised by the Frogmore, UK-based International Tin Research Institute. Apple, Huawei and Samsung all said either on their websites or through spokespeople that they and their suppliers only buy minerals mined ethically and in compliance with international guidelines prohibiting conflict minerals in the supply chain. Mwangachuchu’s biggest challenge now is maintaining liquidity in his cash-hungry business. When his buyers pay late, the system seizes up and diggers look to sell elsewhere. He would like a bridging facility, but says Congo’s banking sector hasn’t been helpful. The company is looking for investment to support mechanisation, including $1.5 million for a 1.2-megawatt hydro project to power the mine and the surrounding community. To date all investments have been funded by SMB cash. The coltan “is of an incredible quality and is extremely accessible”, Mwangachuchu said as he let a handful of the crumbly white ore fall through his fingers. “This is what has kept us alive.” But prices for coltan have been falling for more than a year, squeezing margins for SMB and Cooperamma and encouraging smuggling as diggers seek better prices on the black market. Tantalum prices have fallen about 54 percent since a peak monthly average of $126.39 per pound in December 2012 to about $58.50 this year, according to Roskill Information Services. Both figures are well short of a record of $350 in the late 1990s. The co-operative model can improve working conditions for diggers, allow for gradual mechanisation and should be followed by other companies, said Greg Mthembu-Salter, a former member of the United Nations Group of Experts, who studied Rubaya with the group in 2010 and 2011. “A mine owner, a co-operative and diggers who were previously at war with each other are now working together,” he said. “That has to be good news. And there are opportunities under this arrangement for improving facilities for diggers, improving health and safety, semi-mechanisation and so on.” The challenges are many. SMB estimates it loses as much as 50 percent of its production to smuggling, despite the tagging process introduced by ITRI. Buyers in neighbouring Rwanda purchase as much as 75 tons a month directly from traders who take product from the diggers at Rubaya and tag it as mineral from other sites in either Congo or Rwanda, Mwangachuchu said, over lunch of chicken, rice and stewed beans at SMB’s hilltop headquarters. The co-operative says smuggling only increases if SMB can’t keep up payments for diggers’ production. “Once there is a delay of two or three months without paying and other buyers are ready to inject cash behind our backs, it is difficult to control,” Seninga said. Mwangachuchu says he hopes further mechanisation of his mine will make it easier to regulate output and reduce smuggling. SMB already produces about 15 tons a month industrially and plans to excavate and expand a second part of the mine. Industrially mined coltan will then be crushed and washed in a processing facility that will increase mineral capture by 50 percent and could also treat the diggers’ production, according to SMB. Seninga is less convinced by mechanisation and says informal digging is more profitable at Rubaya than industrial mining. However, the cooperative is preparing for the future by investing in farming and commercial activities that can provide opportunities for diggers if work at SMB ends. “We know the resource will not last forever,” Seninga said. * With assistance from Jungah Lee in Seoul, Alex Webb in San Francisco and Samuel Dodge in London BLOOMBERG Like us on Facebook Connect with us on LinkedIn Hungry for more business news?

If not then it is essentially where you exploit bugs in Apple’s software to remove the restrictions imposed on your device by the operating system itself. It can be a scary prospect for users who don’t know precisely what they are doing. But what if you could spend a few dollars more to get one that has already been jailbroken for you? That’s precisely what an enterprising Japanese man thought. A recent report from Toyama, a city in the central part of Japan, says that a 24-year-old man named Daisuke Ikeda was recently arrested for selling five pre-jailbroken iPhones online. These apparently also included a copy of game called Monster Strike which is popular in the nation. According to the Japan Times, Ikeda had sold 200 iPhones before his arrest, “raking in an estimated ¥5,000,000 [about $50k] in sales”. This has mostly been a grey area, and many people jailbreak their own phones, though probably not for selling them. It’s going to raise some interesting legal questions.

The Phoneys sticker pack app hit the #1 Top Paid spot in the iMessage App Store in no time. Despite its success, it is being threatened to be pulled out because it apparently violates Apple trademarks and that the App Store does not accept prank apps. Though technically, Phoneys is not a prank app. It’s actually a sticker pack that look like iMessage bubbles; you know, the ones that appear on your chat with another friend. The thing about the app though is that it replaces your friends’ messages with some alternative text that were prepared by the app. So for example, if your friend typed in something like “Hey dummy!”, you can replace this with a sticker like “You’re so smart!” and confuse him afterwards. The app quickly gained popularity and soon enough, it reached the iMessage App Store’s #1 spot. Apple also took notice of the app and got in touch with the app developer, Adam Howell. According to Howell, a representative spoke with him on regards with how Phoneys app violates Apple’s trademarks and that it could no longer be marketed as a prank app. This was because Phoneys made use of the green and blue bubbles typically used on iMessage as well as its San Francisco font. In its place, Apple wanted the developer to make the bubbles look more like comic book cartoon bubbles. For its part, Apple promised that they were not pulling the app right away. They promised to give Howell a week to change the bubbles so that they no longer resemble the trademarked iMessage bubbles. The big concern here now is whether or not Phoneys should comply with the changes, thus altogether abandoning the very nature of the app. By making the bubbles look more like comic book cartoon bubbles and less like iMessage’s signature message, Phoneys loses its value. After all, the main purpose of using the Phoneys bubbles was to make your friends think they were the ones who sent the message. Furthermore, was Apple too lenient on its App Review process that it did not even bother to check out the app until it gained popularity? Currently, Phoneys continues to be on the #1 Top Paid app spot in the iMessage App Store but may be pulled in a few days. As for the app developer and the fate of his app, there’s still no clear decision on whether or not Howell plans to comply with Apple’s requests or ultimately remove the app.   Tags: App Store, Apple,

By John Gruber Archive The Talk Show Projects Contact Colophon RSS Feed Twitter Sponsorship BlackBerry vs. iPhone Friday, 9 May 2008 1: Wherein Neither ‘RIM’ Nor ‘BlackBerry’ Are Even Mentioned, but Rather the Stage Is Set for Showing Why They Might Be Seriously Screwed Along the lines of can’t-really-be-answered-but-gosh-they’re-fun-to-ponder questions like, say, “Who’d win in a fight, Batman or Spider-Man?” or “Star Destroyer vs. U.S.S. Enterprise?”,1 here’s one regarding the iPhone: What historical Mac is a current iPhone most analogous to, spec-wise? I.e, complete this sentence: “An iPhone is like having a tiny ____ in your pocket?” Now of course the comparison can’t be precise. Different software, different use cases, different purposes. But there’s no denying that an iPhone is a computer. And unless you’re really young, it’s faster — a lot faster — than the computers you owned not so long ago. So, seriously, stop here for a moment and think about it. My first answer, pulled simply from recollection of how fast machines felt to use, was the original iMac. But that machine — announced 10 years ago this week — had a 233 MHz G3 and, by default, a paltry 32 MB of RAM. Apple has never officially released the CPU specs of the iPhone, but Craig Hockenberry poked around with undocumented system APIs which indicated the iPhone’s CPU runs at 400 MHz with a bus speed of 100 MHz, and that there’s 128 MB of RAM. As we all recall from the PowerPC era, MHz is not a precise metric for comparing the performance of CPUs across different architectures; I wouldn’t be surprised in the least to find out that a 400 MHz PowerPC G3 is a faster chip than the 400 MHz ARMwhatever that’s in the iPhone, if only because of the power constraints. But, still, it’s something. So, my answer to the question: the original “Pismo” G3 PowerBook. The numbers match up pretty closely: 400 MHz CPU, 100 MHz bus speed, 64 MB of RAM. (The higher-end Pismo had a 500 MHz CPU and 128 MB of RAM.) Even storage sizes are similar: hard drive options for the Pismo were 6, 12, or 18 GB. Another possible answer: the original blue-and-white Power Mac G3 — again, 400 MHz CPU, 100 MHz bus speed, 64-128 MB of RAM, and 6-12 GB hard drives. Think about that — in just nine years, the specs that then described Apple’s top-of-the-line desktop computer now describe their phone. One thing that makes this comparison hard is that there’s not much software in common. You can’t use most of the real-world tasks commonly used for ballpark benchmarking, like, say, Photoshop image processing or ripping MP3s from AIFFs, because the iPhone doesn’t do them. But there is one processor intensive task we can compare: web page rendering. In the early days of the web, it took a while for even moderately large web pages to render in a browser, even when you were loading them from HTML files right on your hard drive. If you were to plop yourself down in front of one of these vintage 1999-2000 Macs for an afternoon of web browsing, even with a decent Ethernet connection to the Internet you’d find the experience pretty damn slow by current standards. For all the incessant chatter about the demand for and purported certainty of 3G wireless networking in the next generation of iPhone hardware, the truth is that current iPhones are held back, web-surfing-wise, by more than just the speed of EDGE (which admittedly, is indeed pretty slow). Recall this video pitting a 3G Nokia E61i against an iPhone on EDGE — total rendering time was more or less the same, and in a few cases, the iPhone came out ahead. You can see that browsing speed — which is what matters — depends on more than just networking speed simply by comparing how long it takes to render a web page on the iPhone using Wi-Fi: a lot longer than it takes to load the same page using Safari on a Mac. For example, it takes about two or three seconds for Safari to load the Daring Fireball home page on my new MacBook Pro. Using the same Wi-Fi network, it takes my iPhone about 15 seconds. (Using EDGE, it takes about 60 seconds to completely load, although you can start reading much sooner than that.) Point being that even if 3G wireless networking were as fast as Wi-Fi — which it’s not — browsing on an iPhone would still be pretty slow compared to browsing on a modern desktop or laptop. If you frequently use Wi-Fi on your iPhone, a faster processor in the next-generation hardware would make a bigger difference to the overall experience than faster phone-carrier networking. And so here’s the point I’m driving at. If a 2007 iPhone is loosely equivalent in terms of computing power to a 2000 PowerBook or 1999 Power Mac, that puts the spread at around seven or eight years. Extrapolate forward, and it’s therefore not at all unreasonable to think that a 2014 iPhone will pack the computing power of today’s MacBook Pro. Or, nearer term, that an iPhone introduced two years from now might pack the punch of a 2003 Aluminum PowerBook G4 — quite a difference from the Pismo. Even if your estimate of the iPhone’s equivalent-horsepower Mac is further back in time than mine, there’s no denying that Moore’s Law applies to handhelds, too. Eventually there will be a computer that fits in your pocket that is more powerful than today’s Mac Pros. But the path from here to there is riddled with difficult engineering problems — heat dissipation, battery life, and OS integration chief among them. There is marketing. There most certainly is design. But at the core of this market — by which I mean the market for handheld multitasking web-surfing networked-everywhere “phones” which are really computers — is engineering. Apple is the best handheld computer engineering company in the world today, hands down. They’re also the best handheld computer user experience design company. And they’re not sharing. 2: Why RIM Is Screwed When the iPhone was announced, I saw Apple as staking out ground far afield from the territory RIM occupies with the BlackBerry. Last year, I didn’t see Apple implementing Exchange support in the iPhone OS, and clearly that was, well, completely wrong. The “enterprise” features Apple has announced for the imminent 2.0 release of the iPhone OS — remote wipe, push email, automatic calendar and contact synching — pretty much encompass every single feature that’s been held up as a reason the iPhone wouldn’t sell to enterprise users. It remains to be seen how well these new iPhone features will actually work, but if the answer is “as well as promised”, and if the iPhone’s Mail app is improved in ways targeting people who receive a high number of messages, it’s hard to see a single software advantage in the BlackBerry’s favor. Which leaves hardware, which leaves the keyboard. Two Sundays ago, the New York Times ran a lengthy business-section piece by Brad Stone, titled “BlackBerry’s Quest: Fend Off the iPhone”. Regarding the upcoming BlackBerry 9000, the focus turned to the keyboard: Photographs of the device, leaked to gadget news sites, also indicate that the new BlackBerry will have elegant curves suggestive of the iPhone. It will also have a physical keyboard like previous R.I.M. devices, as opposed to the glass touch screen found on the iPhone. There’s a reason that R.I.M. is averse to the iPhone’s glass pad. “I couldn’t type on it and I still can’t type on it, and a lot of my friends can’t type on it,” says Mike Lazaridis, R.I.M.’s co-chief executive and technological visionary. “It’s hard to type on a piece of glass.” Mr. Lazaridis thinks that e-mail-dependent BlackBerry owners demand the reliability and tactile feedback of a keyboard. But, despite his critique of the iPhone, he does not dismiss the possibility that R.I.M. may itself one day sell a touch-screen phone, aimed specifically at consumers without the e-mail demands of BlackBerry’s core users. Translation: “We’ll emphasize the physical keyboard as a differentiating factor as long as it seems to work, at which point we’ll try a touch-screen keyboard too.” The only other angle RIM seems to be hanging its hat on is “security”: RIM is also betting on security, which hinges on the fact that its handsets and e-mail systems are relatively impervious to hackers. Mr. Lazaridis predicts that corporations will not give iPhones to their workers because they have already proved vulnerable to hackers eager to pry iPhones off AT&T’s system and make them work on other wireless networks. “It’s not that simple for an I.T. manager to give up security,” he said. The idea that iPhone carrier unlocking is a “security problem” is a conflation between what an attacker can do to your phone, against your will and/or unbeknownst to you, versus what a phone’s owner can do to their own phone. It’s not like these “hackers” are attacking happy AT&T-subscribed iPhone owners and switching them over to T-Mobile against their will. To understand why Apple is making a concerted effort to appeal to BlackBerry users, consider an analogy to the board game Risk. RIM has a large army (read: users), but they’re all massed together in one spot on the map. They care about email, they care about exactly the sort of enterprise features Apple has announced for the iPhone, and they are known to be willing to pay several hundred dollars for a handset. A lucrative target that can be attacked all at once. And the BlackBerry is weakest where the iPhone is strongest: web browsing, music, and video. Compare and contrast with, say, a software platform like Windows Mobile, or a hardware maker like Nokia — their users are spread across a wide variety of phones and platforms. It was far easier to turn the iPhone into something almost every BlackBerry customer might at least consider than it would have been to make a lineup of iPhones that appeal to every Nokia customer. RIM doesn’t really have any lock-in other than user habits. The BlackBerry gimmick is that it works with the email system your company bought from Microsoft. Replace a BlackBerry with an iPhone (2.0) and the messages, contacts, and calendar events that sync over the network will be the same as the ones on the BlackBerry you just tossed into a desk drawer. In broad terms, BlackBerrys are optimized first for email; the iPhone for the web. What’s more important, an email client or a web browser? For most people, and perhaps even most current BlackBerry users, the answer is clearly the web. Many people in fact read their email entirely through the web. Unless you’re Richard Stallman, you probably don’t read the web through your email client. The iPhone would be a credible, useful device with just two apps: Phone and Safari. But it doesn’t just have those two apps. It has a slew, and they’re all better on the iPhone than the BlackBerry and the difference with regard to anything other than email is only going to get more stark once the iTunes App Store opens its doors. If nothing else, consider games, games, and games. As I wrote when the iPhone’s upcoming enterprise features were announced, the iPhone can do more BlackBerry-ish things than the BlackBerry can do iPhone-ish things. Apple doesn’t wait for someone else to knock one of their hit products off its throne or slowly run it into the ground (cf. the Motorola Razr) — they do it themselves. For six years pundits have been declaring that competitors would “soon” catch up to the iPod, but the iPod has never been a static target — over the same six years Apple has released significant new iPods every year. There are no signs that RIM has the engineering chops on either side of the ball — hardware or software — to compete with where the iPhone is now, let alone where it’s going to be. We know that Apple has an OS that can scale to take advantage of faster (and multi-core) processors, because OS X is doing that already. If a two-years-away 2010 iPhone might be like having a 2003 PowerBook G4 in your pocket, for RIM’s sake a 2010 BlackBerry had better be something more than a BlackBerry with a brighter screen. Correct answers: Batman, Star Destroyer. ↩︎ Previous: Is This Microsoft-NBC ‘Copyright Cop’ Thing Bullshit or What?

We also know that while Apple’s attempt to control the ecosystem and maintain a closed platform may be good for Apple, developers want more options and customers want to fully access the overwhelming majority of web sites that use Flash. We think many customers are getting tired of being told what to think by Apple. And by the way, RIM has achieved record shipments for five consecutive quarters and recently shared guidance of 13.8 – 14.4 million BlackBerry smartphones for the current quarter. Apple’s preference to compare its September-ending quarter with RIM’s August-ending quarter doesn’t tell the whole story because it doesn’t take into account that industry demand in September is typically stronger than summer months, nor does it explain why Apple only shipped 8.4 million devices in its prior quarter and whether Apple’s Q4 results were padded by unfulfilled Q3 customer demand and channel orders. As usual, whether the subject is antennas, Flash or shipments, there is more to the story and sooner or later, even people inside the distortion field will begin to resent being told half a story. – Jim Balsillie, Co-CEO at Research In Motion (RIM) Share Read more about: blackberry playbook, tablet os Join the conversation Show comments Hide comments + - http://twitter.com/bbindiaforums BBIndia Forums Great reply.

Slaihing Wow. About time RIM responded. Steve insists on targeting BB even though RIM has the biggest market share. Real Deal If we are talking only smartphones here, RIM does not have the biggest market share – and it’s falling. Meanwhile Apple’s market share is climbing.

My husband works for RIM and all I can say is that they are kicking it in market share. We have the real numbers and the analysts out there don’t always give accurate info. Mario And so it is! Besides RIM makes huge business esp. here in Indonesia their biggest and fastest growing market right now (end of this year Indonesia has 150 million mobile phone users out of a population of 250 million). Here it’s all BB and Apple is nowhere in the numbers like RIM. Your not in business here without your BB and PIN… Doc only one major carrier has iPhone. All the major carriers have Blackberries why don’t you do the math instead of regurgitating what Apple tells you http://twitter.com/FoxRoxYourSox Greg Fox Actually Doc, iPhone is carried by AT&T, T-Mobile (Germany, UK, Netherlands), SoftBank, Orange, O2, Vodaphone, TELUS Mobility, Rogers and Bell Mobility. HardcoreMommy What do you mean only one carrier has iPhone? Even Walmart has iPhone … for 3 different carriers alone… are you serious?

Apple is good a marketing – this doesn’t mean they have the market share – and in fact, they don’t want the market share. They are getting plenty of profit off of the share they currently have. Bmbartels I read a transcript of what Steve said and just became disgusted. You killed it! This is why I will be a BlackBerry forever, y’all are good, honest people who make the best products. http://pulse.yahoo.com/_CLR3KAHSRGJUXLZD74TSIBFAHI reece Great. Now please demo a working Playbook unit. Don’t just hold it in your hand, but use it. Because right now, it looks like the Playbook is just vaporware. ShortChange If customers are tired of ‘being told by Apple’ …sales would reflect that? Come on Balsille, RIM needs to step up their game and you know it. Developers ‘may’ want to build on flash for your systems, and that’s because you have a terrible software platform which isn’t capable of making good applications. Your application offerings are slim pickings; a fraction of the quality and quantity of Apple’s. You are losing market share by the hour. Your products are severely outdated. If you can’t face reality, the board needs to replace you. Step up the game, or become a thing of the past. Hoho How about you realize that this post IS NOT ABOUT SMARTPHONES… its about tablets!!! http://twitter.com/HoracioRivera Horacio Rivera I now own a BB i8350 and sucks BIG TIME, nextel has made already 5 REPLACEMENTS and the freaking thing has one problem or other, it seem like finally they will finally cancel my contract and start a new one without smartphone involved. I prefer beeing stuck with wife’s 2G iPhone than to read a Facebook coment on my i8350, crap cominig out of a bull, thats what my BB is. Ben Why don’t you try dropping your iToy and I’ll drop my Blackberry, let’s see which survives. Oh and please remove that cute little bumper you had to buy to make the phone work properly. T1 Yep gotta get me that Fart app for my phone…yessirreee. pshh! What are you reading…Apple weekly? Some Apple pushing dork running down the latest BB release? You should pay a little more attention to where the articles come from….OR…heres an idea actually test drive the new BB’s! At least you’d be providing a fresh perspective instead of recycled drivel from years past – cause I’ve heard these exact comments before….funny its usually around the time a new BB product is scheduled for release…or is making news. Lovin’ my BBB! Dennycranium If my sales reflect anything- its that Rim is gaining ground. I sell smartphones throughout North America and my numbers show BB as the biggest seller. Feedback from my customers tell me they prefer the Rim product. I’ve had customers switch to apple or droid only to call me 3 months later asking to go back to Blackberry. Some people may feel that Rim needs a sexier or more “souped up” device in terms of processing but Rim understands the smartphone market. Its about creating a stream of revenue for them and for the carriers. Their sales results show this again and again. Anonymous Forbes should instate a new award category: Most Arrogant CEO of the decade. No points for guessing who the winner would be… http://twitter.com/wallner67 Phillip Wallner Steve Jobs? Michael Howie No need to be rude to Steve. http://twitter.com/ross_ritchey Ross Ritchey Obviously Steve Jobs. Hands down. No competition. http://twitter.com/rtorcato Richard Torcato Apple has the earnings to back it up. When will Rim stop doing the BOGO deals and show how many people actually want to buy their phones. dieter the response is lame… of course 7inches are far inferior to 9inches! especially when most of that real estate is clobbered up with flash commercials. you apple haters out there! try an ipad and you’d realize that life without flash is a blessing….i can’t wait to get rid of my bb and to receive mail on my ipad instead… Marcopolo Yeah bigger is not always better! Anonymous Looks like nobody cares what RIMM says! Only 4 response? Mr CEO, Let the ppl speak for your products. Also, I am not saying what SJ or Apple says is always correct but Apple is one of the top firms that profits through innovation and that is what matters in the end! What RIMM has done in the last few years that is innovative or ground breaking? The smoke and mirror tablet that was showcased some time back is nothing more that another Storm! Let’s see anyway!!! UrbanKhoja Whilst we all appreciate you taking the time to post, did you actually research first? You’re forgiven if you were simply too busy playing with your Lego and train set. Anyone old enough to go see a film without the need for an abundance of ID would know the benefits of both devices. Yes the iPhone is a great piece of technology, but it’s not perfect by any means. The BlackBerry isn’t perfect either, it’s based on a terribly outdated OS and lacks the build quality of Apple products. But all that aside, it’s evident the BlackBerry is a better device and thus easier to get things done. Which device caused big shenanigans in the middle east as the governments couldn’t intercept messages etc? Ergo which device will be one that will keep your data secure? The BlackBerry. It saddens me that Apple consumers don’t have the mental capacity to see beyond the Apple slogans and advertising, I feel RIM ought to set aside a charitable trust to help them recover and educate them in the ways of BlackBerry. Lastly, I would like to think that Her Magesty will duly see Mr Balsillie and reward him with some form of peerage for his comment above. Jim’ll fix it anyone? http://pulse.yahoo.com/_JIHUENU4IWPQHI7KHHISVRBJ2U Kimo Do you work for BB? If you do that is great, you’ll be the talk of the office for 5 minutes. If not, I believe your comments would certainly classify you as a “follower.” Hope you don’t live in a glass house because you are throwing stones. And, to degrade someone you do not know and try to masquerade your comments with gibberish in an “undergrad” manner unveils some input into your social character. Don’t get me wrong I believe you have the right to feel the way you do, just try not to sound academic then finish the document with “Jim’ll fix it.” And use words that are applicable please. No person would receive peerage over a comment and I believe her Majesty would be quite upset to be acknowledged by the wrong word. Also please look up the definition of shenanigans, it does not mean problems. I agree with the overall message, just not the way you represented the cause. http://digitaldaily.allthingsd.com/20101019/qotd-a-rim-shot-for-steve-jobs/ QOTD: A RIM Shot for Steve Jobs | John Paczkowski | Digital Daily | AllThingsD […] Jim Balsillie, co-CEO of Research In Motion, takes issue with Steve Jobs’s declaration that tablets with […] Gerry Daman Steve Jobs may have been a bit harsh, but until RIM actually ups their game to compete with real smartphones, people will continue to look elsewhere. Examples of disappointment from RIM in my eyes: 1. The Torch – the same screen from the disappointing Storm?! 2. The Playbook – no prices, no working demo, just specs on a sheet. Vaporware. Jackie Real devices were demoed at the Devcon in SFO last month. http://www.facebook.com/people/Dave-Thomson/663213839 Dave Thomson Oh really ? I must have missed the demo of the playbook then… Squeaky192 Exactly. There’s a reason Verizon gets a new Android device every 28 days and they fly off the shelves. http://twitter.com/wallner67 Phillip Wallner Errm, the same screen as the Storm? I’m pretty sure the Storm had that terrible “SurePress” screen, while the Torch has a capacitive multitouch screen. And just to clue you in, that’s how all devices start – as specs on a sheet. But you probably think Steve Jobs said “let there be iphone” and it magically appeared in his hand. Just because Apple doesn’t release any of their concepts before actually designing them doesn’t make them better (or worse). To the guy who made the point about new Android devices – could that possibly be because there are currently 25 companies who manufacture Android phones? RIM is in trouble, but don’t invent problems that aren’t there. Hayzus What are you talking about man? Same as Storm? Have you actually seen the phone? It’s not a big button anymore. And it’s a helluva lot faster than the iPhone. Edgard Yuo are right man, I am a BB user BB8100, BB8320, BB8900, BB8520, and now a BB9550. I was hoping that the next generation “Storm” will have a 1gzh processor and a Super Oled or Amodel Screen. I like BBs and how they help to stay organized and I love the multitask, ah yes the mail too. But now I thinking to triad an Adroid phone. Ah! the Playbook will be my first table, but I need to know, microsd slot?, capacity? price? (Please excuse my English is it is bad written, Edgard from Perú) Chris M The Torch doesn’t use the same screen as the Storm. Besides, if you’ve ever used a Storm 2 instead of just reading crap on the internet, you would know that its actually very good and easy to use. The Playbook isn’t vaporware just because people didn’t get to use it at the announcement. If that were the way it is, then the Torch would be vaporware too … Me The Torch has a COMPLETELY different screen than the Storm. The Torch has a capacitive screen with all the fingertip zooming, etc. that you expect. The Storm was a failed short sighted response to the iPhone – the Storm (and II) was simply a bad idea. The Torch may be the best cell phone available ATM. Logout Think different. I believe the meaning of that slogan changed. James RIM just please make a quality tablet that works, you even had the nerve to have a fake one on stage,http://www.singularityhacker.com/2010/09/blackberry-playbook-doesnt-exist.html Until then I’m not buying into the RIM “Distortion Field” that you know how to make an ideal tablet that just works. http://twitter.com/ross_ritchey Ross Ritchey The “just works” bull is part of the Apple distortion field, FYI. Apple computers haven’t just worked…. ever. They have some nice bells and whistles, but they don’t “just work” And the iPhone – doesn’t “just work” either. For the end user, the touch screen is unresponsive. For the developer, they are locked into a losing battle. For the network – they need to spend billions upgrading and still get flak for it. The only people the iPhone just works for is Apple and their Shareholders. rojo BOOM! I don’t own a blackberry device but this reply may change my mind. Mason Darren Blackberry is so far behind. All they have left is that corporate executive image they have fostered over the years, and those in need of their specific physical keyboard. Who wants to use or develop for a Blackberry browser? The OS will never catch up to Apple OR Android, all this is just damage control. Blackberry is old. Cl_ads Mason, why don’t you educate yourself and research which company has the largest business market…RIM or Apple? RIM owners aren’t generally the young, insecure types that need to buy the latest phone to be “in” and then to find out the product isn’t worth all the hype, and they are stuck with a poor product..I”m retired from telecommunications, I built the towers and sold the phones, and will take RIM everyday over Apple Mason Darren Then you are the perfect RIM customer…an antique. And sounding quite insecure at that. http://www.jeffgibbard.com/ JGibbard Your generalizations are fairly offensive. The fact that you are claiming that the iPhone is simply for young insecure people who need the latest phone is about as accurate as saying Blackberrys are only for old people that need a physical keyboard because they can’t comprehend a touch screen. The iPhone changed the entire paradigm of telecomm by disrupting the power that carries had in favor of the phone manufacturer. Before the iPhone “App Store” was gibberish. If you are so impressed about RIM’s business numbers in this debate, you are missing the point. Apple is shipping a ton of phones and has momentum. They are the 2nd most valuable company in the world. Their stock price is more than $250/per share higher. Thanks for building the towers. Elemento RIM owners aren’t generally the young, insecure types that need to buy the latest phone to be “in”… Did you guys ever wonder why RIM´s products launching never have the same hype Apple´s stuff do? Why we never see people waiting in line the whole night just to be the first one to buy the new iWhatever??? Easy one! It´s because BB users have to work, we have a life, we have families and “normal people´s” stuff like that! Hahaha! http://twitter.com/jr_plusplus Julian Russell Evidently RIM owners are the older, insecure types who don’t want to use their phone for anything except for e-mail. Chriskhall CI_ads, while, you make an excellent statement, I don’t think that your statement really counters what Mason said…what is it about Blackberry that is inherently better than IPhone and why do so many business users have them? I bought my own 9630 by the way…but I have so little ammunition when my friends pull out their Iphones and they are just so impressive… Catz1215 I agree with CI_ads. BB are not made to target the teen crowd but the business crowd and besides that, at least BB phones have longer battery times than those Android phones and I have both a BB and an Android. I prefer my BB for this bery reason and I can get apps on my BB just like on my Android without draining my battery in one hour. Jonas Right – a poor product with a larger screen, multi-touch, way better performance, 200k+ apps to choose from, a full-fledged modern browser and the best OS of the crop. Using Excel and Powerpoint all day long has really twisted your perception. Joji_vk Cl_ads, I love my Blackberry. But this is the age of Facebook and Twitter with 500million+ in a few years.(Did I say Yahoo is dead!! Or Google move aside). The customers with lot of cash to throw away and time to spend are the kiddos. Not the executives that work for companies that keep cutting costs (I have my same Blackberry for last 3 years). That is where Apple has hit Jackpot. That is why they could ship 14 million in a few years and it will keep rising where as Blackberry is almost at the same level for sometime. I remember reading Jim Balsillie saying that IPhone is just another new player in the crowded market. But now they are reached the same no of shipments as Blackberry. And RIM is slow to innovate. “Serve the masses and you will be with the classes” Vignesh CI_ads, Hi. I love Blackberry and have used all the models that they have ever released (except for the new slide one..!). Presently I use a BB 8520 and an Iphone. We can talk about the market share and how strong RIM is etc, but remember, BBs were in existence long before Iphone came to the market and Iphone marketshare is growing exponentially. RIM has to come up with more innovative solutions and better the browser experience. The quality and userfriendliness on an Iphone is absolutely amazing. Business users are more and more starting to move to Iphone, because once you experience the Iphone, there is really no looking back, be it rendering of images, speed and of course the apps. In my own circle of people, I have seen 4 diehard BB fans moving to Iphone. RIM has to be careful. Hopefully the Os 6 is better and may be more investment will go into enhancing the BB experience. Cheers. BerryMaster Behind? If you like to have devices with locks then go apple… who cares!!!! Guest You are clearly just a fan boy. Techie JP True words of a follower, you people are whats wrong with society in general, never strong enough to think for yourself and but always willing to follow blindly. I will always praise apple for their computers and most of their software, but never for their other products. I despise being locked in or not having full access to the things i buy, and while all manufacturers do it no one does it as severely as apple. Blackberry might be old but it has more experience and is the original smart-phone, if RIM is falling behind its because its giving people what they want and not what they see fit. me break away from the matrix sir… Edgard There are much more that just the web experience. I can work with mi BB but I consider the Iphone just for play music and videos, is really good for that. one ball jay Mason, you’re an idiot. Jenyc2020 Can’t beat blackberry’s real push e-mail.. I’ll take the old monocrome track wheel BB over iphone any day. And yes I had the Iphone for 1 year and was happy to get a simple do it all bb. http://ceejayoz.com/ ceejayoz iPhones have real push e-mail. Cook no. they actually don’t. http://ceejayoz.com/ ceejayoz What does it lack? Guest It doesn’t support IMAP IDLE, so it’s not true Push. http://ceejayoz.com/ ceejayoz I’ll adjust the question. What does it lack from an end-user’s perspective? http://ceejayoz.com/ ceejayoz What does it lack? Torsnow Lol, except you have to pay for a MobileMe account or use your GMail account to actually have access to push email. Neither is a better phone. One is better for a given user, another is better for another user. Why does everyone feel the need to cheer on their product manufacturer as if it was their sports team? Go habs go! http://twitter.com/kpoindexter Kevin Poindexter Jr You obviously don’t know RIMM’s market outside of the USA. Go to any other country and even the Youth of today have blackberry’s. Stop being so narrow minded and look beyond the scope of Apple and what they protray. T1 My son has had 2 iphones in the last year…yes 2. He has now switched to a BB like myself (2yrs running – no problems). The product is solid just like the company. The HYPE over iphone apps and android is just that HYPE. Really, how many dumb apps to you need on your phone…my BB Bold has apps for everything and its friggen solid unlikely the dainty iphones – that onscreen keybd is a joke nut hey if you like that sort of thing BB has the touch phone too. Kudos to Jim for telling it like it is.🙂 Richel Esguerra i strongly agree with you T1, iphone is just a toy for me. No wonder kids and young adolescent liked it so much. Every manufacturer always targets sales, apple will definitely smile cause back on their mind it pleased lot of young generation. If their target is to treat apple as a toy, so be it, it’s their marketing strategy. They should not compete with RIM’s blackberry cause their’s no way to compare with the true essense of smartphones. madcorgi Who wouldn’t want to develop for the Blackberry browser on the new devices? And the Playbook is going to kick but with both HTML5 and Flash support. Apple devices break easily. I have seen too many cracked iPhone screens and am kind of annoyed with Apple’s hurdles for the development community. And another win for Blackberry. I can actually type on my Storm2. Typing on the iPhone is incredibly annoying. Laudyemofio BB is far behind. Very true, but i only partially agree with you. BB needs to quit playing the catchup game and start being innovative. Bust some new moves people…lets achieve some uniqueness. for example BBM is a unique BB tool. Lets find something else for the average user to get excited about. With the OS, the lattest OS. 6 is actually encouraging and i hope RIM doesnt go back to sleep but rather keep pushing to surpass Andriod if possible. Saurabhhindu why we dont have dislike option here!!!!!!!!!!!! Eric M Smith I’m not sure what planet you are on, but it’s Apple that is NOW and will always be behind Blackberry. iPhones are for people who think Ketchup is the only condiment. No, it’s the only one CHILDREN will eat. People who go to work, go to work with Blackberry. Nick I only have one thing to say, You sir are clueless. And no I am not a blackberry fanboy infact I use Android phones which I would glady chuck into the bin along with any apple product, just because of empty promises by Apple and HTC alike. http://blackberrycool.com/ Matt Cameron Good reply Jim.

Ghostscript Wow! Steve Jobs just got slapped! LOL! davidavid Blackberry is a dated, dying platform. I think everyone understands that. Fwerner34 Your statement is borderline absurd. RIMM shipped 11.2 million BlackBerry smartphones during the May quarter. It also added 4.9 million subscribers during the same period, increasing the total subscriber base to 46 million. And the company estimates that it added some 5 million more subscribers in the August interim. So how can you say that “everyone understands” that Blackberry is a “dated, dying platform”? What everyone understands, however, is that you have no idea what you are talking about. Nattyranks All well and good Jim…But can you give us loyal Storm fans something we can be proud of???? Steven_perna Yes…we need a new and improved storm! I will stay with blackberry if you guys can get it right and get it going! Otherwise iphone for verizon here I come!! Laudyemofio Hey…am with u on that one. I think its absurd to say the least that we BB Storm customers hve been left out to dry. We purchased the storm even when it was being bashed from left right forwards and centre. Now u would thing the storm would have been the first to receive an OS.6 update. If RIM doesn’t do something about the Storm, i am definately gonna go Android cos i want nothing else but the Storm 2. I dont want the Torch cos i think the Storm2 with the same OS will be far better. Mitch There is a solution for Storm users. It’s called the iPhone. You should probably have taken a little bit more of all that”bash”-ing of the storm before you purchased. RIM has not been able to put together a solid OS in all of these years, so why does anyone expect that they are going to be able to create a decent touch screen experience? Please at least get a droid. “Loyalty” to a company that refuses to innovate is bad for everybody. Leave biases behind, go into a store (or multiple stores) try out different phones, and buy the one that is actually pleasurable to use. I used several blackberries for years, but the incredibly long full start-up/shutdown times, unusable internet, unintuitive controls, lack of worthwhile third party support, useless desktop client and generally unresponsive OS convinced me to switch. I even chose to leave Verizon. While Verizon definitely had better service and I had to spend 5 extra minutes to set up my email so it would push rather than fetch, I’ve had a tremendously improved experience. My phone just always works, when I want it to and how I want it to. In fact, it’s actually enjoyable just to use. Nothing like this was ever offered by the blackberry. http://caspan.com Caspan I love how people talk about the problems they use to have 3 years ago with phones.. Why don’t you try a Torch before bashing it? RIM is ever changing and to compare 3 years ago RIM to today’s RIM well just shows your knowledge of technology change. It’s like comparing a 4th generation iPhone to a 2nd generation one. They’re way different in reliability and applications. If you have an opinion make it informed or else you sound like the rest of the Kool-aid drinkers Steve Main steve@caspan.com Mitch I had this problem 3 months ago (literally) with my brand new blackberry that had just been replaced. In my 3 years with blackberry devices I had to replace my phones 5 times. Also, before I bought a different phone I tried out the latest blackberries (as of late June 2010), and they were no different. After 3 years of constant frustration with RIM and sub-par user experience I switched after significant research and my own testing. So please do not attempt to tell me that I’m not informed. People who disagree with you aren’t necessarily wrong. So i’m not comparing new iPhones to old blackberries. And even if I were, let’s say I compare the iPhone 4 to the first iteration: the same basic things are there — a great user interface, great web surfing, and it turned on in under 10 minutes. Now might the Blackberry Torch have completely resolved all of these issues one month after they drove me from RIM’s phones? It’s possible, but the bottom line is that my 2009 Blackberry was a much less pleasurable experience than the very first iPhone. Sorry if I didn’t wait another 3 years for Blackberry to get these basic issues in check. So while your argument establishes that the newest blackberry (taking what you say as true) brings it up to par with an iPhone, your point is irrelevant. Especially when I was responding to a RIM user, who like myself, got sick of having deal with a second-rate OS. Blackberry has its merits, but it needs to start innovating rather than having to play catch-up if it wants to be relevant. Also, you’re the one arguing blindly behind one brand, I’m saying there are better options. Enjoy RIM’s Kool-aid. Mitch There is a solution for Storm users. It’s called the iPhone.

Years later, his jokes still ring true, which is kind of terrifying. But if we read between the lines of his takedown of an industry leader, there are secret lessons to be learned not just about technology, but about the state of tech support in general. See, Black is no tech expert, and it’s for that very reason that this complaints about the industry are so valid. While more tech-savvy people may dismiss the fact that he doesn’t know how to download apps, there are lessons to be learned from his (comedic) pain. I’ve watched the video a number of times and have decided to provide you with a play-by-play of the first five minutes in order to illuminate the lessons there. Designers, product managers, tech support reps, and everyone in between: watch this clip to learn a few things about following through on UX design, and enjoy how Black’s signature cynicism gets folks laughing from both sides of the tech information barrier. On one side of it are all of us techies who provide the support. On the other are the users, those folks we’re supposed to be designing experiences around. So put your personas down for a sec, and let’s listen to a real human being with limited tech savvy give us a rundown on tech’s biggest liabilities. Intro: “They are not of us.” Here, Black pokes fun at the Apple Store, comparing it to life on other planets, and saying that the workers stand so close because they’re sniffing at you in order to get your data. We all know the best UX is the right combination of features, benefits, and constraints for a perfect experience, but sometimes that “perfect experience” can seem pitched at, well, life on Jupiter. And users are real flesh-and-blood people. This is where personas come in. For balanced and complete UX design, give as much focus to your personas post-conversion as you have to every moment before conversion. When you do, you’ll have real information extracted from actual use cases as opposed to focus groups or hypothetical personas . . . or aliens. 3:10: “They know better than we do.” Black relates a tale of an Apple employee correcting his friend’s pronunciation of his own name. This, according to your users, is what the average tech experience is like. Users tell us one thing, we correct them with our assumption, even when it’s completely wrong. Sometimes, we get so steeped in the data we’ve mined from personas that we’ve decided real use cases have to fall into one of our UX categories. Never forget: good design anticipates human behavior, it doesn’t dictate it. For you, this means your users will rarely fit snugly into the personas you’ve created. 4:15: “You can help AT&T build the infrastructure you thought you were getting when you bought the [phone].” In this bit, Black complains about the fact that he had to buy a transmitter so that his AT&T phone would function correctly. (If you’re reading this post, you’re probably savvy enough to recognize Apple and AT&T are two different characters in this sketch, which helps us steer away from Apple cynicism—when is that going to be a recognized and documented psych condition, BTW?) People who need tech support are not leads designed solely so that we can upsell to them. They’re clients who’ve already spent good money on the promises we’ve made. This offense by carrier companies—separately selling a component integral to the design’s intended functionality—is second only to the gaming industry’s rapidly emerging status quo of shipping before the product is ready and then selling patches to make the product whole post-release. Some are calling this emerging habit the tendency to “over-promise and under-deliver.” Let’s get this “over-promising” habit under control, lest we ship so fast that our products start blowing up in people’s pockets—oh, wait. 5:00: “You quit your contract, they will find you and shoot you in the leg.” Tech support reps: you’re humans, so this means you’ve had to call tech support yourself. If you get the wrong person on the line or have to deal with some sterile recording, it can be like riding the swirling currents of water going down a drain, can’t it? You can’t quite articulate your problem, so the voice at the other end keep finishing your own sentence. Or they keep transferring your call to a department “more suited to this issue.” It never ends. Worse is what happens when you get so frustrated that you simply want a refund or want out of your contract. What’s the response? An unsatisfying counter offer. “Sorry your wearable tech lasted only a year before falling apart. We can give you a discount towards a replacement!” “Well, we can’t terminate your contract. But we can give you HBO for free (for the next 2 weeks)!” Of course, tech support reps and customer service managers can’t always pull us out of a commitment that hasn’t been honored. We know this! But, please at least let us out of this phone call so we can get back to our lives—and show that you understand the maddening nature of the situation. Empathy goes a long way. Long after you’re done laughing at Black’s complaints, I urge all of you in the tech industry to put yourselves in other folks’ shoes. Designers: users decide market trends, not us. Cut them a little slack by anticipating their lack of immersion in designer communities when crafting experiences. Product managers: Don’t let the grandeur of your project distract you from small nuisances that might overburden your call center and hurt your brand. Finally, tech support reps: Use that silver tongue to exercise a little patience and grace. You may find that you and the harried, confused, exasperated client have more in common than you think. (Plus, you never know when you’re talking to a comic.) Carlos Herbert Hernandez is a freelance content manager, copywriter, and technical writer at a startup in Denver, Colorado.

Sections Deseret NewsUtah Utah Apple CEO tells Utah tech leaders to dream big By Jasen LeeDeseret News@JasenLee1 Published: Sept. 30, 2016 8:55 p.m. Updated: Sept. 30, 2016 11:06 p.m. 2 Comments SALT LAKE CITY — To many in the tech world, getting a glimpse of the chief executive officer of one of the most iconic technology companies in history is akin to music fans seeing their favorite rock star. To millions around the world, Apple CEO Tim Cook is THE rock star of tech — the living embodiment of success and innovation. Cook was the featured guest of Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, during a question and answer session with members of the Utah tech community Friday at the Grand America Hotel. He told the standing room only crowd gathering in the Imperial Ballroom that he never dreamed of being a CEO of Apple. “I never thought it possible,” Cook said. But he received the “call of a lifetime” from founder Steve Jobs in early 1998. “Five minutes into the discussion with him, I wanted to throw caution to the wind and join Apple,” Cook said. “And it was the best decision I ever made.” He told kids in the audience from two local grade schools to study hard and do great work, “and have faith that those things add up and will lead you on a journey that will be a most incredible journey.” When asked about the future of encryption as it relates to maintaining privacy of digital communication, Cook said his company is dedicated to keeping their customers’ information as safe as possible from hackers and also from government intrusion. He referenced a case where Apple was asked to break into the mobile devices of terrorists who perpetrated a mass shooting in San Bernardino, California, in 2015. The company refused multiple times citing privacy concerns. “This is one of the biggest issues that we face,” Cook said. “Encryption is one of the things that makes the public safe.” He advised budding entrepreneurs to decide what is most important to them — being first, being the best or making the most. At Apple, Jobs always preached about being the best, Cook said, and it's a principle the company follows to this day. For other companies, the choice may be different. But no matter the choice, Cook advised those in attendance to use that principle as their "north star.” Pick one and “go for it,” he added. “Our north star is making the best products that really enrich people’s lives,” Cook said. “If we can’t do (that), we pass.” Asked by Hatch how the company maintains Jobs’ motivation for success, Cook said the late founder's imprint is indelibly etched into the soul of Apple. “Steve’s spirit will always be in the DNA of the company,” he said. “It was his vision that Apple should make the best products and that they should enrich people’s lives. Lots of things will change with Apple, (but) that will never change.” Jobs' office at the firm's Silicon Valley headquarters is still intact — the same as he left it before his death, Cook said. Leaving it that way reminds the employees what he always wanted for the company. "It's important because I want his legacy to be with Apple (forever)," Cook said. "Not for Apple to be constrained by it  but we're very much married to his vision of making the best products that enrich people's lives. That doesn't change."

Share this sign up link with your friends. Ed note: Today's Daily Kickoff was crafted from the Washington Ideas Forum, a co-production of The Atlantic and the Aspen Institute. At 11:45am, Steve Clemons will interview Secretary of State John Kerry before he departs to Israel for the funeral of Shimon Peres. Other speakers include Robert Rubin, Pervez Musharraf, House Speaker Paul Ryan, and Jeffrey Goldberg interviewing the chef and founder of Momofuku, David Chang. [TheAtlantic] Ideas Forum Highlights -- Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz on what parts of the Iran deal are working: "I think on the nuclear side we got it right. Iran’s nuclear program is dramatically scaled back, as the agreement required. We have to remember that the agreement that we have is on one issue, which is the nuclear weapons — peaceful uses of nuclear energy issue. The fact that we’ve gone through three IAEA reports successfully clearly gives us some degree of comfort... We are at the beginning of a long process, which of course means that not only Iran but the international community, the agency, the United States, the government — we need to sustain our attention to this for a very long time... But obviously we hope that it will be one contributor to what is probably a decadal kind of march towards a stronger relationship.” [TheHill] Asked by Jeffrey Goldberg whether the way Trump has talked about Muslims hurts national security interests, CIA Director John Brennan said: "Making comments that are incendiary and that are viewed as attacking a religion or a people or a community only further drive those individuals to grasp onto those extremist views. They interpret a lot of the comments that are made as the West and the United States are against them ... It's the extremist comments on both sides of this have just fed those sources of extremism.” Brennan on Russia on whether Russia is trying to hack the presidential election: “The U.S. government right now is very much aware and working on the issue of who might be trying to get into and intrude in the electoral systems... What we do at CIA is to look at a country’s capabilities, look at their intent, look at things that they have done in the past, and determine whether something that certainly looks like a duck, smells like a duck and flies like a duck, whether it’s a duck or not.” [TheAtlantic]  REMEMBERING SHIMON: Obama orders flags at half-staff for Peres: "Obama's order covers all federal buildings and grounds throughout the United States and its territories, as well as U.S. embassies, military bases and other facilities abroad. The order directs flags to be flown at half-staff through sunset Friday." [AP; JTA]  Alon Pinkas, who served as an advisor to Peres and Israeli Consul General in NY: "On Wednesday morning, Nov. 4, 1992, I stepped into his office at the Foreign Ministry. At the time, I was Peres’ policy adviser. “Bill Clinton won the election in the US,” I said. “An hour ago he secured the required 270 electoral votes.”Peres looked at me, puzzled. “I’m sure you’re here to explain to me how and why this Clinton guy won, right?” Yes, I replied. “Listen carefully,” he impatiently blurted. “I met them all. I met Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, Ford, Carter, Reagan and Bush. I don’t need you to tell me how he won, but what he intends to do in the Middle East.”  -- "At 10:45 a.m. on 9/11 — minutes after the North Tower of the World Trade Center had collapsed — New York’s cellphone service was almost nonexistent. Yet, as I walked up Third Avenue, my phone rang. Peres was on the line. “You OK?” he asked. “You know where Don Rumsfeld is? Talk to me.” “Shimon,” I answered, “I’m the consul general in New York. Rumsfeld runs the Pentagon. How the hell do I know where he is?” Fine, Peres said. “These sh-ts hit New York! New York! Do you get that? I’m coming over.” A week later, he did. Would you have gone to any other country that underwent something like this, I asked. No, he said." [NYPost] BIDDING FAREWELL: Bret Stephens: "Israel’s Last Founding Father" [WSJ] • David Suissa: "Shimon Peres — Naïve and indispensable" [JewishJournal] •  Samantha Vinograd: "Five lessons we can all learn from Shimon Peres" [FoxNews] • Howard Goller: "On little sleep, Israel's Peres persevered in peace, politics" [Reuters] • Chemi Shalev: "The Countless Contradictions of the Late and Great Shimon Peres" [Haaretz] • Mary Kissel and Dan Senor: "Shimon Peres, Entrepreneur" [OpinionJournal] • Esther D.

In Many Ways, His Dream Faded Long Ago" [NYTimes] HAPPENING TODAY: At 2:50PM, President Barack Obama departs Joint Base Andrews en route to Tel Aviv to attend the Peres funeral on Friday in Jerusalem. The President will leave Israel following the official state ceremony. Former President Bill Clinton and Secretary of State John Kerry are joining as part of the U.S. delegation.  "Obama and Shimon Peres: Fast Friends Who Found Peace Out of Reach" by Peter Baker: "They were an international odd couple with seemingly little in common, a 40-something African-American born in Hawaii and an octogenarian Zionist born in a shtetl in Poland. But somehow Barack Obama and Shimon Peres hit it off." [NYTimes] "Bill Clinton's unfinished business in Israel" by Michael Crowley: "The future of the peace process is sure to be on Clinton’s mind when he attends his late friend’s funeral in Israel on Friday. Peres was seen as perhaps his country’s most determined advocate for a deal with Palestinians in which Israel would surrender long-occupied territory in exchange for an end to terrorist attacks. But while sources said Clinton, should he return to the White House, might feel compelled to try his hand at the peace process again, it’s far from clear whether that would make political sense for Hillary Clinton—or whether it would be more likely to succeed in a Middle East much changed since he left office 15 years ago." [Politico] NY Governor Andrew Cuomo to attend funeral: “New York is home to more than 1.7 million Jews – the largest Jewish community outside of Israel in the world – and the community is mourning the loss of a larger-than-life figure,” Cuomo said. “I will be traveling to Israel for President Peres’ funeral to pay my respects on behalf of all New Yorkers." [TimesUnion] Allison Kaplan Sommer explains why Hillary and Trump chose not to fly to Israel: "Travelling to Israel would likely score her some points among Jewish voters in the swing state of Florida. But still, even in Florida, the downside of heading to the Middle East in the heat of her campaign outweighed the advantages significantly... And considering some of Trump’s bedrock of support on the alt-right, who aren’t very friendly to Jews - showing up at an Israeli funeral wearing a yarmulke might be a little awkward. Let’s not forget that this is a candidate who has never been to Israel and who skipped his own grandson’s brit in order to campaign in Wisconsin during the Republican primaries." [Haaretz] "Gary Johnson Struggles To Name A Foreign Leader He Admires" by Mollie Reilly: "During an MSNBC town hall, moderator Chris Matthews asked the former New Mexico governor: “Name one foreign leader that you respect and look up to. Anybody.”  Johnson appeared stumped by the question, but running mate Bill Weld jumped in with an answer of his own. “Mine was Shimon Peres,” said Weld. Peres, the former president of Israel, died Tuesday. “I’m talking about living,” replied Matthews. “I guess I’m having an Aleppo moment,” Johnson said." [HuffPost] "In debate, Trump’s lack of nuclear knowledge on display" by Josh Rogin: "Trump’s lack of basic understanding about nuclear weapons policy is concerning enough. But even more troubling is Trump’s lack of progress over the past few months on national security issues overall. He simply refuses to make the effort to prepare himself for the job of commander in chief." [WashPost] "As One of Their Own Runs for President, Casino Executives Are Divided" by Alexandra Berzon:"At a rally earlier in the year in Las Vegas, Mr. Trump pointed out casino owner Steve Wynn in the crowd and said they were frequently in touch. Mr. Wynn spoke out recently in a conference call against U.S. monetary policy but did not endorse Mr. Trump." [WSJ] HEARD YESTERDAY - Bernie Sanders, campaigning in NH with Hillary Clinton: "If anybody tells you that this election is not important, you ask them why the Koch brothers and Sheldon Adelson and other billionaires, why they are spending hundreds of millions of dollars to elect their candidates." "For $25K, Miami donors can have dinner with Ivanka Trump" by Patricia Mazzei: "Trump's oldest daughter will headline a $25,000-a-head dinner fundraiser on Oct. 5, according to an invitation obtained by the Miami Herald. For $10,000, donors can get a photo with Ivanka Trump, and for $2,500, they can attend a reception. In addition to listing Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus and top Trump fundraisers Lew Eisenberg, Brian Ballard, Steven Mnuchin and Mel Sembler." [MiamiHerald] • Why Ivanka Is Trump's Top Surrogate [TheAtlantic] "Jewish Vote Seen As Key In Pa., Florida Battlegrounds" by Stewart Ain: “If the debate did anything, it probably broke for the moment the belief that he [Trump] had the energy and the momentum,” said Aaron David Miller. “The fact that Israel was not mentioned or discussed was not surprising,” he said. “There are so many more critical issues, and within 24 hours of the debate both met with Netanyahu. Both were photographed with the prime minister, and given the number of other issues it would have been hard for one candidate to attack the other on the Israel issue.” [JewishWeek] "Trump jokes: 'Raise your hand if you're not a Christian conservative'" by Jeremy Diamond: "Trump, touting the support he's received from evangelicals (in Iowa), called on his supporters at a rally here to identify themselves as "Christian conservatives." And then, he added: "Raise your hand if you're not a Christian conservative, I want to see this, right. That's -- oh, there's a couple, but that's alright. I think we'll keep them, right? Should we keep them in the room, yes? I think so." Trump's comment raised some eyebrows given that his rhetoric on the campaign trail is frequently nationalistic." [CNN] "Trump-Hitler comparison seen in New York Times book review" by Dylan Byers: "The review, which was published Wednesday, details (in bullet point format) the various factors that brought Hitler to power, from his own character traits to his use of mass media to the naïveté of his supporters. It does not mention Trump by name... The review comes as The New York Times takes an increasingly critical stance toward Trump." [CNNMoney] • Read the review [NYTimes] "Trump Mouthpiece Breitbart News Publishes Anti-Semitic Attack on Prominent Columnist" by Yair Rosenberg: "Breitbart published an anti-Semitic screed against Washington Post columnist Anne Applebaum. Titled “WaPo’s Anne Applebaum Embarks On Kremlin-Style Disinformation Offensive vs. the Anti-Globalist Right,” the piece is a meandering, conspiratorial critique of Applebaum’s political stances. And as meandering conspiratorial pieces tend to do, it ultimately introduces its target’s Jewishness for no reason at all." [Tablet] "Jerry Springer: My Guests Are Authentic, Not Liars Like Trump" by Andrew Kaczynski: “The people on our show aren’t making up lies. They’re upset. They’re angry. That’s totally different than Trump,” Springer said. “He’s not coming on the show because he’s angry. He’s coming on the show because he wants to be the leader. He’s got this ego, this narcissism. He just wants to be the leader of the world... This is not a guy who’s trying to fix his life. He obviously doesn’t particularly care about other people.” [BuzzFeed] EARLY EXIT: "Fulop says it's about Murphy, and only Murphy" by Matt Friedman: "In front of Jersey City Hall, the 39-year-old Fulop announced he will seek re-election in 2017 for a second term as mayor of New Jersey’s second-largest city, and that he will endorse his “good friend” Phil Murphy for governor that same year— a man who just weeks ago he called “desperate.” Fulop’s announcement came during the Bridgegate trial, where he could be called to testify about alleged pressure on him to endorse Gov. Chris Christie’s 2013 re-election in exchange for a favorable deal for a car import-related company he worked for that leased space for the Port Authority." [PoliticoNJ]  **Good Thursday Morning!

Open the app and it would immediately begin to broadcast using the front-facing camera, while notifying your friends that you were "in the house." Up to seven other friends could join you with a tap, appearing on your phone’s screen in video windows of their own. They called the app Houseparty — a name designed to suggest good times while courting a hip, young demographic." [TheVerge] "Apple is quietly developing 'iPhone 8' hardware in Israel" by Sam Shead: "Some hardware for the iPhone 8 is being created in Herzliya, Israel, according to a local Apple employee, who said employees in Israel work on all of Apple's new products. Speaking with Business Insider outside Apple's Herzliya office at Maskit Street 12, the Apple employee said employees in Israel were working on what's coming "next" in Apple's product line, giving a specific mention to the iPhone 8." [BI; Fortune]   SPOTLIGHT: "Doppler Labs And The Quest To Build A Computer For Your Ears" by Harry McCracken: "More than Noah Kraft's film career, it was his lifelong love of music that led him to tech. The founder of several rock bands over the years, Kraft took time during his film-producing stint to work on a friend’s electronic-music tour, helping to pick clubs and promote shows. As the tour went from venue to venue—usually small rooms with subpar acoustics—he was struck that his friend’s music sounded different in every space. "What if we could curate how we hear the world?" he recalls asking himself. "What if we could give ourselves more control?" [FastCompany] PROFILE: "The Beauty Upstart With a Radical New Way of Talking to You" by Marisa Meltzer: "Glossier (a play on the word dossier) doesn’t rely on celebrity ads or high-profile department store placements. Its founder, 31-year-old Emily Weiss, was a styling assistant at Vogue in 2010 when she launched the beauty blog Into the Gloss. As women flocked to the site to talk about their routines, Weiss began to realize that beauty companies had no idea what their customers were up to." [WiredMag] SPORTS BLINK: "The Man Who Brought the Nets to Brooklyn" by Neil deMause: "By the time Bruce Ratner sold the Nets and the Barclays Center to Russian billionaire Mikhail Prokhorov in early 2016, he had walked away with anywhere from a few hundred million to a couple of billion dollars worth of land, cash, and tax breaks, depending on whose accounting you chose to believe. He'd also spent $300 million on a sports franchise that he had seemingly no interest in, plus about $900 million more on an arena, and received something less than that in return. As deals went, it was pure Bruce Ratner: He may not have turned a huge profit, but he'd leveraged his political connections to put his stamp on his adopted borough — and Brooklyn would never be the same again." [Vice] DESSERT: "Keeping kosher, a California winemaker’s journey" by Kelly J. Hayes: "To receive the tiny, nearly imperceptible kosher symbol that appears on the back of each bottle, the wines must be made only by individuals who are certified as Shabbat-observant Jews. This means that [Jeff] Morgan himself cannot touch the wine, the juice, the machinery, even the buttons that control the machinery in the winemaking process.  Morgan’s quest has taken him beyond the vineyards and wineries to a place of more inspired personal spirituality. “I watched the people who made the wines. Saw how they prayed. How in touch they were with the process and their religion,” he shares. While he was born Jewish, Morgan was never bar mitzvahed. That will change on Nov. 5, when a 63-year-old California winemaker comes of age."

Apple flesh turns brown through the natural process of oxidation, but the people over at Okanagan Specialty Fruits hope to make this the way of the past with their Arctic Apples. Their science apples have been engineered to “silence” the polyphenol oxidase (PPO) enzyme that causes oxidation in apples. While this may not seem important, Okanagan Specialty Fruits claims that browning is responsible for 40 percent of apple waste. Unauthorized GMO wheat plants found growing in Washington state https://t.co/W4n6cdCXxypic.twitter.com/VpmHlmamW1— RT America (@RT_America) July 30, 2016 This approval comes at a critical point for the sake of genetically modified organisms (GMOs), particularly when it comes to food. While the USDA and Okanagan Specialty Fruits praised the decision, others were perturbed by the government allowing the commercial sale of more GMOs. "Many big apple buyers don't want this. Consumers don't want this. It's not only an unnecessary product, but the risks have not been fully examined," Wenonah Hauter, executive director of Food & Water Watch, told Eco-Watch. "Regulators have glossed over the possible unintentional effects of this technology, including the potential economic impacts on farmers, the potential of contamination for non-GMO and organic apple crops and the potential impact of the non-browning gene silencing, which could also weaken plant defenses and plant health," Hauter added. Farmers suing Syngenta over #GMO corn granted class action status in federal court https://t.co/yif2YTQiBWpic.twitter.com/WYqXxyYQgQ— RT America (@RT_America) September 28, 2016 In addition, comments on the announcement of the impending deregulation earlier this month were largely negative. The 626 comments were generally anti-GMO, but some were also displeased with the purely cosmetic benefits of the Arctic Fuji. “Apples turning brown is part of life,” one commenter wrote. Another said, “Please stop letting frankinfood on the market. There are too many uninformed people you will harm.” The Arctic Fuji won’t be the last GMO fruit from Okanagan Specialty Fruits, as they hope to have an Arctic Gala apple approved by the USDA in either 2017 or 2018.

Andrés Cardenal (TMFacardenal) Sep 30, 2016 at 9:21PM Image source: Getty Images.  Charlie Munger is Warren Buffett's co-pilot and one of the brightest investing minds ever. Munger believes investors should focus on high-quality companies and hold them for the long term, and he clearly knows what he's talking about. Let's take a look at some of what Munger has said and some companies that might fit his criteria. Why quality matters To some degree, business quality is in the eye of the beholder, and there are many aspects to consider when analyzing a company's quality. However, one of the most unmistakable traits of a high-quality business is its ability to sustain elevated returns on capital over the long term. The higher the returns a company can make on its capital, the higher the gains investors can expect over the years.  In Munger's own words: We have really made the money out of high-quality businesses. In some cases, we just bought the whole businesses. And in some cases, we just bought a big block of stock. But when you analyzed what happened, the big money has been made in the high-quality businesses. Over the long term, it is hard for a stock to earn a much better return than the business which underlies its earnings. If the business earns 6% on capital over 40 years and you hold it for 40 years, you are not going to make much different than a 6% return, even if you originally buy it at a huge discount. Conversely, if a business earns 18% on capital over 20 or 30 years, even if you pay an expensive-looking price, you end up with one hell of a result.  There are different ways to measure return on capital. Investors can focus on return on equity (ROE) or they can use a wider measure such as return on invested capital (ROIC). Leaving mathematical considerations aside, it's of the utmost importance to understand the main drivers behind elevated returns of capital and, above all, the sustainability of those factors. In a free-market economy, success attracts competition, so when a company is making above-average returns, other industry players try to steal away a share of those returns. That's why investors need to pay close attention to a company's competitive strengths, meaning the factors that allow it keep the competition at bay, protecting its markets and profit margins. In Buffett's language, we're talking about a company's "moat." Brand power can help fill a moat. Let's look at a few companies with strong brands. Powerful brands for superior returns Brand power is an extraordinary source of competitive differentiation, and it can make all the difference in the world for companies in the consumer sector. When a company owns a valuable brand, customers are willing to pay more than they would for similar products from the competition, with obvious implications in terms of profitability and return on capital. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a textbook example. According to a Forbes brand ranking, Apple is the most valuable brand in the world. In addition to brand value, Apple offers a sticky ecosystem of software, services, and applications embedded in its devices, and customers are notoriously loyal to the company.  Most industry players in consumer electronics struggle to make money, but Apple is the exception to the rule. According to data from Morningstar, Apple generated a ROE ratio around 37.9% over the past 12 months, while the ROIC ratio stands at nearly 23.5%. Nike (NYSE:NKE) is another high-quality business generating strong returns on capital thanks to its powerful brand. The Nike swoosh is one of the most recognized logos in the world, and the company has invested massive amounts of money into sponsoring the most renowned athletes in various sport disciplines. That commitment has made the company the undisputed heavyweight champion in sports shoes and apparel on a global scale. In addition to brand differentiation, scale advantages and a massive distribution network provide extra layers of competitive strength for Nike, and the company enjoys a ROE ratio of 30.1% and a ROIC ratio in the area of 26.6%. With almost 24,400 stores in 74 countries, Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) is building a global coffee emporium, and management is still finding new opportunities for profitable expansion, especially in emerging markets such as China. The company has nearly 2,300 stores in 100 Chinese cities, and it's planning to open 500 new stores per year in the country over the coming five years. Starbucks is all about providing a differentiated customer experience, and the brand is associated with quality and a very particular cultural footprint. Even if Starbucks charges higher prices than the competition, customers don't seem to mind paying a few extra bucks. Thanks to these strengths, Starbucks makes an impressive ROE ratio of 46.11%, while the company's ROIC ratio is around 29.3%. There is no infallible formula to picking winning stocks, but names such as Apple, Nike, and Starbucks look well-positioned to continue delivering above-average returns on capital in the years ahead. And I agree with Munger that that's something we should look for when picking stocks. Andrés Cardenal owns shares of Apple. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Apple, Nike, and Starbucks.

Home Church & Ministries U.S. World Politics Entertainment living Opinion Apple iOS 10 Messages New Features: Low Quality Photos, Read Receipts, Send Message Effects Among Messaging Highllights By Neal A. Lasta Sep 30, 2016 | 10:46 AM Apple has made a lot of changes in the Messages app for iOS 10. At its most basic level, the bubble is just a place to chat, but now it has a lot more features. For example, the Messages app now has its own app store. Its functionality is definitely no longer limited to sending text messages. Here are some of the more useful new additions to the Messages app. Low Quality Photos Apple is thoughtful enough to allow you to send lots of pictures through iMessages without worrying too much about your data plan limitations. This works by setting the Messages app to allow only low-quality photos to be sent. Yes, I want Breaking Christian News Submit To do this, just go to the Settings, then Messages, then reduce image size. With this feature, a 1 to 2 MB picture is reduced to just 100 KB. Read Receipts Individual read receipts allow you to choose which people can get read receipts; that is, which persons can identify that you've read their message or not. You don't want all your friends knowing that you ignored their messages. To enable this feature, just tap the upper right circular i on your message history and swipe "send read receipts" on. Send Message Effects When you type a message then hold the send button, a couple of effects appear; these include the invisible ink effect, whisper effect, and slam messages if you want to get that scream effect. You can also send messages with bubbles, confetti, laser light show, fireworks and a shooting star. Momento Momento is a GIF application that takes a couple of your photos and turns it into and transforms them into an animated GIF. You can then send your GIF to your friends on Messages. It's a good way to have fun, and it could be useful as well. Digital Touch Digital Touch provides extra features you can send with your messages. These include drawing your own symbol, and holding to send various pre-made symbols like hearts or kisses. Sticker Apps iMessage has a lot of sticker apps. One sticker app is called "Super Mario Run Stickers," which won't be available until December this year. According to BGR, with the Super Mario Run sticker app, you can "show off your feelings with Mario's expressions or use items to decorate your conversations and make them look like a scene from Mario's world. Another great sticker app is Disney Stickers. It includes all the popular Disney characters like Donald Duck, Minnie and Mickey Mouse.

Two just-released products could lead to upside for Apple's business -- and possibly shareholders, too. Daniel Sparks (TMFDanielSparks) Sep 30, 2016 at 7:50PM More consumers are interested in Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) new wireless AirPods than you might think, according to a new survey by Bank of America's investment arm Bank of America Merrill Lynch (via Business Insider). The same survey also suggested the company's second-generation Apple Watch could lead to more growth in the nascent segment. Will these two products be what Apple needs to help revenue turn upward again? Polling 1,000 consumers Though Apple's Sept. 7 event was focused primarily on its newest iPhones -- the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus -- it may be AirPods and Apple Watch Series 2 that investors should be thankful for. BAML's poll of 1,000 U.S. consumers regarding purchase intentions for the two devices suggests they could generate accretive revenue. AirPods. Image source: Apple. AirPods: In line with Apple's removal of the headphone jack from its newest iPhone, the company announced its first-ever Apple-branded wireless headphones at its September event. The headphones' premium price tag of $159 is high enough to provide a small boost to Apple's bottom line if even just a fraction of customers buy them. But would a fraction of Apple's customers even be interested? As it turns out, a surprising 12% of survey respondents indicated they intend to purchase AirPods. Applying this purchase intent rate to Apple's U.S. installed base, this new product could generate $3 billion in incremental revenue for the company, BAML pointed out. While $3 billion would only represent about a $1.4% increase to Apple's annual revenue, small increases like this are notable in light of the stock's conservative valuation. Apple Watch Series 2: Despite the fact that the second generation of Apple's new smartwatch only received internal upgrades -- and the exterior remained the same -- there's still meaningful interest in the updated version. Eight percent of respondents said they planned to buy the Watch Series 2. Apple Watch Series 2. Image source: Apple. Meaningful interest in the Apple Watch Series 2 is particularly notable because of the uncertainty surrounding this new product segment for Apple. It's not clear yet if wearable technology can turn into a meaningful business for the company. If BAML's estimates of purchase intent by U.S. consumers for the Apple Watch Series 2 is somewhat close to reality, the updated version of the device could be enough to help the segment continue growing meaningfully during fiscal 2016. But Apple still needs the iPhone While these segments could help provide the icing on the cake for Apple investors, the company will need the iPhone to hold its own for this potential upside revenue from its AirPods and Apple Watch to actually feel like a bonus. The iPhone accounted for a staggering 57% of the company's revenue in its most recently reported quarter. If the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus can't prevent a further decline in iPhone sales, accretive revenue from smaller, newer product segments simply won't be enough to return the tech company to growth. Fortunately, Apple's paltry price-to-earnings ratio of 13 means all Apple needs from its iPhone segment is for it to maintain current levels. Other new products and services can do the rest of the work needed for the stock's price today to make sense. Of course, this is easier said than done. Whether Apple's critical iPhone segment returns to growth in the near future or not, it's good to see budding areas with potential to supplement the company's revenue and bottom line.

Is that because Apple doesn’t care about the Macs? Time Cook says “I Love the Mac.” Or, more likely, could we be in for another major architectural change? Evidence is mounting that Apple really will abandon Intel and take the Mac lineup to ARM. Here’s the assessment. First, let’s look at the latest evidence from iDownloadBlog. macOS Sierra code suggests Apple could replace Intel in Macs with custom ARM chips That article nicely recounts the history of this notion, including this important section. And in 2014, former head of the Macintosh division Jean-Louis Gassée hinted that the first ARM-based Macs could appear in 2017. Gassée explained: If we follow this line of reasoning, the advantages of ARM-based processors vs. x86 devices become even more compelling: lower cost, better power dissipation, natural integration with the rest of the machine. For years, Intel has argued that its superior semiconductor design and manufacturing technology would eventually overcome the complexity downsides of the x86 architecture. But that ‘eventually’ is getting a bit stale. Other than a few showcase design wins that have never amounted to much in the real world, x86 devices continue to lose to ARM-derived SoC (System On a Chip) designs. The Key Issues In addition to what Jean-Louis Gassée explained abive, there are some other nuances to explore. Intel releases its new CPUs on its own timetable that doesn’t rigorously take into account Apple’s technical needs and product development cycle. All iOS devices use ARM. This change will make Xcode and development in general more coherent across platforms. It could lead to better synergies between iOS and macOS. The ARM processors in the latest iOS devices are 64-bit and more than competitive with CPUs from Intel in performance. Apple is the acknowledged expert in taking millions of customers though a major architecture change. The company did it first from Motorola 68K to PowerPC in 1998 and then PowerPC to Intel in 2005. The very long time since we’ve had updates to the Mac Pro, Mac mini, MacBook Air and MacBook Pro suggests (but doesn’t guarantee) that this architecture change has been in the works. Apple is taking its sweet time to do it right. That would include, perhaps, a Rosetta-like mechanism that allows current Intel-based Mac apps to run on the new Macs. Apple’s technical roadmap may well be diverging from Intel’s, one that has to take into account the needs of PC makers, not Apple. Perhaps Apple is done with this. Also, the nicety of installing Windows natively on a Mac with Boot Camp is a notion whose time has come and gone. Virtual Machine hardware in the ARM CPUs and an instruction translator would still allow Mac users to run VMs with Intel-based OSes like Windows and Linux. From what we’ve seen, modern ARM CPUs have the horsepower to do that. A new ARM-based MacPro? Perhaps not the droid we were looking for. Image credit: Apple That said, I strongly suspect that the MacBook Pros, rumored to be announced in October will be the last Macs with an Intel CPU, the Skylake series. The question now is, will Apple simply release the new MacBook Pros without mentioning the transition? This is important because if Apple tips its hand at an October event, too many customers might decide to wait until 2017 to upgrade their MBP. On the other, had, it could make sense to introduce an ARM-based Mac Pro or 5K iMac and suggest that the MacBook Pros will be the last Macs to make the transition in 2017/8. Mac customers would collectively breathe a sigh of relief to finally see what Apple is up to. And if you need a new MBP, buy it now (in October). It will be viable for years. Meanwhile, Apple will deliver a multi-CPU workhorse ARM-based Mac Pro/iMac for developers to get the ball rolling. This is a delicate maneuver for Apple because customers are hungry for new Macs, and the company would have to both plan for and announce these new Macs in the right sequence with the right messaging. Now we wait. Next page: The Tech News Debris for the Week of September 26th. The new Apple Echo chamber.

Unlike what has been going on over the last few years with Intel; Apple’s incessant desire to control everything possible can be better realized in this way. September 30, 2016 at 5:35 EST PM quakerotis September 30, 2016 I don’t think this will happen any time soon. ARM is great in single cores and multicores. It doesn’t have floating point, it doesn’t have multiple execution threads nor the thermal capacity to handle any of this. Benchmarks don’t tell the story. These are different tasks. Maybe someday, but not in the near future. September 30, 2016 at 5:48 EST PM quakerotis September 30, 2016 Additionally, Bootcamp and virtualization are not ideas whose time has come and gone. That is naive. Virtualization will only become more critical in the future, not less. And you’re absolutely wrong if you think Apple will deliver a Mac Pro with ARM. The Mac Pro’s problems are with the nonsensical design and the garbage Video cards they come with. September 30, 2016 at 5:50 EST PM belmikey September 30, 2016 Apple might do this–in fact, I wouldn’t be entirely surprised if they do this–but it would be foolish of them, and their sales would plummet as soon as people realized that nothing actually worked on them any more. Most games for the Mac, for example, are not ports–they run in an environment derived from WINE or its relations, and depend upon an x86 base. ARM CPUs are not yet nearly fast enough to provide decent performance doing instruction translation from x86 to ARM so that these capabilities would remain. Nothing would make me more likely to abandon the Mac platform. I don’t think I’m alone. September 30, 2016 at 6:07 EST PM vpndev September 30, 2016 This will happen but we should expect a lengthy transition. MacBook and MacBook Air are obvious candidates for starting the transition. This is almost in the “low hanging fruit” category. No huge need for big compute capacity or demanding video – so this would be easy. The Mac Pro is at the other end of the spectrum. It needs lots of crunch an that might be hard to do with ARM, especially given the tasks that these machines often do. I’d expect this one to be last in the line. belmikey: you’re right, but many games spend most of their time in code provided by libraries or the kernel, and not in actual application logic. Apple did a study of this back at the time of PPC->x86 transition and found that many apps were about 10% local code and 90% system/kernel/etc. So this hit might not be as bad as you fear. September 30, 2016 at 11:37 EST PM Bregalad October 1, 2016 I believe Apple is certainly moving in the direction or A-series processors in Macs. They want to control the whole widget and likely see improved compatibility with iOS devices as more important than compatibility with Windows. At the same time Apple seems eager to make further inroads in enterprise environments and moving away from the processor architecture and instruction set used in the vast majority of corporate hardware could be a huge mistake. When Macs relied on emulation you hardly ever saw one in a business setting. Once virtualization was possible Macs flooded into fields where they’d never been seen before. Maybe Apple truly doesn’t care about keeping Macs in business. Maybe they expect sales of iOS devices will be able to pick up the slack. Judging by the falling sales figures for iPads, however, that probably isn’t a viable approach. October 1, 2016 at 2:58 EST AM colinddarby October 1, 2016 Makes absolute zero sense for a number of reasons, seems nonsensical, user-hostile and would actually make the Mac’s less attractive, have less software, more expensive and would drive pro-users like me, over to Windows. However it will make them 0.3mm thinner because ARM series chips are slightly smaller than Intel ones, so I expect the transition to start in mid-October. In five new sparkly colours, including jet black. October 1, 2016 at 4:33 EST AM Guy B Serle October 1, 2016 The problem with most of the comments to this story is that you’re looking at it from your point of view and not Apple’s. Many of you have said that it seems like Apple no longer cares that much about the Pro market and this fits right in with a move like this. Other than FCP and Logic, what pro apps are left from Apple? How much money does Apple actually make from the pro market as compared to the consumer side? The answer is…not much. If they can keep 80-90% of their customer base after switching to ARM and still keep their same margins while offering lower prices across their line, the loss of the pro market as compared to new potential consumers is nothing. Remember as well that with iOS Apple is beginning to make inroads to the Enterprise market which has the potential to be huge. Apple is better suited to take a chance like this than they were when they switched from 68xxx to PPC or PPC to Intel. They have a tremendous war chest that can easily weather any financial storm for 5-10 years. They have a strong Mac market that has grown quite a bit since 2005 and there’s still a quiet revolt over the changes made since the release of Windows 8 and 10. People are looking for something different but don’t want to pay the Mac tax. If Apple can lower their prices and still keep their margins this could be a win for nearly everybody. Microsoft and Adobe will release ARM versions of their software for the Mac (assuming it happens natch). They’d be crazy not to. Heck MS is already there with iOS and Android version of Office October 1, 2016 at 10:32 EST AM aka_JYeager October 1, 2016 What will happen to hardware sales after someone figures out how to run that version of macOS on a Raspberry Pi (a $35 ARM based computer)? October 1, 2016 at 12:51 EST PM John Martellaro October 1, 2016 Guy B Serle: That’s a great summary of the situation. October 1, 2016 at 5:24 EST PM brilor October 1, 2016 Evidence is mounting that Apple really will abandon Intel and take the Mac lineup to ARM. I see reasoned guesses, speculation and discussions portraying a parallel to Apple’s PPC to Intel transition but no actual evidence. First, there is no way an A10 can perform the sustained computing that is often done on a Mac. It is good for short ( few seconds ) bursts of intensive usage but more intensive tasks are beyond it right now. Sure, Apple might have longer-term plans to couple ARM and Macs but the A10 isn’t it. Yes, the future of the Mac Pro and anything “Pro” ( and I mean really Pro not just the labels Apple slaps on devices that are borderline to not pro ) is tentative based on extrapolation of current evidence ( i.e. almost three years since a Mac Pro rev and cancellation of their only monitor with suggestions to buy competitor’s monitors ), so if the Mac Pro has been canceled it makes it easier for Apple to wield some future ARM product. Of course a top of the line 27 inch iMac currently can out compute ( and for longer periods ) an A10 and Apple keeps the iMac mostly up-to-date ( so there is no indication of its eminent demise thus giving Apple fewer Macs to address with its ARM ). So, while Apple *may* take the Mac to ARM, the question is when. The answer is when ARM is ready technically plus the other details need to be sorted out( Mac users who like to run Windows in Boot Camp is one, when licensing deals allow it and more ). October 1, 2016 at 8:49 EST PM DudeMac October 1, 2016 I would have to see Macs with ARM inside 🙂 October 1, 2016 at 9:22 EST PM DudeMac October 1, 2016 I would love to see Macs with ARM inside 🙂 October 1, 2016 at 9:23 EST PM BradMacPro October 2, 2016 Apple’s A series processors are approaching the performance of that which is used in the MacBook. So a future MacBook could use ARM, as Apple’s advances in performance are exceeding Intel’s jumps. It will be a few generations and years before we could see a Apple ARM derived design in a iMac and even longer before in a MacPro. All that being the case, more and more people are not seeking faster performance from their computers than what exists now, so Apple A series could catch up to that level. The switch from Intel based macOS based to Apple A series based Macs could be helped along with a system similar to the Rosetta system used up to Snow Leopard. October 2, 2016 at 12:06 EST AM geneking7320 October 2, 2016 How about the Macintosh retain Intel chips (until they are not profitable) and Apple introduces a new line of computers with ARM chips named after a different apple? October 2, 2016 at 12:27 EST AM John Martellaro October 2, 2016 You guys seem focused on a 1:1 replacement. I’m thinking about 8 or 16 modified A10s (16 or 32 high performance ARM cores) in a MacBook. Many more in a desktop. Good-bye quad core MBP, hello 32 cores. October 2, 2016 at 12:49 EST AM brilor October 2, 2016 The switch from Intel based macOS based to Apple A series based Macs could be helped along with a system similar to the Rosetta system used up to Snow Leopard. It will probably easier than that and it’s easy to imagine such a translator won’t be required because Apple already provides several layers of abstraction for AppKit and Foundation frameworks. Plus iOS( ARM ), already uses AppKit/Foundation, so many apps will rebuild with minor Xcode changes unless the developer is writing low-level, non-standard framework code. Even though a Mac ARM strategy is certainly possible, it isn’t clear to me if there is strong motivation to move away Intel. For all their delays, Intel probably offers Apple low prices given the volume of chips they purchase, plus they want to incent Apple’s purchase other Intel chips. Macs are only a small part of Apple’s business, and assuming they plan to keep producing Macs ( else why invest the time/money to change them to ARM ), only Apple knows if Mac ARM is justified at a business ( accounting ) level. I hope Apple starts building more innovative products with features we want but realize a large corporate public company maximizing profits and minimizing expenses ( consolidating CPU platforms is one such strategy along with the other synergies it confers ) is constrained. October 2, 2016 at 1:24 EST AM Paul Goodwin October 2, 2016 Not sure moving to ARM processors in Macs would be any less of a mistake than it was for Apple to move to the PowerPC. In the beginning there were all sorts of charts showing how technically the PPC chip development would far outstrip the Intel ones in speed and functionality. It never happened, and eventually the market was industrial embedded processing and about 1% of the computers sold as the Mac’s market share dwindled because of compatibility issues with the x86 world and limited software choices. There were some great PPC Macs, but eventually it proved to be a bad technical move. October 2, 2016 at 9:20 EST AM Scott B in DC October 2, 2016 To the vast majority, nobody cares what the hardware looks like inside the box. Only the geeks care. Most users only care that their computers work, that I can run their software, and that they won’t get any viruses. Other then the kicks the only community that would care are those with heavy computing needs, like the creative community. However, their needs are being satisfied with multicore high performance graphics cards. If most of the graphics and floating point computations are being handed off to these graphics subsystems, and what difference does it make if an ARM chip has flooding point or not. BTW, this is another back to the future moment. In years gone by, in the time of storage to put terminals which is equivalent to today’s web browser, floating point processors for separate from the CPU. The microprocessor industry championed the integrated processor chip. Now it’s being broken up again. Everything old is now new! October 2, 2016 at 10:33 EST AM GraphicMac October 2, 2016 All the numbered points (save for #1 and #2) made by the author shows a misunderstanding of the subject matter in some cases, assumes a whole lot incorrectly, are wildly speculative or are completely wrong. October 2, 2016 at 10:36 EST AM Wulfkind October 2, 2016 I think this line of thinking that Apple is eventually going to go ARM over Intel has further credence when one realizes that Intel announced this year they are getting out of the phone and tablet CPU business. Their ATOM line of CPU’s were cut down iCoresomething CPUs originally made for desktops and laptops and these CPU’s were being marketed and sold to device manufacturers from NAS designers to phone and table manufacturers. Particularly with the phone manufacturers Intel literally spent BILLIONS of dollars in rebates and cross-marketing in order to entice phone ODMs to start using Intel ATOM CPUs instead of ARM. It was a spectacular failure and Intel bowed out this year. Now Intel is trying to pitch what is left of the ATOM line ( they’ve killed that name BTW ) to ODM’s in the 2in1 Hybrid tablet/laptop space in the Windows world. So….just like the PowerPC alliance began to stagnate, particularly in the mobile space ( think Motorola PowerPC 4 ) and in the desktop space ( think IBM PowerPC 5 series CPUs ) Intel has stagnated and dropped out of the key mobile space where Apple is seeing the most innovation and revenue. Apple HATES not being seen as the most innovative in any aspect of their portfolio particularly when they feel they are being held back by a third party…..so….why not go “in-house” with their own home grown ARM based CPU? So….in my humble opinion…..you will see an ARM base Apple Air in the 2017-18 time frame, an entire mobile portfolio based on ARM in 2018-19 timeframe ( think Macbook, Air, iPad, iPod, Phone and Watch ) and in the 2019-2020 range you will see the first Apple desktop with an ARM cpu. October 2, 2016 at 2:22 EST PM brilor October 2, 2016 Scott B wrote: … the only community that would care are those with heavy computing needs, like the creative community There are lots of folks who purchased a Mac because they can run Windows applications natively ( i.e. without a VM ). They are just normal users and not necessarily the creative community. Apple would potentially lose these customers by switching to ARM. John M. wrote: I’m thinking about 8 or 16 modified A10s (16 or 32 high performance ARM cores) Good point but this would require major software changes( and many developers might be either reluctant or not skilled enough to implement – ( it is difficult even with GCD – Grand Central Dispatch ) because most applications run on a single core ( main queue in GCD ) and use only one core. Even some of Apple’s apps are written for a single ( main queue with the UI ) core. I’m not saying this isn’t solvable but it would be a problem today and it would be a major effort. Moreover, a solution would probably require a major investment by Apple and it’s not clear they have the will to do this.

The software to support different processing units is already in the OS. October 2, 2016 at 4:51 EST PM JustCause October 2, 2016 Those of us that work in corporate jobs that require access to Windows running well (without a crappy Wintel PC) think this is a really, really bad idea. October 2, 2016 at 5:03 EST PM archimedes October 2, 2016 “Apple is the acknowledged expert in taking millions of customers though a major architecture change.” Not again! 🙁 As nice as ARM may be, it’s really convenient to be able to run Windows for games and apps that need it. One great thing about Windows is that customers haven’t had to go through these architectural switches, which are painful. As much as I prefer the Mac, I have to say that Windows definitely has better backward compatibility in terms of both software and hardware. October 2, 2016 at 7:43 EST PM archimedes October 2, 2016 p.s. I note that Microsoft has dabbled in other architectures such as MIPS, itanium, and ARM, but they never abandoned x86 the way Apple abandoned 68K and PPC. October 2, 2016 at 7:44 EST PM archimedes October 2, 2016 That being said, Apple could surprise us all with an A12 processor that had … x86 compatibility. I think it would be a mess, but it would be an interesting one. October 2, 2016 at 7:47 EST PM John C. Welch October 3, 2016 Virtual Machine hardware in the ARM CPUs and an instruction translator would still allow Mac users to run VMs with Intel-based OSes like Windows and Linux. From what we’ve seen, modern ARM CPUs have the horsepower to do that. Well then, you should be able to provide a fine list of real world devices that folks here can buy to test this out for themselves. You know, a nice laptop or desktop.

The likelihood Apple has written ( if they didn’t start it years ago it won’t be ready anytime soon ) and will embed it in an ARM CPU is very unlikely, both technically and at a business level, IMO and there is certainly no evidence to support such an endeavor. Nice fantasy though. October 3, 2016 at 11:14 EST AM Albatrossflyer October 3, 2016 let’s see…. a MacBook with an ARM processor makes it an iPad with a keyboard, which makes its a MS Surface.

If Apple moves to ARM without getting their ARM processor performance drastically better, it’s not a viable option for me. October 3, 2016 at 3:09 EST PM Old UNIX Guy October 3, 2016 It doesn’t matter what CPU Apple puts in future Macs if they don’t reverse the downhill slide they’re on with the quality of their software. If it’s not iOS or watchOS they clearly don’t care. Switching to ARM CPUs isn’t going to help that. Dumping Craig Federighi and bringing back Betrand Serlet might (along with letting Jony Ive be the CDO for stores, $10K watches, and $100K cars ONLY)… October 3, 2016 at 3:10 EST PM Andrush October 4, 2016 Hey Guys,: Heavy duty hardware vendors are already building devices to put ARM chips into Data Centres: http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/10/04/kaleao_kmax_armbased_server/ It’s only a matter of time. How much time? Who knows? Perhaps Apple? October 4, 2016 at 10:43 EST AM brilor October 4, 2016 @Old UNIX Guy: Agreed. @Andrush: True but Apple is about high profit margins which means squeezing standard vendors ( Intel, TSMC, AMD etc. ) for major price concessions. To secure price concessions, Apple avoids vendors selling items they won’t discount because they aren’t made is mass quantities. Virtually all knowledgeable folks agree it’s technically possible but a lot of factors suggest it won’t happen anytime soon ( read prior posts for some ideas ). Brian October 4, 2016 at 1:28 EST PM Macsee October 12, 2016 iOS is a jailed limited toy. Mac is a full computer. Intel x86 compatibility is a must. Or else, switch to Windows. A shame for all.

Two just-released products could lead to upside for Apple's business -- and possibly shareholders, too. Daniel Sparks (TMFDanielSparks) Sep 30, 2016 at 7:50PM More consumers are interested in Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) new wireless AirPods than you might think, according to a new survey by Bank of America's investment arm Bank of America Merrill Lynch (via Business Insider). The same survey also suggested the company's second-generation Apple Watch could lead to more growth in the nascent segment. Will these two products be what Apple needs to help revenue turn upward again? Polling 1,000 consumers Though Apple's Sept. 7 event was focused primarily on its newest iPhones -- the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus -- it may be AirPods and Apple Watch Series 2 that investors should be thankful for. BAML's poll of 1,000 U.S. consumers regarding purchase intentions for the two devices suggests they could generate accretive revenue. AirPods. Image source: Apple. AirPods: In line with Apple's removal of the headphone jack from its newest iPhone, the company announced its first-ever Apple-branded wireless headphones at its September event. The headphones' premium price tag of $159 is high enough to provide a small boost to Apple's bottom line if even just a fraction of customers buy them. But would a fraction of Apple's customers even be interested? As it turns out, a surprising 12% of survey respondents indicated they intend to purchase AirPods. Applying this purchase intent rate to Apple's U.S. installed base, this new product could generate $3 billion in incremental revenue for the company, BAML pointed out. While $3 billion would only represent about a $1.4% increase to Apple's annual revenue, small increases like this are notable in light of the stock's conservative valuation. Apple Watch Series 2: Despite the fact that the second generation of Apple's new smartwatch only received internal upgrades -- and the exterior remained the same -- there's still meaningful interest in the updated version. Eight percent of respondents said they planned to buy the Watch Series 2. Apple Watch Series 2. Image source: Apple. Meaningful interest in the Apple Watch Series 2 is particularly notable because of the uncertainty surrounding this new product segment for Apple. It's not clear yet if wearable technology can turn into a meaningful business for the company. If BAML's estimates of purchase intent by U.S. consumers for the Apple Watch Series 2 is somewhat close to reality, the updated version of the device could be enough to help the segment continue growing meaningfully during fiscal 2016. But Apple still needs the iPhone While these segments could help provide the icing on the cake for Apple investors, the company will need the iPhone to hold its own for this potential upside revenue from its AirPods and Apple Watch to actually feel like a bonus. The iPhone accounted for a staggering 57% of the company's revenue in its most recently reported quarter. If the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus can't prevent a further decline in iPhone sales, accretive revenue from smaller, newer product segments simply won't be enough to return the tech company to growth. Fortunately, Apple's paltry price-to-earnings ratio of 13 means all Apple needs from its iPhone segment is for it to maintain current levels. Other new products and services can do the rest of the work needed for the stock's price today to make sense. Of course, this is easier said than done. Whether Apple's critical iPhone segment returns to growth in the near future or not, it's good to see budding areas with potential to supplement the company's revenue and bottom line.

Why don’t they? New York Times Published 5:47 pm, Friday, September 30, 2016 The court filings paint a grisly picture: As Ashley Kubiak sped down a Texas highway in her Dodge Ram truck, she checked her iPhone for messages. Distracted, she crashed into a sport utility vehicle, killing its driver and a passenger and leaving a child paralyzed. With driving fatalities rising at levels not seen in 50 years, the growing incidence of distracted driving is getting part of the blame. Now a lawsuit related to that 2013 Texas crash is raising a question: Does Apple — or any cell phone maker or wireless company — have a responsibility to prevent devices from being used by drivers in illegal and dangerous ways? The product liability lawsuit, filed against Apple by families of the victims, contends that Apple knew its phones would be used for texting and did not prevent Kubiak from texting dangerously. The suit is unlikely to succeed, legal experts said, and a Texas magistrate in August preliminarily recommended that the case be dismissed on grounds that it was unlikely that lawyers could prove that the use of the iPhone caused the accident. Kubiak was convicted of negligent homicide and sentenced to five years on probation. Her lawyer, Jason Cassel, said she now keeps her phone in the back seat. The case has brought to light a piece of evidence that legal and safety experts say puts Apple in a quandary — one it shares with other wireless companies. In Apple’s case, the evidence shows, the company has a patent for technology designed to prevent texting while driving, but it has not used it. Apple, Verizon, AT&T and other companies caution about the risks of distracted driving — and they acknowledge that laws and public education aimed at curbing the behavior are not working. It suggests to legal experts that they can foresee that their product can be used for illegal, dangerous and sometimes deadly activity. AT&T even suggests that the behavior has addictive qualities, meaning drivers cannot help themselves. But the companies — although they offer manual ways to shut down texting on the road — do not deploy technology that takes the decision out of drivers’ hands altogether. “The technology exists; we just don’t have the stomach to implement it,” said Deborah Hersman, the president of the National Safety Council and the former chairwoman of the National Transportation Safety Board. Generally, companies have taken the position that text-blocking technology is embryonic and unreliable. They argue that they cannot shut down a driver’s service without the potential of mistakenly shutting off a passenger’s phone or that of someone riding on a train or bus. Instead, companies have taken the approach of simultaneously warning and enabling, a mixed message that underscores a complex swirl of economic, technological and social factors. Perhaps the most pointed question is this: Even if the technology worked to perfection, would people accept having their service blocked? After all, the idea of mobile phone service is to let people communicate on the go. David Teater, formerly of the National Safety Council and now a private consultant on road safety, who lost his own son to a distracted driver, said companies clearly feared the consequences of cutting off service for their paying customers. It’s an industry, he said, in which one of the most frightening words is “churn” — meaning the loss of a customer to a competitor. In the Apple case in Texas, lawyers who brought the suit had unearthed a fascinating document: a patent filing that Apple made in 2008, which the lawyers said was granted in 2014, for technology that would “lock out” a driver’s phone by using sensors to determine if the phone was moving and in use by a driver. If so, it would prevent certain functions, like texting. In the patent, Apple says such technology is necessary because: “Texting while driving has become so widespread that it is doubtful that law enforcement will have any significant effect on stopping the practice,” and “Teens understand that texting while driving is dangerous, but this is often not enough motivation to end the practice.” It is unclear whether Apple has developed the lockout technology. Apple says it has taken other steps to address distracted driving. Its CarPlay integrates with some cars so drivers can use voice commands to control some functions of the car and the phone, including letting them orally compose text messages and listen to incoming ones. The technology, Apple says, “allows you to stay focused on the road.” “We discourage anyone from allowing their iPhone to distract them by typing, reading or interacting with the display while driving,” Apple said in response to questions. The company did not directly address whether it could or should shut down phone functions. Rather, it indicated that the responsibility was with the driver. “For those customers who do not wish to turn off their iPhones or switch into Airplane Mode while driving to avoid distractions, we recommend the easy-to-use Do Not Disturb and Silent Mode features,” it said. These approaches put the onus on drivers to make decisions each time they enter a car or receive a message. In addition, voice-activated systems raise other concerns, said Dr. David Strayer, an expert on driver attention at the University of Utah, who said he had studied CarPlay and the feature allowed drivers to perform some functions that could take their attention off the road. “It does not eliminate driver distraction — not even close,” Strayer said. Technology is on the market that can block a driver from having to make a decision. One company, Cellcontrol, sells a device that mounts on the dash and that uses high-frequency sound waves to identify a phone’s location. If the phone’s user is in the driver’s seat, the device can lock out prohibited services. The $129 device, which looks like a small turtle shell, “is very accurate,” said Cellcontrol’s chief technology officer, Joe Breaux. The hiccup is that the technology can sometimes turn off the phone of a passenger sitting behind the driver. Apple, in its patent, said it is developing “a process in which handheld computing devices can provide a lockout mechanism without requiring any modifications or additions to the vehicle.” It would use sensors to determine whether the phone was moving, and its location. By not putting the technology in place, Apple has “failed in their social responsibility,” said Christopher Kutz, a professor at UC Berkeley School of Law who specializes in the moral and legal principles of liability. “They should’ve done it, and even done it at a market risk.” Apple isn’t the only tech giant recognizing the dangerous behavior and not preventing it. Verizon also suggests that current laws are insufficient. “While text messaging is banned for drivers in 46 states and the District of Columbia, many people continue to do it, despite knowing the dangers,” Verizon says on a site that promotes free apps and other services available for iPhone and Android that can detect if a phone is being used by a driver and prevent texting. The Verizon messaging app has a driving mode that, when in use, detects if someone is connected to a car’s Bluetooth system and delivers an automatic response to the sender that the recipient is driving, said spokeswoman Kelly Crummey. However, the message still arrives on the recipient’s phone, allowing the opportunity to check it, Crummey said. AT&T encourages the use of a free app, Drivemode, that can stop incoming texts. “Everyone knows texting and driving is dangerous, yet when a text message comes in, it’s difficult not to respond,” AT&T says in promoting the app. In fact, AT&T commissioned research by an addiction expert who, in an AT&T news release in 2014, said that using a phone sets off releases of dopamine that makes it hard to resist the ping. “If that desire for a dopamine fix leads us to check our phones while we’re driving,” David Greenfield, who founded the Center for Internet and Technology Addiction, said in the AT&T news release,” a simple text can turn deadly,” Latest from the SFGATE homepage: Click below for the top news from around the Bay Area and beyond.

Not like this Eli Blumenthal, USA TODAY , KHOU 6:06 PM. CDT September 30, 2016 The Apple logo sits on a sign outside company's Covent Garden store on September 29, 2016 in London, England.

Spotted by The Next Web, a disgruntled customer, apparently unhappy with his customer support experience, went into an Apple Store in Dijon, France and proceeded to destroy iPhones, iPod Touches and a MacBook Air with what appears to be a boule ball, a heavy ball used in a variety of games in France. Realizing that he was on video, the man addressed the camera saying that Apple was a company that "violates consumer's rights." "They refuse to reimburse me as it is written by the European law of the consumer. I told them give me back my money, they say no. Here is what is going on now." In videos of the incident posted on social media the unnamed man smashes the various Apple devices for a full minute before security steps in to take him out of the store. Subsequent videos show the man trying to escape mall security before being apprehended a second time. According to French news site LeJournal the suspect has since been taken into police custody. The investigation is said to be ongoing.  In the future, if you're unhappy with Apple or other technical support try calling and asking to chat with a supervisor. You'll likely get better results than this.

Close share panel Apple has announced it is to set up home inside Battersea Power Station, taking over six floors in the central boiler house of the iconic building. It is an impressive structure from the outside, but if Apple wants to keep up with its rivals in terms of style and quirkiness on the inside, the company has its work cut out. Fellow tech giant Google has London offices in Soho. There are many unusual features, including a Routemaster bus in one of the rooms, and a chintzy area called the Granny Flat for workers to kick back and relax.

Impressive drone footage shows the site’s latest progress ahead of its end of year completion deadline. Construction work begun on Apple Campus 2 in 2014, after some delays. The subsequent development of the futuristic headquarters has been regularly showcased in drone videos. READ MORE: Drone gets peek at Apple’s new ‘spaceship’ campus (VIDEO) A newly-released aerial tour of the campus suggests the focus of work had turned to the finishing touches as fewer construction cranes are on site than before. Only a few sections of the “spaceship” remain unroofed as work continues to progress on the 100,000 square foot fitness center, the underground auditorium – which will be used for Apple’s product reveals and the R&D facility. The footage also show the underground tunnel which will be used to connect various parts of the campus and the parking garages which will be able to hold 11,000 vehicles. Meanwhile the installation of solar panels is now 40 percent complete Work has also shifted to landscaping as the first trees are planted. Eighty percent of the site which is a mile in circumference and one-third of a mile wide will be green space planted with fruit trees. The project reportedly costs in the region of $5 billion and is expected to be complete by the end of this year, with its some 13,000 employees supposed to move in at the start of 2017.

Image: Asus The Asus ZenBook UX305CA hails from a successful line of ZenBook Ultrabooks first launched in 2011. The UX305CA can be compared to Apple's MacBook (2016), partly because of its appearance -- the original ZenBooks had distinctive brushed aluminium patterns that aren't on the creamy white UX305CA -- and partly because it has the same Skylark-based Core m3-6Y30 and 8GB of RAM. The two laptops look and perform much alike, despite their noticeably different screen sizes. The ZenBook UX305CA I had on loan from Asus for a few months had a matte IPS screen with a resolution of 3200 x 1800 pixels and accurate color rendering. It beats the MacBook's screen resolution of 2304 x 1440 pixels, though the UX305CA obviously has a bigger screen: 13.3 vs 12 inches. Neither laptop has a touch-sensitive screen, so you have to rely on trackpad gestures. Having now spent several years with touch-screen laptops and tablets, I missed this feature a lot. The ZenBook UX305CA obviously beats Apple's MacBook in the number of ports. Where the MacBook has a single USB type C port, the UX305 has three USB 3.0 ports, a microHDMI port and -- great for photographers -- an SD card slot. Although it doesn't have a full-sized Ethernet port, Asus provides a USB-to-RJ45 cable. The UX305CA also has a higher-resolution 720p webcam than the MacBook's 480p FaceTime camera. The Core m chip design falls between the Atom and mainstream Core chips in terms of performance, but offers better battery life. I found it perfectly adequate for everyday tasks such as email, web browsing, and word processing with Microsoft Office. It also runs Adobe Lightroom, though I wouldn't recommend it for Adobe Creative Suite. In use All-in-all, the ZenBook UX305CA has a lot going for it, starting with the aluminium construction and very good screen. It's very thin, has lots of ports, and is reasonably priced. I thought the cream surface might pick up my inky fingerprints but it still looked like new after the occasional wipe down. But there's always a but, and this case, I have two. First, I didn't much like the keyboard, which isn't backlit and has tiny cursor keys. I admit to a preference for big clicky keys, and I've never found an Ultrabook keyboard I've actually liked. If you're used to flat Chiclet-style keyboards, you may well like it, but I've had better Asus keyboards. (As it happens, the Apple MacBook's keyboard is also worse than the MacBook Air and Pro keyboards. Being ultra-thin has its price.) On the other hand, the UX305CA's trackpad is both big and good, though not quite up to Apple standards. You won't end up packing a mouse. Second, the battery life could be better, I was getting about six hours of web-connected work out of the UX305CA with normal settings (ie not a power saving mode). This is somewhat short of the promised "up to 10 hours". It would be good for a full-spec Core chip, but I'd hoped for a little more from a Core m3 with a 44Whr battery. The otherwise similar MacBook, which only has a 41.4Whr battery, also claims "up to 10 hours of wireless web". It would be interesting to run the two side by side. I suspect that with the same screen brightness and my typical work patterns, the result would be roughly the same. At least modern power adaptors are small and light enough to carry around.... Crapware My UX305CA loaner arrived with quite a lot of bundled software, not all of it useless. The selection included Cyberlink Power Director 12 and Cyberlink Photo Director 5, WPS Office for Asus (otherwise known as Kingsoft Office) and Foxit Phantom PDF, Magix Music Maker Jam, Ice Power's Audio Wizard, WinRAR 5.40, Evernote 5, TeamViewer 10, and McAfee anti-virus software. It also included some Asus utilities such as Asus Smart Gesture, Asus USB Charger Plus, and WinFlash, which is a BIOS update utility. WPS Office starts in premium mode and the word processor was more than good enough to write this review. Cyberlink Photo Director 5 seems reasonable, and offers a paid upgrade to the current version. I didn't run any of the others. Benchmarks As usual, I ran the NovaBench benchmark on the UX305CA, because it's quick, easy, and free. It means you can test your current laptop for comparison purposes. The Core m3-6Y30 was unusual in producing inconsistent results for CPU speed, which presumably depends on its variable clock speed. In six tests, the CPU scores ranged from 285 to 321, but all of them were lower than the 346 scored by the same CPU in a Lenovo Yoga 700. On balance, I'm plumping for a NovaBench score of 562, because the UX305CA managed that in half the tests. This was made up of 180 points for the 8GB memory, 321 for the CPU, 44 for the HD515 graphics and 17 for the storage. This is significantly better than the 408 scored by an Asus T100HA with an Atom x5-Z8500, and significantly worse than the 766 scored by a Dell Latitude E5470 with a Core i5-6300U, both of which I've reviewed here. Conclusions The UX305CA is a good-looking, well-made silent (fanless) and cool-running 13.3-inch portable at a good price. You can get one with the Quad HD screen and 256GB of storage for less than £650 inc VAT, which compares with £1,049 ($1,299) for a similar 12-inch Apple MacBook. And, of course, you could save even more by shopping around for a UX305 with a lower-res screen and 128GB of storage, depending on your needs. The Core m3-6Y30 offers more performance than an Atom chip, and is fine for everyday use word processing and browsing. However, if it's your main machine, you'd be better off with a different model with a Core i5 or i7. There are plenty of those in the ZenBook range.

Usually folks are pretty charged up about a new iPhone, but this year's iPhone 7 release brought a controversy about Apple's decision to kill the headphone jack. I'm sure in a year or two, we'll all scratch our heads and realize it really wasn't that important after all. Apple has a history of deciding when we've had enough of technology like the floppy disk and optical drive. It's usually ahead of the pack on these decisions, and once the offending feature has been cut from one product, expect it to disappear from subsequent product releases. So, yes, the iPhone 7 does not have a headphone jack, but Apple is really trying to cushion the blow by including a set of earpods with a Lightning connector, and it's including a Lightning-to-3.5 mm headphone dongle. They both work well and sound just fine. The Lightning-to-headphone-jack adapter is $9 at the Apple store, and I think I'll be buying a few to keep on my favorite headphones. I'd rather keep them connected to my headphones than try to keep track of a loose dongle. The iPhone 7 and the 7 Plus look just like last year's 6S models, and it shows how smartphone design isn't exactly evolving, mostly because the current designs are just fine. Next year is the 10th anniversary of the iPhone, and the rumor is that Apple is holding off on a full-blown redo of the phone's design for the anniversary model. We shall see. So if they don't really look different, what's new in the iPhone 7 models? I've been carrying around a Verizon iPhone 7 for the last week, and I've been impressed. Faster Everyone loves a faster phone, and every iPhone has been faster than the one before it, so the iPhone 7 is twice as fast as the iPhone 6, which is great if you have an iPhone 5 or 6. I carry a 6S, and the 7 certainly felt fast, but once you get to a certain point, speed increases are just not as noticeable. The 7 uses a CPU called the A10 Fusion, which is tuned to provide up to two hours more battery life over last year's models. More battery life is always good. Apple says the 7's graphics performance is three times as fast as the iPhone 6's. Better cameras The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus have much better cameras than any previous iPhone, and the difference is startling. The iPhone 7 has a single-lens camera with an aperture of f/1.8, which is wide enough to bring out the best in low light. Photographing a darkened room with the 7 and a 6S shows just how much better the 7's new lens and sensor work together. The 7's lens allows 50 percent more light onto the sensor. The 7 uses a 12-megapixel sensor with optical image stabilization and a new feature, wide color capture, for more accurate colors. The camera's wide lens also helps videos look better. The 7 can shoot 4K video that looks fantastic. The selfie camera captures 7-megapixel images with wide color capture. Two is better than one Apple decided to reward buyers of the iPhone 7 Plus with a two-lens camera that rivals almost every point-and-shoot camera I've used. The wide-angle lens from the iPhone 7 is paired with a telephoto lens. They act as one when you're taking pictures. The iPhone 7 Plus lenses provide users a 2x optical zoom. The phone will automatically switch between the two lenses to capture the best image. The lenses also work together to provide up to a 10x digital zoom. During the phone's introduction, Apple showed off a shallow depth-of-field feature of the 7 Plus that blurs the background of portraits. The feature will be added soon with a software update. Both iPhone 7 models have a new quad-LED True Tone flash to help flash photos look more like natural light. Better display The iPhone 7 models have displays with wide color ranges to deliver more true-to-life colors. The 7 has a 4.7-inch LED with 3D Touch and a resolution of 1334 x 750 pixels, while the 7 Plus has a 5.5-inch 3D Touch display with a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels. Apple says the displays are 25 percent brighter than last year's phones. On the display is the familiar home button with Touch ID sensor, but the home button on the 7 is not a mechanical button. It is a touch button that doesn't physically move, but when you touch it, you'll feel a small vibration that feels like you're pushing a button. Audio Apple beefed up the speaker system on the iPhone 7 models, hoping we'll use them more for playing our music out loud. The sound system has been overhauled to be twice as loud as the 6S'. There are now two speakers -- one in the bottom of the phone near the Lightning port and one on the front where you'd put your ear for a phone call. The music I played through the 7 was loud enough, but such small speakers are not going to knock your socks off. The iPhone does continue to have an outstanding speakerphone. Water resistance Last year several customers made videos showing customers dunking their iPhone 6S phones. The phones on the videos still worked, but I'm sure the moisture sensors were tripped and the warranty voided. This year Apple is touting the water resistance of the iPhone 7 models. The phones are IP67 rated, which means they are dustproof and water-resistant, capable of surviving a dunk of up to 3 feet for up to 30 minutes. So your iPhone 7 and 7 Plus can survive an accidental dip in the pool, but don't take it swimming. LTE improvements Apple has upgraded the cellular radios in the iPhone 7s. They now can transfer data at 450 megabits per second, which is three times as fast as the iPhone 6 and twice as fast as the 6S. They've included support for 25 LTE bands and even opened up the phone app to allow third-party calling apps like WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger and others to be answered like a regular phone call. Pricing and storage The iPhone 7 comes in three configurations -- 32-gigabyte for $649, 128GB for $749 and 256GB for $849. The 7 Plus has the same storage options for $769, $869 and $969. The phones come in silver, gold, rose gold and two new black phones -- black (a matte black) and jet black (a shiny black). Space gray has been retired. The iPhone 7 models are available wherever you buy your phones, including all four major carriers and major retailers as well as Apple stores. The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus models are in short supply. Apple should have better inventory in a few weeks. Your best bet might be to order online from Apple. Conclusions After a year of carrying my iPhone 6S, the iPhone 7 felt like a well-worn shoe. I was comfortable from the beginning. I was completely impressed by the new camera system. From the first photo, I was quite aware of how much better the 7 handled low light. As a former news photographer, I'm thrilled with how Apple is advancing the cameras in the iPhone. I didn't find the lack of a headphone jack to be troublesome, but I can see where some might be upset. Better battery life and water resistance are welcome additions. I'd really like a dual-lens camera. The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus are great upgrades if you have an iPhone 6 or 5, but I'm an iPhone 6S owner who is going to wait. iPhone 7 Pros: Game-changing camera, more storage, water resistance Cons: That elusive headphone jack\ Bottom line: Best iPhone yet In this Collection...

With ten years of the iPhone closing in, many doubters thought Apple might be getting a little “boring.” While the iPhone 7’s design looks eerily similar to its two predecessors, there are enough changes here that make it the best iPhone to date. When I preordered the iPhone 7 (matte black), I decided to experiment a little by going back to the iPhone 5s from my iPhone 6s. I used it for a couple of days and came to a few conclusions. While I like the one handed use and form factor, the 4-inch screen was too small for my liking. I really missed the 4.7-inch screen real estate used for reading and watching videos so when I got my iPhone 7 a week later, I knew it was the perfect size phone for me. Headphone Jack Photo by Getty Images/Spencer Platt Let’s cut straight to the point, the lack of headphone jack will be a deal breaker for some people. While Apple isn’t the first company to remove the headphone jack from the mobile phone, they are getting pretty much all of the flack for doing so. With the headphone jack gone, Apple was able to move some components around and incorporate new things such as Optical Image Stabilization, stereo speaker, bigger battery, and even a second camera on the iPhone 7 Plus. Apple has removed many things in the past, most notably the optical and floppy drive, FireWire, and ethernet ports, and often to much criticism. But as time often shows, people move on and forget about the things Apple took away from their devices. One of the most common problems iPhone 7 users have is that they can’t listen to music and charge their phone at the same time since the EarPods/adapter utilized the lightning port. To get around this, Belkin has a dongle ($39.99) that will let you do this or use Apple’s Lightning Dock ($49). Not ideal—and it’s still a problem—but there is a way around this. I’ve had this phone for a week now and to be honest, I haven’t missed the headphone all that much at all. Apple did it right by including lightning EarPods and a lightning to 3.5mm adapter for your existing headphones. The only real inconvenience I came across is that while using the lightning EarPods, I couldn’t use them with my MacBook Pro since it didn’t have a lightning port. The only workaround was to carry around 3.5mm EarPods (or your choice of headphones) and use the included adapter. Again—not ideal. But looking ahead a few years, this is something that will go away as more and more products ditch the analogue audio jack. Design A quick glance will tell you that the iPhone 7’s design doesn’t look all that different from the previous two iterations. While the dimensions are the same, your old iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s cases won’t fit because the camera lens are larger so it won’t align with the cutouts on previous cases. The antenna lines have been moved to the top and bottom of the phone so it looks a bit more hidden and streamlined. However, you can barely notice it especially on the matte black and jet black versions. Despite the disappointment that we’ll have to wait until next year to get a true iPhone redesign, it’s hard to fault Apple when its device looks this good and feels this good in the hand. The only real complaint here is with the “Jet Black” version, which has a glossy finish across the case and is a serious fingerprint magnet. As much as we are all excited for what Apple does with the 10th anniversary iPhone next year, you most likely won’t hear complaints from the average consumer, who all love their iPhones anyways. Hardware The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus both have the A10 Fusion chip that, according to speed tests, is faster even than the 9.7-inch iPad Pro. Even though the iPhone 6s was fast already, the iPhone 7 is noticeably faster especially when launching apps like Snapchat where you might be trying to capture a moment quickly. The chip has four cores—two for high performance and two for efficiency saving you precious battery life. Speaking of battery life, Apple says the new iPhone 7 has one to two extra hours of battery but in my weeklong testing, it was closer to the one hour mark, which is still pretty crucial. The display shows a wider range of colors to support the upgraded cameras but still has a 1334 × 750 pixel resolution, which is low compared to competitors like the Samsung Galaxy S7 (2560 × 1440 pixels). The wider color gamut looks better and increases the brightness by 25%. The Taptic Engine exudes more haptic feedback throughout iOS, which I like a lot, when doing things like ticking an option on/off, pull down to refresh in some apps, scrolling through items like setting an alarm, etc. Apple is also including the APU for developers to take advantage of the Taptic Engine so they can incorporate taptic feedback in games and other apps. Another new feature of the iPhone 7 are the speakers. The speakers are much louder now with an additional speaker on top, which utilizes the earpiece you use for phone calls. It is two times louder than the ones on the iPhone 6s and like the speakers on the iPad Pro, it senses when the phone is being viewed in landscape mode and adjusts the sound output accordingly. While playing music and podcasts through the speakers, the sound is noticeably louder, but it does not distort it in any way. Home Button Aside from the headphone jack, the new Home button was another talking point on the new iPhones. It is now a solid state button so it is essentially a stationary piece of glass and is no longer mechanical so it doesn’t click like its older counterparts. This is to help improve water resistance because the home button is essentially not a button anymore and is less prone to break down and get flimsy over time. The Taptic Engine vibrates every time you “press” on the button to give you feedback (you can adjust the settings to light, medium and firm). It kind of reminds me of the faux buttons on my old Nexus One screen where the buttons came up on the screen only when needed and it vibrated every time I pushed them. This along with the Raise to Wake feature, I believe Apple will remove the home button all together in the near future. Water Resistance One feature that is much welcomed to the new iPhone is water resistance. Apple touts the new iPhone 7 has a IP67 rating, which means it is dust resistance and will not breakdown to a depth of one meter for more than 30 minutes. So you can say goodbye to the days of putting your soaked iPhone in a bag of rice hoping it will turn on again the next day. While it is water resistant, I would not recommend taking it for a swim even in the shallow end and DO NOT expose it to salt water because it will start to eat away at the components. Also note that Apple will not cover any iPhones that are water damaged even if you have AppleCare and wait up to five hours before charging a wet iPhone. However, you don’t have to worry about taking your phone out in the rain, spilling a little water on it while at a restaurant, or even dropping it in the toilet. For this review, I ran some water over it in a sink and even took it in the shower with me to listen to a podcast and in both instances, it came out fine. Camera Both cameras on the iPhone 7 have been upgraded from the iPhone 6s. The rear camera is now a 12 megapixel camera with a larger f/1.8 aperture letting in more light. The front-facing camera is now a 7-megapixel camera, which is a much needed improvement considering how selfies are a huge thing nowadays. Along with that, it has a six element lens allowing it to capture a wider color range for more vibrant and detailed pictures and the smaller iPhone has optical image stabilization for still pictures and videos whereas it was reserved only for the larger iPhone 6s Plus in the past. The True Tone flash has also been updated to four LEDs resulting in a 50% brighter and farther reaching flash. And yes, if you’ve seen the pictures, the “camera bump” is still there and it’s even bigger than last year’s model but Apple has built it into the bezel so it is more natural looking. When taking pictures especially night shots, more details show up than ever before. Lastly, you also get a bokeh effect, built into the Camera app, as shown above. Just select “Portrait” and you’ll see the camera grab onto a close subjective and blur the background. And if you are lucky enough to get your hands on the iPhone 7 Plus, the dual cameras make it a dream for amateur (and even professional) photographers since it is the camera that people have with them at all times. With the 7 Plus, you get an optical zoom, which means you’ll finally get a zoom that isn’t terribly blurry. But even with just the 7, you’re still getting a significant camera update that pushes the iPhone back into that coveted number one spot for best smartphone camera. The Galaxy Note 7 and Galaxy S7 are still great cameras, but Apple’s newest batches of cameras are hard to beat, especially in lowlight situations. Software The design of the phone might not feel all that different, but iOS 10 makes some substantial changes to how your phone feels and functions. There aren’t many iPhone-specific features, but that doesn’t mean the overall smartphone experience still isn’t one of the very best you can get. There are a ton of new features—and we won’t get into all of them right now—but most of the basic apps got updates, including Maps, Photos, and Apple Music. Control Center also got an update, along with notifications and how you interact with them. Apple still hasn’t completely figured out notifications, but with each update they get better and better. The lock screen is where you’ll notice more significant changes though. iOS now has widgets from third party apps, as well as shortcuts to your most used apps. It’s all done in iOS’s attractive clean style and Apple has done a good job of not letting all the information make your phone look to cluttered. The biggest change though is to iMessage, which has gone from standard text messaging app to a Facebook Messenger competitor. There are all sorts of new ways to communicate, most of which are silly and fun. But helpful features like support for rich links and playable YouTube videos (without leaving the app), actually make iMessage feel like a legitimate messaging app. Configurations Photo by Getty Images/Gonzalo Arroyo Moreno/Stringer The 16GB iPhone is now gone from existence! But I have some bad news for you, 32GB is the new 16GB. I opted for the 32GB version and while i have about 60 songs saved offline on Apple Music, no movies, most of my photos and videos backed up on Google Photos, I was left with about 8GB of free space. I tend to shoot a lot of video and if I wanted to shoot 4K, I wouldn’t have that much space to do so. With people taking more pictures and videos, I can see why even the 32GB model would be a problem with a lot of people. In fact, I am regretting not shelling out an extra $100 for the 128GB version. On a side note, one solution that I have been talking about for a while is that we need a way to clear caches from apps like Snapchat, Instagram, and Twitter where pictures and videos may take up more than a gig of space especially if you are following a lot of people and/or using the apps a lot. While the increase in storage doesn’t have an effect for the iPhone 7 (32GB; $649, 128GB; $749, 256GB; $849), there is a $20 increase for each model of the iPhone 7 Plus ($769, $869, $969). Verdict Like Apple says, the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus are the best iPhones out there right now. I was skeptical about the headphone jack at first and was dissuaded from even pre-ordering at first but I went through with it and am very glad I did so. Aside from the speed and performance, the camera upgrade especially the optical image stabilization was a huge welcome since it was reserved for the Plus models last year. I can see this being a huge hidden factor for the average user because you don’t know how great it is until you re-watch the footage and see how smooth it is. I will gladly give up the headphone jack in exchange for a better camera, battery life, and performance and I’m sure most iPhone 7 users will agree. If the headphone jack is that important to you, then you’re in luck because the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus are still great phones. There is a wide range of iPhones out there that will suit everyone’s needs, that’s why Apple released the iPhone SE. There were a group of consumers who still loved the smaller 4-inch screen so instead of forcing them to get larger iPhones, they updated it so those people could enjoy better performance, cameras, etc. If you have a 6s and are on the fence, don’t do it unless you really want the new camera features. If it doesn’t really matter, hold on to it. If you have a 6 or older and don’t care about the headphone jack, then upgrade because you’ll notice the improvements right away. The iPhone 7 probably won’t convince Android users to switch over, but it will surely please the hordes of people who love their iPhones.

A disgruntled customer in France entered an Apple Store in Dijon yesterday and calmly smashed devices in front of Apple staff and customers. At least 10 iPhones were smashed with a boule metal ball (used in a French bowls game), alongside a MacBook Air. French media reports suggest the angry man, who actually calmly smashed devices, was complaining about his consumer rights and a refund. The man appears to have been detained outside the store, and there are no reports of injuries apart from the broken Apple equipment. Hopefully the angry man purchased multiple AppleCare protection plans, otherwise that's going to be a costly bill for thousands of dollars of property damage. iPhone 7 and 7 Plus review Via: 9to5Mac Source: Le Bien Public Next Up In Circuit Breaker Researchers send text message using chemicals This Panasonic megaphone automatically translates commands into multiple languages Amazon is rolling out Alexa-only shopping deals Apple launches repair program for iPhone 6 Plus ‘touch disease’ flaw Google's new Pixel phone case will put the day's news where you can't avoid it Star Wars drones are coming to the US just in time for the holiday toy hunger games Now Trending Microsoft Surface Studio review: a beautiful invader of Apple's base Sand's End Trump’s chief strategist Steve Bannon suggests having too many Asian tech CEOs undermines ‘civic society’ This Article has a component height of 6.

By Tess Koman Sep 30, 2016 A man was arrested after angrily smashing thousands of dollars' worth of Apple products in a Dijon, France, Apple store, Fortune reports. In a series of videos, he can be heard yelling about a reimbursement he didn’t receive, though it’s unclear why he believes he deserved one. According to France Bleu, the man, who is reportedly 30 years old but has not yet been identified, used a petanque ball (a small steel ball used in the French game of boules) to smash the products — the ball can be seen in his hand as he methodically goes through the store crushing at least 10 screens.

He tells everyone in the store it’s their right to do the same and gives one person filming a thumbs up. Because Apple didn’t reimburse him (again, it’s unclear what for), “this is what happens.” After what seems like forever, he's greeted by security on the way out of the store. Apple apologized and revoked its latest iOS upgrade as a way of settling the issue, but the man is still reportedly pissed. Kidding — Apple has yet to comment and charges are reportedly being considered. Follow Tess on Twitter.

By Corazon Victorino On 09/30/16 AT 6:01 PM Close As a global company, nothing is stopping Apple from bringing its products to other countries. But as it heads to South Korea to bring to the country its iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus handsets, should Samsung really be worried? On Friday, Cult of Mac found out that three South Korean mobile providers have confirmed that they are to start selling the new iPhones this October, specifically starting Oct. 21, in the Galaxy Note 7 maker’s home country.  Local reports from the Asian country state that Apple Korea’s homepage and the three providers are going to release the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus once they get the Cupertino giant’s final approval. This is definitely bad timing for Samsung, since it is still in the throes of its global recall that is said to cost $1 billion as it replaces all 2.5 million units that were shipped since it officially released the Galaxy Note 5 successor, as previously reported by Bloomberg.  Related Stories China Accuses Samsung Of Recall ‘Discrimination’ Samsung Admits It Has ‘Exploding’ Washing Machines Samsung Acquires License For Hydrophobic Smartphone Display Another Galaxy Note 7 Explodes In New Incident Report Samsung Galaxy Note 7 Replacement Still Problematic? Cult of Mac says this is also not looking great for the South Korea giant because the younger generation of smartphone users were found to prefer Apple’s iPhones over Samsung’s handsets based on a recent poll.  Previously, Apple’s iPhone 6 held around 33 percent of the South Korean market share when it was at the peak of its popularity. Currently, Apple’s market share is at around 20 percent. With the arrival of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, the figure is expected to go higher, which should make Samsung nervous at this point, according to Patently Apple.  Analysts claim that 2017 isn’t looking that great for Samsung either, since cheap Android smartphones from its competitors are also penetrating its home country. Korea Economic Research Institute senior researcher Chung Hei-sang recently said, "The law to restrict phone subsidies, which makes it difficult for Samsung and LG difficult to cut costs, has opened more door for foreign low-budget phones to enter the local market." To top it all off, there’s this Apple’s plan to put up its first Apple retail store possibly just across the street where Samsung’s headquarters is situated in South Korea’s capital city, Seoul.   Join the Discussion Most Read Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.

Screenshots are disabled due to the fact that the screenshot-taking shortcut overlaps functionality used by the Workout app. In watchOS 3, it’s possible to stop and start in-progress workouts by pressing the Digital Crown and Side button simultaneously. It just so happens that this is the exact same gesture used to take Apple Watch screenshots. To enable screenshots on your Apple Watch running watchOS 3, simply do the following: Step 1: Launch the Watch app on your paired iPhone. Step 2: On the My Watch tab go to General and turn on the Enable Screenshots switch. Once enabled, you can now take screenshots by pressing the Digital Crown and Side button at the same time. Your Apple Watch screenshots are saved directly to the iPhone Camera Roll for easy retrieval. Video walkthrough Want more videos? Subscribe to 9to5Mac’s YouTube channel How to make Apple Watch screenshots look better Apple Watch screenshots aren’t the most beautiful looking things in the world by default, but there are ways to make these screenshots look better. LongScreen ($2.99 on App Store) has long been my go-to app of choice for spiffying up iPhone and iPad screenshots, and the same principle applies to Apple Watch screenshots. This app is absolutely fundamental to my workflow, and comes with a sterling recommendation. Seriously, just buy LongScreen and thank me later. Step 1: Launch LongScreen. Step 2: Tap the Filter button in the upper left-hand corner and select your Apple Watch type (38 or 42mm). Step 3: Select one or more Apple Watch screenshots. These screenshots can be grouped vertically or horizontally using the options at the top of the screen. Step 4: Tap the Merge button in the upper right-hand corner Step 5: Tap the magic wand button at the bottom of the screen, and enable the Rounded corner switch. Alternatively, you can select the Space Grey or Silver Apple Watch models for added flair. Step 6: Tap the Share button in the bottom left-hand corner to save or export your screenshot.

Crunch Network Apple is screwing up HomeKit; here’s how they can fix it Posted Sep 30, 2016 by Daniel Conrad 0 SHARES Next Story Nutanix up 131% on first day of trading Daniel Conrad Crunch Network Contributor Daniel is co-founder of Beep Networks, and was an early product manager on Google's Android and Access teams. More posts by this contributor: Three reasons carriers are building new cell networks for the Internet of Things How to join the network The real magic of the Internet of Things happens when devices work together. It will be magic when Siri, on your iPhone, can adjust your thermostat or confirm that you locked the back door; when your door lock can tell your sound system you’re home and you don’t even have to push a button to start the music. That’s not the reality we live in today, because most devices can’t talk to each other. Without a common language, this magic can’t happen. Apple (through HomeKit) and Google (through Works with Nest) have introduced programs to enable this type of communication. As owners of the two dominant mobile phone platforms, they are both well-positioned to set standards for in-home device communication. And yet, Works with Nest adoption is light years ahead of HomeKit. Looking at the numbers: Apple’s website currently boasts HomeKit-compatible devices from 7 manufacturers. The Works with Nest page shows 95. Nest connects to washing machines, pet feeders and baby monitors. HomeKit works with Philips lights and not much else. Apple’s been making devices for a long time. They’re in a lot more homes than Nest, and their retail stores should give them a tremendous advantage in attracting partners. Also, connecting to iPhone should be easy. So why does Nest have an order of magnitude more device partners? Hardware is slow, software is fast The fundamental difference in approach is one of hardware versus software. Apple requires hardware integration. Nest does integrations in the cloud. Our team built one of the first devices that connected to Nest. The integration and certification test process took one engineer a few days to complete. Nearly everything happens in the cloud, not on the user’s local Wi-Fi network. It didn’t hurt that we were well-supported by the team at Nest, or that their documentation is publicly available and excellent. Or that Firebase is awesome. (Google actually acquired Firebase — maybe just to make Works With Nest even better?) Apple does things totally differently. You have to apply for access to the MFi developer program to even look at the documentation for HomeKit hardware integration. Seriously, you have to wait weeks for approval just to read the HomeKit device requirements. Apple requires an authentication chip be added to your hardware that you can only buy from them. Existing products can not be connected to HomeKit without this change to their electrical design. It’s like in a world with email, they’re asking us to use a fax machine. You also have to build your product with one of their approved manufacturers. If your current manufacturer is not on the list, you must move your line to a new factory. You have to test and certify your device in one of Apple’s approved labs. I understand there are only a few of them  —  a friend here in San Francisco had to send his devices to the U.K. for testing. I’ve even heard that Apple reviews your packaging to make sure the colors don’t clash with their branding schemes. I’m honestly choosing not to believe that that’s true —  but maybe it is. Integrations belong in the cloud Most importantly, Apple requires much of the device-to-device integration to happen on the local Wi-Fi network  —  rather than talk to servers, your device talks to an iPhone through the local Wi-Fi network, and the iPhone talks to the other devices. That means that HomeKit logic must be baked into the firmware on the device itself, and any future modifications or extensions of the system mean updating that firmware. This is not how it’s supposed to work in the days of the internet. Devices should be connected to the cloud. In the cloud, servers can talk to each other. We can fix bugs without risky over-the-air firmware updates. To be clear, there is a place for non-cloud connections between devices. We used to ship a music synchronization device, and the low-latency communications we needed required local communication. Nest offers the Weave platform for local communication between devices, too. Bluetooth devices can’t connect to a Wi-Fi access point, so they need to communicate with a phone directly. But there’s no reason to require integration at the device level when you can do it in the cloud. This is nuts It’s strange to me that Apple can get this so wrong. It’s like in a world with email, they’re asking us to use a fax machine. Related Articles Apple works to fit the smart home under a single roof Why Apple wants to be the smart home's nerve center Here's How To Use Siri Commands On iOS Devices With HomeKit Accessories My first thought is that they might want to limit the quantity of devices to improve the average quality. If they make it expensive enough, maybe only the best devices will get through. The Amazon reviews on First Alert’s HomeKit smoke detector suggest otherwise. In today’s day and age it’s often not the rich companies building the best devices. Maybe it’s just that Apple fundamentally still thinks like a hardware company. That is, when they think of integrations, they instinctively begin with lists of hardware requirements. Whatever their goal, the end result is that HomeKit is going to fail unless Apple changes its approach. I hope they do. God knows Nest could use a healthy competitor. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase HomeKit Description HomeKit is a framework in iOS 8 for communicating with and controlling connected accessories in a user’s home.

(Photo: Tomohiro Ohsumi/Getty Images) The iPad Air 3 is rumored to launch in the first quarter of 2017. Reports have hinted that the upcoming Apple tablet will be an affordable device with a high-resolution display, updated Bluetooth and Lightning ports. The iPad Mini 5 is also slated to arrive next year. Apple is said to lower the prices of the iPad Air 3 to expand Apple's budget-friendly options, The Reporter Times reported. Rumor has it that the lower price tag is due to the decrease in sales in the table market. Additionally, the iPad Air 3 will reportedly roll out with a price range of $390 to $590. However, it is expected that if the release date is postponed to the end of next year, then the cost of the device may be further reduced. The iPad 3 is rumored to have a 9.7 inch screen with 2,048 x 1,536 screen resolution. The device is slated to be sleeker and more durable than previous installments and will include a fingerprint scanner, Bluetooth 4.2 as well as Lightning ports. The table is also rumored to run on the upgraded A9 chipset that will provide users with faster device performance and power efficiency. The new tablet will include a 4GB RAM with either 64 GB, 128 GB, or 256 GB internal storage. The device will have a 12MP camera which is higher than the iPad Air 2's and the iPad Pro's 8MP snapper. The device is rumored to feature 3D Touch Screen like the iPhone 6S Plus. Likewise, the iPad Mini may also roll out without a 3.5mm headphone jack for that wireless audio experience. The iPad Air 3 and the iPad Mini 5 are the two Apple devices slated for next year. The former is expected to roll out with color option Gold, Silver, Space Gray and possibly Rose Gold, PC Advisor reported. In other news, the iPad Mini 5 had not been revealed in the Apple event last Sept. 7. Rumor has it that the device will have to wait out until the first quarter of 2017 possibly in March. However, it is said that the device will not be introduced as the iPad Mini 5 but a mini version of the iPad Pro to be called an iPad Pro Mini 5.   TagsiPad Air 3, iPad Air 3 news, iPad Air 3 update, iPad Air 3 specs, iPad Air 3 features, iPad Air 3 price, iPad Air 3 release date, iPad Air 3 rumors Related Articles Samsung Galaxy A7 Release Date, News & Update: 1st-Ever Device To Sport 8MP+ Fro ...

TechRadar The source for Tech Buying Advice Search RSS Reviews How To Phones TVs Laptops Deals Photography More Car Tech Wearables Tablets Components Audiovisual Gaming Computing Downloads News Pro Trending MacBook Pro Nintendo Switch Google Pixel iOS 10.1 PS4 Pro Early Black Friday Deals News Your Mac simply wouldn't be the same without the iPhone – here's why Your Mac simply wouldn't be the same without the iPhone – here's why By Joe Osborne Apple   The iPhone's influence on the Mac is palpable Shares When the iPhone first launched nearly a decade ago, it and Apple's well-revived Mac computers were clearly delineated as different devices. One had just started its journey to ubiquity, whereas the other had already been on that road for decades. But, perhaps even under your nose, Apple's phone has all but morphed the form and function of its computers over that same nine years. You might be surprised to see just how much of what's in your iPhone has been brought to the Mac. Today, it'd be impossible to imagine what the Mac would look like without the iPhone, so here's how the Mac and iPhone became best buds over the past nine years. This story starts with a Store Not long after release, the iPhone's popularity absolutely exploded, it became the next major device of Apple's ecosystem for millions since the iPod. Once the App Store launched on iPhone in 2008, that snowball turned into an avalanche. Naturally, Apple realized the insane revenue potential in its creation. Regardless, it took three years for the firm to bring its software-selling strategy to the Mac in early 2011, in the middle of Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard's life span. While the Mac App Store hasn't necessarily panned out in the same, meteoric way the iPhone version has, it clearly inspired Apple to see what else about the iPhone could improve OS X. The literal and figurative Launchpad In the summer of 2011, Apple launched OS X 10.7 Lion, and with it the first spate of iPhone-inspired features that would truly transform how the operating system looks and works in relation to the iPhone. The most notable of which was the Launchpad, a new means of accessing all your installed apps. Either pressing the function key on MacBooks released post-Lion or pinching four fingers together on the touchpad summons a very familiar arrangement of apps for anyone that's used an iPad in landscape mode. From there, simply clicking on any app will launch it, and you can even rearrange your apps here and create folders – just like you can on iOS. While this editor in particular hasn't used the feature much, being a purist, it's easy to see folks coming into the Apple world via the iPhone using the feature heavily. That probably explains why it hasn't gone anywhere in five years. FaceTime forever fuses the iPhone and Mac For years prior to OS X Lion, Mac users communicated with one another both via text and video over a tool known as iChat. Naturally, seeing the vast adoption of FaceTime video chat on the iPhone and iPad, Apple brought the feature to the Mac, so that all three devices could video chat natively together. However, FaceTime didn't outright replace iChat just yet – it wasn't until OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion in the summer of 2012 that the tool was swapped out for an app simply called Messages. Now, users could chat via instant message, video and even with their iPhone-toting friends via iMessage in a single app. This release of OS X also saw a slew of iOS-inspired changes and updates. A Mac version of the iPhone's Notification Center appeared with this upgrade, as did versions of Reminders, Notes and Game Center – all of which started on iPhone and now synced with those versions via your Apple ID. At this point, Apple's Mac interface strategy was clear: give the Mac the same basic functions and tools as the iPhone, but in such a way that's useful to Mac users and connects them back to their smartphones wherever possible. But, that ethos would too evolve in due time. Mavericks begins to morph the UI For a long time, the Mac interface was both adored and abhorred for its skeuomorphic approach to design, i.e. icons and design elements that look like their real-world counterparts. For instance, the Calendar app looked like an actual calendar on your Mac screen, complete with stitching and leather textures. This editor in particular had always been quite fond of it, but it was with 2013's OS X Mavericks that Apple decided it was time to bring the Mac interface's design identity closer to that of its iOS products. The Calendar app lost its stitching and the Notes app lost its paper-like texture – and that's just for starters. Apple's very own, iPhone-born Maps app made it over to the Mac with this release as well as iBooks, with all of the syncing and iOS-style trappings (with widened Mac functionality) that users had come to expect by that point. And today, the two are inseparable Releases following Mavericks, namely OS X 10.10 Yosemite of 2014, saw these design identity tweaks turn into a full-blown overhaul coinciding with a similar shift on iOS. The charming if divisive skeuomorphs were no more, and Apple bolstered that visual continuity with functional continuity in an eponymous suite of tools. Continuity made the union of iPhone and Mac even stronger, allowing users to answer calls coming in from their iPhone on their Mac device, more readily use the iPhone as a Wi-Fi hotspot as well as take content from Apple's iWork apps on iOS and finish working on it in their OS X counterparts. This release also marked the merging of yet another iPhone app with an OS X version in iOS's Photos app replacing the Mac's storied iPhoto app, and marrying the two together with a shared library of photos over iCloud. By the time OS X 10.11 El Capitan arrived just last year in 2015, if you owned both an iPhone and a Mac, you were working in both iOS and OS X simultaneously without even knowing it. And today, with a (truncated) return in name to macOS Sierra, Apple has finally forges the last missing link between the iPhone and the Mac: Siri. But, in the spirit of all of the Mac's iPhone-inspired upgrades, Siri behaves in ways on Mac that it doesn't on iPhone. For instance, Siri on Mac can retrieve your system's files based on natural search queries – it can't do that on iPhone. Another example is its ability to store your results in the Mac's version of the Notification Center for later retrieval or click and drag results into other documents. For Pete's sake, you can now even copy a piece of text or a photo on your iPhone and paste it on a nearby Mac with the Universal Clipboard feature. See what we mean about working on two operating systems without even knowing it? Since the iPhone launched back in 2007, it has influenced the development of the Mac in almost every way – to the point where it's impossible to imagine what the Mac would be like had the iPhone never been released. How else will the iPhone continue to inspire the Mac? That's a question only Apple knows the answer to in truth, but if we could suggest something: blow that Universal Clipboard wide open.

 YOUR E-MAIL VERIFICATION CODE One of the biggest Turkish film festivals outside Turkey, the Frankfurt Turkish Films Festival, kicks off for the 16th time with its enlarged program Organized for the 16th time in Germany's city of Frankfurt, the Golden Apple Turkish Films Festival kicked off with an opening ceremony last night. The festival, which was supported by Turkey's Minister of Foreign Affairs and Culture and Tourism Ministry, Turkey's Embassy to Frankfurt, Municipality of Frankfurt, Turkish Airlines and the Turkish Radio and Television Corporation (TRT), attracted nearly 6,000 audiences last year. The 16th edition of the Turkish Films Festival in Frankfurt will continue until Oct. 5. This year, the 16th Frankfurt Turkish Films Festival takes place with its theme "The World of Labor" and will host screenings of roughly 50 feature-length, short and documentary films. One of the many objectives of the festival is to organize panel and Q & A sessions within the frames of the films that are featured in the festival program to bring the locals of the festival into the spotlight with the Turkish filmmakers and create the necessary environment to establish new friendships and exchange cultures, triggering communities to live together peacefully. This year's Golden Apple Frankfurt Turkish Film Festival Honorary Awards will be presented to Güngör Bayrak, Murat Soydan and Talat Bulut. On the other hand, the Audience Award, which is presented to the most watched film of the year, will be granted to "Çinçin Bağları" (Çinçin Vineyard), directed by Emre Budak. Veteran Turkish actor Zeki Alasya, who passed away in 2015, will be commemorated with the Loyalty Award. As part of the 16th Golden Apple Frankfurt Turkish Films Festival, the "Feature Film Competition," "Short Film Competition," "Best Script," "Best Music," "Best Actress," "Best Actor," "Best Director of Cinematography" and "Turkish Films from the View of German Film Makers" competition will be held. The "Short Film Competition" jury is composed of Professor Selma Köksal Çekiç, Arda Erdikmen, Cem Başeskioğlu, Fırat Sayıcı, Gamze İlkılınç and Mehmet Erduğan and the "Feature-length Film Festival," which is chaired by Yüksel Yalova, is composed of Hale Soygazi, İsmail Güneş, Özgür Şeyben, Oya Doğan, Banu Bozdemir and Nurdan Sever. Speaking to the press, Hüseyin Sıtkı, the Festival chair, said the festival only hosted the guests who were related to the featured films during the first years; however, now, the festival organizes screenings in three different categories. In the first category, the festival screens the feature-length, short and documentary films from Turkey. Short films and documentaries by Turkish-decedent German filmmakers such as Fatih Akın and Ayşe Polat are screened in the second category, while films that are registered in the European Films Forum are screened in the third category. Furthermore, five European films focusing on labor are featured in the festival program. As a part of the festival, exhibitions, panel sessions and workshops are to be held. This year, the festival committee also initiated new projects titled "Festival at Schools" and "Festivals at Prisons." Through these projects, the festival films will be screened for high school students and a total of 500 prisoners at the Frankfurt Prison. The 16th Frankfurt Turkish Films Festival has enlarged its area of influence and has begun to screen festival films outside of Frankfurt. "Abluka (Frenzy), "Çırak" (Apprentice), "Kalandar Soğuğu" (Cold of Kalandar), "Kar Korsanları" (Snow Pirates), "Merdiven Baba" (Stair Dad), "Misafir" (Guest), "Saklı" (Hidden), "Sarmaşık" (Ivy), "Toz Bezi" (Dust Cloth) and Yarım (Half) compete for "Best Feature Film," while Abluka," "Kalandar Soğuğu," "Kar Korsanları," "Sarmaşık" and "Yarım" compete for "Best Script." Emin Alper with "Abluka," Emre Konuk with "Çırak," Mustafa Kara with "Kalandar Soğuğu," Faruk Hacıhafızoğlu with "Kar Korsanları" and Tolga Karaçelik with "Sarmaşık" compete for the "Best Director" award. While Nuray Yeşilaraz, Şenay Gürler, Türkü Turan, Nazan Kesal and Asiye Dinçsoy compete for "Best Actress," Mehmet Özgür, Haydar Şişman, İnanç Konukçu, Nadir Sarıbacak and Serhat Yiğit are the nominees for "Best Actor."

In a series of videos posted on YouTube, the unidentified man calmly walks around the store while slamming a pétanque metal ball – used in the French lawn bowling game – into the devices. "Apple is a company that violated European consumers' rights. They refused to reimburse me, I told them: 'Give me my money back'. They said no. So you know what's happening?

visit my web shop » Dappled Apple comments: 35 September 30, 2016 | Filed in: Baking and Cooking, Portland and Oregon Apple picking with Mimi, just the two of us, yesterday. The apples were high in the trees, and small. I love apple trees. The air was cool and dry, the noonday sun dusky and golden. After about an hour she said, "Mom, let's go home," and I had been thinking the exact same thing. The drive through the country was long and sweet. We talked and sang. We're almost never, ever home by 2:00 p.m., but yesterday we were. I peeled and chopped apples while she stirred in the sink and filled it with apple peels and mountains of dish-soap bubbles (a cheap thrill I encourage). Applesauce simmered on the stove. The house smelled like cinnamon. Today I bought an autumn door wreath, little fake red apples on dried grapevine. I knew she'd like it, and she does. It will remind me of yesterday. Xoxoxoxo. Thaaaaaaaank you for all of your great comments on my last post. Because of them I decided to chill psychologically the way I was already, in spite of myself or my to-dos, chilling physically. It's taking longer than I thought it would to find my motivation to do my chores, or much of anything else, but I'm down with it. I am knitting and knitting and knitting and knitting! I can't believe how much I am knitting. Last weekend we went to the Oregon Flock and Fiber Festival with Amelia's birthgrandfather and -grandmother, who is a spinner and knitter. She made me the most gorgeous shawl for Mother's Day, using fiber from last year's festival that she spun and knit in lovely, natural shades. I need to take a photo of it, and luckily it's finally getting chilly enough that I'll be able to wear it soon. We've all gone to the festival together for the last three years, and though I don't often find yarn for myself there (there is more fleece than yarn available to buy, I think) I do come away so inspired. Sometimes I think I just want to do nothing but knit. I've been knitting so much I haven't even taken the time to photograph the things I have knit. This gorgeous, russety weather won't last, so there will be time (though perhaps no gorgeous, russety light). 35 comments bonnie says: September 30, 2016 at 02:13 PM you had me at "russety." happiest autumn to you and yours ~ CJ says: September 30, 2016 at 02:29 PM Yes, the light is gorgeous right now isn't it. The apples look just perfect in it. It's the time of year for knitting I think. I loved reading the comments on your last post too, I found them very reassuring! Wishing you and yours a good weekend Alicia. CJ xx Qalballah says: September 30, 2016 at 02:38 PM Goodness, your baby girl looks like a character straight out of a picture book about autumn here! Lovely light we're getting now. monique says: September 30, 2016 at 03:10 PM She is so magnetic!♥ And your photos are too. rc says: September 30, 2016 at 03:13 PM When did your little baby girl turn in to a big girl! That one photo of her looking back. Whoa! Gorgeous photos, as usual. I didn't comment on the last post but yes, it's ok to take things slow. Enjoy the peace and quiet. There's not a lot of it these days. :D Karen Budnick says: September 30, 2016 at 04:14 PM These lovely, warm Autumn days are getting shorter so enjoy every second. Your photos are lovely, your prose is like a refreshing cup of tea. And now you've made me think about apples. I just heard about making apple butter in a crockpot. I've never even bought a jar of it but I want the house to smell like yours looks Maybe I'll even put it up for Christmas gifts. Another project for the list...mine, not yours! Jane says: September 30, 2016 at 04:21 PM ...those legs...how did they get so long?!?!?! sharon stanley says: September 30, 2016 at 04:27 PM it makes me uber happy to see these pics with their autumn feel and light. it's so encouraging to know it's fall somewhere! our september, much like our august has been hot, humid and unseasonably green. i yearn for the orange, yellow and red of fall. i am amazed at how grown up amelia is since starting her school...she's grown 6 inches at least! so sweet and so fetching in her seasonal clothes. Teresa Kasner says: September 30, 2016 at 05:06 PM I really enjoyed the images in this post.. so Autumnal.. I need to get some photos of the apples on our tree.. pears too. I so wish I'd seen you at the OFFF.. I'd really like to say hello to you in person some day. Although I feel like you're a friend even though we've never been face to face. :-) Now I want to make apple sauce. ((hugs)), Teresa :-) Joy says: September 30, 2016 at 06:22 PM I want to make apple 🍎 crumble now x Linda says: September 30, 2016 at 06:23 PM Big girl legs! My goodness the time passes too fast. Fibre Festivals...so fun and yes, so inspiring. Love those copper kitchen lamps. Love the apple with the little bite too. Thanks for this. Laurie Drew says: September 30, 2016 at 08:31 PM Amelia is looking SO mature! She didn't just grow this summer, she's looking like a young lady. cynthia says: September 30, 2016 at 08:51 PM i love love love that mimi walks so much. as a child in chicago, we walked everywhere. we romped through axehead lake by o'hare and thatcher woods, you know where. :>)) what a brilliant young lady she has become. tomorrow is 01 october. my birth month, as well as meems'. what a perfectly smashing choice for her top at the orchard. i love the expression in 'apples 11'. as always, a beautiful post. thank you, alicia. Pam says: October 01, 2016 at 05:51 AM Despite it being the second month of Spring here in South Australia, we are still experiencing deepest wintry weather. I mention this because I too have had a crazy upsurge in knitting and now wonder how I had let it go to a level of around only one project completed every two years or so. Since May I have knitted my daughter a cardigan, hat and boot toppers and four scarves for me. Now working on another cardigan for my daughter. Have also started a knitting club at the school where I teach and have 'Knit a Row and Go' bags set up in the stateroom where staff are communally knitting on scarves and rug squares to give to charity in break times. Yes, I too could just sit and knit and knit and knit, christie says: October 01, 2016 at 06:04 AM Seeing your blog pop up on my screen always brightens my mornings. Knit, knit, knit... being retired I am lucky enough to have the time and certainly the desire. Downside is that once an avid reader I rarely pick up a book - always go for my needles instead! Your sewing is amazing and you also KNIT, cook and lovingly raise that adorable girl. Good for you! Lynn says: October 01, 2016 at 06:15 AM Oh, how I love your posts! Enjoy your knitting and beautiful girl. Life comes in seasons. I love how you are enjoying each one to the fullest and sharing it with us. You always make me smile and remember when my now 20 somethings were babies and how much fun we had. Thank you for bringing beauty to this crazy world!! Lynne says: October 01, 2016 at 06:37 AM Apple day's delight . . . Love this time of the year . . . If it would only stop rainy . . . Julie says: October 01, 2016 at 06:43 AM I am starting to plan my knitting projects, getting excited as the days get cooler. I love all of the photos you share-thank you for that! And I love that copper lamp your kitchen, have to try and find one for me! Robin says: October 01, 2016 at 06:54 AM Beautiful pictures. Your sweet girl reminds me so much of the illustrations in the Eloise Wilkin illustrated Little Golden Books. So beautiful. Thanks for sharing. Lacy says: October 01, 2016 at 12:17 PM A girl's day out ~ perfect. Yum, applesauce. Did you add cinnamon candies to turn it pink & spicy? ❤️ I thought I heard the sound of knitting needles humming right along. Good for you, this is the best time of year for knitting. I'm knitting right along with you. Seems I just can't knit fast enough in order to finish all the patterns I want to knit. 😍 I so look forward to the Oregon Flock & Fiber every year. We must encourage you to try your hand at spinning. I just know you'd like it. And if you ever do there's a new book on the market that is perfect for the beginner to the expert. https://smile.amazon.com/dp/1612125212/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_ttl?_encoding=UTF8&colid=JIN2B4LL9TRP&coliid=I3KJ2M09TSBH5R And while I'm here there is also another fun book you might enjoy.📚 https://smile.amazon.com/dp/163217068X/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_ttl?_encoding=UTF8&colid=JIN2B4LL9TRP&coliid=IJJJZRC4MINL2 Kate says: October 01, 2016 at 01:21 PM Oh, this "russety" weather... makes my world go around. :-) Sometimes you just need to take a break from life & knit. I'd be happy knitting for days... too bad the laundry needs to be washed. :-) Nicki says: October 02, 2016 at 12:15 AM It all looks so warm and cozy. I need to start knitting again. I got cross last year after I knit the same hat 3 times and managed to destroy it each time right at the very end. I wonder why apple picking is not such a big thing in the UK🤔 Denise says: October 02, 2016 at 06:30 AM Fall is just the best, isn't it? It's in the air here, too, though still a little bit warm but the humidity has finally receded. I've been eating lunch outside and reading Harry Potter every day during my lunch hour and it is my slice of heaven. Apple picking with littles is sooooo much fun, I really miss those days, but love reliving the memories here. Keep Fallin'😉 Beautiful post, thank you! P.S. I really must learn to knit, I know I'd love it! Missy says: October 02, 2016 at 08:26 AM Lovely photos. Fall is my favorite season and I miss it so much, living in Puerto Rico. I'm thrilled that I'm hopping on a plane with my kids to visit Grandma and Grandpa in NH this week! Leanne says: October 02, 2016 at 03:43 PM I have been away from my blog for many many months. So glad to keep up with you on instagram :) This will be my first fall/winter in my empty nest...I will be so glad to spend time going back and catching up on things here.

(Michael Reaves/Getty Images) Print Email Dan Duggan | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com By Dan Duggan | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on September 30, 2016 at 4:55 PM, updated September 30, 2016 at 5:22 PM comments EAST RUTHERFORD — Eli Apple and Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie haven't yet been ruled out for the Giants' game against the Vikings on Monday night. But Giants defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo sounds like he's not expecting to have two of his top cornerbacks for the game. "We'll miss them," Spagnuolo said. "We've got to get somebody else to step up and hopefully they can get healthy quick." Apple (hamstring) and Rodgers-Cromartie (groin) left last Sunday's loss to the Redskins with injuries. They have not participated in practice this week, working on the side with trainers during the brief portions of practice open to the media on Thursday and Friday. Ben McAdoo and Odell Beckham Jr. on emotions If Apple and Rodgers-Cromartie are out, Trevin Wade will likely take over as the starting cornerback opposite Janoris Jenkins and Leon Hall would be the primary slot corner. Running back Rashad Jennings was a limited participant in Friday's practice as he deals with a thumb injury that sidelined him in Week 3. McAdoo said Jennings is progressing, but a decision about the running back's status may not come until game day. Here is Friday's full injury report: GIANTS DID NOT PRACTICE •CB Eli Apple (hamstring): It appears that the Giants will exercise caution with Apple's hamstring injury. •S Nat Berhe (concussion): Berhe is in the concussion protocol after reporting a headache on Wednesday. •RT Marshall Newhouse (calf): Newhouse remains out with a calf injury he suffered in Week 2. Bobby Hart is in line to start again start at right tackle. •CB Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie (groin): It's too early to rule Rodgers-Cromartie out, but it doesn't look like he'll be ready for Monday. •DT Robert Thomas (illness): Thomas remains out with an undisclosed illness, but he has been working on the side with trainers during practice. McAdoo said he hopes Thomas will practice next week. •FS Darian Thompson (foot): Thompson's left foot is still in a walking boot. Thompson remains week-to-week. Adams ready for opportunity LIMITED PRACTICE PARTICIPANT •RB Rashad Jennings (thumb): McAdoo said Jennings is progressing, but there is no definitive word yet if the running back will play on Monday. FULL PRACTICE PARTICIPANT •DE Olivier Vernon (wrist): Vernon said his wrist injury is just a "little nick." He will likely to continue to play with his wrist heavily wrapped. VIKINGS DID NOT PRACTICE •TE David Morgan (knee): Morgan has not practiced this week after injuring his knee on Sunday. •DT Sharrif Floyd (knee): Floyd underwent knee surgery last week. LIMITED PRACTICE PARTICIPANT •WR Stefon Diggs (groin): Diggs was added to the injury report on Friday with a groin injury. •FB Zach Line (knee): Line returned to practice after missing Thursday's session with a knee injury. •G Alex Boone (hip): The team's starting left guard was limited on Friday after missing Thursday's practice with a hip injury. FULL PRACTICE PARTICIPANT •LB Anthony Barr (wrist): The starting strong side linebacker has 11 tackles this season. •RB Jerick McKinnon (toe): With Adrian Peterson out with a knee injury, McKinnon has taken over as the Vikings' lead back. He has 19 carries for 53 yards this season. •CB Xavier Rhodes (knee): Rhodes is the Vikings' top cornerback. •TE MyCole Pruitt (knee): Pruitt returned to practice this week after spraining his MCL in the preseason finale.

The Phoneys app makes it possible to place stickers that look like the received blue (iMessage) and green (SMS) speech bubbles within the Messages app. The idea is to make it look like friends have sent something they haven’t, which could be hilarious and in some circumstances be very, very damaging to enemies. Related: iOS 10 review The 99¢ pack even uses the San Francisco font to make the bubbles look more convincing. It seemed to strike a chord with iPhone-owning pranksters, topping the Top Grossing and Top Paid sections of the Messages App Store. Well, now Apple seems pretty peeved the stickers made it through the app review process and has contacted the developer to make changes or face deletion. Posting on Medium (via BGR), the developer, Adam Howell wrote: “Apple’s lawyers weren’t happy that Phoneys got through the review process. The stickers couldn’t be blue or green, they couldn’t use San Francisco as the typeface, and the app could no longer be marketed as a “prank” app, because Apple doesn’t approve prank apps (even though I myself had never used the word “prank” when marketing Phoneys, others did, and I certainly understood where he was coming from). They were not going to pull the app, Bill made sure to emphasize. They’d give me a week, until next Thursday, to fundamentally change it so that the bubbles looked nothing like iMessage bubbles, instead looking something closer to “comic book cartoon bubbles”. I said okay, thanks a lot Bill, and that was the end of the conversation.” Howell has the choice of making the changes and disappointing customers or not making the changes and seeing the app pulled… and disappointing customers. Right now he hasn’t decided which avenue to take, but his tale of woe is an example of what happens when you turn an app that was working perfectly well for many years into a gimmick, in order to try and compete with Snapchat.

It’s a hard question to answer, one reason Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has gained traction with voters by haranguing free-trade deals with China, Mexico and other nations. When a US factory closes and the jobs move overseas, it’s pretty clear that open borders are harming everybody who just got axed. Free trade is supposed to generate benefits that compensate for such harm, and leave Americans better off overall. But the upsides of trade tend to be intangible, incremental and difficult to pinpoint. Free trade has almost certainly brought enormous benefits to the US economy, however, including the creation of whole new industries that might not exist if the United States had the sort of closed economy Trump seems to prefer. “Manufacturing is not disappearing, but the kinds of things the United States makes are changing,” says trade economist Peter Schott of Yale University. “When a given product goes offshore, the dynamism of the economy lets the United States produce things it may not have otherwise produced.” Schott and other trade experts point to the iPhone as a groundbreaking product that might never have existed under a more closed economic system with the kinds of trade protections Trump favors. By the time Apple (AAPL) launched the iPhone in 2007, there were well-established supply chains in Asia, mostly in China, able to churn out high-quality electronics at a fraction of the cost of producing them in the United States or other developed countries. The key to the iPhone’s profitability Apple already assembled computers and its hit iPod music player in China, so it had detailed knowledge of supply chains there. China also was a member of the World Trade Organization by then, which meant Apple knew it could count on the economics of cheap Chinese production well into the future, instead of worrying that Congress might grow testy over some issue and pass legislation disrupting the trade relationship, which can’t happen under WTO rules. That kind of certainty let Apple CEO Steve Jobs know he could invest billions in the iPhone with minimal risk of disruptive supply shocks. The iPhone went on sale in 2007, priced at $499 for the cheapest model. That was steep for ordinary consumers, yet the iPhone went on to become the most profitable product in Apple’s history. It’s impossible to know if Apple would have made the iPhone if it had no choice but to manufacture it in the US, with American labor and American parts. Undoubtedly, however, that would have shifted the whole economic equation for Apple and made the iPhone less profitable or perhaps unprofitable. It would also have raised the price for consumers. There’s a wide range of estimates for how much it would have cost Apple to build the iPhone in America—from a relatively modest $65 in added cost per phone to a much larger tab that would have exceeded Apple’s annual profit at the time. Some Apple executives have said the company couldn’t have built the iPhone in the United States no matter what the cost, because regulations were too onerous, labor rules too restrictive and engineers too scarce. Chinese suppliers, by contrast, could muster all the workers necessary on short notice and meet a surge in demand with few hiccups. Apple likes to point out that its products are “designed in California,” a sort of reminder that Apple does employ about 75,000 people in the United States, which isn’t shabby. And it claims the “ecosystem” for its products has created an additional 1.4 million jobs. That number may or may not be accurate, but it is self-evident that a whole new industry of app developers, communication services and digital startups has benefited from the runaway success of the iPhone and other mobile devices. US innovation manufactured in China Free trade made that possible, but there’s an important catch: The people benefiting from open barriers aren’t the same people being hurt by them, and we have poor mechanisms at the moment for helping people hurt by free trade get a cut of the prosperity it creates elsewhere in the economy. In theory, workers are supposed to transfer from one industry to another as various types of work get shifted to lower-cost regions. In reality, there are many barriers that prevent that from happening: The employers of the future aren’t always located near the employers of the past, forcing people to move to remain employed. Some people can’t afford to move, because they’re upside down on a mortgage or living costs in a new locale are way too expensive. Even people who can move often lack the skills employers want today. It’s often hard even knowing what skills employers want, given how fast technology changes. Read More A reported 700,000 people work for Apple contractors such as Foxconn, assembling iPhones, iPads and other Apple products in China. That’s roughly 10 times Apple’s US payroll. Those are the kinds of jobs Trump wants to “bring back” to the United States. But as Steve Jobs told President Obama in 2011, “those jobs aren’t coming back.” His reasoning: American consumers won’t pay for the higher cost of US labor, and companies won’t invest in products if costs are too high and the economic viability of the product dubious. Many other innovations of the last 20 years fit the same profile as the iPhone: iRobot’s (IRBT) robotic vacuums, the Roku TV stick, the Amazon (AMZN) Echo “digital assistant,” fitness-tracking gizmos such as FitBit (FIT), GoPro (GPRO) action cameras and so on. All of those devices involve American engineering and business know-how, with the devices themselves manufactured in China or other low-cost places. Trade restrictions raising the cost of foreign imports or forcing the use of American workers could have quashed all of those innovations. As new industries develop, they initially benefit lucky elites who have the right skills and happen to be in the right place at the right time. That may be the phase we’re in right now. But the benefits of technology revolutions typically widen over time. “Students in school who might have been headed to another industry see what’s happening and become available for new things,” says Schott. “A worker who lost an apparel job in North Carolina probably won’t go work for Google. But her kid might.” What’s missing amid this turbulent transition from the industrial economy of the 20th century to the digital one of the 21st is a stronger safety net for lower-skilled workers who are inevitably displaced when companies have wide latitude to pursue efficiency. Bringing back unskilled assembly-line jobs that aren’t so great to start with, as Trump wants to do, isn’t the answer. But it might help to identify the victims of free trade faster, amp up aid programs, consider relocation assistance and enlist companies to do more to support communities where they operate. And encourage those kids to aspire to work at Google someday. Rick Newman’s latest book is Liberty for All: A Manifesto for Reclaiming Financial and Political Freedom.

I noticed this headline in the news this morning: Apple patent details visual-based AR navigation, confirms Flyby Media acquisition. The article tells us that augmented reality can be accomplished by using information from a phone such as image data from a camera, and sensor data from devices such as a gyroscope and an accelerometer, and that information can be augmented by marrying images of reality with computer generated imagery. I checked out the patent referred to in the article, and it had me wondering what role Flyby Media played in Google’s Project Tango, which we are told that they used in the Apple Insider article. The patent linked to in that news story is in Apple’s name, but the inventors are originally from Flyby Media. The patent is: Visual-based inertial navigation Inventors: Alex Flint, Oleg Naroditsky, Christopher P. Broaddus, Andriy Grygorenko, Stergios Roumeliotis, and Oriel Bergig Assigned to: Apple Inc. Regents of the University of Minnesota US Patent 9,424,647 Granted August 23, 2016 Filed: August 12, 2014 Abstract A method includes: receiving sensor measurements from a pre-processing module, in which the sensor measurements include image data and inertial data for a device; transferring, using a processor, information derived from the sensor measurements, from a first set of variables associated with a first window of time to a second set of variables associated with a second window of time, in which the first and second windows consecutively overlap in time; and outputting, to a post-processing module, a state of the device based on the transferred information. An image from the patent shows how indoor mapping might be improved by the collection of information using imagery from Flyby Media: Improved Indoor Mapping The Apple Insider article points to this earlier article from them that describes other acquisitions of companies working in Augmented Reality: Rumor: Apple has ‘hundreds of staff’ working on virtual & augmented reality projects Two of the inventors listed on this patent supposedly now work at Apple, Naroditsky and Grygorenko,and one, Roumeliotis, is a professor at the University of Minnesota. I was curious as to what other patents Flyby Media might have, and the last sentence in the abstract from the first one, about augmented reality games was interesting. Systems and methods for efficient 3D tracking of weakly textured planar surfaces for augmented reality applications Inventors: Christopher Broaddus, Andriy Grygorenko, Netanel Hagbi, and Oriel Y. Bergig; Assignee: Flyby Media, Inc. US Patent 9,147,251 Granted: September 29, 2015 Filed: August 3, 2012 Abstract The present system provides an on the fly simple to complex 6DOF registration approach using the direct method. On the fly means it does not require training time, a user points a phone/camera to a planar surface and can start tracking it instantly. Simple to complex means the system performs registration in multiple levels of complexity from 2DOF to 6DOF. By increasing the complexity model the system enables more surfaces to be tracked and for surfaces that are tracked the system can avoid local minima solution providing a more robust and accurate 6DOF tracking. Even surfaces that are very weak in features can be tracked in 6DOF and virtual content can be registered to them. The system enables playing Augmented Reality games on low-end devices such as mobile phones on almost any surface in the real world. Systems and methods for tracking natural planar shapes for augmented reality applications Inventors: Netanel Hagbi, Oriel Y. Bergig, and Jihad A. Elsana Assigned to: Flyby Media, Inc. US Patent 8,644,551 Granted: February 4, 2014 Filed: October 15, 2010 Abstract The present disclosure relates to systems and methods for tracking planar shapes for augmented-reality (AR) applications. Systems for real-time recognition and camera six degrees of freedom pose-estimation from planar shapes are disclosed. Recognizable shapes can be augmented with 3D content. Recognizable shapes can be in form of a predefined library being updated online using a network. Shapes can be added to the library when the user points to a shape and asks the system to start recognizing it. The systems perform shape recognition by analyzing contour structures and generating projective invariant signatures. Image features are further extracted for pose estimation and tracking. Sample points are matched by evolving an active contour in real time. It’s interesting seeing how Apple is advancing in Augmented Reality Technology by acquisitions of technology and hiring employees from companies such as Flyby Media. Will Apple be focusing upon games such as Pokemon Go, or do they have other ideas in mind, like I alluded to in this post on a new Apple patent on Augmented Reality Displays from them: Might We Soon See Apple Augmented Reality?. We see Apple is working upon building devices that can display augmented reality, and they are acquiring expertise and technology that assists in using augmented reality in applications such as indoor mapping.

Such as: “This picture would look great in your single men’s suit Michael” or “This exercise bike would perfectly fit out in the empty corner of your room”.

The ILDOCK offers a Lightning charging port and analog headphone jack for your iPhone 7 or any Apple device with a Lightning port. Credit: ildockgear More like this Why Apple dropped the headphone jack in the iPhone 7 Deep-dive review: The iPhone 7 Plus is the best iPhone yet What happens when Apple removes headphone jacks and USB ports from our devices Video Mingis on Tech: The iPhone 7, Apple Watch 2 -- and the gadget guy! There were plenty of complaints in the mainstream media and the blogosphere when Apple announced its iPhone 7 ships without an analog headphone jack. The idea of forcing users to toss their older headphones to use Apple's new Lightning port-enabled ear buds or buy its soon-to-be-released $159 wireless AirPods created a visceral reaction in consumer circles. Industry pundits also speculated that third-party adapters allowing analog headphones to connect to the iPhone would soon follow... and so they have. Los Angeles start-up ildockgear has created a Lightning adapter that allows iPhone 7 users to charge their device and listen to music over analog headphones at the same time. The device is about the size of a U.S. quarter. ildockgear The ILDOCK with its headphone jack and Lightning charging port. The company began a crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter three days ago for its ILDOCK, and it has already garnered more than $20,000, four times its original goal. In addition to the basic ILDOCK adapter, which contains a 3.5mm headphone jack and a Lightning charging port, the company has also produced an ILDOCK Plus, which adds an SD card slot, a microSD slot and USB ports. Users can connect up to a 128GB flash card with ILDOCK Plus or connect to any size USB drives, the company states in its marketing material. ildockgear The ILDOCK Plus's ports include an SD slot, a microSD slot and a USB port, along with the Lightning and analog headphone jack ports. Early-bird backers can reserve an ILDOCK for a pledge of $5 and currently can get two ILDOCK Plus adapters for $18. (A $15 single ILDOCK Plus offer has already sold out.) The ILDOCK and ILDOCK plus come in four iPhone 7-mimicking colors: Silver, gold, rose gold and "space" gray. ildockgear The ILDOCK's various colors. In addition to compatibility with the headphone jackless iPhone 7, the ILDOCK also works with any iPhone or iPad with a Lightning port. The ILDOCKs are expected to begin shipping in November.

This is going to be BIG... Blog Weekly Newsletter Dinners Meet or Pitch This is going to be BIG... Blog/ Weekly Newsletter/ Dinners/ Meet or Pitch/ This is going to be BIG... Venture Capital, Seed and Pre-Seed Investments, New York, Brooklyn, Cycling, Street Hockey and Softball Blog This is going to be BIG... Blog/ Weekly Newsletter/ Dinners/ Meet or Pitch/ I invest in tech-related seed and pre-seed NYC startups at Brooklyn Bridge Ventures.  Native Brooklynite, 7x triathlete, 4x marathoner, softball player, street hockey goalie.  Check out my This Week in Startups interview or check out my bio here. September 28, 2016 In Hardware, You're Only as Good as Your Next Product: See goTenna September 28, 2016/ Charlie O'Donnell When hardware maker Quirky went out of business, Ben Einstein at Bolt had this to say: "A good company builds one product, learns from its customers, and iterates to make that product exceptional. Each step in the process is designed to refine a product and find the often elusive “product/market fit” that is the basis for all successful startups. Imagine if Apple built the first app-free iPhone and then moved on to the Apple Watch, or GoPro only sold one version of its camera and then decided to launch something totally different." Iterating as a hardware company, of course, isn't the easiest thing in the world.  Design and production cycles are long, and you can't upgrade the physical parts on the fly.  That's why so many companies never make it to a second product.  Take Nest, for example, that wowed the world with its thermostat, but never followed up with anything consumers really felt the same way about.   Often times, the challenge is coming up with a first product that people like that you can deliver in a reasonable amount of time, knowing it won't have everything you could ever hope to build.  The tricky part is doing that while not distracting yourself and diverting too many resources away from a product that more closely reflects your long term, ultimate goal. That's why I'm so excited to see a Brooklyn Bridge Ventures portfolio company, goTenna, launch its new product, goTenna Mesh. goTenna Mesh is the first 100% off-grid, mobile, long-range consumer-ready mesh network device, which will be available internationally. The announcement comes along with the launch of goTenna’s premium service, goTenna Plus, and the release of the goTenna open Software Development Kit (SDK).  goTenna Mesh pairs with any iOS or Android device to allow users to text and share GPS locations, up to several miles away depending on terrain and elevation. This is the first goTenna product that will be available outside the United States and it will be sold in pairs for $179 but is available in limited quantities at promotional pricing (starting at $129) today on a preorder basis before shipment begins later this year.  Check out their video for more info. Unlike traditional networks, a mesh network gets stronger as more people use it.  goTenna Mesh is smaller, sleeker than goTenna’s flagship product, and provides even greater utility thanks to the introduction of mesh networking. By automatically and privately relaying your message through other users if your recipient(s) are not within point-to-point range or are otherwise obstructed, you can effectively double or triple your range and be likelier to get a message through in difficult situations.  goTenna Mesh is anchored by intelligent mesh protocols (named “Aspen Grove”) that deliver a 100% off-grid, entirely mobile, long-range mesh network. Such a technology has never been achieved outside hulking military tactical systems that cost tens of thousands of dollars per unit.  Congrats to the goTenna team on a huge accomplishment for their customers.  This is the product that Daniela and Jorge had in mind when they first started the company--when goTenna was just a box full of wires that sent a text across a table to another box full of wires.  I'm excited to have been their first VC backer. I can't wait to see what's next! ;) September 28, 2016/ Charlie O'Donnell/ Charlie O'Donnell How come VCs are... jerks? This is Not the Trump You are ...

This is likely a custom ARM chip from Apple as the A7 was dubbed Cyclone, the A8 was Typhoon, and the A9 was Twister. It may even be the A10 Fusion processor found in the iPhone 7. The site notes that Apple may have already been taking steps to prepare for a laptop with an ARM processor. It is striking that developers no longer send the final binaries when submitting an app, but a bit code. This bit code is then used by Apple to convert the application to the specific platform. Which means that Apple can easily make the transition to a different instruction set, for example, switching from x86 to ARM without all apps need to be resubmitted. It is probably also one of the reasons why legacy applications have recently been removed from the App Store. An ARM MacBook has been rumored for quite some time. It's believed that A-series chips would be limited to lower-end devices initially, perhaps a future version of the rumored 12-inch MacBook Air would be a possible candidate. Apple is set to unveil a slew of updates to its Mac lineup next month. Please follow iClarified on Twitter, Facebook, Google+, or RSS for updates.

Apple is about to ban everyone’s favorite iOS 10 stickers app Yoni Heisler BGR NewsSeptember 30, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share Apple, as opposed to Google, just doesn’t know how to kick back and relax sometimes. After a prank app called Phoneys skyrocketed to the top of the iMessage App Store charts, Apple informed the developer of the app, Adam Howell, that the app will be removed  in a week if he doesn’t implement some design tweaks that would fundamentally alter the appeal and overall utility of the app. For those unfamiliar, Phoneys is a fun iMessage app that let users send stickers designed to look exactly like the blue iMessage bubbles iOS users are accustomed to. The end result is that users can send their friends messages and make it seem as if they were the ones who sent it. DON'T MISS: Yup, now the iPhone 7 is exploding As Sara Perez noted, “And thanks to the new layering feature in the updated version of iMessage, you can place these stickers — which say things like “My political views are totally wrong” or “I have terrible taste in music” — overtop your friend’s message to make it look like they texted these self-deprecating statements to you.” Intrigued, I actually paid for the app earlier this week and, suffice it to say, it’s a whole lot of fun. Now the app doesn’t work exactly as advertised because the font within the iMessage bubble is bigger than it should be. What’s more, the placement of the sticker itself isn’t always aligned correctly. Nonetheless, it still makes for a fun, if not confusing prank to pull on friends. Alas, it turns out that Apple wasn’t on-board with the shenanigans. Detailing Apple’s reaction, Howell recounts (via Medium) a phone conversation he had with Apple. Bill was nice, but to the point. Apple’s lawyers weren’t happy that Phoneys got through the review process. The stickers couldn’t be blue or green, they couldn’t use San Francisco as the typeface, and the app could no longer be marketed as a “prank” app, because Apple doesn’t approve prank apps (even though I myself had never used the word “prank” when marketing Phoneys, others did, and I certainly understood where he was coming from). They were not going to pull the app, Bill made sure to emphasize. They’d give me a week, until next Thursday, to fundamentally change it so that the bubbles looked nothing like iMessage bubbles, instead looking something closer to “comic book cartoon bubbles”. I said okay, thanks a lot Bill, and that was the end of the conversation.  All that said, you might want to grab the app here while it’s hot... and still available.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Apple’s relied on Intel chips to power its Mac computers since 2005, but that partnership could be coming to an end. A bit of code in macOS Sierra suggests the Cupertino company is gearing up to use its ARM-based processors instead. The macOS kernel, which Dutch site TechTastic took some time to dig through, adds support for a new CPU family called “ARM Hurricane.” Apple’s given its recent ARM-based Ax chips similar codenames (A7 was Cyclone, A8 was Typhoon and A9 was Twister).  Hurricane might be an unannounced sequel, or it might even be the A10 Fusion processor introduced with the iPhone 7. The A10 Fusion chip is Apple’s first model with a quad-core design, packing two cores for high-performance tasks and two energy efficient cores for regular activities. Based on recent benchmarks, the A10 Fusion even rivals the Intel Core M chip used to power the 12-inch MacBook. That means it’s not out of the question that new MacBooks could rely on an A-series chip. There’s one more bit of evidence. TechTastic notes that macOS Sierra also changes the way developers submit third-party Mac apps. Basically, it allows Apple to automatically convert those apps between platforms. That could make it possible to easily switch all apps to work with an ARM-based chip without requiring each developer to resubmit their software. Apple is expected to unveil new MacBooks next month, which could provide the company with a perfect opportunity to announce the big switch. Cupertino hasn’t confirmed plans for another event yet, but we’ll let you know as soon as the invitations go out.

Evan Niu (TMFNewCow) Sep 30, 2016 at 1:49PM iPhone 7. Image source: Apple. Geographically speaking, investors are well aware of where Apple, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) priorities lie. Greater China is one of the company's main growth engines at this point, and continues to march toward a day when it overtakes the U.S. business. CEO Tim Cook has predicted this will occur within the next few years, but right now the U.S. is still about $25 billion larger on a trailing-12-month basis. India is the next big country to tackle, while Apple slowly continues to build out its operations in Russia. That covers three of the BRIC countries. But what about the "B"? Brazil is just part of the picture It wasn't until early 2014 that Apple opened its first retail store in Brazil, and there are currently only two stores within the country. Beyond just Brazil, it may surprise you to learn that Apple's business in Canada and South America combined is actually extremely small. Apple reports Americas as a geographical operating segment, while separately disclosing the international mix of sales in its earnings releases. We can use the inverse of this figure to calculate Apple's domestic U.S. revenue, and then compare that to the broader Americas segment. Here's what we get if we back out U.S. revenue from Americas revenue. Data source: SEC filings, author's calculations. Graph by author. Americas ex-U.S. revenue, which would include all of Canada and all of South America, is typically only in the ballpark of $3 billion per quarter, plus or minus a billion or so. (The average since 2014 is $2.8 billion per quarter.) Apple has been doing quite well in emerging markets recently with various initiatives intended to make iPhones more affordable. To be clear, Apple has long faced headwinds in Brazil, mostly in the form of massive import tariffs that make it the most expensive country in the world to buy an iPhone. The whole only-two-stores-in-the-country thing doesn't help, either (even though Apple sells through third-party distributors). The Brazilian real has also been fairly volatile in recent years, making it tricky for Apple to properly price its products as it must navigate currency translation effects (net of hedging). Put another way, Canada and South America represent about 5% of overall revenue. It's true that the BRIC countries have experienced slowing growth and other macroeconomic headwinds recently, but it still feels like Apple could be doing more to expand its business in Canada and South America.

After publishing our second article about the phenomenon, which is being called “touch disease,” my inbox flooded with stories from people who—many out of blind brand loyalty to Apple—have continued replacing their iPhone 6 Pluses with refurbished units that are just as likely to break as their old ones. As we’ve detailed in those stories, “touch disease” is an iPhone 6 Plus flaw related to “bendgate” in which the two tiny “Touch IC” connectors, which translate touchscreen presses into a machine input, become unseated from the phone’s logic board. It can be recognized by flickering gray bars along the top of the phone, and is associated with intermittent or total touchscreen failure. "Apple called me, but when they called my screen was frozen and I could not answer the phone." Replacing the phone’s screen will not fix the problem—the only way to fix it is to have a micro soldering expert replace and resolder the Touch IC chips. Apple does not perform this repair, and does not tell its customers that there are some independent repair professionals who can perform this repair and can prevent it from recurring by installing an extra metal shield that stiffens the logic board. Instead, the company has told its Geniuses that iPhone 6 Plus touchscreen problems are a known issue, but has not publicly acknowledged the issue. A class action lawsuit has been filed in an attempt to force Apple to deal with the problem, or at least admit that the issue exists. Thousands of iPhone 6 Plus owners have joined the suit. Apple PR has ignored four separate requests for comment from Motherboard as well as requests for comment from every other news outlet that has asked about this issue. Several independent iPhone repair companies will fix touch disease for far cheaper than the $329 Apple charges to replace touch disease-afflicted phones with refurbished ones. I cannot vouch for the skills or success rate of any given repair professional, but here is a short list I’ve compiled of companies that do mail-in touch disease repairs: Apple Pie Repair Stop N Fix iPhone Repair iPad Rehab Wires Computing In the last 24 hours, I’ve gotten emails from 27 separate iPhone 6 Plus owners who have encountered this problem and were unaware that Apple internally considers it a known issue. Many of them have been put through lengthy tech support protocols on obviously broken phones only to be told that they would have to pay $329 for a refurbished phone that is still fundamentally flawed. Others have had to put up with months of forcefully bending or twisting the phone in order to get its Touch IC connectors to intermittently work for a few minutes, hours, or days before the problem inevitably resurfaces. In some cases, Apple will replace the phone for free, even out-of-warranty. But Apple store geniuses we spoke to said that such a replacement is up to the whims of the manager on duty at any given time. Here are some customer experiences from the emails I’ve received—in some cases, I asked for additional information about what they had been through. They’ve been lightly edited for length and grammar, and are published in an attempt to show that Apple turning a blind eye to touch disease continues to hurt some of the company’s most loyal customers. Cherish: “I originally purchased the phone new, around April 2015 (via Sprint). I did not pay for extended Apple Care. The problems started on August 16, before I updated to iOS 9.3.4. I assumed that it happened because I hadn't downloaded the update, so I did that. It took a long time because I couldn't hit ‘OK’ or "’Agree’ when the screen was frozen and I'd have to wait for the screen to become responsive so I could advance it or put in my passcode. That update didn't help, so I started deleting apps. I thought maybe the Facebook app was using too much memory. (I have a 128 GB and only use about 40 GB, so even that seemed strange). No luck, so I went to the Apple store. It was about 8:30 PM when I arrived and they were busy. When I told them the problem they assured me it was most likely a software glitch and I could handle it over the phone with a specialist. So they had me fill out the form on one of the Macs and I set up a time for the next day. "Missed a lot of great photos during a friend's wedding weekend because I unfortunately relied on my iPhone to be my camera" Apple called me on August 17, but when they called my screen was frozen and I could not answer the phone. They left a message saying they would call back. I went to my rental car, connected the Bluetooth and used that to answer. I gave them my alternate cell number so that solved the calling issue. I was on the phone with them for an hour after that and they insisted for most of the call that this is a normal occurrence and is often resolved by restoring the OS. Restart. Forced restart. Software update. Backup to computer. Full wipe and restore backup. Everything took longer because I could only advance the screen when it was responsive (getting through the ‘Hello’ and setup easily took 10 minutes each time). At the end of it all, there was no resolution. They told me I would need to take it to the Apple store and probably have the screen replaced for a crazy amount, and even then they weren't sure if that would resolve the issue since the source couldn't be pinpointed. By that Saturday, a few days later, the phone was better. Not 100 percent normal, but not freezing nearly as much and I'd even had a day with no problems. I canceled the appointment thinking all was good. The following week I was traveling again and the problems started the day before I left. With no time to reschedule an appointment I left town and dealt with days of screen freezing and stalling. Missed a lot of great photos during a friend's wedding weekend because I unfortunately relied on my iPhone to be my camera. The past month since then has been almost like a pattern. Three or so days of screen freezing all day long, which usually lasts 5-10 minutes, then the screen works for 1-3 minutes, then it stalls again. Sometimes it delays the touch actions, so when it starts working again all kinds of apps open and things are typed. Sometimes it freezes midway thru typing the password. It can take 3 minutes just to write a one line text. I always hated using Siri but I found that's the only way to send a text when the screen freezes. I have searched online week after week for a solution and the Apple site gives the same ‘restart’ and ‘restore’ suggestions. Your article was the first thing I've noticed that actually made sense in terms of what I was experiencing. I have tried to slightly bend it (*gasp*) a few times and magically that has kicked it back in gear (usually after 4-5 twists and bends), often working for a couple of days before going back into crazy, freeze mode. I try not to do that because it worries me, but it seemed to be the only thing that even sorta worked sometimes. It was disappointing that Apple hasn't done more about this known issue. I got a lot of teasing from my Android friends as they watched me frantically swipe across my screen with no success.” Paul: “I’ve lived with this problem on and off for almost two years now. It started happening almost as soon as I got it. I got a screen change under warranty, and had to get a refurbished phone the day after because the screen change did nothing. A few months later it started showing the signs again, and now I can't use it. As a kicker just a couple weeks ago, the phone stopped connecting to my cellular network and AT&T said it was a phone problem, not carrier. I had to order an iPhone 7 Plus but I feel cheated out of my money as I paid full price for my 6 Plus and could've used it at least another year or even two, if it worked properly.” Katasha: “The top grey bar would almost flicker all the time, and that's when I knew my phone wouldn't respond to my touch. So, after dealing with this for a couple weeks, I ended up at the Apple Store, where I was told yes, it was a problem, but not something that could be fixed, nor was it covered, and I exchanged my phone for $329, to get a new one, because what else was I to do?” One reader, Tracy, sent me a lengthy exchange she had with Apple Support on Twitter after she had already taken the phone to an Apple Store. They made her go through hours of diagnostics before ultimately deciding that yes, her phone had the exact same problem thousands of other phones have had. Andrea: “This exact thing happened to my phone over the summer and I went through over three months of hassle trying to resolve the issue. Never was resolved in a fair way for me. I paid to replace the phone. Apple diagnosed it as a ‘jailbreak’ done by me. I wasn't even familiar with that term let alone know how to ‘do’ it.” Dan: “My phone began to malfunction a little over a year after getting the phone. I've been putting up with the problem for about a year now. When it gets hot, like every time I go outside to my car, the screen freezes and I get ghost touches (it's like someone is opening apps and doing things on my phone), and there's a gray flicker at the top of my screen. To fix the problem, I grab the top and bottom of my phone and give it a little twist one way or the other, and the phone starts functioning normally again. "Next you torque...yes that's right twist your iPhone and it'll work" A month ago I went to an Apple Store. I told the genius that I have this problem with the phone, and he was aware of this problem. He said that they could fix the problem for $350(?) or something like that, but he said that I could just wait to get a new phone because they are coming out soon. I told him that I'm not going to pay that to get the phone fixed. I said that I'm not very happy with Apple and the fact that they have this unbelievable manufacturing problem in their flagship phone. He said that he was disappointed with Apple too about the problem.” Alexander: “I have been experiencing this problem almost one year after the purchase of the iPhone 6 Plus...just long enough after to not be under warranty. How I dealt with the problem is actually quite simple. You place your right thumb at the bottom right corner of the phone with fingers stretched across the back and you place your left thumb at the upper left corner of the phone with the fingers stretched behind. Next you torque...yes that's right twist your iPhone and it'll work. Clearly a flexgate/engineer flaw/defect that Apple should have dealt with.” James: “I just read your article, I have an iPhone 6+ that had that same issue. I took it to ATT and they tried to tell me it got wet but they couldn't see any indication that the water identifiers were tripped. After fighting with them for 45 minutes and showing them my phone is in an otter box they finally warrantied my phone with a refurbished iPhone 6 Plus, even though the one that had an issue was brand new. Now my replacement phone is doing the same thing. After this I will never buy another Apple product, their customer service is very poor. They sell phones at the phone carrier’s office but then you have to take it to Apple for everything else after 30 days. Their wait times are stupid, I had to wait three hours one day at a store just to be told there is nothing they can do without spending $400.” "Thinking of the time that I have spent in the Apple Store, I can't imagine the amount of time I have wasted there" Cameron: “I dealt with this issue a couple of months ago with an iPhone 6 Plus that was six months old. I had taken meticulous care of the phone because I had multiple issues with a previous 6 Plus phone that Apple ultimately replaced. When this issue occurred the phone was out of warranty and Apple gave me the run around about my options. Your article describes most of my experience with Apple. After multiple calls to their support line and trips to the Apple Store, my phone was replaced without having to pay the $329 fee. They informed me that they had made an exception for me and not to expect it in the future. The experience was extremely disappointing.” Christopher: “I bought the 6 Plus with the 128 GB when it first came out. At first it worked great, then the camera had issues. They replaced the phone and I was back a month later. They repaired that phone for the same camera issue and it still continued. Well now I am on my 4th, yes 4th phone, that they replaced, and countless repairs. I agree that the iPhone 6 Plus has some major engineering issues that they won't fix. "I have had five of these phones, three of which had the touch screen issue" The last issue was with the logic board. I had that phone only two weeks before it started that problem. I recently went in because it became so bad I couldn't even make an emergency phone call if I had to. They looked at it and told me it was an issue with the logic board and instantly brought out a new iPhone. I have been so pissed off with this phone and them just repairing it or replacing it with another phone that has issues. I do believe this will be the last Apple product that I will buy. I find it unacceptable that this is the fourth phone with countless repairs. Thinking of the time that I have spent in the Apple Store, because it's a minimum of an hour, I can't imagine the amount of time I have wasted there.” Jen: “This client was two hours late to our meeting because he was stuck at an Apple store because his phone had lines and couldn't be used. They told him it was a disease the screen had and he had to purchase another phone. He purchased the iPhone 7.” Ray: “I have had five of these phones, three of which had the touch screen issue, (one got stolen). I'm currently on my fifth and waiting to upgrade to something that isn't an Apple product, this is over a two year period by the way. I paid for one of these phones out of pocket which was awful, 324 dollars later and I had a phone that shit the bed in three months. This was my most extreme case obviously. The rest of the phones take about six or seven months to break, and every single Apple employee knows about it. They all say it's common with these phones and I always try and ask for a different model. I even asked for an iPhone 5 because I didn't want to deal with this anymore and they wouldn't budge. Five iPhone 6 Pluses later and I've had it with Apple.” Kristin: “My phone has had problems from the start and I really haven't had it that long. The screen just never really worked right, but just last weekend, I couldn't answer an incoming call, I wiped the screen with my shirt sleeve and then restarted it and it seemed ok. I thought about taking it in for repair but realized I couldn't reproduce it in the store since it only happens sporadically. Thank you for your article. It reassured me that I'm not going crazy!” Topics: apple, iphones, iphone 6 plus, Touch Disease, repair, Right to Repair, machines, short circuit Contact the author by email or Twitter.

The #1 Top Paid item in the Messages App Store, Phoneys employs a simple trick to make the illusion work: it provides stickers that look exactly like the blue iMessage bubbles. Phoneys developer Adam Howell says Apple told him it would be pulling the app next Thursday unless it’s fundamentally changed so that the stickers looked nothing like iMessage bubbles. Apple objected that Phoneys uses its trademarked San Francisco typeface and iMessage bubble design without permission. Howell, who works full-time as a remote employee for San Francisco-based Lithium, explains in a blog post on Medium: Apple’s lawyers weren’t happy that Phoneys got through the review process. The stickers couldn’t be blue or green, they couldn’t use San Francisco as the typeface, and the app could no longer be marketed as a “prank” app, because Apple doesn’t approve prank apps (even though I myself had never used the word “prank” when marketing Phoneys, others did, and I certainly understood where he [Apple employee] was coming from). Apple gave him until next Thursday to fundamentally change the app so that the bubbles looked something closer to “comic book cartoon bubbles”. As mentioned, the hilarious app includes dozens of stickers resembling iMessage bubbles, each with a different message written on it. As you know, stickers in iOS 10 Messages can be stamped on top of chat bubbles. Therefore, placing one of the Phoneys stickers over your friend’s message bubble makes it look as if they texted you self-deprecating statements like “I have terrible taste in music”, “You make this parenting thing look easy”, “My political views are totally wrong”, “The sports team I pull for sucks” and so forth. The idea for the app was born out of an experiment, Howell told TechCrunch: I noticed how you could completely cover up texts with stickers. I started joking with a friend that I could maybe make him say anything I wanted. So I made a couple quick stickers locally on my iPhone to test it out, and sure enough it worked. After tweeting out the idea, he received lots of positive feedback and decided to turn the project into a reality in the form of a downloadable sticker pack for iOS 10 Messages. Encouraged by the app’s success and the fact that Apple approved it without objection, he even contemplated releasing another set of prank stickers and creating a brand new dedicated app that would let people write their own “phoney” texts. The 99-cent sticker pack is currently live in the App Store, so download it now if you like before Howell changes it substantially, which would defeat the very purpose of the app, or Apple removes it a week from today.

A kind of warning should have been included in the app description… but not gonna sue the guy 😉 PhoneTechJay You’re right. I mean they should make it known that if you have a different font size it wont look uniform, and the same goes for the other person, if they have a different font size they should know right away.

Tech reviews and broad tech industry media coverage are often about the cutting edge of technology, and as a result can be very critical of anything seen as less than stellar. But the reality is that many ordinary people regularly use technology that could be much more accurately described as “good enough” rather than bleeding-edge. The vast majority of us aren’t using the latest and greatest technology, not least because that often costs more than we’re willing (or able) to spend, and yet we do just fine. This creates an odd disconnect between how real people use technology and how the experts talk about that same technology. EarPods and defaults Every iPhone ever shipped has come with a pair of Apple-provided earbuds in the box, just as iPods did before them. These earbuds have never been at the forefront of headphone technology — they’re small, relatively cheap to manufacture and make no claim to be anything more than they are. But Apple nevertheless made them part of its early ad campaigns for the iPod, and they became a fashion statement of sorts. In a recent survey conducted by Tech.pinions editor Ben Bajarin, more than half of those surveyed said they used the headphones that came in the box. For many people, the basic option is just fine, and they’ll never look beyond it. The fact is, defaults are powerful. Many people use those defaults, especially when they’re good enough. That’s not to say there aren’t better options out there for audiophiles, or those who want noise-canceling or over-ear options, but it is to say that, for many people, the basic option is just fine, and they’ll never look beyond it. This is obviously important in the context of the removal of the 3.5mm headphone jack on the new iPhone 7. Apple is banking on the fact the majority of people who buy one of these new phones will use the new Lightning-based EarPods, just as they have always used their 3.5mm predecessors. Those who don’t will use the free adapter with their existing headphones, or start or continue using wireless options. Deciding where good enough is enough It’s notable, however, that Apple chose not to ship Bluetooth earbuds in the box, even though its vision for the future is a wireless one. Why is this? I think there are two reasons. First, as a practical financial matter, “good enough” in a Bluetooth headset costs significantly more than in wired earbuds, and Apple didn’t want to either raise the price or lower the margins on new iPhones to accommodate that increased cost. But I think the other reason is that there is a dividing line between products that can afford to be simply good enough and those that can’t. Apple wants to evangelize wireless technology, and you don’t sell a vision based on “good enough” products. You make the very best to sell the story and then, over time, you supply options which are good enough to meet needs further down market. When the perception of a product affects the perception of your brand, you can’t just do “good enough” (unless that’s the brand identity you’re going for, as with Amazon’s Basics line of electronics). Hence, Apple’s very different focus with its AirPods, which are on par with Apple’s hero products in terms of the positioning, marketing and, yes, pricing. This marks a departure for the Apple brand in the headphone space, although, of course, the acquisition of Beats brought higher-end headphones into the company under a separate brand. That, in turn, signifies something about the broader significance Apple expects the AirPods to take on over time, something others have written about here and elsewhere, and which I’ll likely tackle separately soon. The challenge of premium One of the biggest challenges for consumer electronics brands is targeting the premium segment while also serving lower segments of the market. One of Apple’s strengths is it has never really strayed from its premium positioning, even as it has brought several of its major product lines down in price over time. Conversely, other smartphone vendors looking to target the high end have also served the mid-market, and have struggled to associate their brands with premium positioning. This becomes particularly challenging when the same brands put out “good enough” and premium products in the same product category, like smartphones. Part of Apple’s genius has been carefully separating the categories where it provides premium products from those where it participates at a good-enough level, and not allowing the two to mix or converge. The fact that Motorola and Samsung produce both high-end flagships and very cheap low-end smartphones doesn’t help their attempts to compete with Apple for the premium customer, and Motorola has arguably largely abandoned the very high end in the last year or two. In the car market, this problem is solved with sub-brands (think Lexus versus Toyota, or Cadillac versus Chevy), but we haven’t yet seen that approach play out in the consumer technology market in the same way. Disruption theory and jobs to be done Clayton Christensen’s Disruption Theory comes into play here, too — when companies insist on providing only a premium version of certain products, they risk low-end disruption from competitors catering to the needs of those who feel over-served by the current options. However, despite repeated predictions that the premium smartphone market would eventually be disrupted in this way, it hasn’t happened. Yes, low-end Android smartphones have become increasingly capable and cheap, but that’s disrupted almost entirely other Android smartphone vendors rather than Apple. Products that have strong personal associations — smartphones, cars, clothing and other luxury goods — are stubbornly resistant to low-end disruption. I believe there’s something about products that have strong personal associations — such as smartphones, cars, clothing and other luxury goods — which make them stubbornly resistant to low-end disruption. Our use of these products says something about us, and using cheaper imitators may not convey the message we want. The job to be done of smartphones and other similar products, then, goes beyond their obvious functions, and is another reason why “good enough” isn’t good enough for at least some buyers who can afford to be more discriminating. This continues to be one of many fascinating aspects of the smartphone market that separate it from the rest of the consumer electronics industry and continue to make it such an interesting one to follow.

In consumer technology, the two easiest paths to success are to be either first or best. Take smartwatches, for example: Pebble broke Kickstarter records because it was the first capable wearable in the category. Apple's wearable arrived late, but it's universally considered to be the most powerful smartwatch on the market. Now the Apple Watch has an overwhelming market share, while Pebble does its best to hang on to its early adopters.  The very same thing is happening with virtual reality headsets.  Oculus vs. HTC The Oculus Rift, another Kickstarter darling, is practically a household name, thanks in no small part to Facebook's acquisition of Oculus and the device's long development time. The Rift was the first VR headset to prove that it could be taken seriously, but it's not the best. That title belongs to the HTC Vive.  HTC Vive HTC HTC's Vive virtual reality headset is fast becoming the go-to hardware of choice for anyone who wants to go beyond Google Cardboard and experience the full potential of VR. The differences between the Rift and Vive are bigger than you'd guess by looking at them side-by-side. Display resolution, which is always the first thing users latch on to as a point of comparison, is an identical 1080 x 1200 per eye, with a 90Hz refresh rate.  Where the Vive separates itself is with its room-scale tracking and motion controllers. With the Rift, looking around, standing, and leaning a bit is the extent to which you can feel immersed in the virtual world. It's impressive, but only until you experience the Vive's room-scale VR tracking, which allows you to walk around the virtual world with your own feet. Combined with the Vive's motion controllers, the system is capable of tracking intricate movements, letting you crouch behind cover in a war game, or walk 360-degrees around a virtual sculpture as you chip away bits of digital rock.  Oculus Rift w/ Touch Controllers Oculus Oculus is planning to add room-scale VR support to the Rift by the end of the year, which will require additional movement sensors along with Oculus Touch motion controllers. No firm price or release date for these add-ons has been revealed, but it will likely close the gap between the Rift's $600 cost and the $800 HTC Vive, which already comes with the sensors and controllers needed for the full-room experience.  Oculus' woes Aside from coming up short in capability, Oculus has another problem, and it's one of timing. Developers have been working on Rift VR titles for years, and the more-capable HTC Vive debuted at a time when those developers were just reaching the limits of what the Rift was capable of in terms of tracking and "presence," as they so often like to call it. Many made the switch to the Vive and haven't looked back. In a VRDC poll released last month, more developers said they were working on Vive titles than for any other device.  Earlier this year, in an obvious attempt at holding on to the third-party developers who had been producing Rift experiences for months, Oculus began enforcing its headset-exclusive DRM policy that blocked Rift-enabled games from being played on the HTC Vive. It was a move born out of the simple fact that the Vive could do what the Rift does, and then some.  Developers, eager to make as much money and reach as many customers as possible, were outraged, and for good reason. Many felt that they were being punished for the limitations of the Rift, over which they had no control. The situation became so dire that Oculus grew tired of attempting to block Vive users and disabled the DRM restriction entirely.  SUPERHYPERCUBE will not be supporting Oculus. https://t.co/sqtAzZ8hJZ— Polytron (@Polytron) September 23, 2016 The Oculus Touch accessories should, the company hopes, bring the Rift and Vive back into parity. Unfortunately for Oculus, it may no longer be a matter of hardware capability but of brand loyalty. On top of that, the recent news that Oculus founder Palmer Luckey was secretly funding a pro-Trump online trolling campaign has left many developers with a sour taste about the platform as a whole.  Viveport Today, HTC launched another volley in the direction of Oculus with the launch of Viveport. Viveport, which has been available to developers for several weeks in its beta form, is home to Vive games and experiences that you can't even find on the Steam marketplace, though there is a bit of crossover between the two as well.  For PC gamers, Steam has no real competitor, but Viveport doesn't need to compete with Steam to gain an audience or help the Vive become the most popular VR device on the planet. Games and software can launch first on Viveport and still find their way to Steam at a later date, or vice-versa.  So, why would HTC and Valve want to split the market like this, when their jointly developed headset is clearly positioned to take over? To understand that, just ask yourself what exactly the market for VR really is. The short answer: Nobody really knows yet.  It might feel like we've all been hearing about virtual reality forever, but real, capable VR hardware only arrived on the scene in the past couple of years. The Vive's Amazon launch just happened last week.  HTC Viveport HTC For gamers who want to wield virtual assault rifles and launch lasers from their fingertips, the Steam marketplace is already home. But what about everyone else? When the Nintendo Wii began to gain traction—before exploding into a cultural phenomenon—it quickly became clear that the people lining up at 2 o'clock in the morning to buy it weren't your typical early adopters, and the same could be true once VR inevitably reaches critical mass.  For those non-gamers, putting another barrier between them and VR content is simply bad business. With Viveport, those customers can browse a huge library of content that they know will work with the device that they have, without having to filter out non-VR games or games designed for other hardware. Even its competitors' Oculus store hosts content for both the Rift and the Gear VR headsets, meaning that seeing something cool doesn't automatically mean it's made for you.  Software on Viveport is universally accessible in more than 30 countries. Finding something interesting on Viveport is a matter of a mouse click, and the added bonus of region-free support is icing on the cake.  PlayStation VR (PSVR) PSVR is the ultimate question mark in the virtual reality space. Using the most popular game console on the market—the PlayStation 4—as its base unit, the PSVR has a built-in advantage. It also uses the PlayStation Camera and PS Move motion controllers that many people already own, further lowering the barrier of entry and learning curve.  PlayStation VR System w/ PS4 Console PlayStation In terms of hardware specs, it's comparable with the Rift and Vive, though the display resolution of the PSVR is slightly less than that of its competitors. It's priced lower than the Rift and Vive as well, at $399, but where the PSVR really has the potential to shine is in its software.  PlayStation pulls some serious weight when it comes to developer loyalty, and big names are already lining up to support the PSVR either at launch or shortly thereafter. Batman Arkham VR, Eve: Valkyrie, and Resident Evil 7 will undoubtedly tempt many, many gamers into taking the VR plunge first on PlayStation, though we won't know exactly how many until after the device's Oct. 13 launch.  Just the beginning It's an exciting time to be a virtual reality fan. Whether you're an Oculus Rift fan, an HTC Vive owner, or still waiting for the PlayStation VR to arrive before you make your decision, the competition in the market is pushing the industry forward faster than ever. The next 12 to 24 months will show us just who has the longevity and creativity to draw us out of the real world and into theirs.  Apple View all 1068 stories → Facebook View all 702 stories → Is HTC Vive the virtual reality system for you?

First, a sunglasses-wearing man flew into an iRage inside of an Apple store in Dijon, France, walking around the store and methodically smashing iPhones, iPads and computers. Related: Look Incredibly Cool by Mastering These iOS 10 iMessage Features Right Away The incident was captured on video and shows the man coolly destroying thousands of dollars worth of Apple products with a metal bowling ball until a security guard stopped him. The man was apparently ticked off about being refused a refund and alleged Apple "violates customer rights," according to the BBC. Local media reported the man was arrested and a police investigation is underway. Apple declined to comment. The crazy train doesn't stop there, though. An iPhone 7 video hoax made the rounds this week, claiming customers upset about the absence of a traditional headphone jack in their iPhone 7 can drill into the device to reveal a hidden port. While it's unclear how many people fell for the do-it-yourself prank solution, the video has been viewed more than 13 million times. Some enraged commenters even claimed to have tried the DIY hack and complained when it — unsurprisingly — did not work. It's important to consider the source before doing something radical to a device that has a starting price of $649. The video comes from TechRax, whose other videos include "What Happens If You Microwave an iPhone 7?" and "How to Properly Grind an iPhone 6."

Wccftech News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile  ⋮  Notebooks Apple MacBook Pro Rumored For October 24th Launch As More Details Surface By Ramish Zafar Posted 2 months ago 20Shares Share Tweet Submit All done with the launch of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, Apple’s ow focusing aggressively on the MacBook. Reports surrounding the notebook have started to increase as September ends. While we’ve heard some analysts comment that a late September launch might be on the cards, it doesn’t look to be that way. Now, more sources have started to speculate on an October launch for the notebooks. In fact, some have gone as far as to give a precise launch date. Take a look below to find out more. Apple To Launch MacBook Pro In Late October Claim Multiple Sources Apple’s launch of the MacBook has been in the rumor mill for quite a while. The biggest question surrounding this year’s notebook launches from Cupertino is whether we’ll get to see Intel’s Kaby Lake on board. Current word on the street doesn’t make it out to be that way. We’re hearing more about AMD and Polaris’ potential presence on Apple’s product portfolio. Now, multiple sources claim to be in the know-how of the MacBook Pro’s launch date. Both of them believe that the notebook will be launched in late October. It’s believed that Apple’s working on an aggressive schedule. The company’s current focus on macOS 10.12.1 is geared towards catering to hardware upgrades for the lineup. To that end, the MacBook Pro is expected to feature several interesting upgrades this year. Advertisement TheApplePost is also reporting a potential launch date for the MacBook Pro. According to their sources, Apple will launch the notebooks on October 24th. This marks a month until the notebooks are finally unveiled by Cupertino. Furthermore, it’s also believed that Cupertino will seed one more beta version of macOS 10.12.1 to developers and public next week. There’s little information on Cupertino’s plans for the MacBook Air, with some analysts claiming that the gadget will also see an upgrade. The MacBook Pro is expected to feature several upgrades on board. For starters, it’s rumored with an OLED touch bar. This will replace the top function key bar on the notebook, and make for much more interactive methods of input. Secondly, Touch ID is also expected to finally make it on the MacBook Pro. This will also include Apple Pay support as users will get to authenticate their transactions directly from their MacBooks. Thoughts?

Blige’s singing interview of Hillary Clinton on Apple Music is oddly inspiring Written by Amy X. Wang Obsession 2016 September 30, 2016 Huh. (Apple Music) Share Written by Amy X. Wang Obsession 2016 September 30, 2016 More than just a few eyebrows were raised when Apple Music announced earlier this week that R&B artist Mary J. Blige would interview Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in a half-hour segment on Blige’s new show, The 411. That’s largely because the one-minute teaser released by the streaming service was downright uncomfortable—featuring Blige passionately singing about racism and police brutality to a stilted-looking Clinton sitting two feet away. Like you’ve never seen them before.@MaryJBlige sits down with @HillaryClinton.#The411 Coming September 30th.https://t.co/hbaWqfjJcp pic.twitter.com/P2qpm3h3Pm — Apple Music (@AppleMusic) September 27, 2016 The memes all but wrote themselves. Apple Music released the whole interview Sept. 30—which you can watch here, even without an Apple Music subscription—and the conversation between Blige and Clinton actually offers some unexpected depth. Among the topics discussed are leadership lessons Clinton learned from years of watching her husband serve as president, as well as her frustration with her public image. “I do believe that when you’re in the public eye, whether it’s in entertainment or it’s in politics, you do have the challenge of presenting yourself and having people perceive you as who you think you are,” Clinton said. As for Blige’s seemingly out-of-nowhere a capella stunt? The singer explained that she chose to sing lyrics from Bruce Springsteen’s “American Skin” to the presidential candidate in an effort to make Clinton personally feel the frustration of the US’s black community. It worked. Clinton, grasping hands with Blige at one point, said she is “heartbroken” that “African American parents have to sit their children down and deliver the message that you just sang.” Said Clinton, “I think you should sing in every interview that you do. It’s so emotionally powerful, Mary.” Apple Music will soon release a handful more episodes from Blige’s show, which is hosted exclusively on the streaming service. The singer told journalists that none of the others will feature her singing from her seat. Read full story home our picks popular latest obsessions search

The discussions, which are also being held with Alphabet Inc. and Tencent Holdings Ltd., form part of the lender’s efforts to double the number of customers on its mobile-phone platform to 20 million by the end of 2017, Oigara said in an interview at his office in the capital, Nairobi, on Wednesday. The unit, known as KCB Fintech, will officially begin operations in June 2017, he said. The subsidiary will “partner with different players, whether it is M-Pesa, Facebook, Google, Apple and that business will have a new digital-payments platform,” he said. M-Pesa is the mobile-phone payments system pioneered by Vodafone Plc unit Safaricom Ltd., which handled 5.29 trillion shillings ($52 billion) of transactions last year, equivalent to more than 80 percent of the country’s gross domestic product. Banks in East Africa’s biggest economy are scrambling for market share in digital transactions with 25 million mobile-money subscribers spending 312 billion shillings ($3.1 billion) on goods and services in the three months through March, according to data compiled by the Communications Authority of Kenya . Lenders are seeking new sources of revenue after the government capped lending rates, pressuring margins. Double Up KCB is doubling capacity on its mobile-phone systems so it can handle 600 transactions per second by next year, Oigara said. A surge in demand for loans caused the platform to collapse last week. KCB is also in talks with Paypal Holdings Inc., Samsung Electronics Co. and Twitter Inc., Chief Digital Officer Edward Ndichu, who will head KCB Fintech, said in an interview. “This is the journey we are going through,” Ndichu said. “We need to benchmark with the needs of the customer.” Shares in KCB Group have fallen 38 percent this year to 27 shillings by close of Thursday trading in Nairobi. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Evan Niu (TMFNewCow) Sep 30, 2016 at 1:49PM iPhone 7. Image source: Apple. Geographically speaking, investors are well aware of where Apple, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) priorities lie. Greater China is one of the company's main growth engines at this point, and continues to march toward a day when it overtakes the U.S. business. CEO Tim Cook has predicted this will occur within the next few years, but right now the U.S. is still about $25 billion larger on a trailing-12-month basis. India is the next big country to tackle, while Apple slowly continues to build out its operations in Russia. That covers three of the BRIC countries. But what about the "B"? Brazil is just part of the picture It wasn't until early 2014 that Apple opened its first retail store in Brazil, and there are currently only two stores within the country. Beyond just Brazil, it may surprise you to learn that Apple's business in Canada and South America combined is actually extremely small. Apple reports Americas as a geographical operating segment, while separately disclosing the international mix of sales in its earnings releases. We can use the inverse of this figure to calculate Apple's domestic U.S. revenue, and then compare that to the broader Americas segment. Here's what we get if we back out U.S. revenue from Americas revenue. Data source: SEC filings, author's calculations. Graph by author. Americas ex-U.S. revenue, which would include all of Canada and all of South America, is typically only in the ballpark of $3 billion per quarter, plus or minus a billion or so. (The average since 2014 is $2.8 billion per quarter.) Apple has been doing quite well in emerging markets recently with various initiatives intended to make iPhones more affordable. To be clear, Apple has long faced headwinds in Brazil, mostly in the form of massive import tariffs that make it the most expensive country in the world to buy an iPhone. The whole only-two-stores-in-the-country thing doesn't help, either (even though Apple sells through third-party distributors). The Brazilian real has also been fairly volatile in recent years, making it tricky for Apple to properly price its products as it must navigate currency translation effects (net of hedging). Put another way, Canada and South America represent about 5% of overall revenue. It's true that the BRIC countries have experienced slowing growth and other macroeconomic headwinds recently, but it still feels like Apple could be doing more to expand its business in Canada and South America.
