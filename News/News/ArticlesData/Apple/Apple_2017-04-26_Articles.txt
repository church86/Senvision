Read More Faling victim to hackers has long been a scary situation for net-savvy youths, but this hacker has made a specific target to a group of Pune-based aspiring models to prise open their multiple online IDs, while threatening them over the phone from a Pakistan number that all their private pictures would also be uploaded on fake social media accounts that he had created. At least 15 girls have lodged a complaint with the cybercrime cell of the Pune police. However, over 60 such women — who are yet to lodge a formal complaint — said their Apple, Facebook, Snapchat and e-mail IDs had already been hacked. The person initially hacked one girl's account on April 12, and then through her account, spoke to several of her friends. Claiming to be that girl, the hacker spoke to her friends and asked for their e-mail IDs and numbers to add them to the girl's "Apple circle". The "circle" was apparently created by the hacker under the pretext of trying to get their votes to win the girl a photoshoot competition. "My account got hacked through one of my friends. It is now being used to gain access to multiple accounts using my identity. I got a message from my friend around 4.15 pm, asking me to vote for her photoshoot with a link, after which the hacker asked me for my Apple ID and phone number, and add me to an 'inner circle' to increase the number of votes. At 5.45 pm, my Apple iCloud ID account got hacked. The hacker changed all the details and security questions also. Around 10 pm that day, my Facebook got hacked; all my data got erased and phone got locked," reads the application submitted to the cybercrime cell by a victim, who was among the first few from Pune to have lost all social media data. This is the same modus operandi that he used with all the accounts that he had hacked. The hacker has been able to do so even with someone simply clicking on a link that he would send from one of the hacked accounts. "When we stop replying to the hacker's messages, we get a call from a Pakistan number. He claims to be our friends' friend and then asks us to send the code at the earliest," claims one of the victims. He claims that he is actually doing it as a favour for the girl who is a friend, the victim added. One of the other girls, who also submitted an application to the cybercrime cell, mentioned in her complaint that when the hacker called her, he claimed to be Burhaan from Pakistan. She said, "The hacker even messaged and harassed one of the other victims by creating a fake Facebook profile and by uploading private pictures of her. He even threatened her to make more fake profiles under her name, saying that he will make her life hell." When Mirror contacted Manisha Zhende, police inspector at the cybercrime cell, she said, "We have requested Facebook for all the details from the IP (internet protocol) addresses that have been used, but this might take some time. If the hacker is from Pakistan, as is being claimed, then getting permissions to inquire or even make an arrest will take much longer time because of the permissions involved." Addressing the issue of hacking, which is quite rampant, Zhende added, "It is our request to people to completely avoid talking to strangers and not to even click on any link that anyone provides them with, no matter how trusted the source might be." ¦ The hacker even threatened a fellow victim that he would make more fake profiles under her name, stressing that he would make her 'life hell' — One of the victims Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.

Under Trump's proposals, American companies would move from being the most highly taxed among the Group of 20 countries to among the lowest. Tax rates would fall below those of neighbouring Mexico and Canada, which Trump has accused of shortchanging the United States in trade deals. Corporate leaders and business lobbying groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce on Wednesday cheered the administration's tax proposals, while allowing that the initial one-page plan left out crucial details. The tax plan, which includes a cut in taxes on public companies to 15 percent from 35 percent, does not detail cuts in spending that would help keep the budget deficit under control. AT&T Corp Chief Executive Randall Stephenson welcomed the tax plan but cautioned "the practical reality of getting to 15 percent is you have to get yourself reconciled to some level of deficits for a period of time as you get the economic stimulation." Big U.S. companies have nearly $1.8 trillion in cash stockpiled overseas, according to Moody's Investors Service. Technology powerhouse Apple Inc has more than $200 billion of that total. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday, but Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook has said the company was looking to bring back offshore cash if tax rates for doing so were lower. "What we would do with it, let's wait and see exactly what it is, but as I've said before we are always looking at acquisitions," Cook told investors on the company's first-quarter earnings call in January. Cook's comment points to a big unknown for the White House and congressional Republicans, who have said business tax cuts would result in more and better jobs. Studies of the results of past tax holidays found that most of the offshore cash brought home by U.S. companies was used to buy back shares or make acquisitions, not to fund investments in production capacity or jobs. Under pressure from shareholders, listed companies have set high targets for return on invested capital. General Motors Co , for example, has told investors it is aiming for 20 percent returns on its capital investments. Many U.S. companies have been tightfisted about investing in new plants and equipment following the last recession, which left them wary of becoming overextended. Since 2014, investment in new equipment has flatlined, according to government data. A MIXED BAG The financial impact of the White House tax plan will vary widely by company and business sector. A proposal to cut inheritance taxes, for example, is of high interest to auto dealers, which are often family-controlled enterprises. Many companies already pay less than the headline 35 percent tax rate. Companies in the S&P 500 index paid an average tax rate of 29.06 percent for 2016, Standard and Poors said. A change of a few percentage points in tax rates can make a big difference. Aircraft maker Boeing Co on Wednesday reported a 19 percent increase in first quarter profits, partly because of a 4 percentage-point drop in its tax rate. "At the highest level we're a big supporter of tax reform," Boeing Chief Financial Officer Greg Smith told analysts and journalists on a call Wednesday. "It's going to drive jobs, it's going to drive the U.S. economy broadly speaking and it's going to allow us to compete." Boeing has been cutting jobs in the United States, warning employees last week that it planned another round of cuts that would eliminate hundreds of engineering jobs. While the tax cuts may produce a short-term boost to the economy and add fuel to a stock market rally, it falls short of the comprehensive tax reform that Trump had pledged earlier. Regarding other parts of his agenda, his administration has been stymied in its attempts to limit immigration by the courts, while an attempt to repeal and replace Obamacare failed in Congress. “A cynic would say this is a rushed attempt to have something big to show for President Trump’s first 100 days in office," said Luke Bartholomew, investment strategist at Aberdeen Asset Management in London.

By: Chandrika Jana Updated: Thursday, April 27, 2017, 11:44 [IST] While Apple is going to launch three iPhones this year, the iPhone 8 is undoubtedly the most anticipated one. As September draws close, almost every other day a new rumor about the upcoming iPhone comes up. Now, a blueprint revealing the internal components of the phone has surfaced online. Keeping in line with some of the previous rumors, it says that the 10th-anniversary model will be dubbed as the iPhone X. Up until now, we have seen a countless number of leaks regarding the features and specs of the iPhone 8, and most of them have indicated us that it will feature dual cameras at the back. Also Read: Apple iPhone 8: Specs, design, availability, concept video and more This blueprint suggests the same. As you can see, the phone is likely to come with a vertically arranged, rear dual-camera setup. The cameras are housed at the top left corner, just like that of on the iPhone 7 Plus. The blueprint further reveals that the iPhone 8 will come equipped with Apple's new generation processor, the A11 chip. The new chip will be apparently placed below the WiFi and SIM module. You can also see a 3D camera and an infrared biometric scanner at the top of the full vision display. In addition to this, the upcoming iPhone is said to come with dual batteries under its hood. Contradicting some of the earlier rumors, the blueprint shows that the fingerprint scanner will be located on the front of the device. Another noteworthy thing we have come to know from the blueprint is that the iPhone 8 is expected to feature dual speakers. Of course, like all the other rumors, its authenticity is not determined. In any case, we have to wait until the official launch of iPhone 8 in September.

Pear Technology, which produces digital mapping software and services, applied for the pear logo in 2014 and was almost immediately challenged by Apple, which claimed it was confusingly similar to its own apple-with-a-bite-out-of-it silhouette logo. The Cupertino intellectual property lawyers claimed that despite one being a picture of a pear and one being a picture of an apple they were, legally, the same. How? Here are the words that make this leap of logic possible: "abstract stylization" and "sleek, rounded silhouettes of the fruits." As opposed to the jagged, spiky pears that you see in the supermarket all the time. Even though the Pear Technologies trademark application had the word "Pear Technologies" written underneath as part of the mark, this mere detail was not enough to prevent consumers from being confused as to the difference between a pear and an apple, it seems. The name Pear Technologies "must be assessed against the background of the fact that the word, where understood, merely reinforces the same concept as the one attributed to the sign's figurative element, thus creating a semantic unit." And that's not even Apple's lawyer talking – that is the decision of the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) which actually ruled for Apple and against Pear Technologies. Nothing at all? Surely they were able to see some variation in the two pictures – again, one being of a pear and one being of an apple? "Admittedly, the arrangement of the oblong shapes differs in each sign, as, in the earlier mark, the leaf is angled to the right and stands separately from the apple shape, whereas in the contested sign, the stalk leans to the left and is attached to the pear-shape." Uh-huh. Anything else? "Moreover, the signs differ in the specific shapes of the figurative elements, the fact that the contested sign features a grey shape with a black outline whereas the earlier mark is a solid black image, and the verbal element 'Pear Technologies' which has no counterpart in the earlier mark." Normally, you would expect someone noticing that "the signs differ in the specific shapes of the figurative elements" would be enough to decide that they are actually two different things – but no. However, these differences do not counter the visual similarity of the earlier mark to the image included in the contested sign ... Considering the foregoing deliberations from a visual perspective, the overall image arising from the graphic features of the pear in the contested sign would call to the relevant consumer's mind the earlier reputed trademark. If all that isn't a textbook illustration of how over-paid lawyers use fancy words to try to hide a mountain of horseshit logic, we don't know what is. But Apple won. Not only with this logo but also with another Pear Technologies logo that bears even less resemblance to the Apple logo. A pear made up of lots of different-sized squares no less. And then, it won again after Pear Technologies appealed and lost. We swear we're not making this up. In case you can't tell, the pear is on the left Nor are we making up that last month Apple went to court in Switzerland to prevent Swatch from using the advertising line "Tick Different" because, it claims, it infringes its "Think Different" tagline that it hasn't used for 20 years. Which just goes to show, when it comes to trademarks, money talks and bullshit... bullshit is used to justify the decision. ® Tips and corrections 26 Comments MORE Apple Intellectual Property Trademark More from The Register Apple finally teaches Android music app to validate certificates Cupertino's so keen on Android it took eight months to repair interception bug 3 Comments Apple squashes cert-handling bug affecting macOS and iOS Flaw posed remote code execution risk 10 Comments Speaking in Tech: Glassholes are COOL now Apple's doing it Podcast Plus, Lego tape, the decline of Uber, Brexit for dummies and more! 4 Comments Apple Watch exec Bob Mansfield 'gets into secret Apple car' Here in iCar, iCan only receive, iCan listen to you... 43 Comments Apple accused of counter-revolutionary pricing in Russia Tovarishch Cook accused of sending retailers to gulag unless they follow price list 6 Comments Apple Store in Pennsylvania hit with discrimination complaint Ex-worker claims African-American shoppers were targeted 36 Comments Whitepapers The Path to Hybrid Cloud With these advances and the ability to choose between a local data center and multiple public cloud offerings.

Twitter Facebook Samsung will launch new flagship smartphone months after Galaxy S8 The South Korean giant warned about tougher competition ahead of Apple’s annual iPhone launch. IDG John Ribeiro (IDG News Service) 27 April, 2017 13:58 - - - - print email Comments Samsung Electronics said Thursday it was planning to launch in the second half of this year a new flagship phone, leading to speculation that the company is planning an alternative to the ill-fated Galaxy Note7 that had to be recalled last year. The launch of a new flagship smartphone this year and continuing sales of the Galaxy S8 and S8+ will help Samsung counter Apple’s launch of a new version of its iPhone. Apple usually unveils new phones in September. "Samsung does announce a S series phone in the first half of the year and a Note series in the second half," said Kiranjeet Kaur, research manager for client devices at IDC Asia/Pacific. "So I am not sure if Samsung is alluding to the next Note or if they want to introduce a new series to avoid any questions or doubts that may arise because of the Note7 debacle." Samsung could not be immediately reached for comment. The company started shipping its Galaxy S8 and S8+ smartphones from April 21 in the U.S. and certain other markets. The company said pre-orders for the two smartphones were higher than they had been for the predecessor Galaxy S7 and S7 edge, launched in March last year. The S8 ran into complaints about red-tinted screens and problems with the Wi-Fi connection for which the company is reportedly issuing a software fix. The company also decided that the voice feature on its Bixby voice-activated personal assistant would be available in the U.S. only later in the spring. Samsung stopped production of the Note7 in October after complaints that the phone batteries had in some cases overheated and even exploded. The company blamed batteries supplied by two manufacturers for the problem. On Thursday, the company’s IT & Mobile Communications (IM) division, which includes the company’s smartphone business, reported a drop in revenue and profits in the first quarter, which the company blamed on adjustments of the prices of the S7 and S7 edge. The revenue of the division was down by close to 15 percent to 23.5 trillion won (US$20.7 billion) from 27.6 trillion won in the same quarter last year, the company said Thursday. Operating profit also dropped by 47 percent to nearly 4 trillion won. Smartphone shipments increased slightly in the quarter because of the newly released mid-range Galaxy A 2017 series and strong sales in emerging markets of mid- to low-end phones, Samsung said. The new flagship smartphone and the global rollout of the Galaxy S8 and S8+ are expected to help the division increase revenue and profit. But the company said that competition is expected to intensify in the second half as a result of the rollout of new smartphones by rivals, in what appears to be a reference to Apple’s launch of a new version of the iPhone later this year. Samsung cannot ignore the impending launch of the 10th anniversary iPhone as there is already so much hype building around it, Kaur said. In emerging markets such as India and Indonesia, Chinese vendors such as Oppo and Vivo have been relentless in their pursuit of market share, she added. “They are doing this in the mid-range segment which is very important for Samsung as well in these markets,” she added. Samsung said it will look to stay profitable in the mid- to low-end segment by launching new products and streamlining its lineup. The company’s overall revenue growth in the first quarter was almost flat at 50.55 trillion won in the first quarter. The operating profit grew by 48 percent to 9.9 trillion won mainly on stronger demand for the company’s components like memories and displays. 7 Habits of the Effective Network Manager More from NetScout Join the Computerworld newsletter!

John Ribeiro (IDG News Service) 27 April, 2017 13:58 - - - - print email Comments IDG Samsung Electronics said Thursday it was planning to launch in the second half of this year a new flagship phone, leading to speculation that the company is planning an alternative to the ill-fated Galaxy Note7 that had to be recalled last year. The launch of a new flagship smartphone this year and continuing sales of the Galaxy S8 and S8+ will help Samsung counter Apple’s launch of a new version of its iPhone. Apple usually unveils new phones in September. "Samsung does announce a S series phone in the first half of the year and a Note series in the second half," said Kiranjeet Kaur, research manager for client devices at IDC Asia/Pacific. "So I am not sure if Samsung is alluding to the next Note or if they want to introduce a new series to avoid any questions or doubts that may arise because of the Note7 debacle." Samsung could not be immediately reached for comment. The company started shipping its Galaxy S8 and S8+ smartphones from April 21 in the U.S. and certain other markets. The company said pre-orders for the two smartphones were higher than they had been for the predecessor Galaxy S7 and S7 edge, launched in March last year. The S8 ran into complaints about red-tinted screens and problems with the Wi-Fi connection for which the company is reportedly issuing a software fix. The company also decided that the voice feature on its Bixby voice-activated personal assistant would be available in the U.S. only later in the spring. Samsung stopped production of the Note7 in October after complaints that the phone batteries had in some cases overheated and even exploded. The company blamed batteries supplied by two manufacturers for the problem. On Thursday, the company’s IT & Mobile Communications (IM) division, which includes the company’s smartphone business, reported a drop in revenue and profits in the first quarter, which the company blamed on adjustments of the prices of the S7 and S7 edge. The revenue of the division was down by close to 15 percent to 23.5 trillion won (US$20.7 billion) from 27.6 trillion won in the same quarter last year, the company said Thursday. Operating profit also dropped by 47 percent to nearly 4 trillion won. Smartphone shipments increased slightly in the quarter because of the newly released mid-range Galaxy A 2017 series and strong sales in emerging markets of mid- to low-end phones, Samsung said. The new flagship smartphone and the global rollout of the Galaxy S8 and S8+ are expected to help the division increase revenue and profit. But the company said that competition is expected to intensify in the second half as a result of the rollout of new smartphones by rivals, in what appears to be a reference to Apple’s launch of a new version of the iPhone later this year. Samsung cannot ignore the impending launch of the 10th anniversary iPhone as there is already so much hype building around it, Kaur said. In emerging markets such as India and Indonesia, Chinese vendors such as Oppo and Vivo have been relentless in their pursuit of market share, she added. “They are doing this in the mid-range segment which is very important for Samsung as well in these markets,” she added. Samsung said it will look to stay profitable in the mid- to low-end segment by launching new products and streamlining its lineup. The company’s overall revenue growth in the first quarter was almost flat at 50.55 trillion won in the first quarter. The operating profit grew by 48 percent to 9.9 trillion won mainly on stronger demand for the company’s components like memories and displays. ​CIO Executive Council member profile: Emmanuel Steve Dulvin More from CIO Executive Council Join the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

Under Trump's proposals, American companies would move from being the most highly taxed among the Group of 20 (G-20) countries to among the lowest. Tax rates would fall below those of neighbouring Mexico and Canada, which Trump has accused of shortchanging the United States in trade deals. Corporate leaders and business lobbying groups such as the US Chamber of Commerce on Wednesday (April 26) cheered the administration's tax proposals, while allowing that the initial one-page plan left out crucial details. The tax plan, which includes a cut in taxes on public companies to 15 per cent from 35 per cent, does not detail cuts in spending that would help keep the budget deficit under control. AT&T Corp Chief Executive Randall Stephenson welcomed the tax plan but cautioned "the practical reality of getting to 15 per cent is you have to get yourself reconciled to some level of deficits for a period of time as you get the economic stimulation."   asiastocks.jpg Related Story Asian shares retreat from highs on doubts over Trump tax plan   fed.jpg Related Story Fed, wary of inflation, could lean against Trump tax cut Big US companies have nearly US$1.8 trillion (S$2.5 trillion) in cash stockpiled overseas, according to Moody's Investors Service.

Cook's comment points to a big unknown for the White House and congressional Republicans, who have said business tax cuts would result in more and better jobs. Studies of the results of past tax holidays found that most of the offshore cash brought home by US companies was used to buy back shares or make acquisitions, not to fund investments in production capacity or jobs. Under pressure from shareholders, listed companies have set high targets for return on invested capital. General Motors Co , for example, has told investors it is aiming for 20 percent returns on its capital investments. Many US companies have been tightfisted about investing in new plants and equipment following the last recession, which left them wary of becoming overextended. Since 2014, investment in new equipment has flatlined, according to government data. A MIXED BAG The financial impact of the White House tax plan will vary widely by company and business sector. A proposal to cut inheritance taxes, for example, is of high interest to auto dealers, which are often family-controlled enterprises. Many companies already pay less than the headline 35 per cent tax rate. Companies in the S&P 500 index paid an average tax rate of 29.06 per cent for 2016, Standard and Poors said. A change of a few percentage points in tax rates can make a big difference. Aircraft maker Boeing Co on Wednesday reported a 19 per cent increase in first quarter profits, partly because of a 4 percentage-point drop in its tax rate. "At the highest level we're a big supporter of tax reform,"Boeing Chief Financial Officer Greg Smith told analysts and journalists on a call on Wednesday. "It's going to drive jobs, it's going to drive the US economy broadly speaking and it's going to allow us to compete." Boeing has been cutting jobs in the United States, warning employees last week that it planned another round of cuts that would eliminate hundreds of engineering jobs. While the tax cuts may produce a short-term boost to the economy and add fuel to a stock market rally, it falls short of the comprehensive tax reform that Trump had pledged earlier. Regarding other parts of his agenda, his administration has been stymied in its attempts to limit immigration by the courts, while an attempt to repeal and replace Obamacare failed in Congress. "A cynic would say this is a rushed attempt to have something big to show for President Trump's first 100 days in office," said Luke Bartholomew, investment strategist at Aberdeen Asset Management in London.

(AAPL) Just Painted a Target on Samsung’s (SSNLF) Back Apple’s LuxVue could replace the OLED display debuting with the iPhone 8 By Brad Moon, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Apr 26, 2017, 1:40 pm EDT Get AAPL alerts: Submit     Popular Posts: Intel Corporation (INTC) Reportedly Rushing New Chips Because of AMD’s Ryzen Apple Inc. (AAPL) Faces iPhone 8 Delay as Galaxy S8 Shatters Sales Records Apple Inc. Wants to Make Recycled iPhones Recent Posts: Apple Inc. (AAPL) Just Painted a Target on Samsung’s (SSNLF) Back Apple Inc. (AAPL) Faces iPhone 8 Delay as Galaxy S8 Shatters Sales Records What Apple Inc. (AAPL) Self-Driving Car Technology Looks Like View All Posts Two themes have dominated tech industry news the past few weeks: Samsung Electronics’ (OTCMKTS:SSNLF) faster-than-expected recovery from its Galaxy Note 7 exploding battery disaster and Apple Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) track record of punishing iPhone component suppliers. Source: Apple The two stories converge in a new report out of Korea alleging that Apple is working on micro-LED display technology to replace the OLED panels it’s expected to buy from Samsung. It’s also in talks to replace Samsung as its iPhone memory supplier. Samsung is expected to be the primary supplier for the iPhone 8, providing the NAND flash memory, DRAM and the OLED display panels. But if Apple follows through with its plans, it may manage to purge Samsung altogether from its most popular product. Apple Inc.’s Quiet Investment in Micro-LED In 2014, Apple bought LuxVue Technology. The small company was working on low power, micro-LED displays for consumer electronics. No one read a whole lot into the purchase, as Apple had acquired 24 small tech companies during an 18-month period at the time. Business Korea reports that Apple Inc. is preparing to put micro-LED displays into mass production late in 2017, however, using them for the Apple Watch 3. They would replace the OLED displays used in the first two models, with the advantage of being thinner and lighter. As a result, LG — the supplier of those Apple Watch OLED displays — is expected to take a $200 million-plus hit. The bigger story is OLED displays for iPhones. AAPL is expected to turn to OLED displays for the iPhone 8, and Samsung has reportedly invested billions of dollars to ramp up its production capacity to meet demand. According to the Business Korea story, if the Apple Watch 3 display is a success, Apple plans to leverage the technology to use its own micro-LED displays on iPhones, replacing OLED. Besides being thinner and lighter, AppleInsider points out that AAPL and LuxVue are working on the ability for micro-LED displays to integrate Touch ID capability. Issues around Touch ID with OLED displays and the removal of the Home button are largely being blamed for apparent iPhone 8 production delays. If Apple Inc. can solve that problem using its own technology, that’s just another reason to ditch OLED. Kicking Samsung Out of the Henhouse Business Korea also points out another Apple move: The company is bidding on the memory chip business of Toshiba Corp NPV (OTCMKTS:TOSBF). If successful, that means Apple would be able to replace Samsung memory chips with its own in future iPhones. I’ve written recently about Apple’s push to move key iPhone components in-house, sometimes pulling the rug out from under long-time suppliers. Even a massive company like Samsung takes risks when it deals with Apple. The payoff can be huge — that’s why Samsung is willing to build up manufacturing capacity for iPhone 8 OLED displays. But Samsung isn’t immune from Apple’s strategy. In fact, with the Galaxy S8 doing unexpectedly well, even as Samsung technology is fingered as a possible cause for iPhone 8 delays, SSNLF has a target on its back. If the micro-LED displays for the Apple Watch 3 perform well, Samsung had better start making alternate plans for its ramped up OLED capacity. As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Unfortunately that did not exactly happen. While the Apple Watch isn’t exactly a flop, it wasn’t really the game-changer we expected. This is why it doesn’t really come as a surprise to learn that two years following its launch, consumer interest in the device might have peaked. According to a report from CNBC, they quote a survey conducted by Fluent in which it was found that interest in Apple’s wearable might have already peaked. The survey polled 1,339 consumers and according to a Fluent spokeswoman, “Customer excitement for the Apple Watch has plateaued since hitting the market in 2015. Only current owners think it’s a great product, but nearly half of them don’t plan on upgrading.” The survey found that only 49% of Apple Watch owners plan on upgrading their device, versus the 62% when surveyed last year. While this hardly means that the Apple Watch is doomed for failure, it shows that maybe Apple hasn’t quite hit the nail on the head just yet. Perhaps that could change in the Apple Watch Series 3, but we’ll just have to wait and see. Filed in Apple >Gadgets. Read more about Apple Watch, Smartwatch and Wearable Tech.

The app can’t follow you around and know your whereabouts. But app developers can engage in "tagging," leaving behind a unique ID on an iPhone so the developer can recall the apps that were on it and the last Wi-Fi network the phone was logged onto. These marks are used to help a company prove that the phone belonged to an individual, says Joseph Jerome, privacy & data policy counsel for the Center for Democracy and Technology. The subject became hotly debated online this week in response to a New York Times profile of ride-hailing app Uber.  Uber had marked iPhones with persistent digital ID tags that would remain after users had deleted the Uber app and wiped the phone, the Times said. Apple CEO Tim Cook scolded Uber CEO Travis Kalanick for the practice, but didn't kick Uber out of the App Store. Today, Uber says it doesn’t track users or their location once they’ve deleted the app, but it does hold onto tagging data collected as a check against “fraudsters from loading Uber onto a stolen phone, putting in a stolen credit card, taking an expensive ride and then wiping the phone—over and over again," the company told USA TODAY in a statement.  Blogger John Gruber, whose Daring Fireball is targeted to app developers, noted that Apple ditched earlier iPhone tools like UDID (Unique Device ID) and Mac addresses for developers several years back (in 2012) because they were “being abused by privacy invasive ad trackers, analytics packages,” and companies like Uber. Uber notes that Apple does allows limited use of fingerprinting, and "merely stipulates which identifiers can be collected from the device, which are used by our team in combination with non-device signals to detect fraudulent activity & suspicious logins." © diego_cervo, Getty Images/iStockphoto It's possible for app developers to identify an iPhone after the app's been removed, but Apple has set stricter privacy limits on what they can do. Would it be more than that, “tracking someone after they’ve deleted their app is problematic unless you’ve signed away your rights in the privacy policy,” notes Scott Vernick, the chair of the privacy and data security practice at Philadelphia law firm Fox Rothschild. If app developers could truly track you after you’ve deleted the app, it would “violate Apple developer terms and show a giant security hole in,” the iOS operating system, says Jerome.  The consumer tips for how to protect your privacy are few. You could try living without apps on your smartphone—go without Uber, Facebook, Google Maps and the like, and your daily activities won’t be tracked. (The phone is the worst abuser of tracking, because it monitors your location, in return for cars showing up to pick you up and GPS directions getting you from where you are to the destination.) But, “this is not possible today,” says Setu Kulkarni, a vice-president with WhiteHat Security. “Apps are how business will be done in the many decades to come.” Kulkarni suggests consumers think twice about signing up for apps through Facebook and Google, which are offered as ways to speed up the process and eliminate the typing in of name, address and other information. “Do you really want the app to access your friend and contacts data?” he asks. “Be cognizant about what the app can access.” Jerome is hoping to hear how Google and Apple, which have upcoming developer conferences in May and June, will clamp down on how the folks who make apps keep tabs of their customers and set new security policies. “They really need to address this.” Tim Bajarin, the president of Creative Strategies, expects Apple to stress user privacy at its Apple Worldwide Developers Conference. "It's always a big topic," he says. "Apple stresses personal privacy of data at every WWDC." Apple and Google didn’t respond to requests for comment.

The email asked for her credit card and Social Security numbers. She contacted Apple and was told it does not send out such emails. She gave her Social Security number, but not her credit card number. Tuesday, April 18 An unknown individual took a cart full of groceries totaling $367.06 from a Southwestern Boulevard grocery store. When the woman was approached by an employee, she left the cart and fled to a vehicle. An Orchard Park man received a letter from TD Ameritrade thanking him for setting up an account. The man did not set up an account and contacted the company. An Orchard Park juvenile received a video from another Orchard Park juvenile through a social media site threatening to “shoot up” Orchard Park High School. Officers spoke with the person in question who said the video was a joke. The school suspended the individual. Wednesday, April 19 A hit-and-run took place on North Buffalo Street. A vehicle rear-ended another car and fled north on Union Road. The vehicle was described as a blue or green Ford Escape with a female driver. No vehicle was found. Thursday, April 20 A vehicle fire took place on Route 219 near Armor Duells Road. The fire was contained inside the driver’s side door. The driver, a Cheektowaga man, said he was driving north on Route 219 when he felt the driver’s side door get hot. At the same time, the passenger side window dropped in the doorframe. He then observed flames inside the driver’s side door. The man suffered no injuries. A vehicle was stopped on Orchard Park Road because the driver was on his cellphone. The Buffalo man admitted he was using his GPS to locate a business. The man also had two suspensions on his vehicle. He was given tickets for the cellphone violation and aggravated unlicensed operation in the third degree. Friday, April 21 An unknown individual left a riding lawnmower in a driveway on Armor Duells Road. The lawnmower had a full tank of gas and the keys were inside. The lawnmower did not belong to anyone in the neighborhood. Saturday, April 22 A vehicle was stopped on Abbott Road near Penhurst Street for a suspended registration. The suspension was due to parking violations. The Orchard Park man was charged with having a suspended registration. A Buffalo woman allegedly took six items of makeup worth more than $160 from a department store on Amelia Drive. She was charged with petit larceny and criminal possession of stolen property in the fifth degree. Sunday, April 23 A vehicle was stopped for going through the red light at the intersection of Milestrip Road and Sterling Drive. The officer allegedly smelled the strong odor of unburnt marijuana. The Rochester man said there was marijuana in the center console. The officer reportedly found seven bags of marijuana in the console. The driver said all the bags were his and he smokes a lot. He was charged with passed red light and unlawful possession of marijuana. (Editor’s note: The Bee’s police blotter is a sampling of unusual calls received by the police department.

Their renewable energy projects will produce over 12 MW of solar power — more than the energy they need for Apple manufacturing — and support Japan’s nationwide efforts to limit its carbon emissions. “These innovative new clean energy investments demonstrate our commitment to doing business responsibly and economically,” said Kyoichi Yamanaka, Managing Director of Ibiden’s Environment Group. “Our products help Apple devices run smarter, and now we’re powering our operations with smarter energy too. We’re pleased to partner with Apple and lead the way in helping Japan meet its clean energy goals.” Apple and its suppliers will be generating over 2.5 billion kilowatt hours per year of clean energy for the manufacturing of Apple products by the end of 2018 — equal to taking over 400,000 cars off the road for a year. Apple has taken significant steps to protect the environment by transitioning from fossil fuels to clean energy. Today, the company is powering 100 percent of its operations in 23 countries, and more than 93 percent of its worldwide operations, with renewable energy.

Under Trump’s proposals, American companies would move from being the most highly taxed among the Group of 20 countries to among the lowest. Tax rates would fall below those of neighboring Mexico and Canada, which Trump has accused of shortchanging the United States in trade deals. Corporate leaders and business lobbying groups such as the US Chamber of Commerce yesterday cheered the administration’s tax proposals, while allowing that the initial one-page plan left out crucial details. The tax plan, which includes a cut in taxes on public companies to 15 per cent from 35 per cent, does not detail cuts in spending that would help keep the budget deficit under control. AT&T Corp chief executive Randall Stephenson welcomed the tax plan but cautioned “the practical reality of getting to 15 per cent is you have to get yourself reconciled to some level of deficits for a period of time as you get the economic stimulation.” Big US companies have nearly US1.8 trillion (RM7.83 trillion) in cash stockpiled overseas, according to Moody’s Investors Service. Technology powerhouse Apple Inc has more than US200 billion of that total. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment yesterday, but chief executive officer Tim Cook has said the company was looking to bring back offshore cash if tax rates for doing so were lower. “What we would do with it, let’s wait and see exactly what it is, but as I’ve said before we are always looking at acquisitions,” Cook told investors on the company’s first-quarter earnings call in January. Cook’s comment points to a big unknown for the White House and congressional Republicans, who have said business tax cuts would result in more and better jobs. Studies of the results of past tax holidays found that most of the offshore cash brought home by US companies was used to buy back shares or make acquisitions, not to fund investments in production capacity or jobs. Under pressure from shareholders, listed companies have set high targets for return on invested capital. General Motors, for example, has told investors it is aiming for 20 per cent returns on its capital investments. Many US companies have been tightfisted about investing in new plants and equipment following the last recession, which left them wary of becoming overextended. Since 2014, investment in new equipment has flatlined, according to government data. A mixed bag The financial impact of the White House tax plan will vary widely by company and business sector. A proposal to cut inheritance taxes, for example, is of high interest to auto dealers, which are often family-controlled enterprises. Many companies already pay less than the headline 35 per cent tax rate. Companies in the S&P 500 index paid an average tax rate of 29.06 per cent for 2016, Standard and Poors said. A change of a few percentage points in tax rates can make a big difference. Aircraft maker Boeing Co yesterday reported a 19 per cent increase in first quarter profits, partly because of a 4 percentage-point drop in its tax rate. “At the highest level we’re a big supporter of tax reform,” Boeing chief financial officer Greg Smith told analysts and journalists on a call yesterday. “It’s going to drive jobs, it’s going to drive the US economy broadly speaking and it’s going to allow us to compete.” Boeing has been cutting jobs in the United States, warning employees last week that it planned another round of cuts that would eliminate hundreds of engineering jobs. While the tax cuts may produce a short-term boost to the economy and add fuel to a stock market rally, it falls short of the comprehensive tax reform that Trump had pledged earlier. Regarding other parts of his agenda, his administration has been stymied in its attempts to limit immigration by the courts, while an attempt to repeal and replace Obamacare failed in Congress. “A cynic would say this is a rushed attempt to have something big to show for President Trump’s first 100 days in office,” said Luke Bartholomew, investment strategist at Aberdeen Asset Management in London. — Reuters                 MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Saudis, oil majors discuss gas investments ahead of giant IPO Ringgit opens at 4.3490/3550 against US greenback Ivanka Trump to discuss fund for women with World Bank Trump’s taxes slash seen as ‘guidepost’ by Republicans (VIDEO) Bursa shares open marginally lower, but later turned higher Saudis, oil majors discuss gas investments ahead of giant IPO Petronas Dagangan registers record profit in 34 years Why are global players chasing Proton?

It's convenient to see the content of a voicemail at a glance, as it often takes longer to listen to an entire message than to skip to the relevant parts. Apart from increased accuracy, the beta feature works well enough that we see little room for initial improvement. Souped-up Siri Siri was the first eponymous virtual assistant to hit our smartphones, but since then similar and competing technologies like Alexa, Cortana and Google Assistant have eclipsed Siri in function. Siri could be improved in any number of ways, but high on our wish list is better app integration. As of now, Siri can't follow simple commands like "Post to Instagram" nor can it understand the context of your current apps and activities. Considering the competition, Siri shouldn't just be a hands-free way to control your phone. It should also be able to make performing certain tasks with voice control easier than could be done manually. We also wish for an option for Siri to default to Google search results instead of Bing's, but, given Apple's and Google's contentious history, we won't hold our breath for that. Right now, you have to include the word "Google" in your voice command to get those results. Compelling uses for 3D Touch Apple introduced 3D Touch, its pressure-sensitive touchscreen technology, in the iPhone 6S. In 3D Touch-equipped devices, you can navigate differently based on how long and hard you press the display. For example, if you hold lightly on an app icon, it prompts the shaking-icon delete screen, but if you deep press an app icon, an app-specific contextual menu launches. There is lots of potential for 3D Touch, but we've yet to see it really come to fruition. iOS 10 introduced a greater number of deep-press shortcuts, but not many that significantly enhance the experience. So far, one of our favorite applications of 3D Touch is found in Velapp, a video app that creates a highlight reel based on your pressing action during recording. Apple could take a cue and integrate similar conveniences into its camera. Another idea: 3D Touch could also allow you to navigate with one finger in circumstances where you would normally need two. For example, it some instances it might be convenient to to deep press to zoom in and out on an image instead of being limited to the current pinching action. We hope Apple takes the convenience of one-handed operation into account when expanding uses for 3D Touch. Of course, we don't expect Apple to go all in with 3D Touch quite yet, simply because many current iOS devices (specifically, the iPhone SE and the entire iPad lineup) don't contain the technology. A strong cue from Google Photos Google Photos has a number of perks that Apple's Photos app lacks. Our favorites? Unlimited cloud storage for photos under 16 MP, smart content detection so you can search by keyword whether you've entered descriptors for your photos or not and built-in ways to create easily exportable animations. We think it's unlikely that Apple will cut its users a break on cloud storage, but it would be convenient if iOS rolled out with enhanced keyword organization options in Photos. iOS 10 introduced some searchability (you can search Photos for auto-generated categories like "dog' and "mountains") but we'd like to see a greater number of supported smart categories and the ability to manually enter a searchable description. At this point, many users have had iOS devices for several years and that means thousands of photos accumulated over time. We'd also like to see a way to easily export Live Photos as GIFs or video. There are third-party apps that do this, but there should be a native way to share Live Photos with non-iOS users. Even better, we would also appreciate built-in ways to create animations and collages directly from the camera roll. Group FaceTime Apart from adding the ability to make voice calls, Apple hasn't changed much about FaceTime since it first appeared with the iPhone 4. FaceTime allows one-on-one video calling between users, but group calling support would make it more enticing. Not only would this allow more scattered friends and family to have face-to-face conversations, it would also make FaceTime hold up better against competitors like Skype and Google Hangouts. A few unsubstantiated rumors suggest that group FaceTime is in fact arriving on iOS 11, but we'll have to wait and see. Customizable Control Center The Control Center is the gray panel that appears when you swipe upwards from the bottom of the display on your iPhone or iPad. It contains shortcuts to common tools like the flashlight and camera; iOS 10 expanded it so that if you swipe right, there's a second page with music controls. It's a convenient feature, but there's no way to personalize the Control Center to better serve your specific needs. For example, if you don't have an Apple TV, there's no need for the permanent AirPlay mirroring button. It would be great if users could choose a different tool or shortcut to take up that real estate. Given Apple's historical preference for prescription over customization, though, we wouldn't hold our breath for this one. Customizable default apps Count this as another pipe dream, but we wish Apple would allow iOS users to choose default apps for web browsing, music playing, e-mail, etc. that are different from Apple's preinstalled stock apps. There are slight workarounds – for example, you can delete the Mail app and install Gmail in its place – but this option isn't available for all of the iPhone's core apps, and these methods don't always play nice with other apps and system preferences. Apple typically launches major iOS updates alongside its annual smartphone flagships, so iOS 11 should officially launch with the next-generation iPhone 8 expected later this year. It's logical to wonder if OS updates will mirror the dramatic makeover rumored to be part of the 10th-anniversary iPhone, but we will know more after the WWDC. For more background, read up on the types of changes introduced by iOS 10.

Editorial Director at Mobile Nations, analyst at iMore, video and podcast host, you can follow him @reneritchie on Snapchat, Instagram, and Twitter. What does Apple have planned for its fall 2017 Watch band collection? Let's prognosticate! Since Apple Watch launched in 2015, the device has only been updated once but the bands have been updated three times — every spring and every fall to date. In addition to the original sport, leathers, and metal bands, woven nylon, Nike, and Hermès have been added to the mix, as have a plethora of new colors. So, as fall 2017 approaches, what will we see from Apple Watch bands next? New colors One thing that's been regular — like clock-work! — is new Apple Watch band colors. A year or so does not a pattern make, but the safest bet in bands these days is that there'll be new shades of sport band and classic leather, likely matching new silicon and leather iPhone cases. Woven nylon could get new colors and new patterns. Wide stripe was the rage last pring, but diamonds, triangles, zig-zags, or anything at all could be next. New link bracelets Although Apple gave them to some celebrities, the company never released gold or rose gold link bracelet editions. The same holds true for the new ceramic edition. Other watch vendors that offer ceramic cases offer ceramic bracelets to go with them. No doubt, an Apple ceramic link bracelet would be expensive, but it would also glorious. Anodized gold and rose gold, to match the sport cases, may not be resilient enough for Apple, but I have a suspicion many people would love to see them anyway. Nike+ red and more Apple Watch Nike+ was announced last fall, but only in a few colors and only with the casing. Come spring, Nike+ went solo, but still only in platinum, anthracite, and volt (green). It looks great. But it would look even greater in more colors. White and red or orange would be hot. So would black with pink or yellow. All bands in all sizes Since launch, the Leather Loop has only been available for the 42mm casing and the modern buckle, the 38mm. Sadly, wrists and tastes come in all shapes and sizes, and some would love smaller loops and bigger buckles. Making all bands available to all people is simply the right thing to do. Hopefully, Apple does it! Deploy! Deploy! Deploy! The deployant (deployment in English, and if you really want to annoy the watcherati) gives you the look of a leather buckle but the convenience of a clasp. Apple currently offers one, but only in partnership with Hermès. An Apple single deployment proper would be great for the ceramic Watch specifically. Many other watch makers currently offer deployment, sometimes by default, because the loop is safer — less chance the ceramics will fall and hit hard tiles or floorboards. Versions for the other Apple Watch finishes would be great in general as well. Lotsa leather options Rally straps are leather buckles or deployments that have three or more distinctive holes punched on either side. Based on old-time racing gloves, think of them like the Nike+ bands — stylish yet breathable. Aviators are another leather option. They feature extra-long bands that, traditionally, fit over pilot jackets, and rivets that give them a distinctly detailed look. Much more metal Sure, Apple has the Milanese, but what about the shark mesh? And the link bracelet is great, but what about an oyster or engineer? There's more than one way to make a metal mesh or segments steel, and two years after launch it would be interesting to see Apple's clever takes on yet more classics. Whether there's a market for the higher end bands, I'm not sure. But perhaps they could serve as part of yet more partner plays? Speaking of partner plays... It would be great to see more team-ups like Hermès and Nike+, and even more separate endeavors like Coach. What would be even greater would be some sort of mechanism that allowed you to unlock special watch faces when you buy the bands, even separately. For example, pick up a Hermès or Nike+ strap, enter the code that comes with it, and get the Hermès or Nike+ watch face. Or, as my colleague, Lory Gil put it — like Amiigo for Apple Watch! What Apple Watch looks are you looking forward to this fall? Just because Apple gave us new looks this spring doesn't mean we're guaranteed new looks this fall, but it's one of the easiest ways for Apple to breathe new life into the watch lineup on an ongoing basis. You can change up the look with just a couple quick presses and slides and go from fun to fancy or sport to social. So, a few new colors would be great. A few new styles, terrific.

The current leather and fabric straps have silver buckles, and the leather ones have silver lugs too, but my watch is a gunmetal colour so they look rubbish when paired with it. Maybe it's bit much to expect gunmetal trim on the straps but black at least would be an improvement.

I purchased one of the 3rd party loops on Amazon and you actually can't tell the difference between it and the OEM. The difference being real leather vs. some sort of leather/poly mix and $120 in price. The Apple Loop is way too expensive. My 3rd party version is holding up very well after constant use for 5 weeks. Actually, I don't think you can get the Apple version if you wanted...they have been out of stock since Christmas. Wondering if they are discontinued or just hard to produce. Either way, they need to produce one in the $75 - $90 range. 0 2 months ago Reply cranston37 More fashion brand partnerships.

It's holding up great, fits perfectly, etc. The Apple bands are fantastic, but the cost is hard to justify for fashion sake. There are some really bad band makers, but at the prices they're charging it's almost hard to get upset if the thing falls apart in 6 months to a year. 0 2 months ago Reply DaPhoneking Definitely the modern buckle in 42mm.

She's been talking, writing about, and tinkering with Apple products since she was old enough to double-click. In her spare time, she sketches, sings, and in her secret superhero life, plays roller derby. Follow her on Twitter @settern. The Beats Solo3 are super stylish, but lack of noise cancellation ultimately dooms them in my quest for perfect wireless headphones. "Ooo, shiny." After two months with Beats's Solo3 headphones, this is still my first reaction when pulling the company's on-ear wireless headset from my bag. The headphones I bought for this review are bright, almost fluorescent violet, with white highlights; they catch both light and eyes almost everywhere they go. For good reason, too: The Solo headphones made the Beats brand famous, and while they haven't quite reached the iconic heights of Apple's white earbuds, they're still instantly recognizable. Apple's W1-chip upgrade has brought easy wireless connectivity and new colors to the Solo line, but is it enough to warrant upgrading from an older on-ear option? Read on. Beats Solo3 Wireless - See at Apple The music is the message Beats's reputation and style carries these headphones: While I'm no audiophile, I can appreciate the overall sound of these cans, though they do have the heavier bass tones distinctive of the Beats line. It's an easy tweak in Apple's EQ settings for those who are not all about that bass, but something to be aware of.  Otherwise, the headphones have been largely unremarkable for everyday listening and video conferencing: I've listened to my usual array of work music, chatted on Google Hangouts, and even played the occasional podcast or two. I like my headphones to just give me my tunes and tracks without too much interference, and on that front, the Beats Solo work like a charm. Battery life for days (literally) The Solo3, like its fellow W1-chip headphones, provides an incredibly easy connecting experience to all iPhones, iPads, and Macs — once you pair, you're good to go on any device you have connected to your iCloud account. Having used my AirPods and Beats X pretty much everywhere, it feels utterly natural on the Solo3. Many third-party headphone manufacturers have apps these days that will let you quickly switch between devices, but even the best don't come close to the seamless switching experience of the W1-chipped headphones. The battery life on these things is ridiculous — even moreso than Bose's QC35s. Apple estimates a whopping 40 hours; in real time, I used these at a café for an entire week without dropping into the 20% range. I do wish that, like the Bose, the Beats Solo gave you a voice estimate of your percentage when you first turned them on, but it's easy enough to check on your iPhone or iPad. I will note one downside: When you finally do need to charge, the Beats Solo still uses micro-USB charging rather than the Lightning-equipped charging options found in the Beats X and AirPods. It's not a huge nitpick, but it does mean one more cord to bring along when traveling. Fit and finish I've spoken at length above about the "shiny" factor of the Beats Solo headphones, but I'll add just a little bit more here: It's the fashion-conscious who will fall head over heels for this model. I'm not even that much of a style geek, but the Product RED and violet models of the Solo had me wishing my Bose headphones had just a bit more flair to their utilitarian design. Apple's color process is, quite simply, fabulous. I had a chance recently to see Product RED headphones with the Product RED iPhone 7, and the two devices look absolutely stunning together. I also appreciate how solid these headphones feel both on your head and in your bag — Despite having plastic components, the Solo3 doesn't feel plastic, and it hides it well. The ear cups and headrest are both quite well-padded, with the cups fitting almost entirely around my ears; save for some light pressure after multiple hours of use, they don't feel like on-ear headphones at all. My only regret is that Apple didn't also anodize the metal rails that provide ear-cup extension for larger heads: They remain silver. It's not a bad look, and was probably done to prevent any sort of color flaking on slide. That said, pulling the headrest up only to see more bright violet would be a dynamite look, no? Wishing for noise-cancellation Here's where the Beats Solo3 really fall flat for me: I've gotten spoiled by noise cancellation on pretty much every wireless on-ear and over-ear option I've used; without it, I have to crank up my music (or deal with the sounds of my fellow Starbucks patrons). The Solo3 claims noise isolation, but it's not nearly as effective as its in-ear Beats X sibling: Listening to a conference call or a podcast is a complete no-go in a noisy environment — these headphones have great mids for vocal tones, but there's just too much miscellaneous background noise to focus. For some, this may not be an issue. Heck, I dealt with headphones lacking active noise cancellation for years without issue. But I use them so often now that any option lacking noise isolation or active cancellation stands out as "less" than the competition: Even if the sound is superior, the fact that I can hear a blender or dog barking during a video editing session keeps me too distracted to notice. Bottom line I wish I liked the Solo3 headphones more: They really are quite beautiful, and fit over my ears much more like an over-ear model. The sound quality is excellent, though a bit bass-heavy, and spoken content is just as good. But at $299, the Solo3 is bumping up against the price points of much more comprehensive headphones — and without noise-cancellation and touch controls, it's hard to justify buying the Solo3 when options like the Bose QC35 and Sennheiser PXC 550 are only $50 and $100 more, respectively, and cheaper on-ear options (with noise cancellation) are available in headphones like the Libratone Q Adapt.

Every other thing kinda sucked. And, the boost in bass is just unnatural. 0 14 hours ago Reply CrzyP I may have missed it, but I think it's important to highlight that the range on these things are amazing! I have a 2800 ft single floor home and I can enjoy uninterrupted sound in every room and everywhere along the exterior of my home no matter where my phone is located. It's extremely impressive and was a big selling point for me. I can't praise this performance enough. Also for those that want these but in a low-key config, there's a matte black option available. It's mature looking and not flashy. The metal bits are anodized on that model too for that all blacked out look. People can now pick these up for under $200 (except at the Apple Sore). 40+ hour battery life, long range, and good sound make these a great buy at $200 or less. They also fold up nice and compact for travel with the included case. If you're not a fan of active noise cancellation, like me, I'd pick these up stat! Just not at $300. 0 14 hours ago Reply GGIBS It is fair to say that noise cancellation, if important for you, is a great feature to have. If I were to travel often, it would be a must. That being said I did choose these in Matte Black over the QC 35 headphones. At the time they were on sale for $249.00 and honestly I didn't think that the noise cancellation feature was worth the extra hundred dollars in my particular case. I do listen to lots of EDM and R&B Music for which these headphones are well suited and the Bose didn't quite measure up in my opinion. They sounded good, but a little flat in comparison. The battery life in these is insane and I will admit at $300 they are a bit pricey. I used to wear them lots but since I picked up the Airpods, it is just more convenient to grab them and go and these mostly stay at home for right now. Still great headphones and I would make the same choice today as I did then. 0 14 hours ago Reply CrzyP I just noticed you said they're missing touch controls. What do you mean by that? On the left ear portion of the headphones, you can play/pause/skip tracks by pressing the Beats "b" just like the inline remote on EarPods. You can adjust volume by pressing above the "b" or below it. Seems like this review was lazily done. No mention of Bluetooth range, included accessories, and portability. And it appears you didn't even know there was touch controls. Talk about attention to detail. 0 13 hours ago Reply foulou I tried these for three weeks but ultimately decided they were not right for me. My main complaint was comfort and these cans were not a good fit for my slightly small ears. After I returned them, I bought the Beats X which have turned out to be great for my everyday use. 0 13 hours ago Reply returnmyjedi I had a play with these the other day. They are beautifully crafted and look less naff than other cans from Beats, but for close to $300 they are eclipsed in noise quality by others at half the price, and the premium isn't worth it for the seconds taken fiddling in bluetooth settings that the W1 chip saves. The epitome of style of substance. 0 12 hours ago Reply VAVA Mk2 Beats suck 0 7 hours ago Reply richard451 Beats Studio Wireless has the noise cancellation you are looking for. 0 7 hours ago Reply A Danz Yeah - but not the W1 chip... 0 4 hours ago Reply spittt I tried the Air Pods for jogging, Sweat made them slide out at 3/4 mile. The Powerbeats wireless would stay on my left ear OK but my right ear seems shaped funny so it slid out at 2 miles. I now wear the Solo 3 for my runs and it stays on for the full 3 miles that I typically do as well as for sprints. For me, noise cancellation would not be a good option as I may not hear the traffic too well. (I try and stay off roads as much as possible but still have to use them a bit from time to time). My wife is a yoga enthusiast and she likes the Powerbeats wireless the best. They stay on no matter what pose she does, even head stands. The Air Pods might be good for casual listening like on an airplane or car but definitely not meant for sports. I might have to sell these on kijiji as they've been in my duffle bag essentially unused for the two months I've had them. 0 1 hour ago Reply Menu Log in or Sign up Search Apple Apps & Games Accessories & Toys Photo & Video Health & Fitness Movies & Music Transport Security Rumors Analysis How To The Best Reviews Deals Forums Podcasts Android Central WindowsCentral iMore CrackBerry Connectedly TeslaCentral VRHeads MrMobile Modern Dad About Contact Us Jobs Privacy & Terms Mobile Nations 500M Consumers Reached Yearly Copyright 2017 Mobile Nations Terms and Conditions Privacy Policy Careers: Writer | Dev Licensing External Links Disclosure Advertising Partner

Airfoil Satellite TV: Everything you need to know! By Joseph Keller Wednesday, Apr 26, 2017 at 2:53 pm EDT 0 Comments Everything you need to know about streaming audio from your Mac or PC to your Apple TV using Rogue Amoeba's latest app, Airfoil Satellite TV. With the recent tvOS 10.2 update for Apple TV, users of Rogue Amoeba's Airfoil app for Mac and PC have found themselves unable to stream audio to the fourth-generation Apple TV. While this has, naturally, led to a great deal of frustration on the part of the users, Rogue Amoeba has been working on a couple of solutions, the first of which has now debuted in the form of Airfoil Satellite TV. Airfoil Satellite TV lets you stream audio from your favorite Mac and PC apps, including programs like Spotify and VLC, to your TV. Here's everything you need to know about Airfoil Satellite TV for Apple TV. Back up a sec. What is Airfoil? Airfoil is an app for Mac and PC, which lets you connect to AirPlay devices, Bluetooth speakers, Chromecasts, and more and send audio from your computers to those devices. This lets you play audio from most apps on your Mac or PC through any connected audio receiver. You can even play through multiple receivers at once. You can find out more and get Airfoil for macOS or Windows from Rogue Amoeba right here. So what is Airfoil Satellite TV? Airfoil Satellite TV connects to Airfoil on your Mac or PC, letting you send audio from various apps on those machines to your Apple TV. As long as the app is open on your Apple TV, you can stream all of the music, podcasts and other audio that you want. Airfoil Satellite TV is actually just one in a series of Airfoil Satellite apps. Available for iOS, macOS, and Windows, along with the Airfoil Speakers apps for Android and Linux, these apps turn those respective devices into audio receivers for another machine's Airfoil audio. Why can't I just use AirPlay? Changes that Apple made in tvOS 10.2 broke Airfoil's ability to stream audio to the fourth-generation Apple TV. Rogue Amoeba is working on a fix to allow Airfoil to transmit as it used to, but in the meantime, this is what the company is able to provide. So how do I use it? Once you've downloaded Airfoil Satellite TV, open the app on your Apple TV. Open the Airfoil app on your Mac or PC, then click the music note icon next to the speaker with the name "Airfoil Satellite on [your Apple TV's Name]". That's all there is to it. How much does it cost? Airfoil Satellite TV is completely free to download. However, you'll also need Airfoil for Mac or PC, which, while also free to download in a trial mode, degrades the audio you stream after 10 minutes unless you buy the full version for $29. Is there anything else I need to know? I said it earlier, but it warrants repeating: You need to keep Airfoil Satellite TV up and running on your Apple TV in order to continue streaming. Closing it will mean losing the audio connection with your Mac or PC. Okay, when can I get Airfoil Satellite TV? You can grab it now from the Apple TV App Store when you search "Airfoil Satellite TV". You can also find it on iTunes on your Mac at the link below.

Join in in our forums and let your voice be heard! The Apple Watch turned 2 this week (YAYYY HAPPY BIRTHDAY!), and ever since its launch, this mighty little accessory has taken the world by storm, with fans from Winnipeg to Bondi Beach still thrilled by everything the Apple Watch and Apple Watch Series 2 have to offer. While the Apple Watch is still a remarkable accessory that's changing and upgrading with every passing year, one question keeps getting asked over and over again: circle or square? James Falconer 04-18-2017 11:01 AM “ We've been hearing for some time that users (well some, anyway) have wanted a ROUND display on their Apple Watch. Do you think a) that'll ever happen? and b) if a round variant was available, would you buy it? Reply If you had the choice, would you pick a round display over a rectangle display for your Apple Watch? Why or why not? eyecrispy 04-18-2017 01:50 PM “ I would definitely consider a round watch. Aren't watches historically round? Reply Tartarus 04-19-2017 11:07 AM “ I love the current shape of the Watch but I am not anti-round shape. If the new watch warrants an upgrade, I'd buy it without hesitation about the shape.

Reader comments Join the discussion: Round vs. rectangle Apple Watch display 13 Comments View All Comments Log In to Comment Register Sort by Date Sort by Rating MediumPace I bought the original Apple Watch the day it came out and immediately upgraded to the Series 2 last year so I've been wearing it for most of the past two years. I say "most" because I have always wanted it to be round. Apple makes beautiful things, so the Watch is beautiful, but as a life long watch-wearer, it does not resemble a watch; and that bothers me. Other than the splendid craftsmanship that Apple is known for, I've always felt more like I had on a "calculator watch" (yes, those were a thing when I was a kid) than a "watch". After the initial "buzz" wore off, and it took the better part of 2 years for me, the Watch was being used for notifications only and so I have recently elected to buy the Samsung Gear S3 Frontier and I really like it. It handles all my notification needs just perfectly, but beyond that, I feel like I have an actual watch on my wrist...and for me, that matters. I wonder if others feel at all like me? 0 9 hours ago Reply xToddrick Does your smartphone resemble your flip phone? 0 7 hours ago Reply xToddrick How well does your Gear display a remote viewfinder, images, or video clips? How well would Apple's modular display work on your it? 0 7 hours ago Reply Ruurd Pels A round watchface on an Apple Watch would be a serious misfeature. Anyone claiming that watches are round denies that for a long time watches have also been built into square cases. Or other geometries for that matter. Yes it is called 'watch' but is it really that? It functions as one in the non-interactive use-case of just looking at it. But even then complications come into play. Form follows function and in this case function involves textual and graphical representations. Those are by default tied to a square form factor. Making the Apple Watch round will necessitate a much larger watch case. Which in turn is a much more difficult fashion item to begin with. 0 9 hours ago Reply DannyJJK Exactly, +1 0 7 hours ago Reply fritzdoss I like my Apple Watch just the way it is. I have enough round watches I wear that make the boxy Apple a refreshing change. 0 8 hours ago Reply xToddrick Apple got it right. End of discussion. 0 7 hours ago Reply tbsteph I'm perfectly happy with the current design. However, I can understand some preferring a round watch. I do not see this as an either or issue. How about Apple offering both designs. Win - win. 0 6 hours ago Reply squilts The watch I used to wear before buying the Apple Watch (day 1 -- upgraded now to version 2) was round, and I thought I'd be unhappy with this shape, but I'm not. In fact, I find I now prefer it to a round shape. I find it looks more modern than round does, but that's just my own opinion. 0 5 hours ago Reply cuttheredwire I want a watch that can change shape. Think T-2000 not Transformers. Same for my iPad: I want a software keyboard with tactile keys. I know, I know: not happening any time soon, but that is the ideal. 0 4 hours ago Reply The Jimmy James I don't get it. Is it just because people don't "get" the whole idea that it isn't just a watch? Is "omg it's a watch but not round omg" really that big a deal? If it's round, then okay, the watch face "fits" better, but then everything else sucks. That is, all the things you actually DO on it? Looking at the time is something you're going to do what? 1% of the time you use it? You glance at it then look away. If your eyes are on the watch face for more time than it takes to read it, then you're using one of the complications which guess what? PROBABLY WON'T FIT. Or you can really enjoy reading messages with so much wasted space, or... Okay, look. Just stop asking for this. They did it on the Android watches and it looks stupid. They're the size of an Invicta Russian Diver. That is, roughly the size of the Saturnian moon Enceladus. 0 3 hours ago Reply returnmyjedi Whilst I prefer the rectangle screen on the Apple Watch, the rotating bezels of the Gear S3 et al is a far better input method than the fiddly twiddly dial. 0 1 hour ago Reply JML5150 It's fine the way it is. 0 41 min ago Reply Menu Log in or Sign up Search Apple Apps & Games Accessories & Toys Photo & Video Health & Fitness Movies & Music Transport Security Rumors Analysis How To The Best Reviews Deals Forums Podcasts Android Central WindowsCentral iMore CrackBerry Connectedly TeslaCentral VRHeads MrMobile Modern Dad About Contact Us Jobs Privacy & Terms Mobile Nations 500M Consumers Reached Yearly Copyright 2017 Mobile Nations Terms and Conditions Privacy Policy Careers: Writer | Dev Licensing External Links Disclosure Advertising Partner

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Inside This Shocking Apple Inc. iPhone 8 Leak Apple's next processor could be amazing. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Apr 26, 2017 at 6:00PM On social media, user KK Sneak Leaks posted a purported screenshot of Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) upcoming iPhone 8 running the popular Geekbench 4 processor performance test. The screenshot shows that the phone achieves a single-core score of 4,537 and a multi-core score of 8,975. These scores, if they're legitimate, represent approximately 30.6% and 56.8% increases, respectively, over the A10 chip found inside of the iPhone 7. Image source: Apple. Geekbench 4 identifies the chip as running at 2.74GHz, up from 2.35GHz from the A10, and it says that the L1 instruction cache memory per core has grown from 64KB to 128KB. Perhaps the most interesting thing, though, is that Geekbench 4 says it sees one processor with four cores. I don't believe that Apple laid down four physical high-performance cores (I expect a continuation of two high performance/two high efficiency core structure as seen in the A10), so my suspicion is that Apple has added a technique called simultaneous multithreading to the CPU cores (this allows the system to see each core as two, leading to improved core resource utilization). Indeed, you'll note that the multi-core performance uplift that Apple seemingly gets generation-over-generation with the A11 in multi-core performance is greater than the uplift that it gets in single-core. If Apple has implemented SMT, then it would manifest itself in increased multi-core performance with minimal impact on single-core performance. If this leak is legitimate, then what Apple has built with the A11 is extremely impressive. Delivering on the pocket PC promise If the leak from KK Sneak Leaks is legitimate, then Apple will not only have far-and-away the highest-performing smartphone processor core (the processor core inside of the Apple A9 is faster than anything fielded by the Android camp, though), but the company will be able to truthfully claim that the next-generation iPhone offers personal computer class CPU performance. To illustrate this, the 13-inch MacBook Pro with an Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) Core i7-6567U scored 4,281 in single-core and 8,242 in multi-core in 9to5Mac's testing. If the A11 leak is legitimate -- and I suspect that it is -- then the A11 should offer better CPU performance than the chip inside of the current top-end 13-inch MacBook Pro. Intel has better processors out than the 6567U (Apple just hasn't used them yet), and Intel will probably put out faster notebook processors by the time consumers can buy A11-powered devices, but the point is clear: Apple could very well offer PC-class performance in its next-generation iPhone. The possibilities that this will open for app developers seem exciting, especially as this level of performance waterfalls down to lower-cost devices over the next couple years. Next step: GPU dominance? Based on Apple's seemingly incredible execution in CPU performance, I look forward to seeing what the company will deliver with its first fully custom graphics processor and beyond. Apple's Imagination (NASDAQOTH:IGNMF)-based graphics processors are already quite good, but Apple's track record suggests it will be able to really pull out in front with its own fully custom designs. It will be interesting to see if developers will be able to leverage Apple's chip superiority to build apps with features and capabilities that aren't possible on Android devices, which have a much wider range of processor capabilities, and that range has a much lower floor than Apple's.

Turns out it's going to be easier to use. Securities and forensics expert Jonathan Zdziarski is joining Apple's Security Engineering and Architecture team. That's great news for Apple, but what about his epic Mac protection tool, Little Flocker, which was quickly snatched up by F-Secure? F-Secure announced that it would rebrand the tool XFENCE and would launch it as a free beta program for the masses. In an interview, Sean Sullivan, F-Secure security advisor, told MacWorld that users who previously purchased Little Flocker will be able to receive free additional tools that will be locked behind a pay wall for everyone else. Sullivan told MacWorld that F-Secure's plan is to make Little Flocker (now XFENCE) "more accessible to a greater number of users." In its current form, Little Flocker requires an intimate knowledge of a Mac's operating system and is a little too complicated for the average user. MacWorld notes that XFENCE could allow users without administrative accounts the ability to use some security tools, and allow someone to customize the level of interaction needed for some notification tools. The intent with the Xfence release is to make it part of a multi-pronged method of helping users by making smarter deductions about what normal activity is. For instance, a network firewall might take note, Sullivan said, that "we've never seen you connect to Bulgaria before. "Do we want to let you make that connection?" Instead of alerting about anything, outlying behavior prompts notification, removing some of the warning fatigue that otherwise kicks in. Little Flocker, you may recall, is a tool that watches app activity on your Mac and alerts you when any changes are made in order to protect you from malware, ransomware, and backdoors and prevents malicious programs from accessing files and system resources without your explicit permission. XFENCE will follow the same path, but will be, well, dumbed down, so the average user can make sense of it. Advanced tools that are beloved by Little Flocker fans will likely be available for an additional cost in the future (though still free for Little Flocker investors). You can sign up to join the beta of XFENCE at F-Secure's website today.

Find out what he learned. Emma Sarran WebsterApr 26, 2017 5:18PM EDT Facebook Twitter Pinterest Facebook Twitter Pinterest facebook dialog PinterestQilai Shen/Bloomberg via Getty Images Last summer, New York University graduate student Dejian Zeng spent six weeks working for Apple. But it wasn’t a glamorous internship at the company’s Silicon Valley headquarters. Nope, Zeng traveled all the way to China, where he spent six 60-hour-a-week work weeks fastening screws to iPhone casings for 3,100 yuan a month (about $450). Mashable reports that Zeng, a masters of public administration student at NYU Wagner, took the job in an undercover capacity, as part of an investigation with NYU and the organization China Labor Watch to really see what labor conditions are like in the factories that make our beloved Apple devices. He worked for the Taiwanese electronics manufacturing company, Pegatron, at one of their factories outside of Shanghai, China. Pegatron is one of Apple’s main manufacturing partners. To get the job, Zeng had to simply wait his turn in a line at the factory, show his IDs and his hands, and recite the English alphabet. From there, he was assigned to “Station 26: Fasten Speaker to Housing,” he told Mashable in an interview. “What I do is that I put one screw over the speaker and fasten it on the back case of iPhone, and that’s the only work that I do,” he said. “It’s just one screw for about 12 hours in the factory.” As part of a 200-person assembly line that produced 3,600 iPhones a day, Zeng estimated he fastened 1,800 screws each day. And they weren’t short days, either. All said, Zeng spent 12 hours a day at the factory — with no music or phone of his own — working 10.5 hours with a 10-minute break in the morning, a 15-minute break for lunch, and a 30-minute break for dinner. He worked six days a week, only breaking on Sundays. When he left work, he was so tired that he didn’t want to do much aside from go to bed (in his eight-person-per room dorm that had about 200 people per floor sharing only one bathroom). And those hours weren’t negotiable — Zeng says he told his manager he didn’t want to do overtime, but was told that wasn’t an option. And that wasn’t the only managerial issue. Zeng said that “yelling is a routine in the factory,” and that his manager once stopped his entire assembly line and gathered all 200 people together just to yell at one worker because, Zeng guessed, the employee wasn’t producing quickly enough. To its credit, Zeng said the factory facility is “actually very good.” He told Mashable, “it’s not the traditional sweat shop that we would think about. It’s pretty clean, it’s pretty bright, and they have AC and other stuff.” But, he also noted that while conditions aren’t bad, there’s lots of room for improvement; and right now there’s no good way for the factory workers to communicate their grievances. “When workers feel their rights have been violated they can file a complaint. But that complaint is handled by the factories themselves," Zeng said. "They never go through Apple. So if they don’t think that this complaint should be submitted they will block it. And that’s what happened to me.” Mashable noted that, at another iPhone factory, Foxconn, workers can report issues directly to Apple. Now that he’s back in the States, Zeng wants to advocate for his former coworkers and their working conditions. In the meantime, there are questions surrounding whether or not Apple manufacturing will relocate to the U.S., after Donald Trump [told] the New York Times that he would “get Apple to build a big plant in the United States,” instead of continuing to produce products overseas. Both Foxconn and Pegatron have reportedly investigated the possibility of opening factories stateside, but there are concerns about cost, and whether or not Apple (and its customers) would be willing to pay more to make it happen. Regardless, Zeng hopes to bring greater awareness to the factories tasked with making our devices and, more importantly, the people working in them. “We need to be aware that behind these products there are millions of workers producing it,” he said. “And then it would be great if we can talk more about it and probably make some changes in the factories so that they will have good conditions while they’re producing this great service and great product for us, and we are enjoying these amazing electronic devices.” Related: Donald Trump's Ties Are Produced in Chinese Factories Under Horrific Conditions, According to a New Report follow us Facebook Twitter Pinterest Recommended for You Follow:FacebookTwitterInstagramPinterestWe Heart ItTumblrYouTubeGoogle Plustoggle social menu Condé Nast Condé Nast Websites Allure Ars Technica Backchannel Bon Appétit Brides Condé Nast Traveler Epicurious Glamour Golf Digest Golf World GQ GQ Style Pitchfork Self Style Teen Vogue The New Yorker The Scene Vanity Fair Vogue W Wired Site MapContact usNewsletter SignupSubscriptionsIn this issue CareersCondé Nast StoreReprints/PermissionsParsons x TeenVogue Accessibility Help Registration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy (Revised 1/2/2014).  Teen Vogue may earn a portion of sales from products that are purchased through our site as part of our Affiliate Partnerships with retailers.  Your California Privacy Rights.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars AI Guest AI startups are ready to take on Fortune 500 Alston Ghafourifar, Entefy@entefy April 26, 2017 2:10 PM Above: AI needs more data. Image Credit: Shutterstock.com / Mmaxer People love a good David and Goliath story. Thanks to artificial intelligence, we may once again see many iterations of this narrative play out in the business space. For a long time now, big corporations have held most of the cards. Their capital, brand recognition, large staffs, and access to data have dwarfed the resources and capabilities of small businesses. So much so that in 2015, the Global Fortune 500 represented $27.6 trillion in revenues and employed 67 million people. This is a stunning concentration of power in a relatively small number of corporations. But AI is changing competitive dynamics and leveling the playing field in several ways. AI systems are becoming more advanced even as the cost to develop or access these systems is declining. We’re approaching a time when AI technologies will facilitate smarter, faster business processes at lower costs, allowing for some serious disruptions of existing markets by newcomers. It’s becoming possible to imagine a five-person startup going head to head with a Fortune 500 behemoth. Here’s how it might work. Is history about to repeat itself? One of the most dramatic David and Goliath business stories of our time is that of Microsoft outmaneuvering IBM in the 1980s. At its peak market capitalization in 1985, IBM was larger than Apple is today, accounting for 6.4 percent of the market value of the S&P 500 (compared to Apple, which is around 4 percent today). With scale, personnel, capital, and clout, IBM seemed untouchable. IBM was a pioneer in computing, but it was blinded by its own success. The company focused on mainframes and developed big, clunky computers as it always had. It invested heavily in large-scale enterprise computing even as advances in technology allowed for the advent of the personal computer market. That’s when Microsoft seized its chance. The story of Microsoft’s development and release of MS-DOS while working on an operating system for IBM is the stuff of Silicon Valley legend. Microsoft knew that personal computing was a market with huge potential. As a smaller, more agile company, it was better positioned than IBM to capitalize on it. By focusing on graphical user interfaces (GUIs) that could be used in personal computing, Microsoft catered to an entirely new market for home computers and found a way to outcompete its industry-dominating client. Today’s big tech corporations should heed IBM’s disruption as AI becomes an increasingly significant component of their business operations. Many of the largest brands in the world are using AI to address their internal needs, building improved advertising systems, bolstering product recommendation algorithms, and collecting data for business intelligence (BI) systems. AI’s primary purpose in those cases is to serve the companies’ needs, though, not cater to their customers. Focusing on internal needs and legacy systems — IBM’s strategic mistake — leaves the door open to the same technologies being applied to new products and customer experiences by disruptive competitors. Small businesses don’t need to spend heavily on operational improvements. They can direct their AI investments into consumer-facing products, targeting market segments that are overlooked or underserved by major corporations. Take one San-Francisco-based startup using AI to disrupt the lingerie industry. Knowing that most women find bra shopping a grueling experience, the company created an app that enables women to find the perfect fit from the comfort of their own homes. The app uses AI to analyze photos submitted by the women to determine their sizes, a much more comfortable experience than being sized in-store while other customers may be milling around nearby. The application of AI to a novel business offering neutralizes the advantages of large networks of stores and existing brands. In another example of disruption through AI, travel companies have begun using behavioral data and predictive analytics to customize brand experiences based on individuals’ preferences and patterns. Using this technology allows them to compete with major travel brands through unique, personalized offerings. That’s a powerful differentiator, considering that consumers crave personalization but delivering it can be a challenge. No personnel, no problem One traditional advantage of entrenched enterprises is large teams of highly specialized workers. These companies can attract top-tier talent and have the resources to hire employees for whatever critical tasks arise. Small businesses, meanwhile, get by with team members who are often jacks-of-all-trades by necessity. But AI is neutralizing the large staff advantage, laying bare its associated limitations, like more bureaucracy and slower execution times. A smaller organization doesn’t suffer from those limitations because its teams can be flat and agile. Now add AI to the mix. AI-based services are capable of handling administrative tasks such as scheduling, invoicing, data entry, and even legal work. Right out of the gate, startup founders can outsource essential but low-level tasks to automated systems that operate faster and cheaper than human employees. Automating IT functions alone reduces expenses by 14 to 28 percent, so companies that launch using automated services quickly establish a financial advantage over larger, legacy-burdened competitors. For higher-level tasks, many AI software systems now include intuitive dashboards that anyone on the team can access and utilize productively. Centralized data hubs allow colleagues to draw from the same pool of information and track how their efforts affect the rest of the company. Next generation customer-relationship management (CRM) systems, for instance, could be a game-changer for small businesses. CRMs help companies track important information about their customers — what they’ve purchased in the past, when they’ve interacted with the organization’s website, what they’re saying about the brand on social media. But CRM systems are generally cost-prohibitive for new businesses. They also only work if salespeople input customer data, and that’s a tedious, time-consuming task akin to analog paperwork. That’s why some companies use AI assistants to integrate data from sales reps’ smartphones and work-related apps. Rather than spend hours inputting or scrolling through customer data, they have all the information they need at their fingertips. Without having to do low-level tasks like data entry, sales representatives can focus on building long-term customer relationships that lead to increased earnings for their companies. Real-time campaign analytics systems enable small, nimble organizations to pivot quickly based on performance. That ability is a critical competitive edge in today’s rapidly evolving consumer markets. Some tech experts believe that the current generation of applied AI systems, such as predictive analytics, will give small businesses advantages through increased automation and efficiency. Cloud services and automated marketing programs also reduce costs and personnel needs considerably. The barrier to launching and growing a company successfully has lowered significantly, and the rise of adaptive small companies is closing the gap between the little guys and the titans of industry. An example of this is in fintech, where startups are taking on major investment companies. They’re using dashboards and roboadvisers to offer smarter, more user-friendly ways for consumers to track, manage, and plan their investments. They expect AI to disrupt financial advisory services, and they’re building that anticipation into their services. Such foresight makes them uniquely suited to meet shifting consumer demands even when legacy organizations may struggle to keep up. Attacking the large company data advantage One area in which Fortune 500s may still hold an advantage is in their vast stores of customer and market data. That information can be used to make predictions and inform product development, and newer, smaller companies simply don’t have the same data pool from which to draw. However, massive amounts of open source intelligence (publicly available data) on consumers is generated every day. People’s online behaviors, social media activity, and even geolocation check-ins contribute to a growing data pool that small businesses can tap. As increasingly sophisticated data tools become available to small enterprises, they may be able to close the data gap further. Business intelligence software was once so costly and complex that only major companies could afford to buy it and hire IT personnel who could make sense of it. Today, smaller businesses are taking advantage of the growing range of lower-cost BI solutions that essentially work out of the box. There’s no need to hire a team specifically to work with the software; it’s intuitive enough that anyone can draw insights from it. New BI platforms offer data visualization, customer relationship management programs, and other critical BI services. One micro-lending company uses a modern BI program to conduct performance analyses of its beneficiaries. It can now identify under-performers in a fraction of the time it took when relying on spreadsheets. This is just one way BI is enabling businesses of all sizes to make faster, smarter decisions. Focus on customers and their needs Increasingly, tech-savvy consumers demand seamless, automated user experiences, and a new generation of innovators will rush to meet the demand. AI is enabling these companies to compete based on the quality of their products and move quickly into new markets free of any legacy technology burden — basically, to apply the early Microsoft vs. IBM formula to today’s business environment. With the increasing automation and analytical benefits of AI systems, these companies can use technology to improve report writing, job listings, data crunching, and a range of other functions. Fewer people can do more with less. As AI becomes more ubiquitous and less costly, small businesses will find further opportunities to go up against major players. The balance of power looks likely to shift from the biggest companies with the greatest resources to those that can quickly create innovative services that satisfy real consumer needs.

Under Trump's proposals, American companies would move from being the most highly taxed among the Group of 20 countries to among the lowest. Tax rates would fall below those of neighboring Mexico and Canada, which Trump has accused of shortchanging the United States in trade deals. Corporate leaders and business lobbying groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce on Wednesday cheered the administration's tax proposals, while allowing that the initial one-page plan left out crucial details. The tax plan, which includes a cut in taxes on public companies to 15 percent from 35 percent, does not detail cuts in spending that would help keep the budget deficit under control. AT&T Corp Chief Executive Randall Stephenson welcomed the tax plan but cautioned "the practical reality of getting to 15 percent is you have to get yourself reconciled to some level of deficits for a period of time as you get the economic stimulation." Big U.S. companies have nearly $1.8 trillion in cash stockpiled overseas, according to Moody's Investors Service. Technology powerhouse Apple Inc has more than $200 billion of that total. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday, but Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook has said the company was looking to bring back offshore cash if tax rates for doing so were lower. "What we would do with it, let's wait and see exactly what it is, but as I've said before we are always looking at acquisitions," Cook told investors on the company's first-quarter earnings call in January. Cook's comment points to a big unknown for the White House and congressional Republicans, who have said business tax cuts would result in more and better jobs. Studies of the results of past tax holidays found that most of the offshore cash brought home by U.S. companies was used to buy back shares or make acquisitions, not to fund investments in production capacity or jobs. Under pressure from shareholders, listed companies have set high targets for return on invested capital. General Motors Co , for example, has told investors it is aiming for 20 percent returns on its capital investments. Many U.S. companies have been tightfisted about investing in new plants and equipment following the last recession, which left them wary of becoming overextended. Since 2014, investment in new equipment has flatlined, according to government data. A MIXED BAG The financial impact of the White House tax plan will vary widely by company and business sector. A proposal to cut inheritance taxes, for example, is of high interest to auto dealers, which are often family-controlled enterprises. Many companies already pay less than the headline 35 percent tax rate. Companies in the S&P 500 index paid an average tax rate of 29.06 percent for 2016, Standard and Poors said. A change of a few percentage points in tax rates can make a big difference. Aircraft maker Boeing Co on Wednesday reported a 19 percent increase in first quarter profits, partly because of a 4 percentage-point drop in its tax rate. "At the highest level we're a big supporter of tax reform," Boeing Chief Financial Officer Greg Smith told analysts and journalists on a call Wednesday. "It's going to drive jobs, it's going to drive the U.S. economy broadly speaking and it's going to allow us to compete." Boeing has been cutting jobs in the United States, warning employees last week that it planned another round of cuts that would eliminate hundreds of engineering jobs. While the tax cuts may produce a short-term boost to the economy and add fuel to a stock market rally, it falls short of the comprehensive tax reform that Trump had pledged earlier. Regarding other parts of his agenda, his administration has been stymied in its attempts to limit immigration by the courts, while an attempt to repeal and replace Obamacare failed in Congress. "A cynic would say this is a rushed attempt to have something big to show for President Trump's first 100 days in office," said Luke Bartholomew, investment strategist at Aberdeen Asset Management in London.

Published on April 26, 2017. 0 Android and iOS run the smartphone world. Figures from Gartner reveal that 99.6% of fourth-quarter sales in 2016 were for both mobile systems. This data isn’t a surprise either as this has been the scenario for quite some time. But whether you prefer Google’s mobile platform or Apple’s, you will most likely need an email app. Apart from being one of the most popular mail providers in the planet, Gmail is also available in app form. With an app, users no longer need to access a browser just to get to their mail. Even better, they can receive notifications as new messages come in. Downloading Gmail for Android and iOS is easy. Google and Apple both have a dedicated “store” where the latest apps, music, movies and other downloadable material can be found. Google has the Play Store and Apple has the App Store. Gmail download for Android Here’s how to get Gmail onto your Android smartphone: Fire up the Play Store app Perform a search for Gmail Tap on Install Gmail download for iOS Go to the App Store Do a search for Gmail Tap on Get For a time, Gmail on Android was way better than the iOS version. All that changed in November 2016 when Google released a redesigned version of the app – the first major one in about four years. The new version featured a new look as well as some requested features. Some of the features included were Undo Send, a faster search, and swiping for archiving or deleting. With one billion active users all around the world, Gmail is clearly the preferred mail provider of choice by a lot of people. Google is also rewarding that user base by providing updates for the app and web versions.

April saw the opening of another crop of dining places and the introduction of menus by old players. PHOTOS BY ANGELO COMSTI Apple Cheese Tart by Kumori Hanjuku Cheese, Toyohashi Pudding and its Signature Cheese Tart—there is definitely a lot to like at Kumori. Its recent offering translates the all-time favorite apple pie into a cheesy creation. A sweet tart shell is topped with caramelized apples and blanketed with a combo of cheeses. The baked treat is then crowned with a streusel, adding contrast to the creamy texture. A best seller in the making, the Apple Cheese Tart is on limited run, so grab a box when you can. ADVERTISEMENT Kumori Japanese Bakery is at SM North Edsa, UP Town Center, SM Makati. Crispy Stuffed Crab Claw at Canton Road Shangri-La at the Fort’s Canton Road has a good representation of China’s regional cuisines. This month, executive chef Joris Rycken and executive Chinese chefs Wang Wei Qing and Edwin Lok came up with a 24-hour marinated salted duck; soy-glazed stir-fried prawns and red tea leaves; wok-tossed pork knuckles with spicy garlic; and braised seafood soup with crab roe and fish maw. The whole menu satisfies, but the Crispy Stuffed Crab Claw delights. It’s a crab “meatball” that’s been lodged back into the claw, breaded, golden fried and dipped in hibiscus sauce. Canton Road, 3/F Shangri-La at The Fort, 30th St. corner 5th Ave., Bonifacio Global City, Taguig. Shrimp Ravioli with Uni Butter at M Dining ADVERTISEMENT It may be hard to release M Dining from the chains of its past (Masseto), but executive chef Tom Bascon is creating a new set of dishes to love and come back for. His fresh pastas are some of the city’s best. The tagliatelle tossed in yuzu cream is light yet filling, while the shrimp ravioli is rich, with the oily slick of uni butter. The Bicol uni and shiso tempura with the stuffed pasta dish deserve to be on their own as appetizers. M Dining, 3/F Alegria Alta Bldg, 2294 Chino Roces Ave. Makati. Pine Nut Cheesecake at Wildflour Café and Bakery Recognized for its exceptional bread and pastries, Wildflour has two kinds of cheesecake—the Cheesecake Flan and the Pine Nut Cheesecake, introduced just last week. It was inspired by the popular cheesecake of La Vina Restaurant in San Sebastian, Spain. Like the well-loved Spanish cake, Wildflour’s is also burnt on top, creamy and not dense like many commercial cheesecakes. What’s unique about it, though, is that this is mixed with pine nuts that lend that nutty flavor. Wildflour Café and Bakery is at G/F Podium; G/F, Net Lima Building, BGC; Frabelle Business Centre, Makati; O Square, Greenhills, San Juan. Roasted Duck at Made Nice Supper Club Made Nice has been generating buzz since opening late last year because of its memorable New York-inspired dishes. The Octopus, its pasta dishes and desserts are prominent posts on social media. Its newest dish, the rich and gratifying duck, is bound to be a hit, too. A roasted duck breast with the fat perfectly rendered sits in a pool of fig sauce and accompanied by pieces of foie gras tortellini. Made Nice Supper Club, G/F PPI Building, 109 Esteban St., Legaspi Village, Makati. Black Sesame Oreo Ice Cream by Merry Moo Sea salt caramel, earl grey tea and strawberry basil are among Merry Moo’s hot items. This summer, artisanal ice cream maker Kelvin Ngo introduced five more variants— orange chocolate, salted caramel coconut sugar, Thai milk tea, almond lychee, and the most promising of the lot, the black sesame Oreo. It tastes like the adult’s cookies and cream. The nuttiness of the sesame is the perfect complement to the chocolate sweetness of the cream-filled cookie. Merry Moo is at SM Aura, SM Megamall and Legaspi and Salcedo weekend markets, and in select supermarkets. Yema Sansrival at Classic Confections From the baker behind the best-selling Nono’s Chocolate Oblivion comes a new cake. “I wanted to come out with a sansrival but I wanted it to be different,” says Baba Ibazeta-Benedicto, who recently opened her first restaurant, Nono’s at UP Town Center. “I thought of yema, since it’s a Filipino favorite.” Three layers of cashew nut meringue sandwich have a smooth custard-taste filling. It has buttercream icing. Classic Confections, 2/F Greenbelt 5; Nono’s, 1/F Phase 1B, UP Town Center. Raw Seafood Platters at Hook by Todd English “Our raw bar section at The Todd English Food Hall is the second most popular station after the grill (which we turned into Pound), so we decided to turn our next spin-off into a seafood restaurant focused on borderless seafood,” says Eric Dee of the Foodee Global Concepts. The oysters are flown in daily from Aklan, and only the sushi grade salmon and tuna are imported. An estimated 80 percent of the seafood is sourced locally and served using Asian, Western and European techniques. The best way to appreciate what Hook offers is to order the raw platters, so you enjoy the seafood in multiple preparations and complemented with a bevy of flavors. They include the snapper and apple clam ceviche, tuna poke, crab and uni slaw and salmon with ginger jam. Hook by Todd English, Uptown Parade, Uptown Bonifacio, Taguig. Adobo sa Dilaw Quinoa at Karen’s Kitchen Karen’s Kitchen has always been known for cakes and pastries. But when Karen Young turned the home-based brand into a neighborhood restaurant, its popularity grew to include comfort food and tasty healthy fare. Her Adobo sa Dilaw Quinoa is so new, just a few days old, and people are talking about it. Karen first came across the Batangas adobo in a resort outside the city. “I loved it but it’s too far for me to go back so I made my own version,” she says. The chicken is slow braised, in a broth enhanced with turmeric, for two hours, resulting in a juicy meat that falls off the bone. It comes with quinoa cooked in the same potent broth, served with blanched okra. Karen’s Kitchen, 17-A San Rafael St., Kapitolyo, Pasig. Signature 15-Course Grill at Ibiza Beach Club, BGC From Cebu comes the Ibiza Beach Club, a sprawling 4,000-square meter entertainment and food hub that opened in Taguig on Easter Sunday. The grand restaurant has a chic resort design, with a view of the BGC concrete jungle. It has private lounges, a Jacuzzi, and a center stage equipped with state-of-the-art sound system. Equally grand is the food, the signature 15-course Balearic-inspired grill in particular. There’s a salad bar and you can have your fill of any (or all) of the grilled items served and sliced on the table. There’s jumbo prawns, calamari, salmon, the catch of the day (fish), filet mignon, lamb leg, pork belly, ostrich, chicken and baby back ribs. What I thoroughly enjoyed were the tender lamb chops with mint jelly, US Angus rib eye, and fork-tender beef ribs. The meal-with-the-best-deal also comes with rice or mashed potatoes, and a refreshing dessert—grilled pineapple with fresh yogurt and honey. It’s reasonably priced!

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile iPhone 8 Suffering From Wireless Charging Overheat And Low PCB Yields; Separate Reports Claim Only Two iPhones Incoming This Year By Ramish Zafar 12 hours ago 11Shares Share Tweet Submit Apple’s widely rumored to launch a special iPhone this year. Dubbed the iPhone 8, the device will make a lot of upgrades to the lineup. 2017’s ushered in a new era for smartphones and the iPhone 8 will be Apple’s response to its competitors. It’s been a while since the company’s played on the front foot with the iPhone. That being said, today we’ve got more details for the smartphone. Take a look below to find out more. PCB, Wireless Charging For The iPhone 8 Run Into Problems As Apple Rumored To Skip Over iPhone 7s And iPhone 7s Plus Talking of features, the iPhone 8 will be full of them. Apple will compensate for nearly every missing feature that’s included in Android. Wireless charging, OLEDs, reduced bezels and Iris/3D recognition – all are features rumored for the iPhone 8. Alongside these rumors, we’ve also seen reports of the device seeing production constraints surface. Initially, sources claimed that the iPhone 8 will see a November release due to OLED bottlenecks. There simply aren’t enough display manufacturers in the world with the capacity to meet Apple’s requirements, is the reason behind these. Related Apple Might Not Be Able to Bring LG Display Into the OLED Fold for 2018 iPhone Lineup Because of Two Firms However, soon afterwards, industry analysts claimed that Apple’s primary display supplier, Samsung isn’t facing any problems at all with its output. Samsung’s OLED production is right on schedule and the company will make the first shipments to Apple in June. Today, we’ve got fresh reports from Apple’s supply chain. According to these, the display isn’t the only component that’s suffering from low yield. Supply chain sources claim that wireless charging modules for the iPhone 8 are overheating with suppliers still struggling to resolve these problems. Arthur Liao of Fubon securities believes that the iPhone 8‘s wireless charging modules are far from perfect right now. Advertisement As far as PCBs go, “There is a new design for a much smaller printed circuit board to allow a more powerful battery for this upcoming iPhone…but there are still some quality issues to overcome to achieve smooth mass production”, says Sean Kao, an analyst over at IDC. These delays put the release date for the iPhone 8 around late October or November. Memory modules for the smartphone are on time however, with one executive already having made deliveries to Apple at a small-scale. On another note, some fresh reports claim that Apple will launch two, not three iPhones this year. Micgadget claims to have inside sources at Foxconn who claim to have received orders for two new iPhones. These sources claim that the first materials for these two new iPhones will reach Foxconn by the end of June. This coincides with reports of Samsung making OLED deliveries to Apple by June as well. Two iPhones instead of three makes business sense for Apple as well. Why launch a highly upgraded iPhone 8 which will take the spotlight from the other two iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus variants? Still, it’s the first time that we’re hearing such a claim, so treat it with humor. Even if the publication’s sources turn out to be accurate, they don’t account for the entirety of Foxconn’s iPhone orders. Thoughts? Let us know what you think in the comments section below and stay tuned. We’ll keep you updated on the latest.

By JenniferBooton Reporter Apple Inc. is expected to report revenue at the high end of its guidance when it releases second-quarter earnings after the market closes Tuesday, fueled by the iPhone 7 Plus and continued growth in services. Apple AAPL, -0.59%   has shifted the tone of its earnings calls recently to focus on software and services in addition to its flagship hardware. While the iPhone remains Apple’s biggest top-line contributor by far, services such as Apple Care and Apple Music surpassed the Mac last year, as revenues topped $24 billion. Read Also: Apple gets permit to test driverless cars in California Last quarter, Apple CEO Tim Cook, who has referred to services as a “large and important source of recurring revenues” for the company, forecast that Apple’s services revenue would double by 2020. Credit Suisse analyst Kulbinder Garcha, who recently reiterated an outperform rating on the stock and lifted his price target to $170 from $160, said he believes services will grow to become 33% of Apple’s gross profit within a few years, with revenues increasing to $52 billion by 2020. Overall, analysts are expecting an in-line quarter. But it’s important to note that this fiscal year is being compared against a historically weak 2016, when Apple recorded its first annual revenue decline in more than a decade and suffered its first-ever decline in iPhone sales. Here’s what to expect: Earnings: Analysts expect Apple to report GAAP earnings per share of $2.02, up from $1.90 in the year-earlier period, according to FactSet. Estimize, a software platform that uses crowdsourcing from hedge-fund executives, brokerages and buy-side analysts to predict earnings, has Apple earning $2.07 a share. Apple has a long history of topping the FactSet consensus estimate, and it usually comes relatively in-line with the forecasts on Estimize, which tend to be a bit more bullish. Revenue: Sell-side analysts expect Apple to report revenue of $53 billion, according to FactSet, up from $50.5 billion in the same period last year. Contributors on Estimize are also forecasting revenue of $53 billion. In January, Apple set its guidance in the range of $51.5 billion to $53.5 billion. The company beat both the FactSet and Estimize consensus estimates last quarter but missed both in the prior quarter. Revenue from the iPhone is projected to increase by 4.3% to $34.3 billion, after gaining 5.3% in the key holiday quarter, according to FactSet. Apple is expected to have shipped 52 million phones during the quarter, up from 51 million in the year-earlier period, according to FactSet. Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty increased her price target on the stock to $161 from $154 last week, citing a higher-than-expected mix of iPhone 7 Plus sales. She raised her estimate on average selling prices to $753 from $713 currently, well above the $660 FactSet estimate. Revenue from services, which represents Apple’s fastest-growing and most profitable business segment, is expected to climb 18% to $7.1 billion this quarter, according to a FactSet survey of around 40 analysts. Stock reaction: Shares of Apple have been on a tear since the company’s last earnings report, fueled by an earnings beat, a bold outlook for its services business and demand for the iPhone 7 Plus, whose more expensive cost structure has increased average selling prices for the iPhone product category. The stock has hit and traded around all-time highs in recent weeks. Shares have gained 18% in the past three months, vastly outperforming the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.10%  , up 4.5%. They have increased by more than 38% in the past 12 months, versus a 17% improvement for the index. The S&P 500 SPX, -0.05%   has rallied 4% in the past three months and 14% in the past year. Read: Apple beef is all Qualcomm can talk about The average rating on Apple stock is the equivalent to buy, while the average price target among a poll of roughly 40 analysts surveyed by FactSet is $150.96, implying 4.5% upside to Tuesday’s closing price. What to watch for: Last quarter, Apple benefitted from holiday demand for the iPhone 7 and the massive recall of rival Samsung Electronics’ 005930, +2.43%  Galaxy Note 7, which led to a surge in customers switching from Android to iOS. This quarter, analysts will have their eye on Apple’s forecasts, with Samsung this week boasting record preorders for the Galaxy S8, its first product launch since the exploding-phone saga last fall. Mizuho analyst Abhey Lamba, who reiterated a buy rating and $150 price target on the stock this week, said he expects Apple’s outlook to come in “modestly below consensus.” The third quarter is typically the worst for iPhone sales, and the company will likely be expecting demand to taper — perhaps more than usual — ahead of the highly-anticipated iPhone 8 launch in September. See also: Apple’s Fifth Avenue cube is coming down for an expansion project The FactSet consensus is calling for third-quarter iPhone shipments of 42 million units, which would be an increase from 40 million in the year-earlier period. Revenue for the current quarter is projected to come in around $45.6 billion, versus $42.3 billion in the same quarter last year. Last week, Pacific Crest analyst Andy Hargreaves said his checks with suppliers suggest Apple is struggling with the optical fingerprint functionality on the coming OLED iPhone, which will likely be the higher-priced of the phones it unveils this year. He warned it could cause production delays. But even if prompted, don’t expect Apple to discuss future products or plans, because it never does. Stifel analyst Aaron Raker increased his price target on Apple’s stock to $150 from $130 on a hold rating last week, and said he expected iPhone shipments to reach a record 250.6 million in 2018. Another thing to watch is Apple’s capital allocation program. The second-quarter earnings report is typically the medium Apple uses to provide updates to its investor programs. RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani, who lifted his stock price target to $157 from $155 on an outperform rating last week, said he’s anticipating an increase to both the buyback program and dividends. See also: Apple’s Tim Cook once threatened to kick Uber out of the App Store There’s a chance that eased corporate tax regulations — such as reducing the corporate tax rate to 15% from 35%, which was proposed this week by President Donald Trump, as well as rules that would make it easier for companies to repatriate international profits and return cash to the U.S. — could impact its capital allocation plans. But none of those policies out of Washington have been set in stone yet. Apple, which had more than $246 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of its last quarter, authorized an increase of $50 billion to its capital return program in the second quarter of 2016. That included a plan to increase its buyback program to $175 billion from the $140 billion level it announced the prior year, and a 10% increase in its quarterly dividend to 57 cents a share. Absent major tax changes, RBC said Apple could maintain the $50 billion annual increase to its capital allocation program, which he estimates could include a 15% dividend increase. CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino said he expects Apple to increase its dividend by “at least 10%” and expand its buyback by up to $10 billion.

See also: Apple’s Fifth Avenue cube is coming down for an expansion project The FactSet consensus is calling for third-quarter iPhone shipments of 42 million units, which would be an increase from 40 million in the year-earlier period. Revenue for the current quarter is projected to come in around $45.6 billion, versus $42.3 billion in the same quarter last year. Last week, Pacific Crest analyst Andy Hargreaves said his checks with suppliers suggest Apple is struggling with the optical fingerprint functionality on the coming OLED iPhone, which will likely be the higher-priced of the phones it unveils this year. He warned it could cause production delays. But even if prompted, don’t expect Apple to discuss future products or plans, because it never does. Stifel analyst Aaron Raker increased his price target on Apple’s stock to $150 from $130 on a hold rating last week, and said he expected iPhone shipments to reach a record 250.6 million in 2018. Another thing to watch is Apple’s capital allocation program. The second-quarter earnings report is typically the medium Apple uses to provide updates to its investor programs. RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani, who lifted his stock price target to $157 from $155 on an outperform rating last week, said he’s anticipating an increase to both the buyback program and dividends.

But none of those policies out of Washington have been set in stone yet. Apple, which had more than $246 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of its last quarter, authorized an increase of $50 billion to its capital return program in the second quarter of 2016. That included a plan to increase its buyback program to $175 billion from the $140 billion level it announced the prior year, and a 10% increase in its quarterly dividend to 57 cents a share. Absent major tax changes, RBC said Apple could maintain the $50 billion annual increase to its capital allocation program, which he estimates could include a 15% dividend increase. CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino said he expects Apple to increase its dividend by “at least 10%” and expand its buyback by up to $10 billion.

By JenniferBooton Reporter Apple Inc. is expected to report revenue at the high end of its guidance when it releases second-quarter earnings after the market closes Tuesday, fueled by the iPhone 7 Plus and continued growth in services. Apple AAPL, -0.59%   has shifted the tone of its earnings calls recently to focus on software and services in addition to its flagship hardware. While the iPhone remains Apple’s biggest top-line contributor by far, services such as Apple Care and Apple Music surpassed the Mac last year, as revenues topped $24 billion. Read Also: Apple gets permit to test driverless cars in California Last quarter, Apple CEO Tim Cook, who has referred to services as a “large and important source of recurring revenues” for the company, forecast that Apple’s services revenue would double by 2020. Credit Suisse analyst Kulbinder Garcha, who recently reiterated an outperform rating on the stock and lifted his price target to $170 from $160, said he believes services will grow to become 33% of Apple’s gross profit within a few years, with revenues increasing to $52 billion by 2020. Overall, analysts are expecting an in-line quarter. But it’s important to note that this fiscal year is being compared against a historically weak 2016, when Apple recorded its first annual revenue decline in more than a decade and suffered its first-ever decline in iPhone sales. Here’s what to expect: Earnings: Analysts expect Apple to report GAAP earnings per share of $2.02, up from $1.90 in the year-earlier period, according to FactSet. Estimize, a software platform that uses crowdsourcing from hedge-fund executives, brokerages and buy-side analysts to predict earnings, has Apple earning $2.07 a share. Apple has a long history of topping the FactSet consensus estimate, and it usually comes relatively in-line with the forecasts on Estimize, which tend to be a bit more bullish. Revenue: Sell-side analysts expect Apple to report revenue of $53 billion, according to FactSet, up from $50.5 billion in the same period last year. Contributors on Estimize are also forecasting revenue of $53 billion. In January, Apple set its guidance in the range of $51.5 billion to $53.5 billion. The company beat both the FactSet and Estimize consensus estimates last quarter but missed both in the prior quarter. Revenue from the iPhone is projected to increase by 4.3% to $34.3 billion, after gaining 5.3% in the key holiday quarter, according to FactSet. Apple is expected to have shipped 52 million phones during the quarter, up from 51 million in the year-earlier period, according to FactSet. Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty increased her price target on the stock to $161 from $154 last week, citing a higher-than-expected mix of iPhone 7 Plus sales. She raised her estimate on average selling prices to $753 from $713 currently, well above the $660 FactSet estimate. Revenue from services, which represents Apple’s fastest-growing and most profitable business segment, is expected to climb 18% to $7.1 billion this quarter, according to a FactSet survey of around 40 analysts. Stock reaction: Shares of Apple have been on a tear since the company’s last earnings report, fueled by an earnings beat, a bold outlook for its services business and demand for the iPhone 7 Plus, whose more expensive cost structure has increased average selling prices for the iPhone product category. The stock has hit and traded around all-time highs in recent weeks. Shares have gained 18% in the past three months, vastly outperforming the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.10%  , up 4.5%. They have increased by more than 38% in the past 12 months, versus a 17% improvement for the index. The S&P 500 SPX, -0.05%   has rallied 4% in the past three months and 14% in the past year. Read: Apple beef is all Qualcomm can talk about The average rating on Apple stock is the equivalent to buy, while the average price target among a poll of roughly 40 analysts surveyed by FactSet is $150.96, implying 4.5% upside to Tuesday’s closing price. What to watch for: Last quarter, Apple benefitted from holiday demand for the iPhone 7 and the massive recall of rival Samsung Electronics’ 005930, +2.43%  Galaxy Note 7, which led to a surge in customers switching from Android to iOS. This quarter, analysts will have their eye on Apple’s forecasts, with Samsung this week boasting record preorders for the Galaxy S8, its first product launch since the exploding-phone saga last fall. Mizuho analyst Abhey Lamba, who reiterated a buy rating and $150 price target on the stock this week, said he expects Apple’s outlook to come in “modestly below consensus.” The third quarter is typically the worst for iPhone sales, and the company will likely be expecting demand to taper — perhaps more than usual — ahead of the highly-anticipated iPhone 8 launch in September.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    How safe is the information you have stored on that little portable everything that buzzes in your pocket every two minutes? In case you've forgotten, it was a little over one year ago that Apple locked horns with the FBI, regarding an order from a federal magistrate in California, ordering the tech giant to help federal investigators try to get into an iPhone used by San Bernardino gunman Syed Rizwan Farook. It all started on Feb. 16, 2016 with an order from Judge Sheri Pym. After weeks of legal wrangling ended on March 29, 2016, Judge Pym vacated the order. The Justice Department withdrew legal action against Apple after a third entity, believed to be Israeli mobile forensics innovator Cellebrite, enabled the FBI to crack the IPhone’s security function — without erasing its contents. The information on the phone, used by Syed Farook, was seen as vital to the case. Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, carried out the Dec. 2, 2015 mass shooting in San Bernardino leaving 14 dead. It's reasonable to accept that Apple had a right to protect its customers but the fact that a private organization could decrypt the iPhone and provide that technology to the government raised many eyebrows. With so much vital information being stored on mobile devices, is our un-copyrighted intellectual property safe on our phones? Trade secrets, travel plans, even our personal and financial information could be potentially at risk if that decryption technology fell into the wrong hands. The question arises, should large technology companies or tech firms be forced to bow down to government entities? Then there is the 4th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, prohibiting unreasonable search and seizure. It establishes a requirement for governmental searches and seizures to be conducted only after the issuance of a warrant, one judicially issued, and one with probable cause; supported by oath or affirmation, one specifically describing the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized. For the federal government to single out the millions of Apple customers by sanctioning the creation of a decryption mechanism potentially exposes them to fraud should that mechanism fall into dishonest hands. Technology and information storage and transfer has been the foundation of modern life for the past generation — whether we like it or not. This vast technological backbone has a finite structure held together by security. When government strong-arms private businesses into compromising their relationship with consumers, it opens a Pandora’s box of potential infringement. We have seen how easily groups like Wikileaks and Anonymous have penetrated government networks. The potential for hackers and cybercrooks to destroy our sense of security regarding the private data we store on countless tech devices is a very real concern in our lives in the 21st century. Not only are potential privacy violations from the government as they solicit 3rd parties to create backdoors into our "personal effects," are an area of concern. Also conerning is that Apple and similar companies now have to reexamine their own encryption methods, to not only stay ahead of not only cybercrooks seeking private data on vulnerable sources such as our cell phones and personal computers, but legitimate governments as well. This certainly is not fair to the private sector. Most people are not aware of the protections we waive when we click on that little box to accept the terms and conditions of the software platforms we store our precious data on. Perhaps we should take the time to read them and educate ourselves on the way we potentially hand back the constitutional rights our brave founders risked their lives for with the simple click of a mouse.

In September, Apple released its iOS 10 operating system for select iPhone, iPad and iPod touch models around the world. In the months since its release, the company’s pushed several updates to iOS 10 users. These updates have delivered new features and bug fixes for lingering iOS 10 problems. Apple’s eradicated a number of iOS 10 problems but many still remain. iOS 10.3.1 users, and iPhone and iPad users on older versions of iOS 10, are complaining about a number of frustrating issues including abnormal battery drain. Updated to iOS 10.3, battery now lasts about 10 minutes. Usual apple update then #iOS #apple — mikeSalmond (@stresspuppie) March 29, 2017 Abnormal battery drain is a common iOS problem and it pops up every time Apple releases a new update for the iPhone, iPad and iPod touch. iOS updates aren’t supposed to have a negative effect on your device’s battery life so we’re not surprised to see some iPhone and iPad users expressing their frustration to Apple and its customer service representatives. How to Fix Bad iOS 10 Battery Life Fortunately, there are more than a few potential remedies for bad iOS 10 battery life issues. This guide will show you how to potentially fix bad iOS 10 battery life on your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch. Battery drain issues can be tricky but these fixes have worked well for us, and others, in the past. These fixes will work with all versions of iOS 10 including the company’s current version, the iOS 10.3.1 update. They should work for those of you running the iOS 10.3.2 beta as well. Check Your Apps Before you blame iOS 10 for your battery troubles, note that there’s a very good chance it’s something else causing the battery drain on your iPhone or iPad. If your battery life starts acting up with iOS 10 on board, the first place to look is at your collection of applications. There’s a very good chance an app, or apps, is hogging your device’s resources and causing the problem. The first place you’ll want to look is your Settings. Go into Settings > Battery and get familiar with the Battery Usage tool that arrived with the iOS 9 update in 2015. This tool will show you what apps are eating the most battery and when. Look for something out of the ordinary. If you do see something odd, check the App Store for an update. Developers are rolling out bug fixes and iOS 10 support updates that could improve performance. If an update fails to cure the issue, try reinstalling or uninstalling the app completely to see if that helps settle your device’s battery. Check Your Widgets Widgets are extremely prominent in iOS 10. And if you have a ton of widgets active, they could be sucking up a bunch of power in the background. If you’re experiencing terrible battery life, try getting a handle on your widgets. To get started, swipe to the right while on your device’s home screen. Scroll all the way to bottom of your widgets and select Edit. It’s a little circle icon. You should see a long list of services and apps. To remove a widget, tap the red circle with the white line and tap Remove. Remove as many as you desire and see if it has a positive effect on your battery’s performance. Use Low Power Mode If you haven’t been using iOS’ built-in Low Power Mode, now would be a good time to get familiar with this important feature. The iOS 9 update delivered a new feature called Low Power Mode. It’s important because it allows you to stretch out the last 10-20% of battery life on your device without having to make a bunch of manual changes. To enable Low Power Mode on your device go to Settings > Battery > Low Power Mode > On. This feature will help you conserve a few hours of battery life. Start using this feature on a regular basis. Use Airplane Mode If you suddenly start experiencing rapid battery drain, it might be because you’re in an area with poor cellular coverage. When you are in a bad service area, your iPhone or iPad will work hard to try and find a signal. This can cause your battery to drain rapidly. This is a perfect time to flip on Airplane Mode. Airplane Mode is found at the very top of your Settings and it will kill all of your connections when turned on. If you’ve done any air travel during the past few years, you’re probably familiar with the feature. Once you’ve entered a new service area, turn Airplane Mode off and you should notice an improvement to your device’s battery life. Disable iCloud Keychain If you don’t use iCloud Keychain, try disabling it to see if that improves battery life. This has worked for a number of people in the past. To disable iCloud Keychain on your device, you’ll want to go into Settings > iCloud > Keychain > Toggle iCloud Keychain off. If it doesn’t have a positive impact on battery, you can always toggle it back on when you need it again. Limit Background App Refresh Do you need your apps to automatically refresh in the background? No? Well then you might want to try disabling the Background App Refresh feature on your device. It could help you conserve battery life. Background App Refresh is handy because it will allows your apps to show you the latest data once you open them. It can also be a resource hog. If you don’t use or care about this feature, go to Settings > General > Background App Refresh > and turn it off for each app that is using too much power. It’s going to be an extremely tedious process for some of you but it could help your battery life. You can also turn the feature off completely if you don’t want to go through your list of applications one by one. If this doesn’t help, you can turn the feature back on for all of your apps or some of them. Manage Your Display Apple’s mobile devices use sensors to adjust the screen automatically in certain lighting environments. Sometimes these sensors work, sometimes they’re a little off. A bright screen can eat up battery life so we recommend getting a handle on your device’s display. First, try turning Auto Brightness off. To do this, go into Settings > Display & Brightness > Auto-Brightness > Off. Once you shut it off, you’ll have to adjust your screen brightness manually. this is easy with iOS 10. You can adjust it in your Settings in the Display & Brightness menu or you can simply swipe up from the bottom of the screen to bring up Control Center. Swipe up and you’ll see a bar that stretches across the length of the first Control Center card. Use it to adjust screen brightness. Turn Off Raise to Wake iOS’ Raise to Wake feature is handy but turning it off could help you save battery life. To turn off the Raise to Wake, go to Settings > Display & Brightness and then toggle the Raise to Wake function off. You can always turn it back on if you don’t see any gains. Restart Your iPhone or iPad If you’re looking for a quick fix, try a simple restart. Hold down the power button for a few seconds and swipe to shut the device down. Hold down the power button again to boot the device back up. Sometimes, this dislodges battery life issues. You can also try a hard reset. To do that, hold down the home button and the power button (volume down and power button on an iPhone 7/iPhone 7 Plus) for about 10 seconds. The device will restart itself. This won’t remove any data. Reset All Settings If none of these fixes help, it’s time to take more drastic measures to fix your bad iOS 10 battery life. The first solution we recommend is a reset of your settings. To do this, go to Settings > General > Reset > Reset All Settings and then enter your passcode. If you don’t have a passcode enabled, you obviously don’t need to replicate that step. This process should take five minutes or more and it will restore your settings to their factory defaults. So, make sure you have all of your Wi-Fi passwords handy because your phone or tablet will forget them. Downgrade to an Older Version of iOS 10 If you’d rather drop down to an older version of iOS you can do that. For a limited time. If you can’t tolerate iOS 10’s performance, you can drop back down to an older version to see if that improves your devices battery life. The downgrade loophole will only be open for a short time so you’ll need to act quickly if you want to make the move. For more on the process, take a look at our downgrade walkthrough. Upgrade to a Newer Version of iOS 10 If you’re running an older version of iOS 10 and you’re noticing abnormal battery drain, you might try upgrading to the current version of iOS 10. There’s no guarantee the iOS 10.3.1 update will solve your problem but we, and others, have noticed improvements. Restore the iOS 10 Update If you have a bunch of free time on your hands you can try a restore on your iPhone or iPad. This step should only be used as a last resort because it will temporarily erase everything on your device and could take awhile to complete. You can try restoring from your backup after you install iOS 10. If your iOS 10 battery life issues return after the restore, you will want to try this method again without restoring from your backup. Here’s how to do this on an iPhone, iPad or iPod touch: Plug in and backup to the computer or to iCloud. Turn off Find My iPhone – Settings -> iCloud -> Find my iPhone -> Off. In iTunes Click Restore. Follow the prompts and the iPhone will reinstall iOS 10 from scratch. When it completes click Restore from Backup to put your information back on the iPhone or Choose to set up as a new iPhone. Talk to Apple Support Online You should also get in contact with Apple support via its website or via Twitter. The company runs a Twitter account that takes questions about iOS problems and could help point you in the right direction. You can also get in touch with Apple Support via Apple’s website. Take Your Device Into an Apple Store If nothing on here works for you, and Apple’s online support fails, you could try taking your iPhone or iPad into an Apple Store to have a Genius run some diagnostics. Your issues could be related to a bloated battery, it could be something else entirely. If your device is still under warranty, they might even offer you a replacement. To find your closest Apple Store, head here. Buy a Battery Case If your device’s battery life still feels underwhelming, you might invest in a battery case. Battery cases can be bulky but they can also be lifesavers, particularly when you’re out traveling for work or pleasure. There are a ton of battery case options out there and our list of the best iPhone cases will help you get pointed in the right direction. 4 Reasons Not to Install iOS 10.3.1 & 9 Reasons You Should Install iOS 10.3.1 If You Want Better Security   1 / 13 If you value your security, you'll want to seriously consider downloading the iOS 10.3.1 update on your iPhone or iPad.  iOS 10.3.1 brings a single security patch for a potential Wi-Fi exploit. But if you failed to install iOS 10.3, your iOS 10.3.1 update will bring its monster list of patches as well.  The iOS 10.3 update delivered over 60 known patches for potential exploits. That's substantial, even for a milestone upgrade. The previous version of iOS 10, iOS 10.2.1, brought 14 known patches. Among them is a patch for a Safari ransomware bug that scammers used to extort iOS users who viewed pornography on their device.  These patches enhance the security on your iPhone, iPad and iPod touch making them ideal for those of you who store sensitive files/data on your device. Most people do. If you skipped the iOS 10.2.1 update and/or the iOS 10.2 update, know that iOS 10.3.1 brings their security patches with it as well. Again, the iOS 10.2.1 update had 14 important patches on board. You can see them all right here.  If you failed to install Apple's iOS 9.3.5 update, iOS 10.3.1 will also bring the three crucial security patches it delivered last year. These patch up serious security problems that could potentially expose your calls, contacts, texts, and emails. If security is important to you, iOS 10.3.1 is probably worth a download right now.   1 / 13 32 Responses 09/13/2016 tug Reply this is stupid.. if previously u dont have much issue having all the same settings.. all the same cellular coverage.. the problem is the iOS 10 itself.. asking someone to switch off this and that is not exactly the solution 09/14/2016 Z Reply For me the battery status shows that Messages app took 51% of battery in the background. Ridiculous. Turned imessage off and swiped up messages app from the background and i see a better battery. 09/22/2016 Leo Reply I play a lot of games when i was on the 9.3.5 firmware and battery wasn’t that bad but when I do it on IOS 10 it drains so fast. So obviously theres a problem with it. 10/04/2016 We're The Phucarwe Reply Silly. Nothing in here addresses the inherent battery-draining qualities of yet another Apple downdate. Most of the “enhanced” features are aimed at improving apple’s bottom line rather than your device performance. I’m beginning to think more and more about abandoning a ship I’ve been sailing since the 80’s. C’mon, Apple. 10/06/2016 SUZANNE HAMOOD Reply there need to be yet another update to the IOS10. we should NOT be paying 700.00 for a phone that wont hold a battery charge for 8 hours. I have noticed a HUGH difference and I am not a big phone user. I could usually start off the day with a 100% and if not used much that day end the day with more than 50% Its 2:30 in the afternoon and I haven’t Hardley touched my phone today its at 34% WTF!!! 10/07/2016 Steve miller Reply My 6s battery dies so fast with as much shut off and manual fetch email setting have helped a little but at 1% it seems to last for hours for some reason. I think the battery is still fine but something is ip with the battery indicator 10/08/2016 Jonas Reply Same apps, same settings and the difference is 9% battery drain over night compared to not even 1% on IOS 9. By % that is ridiculous and nearly and insane difference…. As other mentioned, this guide does not have much to do with battery tuning iOS 10, although in general terms it may work, but not for we who haven’t changed anything… 10/09/2016 Elle Reply for some reason my 6 drains at night after i upgraded the ios. Now every time I turn on my phone, instead of my lock screen I see my music screen and I’ve turned off that app. I went form 86% right before bed and woke up to 21%. 10/10/2016 Brian Reply My 5c says the battery life is fine, 50% plus, then without warning the phone will power down. When I try to power it back up, it shows the battery as being dead as a post. So I plug the phone in, and the phone immediately powers up, and shows the battery life as being where it was before it powered down…that was 57% this morning. 10/10/2016 Rene Girardin Reply Here is a link to interesting discussions about iOS 10.0.2 and Fast Battery Drain on all iPhones. All the bla bla about how to lower battery usage is OK but there is a bug introduced in Network Settings. https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7685072?start=30&tstart=0 10/11/2016 Matthew Grimsley Reply same with my ipone 6S. happened twice over the weekend. 10/13/2016 Ann Reply I think it’s so funny how our phones have a good battery life until an update comes along, but then it goes to poop and we are informed “Oh it’s probably dat app you using and not iOS 10” seriously??? 10/13/2016 Colin Nias Reply Even the staff in the Apple shops are reluctant to admit there is a problem, even though its plastered all over the internet. My 6 plus has the same issues, 100% in the morning, by 6pm I’m down to 25%. Loads of apps are still working in the background, Facebook and Mail seem to be the main culprits on mine. Apple really need to up their game and stop messing around with things. Listen, if it aint broke, don’t fix it. Simples!!! 10/13/2016 RB Reply Worthless article … “If you previously did not have issues wiith battery power and now do after installing iOS 10, the problem is likely something else and not iOS 10.” Makes perfect sense. 10/16/2016 Luigi Reply Guys I too have the same problem! I am angry!! But is it possible that these Apple release an update that sucks the battery like a ferrari to 240km / h ??? !! But crazy stuff !! It lasts less than half the time of use which I did with iOS 9. But what the heck !!! Apple immediately solve this problem !! Otherwise I swear that I buy an iPhone no longer !! 10/18/2016 jamie pollock Reply full charge at 7am… 3:30pm my iphone 6 shows 90% avail. Nothing special about my setup, I check email and send Texts during the day. I just don’t talk on it much nor use GPS. IOs 10 too. I must be lucky 10/19/2016 Mike Reply ISO 10 is a joke we pay to much and for the phone and service to have to go through this on every major update now it’s the worse it’s ever been I also have a iPhones 5 that says 33% and it just turns off and I have to plug it in and it comes back on with the same amount of power 33% wtf is the deal it’s like the older the phone the worse like they are trying to force everyone to buy the newest phone apple is about to have another class action law suit how many can they take at on time I love my iPhone but there seriously pushing me away and it seem like there doing it to a lot of customers bad business they need to do there homework before they release another update load it to a few different phones and models before you release shit 10/24/2016 Curtis S Reply Privacy > Location Services > System Services Turn off everything except Emergency SOS and Find My iPhone. 10/24/2016 Greg M Reply Hi I have updated my Ipad and now not only at first most of my Apps disappeared, Now it wont even charge to let me check things Surely an outfit like yours has have some accountability for this, this is a disgrace , I had been using this for my business, NOT Happy at all. 10/28/2016 Kai Reply Do not update to IOS 10…I repeat do not update. 10.1 does not help either. Battery life 10 mins if not plug into a charger. Constantly crashes and get stuck in reboot loop. Apple genius swear there is nothing wrong with the software when I brought my iPhone 6 in. Battery life performance at 80% when ran diagnostics, genius solution was to have it replaced. My only solution is to have the phone plug in a portable charger all day and remain plugged everywhere I go. Just waiting on the 7 to be in stock…if same problem arrives, I will be officially done with apple. 10/31/2016 David Harfst Reply This is not a problem with the apps draining the battery. It’s a bug, in my opinion, with how iOS monitors the battery. I’ve had my phone at 80% and all of the sudden it shuts off, and won’t power back on saying the battery is dead. Once I hook it up to power, it comes back on, still says it’s at 80%, and I can then disconnect from power again and it’s fine. This is happenning all the time since upgrading. The latter versions of iOS 9 did this too, but it would have to be down at 20 or 30%. I believe iOS 10.0.1 was better, but since going to 10.0.2, it’s worse again. This is a real pain. 11/03/2016 TS Reply Nothing listed here is a fix. These are all kluge-y awkward workarounds, none of which should be necessary with a properly-functioning OS. 11/20/2016 Mark Clulow Reply TOTALLY Shouldn’t have to go through all this though, this in nonsense. BOOOOOO! 12/31/2016 Kenneth Wilson Reply The problem is definitely the OS. IT seems Apple is trying to push people into buying new phones. Went to Apple. Did the whole reset thing.. no change. The y then suggest it was probably the because it would not charge in their kiosk and to replace it would be $300.00. Take the phone home and the phone charges without any issues. Changed every setting possible with no change. The IPhone 6 would last about 2 hours without doing anything on it. Changed the battery out. still no change. Ended up downloading the Public beta 10.2.1 Beta 2. Phone went from 2 hours to 8 hours with not really using the phone. It still has problems, but at least this helped, But Apple is definitely hiding something. 01/08/2017 pete Reply This is ridiculous. How is this a fix for the iOS battery drain problems? Clickbait. 01/25/2017 robert walker Reply bob, after installing ios 10.0.2 on my iphone5 after recharging and with 100% recharged,without using the phone at all it lost 40% of the charge ,something wrong big time apple . 01/28/2017 Stacey Reply I started with 100% battery life when I went to bed. Played a game for about 15 min and turned that off. Set the alarm, went to bed. Woke up wondering why my alarm didn’t go off on my phone. My phone was dead with only 2% battery life. I deleted the game, thinking it may have caused trouble, but it was only using 30% of my battery. Today after 100% charge and not using my phone, it’s already lost over 20% charge. Something is draining my battery and came here looking to see if I was the only one with an abnormally draining battery after 10.2.1 update. I use an iphone 7. Think I’ll go with Samsung galaxy for my next phone. Had troubles with iphone 6 with updates and I lost cellular connection with iphone 6, now having troubles again. Been one thing after another. I’m losing 1% of battery life every few minutes. I don’t have app refresh on either. Hope this gets fixed! 02/11/2017 Tim Reply Since upgraded to IOS 10, my Iphone 6 shuts off left and right with plenty of battery life left. Sometimes shuts off at 90% battery. This is messsed up! 02/12/2017 Rosemary Reply Since I upgraded to iOS 10.2 my battery has been draining up to 30% overnight & lasts no time at all throughout the day. I bought apple iPad Air as the battery life was 10 hours. Now I’m lucky to get 2-3hours. I’m really annoyed by this. I’ve had to follow online advice about switching off apps & conserving battery life by basically not using my iPad! Even with all this, there’s no great improvement. Is Apple going to fix this situation? It’s like they’ve bugged their own customers’ devices! Not the smartest move. I’m frustrated & let down. 03/08/2017 Karen Parker Reply “There’s no guarantee the iOS 10.2.1 update will solve your problem but we, and others, have noticed improvements.” I disagree as I did not have the battery drain issue until I installed 10.2.1. I have made all your recommended changes, turned off all notifications, and still getting less than 8 hours on a charge. If you go to Apple support they just keep up with the same old recommendations and will not even take ownership of the issue. So fed up I am ready to switch to Android if Apple doesn’t fix this nonsense soon. 03/12/2017 Nicole Seiler Reply 2 weeks after my 2 year contract ran out, by end of December 2016, I started to have serious battery problems on iPhone 6. It came suddenly, just like that. I hadn’t done any update. I am still on IOS 9.3.2. I didn’t risk to update on IOS 10, afraid issues will get worse. Example: I leave the house iPhone charged 100%. 1,5 hours later: 75%. I was maybe 15 minutes on Facebook in those 1,5 hours. One hour later I got a phonecall. I noticed that battery now showed just 57%. The call didn’t last more than 2 minutes. The iPhone shut down after the call. I hang it on an extern battery, it showed again 47%. 04/26/2017 Susan Griffiths Reply Hi my name is Susan, what l want to know about l have a old iPhone 4s what’s happened the battery life dead there no life in it at all what can l do to get it working Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

In fact, Tim Cook’s company is said to have abandoned the “s” upgrades to focus solely on two next-generation handsets that will be launched as iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus.  This Tuesday, Chinese tech blog Micgadget.com stated that new information from Apple supply chain Foxconn is saying that there are only two new iPhone models in the works. The blog learned from insiders that the Cupertino giant is not going to debut three iPhone models as previously rumored. Instead, there would only be two 2017 models that will be unveiled as 10th anniversary handsets.  The Chinese site’s sources also claimed that Foxconn will receive the materials it needs to assemble the phones in the last week of June. Not only that, there is mention of display-embedded Touch ID sensors and the inclusion of dual cameras in both the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus.  READ: Will iPhone 8 sport better display than Galaxy S8?  However, MacRumors says Microgadget.com’s report is questionable since it’s unusual for supply chain insider information to go against what’s already been established by leaks at this point when production is about to start. Furthermore, the blog itself does not have a solid track record for outing accurate details on Apple’s activities.  In March of this year, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo stated that the tech giant is releasing three iPhones: a 4.7-inch model, another with 5.5-inch LCD display and a flagship device that will sport OLED display. This has since been the basis of many other reports from various tech sites, especially when other leaks point to the same idea.  Should Apple really go with releasing an iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus this September, it means the company is ditching its usual “s” upgrades this year. It also means Apple will follow Samsung’s footsteps in debuting only two flagship phones just like what the latter did when it unveiled the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ during its Unpacked event in late March.  iPhonesMore Apple is reportedly releasing only two iPhones this year.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple New leak shuts down the worst iPhone 8 rumor and hints at wireless charging Chris Mills BGR News April 26, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share Over the past few weeks, we’ve heard troubling rumors that Apple is thinking about putting a Touch ID sensor on the back of the iPhone 8. The move would be necessary to eliminate the bottom bezel on the device, enabling the fitting of an edge-to-edge display that’s all the hot rage in tech these days. But it would also be a middle finger to common sense, and mercifully, it seems that the rumors might be just that. Don't Miss: The iPhone 8 will destroy the Galaxy S8, if this leaked benchmark is true A new schematic spotted (but not verified) by OnLeaks shows the back panel for some kind of iPhone 8-shaped device. It has the dual camera lenses we’ve heard so much about and the physical design lines up with other leaks, but there’s one big difference: no cut-out for a fingerprint sensor on the back. This is a tipped leak what means I can't confirm if legit or not but there you have it… #iPhone8 pic.twitter.com/6OgASNUDNb — OnLeaks (@OnLeaks) April 26, 2017 Hopefully, that indicates that Apple is going to wait to launch the iPhone 8 until it has an under-screen fingerprint reader working. That would let Apple keep Touch ID — a necessity in any new flagship smartphone — without compromising the all-screen design it’s pushing for. Even if it delays the iPhone 8 launch for months, it’ll be worth it. So if there’s no cut-out for a fingerprint sensor, we have to start puzzling over the large circular support shown in the middle of the back on this schematic. It’s too large for a fingerprint sensor, but looks just right for a charging coil to allow for induction wireless charging. That’s one of the other features that’s long been rumored for the iPhone 8, but this is the first schematic we’ve seen that hints at it. If that support is for a charging coil, the size and location hint at a traditional wireless charging solution, which requires you to position a device on a charging mat. We’ve been hopeful that the kind of wireless charging Apple is working on would give you some limited movement with the iPhone in your hand — think lying in bed, with a charging source positioned a foot away — but it looks here like Apple is just going to be keeping up with the competition. Still, this is all just speculation at this point: even if the leaked schematic is real, there’s months left until any kind of reveal. Apple is likely testing a number of different prototypes at this point, and has mocked up hundreds of different designs. One leaked drawing isn’t confirmation of anything just yet.

Twitter Facebook How HP reclaimed the title of world's top PC maker from Lenovo HP cut unprofitable products, trimmed its offerings, sharpened its PC designs, and is again the world's top PC maker Agam Shah (IDG News Service) 27 April, 2017 05:39 - - - - print email Comments In late 2015, HP was reborn as a PC maker following a split of its parent organization, Hewlett-Packard. At the time, HP was a lost cause, and its double-digit decline in PC shipments was a main reason for the split. The new HP then set out to reclaim its spot as the world's top PC maker from Lenovo, a title it lost in 2013. It reached the goal in the first quarter of 2017, during which its PC shipments grew by 13.1 percent year over year. A series of cool products and decisions to cut off low-margin products helped HP return to the top. Lenovo's struggles also played a part, but HP's strong performance in North America was a deciding factor, IDC said. To reach the top, HP took on an Apple-like role of being an innovator and focused on profitable products. At the same time, it cut products like its Slate PCs, some low-cost Stream laptops, TouchSmart all-in-ones, Omni PCs, and other devices that were key offerings in the past. In December 2015, HP also cut low-cost tablets and Android devices, due to fierce competition and a drop in prices. Tablet demand was declining, and low-cost alternatives were available by the dozens. "We saw the consumer tablet market as the opposite -- low-value being flooded with cheap devices with Shenzhen," said Ron Coughlin, president for personal systems at HP. "We didn't think that would provide the customers or shareholders with the right value." Armed with market research and engineering expertise, HP then set out to redesign its PCs into smaller and more attractive form factors. Products like 2-in-1s were designed to appeal to buyers like millennials, many of whom don't mind spending the extra buck for a device that looks sophisticated. "We don't chase share for share's sake. We could have discounted our way to the share gains we had, but that wasn't our plan at all," Coughlin said. In 2016, HP released products like the super-thin Spectre 13, the modular HP Slice desktop, and the Z2 Mini desktop, which packs the power of a tower PC in a small form factor. "People wanted a smaller footprint, but they wanted the same power," Coughlin said. HP also released the Pavilion Wave PC, a modern take on Apple's Mac Pro. The company also reversed some of its past mistakes. It re-entered the high-end PC gaming market, which it exited when it folded the Voodoo PC unit in 2008. Gaming PCs have been the bright spot in an otherwise slumping PC market, and in August, HP introduced a range of innovative high-end Omen gaming PCs, which had similar color tones to the Voodoo PCs. The "high-value" Omen PCs are taking market share away from conventional gaming PC makers, and gaming is a profitable market, Coughlin said. But it's the volume-selling products like the Pavilion, EliteBook, Spectre, and Envy that sold well and helped HP's market share grow. Many of the laptops are thinner, smaller and sleeker than older HP products, and 2-in-1 products are selling well. With all of HP's success, it had some duds too. One questionable product was the Elite X3, a Windows 10 Mobile smartphone targeted at enterprise businesses. Windows 10 Mobile smartphone shipments are declining, and the OS could be on its last legs. But for Coughlin, the Elite X3 is targeted at the commercial mobility market, which is underserved. HP has pitched Elite X3 as a device that can be used as a PC in a pinch and can be used to run commercial applications via the cloud. Many organizations are already using it as a computing device, Coughlin said. "In mobility, we aren't standing still. You'll see some exciting news coming out shortly," Coughlin said. HP has no plans to enter the consumer mobile phone market, however. "There's only one or two players that make money there," Coughlin said. "We thought that market wasn't important for us." One market that's important to HP as it looks to grow its PC business is virtual reality. The company plans to start shipping its Omen X VR backpack PC starting in June, and by the end of the year, will ship a Windows Mixed Reality headset that needs to be tethered to PCs. HP also plans to blend augmented reality into the PC in a different way than other vendors are. A PC like Sprout, with an attached 3D camera, will be a good "on ramp" for 3D, and HP's MultiJet Fusion 3D printer will manufacture tangible products, Coughlin said. For example, the company will make it possible to build custom shoes using its PC, scanner, and a 3D printer technologies. A Sprout-like PC will be able to scan a foot in a footbed with pressure plates. From the scan, HP's Jet Fusion 3D printer will be able to make the custom insole, and ultimately, whole shoes. Looking into the future, Coughlin predicted vendors will sell "smart PCs" that can protect themselves and self-repair. For example, a PC will be able to detect if a hard drive is failing and then fix it during computer downtime. More intelligence will be built into secure PCs, Coughlin said. There will also be a move to the PC as a service, mostly targeted at enterprises. It will involve leasing instead of paying a full price for a device. HP has exciting announcements coming in the future related to gaming, VR, and mobility, Coughlin said. "We're mean, lean and focused. This company was founded on innovation," he said. 7 Habits of the Effective Network Manager More from NetScout Join the Computerworld newsletter! Join Error: Please check your email address.

How HP reclaimed the title of world's top PC maker from Lenovo HP cut unprofitable products, trimmed its offerings, sharpened its PC designs, and is again the world's top PC maker Agam Shah (IDG News Service) on 27 April, 2017 05:39 0 - - - - print email In late 2015, HP was reborn as a PC maker following a split of its parent organization, Hewlett-Packard. At the time, HP was a lost cause, and its double-digit decline in PC shipments was a main reason for the split. The new HP then set out to reclaim its spot as the world's top PC maker from Lenovo, a title it lost in 2013. It reached the goal in the first quarter of 2017, during which its PC shipments grew by 13.1 percent year over year. A series of cool products and decisions to cut off low-margin products helped HP return to the top. Lenovo's struggles also played a part, but HP's strong performance in North America was a deciding factor, IDC said. To reach the top, HP took on an Apple-like role of being an innovator and focused on profitable products. At the same time, it cut products like its Slate PCs, some low-cost Stream laptops, TouchSmart all-in-ones, Omni PCs, and other devices that were key offerings in the past. In December 2015, HP also cut low-cost tablets and Android devices, due to fierce competition and a drop in prices. Tablet demand was declining, and low-cost alternatives were available by the dozens. "We saw the consumer tablet market as the opposite -- low-value being flooded with cheap devices with Shenzhen," said Ron Coughlin, president for personal systems at HP. "We didn't think that would provide the customers or shareholders with the right value." Armed with market research and engineering expertise, HP then set out to redesign its PCs into smaller and more attractive form factors. Products like 2-in-1s were designed to appeal to buyers like millennials, many of whom don't mind spending the extra buck for a device that looks sophisticated. "We don't chase share for share's sake. We could have discounted our way to the share gains we had, but that wasn't our plan at all," Coughlin said. In 2016, HP released products like the super-thin Spectre 13, the modular HP Slice desktop, and the Z2 Mini desktop, which packs the power of a tower PC in a small form factor. "People wanted a smaller footprint, but they wanted the same power," Coughlin said. HP also released the Pavilion Wave PC, a modern take on Apple's Mac Pro. The company also reversed some of its past mistakes. It re-entered the high-end PC gaming market, which it exited when it folded the Voodoo PC unit in 2008. Gaming PCs have been the bright spot in an otherwise slumping PC market, and in August, HP introduced a range of innovative high-end Omen gaming PCs, which had similar color tones to the Voodoo PCs. The "high-value" Omen PCs are taking market share away from conventional gaming PC makers, and gaming is a profitable market, Coughlin said. But it's the volume-selling products like the Pavilion, EliteBook, Spectre, and Envy that sold well and helped HP's market share grow. Many of the laptops are thinner, smaller and sleeker than older HP products, and 2-in-1 products are selling well. With all of HP's success, it had some duds too.

Andrew Grant HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 I've had a multifunction printer in the office going on 10 years now. It was a neat bit of kit back in the day -- print, copy, scan, fax -- when printing over WiFi felt a bit like magic. It’s seen better days though and an upgrade’s well overdue. This HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 looks like it ticks all the same boxes: print, copy, scan, and fax. (Really? Does anyone fax anything any more? I guess it's good to know the facility’s there, just in case.) Printing over WiFi is more-or- less standard these days. Ed Dawson HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 As a freelance writer who is always on the go, I like my technology to be both efficient and effective so I can do my job well. The HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 Inkjet Printer ticks all the boxes in terms of form factor, performance and user interface. Michael Hargreaves Windows 10 for Business / Dell XPS 13 I’d happily recommend this touchscreen laptop and Windows 10 as a great way to get serious work done at a desk or on the road. Aysha Strobbe Windows 10 / HP Spectre x360 Ultimately, I think the Windows 10 environment is excellent for me as it caters for so many different uses. The inclusion of the Xbox app is also great for when you need some downtime too! Mark Escubio Windows 10 / Lenovo Yoga 910 For me, the Xbox Play Anywhere is a great new feature as it allows you to play your current Xbox games with higher resolutions and better graphics without forking out extra cash for another copy. Although available titles are still scarce, but I’m sure it will grow in time.

While the administration has not yet determined a rate at which those funds could be repatriated, Trump’s proposal unveiled Wednesday promises a “one-time tax on trillions of dollars held overseas.” U.S. companies had about $1.3 trillion in cash held in overseas accounts at the end of 2016, according to Moody’s Investors Service.

Unfortunately, that’s exactly what Powermat CEO Elad Dubzinski did. Powermat CEO says Apple announced iPhone 8 wireless charging The big takeaway from Powermat’s press release is Dubzinski stating, With the recent announcement by Apple that wireless charging will become a standard feature in the next iPhone, we are finally at the threshold of mainstream adoption. That’s a pretty amazing statement considering Apple hasn’t made any such announcement. Rumors and insider speculation claim the iPhone 8, Apple’s expected premium iPhone model coming this fall, will include wireless charging support. That’s a far cry, however, from Apple announcing the feature and confirming the iPhone 8 is real. According to analysts and insider sources, Apple will unveil the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus this fall, along with a higher end model tentatively dubbed iPhone 8. Or maybe iPhone X. Or possibly iPhone Edition. It’ll sport a 5.8-inch OLED display that runs pretty much edge to egde on a phone that’s the same size as the iPhone 7. The iPhone 8 will supposedly also have a glass back, A11 processor, 3D-sensing front-facing cameras and dual vertical stacked rear-facing cameras, a virtual Home button instead of a physical one, Touch ID embedded in the display glass, OLED display, and support for wireless charging. Since wireless charging is Powermat’s jam, it’s possible Dubzinski has insider knowledge if his company has partnered with Apple for conductive charging plates. Alternately, he may have mistakenly assumed the iPhone 8 rumors are an official Apple announcement. Regardless, the internet is flipping out today thinking the still unannounced iPhone 8’s wireless charging rumor has been confirmed. Either Dubzinski screwed his company out of any future Apple deals by spilling the beans on an unannounced iPhone feature, or he looks pretty foolish for thinking rumors are actually an Apple statement. Here’s the deal: Apple hasn’t announced any new iPhone models, and most likely won’t until September. Odds are good we’ll see three models announced: the iPhone 7s, the iPhone 7s Plus, and the iPhone 8. The 7s and 7s Plus will ship within a few days, and the 8 will ship several weeks later in very limited quantities. That’s based on Apple’s track record, leaks, and analyst speculation—not official Apple announcements. And on a side note, CompuCom CEO Dan Stone is Powermat’s new Chairman of the Board.

The more I think about it, the more it makes sense. There are some pretty compelling indications that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is interested in space internet, given the company's recent hiring of spacecraft and satellite experts. While Apple could be up to something else, building a constellation of satellites to beam gigabit internet to Earth could make sense on so many levels. Let's look at this potential moonshot from every angle, and by the end I think you'll agree with me: Apple should do it. Steve Jobs wanted to create a cell network There are old stories about how Steve Jobs had envisioned Apple creating a cell network for the iPhone, vertically integrating into that part of the value chain. Apple originally thought of building a network on unlicensed spectrum bands (like the ones that Wi-Fi currently operate in). While removing dependence on carriers sounds appealing on a strategic level, the idea didn't make it that far, probably since building a network is massively expensive; the largest U.S. carriers spend $20 billion per year in capital expenditures. Separately, there had been more recent rumors of Apple creating a mobile virtual network operator (MVNO), buying wholesale capacity from the carriers and reselling it under its own brand. CEO Tim Cook promptly squashed that scuttlebutt in 2016, but there should be little doubt that Apple considered the idea. Why Apple keeps thinking about networks At the same time, you may have noticed that depending on third-party carriers has become a liability for Apple in some markets, particularly emerging ones. LTE coverage is quite poor in many parts of the world, which severely compromises the value proposition of mobile devices. For example, Cook has cited poor LTE penetration as one of Apple's key hurdles in India, but India isn't alone in this regard. Creating a space internet network has the potential to free Apple from third-party network road maps, directly bringing high-speed connectivity to every corner of the Earth. Importantly, this would allow Apple to sell an iPhone to anyone, anywhere. Satellite phones have been around for decades, but have historically been relegated to military and industrial uses due to the high costs. Regular cellphones are perfectly sufficient for the average consumer. But Apple has a long history of democratizing high-end technologies and bringing those technologies to the mainstream. Services revenue potential We already know that SpaceX is planning its own space internet network, which could launch as early as 2019. Thanks to documents leaked to The Wall Street Journal  earlier this year, we also know the company's financial forecasts. SpaceX estimates that it could generate $30 billion in revenue in 2025 from delivering space internet service to 40 million subscribers. If we use those figures, that translates into about $750 per subscriber per year — more  than the average price of an iPhone ($695 in the fourth quarter). At $62.50 per month, that's just slightly higher than what consumers currently pay for cell service. Another challenge for Apple in emerging markets has been the premium pricing of the iPhone. Imagine if Apple were to bundle iPhones with integrated service beamed down from the stars. Knowing that it could collect recurring revenue, Apple could justify lowering the upfront cost of the device itself in order to spur unit sales. On top of that, the company could improve its already high user retention, and still count on hardware upgrades at regular intervals. Let's call it iPhone-and-Space-Internet-as-a-Service (iPSIaaS). (Kidding.) This is all in line with Apple's growing services ambitions, and I think we can all agree that space internet is the ultimate service. A small price to pay Of course, we have to consider the cost to build and deploy such a network. Facebook had tapped SpaceX to launch an internet satellite to bring connectivity to rural Africa last year, but the rocket unfortunately exploded on the launch pad. It was a $200 million satellite intended for geostationary orbit, hovering above the Earth with an orbital velocity matching the Earth's rotation so that it would appear fixed to terrestrial observers. That would allow the internet satellite to provide continuous coverage for a designated geographical region. Apple could surgically launch internet satellites in regions that have the most strategic value  namely, emerging markets where cellular network infrastructure is immature. Over time, perhaps Apple could expand to developed markets, threatening carriers in the process, but there would be much less need to start there. Each SpaceX launch costs a little over $60 million, a dramatic reduction from traditional launch costs, and that's before factoring in any discounts for customers that agree to launch on a reused rocket. For Apple, those costs are quite reasonable given how much a space internet initiative would make sense. Go for it, Tim. Evan Niu, CFA owns shares of Apple and FB.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile Image Source: Weibo New leak shuts down the worst iPhone 8 rumor and hints at wireless charging Chris Mills @chrisfmills April 26th, 2017 at 2:31 PM Share Tweet Over the past few weeks, we’ve heard troubling rumors that Apple is thinking about putting a Touch ID sensor on the back of the iPhone 8. The move would be necessary to eliminate the bottom bezel on the device, enabling the fitting of an edge-to-edge display that’s all the hot rage in tech these days. But it would also be a middle finger to common sense, and mercifully, it seems that the rumors might be just that. Don't Miss: The iPhone 8 will destroy the Galaxy S8, if this leaked benchmark is true A new schematic spotted (but not verified) by OnLeaks shows the back panel for some kind of iPhone 8-shaped device. It has the dual camera lenses we’ve heard so much about and the physical design lines up with other leaks, but there’s one big difference: no cut-out for a fingerprint sensor on the back. This is a tipped leak what means I can't confirm if legit or not but there you have it… #iPhone8 pic.twitter.com/6OgASNUDNb — OnLeaks (@OnLeaks) April 26, 2017 Hopefully, that indicates that Apple is going to wait to launch the iPhone 8 until it has an under-screen fingerprint reader working. That would let Apple keep Touch ID — a necessity in any new flagship smartphone — without compromising the all-screen design it’s pushing for. Even if it delays the iPhone 8 launch for months, it’ll be worth it. So if there’s no cut-out for a fingerprint sensor, we have to start puzzling over the large circular support shown in the middle of the back on this schematic. It’s too large for a fingerprint sensor, but looks just right for a charging coil to allow for induction wireless charging. That’s one of the other features that’s long been rumored for the iPhone 8, but this is the first schematic we’ve seen that hints at it. If that support is for a charging coil, the size and location hint at a traditional wireless charging solution, which requires you to position a device on a charging mat. We’ve been hopeful that the kind of wireless charging Apple is working on would give you some limited movement with the iPhone in your hand — think lying in bed, with a charging source positioned a foot away — but it looks here like Apple is just going to be keeping up with the competition. Still, this is all just speculation at this point: even if the leaked schematic is real, there’s months left until any kind of reveal. Apple is likely testing a number of different prototypes at this point, and has mocked up hundreds of different designs. One leaked drawing isn’t confirmation of anything just yet.

Media Creation | 26 Apr 2017 | Print  | Comment (0) Apple’s New Clips App Is iMovie for the Social Age by Julio Ojeda-Zapata I wasn’t sure at first what to make of Apple’s new Clips app for iOS, which joins a crowded field of phone and tablet apps for video recording, editing, and sharing. Is it a rival of sorts to Snapchat and Instagram Stories with its own set of emojis, visual effects and the like for zany social-media-style video sharing? Or is Clips more of an iMovie-style app for cobbling together moderately complex video productions from an array of individual clips? It’s both. Apple has essentially retooled iMovie for the Snapchat age in an attempt to make video editing more accessible, enjoyable and, well, social. At least, that’s the intent. In its current 1.0 state, Clips is a flawed app, though not irretrievably. Here’s what Clips is not. It is not a video-sharing front end for a particular social network, the way Snapchat and Instagram Stories are. Apple has no social network of its own — it tried that unsuccessfully with iTunes Ping in 2010. Instead, sharing of Clips videos is agnostic, occurring by way of share sheets to social networks, messaging services, cloud storage, and video-hosting sites, among other destinations. Clips is also not a generator of ephemeral videos of the sort that disappear after a while, like those on Snapchat. The Basics -- Apple has attempted to make Clips dead simple but sometimes sabotages the app with features so deeply hidden that users will be lucky to find them. It’s almost as if Apple were emulating Snapchat, which is notorious for its opaque interface. And by “opaque,” we mean “bad.” Getting started with Clips is a breeze, though. Tap New Video at the top, and you launch a new project, much as you would in iMovie. A key difference: Clips videos are always square for compatibility with social networks and other sharing destinations. To record video, tap and hold a red, oval-shaped button at the bottom. If you don’t want to keep your finger on the screen the whole time, flick left to lock the app in video-recording mode. The flick-to-lock option is one of those hidden features I mentioned. Before recording, you can optionally tap the microphone button to mute audio and create clips without sound, or tap the familiar camera-switching button to switch between the front- and rear-facing cameras. Clips can also take photos, but they’re for animating in videos, not for static display. Switch from Video to Photo mode and tap the shutter button to snap a photo. You are then prompted to hold down that red button (for at least a few seconds) to create a video clip that is nothing but the still image. Here’s the trick to turning that photo into a video. As you’re “recording” a photo by holding the red button, you can pinch outward or inward with two fingers for a zooming effect, or use one finger to move the photo horizontally or vertically for a panning effect. That’s right, you get to be Ken Burns! Animating photos makes them more compelling, but this feels awkward in the execution. Clips appears to smooth out motion in the final product, happily. You can import videos and photos from the Photos camera roll into Clips, too, and you animate imported photos in the same way as those you take in Clips. As you create clips within a video, they line up in a tidy row along the bottom, and you can rearrange or discard them with your finger. Tap a clip to reveal a simple set of editing tools, include a muting option and a scissors tool for changing a clip’s duration using familiar left and right sliders. There’s also a trash button you can tap to delete the clip. Fancy Stuff -- Enough basics — let’s get into the wackier features. Clips provides five tools along the top that enhance videos in interesting ways: subtitling, filters, stickers, posters, and soundtracks. First up is an audio-transcription feature in Clips — what Apple calls “animated captions.” Tap the button shaped like a speech bubble. You are presented with seven caption styles. Pick one and get set to record. As you press and hold the red button to record video, use your voice to narrate. Magically, your enunciated words are transformed into subtitles. Clips won’t always nail the audio-to-text conversion, but you can fix errors. Tap the relevant clip and hit the play button on the lower left. When the subtitles appear, pause the clip and tap the text. An edit window appears. Modify the text and tap Apply. This is yet another of those deeply buried features. The second button lets you apply filters to your video. No surprises here – filters in Clips are similar to the filters found in other social apps, and in Apple’s Camera app. One of the Clips filters makes video look like a comic book, and another offers a black-and-white effect that looks hand-drawn. The filters are nice, but Clips offers only seven, which seems stingy given abundant offerings elsewhere. Tap the next button, which looks a bit like the Daring Fireball star logo, and you get speech bubbles and other stickers for cluttering up video to your heart’s content. There are adornments like “Nice!” and “WOW!” – and you can edit the text within the stickers. All the elements can be repositioned, rotated, and resized with finger manipulations. Slide to the left while in the sticker screen to access the last 30 emojis you used. All of Apple’s emojis are available, in fact, but getting to them is unintuitive. First, add an emoji to a video. Then, tap it to make your device’s keyboard appear. You’ll then have access to your full library of emojis. Next up in the zany-feature parade are full-screen, animated posters with text in various styles. You might want to use them at the beginning or end of videos, or mixed in to create chapter headings. My favorite is a TV-news-style panel that reads “Tonight.” As with the bubbles and labels, you can edit the text. Apple offers only a dozen posters, alas. The final stop on our feature tour: music tracks or “soundtracks” to use as mood music. Soundtracks come in a range of styles like Pop, Playful, Chill, Sentimental, Retro, Action, and Holidays & Events. Tap one of the tracks to add it to your production. One track, The Summit, is by none other than German composer Hans Zimmer. Instead of using the tracks Apple supplies, you can add your own music — even tracks from Apple Music — but you must download them first. Apple has solved a problem that has long bedeviled users of iMovie and other video apps: getting the length of video and music to end at the same time. In Clips, it happens automatically; no matter how long the clip is, the soundtrack ends when it’s supposed to. I have no idea how Clips accomplishes this bit of magic. Time to Share -- When you’ve finished your opus, sharing it with the world — or at least your friends — is straightforward. Tap the share button to pull up a share sheet, and pick your destinations. These vary depending on which apps and services you use. On my devices, sharing options include video-sharing services (Vimeo, YouTube), social networks (Facebook, Instagram), cloud-storage services (Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive), collaboration services (Slack, Trello), email apps (Gmail, Apple Mail) and messaging services (iMessage, Facebook Messenger). Clips even boasts a facial-recognition feature to identify and suggest friends for iMessage sharing. You can also transfer your video to iMovie for use in a project there. I had good luck with most of my share attempts, but a few (like Instagram) didn’t work at all for reasons that eluded me. For those, I saved the video to my camera roll and uploaded/published from there (using Instagram’s app, for instance). You can also drop a video into iCloud Drive to access it on your Mac. My Creations -- I had a blast with Clips, in spite of its shortcomings. I created a variety of videos in different styles to showcase its capabilities. In my first attempt, I paid homage to a neighborhood gathering that featured homemade pizza and a trampoline for the kids. It was a fun opportunity to use emojis, labels, filters, that TV-style poster, a catchy soundtrack and more. For my next masterpiece, I went the horror route by focusing on a Portuguese man o’ war that washed up on shore in Highland Beach, Florida, and pretending it was a scary monster. This was my chance to use the subtitles feature as I narrated my tale. My music track has a “Jaws”-like vibe. Oscars, here I come. Then I turned my attention to still imagery, creating a series of videos that are basically slideshows – with zooming and panning for a bit of pizzazz. Here is one in Miami, which I also recently visited. I even put Clips to use in my job as a digital producer at the St. Paul Pioneer Press newspaper. The winners of our popular Easter Peeps diorama contest had just been revealed, so I created a catchy promo video featuring some of the colorful entries. The Upshot -- Using Clips was frustrating at times, such as when I could not find what I wanted in the limited selections of filters, labels, posters, and such. Given the vast numbers of such features found in Snapchat and its ilk, Apple’s stinginess is irksome. Sharing failures in certain instances also annoyed me. I also pined for a couple of missing features. Apple Watch compatibility would be nice for, say, being able to hold record on the timepiece while my iOS device is across the room. And while Clips works as well on an iPad as well as on an iPhone, I got frustrated with my iPad Pro when I realized I couldn’t edit Clips videos with the tablet in a landscape orientation and Apple’s Smart Keyboard attached for tweaking animated captions and other text. The app works only in portrait orientation, regardless of the iOS device. But, overall, I love Clips and plan to keep using it. It’s a breeze to slap together video stories, and the app is sure to get better over time.   PDFpen and PDFpenPro 9 add 100+ enhancements to improve your PDF editing experience, with annotations, Tables of Contents, and more export options.

Anytime. Anywhere. NEWS OPS By Raphael Satter. Updated April 26, 2017 9:07AM SHARE ALSO SEE McAfee Security Antivirus Saudi Arabia Government Cyberattack Cybercrime Hackers Researchers at U.S. antivirus firm McAfee say the cyberattacks that have hit Saudi Arabia over the past few months are continuing, revealing new details about an unusually disruptive campaign. Speaking ahead of the blog post's publication Wednesday, McAfee chief scientists Raj Samani said the latest intrusions were very similar, albeit even worse, to the malicious software that wrecked computers at Saudi Arabia's state-run oil company in 2012. "This campaign was a lot bigger," Samani said. "Way larger in terms of the amount of work that needed to be done." It's a striking claim. The 2012 intrusions against Saudi Aramco and Qatari natural gas company RasGas -- data-wiping attacks that wrecked tens of thousands of computers -- were among the most serious cyberattacks ever publicly revealed. At the time, the United States called it "the most destructive attack that the private sector has seen to date." Echoing research done by others, McAfee said the most recent wave of attacks drew heavily on the malicious code used in the 2012 intrusions. McAfee also said that some of the code appears to have been borrowed by a previously known hacking group, Rocket Kitten , and used digital infrastructure also employed in a cyberespionage campaign dubbed OilRig . U.S. cybersecurity firms have tied both to Iran, with greater or lesser degrees of certainty. McAfee stopped short of linking any particular actor to the most recent attacks. Saudi officials and news media have given little detail about the intrusions beyond saying that more than a dozen government agencies and companies were affected, and a government adviser did not immediately return a message seeking comment. The Iranian Embassy in Paris did not immediately return messages. © 2017 Associated Press syndicated under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media. All rights reserved.

Updated April 24, 2017. Ride-hailing app Uber's China ambitions came to a halt in August, when the company ceded its operations in that country to rival Didi Chuxing. But one of Uber's aggressive tactics to win in China nearly cost it some very valuable real estate: a place in the Apple App Store. In a wide-ranging profile of Uber CEO Travis Kalanick yesterday, New York Times writer Mike Isaac reveals Uber had been "fingerprinting" iPhones, reportedly to detect Uber drivers in markets such as China using resold devices to create new rider accounts to boost their ride numbers and incentive earnings. However, by placing code on iPhones that remained even if the devices were wiped for resale, Uber was violating Apple's privacy terms. To prevent Apple engineers from detecting its use of such code, Uber then "geofenced" the region around the Apple's California headquarters, Isaac reported. But Apple engineers beyond that geofenced perimeter eventually spotted Uber's code, leading Apple CEO Tim Cook to call Kalanick in to his office for a face-to-face talk in early 2015. Cook's message: Stop fingerprinting iPhones or risk having Uber kicked out of the Apple App Store. Kalanick agreed to the request. Multiple PR Black Eyes While it's a fast-growing global company valued at close to $70 billion, Uber has yet to turn a profit. In recent months, the firm has also been hit by one scandal after another. In January, a "DeleteUber" campaign launched on Twitter after the company said it would suspend surge pricing for trips to and from New York City's JFK International Airport during widespread protests against President Donald Trump's executive order barring travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries. New York City's taxi alliance had stopped offering airport rides to show support for travelers and protestors. In February, former Uber engineer Susan Fowler wrote a lengthy piece on her personal blog describing a work atmosphere that was hostile to female employees and reluctant to discipline "high-performing" male employees for harassment and inappropriate behavior. Not long afterward, a video recording surfaced showed Kalanick yelling at and arguing with an Uber driver. 'Pressure To Change' These and other Uber practices have caused "extensive" damage to the company, according to yesterday's article in the New York Times. "Mr. Kalanick's leadership is at a precarious point," Isaac wrote. "While Uber is financed by a who's who of investors including Goldman Sachs and Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, Mr. Kalanick controls the majority of the company’s voting shares with a small handful of other close friends, and has stacked Uber's board of directors with many who are invested in his success. Yet board members have concluded that he must change his management style, and are pressuring him to do so." However, TechCrunch reported yesterday that Uber was "pushing back on the allegations" in the New York Times piece by saying its use of fingerprinting is common among tech companies seeking to prevent fraud. "We absolutely do not track individual users or their location if they've deleted the app," an unidentified Uber spokesperson told TechCrunch. "As the New York Times story notes towards the very end, this is a typical way to prevent fraudsters from loading Uber onto a stolen phone, putting in a stolen credit card, taking an expensive ride and then wiping the phone -- over and over again. Similar techniques are also used for detecting and blocking suspicious logins to protect our users' accounts. Being able to recognize known bad actors when they try to get back onto our network is an important security measure for both Uber and our users." The company Slice Intelligence has also been feeling heat in the wake of yesterday's Times story, which reported that Uber had purchased anonymized passenger data about its rival Lyft gathered through Slice's email service Unroll.me. "[I]t was heartbreaking to see that some of our users were upset to learn about how we monetize our free service," Unroll.me CEO and co-founder Jojo Hedaya wrote in a blog post yesterday. "We never, ever release personal data about you. All data is completely anonymous and related to purchases only."

Sony A6500 ProBack Cover snaps on to the iPad Pro to provide protection while featuring a slot along the top to hold the Apple Pencil when not in use. ProBack Cover goes beyond similar cases, however, by routing the Lightning port that charges Apple Pencil from the right side in landscape mode to along the top. This lets you charge Apple Pencil while storing it in the case, and a separate section holds the Pencil cap as well. Apple Pencil charges quickly, of course, so charging on the go isn’t a huge problem. The makers of ProBack Cover do believe the charging method for Apple Pencil through iPad Pro’s bottom Lightning port is problematic in a number of situations, however, so they developed this workaround. Finally, ProBack Cover lets you charge the iPad Pro without removing the case just as you would expect, and they claim audio is rerouted and amplified by playing toward you during use. The back case is also compatible with Apple’s Smart Keyboard which is sold separately. The project is looking to raise $25,000 before May 19 with 197 backers pledging a total of $10,692 so far. Assuming everything works out as planned, ProBack Cover plans to ship in June of this year (although Kickstarter campaigns often vary).

Apple is one of the five companies with the largest overseas cash hoards, according to S&P. Shares of the iPhone maker fell Wednesday afternoon. Evelyn Cheng | @chengevelyn 12 Hours AgoCNBC.com SHARES show chapters Mnuchin: We will make sure wealthy people can't create passthroughs    13 Hours Ago | 02:29 Stocks like Apple with large overseas cash hoards fell Wednesday after Trump's tax plan failed to reveal a specific rate for repatriating overseas profits. Ahead of the Wednesday afternoon announcement, an administration official told Reuters the proposal would include a sharp reduction in the tax rate from the current 35 percent to 10 percent for repatriation of profits — overseas earnings brought back to the U.S. However, the memo from the White House just stated, "one-time tax on trillions of dollars held overseas." Carlos Barria | Reuters U.S. National Economic Director Gary Cohn (L) and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin arrive to unveil the Trump administration's tax reform proposal in the White House briefing room in Washington, U.S, April 26, 2017. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the actual rate has yet to be determined and that the White House is "working with the House and Senate" on a repatriation rate, saying it would be "very competitive." "The market had big expectations. They were expecting a lot of specifics and a specific rate on repatriation and they're not getting it," said Lawrence McDonald, author of "The Bear Traps Report" newsletter. The repatriation tax "is definitely coming, they just don't want to show their whole hand to the Democrats," he said. Apple shares intraday performance (beginning from around noon ET) Source: FactSet Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Cisco and Oracle are the five companies with the largest overseas cash holdings, according to an April 17 note by S&P Global Ratings' Andrew Chang. The iPhone maker's stock erased gains to trade about a third of a percent lower Wednesday afternoon. Shares are up nearly 30 percent since the U.S. presidential election. Microsoft shares also turned negative, trading about 0.1 percent lower. The stock has gained more than 12 percent since the election. Shares of Google parent Alphabet also traded into the red. Shares have climbed more than 9 percent since the election. Technology is the top performer in the S&P 500 for the year so far and the second best performer since the election — financial stocks are still the first. Many on Wall Street have expected that much of any repatriated cash would go towards share buybacks. Back in November, after Trump's election win, Goldman Sachs' chief U.S. equity strategist David Kostin forecast that S&P 500 buybacks would surge by 30 percent this year if there is repatriation, but by just 5 percent without tax reform. Kostin estimated that lower tax rates on repatriated profits should add $150 billion to a total expected $780 billion in buybacks, only the second time in 20 years for which buybacks will account for the largest share of total cash use by S&P 500 companies. Apple has also topped the list of S&P 500 companies with the largest quarterly buybacks and share count reduction in history, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices. — CNBC's John Melloy and Jacob Pramuk contributed to this report.

Wearable Tech by Scott Stein April 26, 2017 10:28 AM PDT @jetscott Overcast on Apple Watch: Podcasts without an iPhone nearby. Scott Stein/CNET I love the Overcast app. It's the best podcast app I've used on the iPhone, and it's better than Apple's Podcasts app. And a few days ago, Overcast added a really fascinating feature for Apple Watch owners: it stores podcasts onto the Apple Watch to listen to away from the iPhone. Turning the Apple Watch into a little podcast repository is a great idea, one that Apple hadn't enabled before. Even the basic task of transferring music isn't easy. The Apple Watch has 8GB of total storage -- less of that is available to the user, though it's enough for a good handful of music -- but getting tracks onto the Apple Watch requires making a playlist and syncing it from within the Apple Watch iPhone app, which isn't instantaneous. In fact, it's usually something I need to let sit overnight. I can't browse Apple Music or my music library and just instantly send things to my Apple Watch. Overcast's app, however, allows this, and it shows what the Apple Watch could be capable of if more apps enabled easy audio file transfers. The new app has a few quirks -- podcasts seemed to stop in the middle sometimes, as if the app has timed out mid-play (which an app update has already addressed), and the app doesn't have its own volume control -- but I was able to listen to "Jordan, Jesse GO!" with just the Apple Watch and AirPods, and it felt oddly liberating. It's fun listening to something with just the watch and my AirPods. AirPods help make the Apple Watch seem like a music product. Their pairing -- and handoff -- between watch and phone is more seamless, and their small size fits the Watch's design. But that simplicity doesn't carry over into the Apple Watch's music handling. The whole idea of a tiny little way to play back music reminds me of what I liked about the old iPod Nano years ago. Yet, two years after the Apple Watch's first debut, the watch doesn't handle stand-alone music as seamlessly as it could. Matt Elliott/CNET How the Apple Watch can be a better music player But, the Apple Watch itself isn't a complete iPod yet, I'd argue. Its music features are at the bottom of a long list of functions. The Apple Watch should have more music storage (at least 16GB). The 2GB available now isn't enough. It should have an easy-access central volume control, like the swipe-up Control Center on iOS. The Apple Watch doesn't have an easy on-the-fly way to control volume outside of the Music app, and weirdly, the AirPods lack volume control, too. Music (or podcasts) should be easily sent to Apple Watch with a tap: either in-app or with iOS' pull-up "share" interface that's often used to send photos, videos, PDFs or other files to other apps. Why not add a "Send to Apple Watch" feature there? Google Play Music has an on-watch download function for Android Wear . Overcast's feature is fun to play with. But it's a reminder that the Apple Watch isn't a killer audio device yet.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Software Apple’s Final Cut Pro X Reaches 2 Million User Mark By Ali Salman 15 hours ago 10Shares Share Tweet Submit Apple has recently announced that it now has two million Final Cut Pro X users. The news comes as the company was speaking to an audience at the National Association of Broadcasters’ annual conference. According to the company, the two million user mark was achieved after more or less five and a half years of releasing version 10 of the video editing tool. Let’s dive in to see some more details on the subject. Final Cut Pro X Hits Two Million User Milestone The company also said that the adoption rate was increasing. Any specific dates were not announced at the conference as the adoption has taken a lot less time to climb from the one million mark to the next. User reactions to the app were not positive initially after the company introduced version 10 of the Final Cut Pro X app. However, the increased adoption rate was imminent after a while. Related Tweetbot For Mac Now Allows You To Send Images Via DM, Usernames No Longer Counts Towards Character Limit The Cupertino giant completely rewrote the professional video editing platform when it introduced version 10. According to Jan Ozer of OnlineVideo ‘Apple was trying to change the workflows of professionals who knew more about video production than any of the engineers who created the product.’ On the contrary, the Hollywood film editor Walter Murch stated ‘I can’t use this’. Advertisement Apart from this, there were several petitions against Apple to call of the new version ans revert it to version 7. In addition to this, selling the business was also coined in the days. The public outbreak of anger and excitement was observed over the new redesigned interface of the platform. Moreover, the removal of so-called core pro features was so popular that Conan O’Brien ridiculed the software on his late night show, Conan. Related Sling TV Cloud DVR Is Now Available On Apple TV Randy Ubillos, the Final Cut Pro creator had predicted the user reaction on the new interface in version 10 of Final Cut Pro X. Henceforth, he suggested that Apple should give users a free copy of version 7 alongside version 10. This would have allowed users to adapt to the new user interface. However, this approach was rejected by Apple. Nonetheless, with Apple’s revisions over the platform and the addition of third-party plugins along with the natural time span, users began to accept the platform. Now, the platform rests alongside Adobe Premiere as one of the leading professional video editing tools on the market. If you’re interested in trying it out for yourself, Final Cut Pro X is available on the Mac App Store for $299. As for now, what are your thoughts on Apple’s professional video editing tool?

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Apple Pay using Touch ID is targeted in new Patent Lawsuit | Main April 26, 2017 Apple has interestingly updated their 'Mac Pro' Trademark to Cover Augmented Reality Displays, Smartglasses and more   At the top of the month we were surprised to learn that Apple was dumping their Mac Pro Circular Tower for an all-new modular desktop design for some time in 2018 or later. According to Phil Schiller, Apple is currently working on their "highest-end, high-throughput desktop system."   To go along with this all new design is Apple's newly filed 'Mac Pro' trademark update. Apple has to legally update their trademark if the 'Mac Pro' is going to support or introduce new components, systems or features not currently covered by their current 'Mac Pro' trademark.   For the record, Apple's 2006 'Mac Pro' Registered Trademark 78885695 only covered the following under International Class 09:   "computers; computer hardware; computer software; computer peripherals; notebook computers; laptop computers; tablet computers; computer servers; handheld computers; mobile computers; hard drives; audio speakers; speakers for computers; personal digital assistants; electronic organizers; electronic notepads; magnetic data carriers; computer gaming machines; microprocessors; memories boards; monitors; displays; keyboards; computer input devices; computer cables; modems; printers; parts and accessories for all the aforesaid goods."   All in all it was just basic coverage.   So what's changed in Apple's latest trademark filing for the Mac Pro? A lot has changed. Anytime Apple floods their international class with a ton of boiler plate filler, you know that their trying to hide something by presenting a confusing soup of possibilities.   Yet some of the entries in their filing definitely stand out, if not scream out, as real possibilities. The most interesting one of all is mentioning 'augmented reality displays," because Apple has a patent for such a device and we know that Apple's Augmented Reality team just keeps growing with all-star engineers. The displays could also be a part of a headset or smartglasses that could be powered by the Mac Pro.   And to bring an Augmented Realty display to market is going to take some serious power and graphics power which is what the new Mac Pro is all about. Additionally, Apple's new GPU will likely be one that they've designed in-house as they're not renewing their contract with Imagination.   Other exciting additions to the Mac Pro trademark are highlighted below.   Apple's April 11, 2017 Mac Pro trademark update in Hong Kong includes International Class 09 verbiage as follows:   "Computers; computer hardware; handheld computers; tablet computers; telecommunications apparatus and instruments; wireless communication devices for the transmission of voice, data, images, audio, video, and multimedia content; network communication apparatus; computer software; computer software for setting up, configuring, operating and controlling computers, computer peripherals, mobile devices, mobile telephones, smartwatches, smartglasses, wearable devices, earphones, headphones, televisions, set top boxes, audio and video players and recorders, home theater systems, and entertainment systems; application development software; computer game software; downloadable pre-recorded audio, video and multimedia content; computer peripheral devices; peripheral devices for computers, mobile telephones, mobile electronic devices, wearable electronic devices, smartwatches, smartglasses, earphones, headphones, televisions, set top boxes, and audio and video players and recorders; biometric identification and authentication apparatus; monitors, display screens, head mounted displays, and headsets for use with computers, smartphones, mobile electronic devices, wearable electronic devices, smart watches, smartglasses, televisions, set top boxes, and audio and video players and recorders; virtual and augmented reality displays, goggles, controllers, and headsets; 3D spectacles; cameras; flashes for cameras; keyboards, mice, mouse pads, printers, disk drives, and hard drives; sound recording and reproducing apparatus; digital audio and video players and recorders; audio speakers; audio amplifiers and receivers; voice recording and voice recognition apparatus; earphones; headphones; microphones; televisions; television receivers and monitors; remote controls for controlling computers, mobile telephones, mobile electronic devices, wearable electronic devices, smartwatches, smartglasses, earphones, headphones, audio and video players and recorders, televisions, set top boxes, speakers, amplifiers, home theatre systems, and entertainment systems; wearable devices for controlling computers, mobile telephones, mobile electronic devices, smart watches, smartglasses, earphones, headphones, audio and video players and recorders, televisions, set top boxes, speakers, amplifiers, home theatre systems, and entertainment systems; data storage apparatus; computer chips; batteries; battery chargers; electrical and electronic connectors, couplers, wires, cables, chargers, docks, docking stations, and adapters for use with computers, mobile telephones, handheld computers, computer peripherals, mobile telephones, mobile electronic devices, wearable electronic devices, smartwatches, smartglasses, earphones, headphones, audio and video players and recorders, televisions, and set top boxes; interactive touchscreens; interfaces for computers, computer screens, mobile telephones, mobile electronic devices, wearable electronic devices, smartwatches, smartglasses, televisions, set top boxes, and audio and video players and recorders; protective films adapted for computer screens, mobile telephone screens, and smartwatch screens; parts and accessories for computers, computer peripherals, mobile telephones, mobile electronic devices, wearable electronic devices, smartwatches, smartglasses, earphones, headphones, audio and video players and recorders, televisions, and set top boxes; covers, bags, cases, sleeves, straps and lanyards for computers, mobile telephones, mobile electronic devices, wearable electronic devices, smartwatches, smartglasses, earphones, headphones, set top boxes, and audio and video players and recorders."   Hong Kong Trademark Filing In-Part for 'Mac Pro'   Phil Schiller revealed Apple's intent to reinvent their Mac Pro on April 4 and by April 11 they were already filing their updated trademark filing for 'Mac Pro' in Hong Kong with some very interesting clues as to what the Mac Pro will support in-part or in whole in the future and over time. Interesting times are ahead for Apple's Pro community, that's for sure.   About Comments: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit comments.

Apps iOS Apps Mac Apps Accessories Tips Jailbreaking Jailbreak Tweaks How to Jailbreak Unlock Devices iPhone iPad Mac Apple Watch Apple TV Deals Latest Deals Chinese ride-hailing service Didi to receive $5B in funding for automated driving expansion Christian Zibreg on April 26, 2017 0 Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi Chuxing is near an agreement to raise $5 billion to $6 billion for automated driving expansion, Bloomberg reported Wednesday. The financing round will lift Didi’s valuation to a cool $50 billion, up from a previous $34 billion after its acquisition of Uber’s China business. It would make the Beijing-based company the country’s top startup by market valuation, even surpassing handset maker Xiaomi, and the most valuable startup in the world after Uber. The four-year-old startup has thus far focused on ride-hailing services in the domestic market, but that’s about to change as it looks to expand into more countries and invest in technologies from autonomous driving to artificial intelligence, as per Bloomberg. From the article: SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son encouraged Didi Chief Executive Officer Cheng Wei to take more capital so he won’t be constrained in pursuing new opportunities, one of the people said. Son made a similar bet two decades ago on China e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., an investment that proved to be his most lucrative ever with a paper profit of $85 billion. The investors entrusted voting rights to Didi’s management, according to one person familiar with the matter. Needless to say, international expansion would put Didi into more direct competition with Google and Uber. Still, Didi may have no other choice but expand across the globe. Since buying Uber’s China business, Didi has faced challenges in the country as major cities, including Beijing and Shanghai, have imposed stricter regulations that have crimped revenue growth. For instance, new regulations require that Didi drivers be local residents. In May 2016, Apple announced a $1 billion investment in Didi, a move that Apple’s boss Tim Cook said would help his company “better understand the critical Chinese market.” Didi called the Apple funding the single largest investment it has ever received. As of last May, Didi dominated the Chinese ride-sharing market, completing more than 11 million rides per day for an 87 percent of the market for private car-hailing in the country. A regulatory filing following the deal revealed that Adrian Perica, Apple’s mergers and acquisitions chief, now represents the Cupertino giant on Didi’s board of directors. Perica played a major role in Apple’s $3 billion Beats acquisition, its largest acquisition to date. The Apple deal was personally disappointing to Uber CEO Travis Kalanick, say people who know him. In March, Didi opened an artificial intelligence lab in Mountain View, California, near Apple’s Cupertino headquarters, to focus on the development of intelligent driving systems. It also staffed the new lab with high-profile names, including famed hacker and former Uber self-driving engineer Charlie Miller, known for remotely hacking into a Jeep Cherokee in 2015, and Jia Zhaoyin, a senior software engineer at Google’s self-driving project Waymo. Didi has amassed data on 300 million users across some 400 cities. Apple is rumored to have about 1,000 engineers working on self-driving software after Project Titan shifted gears to prioritize automated driving software over vehicle development.

Who are you? How much of what makes you “you” is defined by memory? How would you change if you had perfect recall? How might artificial intelligence change the way you relate with yourself, and with the world around you? Siri’s little secret Siri co-creator, Apple’s Tom Gruber set a few of these questions and made a few A.I. predictions when he spoke during the Our Robotic Overlords segment at a TED Conference. We already know that Apple’s vision for A.I. isn’t about machine intelligence for the sake of it, but to augment what we do. We also know it has been using machine intelligence since before it became a popular topic to write about. Gruber explained Apple’s vision as being one in which access to A.I. means humans become superhuman, boosted by superintelligence and enhanced by technological capacity. We can be more with the help of the machines than we can be alone. Assistive for the people “We should not be expected to be super human to use technology,” he writes. “If we design products for everyone -- in situations of impairment -- we will create products that are a joy to use all the time.” He sees the interface as important – to really work it needs to be something we can access in any situation, not matter what else we are doing or our physical condition. Tesla’s Elon Musk has this in mind. He recently launched a company that will augment your mind with a computer, and he thinks this is just five years away.  "For a meaningful partial brain interface, I think we’re roughly four or five years away,” he said. But how is Apple applying these principles of “humanistic A.I.”? Gruber dropped a few clues during his talk. Never forget a face Gruber spoke about how the machines will store our memories. They will remember the faces and names of everyone we happen to meet. They will also remember personal details about our contacts, such as how to pronounce names, family members, favorite sports and more. They will also recall every song we’ve ever heard and every word we’ve ever read. "I believe A.I. will make personal memory enhancement a reality. I think it's inevitable," said Gruber. Apple is already laying the building blocks for this kind of machine intelligence. Face recognition and the Memories features within Sierra’s Photos app show this work in progress. We know Apple is working to put this kind of facial intelligence within its video apps -- the recently-introduced Clips app is already capable of analyzing the visage of people in your clips to identity them, before recommending you share your clip with those people. Communication Advances in mind/machine interfaces, voice recognition and production, analytics and data-based prediction mean these smart machines will become ever more useful as communication tools. Think real-time discussion in multiple languages, communication tools for humans suffering from conditions such as cerebral palsy, and more. Not only this, but as machines evolve, you can also imagine the most physically disadvantaged people being able to make use of smart machines to help get physical tasks done. Getting around Gruber’s vision extends to navigation, which he explicitly mentioned during his TED Conference speech. You don’t have to look too far in the Apple-verse to identify ways in which the company weaves intelligence into Maps. It’s already possible to tap your AirPods and get directions to specific places, or in response to specific requests. A.I. can only make this process easier, predicting tastes and habits and enabling users to get to what they want. Maps matters. Gruber also noted the challenge of working with digital devices while driving. Given all the speculation surrounding Apple’s CarPlay plans for connected vehicles, it makes sense to expect A.I. here. Read Apple doesn’t just want to control your car for more ideas. Healthcare Communication and augmentation are only part of it. Gruber suggested how A.I. can become an assistive technology to help physically impaired people with their lives. Gruber also mentioned use of A.I. in cancer detection. Apple and others are developing new sensors and analytics technology that can only improve the capacity for AI to identify symptoms, manage unhealthy habits, recommend positive lifestyle changes and assist in diagnosis and treatment of common conditions. A major recent study from the American College of Cardiology found that A.I. can accurately predict future heart disease and strokes. That Apple’s AI chief chose to note cancer detection as one of the potential uses of these technologies helps confirm their importance to Apple’s digital health attempts. Personal technology assistants We know Apple is making huge investments to make its Siri assistants much smarter. Last year’s acquisition of Tuplejump was to help the company’s teams, “develop machine learning solutions to power amazingly intelligent user experiences.” Carlos Guestrin, Apple’s director of machine learning said last year: “What’s going to make a major difference in the future, in addition to those things, for me to be emotionally connected to this device, is the intelligence that it has -- how much it understands me, how much it can predict what I need and what I want, and how valuable it is at being a companion to me.” “We have a choice in how we use this powerful tech. We can use it to compete with us or to collaborate with us -- to overcome our limitations and help us do what we want to do, only better,” Gruber said. “Every time a machine gets smarter, we get smarter.” Your relationship with Siri is set to become increasingly personal. Dangerous machine minds There are risks. Not only will A.I. usher in profound societal change and impact jobs, but personal data security will become ever more critical. Gruber says we should be able to control what is and is not recalled by these smart machines. "It's absolutely essential that this be kept very secure,” he said. His thinking matches that of Chris Schreiner, director of syndicated research, UXIP said in a Strategy Analytics press release, who warns: "However, permissions need to be granted by the user to offset concerns about privacy and reduce the feeling of the device being too intrusive. This means identifying the threshold for how much is 'too much' in terms of proactive engagement and recommendations. There is an immediate need for settings on frequency, type of action, and data collected." Cybersecurity pioneer, John McAfee is is alarmed at the negative potential of A.I. Writing in Newsweek, he warns that A.I. will become a self-conscious entity that threatens “the continuation of the human species.” Ethics is another concern. After all, who will decide the ethical perspective used by these smart machines? Will those who do decide what the machines believe to be right and wrong be the CEOs and executive leaders across the world’s big corporations? If so, then you can look forward to your automated planet representing little more than the aspirations and prejudices of the mainly white, mainly male people who lead those firms. If Apple -- or anyone else -- decides the ethics of our smart machines, does that also mean the company will decide what is right and what is wrong? Who gave technology firms the right to make decisions like those, and how can we change them if we disagree with them?

Stratoscale shows you how Video Mingis on Tech: The MacBook Pro show-and-tell I no longer perceive Apple as an innovator. And I no longer believe they are at the top of the heap with respect to creating products their customers crave. I would suggest you can argue that for every product Apple makes, you can find a reasonable facsimile that does the same job. Accordingly, it’s hard to be the top innovating dog when the degrees of separation between Apple and its competition are so slim. Apple lost its focus when it prioritized profit over pleasing its customers. This is nothing new. It happens all the time with companies that become successful -- no matter the industry or sector. Additionally, when you combine the pressures to constantly be the expected leader regarding “state of the art,” there really is no other destination to journey towards than downward. Which leads us to current events for Apple. Steve Wozniak recently predicted Apple, Google and Facebook (not necessarily in order of importance) will still be around and viable in 2075. That’s great. But instead of designing another thing we don’t need any more of, like automobiles (of any kind), I wish Apple would get involved in the science of longevity. This way, Steve Wozniak and I could both appreciate all of the neat stuff available in 2075. But Apple is poised to give us some other stuff we don’t particularly need. Political polls are an extension of market research and studies. We all know how objective and accurate they are. Seriously, the truth of the matter always bring the logical person back to more simple ways of assessing customer needs. For Apple, its professional Mac user base is set to receive a Mac Pro refresh by the end of 2018. It’s not like these few remaining Mac Pro machine folks haven’t already waited long enough or availed themselves of other options existing on the dark side (read: Windows). Apple is also rumored to be coming out with a professional grade iMac. Again, this is something the world, and particularly loyal Apple customers, do not in the slightest, need. Any Apple tech or person who’s taken apart an iMac for repair understands that behind all the sexy sleekness is a ticking time bomb of cumulative, heat-induced repair expense. To put it another way, Apple’s iMac designs stuff ten pounds of components into five pound bags. Since heat is the enemy of computer hardware, it would stand to reason that an informed consumer would understand they (and their iMac) are on the clock in terms of needing repair work, the moment they take that shiny beast out of its box and fire it up (no pun intended). It’s called planned obsolescence. I tire of reading tales of Apple fans who are forced to say goodbye to their iMacs after eight years (or sooner). The sad fact of the matter is that even though Apple is an Intel-based platform, their iMac computers do not last as long as the hardware designs of yesteryear. Which brings us full circle. Hell, even Steve Wozniak can’t do this, if I could get Tim Cook and Jony Ive in a room together, I’d start out by telling them I understand the enormous pressure they are under. I’d also be frank and honest. I would tell them they chose the direction of planned obsolescence for their machines and this fate is entirely on them. By prioritizing profit over the needs of their customers, Apple in essence turned their back on the desires of the base it had when it went by “Apple Computer.” Apple made it clear what customers needed from them was not nearly as important as the Cupertino monolith’s quest to remain among the most cash-heavy multinational corporations in the world. There is no light at the end of tunnel for Apple’s Mac customers. Apple will remain content to give us tidbits like touch bars when we really should be getting the biggest bang for our hard-earned buck. I would suggest looking to the past for supreme computer hardware design. Copycats abound that have sought to imitate Apple. Instead of doing more of the same, Apple has the power, ability and yes, swagger to do something audacious. They can reinvigorate the present by virtue of its glorious past (when it comes to computer hardware design). You’ve read this far. You have an idea, if not a complete understanding, of what my suggestion would be to both Cook and Ive regarding what kind of Mac should be built next. I’ve been told that I have a command for the obvious. If this piece is any indication, you’ll know exactly the hardware case design I’m hinting at: the tower. It’s one that is tried and true. It’s one that should be resurrected. It’s respected and is timeworn, tested architecture. And we need it again. Badly. Why do I feel so strongly about this? That is a discussion for another time.  So until next month, talk amongst yourselves. This article is published as part of the IDG Contributor Network. Want to Join?

Now the limited edition Apple Watch Series 2 has been featured in a Highsnobiety hands-on shoot ahead of its upcoming release. Sony A6500 Just like Apple Watch Nike+, Apple Watch NikeLab is a co-branded Apple Watch Series 2 that includes the perforated Nike Sport band, special Nike watch faces, and has the Nike+ Run Club app pre-installed. Apple Watch NikeLab stands out from the Apple Watch Nike+ collection because of its neutral-tone colored Nike Sport band paired with the space gray Apple Watch hardware. The limited edition NikeLab Sport band includes a custom engraving on the inner pin as well. Apple Watch NikeLab officially launches on April 27 through NikeLab stores, Nike.com, and the Isetan Shinjuku Apple Watch Store in Japan (which will open in about 8 hours as of this writing). Highsnobiety appears to have received a model ahead of time to create these high quality hands-on photos: Previously, the only hands-on photos we’ve seen have been Apple/Nike stock images showing the unique Light Bone/Black Nike Sport band paired with the space gray Apple Watch Series 2. The unique Light Bone/Black Nike Sport band matches the new Nike watch face color introduced through the recent watchOS 3.2 update. Pricing details have not been shared yet, but Apple Watch Nike+ goes for the same 38mm $369 and 42mm $399 cost as Apple Watch Series 2. And even though Apple and Nike recently launched standalone versions of the previously exclusive Nike Sport bands, it’s not likely that we’ll see this color option appear anytime soon. Exactly for how long Apple Watch NikeLab will be available is also unknown at this point, although the limited edition nature of the color combination suggests it may be temporary.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Better Buy: Apple Inc. vs. Google Reviewing the investment thesis behind these two tech titans. Andrew Tonner (TMFTheDude) Apr 26, 2017 at 11:33AM Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) -- the holding company formerly known as Google -- are, in all likelihood, the two most powerful technology companies in the world today. To avoid burying the lede, both companies have outstanding economics and deserve a place as core technology holdings in many investors' portfolios. However, that isn't to say one company doesn't present a more compelling option for investors right now. As such, this article will analyze Alphabet and Apple stocks through three important dimensions to see which company is more deserving of investors' attention in the here and now. Financial fortitude Both Apple and Alphabet are two absurdly profitable companies. With cash positions dwarfing the annual economic output of some pretty large countries, these two companies are financial fortresses in every sense of the word. Here's a quick breakdown of a few of the most commonly used solvency and liquidity metrics for both companies. Company Cash & Investments Debt Cash From Operations Current Ratio Apple $246.1 billion $87.5 billion $65.4 billion 1.2 Alphabet $86.3 billion $3.9 billion $36.0 billion 6.3 Data sources: Apple investor relations, Alphabet investor relations, Yahoo! Finance. Cash from operations reflects most recent 12 months. Most importantly, Alphabet and Apple carry effectively no financial risk. Their respective net-cash positions of $82.4 billion and $158.6 billion alone are larger than most successful companies' total market capitalizations, and this totally overlooks the tens of billions in operating cash flow Apple and Alphabet generate annually. Sure, Alphabet's current ratio trounces that of Apple. However, taken in the context of Apple's broader business. Neither company is at any risk of falling short of its financial commitments. And given that Apple edges Alphabet out in terms of net cash and cash-flow generation, the Mac maker deserves a win in the first category of this analysis. Winner: Apple Image source: Apple.  Durable competitive advantage As alluded to in the introduction, both Apple and Alphabet enjoy considerable durable competitive advantages. For Apple, the company's unique ability to combine beautifully designed hardware with its internal software and app ecosystems allows the consumer electronics giant to command prices far higher than those of its peers. Last year, Apple recorded a $645 average selling price (ASP) for the iPhone, compared to $217 for the average Android handset. This device premium has allowed Apple to consistently capture the overwhelming majority of smartphone industry profits in recent years; one sell-side analyst estimated that Apple earned 92% of all smartphone market profits in Q4 2016. This pricing power is the heart and soul of Apple's competitive advantages, and it seems likely to endure into the company's coming device cycle as Apple launches a totally redesigned iPhone 8 this fall. Alphabet dominates its core internet search business in much the same way that Apple controls the smartphone market. The search giant typically controls two-thirds of the global search market, a feat made all the more impressive by the fact that the Google search engine is blocked and effectively inaccessible in China. According to recent data, Google receives over 30 billion search queries each month across its various platforms. This breadth of exposure and the intent-based nature of Google's searches enabled the Internet giant to command 31% of global online advertising spending last year, and evidence suggests Facebook and Alphabet will continue to capture greater percentages of online ad-spend in the future.  This platform gives Alphabet a massive profit stream that the tech giant has aggressively funneled back into a series of futuristic business ideas it collects in its Other Bets reporting segment. Though they garner significant media attention, Google's only real profit center -- and the source of its massive competitive advantages -- is its search business. Winner: Tie Image source: Google.  Valuation Turning to the third area of this investigation, here's a quick overview of three of the most commonly used valuation metrics as a starting point to frame our discussion. Company P/E Forward P/E EV/EBITDA Apple 16.8  13.7 11.0 Alphabet 30.0  21.3 16.6 Data source: Yahoo! Finance.  Obviously, Apple is cheaper on an absolute basis. However, the key to finding attractive stocks to buy lies in finding relative mispricings between a company's current valuation and its expected future performance. We can do this through a number of ways. One popular metric that tries to capture this is the PEG ratio, which compares companies' growth estimates against their valuations, Alphabet trades at a PEG ratio of 1.3, while Apple is, in theory, slightly more expensive with a PEG ratio of 1.7; a PEG ratio of 1 is, in theory, correctly valued. However, with the average analyst estimating it will grow sales 6% this year, I see Apple's elevated PEG ratio more as a reflection that Wall Street is underestimating Apple's growth potential in the year ahead. Furthermore, Apple's dividend yield and the likelihood that it will increase its capital return program in the coming quarterly report further enhances the company's return profile. This one is tough, but I see Apple as more attractively valued than Alphabet based on my thesis that the market is underestimating the iPhone 8's potential impact. Winner: Apple (by a nose) And the winner is...Apple Hopefully, you sensed that both companies are indeed worthy investments. However, Apple holds a slight edge in today's analysis because of its cheaper relative valuation and its more easily identifiable near-term growth catalyst in the form of the iPhone 8. Still, you can't go wrong holding either tech giant as a part of the core technology stocks in your portfolio for the long term.

clock menu more-arrow Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge Circuit Breaker Smartphone camera shootout: Galaxy S8 vs. iPhone 7, Google Pixel, and LG G6 by Sean O'Kane@sokane1 Apr 26, 2017, 12:10pm EDT share tweet Linkedin The announcement and release of the Samsung Galaxy S8 means it’s time to throw a few more logs on the fire of an always fun debate: which smartphone has the best camera? For years, the answer was the iPhone. But when Samsung shifted to better optics, smoothed out its image processing, the Korean company seriously challenged Apple’s spot on the throne. Then the Google Pixel arrived on the scene, boasting a camera capable of doing what amounts to behind-the-scenes magic with its software. The S8 takes some cues from Google’s software-heavy approach and marries that with great optics and hardware. So we decided to put it up against the other flagship frontrunners: the Pixel, the iPhone 7, and the LG G6. Does Samsung’s newest smartphone camera eclipse the competition in a meaningful way? Each of these smartphones is supremely capable when it comes to mobile photography. So the question I wanted to answer with this test was a little different than just “which one is the best?” (Though I’ll try to answer that.) Rather, since the S8 is the newest, I’m more interested in whether it does anything to eclipse the competition in a meaningful way. Short answer? It doesn’t. Two notes on process — in past comparisons, I’ve kept HDR off to get a better baseline comparison on the JPEG images these phones create. But HDR has become more than just an effect. It’s now, in many ways, integral to how these companies think about photography — what is a short shutter tap for the user is a chance for the sensor to capture and combine all sorts of information. So I left everything on auto, because that output matters more than ever. With that in mind, this piece isn’t going to compare RAW photos. (Sorry!) That’s a useful thing to evaluate at some point, but I was most interested in what kinds of images these phones can capture out of the box. Enough words, let’s see some pictures. — Color Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus Google Pixel XL LG G6 iPhone 7 This set is a good place to start, because it touches on a question I asked myself a lot during my time with these phones, which is: honestly what was the iPhone doing here? The red of the tulips in the iPhone photo is oversaturated, and the darks in this photo are aggressively dark (and a little bit blue). I ran into this problem a few other times with the iPhone, too. Apple’s competition is better at creating photos with sufficient dynamic range and accurate color representation than ever before. In contrast, the iPhone’s take on the idea looks very much like a last-generation camera. At the very least, I don’t prefer it as much as I used to. I think the other photos here are relatively even when it comes to color (and overall exposure), especially compared to the iPhone photo. Samsung washed out the exposure a tiny bit, but the S8 photo is also not quite as warm as Google’s or LG’s and represents the truest color of the scene. Here’s another look at how each phone handled color differently: Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus Google Pixel XL LG G6 iPhone 7 The S8 missed this one pretty badly, pulling in cooler tones from who knows where. Google produced the flattest image with the best detail, but LG’s processing did wonders with the orange color here. I think you could describe the iPhone 7 image as “realistic” if you want to be kind, but it’s a less pleasing image with darker shadows than the rest. Lastly, here’s one I find to be a complete toss-up: Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus Google Pixel XL LG G6 iPhone 7 These are all slightly different takes on the lighting that was available at the time, but I can’t fault any of them for being “wrong” or “bad.” The G6 looks clean and crisp but the light wasn’t really so daylight blue at the time. The Pixel and S8 photos are warm, but the sun was setting. The point here is that these phones can be fooled on color from time to time, but they are all fooled in roughly equivalent amounts. As has been the case in the past, the phone with the best color reproduction might be a matter of personal taste. Detail This is one area that affords more difference. The Pixel and the S8 lead, and together with the G6 they all consistently offer better detail reproduction than the iPhone 7. However the G6, as you’ll see, over-sharpens to the point that it loses some of the fine details it captures. Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus Google Pixel XL LG G6 iPhone 7 The S8 can compete with the Google Pixel when it comes to capturing detail. I can’t say that it eclipses the Pixel, though. Google’s phone regularly captured more detail across the entire frame better than the S8, and both were better than the LG G6. All three of those consistently captured more fine detail than the iPhone 7. These pictures above are an excellent example. While the LG G6 initially popped out to me as “the best,” a closer inspection shows how the G6 is prone to oversharpening its images. That might look fine from a distance, but it means that detail is lost. Check out what the pink flowers look like when zoomed in at 100 percent: The G6 tends to be overly aggressive with fine details, as well as with HDR and overall contrast. There are times when that means you’ll wind up with a photo that needs less tweaking on Instagram, but I’d always rather have the cleaner photo even if it needs a little bit more work. I can always turn the S8 or Pixel photo seen here into the one from LG if I want. Now, the S8 and Pixel are close on detail here, and Samsung’s result might even look more fine than Google’s. But the problem I found with the S8 is that it’s not consistent with this detail throughout the whole image. Take a look at a different part of this same comparison: Here I think the Pixel clearly wins out. It captured subtle detail on the tree trunk and even in the bushes beyond that the S8 missed (and that the LG simulates with its oversharpening). Scroll to the far left side of these images and you’ll see a similar result. And this tends to bear out in the rest of the comparisons you’ll see below. Low Light This is the scenario we often hear the most about from phonemakers, because low-light situations are still a big obstacle — even for full-size cameras. We’ve written in the past about how the Pixel seemed to have a clear advantage in low light thanks to the software trickery it’s capable of. That advantage is still pretty clear in most low-light scenes. Here’s a set of photos that illustrates the point really well: Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus Google Pixel XL LG G6 iPhone 7 The Pixel blows the other three out of the water here, capturing and presenting detail in the shadows without muscling the exposure and introducing a bunch of noise into the photo. The cue ball’s blurred movement is a reminder that success in low light is about more than just being able to capture the light — even with the Pixel’s capabilities, you’re still going to be better off capturing still subjects in dark settings. But the advantage here is clear, and props to the iPhone for finally not producing the worst photo of the bunch. Now, did the Pixel win out every time in low light? Nope: Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus Google Pixel XL LG G6 iPhone 7 For once I wound up deciding between Samsung and LG. The Pixel gets the colors sort of right, but the focus is fuzzy. The G6 and the S8 handled the situation deftly, and both captured good detail despite the poor lighting. The S8 has a bit more detail, but LG balances everything else out a bit better. One last low-light test. This was taken beyond dusk, with essentially just errant street light filling the scene. It’s another good example of how the Pixel isn’t perfect. It also shows that the iPhone can still outperform the competition, even if that seems to be the exception these days, and not the rule. Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus Google Pixel XL LG G6 iPhone 7 The Pixel’s photo is excessively blue, and it also missed the focus. The S8 and G6 might look better zoomed out, but a closer inspection shows the iPhone captured similar detail without adding in a ton of JPEG artifacts. The noise reduction applied by the iPhone smooths out the image without making it look mushy or splotchy, too. Sure, the iPhone photo is a bit dusty and green. iPhone photos still tend to look that way from time to time. It’s a closer representation of the color of the actual scene, and I’d take it over the S8’s version of things. Dynamic range I ’ve mentioned it a few times already so let’s examine some more obvious examples of how the different phones handle dynamic range. Again, since they’re all using similar image sensors of the same size and similar apertures, the differences are more obvious in the way that each camera’s HDR mode handles scenes with difficult and differing lighting. Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus Google Pixel XL LG G6 iPhone 7 Here the Pixel’s HDR — which I once decried was way too aggressive — slaps together more detail in the middle and high tones of the image than any of the others, and it does it without overdoing the “HDR look.” Either I’ve adjusted to it or Google’s scaled HDR back in daylight situations, because this time around I was generally much more pleased with the results. Here’s another late-day scene with even more challenging light. Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus Google Pixel XL LG G6 iPhone 7 The LG G6 comes close to the Pixel here, but the Pixel did just as well handling the bright sky without losing details in the shadows (check out the tree in the bottom left corner). This is also another good example of a situation where the iPhone 7 hung in there, though if you zoom all the way in you’ll see again that it didn’t capture the same level of detail as its competitors. Here’s one last look at dynamic range with a relatively calm image, lighting-wise. Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus Google Pixel XL LG G6 iPhone 7 These are really hard to choose from because of how similarly each phone handled the scene. The iPhone covered the dynamic range about as well as the Pixel and S8 did, revealing details on the gravestone and even in the trees without washing out the sky. But these images also serve as a segue, because my favorite image of this scene was actually taken with a different camera. The Dual Camera advantage LG G6 The iPhone 7 Plus and the LG G6 share an advantage over the S8 and the Pixel, and that’s versatility. After taking the four similar shots above, I realized that the LG G6’s super-wide second camera was able to catch the sun setting over the hill. I was shooting through a fence here, so I wouldn’t have even been able to back away and try to get this shot with the other cameras. It was the super-wide angle lens that made this shot possible. Here’s another example where the G6’s crazy wide angle won me over, compared to the same shot from the Pixel, which was the best of the rest: Google Pixel XL LG G6 Most of the time I kind of despised the G6’s super-wide camera. It is frankly too wide for most settings, and it doesn’t bend the image as pleasingly as, say, a GoPro or any comparable action camera. But it was good enough these few times to illustrate the point that, no matter what Samsung and Google do with their current software, it will be hard to compete with the versatility afforded by more hardware. Apple’s iPhone 7 Plus proves this point even more, as I think its 2x optical zoom is more useful to more people than the G6’s second camera. It doesn’t have image stabilization — which is frustrating on a zoom lens — and the fake blur afforded by Portrait Mode can be hit or miss. But the iPhone 7 Plus’ second lens let me take images that I can’t capture with the S8 or the Pixel. iPhone 7 Plus iPhone 7 Plus iPhone 7 Plus iPhone 7 Plus Selfie camera Samsung improved, but didn’t radically overhaul, the rear camera from the S7 to the S8. It did upgrade the front-facing camera, employing a new image chip that bumps the resolution from 5 to 8 megapixels. That accounts for much more detail and brings it on par with Samsung’s competitors. As for the difference between the four, the S8 and the Pixel capture the most detail, while the Pixel is capable of better dynamic range. LG’s is the lowest resolution, while the iPhone 7 still struggles with a greenish cast. Conclusion The S8 doesn’t have any clear photographic advantage over the Pixel. Maybe it will if it ever finds a way to use Bixby for more than just shopping or AR for more than just face filters. Right now, though, the Pixel simply captures better photos more often than the rest. It produces richer detail across the entire image, and it does this regardless of lighting. I was also pleasantly surprised by the LG G6. I think LG applies more aggressive post-processing to its images than the competition, but it’s not so aggressive that I’d hate the images I was getting out of my G6. What surprised me the most is how the iPhone now feels a generation behind. It was harder to see last year when we pit the iPhone 7 against the Pixel and the less capable S7. But the S8, along with the Pixel and the G6, illuminates the extent to which Apple has fallen behind Google Google engineer shows the spectacular extremes of nighttime mobile photography Mobile Components drive record Samsung profits as mobile sales slide US & World The Pope gave a TED Talk and asked tech companies to do better View all stories in Tech Loading comments...

Credit: Zhang Peng / Getty Images by Dylan Love The Apple rumor mill is spinning like mad this week thanks to some tweets from Latvia. Claiming connections to Apple manufacturer Foxconn, Riga-based Twitter user Benjamin Geskin is showing off what he claims to be a dummy model of the iPhone 8. It’s made out of polished stainless steel, is deep black in color, and has a small “bump” where the camera protrudes from the body. MORE: Everything You Need to Know About the iPhone 8 Geskin’s device is the same size as an iPhone 7, but the edge-to-edge display allows for more screen size within the same hardware dimensions. This adds to speculation the next Apple smartphone would get a big boost on screen real estate.  iPhone 8 Dummy (This is CNC model according to Foxconn) Back is 2.5D Glass.#iPhone8 #iPhoneX #iPhoneEdition pic.twitter.com/Z8mH7b7z4r— Benjamin Geskin (@VenyaGeskin1) April 23, 2017 The device in Geskin’s photos (which he identifies as a CNC mock-up) departs from the popular conception of the current iPhone in two major ways: It implements an edge-to-edge glass screen, and it lacks a home button on the front surface — 9to5Mac suggests the new iPhone will have fingerprint-reading TouchID hidden under the display. Minor adjustments from the iPhone norm include a rear-facing dual-camera system (equipped with a microphone for noise cancellation) and a slightly longer power switch. THIS IS IT. 2017 OLED iPhone. #iPhone8 #iPhoneX #iPhoneEdition Thanks to @ le.pich pic.twitter.com/3NvWU5flDj— Benjamin Geskin (@VenyaGeskin1) April 24, 2017 #iPhone8 #iPhoneX #iPhoneEdition pic.twitter.com/ti61D6Xahm— Benjamin Geskin (@VenyaGeskin1) April 24, 2017 iPhone 8 Motherboard and internal structure.#iPhone8 #iPhoneX #iPhoneEdition pic.twitter.com/PZT8w0AaP3— Benjamin Geskin (@VenyaGeskin1) April 24, 2017 You’ll notice the phone lacks an Apple logo. Our guess: Apple is trying to keep its unreleased phone more discreet-looking, as it seems unlikely that the company would forgo its own branding. Of course, we won’t know anything for sure until Apple actually releases the phone; the company famously doesn’t confirm or deny anything related to gadget leaks. MORE: iPhone Not Charging? There's a (Really) Easy Fix for That If Geskin’s device is real and he’s truly acquired next-generation Apple hardware before any release or announcement, then these tweets constitute the first public glimpse of the new iPhone. We’ll unfortunately have to wait in order to find out. For his part, Geskin maintains confidence that he’s got the real thing. I really hope that after iPhone 8 release, people will remember who leaked it earlier. And will trust my information more.— Benjamin Geskin (@VenyaGeskin1) April 24, 2017 Want More?

The changes combine alterations to the physical space of some stores as well as a new series of events called ‘Today at Apple.’ The 100 largest Apple Stores will be redesigned to include live trees, meeting spaces, and screens similar to the upgrades that Apple’s Union Square store in San Francisco received last year. The Genius Bar will be renamed the Genius Grove in a nod to the addition of trees. Apple Stores will also add a series of educational sessions in 495 locations that will launch at the end of May. The program is called ‘Today at Apple’ and will feature a wide range of presentations and hands-on sessions covering topics like photography, programming, design, art, and music. Sessions will be led by Creative Pros, a new retail store position filled by people with deep domain knowledge in the subjects they teach. In some cities, sessions will also be taught by world-class artists, musicians, and the like. According to Angela Ahrendts, Apple’s senior vice president of retail, the idea behind ‘Today at Apple’ is to serve local communities better: Today at Apple’ is one of the ways we’re evolving our experience to better serve local customers and entrepreneurs. We’re creating a modern-day town square, where everyone is welcome in a space where the best of Apple comes together to connect with one another, discover a new passion, or take their skill to the next level. We think it will be a fun and enlightening experience for everyone who joins. In an interview with CBS News, Ahrendts said: I’ve told the teams, ‘I’ll know we’ve done a really, really great job if the next generation, if Gen Z says, “Meet me at Apple. Did you see what’s going on at Apple today?”’ Ahrendts’ vision of remaking Apple Stores as a sort of town square where people gather is not that far fetched. Apple’s redesigned Union Square store opened not long before WWDC last year. I had conversations with several people that week who felt drawn to the new store and had arranged to meet friends there. Part of the attraction was the new look of the store; only it was more than that. The space was comfortable and a convenient way to catch up with friends, hang out for a while, and decide what to do next.

Share Tweet Share Tags : iOS-iOS+ Apple-Apple+ Articles-Articles+ Wearables-Wearables+ On April 24th, 2015, Apple started shipping its first smartwatch, a brand new device category that the company had been developing for years: the Apple Watch. It's now been two years since the Apple Watch launched, it has undergone one major upgrade with the new Series 2, and it has gone through many software iterations, including a massive speed boost. In the meantime, smartwatches in general have not been quite the hit that manufacturers had hoped them to be. The small start-up Pebble that started it all for smartwatch enthusiasts is now dead because it could not sell enough watches, companies like Fitbit are struggling to stay relevant, the Android Wear platform has to go through some major changes to prove itself worthy and it seems like smartwatches have still not found their raison d'etre. Looking at all this, let's focus our attention on the Apple Watch and what has happened in its two years of existence. First, let's start with a quick timeline of the major events in the 2-year anniversary of the Apple Watch. Apple Watch timeline February 10th, 2013: New York Times and Wall Street Journal report that Apple is beginning to develop an iOS-based smartwatch with a curved screen April 2014: Tim Cook tell The Wall Street Journal that Apple is planning to launch new product categories in 2014 September 9th, 2014: Tim Cook officially unveils Apple iPhone 6 and... Apple Watch, "the next chapter in Apple's story" ***Cook describes the Apple Watch as "a precise timepiece, a new intimate way to communicate from your wrist, and a comprehensive health and fitness device." This 3-in-1 explanation is similar to the way Steve Jobs described the revolutionary new iPhone as a 3-in-1 device: phone, internet connected device and music player. April 10th, 2015: Apple Watch pre-orders start April 24th, 2015: Apple Watch official release date June 4th, 2015: Apple announces plans to stock Apple Watch at its retail stores August 24th, 2015: Best Buy announces it will start selling Apple Watch in its stores by end-September September 9th, 2015: Apple Watch Hermes bands collection announced November 6th, 2015: Apple Watch goes on sale in India and other markets March 21st, 2016: New nylon bands and new color watch bands announced at Apple Event. Apple Sport model price cut by $50 September 7th, 2016: Apple announces Watch Series 2 with water-protection, brighter display, GPS and faster chip inside. Cuts prices on the first generation Apple Watches and upgrades them. Apple Nike watch collaboration announced. September 13th, 2016: watchOS 3, the biggest software update for the platform arrives. It brings a big boost in app loading times, a dedicated Breathe app, a dock with favorite apps, a new Control Center, and more. 1. Is the Apple Watch a success or a failure? Two years after the launch of the Apple Watch, there is still no one opinion on whether it has been a success or a failure for Apple. There are two ways to look at the Apple Watch: firstly, it generates more revenue than any other smartwatch by a long shot, and secondly, it's clearly not a product that generates nearly as much revenue as iPhones and iPads. While Apple does not provide sales numbers for the Watch, Tim Cook has said that the Apple Watch has become the second-biggest watch business by revenue, falling behind only Rolex. Clearly, we have all the evidence to conclude that the Watch is now a multi-billion dollar business that is much bigger than any other smartwatch out there. So it's up to you to choose your viewpoint: choosing to compare with other devices in its class means that you will see the Apple Watch as a success, and choosing to put it in the overall Apple corporate perspective, it's true that the Apple Watch has not become a game-changer like the iPhone or iPad. However, we are not here to crunch numbers, we are here to answer the bigger questions around the Apple Watch: do people need one? What is it used for? What is it not good for? And can it ever become a must-have product like our phones. Let's go ahead and start with... 2. Why do people need a smartwatch? Here is Apple's official answer, in a single picture People need a phone and are used to carrying one with them at all times, but do people need a smartwatch? And what should it do and what should it refrain from doing? Luckily, we don't have to write an essay on this topic: Apple itself has a very telling picture of the Apple Watch front and center on its website. Look at it closer: it's clearly a masterpiece of photography, carefully orchestrated to show the most important, the essential aspects of the watch. Analize it well and you will learn a few important things about what Apple views its Watch as. The choice of a watchface is particularly telling: it shows that the watch is a timepiece, but above all it shows a fitness tracker. Notice that you have the daily rings, the running activity in the top right, and the watch itself in this most representative picture that takes a full screen over at Apple.com is shown in its nylon and sports bands. You can also see a weather app shortcut and a shortcut to the most recent appointment. From this picture, we can see that Apple knows that people use the Watch a lot for tracking their fitness, but also want to check the time, weather and calendar. What is not shown on this picture is notifications, another important aspect of the experience. Apple Watch launched as a 3-in-1 device, but is now more of a fitness wearable with one-glance quick info The Apple Watch and its meaning has changed over the years: the added speed boost has shown that Apple realizes that it is crucial for people to be able to just quickly glance and see information right away, rather than wait for apps to load or to chat on your apps. The digital crown is no longer the watch interface solve-it-all that Apple touted at start. The app drawer consisting of tiny, bubbly icons is rarely shown, as people have found it hard to navigate such small sized icons. The previously advertized feature that you can look on your photos on the watch is basically not promoted anymore. Most importantly, the Apple Watch is no longer advertized as a communications device. That aspect is not completely gone, but for less accentuated. The perception of a smartwatch has changed at Apple, as the company now sees more clearly how real people are using the timepiece. And it has realized that a watch is definitely not for: heavy texting or social media, it's not about games. It has realized that the Watch has to be quicker than a phone, because people would instead just use their phones. It has realized that a $10,000 gold watch is an overkill and that most people buy the $300 sports model. It has realized that while apps are important, they are far less important on a watch than on a phone. 3. What has to improve in future Apple Watches Looking at the competition, it's clear that the Apple Watch has a special place. It is one of very few small smartwatches that also appeal to women. But other smartwatches have also shown that many things could and should improve in Apple's wearable. We now have many Android watches with always-on display that lasts a couple of days, while the Apple Watch only lasts one day without the option to have its screen always awake. We have learned that the digital crown is not that useful and that rival interface mechanisms like the rotating bezel on the Samsung Gear family is now commonly seen as a very viable alternative. Last but not least, we have learned that many people prefer a round smartwatch that more like a traditional timepiece than this rectangular design. And, of course, we have also seen independent smartwatches, that can place and receive a phone call without the need to connect to a phone. Conclusions At the end of the day, the Apple Watch is a popular device that is still trying to find itself. But while in its early days Apple itself seemed confused as to what and how will users use its Watch, these days it has a much clearer idea. And this knowledge will allow it to move quickly and decisively to make the Watch better. We already know that the company is hard at work on bringing full independence to the watch and the new AirPods work as a great combo with the Watch. Is a major Apple Watch overhaul coming, though? Can we expect a round Apple Watch or a rotating bezel? We are a bit skeptical on that front. It's not impossible, but with all credible rumors pointing towards a huge push towards the upcoming Apple augmented reality glasses in 2018, a completely new category of a device, we'd think that Apple's thoughts are going towards that upcoming project rather than to an Apple Watch revolution. Only time can tell, though.

The software is heavy, its not a ROM chip. So considering the services in the background that have to run, its never gonna get a weeks life unless battery tech changes to something where you can get double the battery into such a small space. I don't know any computer that can last a week on a single charge. No phone, no laptop or similar. posted on yesterday, 10:54 1 Reply 9.

However it was using a MCU instead of full fledged processor that you find in a number of smart watches today. Android Wear, Tizen, and now the second gen Apple watches use full fledged processors. The first gen Apple watch only used a single core 400 MHz processor and was really slow and had no wifi. The second gen now uses a dual core processor. However there is still one major problem with Apples smart watch. It's watch face is off for most of its life. You have to press a button tap a screen or do a wrist gesture in order to view the display. With all Android Wear, and Tizen smart watches they have their displays on all the time, with the option to have the display off, and it will turn on like the Apple watch. There is no option to leave the Apple watch display on all the time. That to me is a major flaw with Apples smart watch. posted on yesterday, 10:59 0 Reply 11. marorun (Posts: 4913; Member since: 30 Mar 2015) Sonim XP7 with minimal use ( 5-10 calls a day with 1 email sync ) can hold out 1 full week on a single charge.

Lets just keep the old shyte. If we all live in you all's world, cars, planes, space travel and under water diving would never become a reality because you all would still be walking and beating woman with clubs. No one is making you leave the stoneage. But let us leave it." "Technology progresses. Someone hs to take that initial step and others will follow." http://www.phonearena.com/news/Do-you-have-faith-in-the-future-of-21-display-ratio_id93437 Your statement "Its never gonna happen so...good luck with that." contradicts the way you see technology as quoted by you. posted on yesterday, 11:39 0 Reply 16.

TechieXP1969 (Posts: 13089; Member since: 25 Sep 2013) The Apple Watch was a huge step backwards. Because it only does what someone else did, 2 years before it. Apple doesn't progress technology, they stall it. The only thing Apple did that I truly and honesty do that was right and progressive, was make a phone that made the industry stop dragging their feet and do better. Yes phones were already progressing to that the iPhone was, but if Apple had never made the iPhone, I think we wouldn't have gotten a phone like the iPhone until 2010 or maybe even later. Every other product Apple made prior and since, have all been backwards VS what others had done already. Example...what did the iPod do that we didn't have before? What about Newton, the Mac, Apple Watch and iPad. posted on 48 min ago 0 in response to #13 in response to #13 Hide Reply 33.

I never said it was impossible. I said it won't happen unless the follow8ng happens The software is heavy, its not a ROM chip. So considering the services in the background that have to run, its never gonna get a weeks life unless battery tech changes to something where you can get double the battery into such a small space If you are gonna claim I said something and then claim I contradicted myself, may sure your stupid ads reads everything I said. The exception was, someone qpukd need to improve battery tech to make it happen. Samsung is doing that. But until that happens or someone creates a sustainable energy in such a small package, it isn't gonna happen. I fail to see how what I said today go again what you quoted. It dowsnt5. Some things Re impossible. That doesn't mean we can't move forward. Here is a fact for you. We have a power source that even at the size of a nickel, could likely power a smart watch for years. It's called Nuclear energy. The problem is, you can't be near it. So go find a way to make it safe and you will have a power source that basically almost will never die. posted on yesterday, 10:21 3 Reply 5. TechieXP1969 (Posts: 13089; Member since: 25 Sep 2013) THe Apple Watch is a disgrace. They talked about ut having so many features, and after 2 years of delay, it came out being worse than Samsung's first Gear. There was no rush for this product. They could have delayed it one more year to actually get it right. It has dismal battery-life for a watch that has no cellular or WiFi capabilities. Its just BT. It can't be used as a standalone device. The very things that the original Gear was slaughtered for as cons, the Apple Watch was given a pass for not having. TYPICAL! I want one, but I refuse to pay more for less. Your phone must be with you in order to use it. PERIOD. That' ok for a 1st generation model, but we are on a newer gen and yet nothign has changed. It's no match for the Gear S. The Gear S can be used 100% standalone. You can download apps directly to it without yoru phone. The only plus side to Apple is all the devs support it lie a religion. If the devs support the GEar S like they did Apple, the Apple Watch would be a complete failure. I think devs purposely don't support other platforms because they claim they can't mkae any money. Which is BS. If you make what people want they will buy. There will always be more people who will buy vs steal. That is 100% fact. Its simply a lame excuse. Like the iPhone the Apple Watch is boring. But to be fair, the Gear S3 is boring too, outside of when you use it for what features it offers. BEcause of this, ALL smart-wearables are expensive accessories that don't do anything your phoen doesn't do already. But the Gear has a huge advantage in being able to do SMS texts, phones calls and track your workouts automatically and then sync to your phone when they connect. And both devices can be connected remotely over WiFi and over your cellular connection which means you will never miss a call, or a text...even if it comes to you cell phones number and not your watch number. Apple has the app and support advantage. If Samsung can get devs to support them better, the Apple Watch would die a horrible death. Apple Watch proves that having all the jack in the world, won't automatically give youi a better product. A better product comes from thinking outside the box vs just trying to create another money laundering scheme. posted on yesterday, 11:38 0 Reply 15.

Apple knows its brand popularity will always bring in more money but is that something you can argue with? For Pete's sake, it's not even a bad product and I'm pretty sure it sells more than most smartwatches out there.

After about six months of use, it's become an invaluable part of my daily routine. Quick replying to messages and fitness tracking are probably my biggest day-to-day uses, but the thing that really makes it indispensable is being able to ping my phone, which has a habit of being left in odd places around the house. I do wish the battery life was a bit better, so I could regularly use it for sleep tracking. As it is I could get away with charging it every other night, but I'd still miss out on 50% of the tracking, making the whole thing a bit moot. All told, however, I don't have much to complain about. The fact that it brings so much to the table for just remembering to put it on every morning has made it a more than worthwhile purchase, and it's something I'll be using for a long time to come. posted on yesterday, 11:11 0 Reply 12.

You've got more than a dozen Android manufacturers trying to do new and exciting things every year, but largely those attempts come and go--no matter how awesome they are. A few examples: - The front-facing speakers of HTC's One lineup. Garnered near-universal praise, and with good reason. Some of the highest quality speakers to ever grace a phone, and the design lasted just three generations. - Waterproofing. The Samsung Galaxy S5 touted the fact that it was waterproof, one of the first major phones to be so. Despite the hype, the subsequent two generations neglected to include full waterproofing as one of their bullet points. Samsung finally brought it back with the S8, but only after Apple introduced it on the iPhone 7. - Force touch. Android has had force touch capabilities since November of 2009, with Éclair. Interesting then, that manufacturers only begin including the technology 8 years later after Apple highlights it on their phones. The point of all this being, is it really innovation if nobody cares that you're doing it? "I had a [whatever] before it was cool." Well, yeah, exactly, it wasn't cool when you did it. You didn't make it cool. It took someone else way cooler than you to come along and make it cool. posted on yesterday, 13:28 1 Reply 25. fyah_king (Posts: 875; Member since: 22 Jul 2013) Changed? posted on yesterday, 15:43 1 in response to #24 in response to #24 Hide Reply 27. willard12 (Posts: 1912; Member since: 04 Jul 2012) First, the only thing you are highlighting is how stupid people and gullible people are. Nothing you wrote is any praise for Apple. But, you only highlighted the "bandwagon jumping" that Apple fans do. If a company "makes something cool" to you, then they have also made you a sheep. Or, maybe you're just one of those people waiting to see what Justin Bieber does next so he can "make something cool" for you. 2nd, Samsung cut waterproofing for 1 x generation, not two (the S6/Note 5). The S7 is water resistant as was the Note 7...which were both out before the iphone 7, months before in the case of the S7. But, who cares about facts? This fact alone should make your entire idiotic post null and void...but, let's continue for fun. They also brought back the micro SD card after 1 generation. I suppose you can figure out how to give credit to Apple for that too. 3rd, Force touch still doesn't matter. 4. Large screens, pull down notifications, widgets, LED screens (coming soon), digitizer pens, split screen, one handed mode, wireless charging (coming soon), NFC, power saving mode, 4G LTE that were out months to years before Apple implemented them weren't made cool by Apple. Apple copied and you told yourself it was now cool, because you're a douche. 1 2 Next » view all comments Want to comment? Please login or register.

Faces Production Problems With OLED iPhone 8 Apple's premium iPhone 8 is reportedly proving tough to build as the iDevice maker tries to cram all sorts of bleeding edge technologies into the device. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Apr 26, 2017 at 10:30AM Per a fresh report from Nikkei Asian Review, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) suppliers tasked with producing components for the company's upcoming OLED iPhone 8 "has hit a snag as suppliers struggle to perfect key components including display, wireless charging and printed circuit boards." For example, the report says that Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF), reportedly the sole supplier of the OLED displays on the iPhone 8, "is facing challenges in delivering what Apple wants," with the publication noting that its sources "are unclear as to what exactly the issues are." Image source: Apple. It's not just the displays that are proving problematic, either. The report says that a source within Apple's supply chain says that "Apple and its suppliers are also still working to resolve overheating issues in wireless charging modules." Additionally, the report -- citing work from analyst Sean Kao with IDC -- explains that even the very printed circuit boards found in the device "are running into problems." All this led to analysts quoted in the Nikkei article to speculate that Apple might not get the OLED iPhone 8 into the hands of customers until October or even November. Take your time, Apple It's clear that Apple is packing all the innovative technologies that it can into the new OLED iPhone. That's obviously a good way to drive demand (more innovative products should, logically, be in higher demand than less innovative ones) as well as to try to drive average selling prices up (the more value that customers believe they're getting, the more they're likely willing to pay). Introducing a "premium" iPhone packed with latest tech is clearly the right way to go. KGI Securities analyst, in discussing the potential delay in the production of the OLED iPhone 8, claimed that "if the new features, such as 3D sensing, can provide good user experience, a temporary supply shortfall won't undermine actual demand, which may be deferred to 1H18 [author's note: this means the first-half of 2018]." In other words, if Apple experiences delays in ramping up the supply of its upcoming OLED iPhone 8, it will impact Apple's (and its suppliers') financial results in the near-term (since Apple wouldn't be able to meet demand), but that the demand would just be met in subsequent quarters -- shifting revenue out about a quarter or so.  That would throw off Apple's typical seasonal patterns a bit, but, if Kuo is right, the full-year results would add up to about what they would have been if the supply situation were better earlier on. The one risk, though, is that the longer that it takes for Apple to meet demand, the more time Apple's competitors will have to mount responses and bring more competitive products and technologies to market. That's why it's generally better for Apple to get products out earlier than later and to come as close to supply/demand balance as possible as early as possible. However, it's better for Apple to try to build something truly market-leading and be a little late in delivering products in high volumes than to build uninspiring products that it can easily mass produce but that don't enjoy high demand.  Ashraf Eassa has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Five years ago, the Cupertino company launched a major redesign of the app which temporarily killed many advanced features. Needless to say, the move irked Apple’s pro users some of whom have since switched to Adobe Premiere and other rival apps. Thankfully, Apple has since added back a lot of the missing features via free updates. “It’s a very great pleasure for all of us at Apple today to be able to announce that we’ve now reached two million seats,” Apple’s representative said at the event, adding they’ve been able to get much faster from one million to two million seats than from zero to one million. At any rate, it’s encouraging that the pace of adoption has been increasing. Apple in years past used the NAB event to announce major new versions of Final Cut Pro. Back in 1998, it even demonstrated an early alpha build of the software to cherry-picked industry figures in a private room at the event. Final Cut Pro X is $299.99 on Mac App Store. A free 30-day trial can be downloaded from Apple’s website. The app requires a Mac with a 64-bit Intel chip, macOS 10.11.4 or later, 4GB of RAM (8GB recommended for 4K editing and 3D titles) and an OpenCL-capable graphics card or Intel HD Graphics 3000 or later.

The cuts apply to all apps and in-app content, Apple said. However, they do not apply to commissions for movies, music, books and TV, which will remain at 7 percent. The company will continue to pay commissions on Apple Music memberships as well. Apple directed affiliates to read the Commissions and Payments page on its Affiliates Resources site for more information on the new policy. Big Cut, Short Notice Both the extent of the cuts and the brief notice provided -- they go into effect next week -- are surprising, and have given rise to speculation that the policy change may be part of a larger shift in Apple's recent revenue picture. "It is interesting that they've kept the 7 percent intact for higher-value digital content," said John Jackson, research vice president at IDC. "The connection is not terribly clear, but presumably Apple wants to drive more revenue from subscriptions and higher-value content in general, so this may be a move to bias affiliate-driven traffic in those directions," he told the E-Commerce Times. Apple Senior Vice President Phil Schiller last year revealed plans to shift toward a new subscription model for developers. The plan centered around changing the 70/30 revenue share model to favor developers who attracted subscribers. If a customer remained a subscriber for a year, Apple would slash its 30 percent share to 15 percent, thus boosting the developer's take. It's been rumored that Apple plans to announce the share model change this June at its 28th annual Worldwide Developers Conference. Apple did not respond to our request to comment for this story. Digital Content Push During Apple's fiscal first quarter conference call, executives noted the shift toward services as the core piece of the company's growth. They also noted that the App Store was shattering records. Year-over-year revenue growth was up 43 percent, and revenue more than doubled that of Google Play during the 2016 calendar year, said Apple CFO Luca Maestri. "As disappointed as affiliates will be with the news, the move makes sense from Apple's perspective," said Karol Severin, an analyst at Midia Research. "Apple is managing incentives for affiliates based on what it wants to push," he told the E-Commerce Times. The affiliate program's initial purpose was to get the App Store off the ground, Severin said, but now it is Apple's best-performing content play. Developers will not feel any direct impact from the new policy, which does seem driven by the shift toward a subscription model, suggested Jack Kent, director of operators and mobile media at IHS. "The move will have a much bigger impact on third-party review sites and aggregators that have used the referral program to drive incremental sales," he told the E-Commerce Times. "In the early days of the App Store, these sites would have helped drive traffic, but now the market is more mature, and so these will have less of an impact on the overall app market."

By Liam Tung for Null Pointer | April 26, 2017 -- 13:38 GMT (06:38 PDT) | Topic: CXO The new Today at Apple sessions are meant to help customers learn new skills and aid professionals hone their expertise. Image: Apple Apple will soon launch a range of educational sessions at 495 stores covering coding, media, and art and design to help people get more from their Apple hardware. The new sessions, dubbed Today at Apple, aim to convert Apple's stores into a "modern-day town square", according to Apple retail boss Angela Ahrendts. Trained Apple staff and in some cities "world-class artists, photographers and musicians" will help customers learn new crafts and aid professionals hone existing skills. Apple says 60 different programs will be launched at the end of May at all 495 Apple stores worldwide. There will also be a Business Circuits program in select stores to connect small business owners with entrepreneurs. On weekends, Apple will offer a Kids Hour session, featuring lessons in music making and coding with robots, while teachers are invited to join Teach Tuesday to learn how to use tech in the classroom or help young coders learn Apple's Swift language. In an interview with CBS News, Ahrendts said the Today At Apple program was the "software" component of a global Apple store "hardware update", which will introduce new screens and spaces for meetings and classes. Apple will also introduce new seating, sounds, wall displays for products, and mobile screens created by Apple designers for the educational sessions. Ahrendts references Apple's other design updates, such as the new Genius Grove at the San Francisco store, a tree-lined version of the Genius Bar. She said the goal is for Apple stores to become a social gathering spot like Starbucks. She's told Apple teams, "I'll know we've done a really, really great job if the next generation, if Gen Z says, 'Meet me at Apple. Did you see what's going on at Apple today?'." She looks at Today at Apple as a way to build for Apple's retail business the services that Apple has for its online platforms. Key sessions include Photo Walks. which will help participants capture action on video, while Sketch walks will focus on drawings, watercolor, and brush techniques. The Kids Hour will include coding with Sphero robots, and using GarageBand and iMovies. It will also offer an introduction to coding via the Swift Playgrounds iPad app. Others include a Photo Labs session, Music Labs, an editing-focused Pro Series, and sessions for people who want to learn from musicians and artists.

Close Apple self-driving car plans emerge: how will it play with automakers? John Voelcker Apr 26, 2017 Follow John Add to circle Liviu Tudoran's "Apple iMove" design studyEnlarge Photo Last year, techies, auto journalists, and Apple fans spent a great deal of time debating the existence, technology, and potential prospects of an "Apple car" project that the company never officially acknowledged. The idea that Apple would move from fast-turn, high-volume, very profitable consumer electronics into long-cycle, insanely expensive carmaking never really made a lot of sense. And in the fall, it appeared that the "Apple car" project had died. DON'T MISS: Apple Car always faced insanely great odds, now apparently dead (Oct 2016) The secretive Silicon Valley company, however, hadn't stopped its research altogether—and now some further information has emerged on its ongoing investigations into self-driving car technology. According to a report by the Reuters news service this past weekend, the company received a permit earlier this month from the California Department of Motor Vehicles to test self-driving cars on the state's roads. It will now be required to report to the state on the progress of its self-driving car efforts, potentially opening its secretive "Project Titan" to more public scrutiny. Google Self-Driving Car PrototypeEnlarge Photo The California DMV had released documents associated with Apple's application that were supposed to have the names of its "driver/operators" redacted. They were not, however, and appear to include the names of former Tesla employees, NASA veterans, and robotics experts, according to a report by Business Insider. The application documents filed with California include contingency plans for "operators" riding in the self-driving prototypes to assume control of the cars if needed. READ THIS: Maybe Apple and Google won't take over the car industry after all? The cars to be operated on California roads are Lexus RX450h plug-in hybrid crossover utility vehicles. They have been fitted, it appears, with additional Apple-developed software for self-driving, including the ability to "capture and store relevant data" from operations—including any events leading up to a collision. Nothing in the documents gives a clue one way or the other as to whether Apple is contemplating building its own cars or creating software it could provide to existing automakers. iOS 10.3 Apple CarPlayEnlarge Photo Once the initial flush of excitement over the possibility of an "Apple car" abated, more rational minds pointed out that it takes decades to become a globally competitive automaker, not to mention tens of billions of dollars. While Tesla is often cited as the model for new makers, the company has yet to turn a profit after 12 years (save for two marginally profitable quarters) and its future independence as an automaker remains open to question. Apple certainly has cash to spend, but the highest and best uses of that hoard may not be in entering automaking. CHECK OUT: Chevy Bolt EV electric car shows GM can do Silicon Valley, exec says Instead, it more likely sees itself competing with Google to "own the dashboards" of future vehicles—with the now-ubiquitous Apple CarPlay and Android Auto just the first step. Self-driving car programs are under development at virtually every major global auto company, including BMW, Daimler, Ford, General Motors, Hyundai-Kia, Tesla, Toyota, and Volkswagen Group. Silicon Valley companies in that same sphere include not only Apple and Google but also Uber and Lyft, part-owned by General Motors, which bought the Cruise Automation startup last year. Tesla Model S Autopilot systemEnlarge Photo Google's Waymo unit, meanwhile, has covered more than 2.5 million miles of testing on public roads. Tesla, meanwhile, has aggregated operating data two orders of magnitude greater from the travels of its electric Model S and Model X. _______________________________________ Follow GreenCarReports on Facebook and Twitter.

TrustedReviews Facebook Twitter Googleplus TVs & Audio Cameras Computing Mobile Home appliances Gaming Huawei Competitions GPS & Sat Nav Mobile Apps Mobile Phone Accessories Mobile Phones Tablets Wearables & Fitness Trending: Nintendo Switch Nokia 3310 iPhone 7 Galaxy S8 LG G6 iPhone 8 Home / News / Fitness News / Apple Watch Series 3 tipped to arrive with new display technology Apple Watch Series 3 tipped to arrive with new display technology by Joe Roberts 17 hours ago 0 shares Read Comments Apple is expected to launch the Apple Watch series 3 either late this year or early in 2018, and it seems the device could come packing new display technology. A new report from Business Korea claims Apple is working on producing its own micro-LED tech – something it's reportedly been working on with LuxVue, a firm acquired by Apple in 2014, for two years. The technology is expected to replace OLED displays in the Apple Watch, and, according to a recent patent filing, could allow for in-display fingerprint scanning when combined with infrared diodes. Related: iPhone 8 As such, according to the report, Apple could eventually move to use the technology on its iPhones, which makes sense following reports that the company is having trouble developing an in-display Touch ID component for the iPhone 8. Samsung Display and LG Display, two of the companies that currently supply panels for Apple's phones, with the latter also supplying screens for the Apple Watch, are set to be significantly affected if that turns out to be the case. The report claims micro-LED panels are thinner and lighter than OLED technology, though at this point, Apple is not at a stage where it can develop large enough panels to use in iPhones. Micro-LED tech could also make its way onto future iPhones Micro-LED, also known as microscale LEDs or µ-ILEDs, gained some attention in the summer of 2015, though at this point the technology remains somewhat mysterious. Other than those that have worked on its development, very few know much about how it works. But as AppleInsider reports, Ken Werner of Display Daily previously called it "the only potentially disruptive technology" in an industry trade show. Back in January, China’s Economic Daily News reported that Apple was eyeing a third quarter 2017 launch for the Apple Watch 3, but that remains unconfirmed at this point. Business Korea's new report also claims Apple is likely to switch display suppliers for iPhones from Samsung to a Chinese firm, with both Samsung and LG said to be concerned Apple will start using RAM and cameras from other companies, too. News of micro-LED tech going into production follows Apple's move to start developing its own graphics chip, after parting ways with British chip-maker Imagination Technologies, which makes GPUs for the iPhone range. The company is also said to be working on developing its own battery power-saving technology, and already makes its own CPUs which are currently in use in iPhone and iPad models. Developing its own screen tech would allow the company to become even more independent, not relying on components from the likes of LG and Samsung in the future. At this point, it remains unconfirmed whether micro-LED tech will indeed make it into the next Apple Watch, but stay tuned for more in the coming months.

ITProPortal Search RSS News Features Analysis Guides Reviews Categories Business Hardware Security Software Mobile Enterprise Cloud Networks Public Sector Startups Web App store optimisation 101 By Andrew Green Feature  In the highly competitive app-economy it is essential that your app is optimised correctly for its intended platform. Shares  Andrew Green, UK director at Applause, the leader in professional crowdtesting, outlines his best practice tips on how to get your app the attention it deserves. The app-economy competition is fierce. Facebook owns four out of the five most downloaded apps worldwide, but startups are still leaping into the fight to claim new and old markets. For these startups, Facebook is often the least of their worries as, according to research from Gartner, we only actually use between six and ten apps on average and end up neglecting or deleting the rest. It’s tough for app developers to break through the noise, let alone get into that top ten.    So what does this mean for startups trying to break into the space? You have to put your best foot forward to make sure users will not only find your app, but keep it.      Just as we have SEO for the web, ASO (app store optimisation) for the app store has become an essential part of the app development process. In basic terms, ASO is a set of guidelines to optimise the discoverability of an app via Apple’s App Store and Google Play. From keywords to descriptions to icons, I’ll run through some best practice tips for ensuring your app can be found in the ever-expanding ‘app-mosphere.’  Check the guidelines on Apple and Google  Apple is very stringent about its App Store guidelines, and they have human editors that review all submissions of new apps and updates to existing apps. Google Play’s review process uses a mix of automated and human editors and although their policy is a bit more lenient, there are practices that must be followed to pass the submission test. So before you even submit your app, let alone worry about optimisation, make sure you are complying with these guidelines:  Apple Apple marketing guidelines – how to use Apple names and logos App Store human interface guidelines – how to design for iOS App Store review guidelines Google Google Play Developer Policy Center – descriptions on restricted content, security and privacy Android app launch checklist – details on everything from setting up a developer account to testing and best practices Best practices for discovery on Google Play It’s all in the name  Yes, what you call your app is important. Both Apple and Google recommend titling apps to be as specific to the function of the app as possible – apps that mislead consumers may be rejected, and of course the more specific your title is, the better the chances that your prospective customers will be able to find you.  Your title needs to be short and snappy. Apple’s App Store has a 50-character limit, while Google Play cuts it down to 30. This means that you need to ensure your title contains the right words within the right number of characters. And while the goal is to present your app as unique and creative, this can be difficult when you also need to include the popular keywords to get noticed.    Make your description concise  Your app’s description is also hugely important. This mustn’t contain flowery, over-descriptive language about your company, but keywords and concise information about exactly what the app does for its users.    Google Play offers two app description fields: long and short. The short description is what the user sees on the download splash screen: a pithy 80-character sentence. The long description can be up to 4,000 characters: this is your chance to introduce your brand, key features, and contact information. When you’re writing a description for Apple, however, you don’t have as much space, so keep it to exactly what the app does.  Beware of getting lost in the swamp of highly competitive keywords.  High traffic keywords means high competition, so make sure you thoughtfully use keywords that are unique to your app as well as popular.    Most importantly, include screenshots (at least three) and a video to really make your app stand out. These should mirror the app description but in picture/video form.    Your icon  A picture can speak a thousand words, and as the first impression (displayed in the app tray on your mobile), your app icon better speak positively about your brand. Moreover if people have your app on their home screen, the icon is a daily reminder of your brand.    My advice: create something simple and eye-catching, which works from a 50-by-50 up to 250-by-250 pixel basis for both Apple and Google Play.  Localise your app   English may be the universal language of the Internet, but it’s proven that translated apps for their respective regional audiences will get more downloads than English-only apps. This is particularly important on Google Play, which has more app users from around the globe.  But remember, translation is only part of localisation. Whether it’s colloquialisms, symbols, or how people use mobile phones across the globe – there are many cultural differences that you need to keep in mind beyond translations.    Get it right the first time  You have one shot to impact and impress consumers. Market research suggests that first impressions are crucial in the app store - according to mobile marketing and analytics firm Localytics, 23% of people will only open an app once after downloading it. The firm also notes that, after a few months, the average app retention rate is 20%, so four out of five of your potential consumers could disappear in one quarter. Therefore, above all, it’s important to measure the impact and effectiveness of your app with target users before you launch to ensure that it’s optimised from the start.    You can’t wait for the second or third release to get these steps right. When you are building an app that you want people to love, ASO is a crucial first step to getting it seen by your target consumers. This is of course followed by the equally important user experience for when they do click the ‘download’ button on your app, especially as consumers have become increasingly ruthless when it comes to selecting their favourite few. Get both right, and you should be on your way to achieving the ultimate goal of delivering an app that makes it to the homepage, and stays there.  Image Credit: FirmBee / Pixabay Topics apps software mobile startups Security crowdtesting apple app store google play GET YOUR FREE MAGAZINE NET: The Money Issue worth £5.99 Join over 7000 ITProPortal subscribers!

Home Macs | 20 Apr 2017 | Listen  | Print  | Comment (16) iLife and iWork Apps Now Free for Everyone by Josh Centers Once upon a time, Apple used to charge for nearly all its software, and especially productivity apps like the iLife and iWork suites. However, back in 2013, Apple made those apps free with the purchase of any new Mac or iOS device (see “New Free iLife and iWork Apps Share across Devices and Platforms,” 22 October 2013). Now, with no announcement or fanfare, Apple has made the current iLife and iWork apps entirely free for all users. Just to be clear, the change affects the following apps: GarageBand for macOS (requires 10.10 Yosemite) and iOS (requires iOS 10.2) iMovie for macOS (requires 10.11.2 El Capitan) and iOS (requires iOS 9.3) Keynote for macOS (requires 10.12 Sierra) and iOS (requires iOS 10) Numbers for macOS (requires 10.12 Sierra) and iOS (requires iOS 10) Pages for macOS (requires 10.12 Sierra) and iOS (requires iOS 10) This is good news for holdouts who haven’t purchased a new eligible Apple device since 2013 but are running a supported version of the operating system and would like copies of the iLife and iWork apps. And it makes explaining the pricing easier for Apple. Why didn’t Apple just make these apps free for everyone in the first place? The answer likely lies deep within Apple’s accounting department. Back in 2013, Apple made iLife, iWork, and OS X 10.9 Mavericks free and bundled them with every new Mac and iOS device sold. That move enabled the company to delay recognition of a portion of its sales receipts. That’s because the product (a Mac or iOS device) wasn’t “fully delivered” without updates to the software — it’s a “subscription accounting” approach. In its Q4 2013 financial quarter, Apple delayed recognition of $900 million in revenue, in essence hiding that money from the quarterly report (see “Apple Q4 2013 Results See Lower Profits Again,” 28 October 2013). That may answer the question of why Apple is now making these apps free for everyone. According to Daniel Eran Dilger of AppleInsider, the deferred revenue trickles back into Apple’s reported revenues over 2 years for iOS and 4 years for the Mac. It has been about 4 years since this deferral likely began, implying that Apple has finally cleaned the associated deferred revenue off its books. In the end, this change doesn’t mean much. Any effects from iLife and iWork becoming free — on competing apps, on Apple’s revenues, and on the perceived value of Apple hardware, for instance — have already taken place. Most people who want to use the iLife and iWork apps have likely either bought copies already or purchased new hardware since October 2013. We suspect that sales to owners of older Macs and iOS devices have dropped to the point where it was no longer worthwhile for Apple to bother charging for the apps anymore.

Receive comments via RSS Add a comment Alfonso Scenna  2017-04-20 15:51 For people with older iOS devices, unless you are able to run iOS 10 you cannot download the now free apps. Reply Jim Schmidt  2017-04-24 12:32 Yep, I found that out last night. I went to download Pages on my iPad, and found out I couldn't because I don't have iOS 10 on it. I went to upgrade the OS... and found out my iPad is too old for 10. Sad. Reply Ian Orchard  2017-04-24 20:08 I've got the same problem with my beloved MacBookPro that is now deemed to be obsolete by Apple. I can't upgrade my current copies of iWork because it can't run Sierra. Now if only I could find a way to stop Pages & Numbers from nagging me to upgrade. Reply Jeffrey Puritz  2017-04-20 17:33 You're an optimist but my lengthy experience with Apple tells me that like Aperture these apps are in for a long slow death by neglect. Sadly, I think that this is true for the mac as well. Apple is only interested in the products with the most revenue and it shows. Reply William C Roberts  2017-04-25 09:27 I agree about "death from neglect". When apps become free, it means the developer, Apple, is no longer going to improve them. Eventually Apple will stop supporting them. Ultimately the apps will stop working. Reply Adam Engst   2017-04-25 09:49 But you have to remember that the entire point of making these apps — and the operating systems! — free was to add value to the hardware. Apple has never made significant money on software; the lion's share of the revenue has always come from hardware. As long as the software encourages hardware sales in a real way, it will keep getting attention. And, in fact, Aperture shows that charging money for an app makes no difference to Apple. My guess is that Apple will keep these apps going for a long time, but that users shouldn't expect the pace of development or innovation to compete with hungrier independent developers. Reply B. Jefferson Le Blanc  2017-04-26 09:48 Actually your pessimism about the Mac no longer seems justified. For one thing, Apple's laptop line got an "upgrade" recently. And current reports indicate a Mac Pro upgrade can be expected next year, with a return to an "expandable" configuration. In a rare bit of candor Apple admitted that the "trash can" Mac Pro was a mistake. It's cute but turned out to be a technological dead end. There have been hints that the iMac is also in for a refresh, though how fresh that will be remains to be seen. Competition for the iMac from the Microsoft Surface Studio will be heating up in the not-to-distant future. Given that Apple claims not to be interested in a touch screen Mac, it's hard to see how their response to the Surface Studio will be anything but underwhelming. The touch-bar on the MacBook Pro is little more than a toy and would be ergonomically inappropriate on a desktop computer. Sadly there's no news about the Mac mini. The mini may have the same problem the Mac Pro has: Thermal issues limit the amount of new hardware that can be included in the mini's diminutive box. But then the Mac mini was never intended to be a performance machine. Instead, it's a small office work horse. That is unlikely to change substantially. That said, I agree with Adam that free iLife and iWork software is not bad news. And they will encourage adoption of Sierra on hardware that can support it. If your hardware is obsolete, well, to coin a phrase, that's not Apple's problem. Indeed, iLife and iWork upgrades have been platform specific for some time now. In any case, older versions of those apps may be better in some ways than the new kids on the block. New versions have tended to lose rather than gain features, a well established Apple hallmark. Reply Frans Moquette  2017-04-20 18:15 Free may seem like a good thing, but nothing is really free. In this case we will be paying for these apps through hardware purchases, if we use an app or not. Then there is the question of app quality. Since Apple is not making any money off them anymore there is no stimulus to make these apps so good people will be willing to pay for them. The option to vote with our wallet has been taken from us. One sad example is the latest version of Numbers for iOS. The complaints and 1 star reviews are pouring in but Apple seems to be deaf and blind to them. Now that Numbers is free there is even less reason te expect Apple to do anything about this bad update. Reply Paul F Henegan   2017-04-21 03:55 No, they are not "free for everyone", only for those who have also upgraded to macOS X 12 or later. As Alfonso Scenna observes above, unless one is willing and able to run the very latest OS, there is no invitation to the party. Reply Adam Engst   2017-04-21 09:39 You're right that these apps have specific system requirements, and we've updated the article to make this completely clear. However, that doesn't change the fact that the apps are indeed free for everyone. Your ability to run an app is separate from its price. Reply Karen Kirtland  2017-04-24 19:55 The upgraded 5.2 version of Pages I tried using was terrible when compared with the older 4.0 versions. It functions too much like the awful Word program for me to use it. I wouldn't upgrade any of my perfectly functioning iWork programs, free or not, based on the extremely negative experience with Pages alone. Reply Phil Seymour  2017-04-24 21:15 They are free because the latest versions are crap compared to 09 versions. Thankfully I have kept the older versions of Pages, Keynote, Numbers, iMovie, GarageBand and iPhoto. I have the new versions, too, but if I have creative work to do, I use the older versions that were designed with uninterrupted creative workflow in mind. Reply Andrew Daws  2017-04-25 03:09 Anyone know how to get the iLife 11 version of iPhoto? I need it to open an old library Reply Jolin Warren  2017-04-25 07:14 There seem to be old copies available on eBay. You could possibly pick up a used one for a couple of dollars. http://www.ebay.co.uk/bhp/ilife-11 I also might have an old copy which I don't need anymore, but would have to check when I get home. Email me at tbcomment.2017.jolinwarren@xoxy.net if interested! Reply Jan van Es  2017-04-25 03:11 But what about people that are unable or unwilling to install the latest versions of MacOS? I cannot find any option to download (or buy) an older version of apps like Keynote, Pages, Numbers, etc. (Nor can I find any info about which version of those apps is compatible with which version of MacOS.) Reply Adam Engst   2017-04-25 09:44 There is a fair amount of information on Wikipedia about the versions. For instance: about Keynote: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keynote_(presentation_software As much as it would be nice if Apple gave all old stuff away for free, or even kept old versions available for sale, I presume they've done the math and determined that it would be a significant expense that would benefit very few people because those who don't upgrade to new hardware tend not to buy (or even download) new software either. One of the basic corollaries of sticking with old hardware is that you shouldn't assume it will ever do things beyond what it could do when it stopped being supported. Macs stay functional for a long time, which is great, but they won't gain new capabilities (via new software) after a certain point, and they will start to lose functionality (through lack of compatibility with current software) after that.

(Free Report) Home | Companies Tags: Amazon | Apple | Google | Digital | Gatekeeper Amazon Takes On Apple and Google as Digital Gatekeeper Getty/LeonNeal By Shira Ovide   |   Wednesday, 26 Apr 2017 09:11 AM Close  More ways to share... Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    A recurring theme at Gadfly is Amazon.com Inc.'s ambitions to do everything under the sun. It looks as if the company now wants to become a quasi app store similar to Apple or Google's mobile versions. Amazon on Monday created a single spot for people to sign up to digital subscriptions from companies including the Los Angeles Times and digital file cabinet Dropbox. For the hundreds of millions of customers who have Amazon accounts tied to their credit cards, it's easier to buy from Amazon than handing over their personal information multiple times to sign up individually for Dropbox, the New Yorker and SlingTV.  Amazon has previously sold subscriptions such as these, but this is first time it has packaged them in one place for customers to browse and purchase. If what Amazon is doing sounds a lot like Apple's App Store or Google's Play Store for Android phones, you are correct.  For now, Amazon's new digital subscription storefront is a pipsqueak. Amazon announces new products or services all the time that don't go anywhere. But the potential is intriguing. The app stores from Apple and Google are hugely powerful gatekeepers for sales of online music, newspapers and magazines, digital video packages, food delivery subscriptions and software. If you're a company that offers a digital service -- particularly ones like Spotify or newspapers that are commonly accessed on smartphones -- Apple and Google call the shots that influence your business and stand between your success and failure. Amazon is giving companies an alternative to distributing their digital subscriptions without relying on the storefronts controlled by Apple and Google. The new service is part of a trend at Amazon that isn't broadly understood. Of course everyone knows Amazon is the supreme gatekeeper for products. If your shoes or headphones aren't sold on Amazon, they don't exist in the minds of many shoppers. More quietly, Amazon has also become an influential storefront for non-physical things, too, like software subscriptions and online TV services.  And indeed, the new digital subscription storefront mimics one Amazon started in 2015 for online video subscription services like Starz and Seeso, a comedy-focused Web video service. Entertainment companies were initially skeptical about Amazon's motives but changed their minds. For some digital video channels, Amazon quickly became the single largest seller of their subscriptions, according to a report last fall in tech news outlet The Information.  For companies that aren't well known -- and even ones that are -- selling subscriptions is a grind. They have to splurge on ads to get noticed, try free marketing tricks or hope that Google or Apple decide to feature them in the highly visible home pages of their app stores. Subscription services can easily get lost in the cacophony of Amazon, too, but the company can also suggest that customers who buy a book of New Yorker cartoons also purchase a digital subscription to the magazine. Amazon is good at selling subscriptions to its own Prime shopping club, which analysts estimate has 60 million to 70 million members, and it could bring that expertise to bear to sell outsiders' subscriptions, too.  The real intrigue is whether Amazon would change the rules of the distribution game if it can join Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc's Google as the gatekeepers for all sorts of digital goods. For companies that opt to sell digital subscriptions through Amazon, it is offering similar revenue sharing as Apple's recently revised business terms for companies that sell digital services. For a customer's first year as a subscriber, the owners of a digital subscription keeps 70 percent of the revenue and gives 30 percent to Amazon. After the first year, the company's cut goes up to 85 cents of every dollar from the subscription fee. Amazon's Initial Share of Digital Subscription Revenue: 30% But what if Amazon decided to take an even smaller share of revenue from subscriptions, or none at all? Presumably that would put pressure on Apple and Google to follow suit. Companies have complained for years that they are giving away too much money to the owners of mobile app stores and would welcome an upstart who lets them keep a bigger slice of the pie. Spotify has gone so far as to recommend people pay for the music service away from Apple's App Store. For people who don't, the price of a Spotify subscription is 30 percent higher to offset the revenue it has to share with Apple.  For companies that rely on powerful gatekeepers like Google and Apple for their livelihood, an Amazon alternative for selling subscriptions could be a breath of fresh air.  This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.

What she described as something new at first sounded pretty much identical to something that has existed for many years: free workshops at Apple Stores. Rebranding and promoting the workshop would make sense, of course. Many Apple customers seem entirely unaware that the workshops exist, while others know about the basic ones but not the more advanced sessions. This was made clear to me when I mentioned on Facebook that I was attending a Final Cut Pro workshop at Apple’s Regent Street store in London, and several friends told me they had no idea these existed. Even among 9to5Mac readers, there were similar comments when I mentioned them in my Final Cut Pro Diary series … NordVPN This isn’t surprising. Click the Workshops & Learning link on Apple’s website and you’ll find no mention at all of Final Cut or Logic Pro workshops. You can only find them by selecting a store first and then scrolling down to the Creative Pro Series. Even then, what shows up is rather random: the first time I did it, I saw two Final Cut workshops, another time three and when I did it just now to illustrate this piece (below), I saw only one. Apple’s free workshops, then, have been a reasonably well-kept secret. Which is a great pity as they are really effective tools to help people get the most out of their Apple hardware and software. I’ve eavesdropped on introductory workshops while waiting to be seen in retail stores, and it’s clear that people get great value from them. I’ve seen a number of ‘Aha!’ moments as people discover something they didn’t know their device could do, or learn about a better or more efficient way to achieve something. And I couldn’t have been more impressed by the Final Cut Pro workshops I’ve done. One of them – Final Cut Pro for Storytellers – packed in so much material that I did it twice. A second one, with the rather mundane-sounding title Import, Sort and Organise in Final Cut Pro X, was just as useful from a creative perspective as it was from a media-management one. I of course appreciate that these pro app workshops have a more limited target audience than the introductory ones, but I was still surprised to see just how few participants showed up. Five the first time, four the second – and for the media-management one there was just one attendee: me. So even if Today at Apple were a simple relaunch of the workshops, it would still be a worthwhile exercise. But looking more closely at what Apple is describing, it’s clear that it is not just promoting the workshops, but also expanding their scope. One of the examples given was of photo walks, customers being given guidance on how to take better photos with their iPhones. Apple clearly wants people to be able to get more from their devices and apps, and especially to help them be more creative. That’s going to result in happy customers, who will likely share the results of their endeavours with friends and on social media, generating more good PR for Apple. A win-win.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « New Apple Dubai Mall Store introduces Motorized 'Solar Wings' that Control the Environmental Conditions of the Store | Main | Apple Pay using Touch ID is targeted in new Patent Lawsuit » April 26, 2017 Report Claims that the Galaxy S8 with Gigabit LTE Modem will Smoke Apple's iPhone 8 for Fastest Downloads   Last week PhoneBuff presented their annual smartphone speed tests and this year's Galaxy S8+ vs. the iPhone 7 Plus showed Apple's smartphone the clear winner when it comes to opening a series of applications. Now a new report strikes back claiming that Apple's iPhone 8 may not support Qualcomm's new Gigabit LTE modem leaving the iPhone at a definite disadvantage. CNBC framed it this way: "The next iPhone may not be able to hold a candle to the Galaxy S8 when it comes to how fast you'll be able to download music and movies or surf the web."   C/NET reported yesterday that "Gigabit LTE will be a signature feature on many high-profile, premium phones this year. Yet Apple's next iPhone, which is still months away from becoming an official product, may not be one of them. Apple designs its own processor and uses modems from Qualcomm and Intel. But Intel's latest commercial-ready modem won't hit Gigabit LTE speeds, which could force Apple to slow down the Qualcomm version to ensure all iPhones are on the same footing.   If Apple opts to skip out on Gigabit LTE, the iPhone 8 will hit the market with a key disadvantage when the company is trying to position the 10th iteration of its iPhone franchise as the most advanced phone yet. The Galaxy S8 is just the first premium phone to tap into the technology. Qualcomm expects up to 10 Android phones this year to follow suit.   While consumers would normally ignore something as wonky as Gigabit LTE, carriers are starting to trumpet the technology as a catalyst for their faster networks. T-Mobile CEO John Legere boasted in January that his company would be the first with Gigabit LTE this year, providing a public spotlight to what could have been an obscure technical term.   What would the next iPhone presumably miss out on? Gigabit LTE promises a significant speed boost to your phone -- think 18 times faster than the average speeds posted by the likes of T-Mobile and Verizon in a recent test by OpenSignal. With those kinds of speeds, you can say goodbye to buffering as downloads zip by in a flash.   Yet in the bigger picture, "Gigabit LTE networks aren't really up and running in any meaningful market, with only T-Mobile mentioning select areas in a few markets capable of getting those speeds. Chief Technology Officer Neville Ray said in an interview on Monday that he didn't think Gigabit LTE would be available nationwide, but the technology would be one way the company could "highlight its network superiority."   But the technology isn't just about bragging rights. As carriers upgrade their networks, your Gigabit LTE-capable phone will get faster and faster. So a phone you buy this year might actually get better in 2018 and beyond.   While C/NET admits that it's unclear what Apple will do for the iPhone 8 and may in fact use Qualcomm's modems, they further state: "But if history repeats itself, Apple could disappoint some looking for the next iPhone to pack the latest and greatest everything."   On the surface the report comes across as a mild propaganda piece for Qualcomm. It's a story that could fit after the iPhone 8 debuts if Apple fails to address the modem issue. For now, however, no one knows what Apple will do, so it's just a lot of noise in the form of FUD (the tactic of using Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt about a competing product).   Apple continues to deal with Samsung as a supplier all the while fighting it out in court over patents, so there's no reason to believe that it'll be any different this time around with Qualcomm, if Apple decides there's no modem workaround.   For those wanting to know more about Gigabit LTE could download Qualcomm's PDF titled "Driving the Gigabit LTE Evolution" here.     About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Reuters/Stephen Lam Apple launched the Apple Watch a couple of years ago. It was the tech giant’s first new creation since company CEO Tim Cook took over. Unfortunately, consumers aren’t really into it that much, even though it was projected to sell like hotcakes. Apple’s smartwatch was supposed to be the ultimate companion device of the iPhone. That alone should have been reason enough for the product to be a huge success. Apple has never fully revealed the exact number of wearables it has sold, and it just gets thrown into the “other products” department in quarterly earnings reports, as noted by QZ. This only means that the watch is not as relevant as Apple wants it to be. The Cupertino, California-based company’s “other products” – which include the Apple TV, iPod, Beats products and accessories – only represent 5 percent of the iPhone maker’s total income as of the moment. Even the latest version of the smartwatch hasn’t provided considerable effect on revenue. According to a recent survey done by consumer marketing firm Fluent, non-smartwatch owners are less than enthusiastic about purchasing an Apple timepiece in the near future. Only a small percentage of the 1,339 respondents declared that they are close to buying a unit anytime soon. “Consumers who do not currently own any type of smartwatch are not as keen to adopt the trend,” says Fluent. “Only 5 percent say that they ‘definitely will purchase’ an Apple Watch in the next year, with high cost and belief that the device is not useful being the main deterrents.” It’s also not surprising that the main followers of Apple’s computerised wristwatch are current owners of the company’s products. About 15 percent of iPhone users in the US say they own the watch. But even though the watch owners continue to be loyal to the product, only 49 percent intend to upgrade their unit in 2017 compared to last year’s 62 percent. This does not bode well for Apple at all. It’s even losing a huge chunk of the market to simpler wearables like Fitbit. Good thing that the survey also notes that more consumers believe that smartwatches are here to stay and is set to remain. In the survey, 60 percent of the respondents are certain that the majority of US consumers are going to own smartwatches 10 years from now. Last year, only 50 percent had the same belief. The Apple Watch has enough time to recover and break out.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile There’s one impressive next-gen Galaxy S8 feature the iPhone 8 likely won’t match Image Source: Moe Slah, ConceptsiPhone Zach Epstein @zacharye April 26th, 2017 at 8:49 AM Share Tweet When it comes to smartphones, there are so many key areas that are important to users. Design, software, apps, battery life, price, and performance are all key factors, as is speed. And when it comes to speed, Samsung’s new Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ are the two fastest Android phones that have been released to date. They utilize new 10nm octa-core processors, Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 835 in the US and Samsung’s Exynos 8895 elsewhere. They also sport the most optimized version yet of the Samsung Experience, formerly known as TouchWiz. But there’s another factor that contributes to smartphone speed, and a new report suggests Samsung’s just-released Galaxy S8 will smoke the iPhone 8 when it’s released later this year. Don't Miss: New rumor says everything we know about the iPhone 8 release is wrong There’s plenty we think we know about Apple’s upcoming iPhone 8, which is expected to be announced this September alongside new iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus models. To mark the tenth anniversary of the original iPhone’s release, Apple will reportedly give the iPhone a complete design overhaul. The home button will be removed from the phone’s face, and the screen-to-body ratio is expected to be even more impressive than the 83% achieved by Samsung’s Galaxy S8 and S8+. We can also likely look forward to a new Touch ID scanner embedded in the display, new cameras on the front and back, nifty new augmented reality features, 3D scanning features, and a lightning-fast A11 processor. But where speed is concerned, it appears as though there’s one thing we shouldn’t expect: Gigabit LTE. In a speculative piece published this week, CNET noted that Apple’s upcoming new iPhones may not support the new faster wireless standard carriers are currently working to roll out. Dubbed “Gigabit LTE” because of its theoretical 1Gbps top data transfer speed, the new standard is already being tested by wireless carriers in the United States. Samsung’s new Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ include support for the new faster wireless standard, and several other Android phones that launch in 2017 will also be compatible with Gigabit LTE. Apple’s iPhone 8, however, may not support the faster download and upload speeds offered by Gigabit LTE. As CNET pointed out, Apple uses modems built by both Qualcomm and Intel in its current iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus models. Should Apple continue to utilize both suppliers, only one of the iPhone 8’s modems — the Qualcomm model — will support Gigabit LTE. As a result, Apple may intentionally slow the Qualcomm model to match the performance of the Intel model, as it has allegedly done with the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. “This is not an area where Apple should want to cede competitive ground to Google and Samsung,” GlobalData analyst Avi Greengart told CNET. Operating on the assumption that this speculation turns out to be accurate, does it really matter? Does it matter if Apple decides to “cede competitive ground” to it Android rivals in 2017? Probably not Smartphone data connections aren’t like home internet connections, where capacity is important because multiple devices are utilizing available bandwidth. If you run a speed test on your smartphone right now, you might see speeds of 30Mbps, 40Mbps or even more. Those are blazing-fast speeds, but it’s only important to a degree. First, there aren’t very many mobile services that are even capable of using speeds that fast — just like how large file downloads on your home computer might only hit 5Mbps even though you have a 100Mbps connection. Beyond that, any service that actually does utilize faster Gigabit LTE speeds would devour data caps in no time. What about unlimited plans? Sorry, but they’re all capped as well. The amount of full-speed data varies from one carrier to the next, but all unlimited plans include soft-caps of less than 30GB per billing period. After that, data speeds are likely to be throttled. Down the road, next-gen technologies like Gigabit LTE and 5G will be crucial because more data-hungry services like live-streamed VR will roll out, and soft caps on “unlimited” data plans will be adjusted to accommodate them. But we’re not there yet, and we won’t get there anytime this year. Keep that in mind when Apple unveils the iPhone 8 (or iPhone Edition, or iPhone Pro, or whatever Apple decides to call it) this coming September.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile How badly do you want this stunning iPhone 8 to be real? Image Source: Gabor Balogh Yoni Heisler @edibleapple April 26th, 2017 at 9:18 AM Share Tweet The iPhone 8 is arguably the most highly anticipated iPhone release we’ve seen in quite some time. Sure, everyone was excited about Apple finally introducing larger-screened iPhone models, first with the iPhone 5 and later with the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, but the amount of hype surrounding the iPhone 8 seems to be at a whole another level. And with good cause, the iPhone 8 promises to deliver a radical overhaul to the entire user experience, both in hardware and in software. In addition to an edgeless OLED display, there have also been strong rumblings from the rumor mill suggesting that the iPhone 8 will introduce advanced augmented reality features. Don't Miss: Behold: This Galaxy Note 8 blows the Galaxy S8 out of the water Earlier this week, photos of an alleged “dummy” iPhone 8 model surfaced online, perhaps giving us our best look yet at what Apple’s next-gen iPhone will actually look like. Following up on that, the folks over at ConceptsiPhone recently put together a brand new iPhone 8 concept video which provide us with an all-encompassing three-dimensional view of Apple’s 2017 flagship iPhone. Now to be fair, some aspects of the video don’t quite align with some of the rumors we’ve seen floating around. For example, the video depicts a white ceramic iPhone 8, a device that likely isn’t on Apple’s roadmap this year, if ever. Further, the video depicts an iPhone with speakers on every corner of the device, yet another design that will likely never see the light of day. Thirdly, the camera module in the video is positioned horizontally, a design seemingly at odds with a plethora of schematic leaks we’ve seen over the past few weeks. Nonetheless, with the iPhone 8 release still months away, it’s still intriguing to take a look at iPhone 8 concept videos featuring forward-thinking designs, even if they’re not actually on the horizon. Most impressively, the video above gives us a more immersive look at how an edgeless OLED display might impact the user experience. Our only gripe, however minor, is that many concept videos only give us a taste of what the iOS homescreen might look like as opposed to showing us how popular apps might take advantage of an edge to edge display. One thing we hope the video gets right, though, is an embedded Touch ID sensor in the display itself, a design Apple is reportedly struggling with. If you’re intrigued by the seemingly never-ending world of iPhone 8 concept videos, the one below from Macitynet is well worth checking out.

There are amoebic creatures with bulbous appendages, others with angular faceted shells; some seem to stare out with cyclopean eyes or gaping circular mouths. Westminster’s gilded avenue of gentlemen’s clubs, where kings and earls once strode, is an appropriate place for what turns out to be a display of our modern-day vessels of power. These bleached bodies are the headquarters buildings of the world’s biggest technology companies, as seen through the detached, deadpan eyes of artist duo Langlands & Bell. “Our obsession started when we came across Norman Foster’s plan for the new Apple campus in Cupertino,” says Ben Langlands, gesturing towards an image of a pristine white doughnut bristling with a regimented stubble of tiny columns. The first of the $5bn building’s 12,000 employees will move into the mothership this month, welcomed into a mile-long closed loop of offices, lined with brushed aluminium and clad with the largest panes of curved glass the world has ever seen, every element fitted with the precision of an iPhone. “It is a fantasy of total control,” says Nikki Bell. “It oozes strategy, ambition, globalisation and technology; it so thoroughly embodies what these companies are about,” she adds. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Facebook Menlo Park, 2017, the artists’ take on the tech giant’s HQ. Photograph: Langlands & Bell/Courtesy artist and Alan Cristea Gallery, London Now in their late 50s and early 60s, the provocative pair have been probing the darker side of what they call “strategic architecture” for the past three decades, constructing immaculate white models of buildings that speak of networks of wider global influence beyond their four walls. Since the late 1980s, they have trained their laser-sharp gaze on everything from the big banks of Frankfurt, to the geometric headquarters of Nato and Unesco, to the sprawling panopticon penitentiaries of the US and international courts of justice – as well as Osama bin Laden’s house in Afghanistan. Bringing a clinical precision to their subjects, they lay their victims on the operating table and conduct a cool-headed autopsy, peeling back facades and lifting off rooftops to lay bare the bones of power for all to see. “We’re providing a kind of privileged access,” says Bell, “stripping away the envelope and revealing the innards.” Recently they have been drawn to the emphatically geometric headquarters of California’s tech giants because they see an intriguing conflict of representation, a disconnect between symbol and subject. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Nvidia (Santa Clara), 2016. Photograph: Langlands & Bell/Courtesy artist and Alan Cristea Gallery, London “It’s a real moment in history,” says Langlands. “Only 20 or 30 years ago, these companies were really quite modest, just starting up and operating out of garages, yet now they are some of the biggest corporations in the world. They seem a little bit self-conscious about building these huge monumental edifices, while claiming to maintain the casual start-up jeans-and-T-shirt culture.” The identity crisis is most apparent in the form of Frank Gehry’s gargantuan Facebook building in Menlo Park, a vast corporate HQ that still wants to be an informal garage. Rambling along the highway for 40,000 square metres, it is the biggest single office space in the world, disguised as an ad-hoc shed, with the appearance of a series of aircraft hangers haphazardly bolted together. In the exhibition, it is depicted as a coloured plan-view model, with the various grades of meeting pods scattered across the open-plan floor like a psychedelic fungus, each “neighbourhood” of desks connected by a meandering walking loop designed for unplanned encounters; employees are encouraged to “hack” their space. On a wall nearby floats a structure of a very different kind, the hermetic shell of the Nvidia headquarters in Santa Clara, designed for the graphics-processor giant by corporate architecture firm Gensler. The architects’ website trumpets that the building has been “designed around how people move, demonstrating design from the inside out”, conceived as a place where “oversized platforms replace stairways as vertical connectors and serve to stage impromptu meetings and interactions”. But the generic interior doesn’t interest Langlands & Bell. Instead they’ve chosen to show the building with the menacing air of a stealth-bomber, paired with an imaginary doppelganger, their crumpled triangular forms hovering above the page like drones ready to strike. While much of the duo’s previous work has focused on lifting off rooftops to reveal regimented symmetrical layouts, most of the tech headquarters in this exhibition are shown from an aerial perspective, from the impossible bird’s eye view (or Google Earth view), which is the only way most of us will ever encounter them. “People have become so used to seeing buildings without even going there,” says Langlands. “Headquarters like these have a life of their own as iconic images, produced, shared and consumed in the form of computer renders.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest Nikki Bell, left, and Ben Langlands. Photograph: Vismedia The artists rarely visit the sites in question nor speak to the architects, but undertake desktop research and download drawings from municipal planning authority websites to build up the required information. The plans are often unavailable for security reasons, so they frequently rely on the promotional perspective views, which give their images an eerie familiarity. These are PR shots lifted from the blogs and billboards, but bleached of the surface gloss of the original image, stripped back to reveal the lifeless skeletons beneath. This ghostly white aesthetic has become more familiar since the rise of 3D printing, but Langlands & Bell’s process is refreshingly luddite – they trained in the 1970s, so prefer scalpels to B-splines. They still construct each model by hand, layering up card and foam-board to form a “two-and-a-half dimensional” relief, before photographing and digitally manipulating the images, adding the shadows and eye-searing background colours, which gives this series the appropriately corporate gloss of a series of Pantone swatches. Some are shown as models, others as editioned prints. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Apple Sunnyvale, 2017 – one of the artists’ precise models. Photograph: Langlands & Bell/Courtesy artist and Alan Cristea Gallery, London One of the biggest relief models in the exhibition is of another Apple campus, this time in Sunnyvale, designed by HOK Architects as a poor relation of Foster’s UFO. Planned as a speculative office building by a local family firm, then entirely bought up by Apple, it borrows the horizontal white louvres of Foster’s building, but wraps them around an undulating trefoil form, topped with a rooftop garden – which the developers proudly call “Open Space³”. It could be one of George Lucas’s intergalactic starships, making a bid to fly free from its circular frame. Its tripartite composition is echoed across the room in the 60,000 sq m Gates Foundation in Seattle, planned as a trio of swooshing boomerang-shaped wings, like arrows pointing towards the three directions of their global endeavours: eradicating disease, cutting childhood deaths in Africa by half, and overhauling the US education system. “All architecture is planning for the future in some way,” says Langlands. “But a foundation like this is planning at another level, and expressing it in a very self-conscious and programmed way.” It is “a campus that inspires and creates optimism and hope,” according to its architects, NBBJ. Or, as Bell puts it: “It indicates they have amassed a huge amount of cash and want to be seen to be doing good with it.” Langlands & Bell: Infinite Loop is at Alan Cristea Gallery, London, 27 April–3 June.

Here's why Saurabh Singh   |   @singh_saurabh10 Last Updated: APR 26, 2017 New Delhi Email Author The Jet Black edition of the iPhone 7 is nothing short of an engineering marvel. It must have taken Apple lots of effort and skill to polish - nay super polish - all that stone-cold metal to look like glass. "The Jet Black finish is accomplished through an innovative nine-step process of anodisation and polish for a uniform, glossy finish," according to the Cupertino major. To cut the long story short, the Jet Black edition of the iPhone 7 looks gorgeous. You know what looks even better? Samsung's new Galaxy S8. Also Read: Samsung Galaxy S8, Galaxy S8+ review: Cutting the edge and doing it in style Calling the Galaxy S8 gorgeous will be an understatement. On a regular day, it would easily pass off as a limited edition device, the kind that only a high-profile fashion company could conjure. And charge you nothing short of a bomb for it. Apple and HTC are often credited for making the proverbial smartphone look good. Henceforth, Samsung will be credited for making them look even better. Curvier. Fact is Samsung has been churning out gorgeous handsets since the days of the Galaxy S6. It was about the same time, it is said, that it started imagining the Galaxy S8 as well. The Galaxy S8 -- code-named Dream -- would be a long continuous sheet of glass with an edge-to-edge display and no physical buttons. The Galaxy S8, on first look, appears to be a hybrid cross between the Galaxy S7 Edge and the ill-fated Galaxy Note 7. It's no surprise then, that it's carved out of glass -- Corning's new Gorilla Glass 5 -- and metal. Only in the case of the Galaxy S8, the metallic centerpiece that joins the front and back is virtually non-existent. And it's polished in a way that it gives out the impression that the whole thing is one continuous sheet of glass, again, just the way Samsung had imagined on the drawing board. The Galaxy S8, especially when it's powered down with an Always-on display, is a sight to behold. The front, in the case of the Galaxy S8, is clean and without any physical buttons. Samsung, for the first time in what seems like forever, has moved the fingerprint scanner from the front on to the back. The home button, is meanwhile, software-based. It is also pressure-sensitive and gives you haptic feedback when you press it, kind of how it is in the case of Apple's iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. But, while the iPhone has a dedicated area -- atop a chunky lower bezel -- to serve the purpose, Samsung's phone employs what you can call an invisible solution. Samsung, for the first time in what seems like forever, has also incorporated software-based back and recent keys -- in the case of the Galaxy S8 -- which are also editable. Sigh. You can now place the back key where it was always meant to be. On the left, of course. On-screen navigation keys are of course no taboo for the world of Android. What is, in fact, a taboo for Android phones are bezels (or rather the lack of them). Those wide unattractive strips (of plastic, glass or metal) that occupy the top, bottom and sides of most smartphones. The Galaxy S8 has almost no bezels. To be a little more precise, it is all screen and no bezels. To be a little more precise, the phone gives you almost 83 per cent of screen-to-body ratio. In a compact palm-sized form factor. The Galaxy S8, because it has almost no bezels, occupies a much smaller footprint -- size as well as girth -- in comparison to most 5.5-inch phones. The Galaxy S8, for your reference, has a 5.8-inch screen. But, when in the hands, it feels almost the same size as the iPhone 7. The iPhone 7 is a 4.7-inch phone, for your reference. Being all-glass, however, has its downsides. The Galaxy S8 attracts fingerprints and smudge by the millisecond. It can also be super glossy for some. But, it surely isn't slippery. An all glass (and metal) phone that isn't slippery is hard to find. The Galaxy S8, without a doubt, has to be the most ergonomic all-glass phone in smartphone history. And very pocket-able. Because, it isn't slippery (enough) you can afford to play around with it without having to worry about accidentally dropping and breaking its glorious curved screen. Should you, however shatter it, you must know Samsung isn't offering any accidental cover. What it is offering though is a choice of as many as nine different cover accessories that you can buy separately. But whatever you do, don't drop it. Ever. You're allowed to drop it in the shower though because the Galaxy S8 is IP68-certified for dust and water resistance. It's not perfect by all means, the Galaxy S8, but for the first time in a very long time, there's very little to complain about a Samsung Galaxy S phone simply because there aren't many visible kinks in its armor to really make a hue and cry about. And oh, it comes with a 3.5mm audio jack.

But there is one trend from 2016 that is becoming increasingly popular with flagship smartphones – dual cameras. Smartphone evolution would be incomplete without advancements in smartphone cameras and dual cameras seem the next frontier for the technology. The trend started with the iPhone 7 Plus. Even though the smaller size Apple flagship, the iPhone 7 had a single lens camera, Apple endowed the larger phone with two camera lenses packed in a single camera module. The setup made a huge difference in terms of camera performance —effective zoom went up to 10x, which created a huge difference in the depth-of field in photos. Read: Leaked Dummy Hints That iPhone 8 Could Have Vertical Dual-Camera Since Apple showcased how dual-cameras made a difference in photography, many smartphone companies seem to have become interested in endowing their smartphones with the technology. Here are 5 smartphones expected to come with a dual-camera setup in 2017: Samsung Galaxy Note 8:  Samsung's second flagship, expected to release in September, might have a dual-camera setup. Tech informant Eldar Murtazin tweeted a leaked image of the device on April 16.  He claims that the phone in the image is a Note 8 prototype, featuring the dual camera setup. Samsung hasn’t yet put out any information about the Note 8. Until it does, we will have to rely on leaks and rumors for an idea of what the phone will look like. Apple iPhone 8: Apple’s 10th anniversary device might also feature a dual-camera setup, but instead of a horizontal one like the iPhone 7S, it could feature a vertical one. Benjamin Geskin, renowned phone leaker claimed in a tweet Monday that he had acquired a computer numerical control (CNC) model of the upcoming device. CNC models are used in advances stages of device testing and might be an indication of what the final device would be. It makes sense for Apple to opt, once again, for a dual-camera setup after the iPhone 7 Plus, which received rave reviews for its camera performance. OnePlus 5:  The next OnePlus device, which is expected to launch in June is also expected to feature a dual-camera setup, according to an image of the device obtained by India Today Wednesday, which shows a vertical dual-camera setup merged into a seamless back cover. Google Pixel 2: Google’s Pixel successor is also expected to feature a dual-camera setup, according to Wccftech, which obtained some concept renders of the device in March. Read: Samsung Galaxy Note 8 vs. Google Pixel 2 LG’s V20 successor: LG was the original company to endow its phones with dual-cameras, even though its G5 flagship, which released with the feature in 2016, did not do well. The company’s V20 smartphone’s successor, expected to release in the second half of the year, might come with a dual-camera setup, according to Neowin.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 26 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman Upside Introduces New App for iPhone, Exclusively Available on the App Store WASHINGTON, April 26, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — Today, with the launch of the Upside app, business travelers in small to medium-sized companies who make their own travel arrangements can buy their business travel on their iPhone in five minutes or less. Upside is known for providing the lowest travel prices on the internet, packaging flights and hotel together in one low price, saving the company money, and rewarding employees for doing so with personal rewards on major retailer gift cards (customers also get all their frequent flyer miles and credit card points). Upside does all the hard work for the business traveler: sorting through tens of thousands of itinerary options to present the 6 best options for business-quality flights and the 6 best options for hotels on every trip. For the first time, with Upside, employees are excited to save money for their companies, because the more they save on their business travel, the more gift card rewards they receive. Upside is the business travel service that changes how travelers shop, save and get rewarded for buying business travel. Now, with the release of the Upside app, the most efficient internet travel shopping experience got even faster. The Upside app for iPhone is available for free in the App Store and was featured in „New Apps We Love” on release. „For nearly 20 years, shopping for business flights and hotels online has been time-consuming and frustrating,” said Upside Founder and CEO Jay Walker. „It could take hours to shop, hunt and compare; and after all that work, customers from small and medium-sized businesses still weren’t sure they got the best price. „Upside changed all that, and with our new app we double down on our promise to make buying business travel fast,” Walker continued. „And Apple Pay makes it better still – even easier and faster. Now customers can shop and buy a package of business-quality flights and hotels with their phone in one hand, using one thumb, in five minutes flat.” Apple Pay and the Upside App Apple Pay’s easy, one-touch, secure payment process enhances the best business travel buying experience on the internet. Sean Soper, Upside’s Lead iOS Engineer, says, „Upside’s app is the kind of collaboration between engineers and developers that creates a great product – in Upside’s case, a tool that helps business customers succeed. Using Apple tools such as Swift 3 and MapKit, the Upside app is a fast and sleek user experience. With the Upside app, the business traveler’s phone is now a powerful personal travel buying engine.” The new Upside iPhone app is designed in a streamlined fashion that enables customers to see, select and buy business-quality flights and hotels in just a few screens. Hoby Albright, Upside’s Director of Product Design, added, „Using Apple best practices, we made the design clean and spare – incorporated high resolution images, navigation in the thumb zone — and focused on the information business travelers need, so they can easily navigate with one thumb and don’t have to sift through a bunch of design layers to buy their travel.”  The Upside app for iPhone enables customers to: Purchase Trips. View Trip History and Frequent Flyer Miles. Select Gift Cards and View Gift Card Account & History. Easily Contact Upside’s 24/7 Live Customer Service Representatives. Upside’s Big Data software does all the work for the customer – pre-processing 1 billion flight records and 500 million hotel records daily. Walker concluded: „Upside represents the first unique buying idea for business travel in 15 years. For the first time, business travelers from smaller and mid-sized companies can get discounts that were previously only available to the big guys –and they finally get the service they need and deserve.” About Upside.com Upside serves the annual $165 billion segment of business travelers who work for small and mid-sized companies.  These companies don’t qualify for volume discounts or special deals from travel suppliers and can’t get the kind of customer service they need.  Upside uses new thinking and new technology to simplify the buying process, and provide 24/7 live, human customer service. Upside’s business model is unique – travelers typically get $100-$200 in free gift cards for buying their flights and hotel together for a single price. This packaging allows Upside to obtain private discounts from suppliers.  And, when travelers voluntarily substitute less expensive but equally effective travel options, they get even bigger savings and a bigger gift card reward. Gift cards can be used at more than 50 national retailers including Amazon.com, Whole Foods, Target, Nike, and The Home Depot. Upside was created and launched by Priceline Founder Jay Walker and a team of travel industry innovation pioneers, including several members of Priceline’s founding team.  With Upside, the days are over when business travelers from small and mid-sized companies have to spend more and settle for less than leisure or big-company travelers.  Upside is the better way to buy business travel when the customer is booking it themselves.  For more information, visit: upside.com or follow us on LinkedIn, Twitter and Facebook.

Apple said that it hit the milestone some five and a half years after launching version 10 of the professional video editing app. Notably, it said that the pace of adoption was increasing. While the company didn’t provide specific dates, it said that it had taken much less time to grow from 1M to 2M users than it had taken to hit that first million. The milestone is significant given initial reactions to the app … NordVPN Apple completely rewrote Final Cut Pro when it launched version 10, to an initially hostile reception. Jan Ozer of OnlineVideo said that ‘Apple was trying to change the workflows of professionals who knew more about video production than any of the engineers who created the product.’ Hollywood film editor Walter Murch said simply ‘I can’t use this.’ There was even a petition calling for Apple to either revert the software to version 7, or to sell the business. The furore over the new user interface and removal of what were considered core pro features became so well-known that Conan O’Brien mocked the software on his Conan late night show. Final Cut Pro creator Randy Ubillos anticipated the reaction, and suggested that Apple give people a free copy of version 7 alongside version 10 so that they had a choice of UI and also time to adapt to the new approach. Apple rejected this idea. Revisions by Apple, third-party plugins and the simple time it takes to adjust to a new UI eventually saw the app gain widespread acceptance, and it now sits alongside Adobe Premiere as one of the two leading professional non-linear video editing apps. Final Cut Pro X is a $299 purchase from the Mac App Store. A 30-day free trial is available. Video courtesy of RichardTaylorTV. Photo: CreativeLive.

Now, according to Reuters, the premiere has been pushed back until "later this year". Image: YouTube/Apple Carpool Karaoke: The Series is one of Apple's first big bets on content — the company is also planning the awful-looking, Shark Tank-style "reality" show Planet of the Apps, as well as a scripted series starring Dr Dre. Based on its trailer, Carpool Karaoke: The Series looks like an extended version of the popular segment on The Late Late Show with James Corden. The "Carpool Karaoke" segments, in which Corden goes for a drive with a famous celebrity musician, singing their tunes along the way, has wracked up more than a billion views on YouTube for CBS. The segments are also cloying and annoying — and our preview from Apple doesn't look any better. We're not sure why Apple has delayed its first series (we reached out to the company for comment but had not received a response at time of writing), but the optics aren't great. Reuters reports that Apple, a company known for meticulous and well-planned launches, has twice cancelled its launch party plans for the show. The series, whenever it does launch, will be exclusive for Apple Music subscribers. On one hand, given how bad it looks, Apple should probably just forget about Carpool Karaoke and let the series go to syndication (or the Spike TV network, where a nearly-identical show is already airs), just to put us all out of our misery. But on the other hand — the hand holding a giant bag full of money — though Carpool Karaoke: The Series will almost certainly be terrible, it has a much better chance at success than the sure-to-be-awful Planet of the Apps. That abomination is still slated for a premiere this autumn, though who knows at this point. As we discussed in January — when word of some of Apple's broader content ambitions started to leak — the content game is tough. Companies such as Netflix and Amazon are spending billions of dollars on original programming every year. If Apple really wants to compete with the big guys, it needs to be willing to spend money on content — preferably content that is higher-quality than late-night TV spin-offs or bad "reality" shows. But recent reports indicate that no one in Hollywood, not even Apple, fully understands what the company is trying to do. The good news, we suppose, is that it will likely be at least a few more weeks before we're all bombarded with bad James Corden Apple Music ads again.

I can't imagine why some exec thinks people will watch 30+ minutes of karaoke in one sitting. Lip-Sync battles is a bit more interesting, but it's hard to watch a whole show of that too.

While the smartphone itself has turned out to be a mystery, various reports point it out to be an Apple iPhone 8. What is impressive, is not its name tagged as ‘iPhone 10.6’ but its scores that seemed to have taken the Geekbench smartphone benchmark standards to a whole new level. Yes, this alleged Apple iPhone 8 has destroyed every other smartphone in existence on the Geekbench score. If the leaked screenshot turns out to be a genuine one, this iPhone 8 prototype has scored a massive 4,537 on a single core, while the multi-core results go all the way up to a stunning 8,975. The only other device that comes close is last year’s Apple iPhone 7 that scored a healthy 3,328 on single core and a 5,508 in the multi-core test. Image: Weibo Comparing it to Android will make fans of flagship smartphones look away in shame indeed. The highest we have on the Android flagship benchmarks is the Exynos-powered Samsung Galaxy S8 that we tested out personally and showcased a single score of 2,020 (which now seems like a typo in comparison) while multi-core scores faired better at 6,730. Indeed these are raw performance numbers of a phone that is yet to be announced officially, but there are a couple interesting bits. The Geekbench result obtained by this Weibo user also revealed a few hardware details about this mystery smartphone. Image: iDrop News The smartphone runs iOS 11.0 as its operating system with the hardware motherboard number tagged as S58AP. The processor is called the Apple A11 and its clocked at an unbelievable 2.7 GHz with 4 cores. Apple’s current chip goes up to 2.34 GHz so the performance jump is pretty large and will be enough for Phil Schiller to brag about at the September launch. Attached to the post also comes the screen resolution that is set at 2,800 x 1,242 pixels. That sets it at a rather odd 20.2:9 aspect ratio that is a lot taller than the Samsung Galaxy S8. But with the home button gone, may be Apple could add something extra below the usual iPhone homescreen interface. Indeed, this is just a screenshot, which can be faked easily, so we do request you to take the above information with spoonful of salt.

This also led to rumors that this year’s iPhone could end up using OLED as well. However it seems that maybe the use of OLED might be a transitionary process because in a report from Business Korea (via AppleInsider), Apple could soon make the switch to micro LED. The report claims that Apple has been working with LuxVue for the past two years. For those unfamiliar, Apple acquired the company several years ago. The report also claims that Apple could begin using micro LEDs for the Apple Watch Series 3 which is expected to be launched later this year. This is actually not the first time we have heard such a claim. In fact Apple had also previously filed patents that suggested that such a change could be coming. In addition, the report suggests that Apple could potentially use micro LED technology in its iPhones, which is said to be causing some concerns for the likes of Samsung and LG who have been supplying displays to Apple. When exactly this will be happening remains to be seen, so until then take it with a grain of salt for now. Filed in Apple >Gadgets >Rumors. Read more about Apple Watch, Smartwatch and Wearable Tech.

Before starting at Harvard Business School in 2008, she emailed Steve Jobs, explaining that she’d been confounded to learn that her school didn’t partner with Apple. She asked Jobs to give her the same discount on the Macbook Air that her school offered for the IBM Thinkpad. The Apple CEO responded—and granted her wish. Today, Beauchamp says that cold-emailing was essential to the success of Birchbox—an industry-changing beauty-supply subscription service, launched in 2010, that boasts over 1 million subscribers. When she and her partner Hayley Barna conceived of the company while still at Harvard, they had less than six months to test the service before graduation. “I wasn’t aware of industry events (because I wasn’t in the industry) and we were looking to move quickly and efficiently,” Beauchamp writes via email. She knew that Birchbox needed feedback from major players in the beauty industry, whom she hoped to recruit as partners. So she began cold-emailing top executives, inviting them to poke holes in her idea. Here’s how she got important, busy people to respond—and how you can do the same. Have a compelling, punchy subject line If the subject line doesn’t motivate the reader to open the message, no dice, says Beauchamp. “At the very least it should say something more than ‘Hello’ or ‘Looking to get in touch,'” she explains, since these common subject lines can easily get lost in a packed inbox. Beauchamp used the subject line, “Reimagining beauty online.” She knew “I’m selling beauty samples” was a sure “delete,” given industry skepticism at the time about the idea of profiting off otherwise free give-aways. Plus, as she frequently explains in interviews, she didn’t want Birchbox to be known for selling beauty samples; the goal was to create a company that would help women discover new beauty products cheaply and conveniently and change how beauty was sold online. So when forming a subject line in a cold email, it’s essential to capture your higher-level motivation—not just what your idea is, but why it might matter to the person on the receiving end. Keep it short Long-winded emails aren’t impressive—they’re draining. Beauchamp’s rule of thumb: “The email should be short enough so that a person can read it without having to scroll down on his or her phone. The less time and energy it takes to read it, the better.” That means one or two brief body paragraphs, each composed of two to three short sentences, max. Don’t attach long documents When reaching out for career or business advice, it can be tempting to send your full portfolio or a business plan. But this is a mistake, according to Beauchamp, since it demands a lot of the other person’s time and can easily make them feel overwhelmed. She suggests trying a one-pager that briefly describes your business idea—or, for non-entrepreneurs, a one-page resume or letter. Beauchamp framed her one-pager by succinctly explaining how Birchbox would help, not challenge, the already-dominant brands in the beauty industry. This approach shifts the cold email from a request to an enticing offer. Ask for something that’s easy to say yes to A vague, open-ended email is not worth writing—the recipient is unlikely to respond if they don’t even understand what you’re asking for. But ask for too much, and you’ve crossed the line from confident to presumptuous. The happy medium is to figure out a concrete (yet low-commitment) ask. “I asked CEOs and brand managers for five minutes of their time to give me advice,” says Beauchamp. Everyone can spare five minutes—the time it takes for a bathroom break, or walk to the subway. Plus, asking for a few minutes demonstrates respect for the other person’s time, as well as confidence in one’s ability to network efficiently. The upshot Ultimately, the most important thing Beauchamp gained from her cold emails was confidence. She got turned down plenty, but the positive responses reinforced her belief in the company. “Given that there are also a lot of discouraging moments, it was invaluable to have those bright spots,” she reflects. Cold emailing may often feel like you’re sending messages into a black hole. But for Beauchamp, some of those emails eventually turned into meetings. Some of the meetings turned into pitches. And the pitches ultimately led to partnerships with massive beauty brands. So go ahead and hit send—just keep things short and focused.

Headline features include views of the world’s tallest building, the Burj Khalifa, and a 180-feet wide motorized window comprising 18 carbon fiber panels. To mitigate Dubai’s climate, Foster + Parters designed eighteen 37.5-foot-high motorized “Solar Wings” that respond to the ever-changing environmental conditions. When the sun is at its hottest they cool the store, and in the evenings they open to welcome everyone to the public terrace. Inspired by the the traditional Arabic Mashrabiya, each “Solar Wing” is locally fabricated from 340 carbon fiber reinforced polymer rods, and at 180 feet wide, the 18 panels make up one of the world’s largest kinetic art installations. The store will also provide great views of another Dubai attraction … NordVPN Each evening, there is a spectacular evening fountain show directly outside the store, and Apple is inviting visitors to use that 18-foot wide opening window to view the display. Video of the fountain display can be seen below. Apple’s announcement of the opening also focuses on its rebranded and expanded store workshops, Today at Apple. This initiative was revealed in a CBS interview yesterday. At the heart of every Apple Store is the drive to educate and inspire. “Today at Apple“ will launch at Apple Dubai Mall and in all 495 Apple stores next month with new sessions across photo and video, music, coding, art and design, and more, led by highly-trained team members. Apple Dubai Mall will also host high-profile events including live music, intimate conversations with film-makers and photographers, and live workshops with some of the world’s top talent. Events on opening day include Live Art with Myneandyours, and Artist Duos with musician Hamdan Al Abri and artist Sultan Al Ramahi. These will be run by Creative Pros, a new position we first discovered in August of last year. The motorized windows look pretty spectacular. Here’s a look at the fountain display visitors will be able to enjoy from the store. I’ve viewed it myself from ground level, and I think the Apple Store will provide an even better angle.

Of course, that sort of makes sense since no iPhone in history has ever been as impressive or capable as Apple’s iPhone 7 Plus. It has the fastest performance out there, the best camera out there, and battery life that outshines every other smartphone on the market. All that comes at a substantial price, of course, which is why it’s so important to take advantage when rare iPhone 7 Plus sales come around. Well, it just so happens that one of those sales just came around. eBay is currently selling refurbished 32GB iPhone 7 Plus handsets for $80 less than the cost of a new 32GB iPhone 7. Black is the only color left in stock, so definitely jump on this deal as quickly as you can. Of note, the seller has 98% positive feedback with more than 37,000 buyer ratings, so it’s save to say they’re trustworthy. A few notes about the refurb process from the product page: An item that has been professionally restored to working order by a Carrier-approved vendor. This means the product has been inspected, cleaned, and repaired to meet manufacturer specifications. Device will show signs of wear like scratches, scuffs, and minor dents. This item will not be in the original packaging and includes an MFi-certified lightning cable and UL-listed charger.

Late last night Apple posted a report on the new Apple Dubai Mall store, which has a 186-foot curved storefront and balcony overlooking Burj Khalifa and the Dubai Fountain. Envisioned as a space for the community to gather, learn and be entertained, Apple Dubai Mall will also serve as a venue to watch the spectacular evening fountain shows and will host Apple's new global in-store experience. Apple's location overlooking the lake will stay open as late as midnight to everyone exploring the area.   Like many of Apple's other significant stores, Apple Dubai Mall aims to be open and transparent, blurring the barriers between inside and out, to erase the boundaries between the store and the community. To mitigate Dubai's climate, Foster + Partners designed eighteen 37.5-foot-high motorized "Solar Wings" that respond to the ever-changing environmental conditions. When the sun is at its hottest they cool the store, and in the evenings they open to welcome everyone to the public terrace. Inspired by the the traditional Arabic Mashrabiya, each "Solar Wing" is locally fabricated from 340 carbon fiber reinforced polymer rods, and at 180 feet wide, the 18 panels make up one of the world's largest kinetic art installations. The panels in the closed position can be seen in our cover graphic. Below is another angle of the store showing the swing out windows/"Solar Wings" in the open position.   Angela Ahrendts, Apple's senior vice president, Retail stated at the press event that "We view our stores as a modern-day town square, where visitors come to shop, be inspired, learn or connect with others in their community. And what better place to come together than overlooking Dubai's epicenter, where the Dubai Fountain, Burj Khalifa and Dubai Mall meet. We are so honored to have a home at one of the world's most incredible and dynamic intersections."     All of the store's 148 employees are ready to welcome customers from around the world and speak a collective 45 languages. Angela Ahrendts spoke to the press about the new 'Today at Apple' progam that will be go into effect starting tomorrow when the new store officially opens to the public and tourists.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Features Reviews Phones Android iPhone Windows Phone Apps Computers Laptops Lenovo Tablets Windows Tutorials Events More Audio Crowfunding Design/Concepts Gadgets Gaming General Photo/Video Web Ubergizmo in French Ubergizmo in German Ubergizmo in Italian Ubergizmo in Spanish Dutch Court Bars Apple From Replacing iPads With Refurbished Units By Tyler Lee on 04/26/2017 03:18 PDT Under Apple Care if you were to send in your device and it were to be replaced, sometimes what you end up with is a refurbished unit. What this means is that this device has been used before, but it has been cleaned up and has had certain parts replaced to make it feel brand new, even though technically it’s not. For the most part Apple customers seem to be OK with it, except over in the Netherlands where a Dutch court has ruled that Apple cannot replace new units for refurbished one. The case started from a woman who purchased an iPad and due to problems, was entitled for a new device in which Apple gave her a refurbished unit in which she refused to accept it. According to the judge’s ruling, “A replacement iPad is, despite everything that Apple has argued about it, not a new iPad, but a replacement. Apple is not selling ‘replacements’ as new in the market.” It also seems that not only will Apple have to deal with this in the Netherlands, but a civil suit has been filed on similar grounds in California. There is a bit of debate surrounding refurbished devices and as to their status of whether it is new or used. However refurbished products tend to be considerably cheaper than brand new, and for the most part work like new, but we guess not everyone sees it that way. Filed in Apple >Tablets.

"Apple has been working with LuxVue (which it acquired in 2014) to develop new micro-LED screen production in the two years since the technology began gaining public attention in the 2015," Apple Indiser reported on Wednesday, citing a Business Korea report. Apple was granted patents related to LuxVue and micro-LED, that also explains the inclusion of sensing Infrared diodes with the ability to read fingerprints on the surface of the display. In addition to the loss of a billion dollars worth of OLED screens, Samsung and LG are also increasingly concerned that Apple will start sourcing its RAM and cameras elsewhere, too, the report noted. Aiming to secure a stable supply of memory chips for its iPhones, Apple may invest billions of dollars to obtain a substantial stake in struggling Japanese conglomerate Toshiba's chip business, ending nearly two decades of being among Samsung's largest RAM customers. Apple executives are also considering joining hands with chip manufacturer Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision, for taking a big stake in Toshiba's semiconductor business. Early this year, Foxconn announced that it is teaming up with Apple to set up a display-panel manufacturing facility in the US at an investment of $7 billion. The facility could create between 30,000 and 50,000 new jobs and could include the production of TV screens in addition to smartphone displays. Foxconn has most of its factories in China where it assembles Apple's iPhones. For the latest tech news and reviews, follow Gadgets 360 on Twitter, Facebook, and subscribe to our YouTube channel.

PHOTO/Twitter Tech giant Apple is expected to launch a revolutionary new iPhone later this year but now we may have an idea of what the actual smartphone may look like. Reputable Apple leaker Benjamin Geskin recently uploaded a picture of what seems to be a dummy of the upcoming smartphone.

However, Apple has not released any official statement on the much-awaited smartphone so far and so many of the rumours circulating on the internet may not turn out to be true.   Read more: Apple , iPhone 8 , Latest Read full story Recommended Stories Apple CEO almost kicked Uber out of app store for 'tracking former users' New York Times report claims Uber tracked former users even after they deleted the app from their iPhones Will newer companies outsmart smartphone giants like Samsung and Apple?

Fearless Muckraking Since 1993 Home Articles Recent Articles Magazine Current Issue Back Issues Subscribe Subscriber Access Subscribe Donate Archives Search Authors About JOIN LIST Books T-shirts podcasts FAQs April 26, 2017 The Looting Machine Called Capitalism by Paul Craig Roberts by Tweet Email I have come to the conclusion that capitalism is successful primarily because it can impose the majority of the costs associated with its economic activities on outside parties and on the environment. In other words, capitalists make profits because their costs are externalized and born by others. In the US, society and the environment have to pick up the tab produced by capitalist activity. In the past when critics raised the question about external costs, that is, costs that are external to the company although produced by the company’s activities, economists answered that it was not really a problem, because those harmed by the activity could be compensated for the damages that they suffered. This statement was intended to reinforce the claim that capitalism served the general welfare. However, the extremely primitive nature of American property rights meant that rarely would those suffering harm be compensated. The apologists for capitalism saved the system in the abstract, but not in reality. My recent article, “The Destruction of Inlet Beach,” made it clear to me that very little, if any, of the real estate development underway would be profitable if the external costs imposed on existing property holders had to be compensated. Consider just a few examples. When a taller house is constructed in front of one of less height, the Gulf view of the latter is preempted. The damage to the property value of the house whose view has been blocked is immense. Would the developer build such a tall structure if the disadvantaged existing property had to be compensated for the decline in its value? When a house is built that can sleep 20 or 30 people next to a family’s vacation home or residence, the noise and congestion destroys the family’s ability to enjoy their own property. If they had to be compensated for their loss, would the hotel, disquised as a “single family dwelling” have been built? Walton County, Florida, is so unconcerned about these vital issues that it has permitted construction of structures that can accommodate 30 people, but provide only three parking spaces. Where do the rental guests park? How many residents will find themselves blocked in their own driveways or with cars parked on their lawns? As real estate developers build up congestion, travel times are extended. What formerly was a 5 minute drive from Inlet Beach to Seaside along 30-A can now take 45 minutes during summer and holidays, possibly longer. Residents and visitors pay the price of the developers’ profits in lost time. The road is a two-lane road that cannot be widened. Yet Walton County’s planning department took no account of the gridlock that would emerge. As the state and federal highways serving the area were two lanes, over-development made hurricane evacuation impossible. Florida and US taxpayers had to pay for turning two lane highways into four lane highways in order to provide some semblance of hurricane evacuation. After a decade, the widening of highway 79, which runs North-South is still not completed to its connection to Interstate 10. Luckily, there have been no hurricanes. If developers had to pay these costs instead of passing them on to taxpayers, would their projects still be profitable? Now consider the external costs of offshoring the production of goods and services that US corporations, such as Apple and Nike, market to Americans. When production facilities in the US are closed and the jobs are moved to China, for example, the American workers lose their jobs, medical coverage, careers, pension provision, and often their self-respect when they are unable to find comparable employment or any employment. Some fall behind in their mortgage and car payments and lose their homes and cars. The cities, states, and federal governments lose the tax base as personal income and sales taxes decline and as depressed housing and commercial real estate prices in the abandoned communities depress property taxes. Social security and Medicare funding is harmed as payroll tax deposits fall. State and local infrastructure declines. Possibly crime rises. Safety net needs rise, but expenditures are cut as tax revenues decline. Municipal and state workers find their pensions at risk. Education suffers. All of these costs greatly exceed Apple’s and Nike’s profits from substituting cheaper foreign labor for American labor. Contradicting the neoliberal claims, Apple’s and Nike’s prices do not drop despite the collapse in labor costs that the corporations experience. A country that was intelligently governed would not permit this. As the US is so poorly governed, the executives and shareholders of global corporations are greatly enriched because they can impose the costs associated with their profits on external third parties. The unambigious fact is that US capitalism is a mechanism for looting the many for the benefit of the few. Neoliberal economics was constructed in order to support this looting. In other words, neoliberal economists are whores just like the Western print and TV media. Yet, Americans are so insouciant that you will hear those who are being looted praise the merits of “free market capitalism.” So far we have barely scratched the surface of the external costs that capitalism imposes. Now consider the polution of the air, soil, waterways, and oceans that result from profit-making activities. Consider the radioactive wastes pouring out of Fukushima since March 2011 into the Pacific Ocean. Consider the dead zones in the Gulf of Mexico from agricultural chemical fertilizer run-off. Consider the destruction of the Apalachicola, Florida, oyster beds from the restricted river water that feeds the bay due to overdevelopment upstream. Examples such as these are endless. The corporations responsible for this destruction bear none of the costs. If it turns out that global warming and ocean acidification are consequences of capitalism’s carbon-based energy system, the entire world could end up dead from the external costs of capitalism. Free market advocates love to ridicule economic planning, and Alan Greenspan and Larry Summers actually said that “markets are self-regulating.” There is no sign anywhere of this self-regulation. Instead, there are external costs piled upon external costs. The absence of planning is why over-development has made 30-A dysfunctional, and it is why over-development has made metropolitan areas, such as Atlanta, Georgia, dysfunctional. Planning does not mean the replacement of markets. It means the provision of rules that produce rational results instead of shifting costs of development onto third parties. If capitalism had to cover the cost of its activities, how many of the activities would pay? As capitalists do not have to cover their external costs, what limits the costs? Once the external costs exceed the biosphere’s ability to process the waste products associated with external costs, life ends. We cannot survive an unregulated capitalism with a system of primitive property rights. Ecological economists such as Herman Daly understand this, but neoliberal economists are apologists for capitalist looting. In days gone by when mankind’s footprint on the planet was light, what Daly calls an “empty world,” productive activities did not produce more wastes than the planet could cleanse. But the heavy foot of our time, what Daly calls a “full world,” requires extensive regulation. The Trump administration’s program of rolling back environmental protection, for example, will multiply external costs. To claim that this will increase economic growth is idiotic. As Daly (and Michael Hudson) emphasize, the measure known as Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is so flawed that we do not know whether the increased output costs more to produce than it is worth. GDP is really a measure of what has been looted without reference to the cost of the looting. Environmental deregulation means that capitalists can treat the environment as a garbage dump. The planet can become so toxic that it cannot recover. In the United States and generally across the Western world, property rights exist only in a narrow, truncated form. A developer can steal your view forever and your solitude for the period his construction requires. If the Japanese can have property rights in views, in quiet which requires noise abatement, and in sun fall on their property, why can’t Americans? After all, we are alleged to be the “exceptional people.” But in actual fact, Americans are the least exceptional people in human history. Americans have no rights at all. We hapless insignificant beings have to accept whatever capitalists and their puppet government impose on us. And we are so stupid we call it “Freedom and Democracy America.” Join the debate on Facebook Paul Craig Roberts is a former Assistant Secretary of the US Treasury and Associate Editor of the Wall Street Journal. Roberts’ How the Economy Was Lost is now available from CounterPunch in electronic format. His latest book is The Neoconservative Threat to World Order.

A new report casts doubt on the persistent rumour that Apple is working on three new iPhone handsets to launch later this year. Previously, it had been reported that Apple would launch an iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus, alongside a third, more powerful special edition iPhone 8. This third handset was reportedly in celebration of the 10th anniversary of the original iPhone, which launched back in 2007. But according to tech blog MICGadget, there will simply be two models. The blog cites “friends from Foxconn”, one of the biggest Apple suppliers and chief iPhone assembler. The Taiwanese company, which manufactures across China, is often cited as a source for Apple leaks, given the sprawling nature of its operations. According to the report, Foxconn has received an order for just two new models, rather than three. Of course, we can’t verify this information, so take it with due caution. Still, this doesn’t rule out a special edition iPhone. For a start, Apple could be placing a later order for the special edition model while it refines some of the hardware kinks, of which it’s rumoured there are many. Apple could also be releasing two special edition models – marked by the inclusion of an OLED display – rather than any bog standard LCD iPhones. It’s long been expected that Apple would shortly make the shift to OLED screens. Unlike traditional LCD displays, an OLED panel has pixels that produce their own light. This means they can display deeper blacks as individual pixels can be turned off. Also, the lack of a backlight saves power, making OLED panels much more energy efficient. Samsung has already used OLED screens on handsets for many years, so Apple is widely expected to follow suit this year. Unfortunately, we likely won’t know the truth of the matter until September, which is when Apple should be making a new iPhone announcement.

Fortune looks at how e-commerce has functioned to stem store closures. These are among today’s must reads from around the commercial real estate industry. Elaine Misonzhnik, Diana Bell | Mar 30, 2017   America is building more apartments than renters want “The US apartment market remains overdeveloped, with supply outpacing what prospective renters are asking for, especially in the most expensive segment of the market. US apartment occupancy slipped to 94.5% in the first quarter from 95.1% last fall, according to the apartment-data provider Axiometrics. Properties completed in late 2016 and 2017 are ‘scrambling’ to find their initial residents, especially in the luxury market, the firm said in a report Thursday. Over the past two quarters, demand for apartments was more than 100,000 short of the number of units that were available. ‘Apartment markets are still solid, but we knew that this would be a year when apartment supply would outpace demand,’ Jay Denton, vice president of RealPage’s Axiometrics business, told Business Insider. The company estimates that new deliveries would average 102,000 units per quarter for the rest of this year, compared to 82,000 in late 2016 and early 2017.” (Business Insider) How E-commerce Is Making Stores Relevant Again “After a tough holiday season, many big- box retailers went on a cost-cutting binge. J.C. Penney, Macy’s, and Sears all announced that they would shutter dozens of stores each as shoppers increasingly shift online. But the carnage could have been much worse. Oddly enough, it was that very shift to e-commerce—the one bright spot for most retailers during the holidays—that spared even more stores from the reject rack. The counterintuitive strategy boils down to this: If traditional retailers have any hope of countering Amazon’s dominance, it’s by using their brick-and-mortar stores as local arms of their online businesses. Whether or not that’s ultimately successful, a number of retail CEOs touted the idea during recent earnings calls.” (Fortune)  Senate banking chair wants financial rules reform by early 2018 “The chairman of the U.S. Senate Banking Committee said on Thursday he wants to pass a major piece of bank reform legislation by early next year at the latest. Senator Mike Crapo, a Republican, intends to go beyond rewriting the 2010 Dodd Frank financial reform legislation and craft a bipartisan bill that advances economic growth and capital formation, he told attendees at a Chamber of Commerce event focused on capital markets. "My hope is ... that is either late this year or early next year. I'm not looking further than that," Crapo said. Crapo's agenda is being intensely watched on Wall Street, as his committee is widely seen as playing a critical role in crafting any rewrite of Dodd Frank. That 2010 law was enacted after the financial crisis, and the industry is eager to see if Republicans now in charge of the White House and Congress can significantly relax its requirements. Some of the Dodd Frank provisions that are most contentious prohibit banks from some higher risk investments and require higher capital requirements of the biggest banks. A bill that attacks Dodd Frank directly is set to be introduced in the House of Representatives soon by Jeb Hensarling, the Texas Republican who chairs the Financial Services Committee. But that bill is seen as a tough Republican approach that may not garner enough support in the Senate to be passed.” (Reuters) Economy Watch: Demand for Student Housing Stays Strong “The outlook is good for the U.S. student housing sector, according to a report released on Wednesday by TH Real Estate. Last year, the sector attracted considerable interest: investment sales totaled about $9 billion. Looking ahead, favorable demographic trends still underpin demand for the property type. Millennials (born between 1981 and 1997) are pursuing college and post-graduate degrees in record numbers, creating a sizable demand. Also, the company reports that further opportunity for investment exists due to state budget cuts. Higher education is facing funding cuts in many states, with per student spending on higher education for 2015 remaining below that of 2008 in 47 states. That presents an opportunity for investors to provide on-campus housing stock that universities are unable to provide for themselves.” (MultiHousing News) Traders are betting against another company to capitalize on Sears' demise “As Sears nears bankruptcy, some investors are looking for ways to profit from the retailer's collapse.  In an annual report filed on March 22, the company said its operating results showed "substantial doubt" about whether it would remain in business. Sears has closed hundreds of stores and sold off assets to raise cash. Traders who bet against the company by short-selling its stock have profited as it tumbled. According to financial analytics firm S3 Partners, almost all the shares that can be lent have already been taken.

This practice of adaptive reuse has, however, become increasingly common in the apartment industry. No single reason explains this boom; it is a combination of factors. But one factor that is easy to point to is the fact that people enjoy living downtown. Renters have proven this over time by their willingness to pay more for urban core units. Without deeply discussing principles of urban geography, one can see many structures that handily lend themselves to adaptive reuse in or near downtown areas. As cities evolved, centrally located buildings that once served a non-residential purpose (e.g. mills, factories, warehouses, etc.) are now placed in areas that present attractive residential opportunities. Adaptive reuse can be a great way for developers to leverage extremely valuable but otherwise inaccessible plots of land. If a structure has been designated historically significant and therefore cannot be torn down, developers can get creative by repurposing these buildings into trendy, “hip” units that renters are willing to pay a premium for.” (Forbes) Take an aerial tour of Apple’s epic new campus as its opening date approaches “Employees of Apple Inc. are set to move into the company’s new spaceship-like, Silicon Valley corporate headquarters, dubbed Apple Park, this April. Newly captured aerial footage from a drone of the 175-acre Apple house of worship shows the project nearing completion. While some employees are set to move in next month, Apple Park isn’t expected to be completed until later this year. In total, Apple will move more than 12,000 employees there over the next six-months, while construction on non-core buildings and landscaping will continue through the summer. The 2.8 million-square-foot main building features curved class and solar panels that will enable much of the facility to operate on renewable energy. It will also include a 1,000-seat auditorium for the company to host future flagship product events. In addition to the main building, Campus 2 has an underground theater, several parking garages that are connected to the main building through a network of underground tunnels, and a 100,000-square-foot fitness center for employees.” (MarketWatch) Chetrit, Somerset seeking $500M loan for Bronx megaproject “They’re building among the most ambitious projects the Bronx has ever seen.

The South Bronx complex is slated to cost over $600 million, according to Somerset’s Keith Rubenstein, with the partnership team set to cough up between $100 million to $150 million in equity. Sources said the developers are targeting domestic lenders and hope to secure either a mezzanine loan, first mortgage or preferred equity.

(PTI File ) Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s proposed visit to Shimla seems to have resulted in a political slugfest in the state of Himachal Pradesh, which is preparing for assembly elections scheduled this year. While the ruling Congress party is demanding that Modi fulfil the promises he made to the during the 2014 Lok Sabha campaigning, Left parties have raised concern over the venue of Modi’s rally — the Ridge. Apple wars Congress is also urging Modi to raise import duties on apple so that the state’s produce can compete with imported foreign fruit that is available in the Indian markets. Apple constitutes 85% of the fruit crop of the state, and contributes significantly to the state’s economy. But foreign apple influx has been effecting domestic produce “We, being citizens of Shimla, welcome Modiji but at the same time we expect him to fulfil promises he made to people of the state,” Congress general secretary Naresh Chauhan said. “South Asian Free Trade Agreement (SAFTA) is being misused by some countries to smuggle their apple produce in India. This has been creating a glut in the market, resulting in a fall in apple prices. It’s high time that Modi fulfil his promise,” he added. During campaigning for the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Modi had promised to enhance import duty on apple. State Congress, too, had promised to triple import duty but failed to live up to its words. India imports about one crore apple boxes annually and Himachal is the second-largest apple producer after Jammu and Kashmir, which produces 20 lakh metric tonne (MT). While Himachal produces 8 lakh MT, Uttarakhand produced a little less than 1 lakh MT apple last year. Apple is the main stay of people in four districts = Shimla, Kullu, Mandi , Kinnaur and Sirmaur. While imported apple costs Rs 800 to Rs 1,200 for a 10 kilogram box, a similar box of Indian apple costs Rs 600 to Rs 1,400. Majority of the imported apple comes from China, United States, New Zealand, Australia and Chile. Further, Congress is also demanding ‘Smart City’ tag for the capital town of Shimla, which lost race to Dharamshala, the second capital of the state. “Modi promised to give impetus to tourism in the state but the Centre has not granted any tourism project to the state. We expected a lot from him when he visited Mandi last year but he did not announce anything,” Chauhan added. Apple belts in Himachal play an important role in state politics — of the last five chief ministers of the state, two (late Thakur Ram Lal and current chief minister Virbhadra Singh) are from the apple heartland i.e. Shimla district . BJP on the defensive BJP has refrained from commenting on ‘apple politics’. “Himachal is very close to Modiji’s heart. When he was in-charge of state affairs for BJP, he has visited every nook and corner of the state. I don’t think that one has to demand anything or tell him anything about Himachal Pradesh,” state BJP chief Satpal Singh Satti said while reacting to Congress’ demand . ‘Nothing wrong with holding rally on Ridge’ After Shimla deputy mayor wrote a letter to Modi urging a shift in the rally venue, district administration on Wednesday clarified that there was nothing wrong in holding a public meeting on the Ridge even as the Left-ruled MC raised apprehensions about the visit . “We inspected the Ridge maidan (ground), especially the area above water tank. No visible cracks were found over the tank,” a district administration official said. The panel also gave details about the functions held on Ridge — including swearing-in ceremony of chief minister Virbhadra Singh in 2012, New Year, Republic Day, Independence Day function, Statehood Day functions etc. The panel also said that the average footfall on the Ridge was 4,000-5,000 persons per day. Deputy mayor had shot off a letter to Modi, asking him to shift venue as “large crowd could impact the water tank beneath the historic ground”. tags Narendra Modi Modi's shimla visit apple politics Himachal Pradesh Ridge more from india Shimla-Delhi flight to give boost to Himachal Pradesh tourism Apr 27, 2017 11:29 IST SC tells govt there’s no justification for delaying Lokpal, Lokayukta appointments Apr 27, 2017 11:23 IST Is Your Couch Making You Cough?

Apple said that its first two stores in the United Arab Emirates have welcomed more than 4 million visitors since opening in Dubai and Abu Dhabi 18 months ago. It has 186-foot curved storefront and balcony overlooking Burj Khalifa and the Dubai Fountain. It also has eighteen 37.5-foot-high motorized ‘Solar Wings’ designed by Foster + Parters that respond to the ever-changing environmental conditions. When the sun is at its hottest they cool the store, and in the evenings they open to welcome everyone to the public terrace. Inspired by the the traditional Arabic Mashrabiya, each “Solar Wing” is locally fabricated from 340 carbon fiber reinforced polymer rods, and at 180 feet wide, the 18 panels make up one of the world’s largest kinetic art installations. Apple also said that it will be expanding its ‘Today at Apple’ educational sessions ranging in topics from photo and video to music, coding, art, design and more to all of its 495 retail stores around the world in May. It offers programs with more than 60 different sessions in creative skills. “This will be led by highly-trained team members, and in select cities world-class artists, photographers and musicians, teaching sessions from basics and how-to lessons to professional-level programs,” said Apple. Regarding the Dubai Mall, Angela Ahrendts, Apple’s senior vice president, Retail, said: We view our stores as a modern-day town square, where visitors come to shop, be inspired, learn or connect with others in their community. And what better place to come together than overlooking Dubai’s epicenter, where the Dubai Fountain, Burj Khalifa and Dubai Mall meet. We are so honored to have a home at one of the world’s most incredible and dynamic intersections. Regarding the expansion of ‘Today at Apple’ she said: At the heart of every Apple Store is the desire to educate and inspire the communities we serve. ‘Today at Apple’ is one of the ways we’re evolving our experience to better serve local customers and entrepreneurs. We’re creating a modern-day town square, where everyone is welcome in a space where the best of Apple comes together to connect with one another, discover a new passion, or take their skill to the next level. We think it will be a fun and enlightening experience for everyone who joins.

The already controversial Uber app was recently nearly removed from Apple’s App Store. The iPhone maker discovered that the ride sharing company was continuing to track devices even after the mobile application was deleted. According to Uber, it was secretly tracking former users in order to avoid the risk of fraud. A new report showed that the Uber app secretly tagged devices and that this tracking tag remained even when the application was removed by the user. When Apple got wind of the invasive tracking behavior, it called Uber to arrange a special meeting. At that meeting, Apple CEO Tim Cook told Uber CEO Travis Kalanick that “you’ve been breaking some of our rules” and threatened to remove the mobile application from the App Store and, therefore, iPhones, reported the New York Times. The Uber tracking tag was a part of a tool specifically meant to allow the ride share company to detect when someone who had deleted the app had re-installed it once again. According to Uber, this was created for the purpose of avoiding fraud and was necessary for that purpose. It also said it is a common practice in mobile apps. Equally, the Uber app tracking tag was in violation of Apple’s privacy regulations. Moreover, that function of the smartphone app was completely hidden from the mobile device users. This meant that not only was it not allowed by Apple, but iPhone users were entirely unaware that it was happening. The tracking tag was a type of “fingerprinting” tool that made it possible for Uber to identify the specific devices that had downloaded its ride share app. If that application was ever deleted from the device, the fingerprint was left behind. This made it possible for the company to know if the Uber application had been re-downloaded and installed on that same mobile device. The company explained that the Uber app fingerprinting tool stops devices flagged for fraudulent activity from being able to simply delete the application and beginning again.

Instead of a radical overhaul that brings ground-up updates, however, he’s suggested that the evolution might be a relatively small one. “Right now, all the phones are pretty good, all the smartphones, they’re pretty good, and it’s so hard to come up with what’s a new idea that nobody else has though of,” the Apple co-founder explained. “You might come up with some dinky feature. I like the face that, OK, on a Samsung phone you can say, ‘Smile’, click, it takes a picture from your voice. That’s cute but it’s cheesy. That’s not the sort of thing that makes a whole new product. “I think keeping the market with good products only, keeping everyone satisfied knowing that there’s so much attention being put into their experience, is all I can really think of. “I don’t think we’re going to get down to everything you do on a phone’s going to be on a watch.” GETTY While Wozniak is remaining conservative with his iPhone 8-based expectations, he’s doesn’t believe the whole smartphone market is playing it safe. Highlighting this is the Samsung Galaxy S8 and its innovative, and beautiful, new near edge-to-edge Infinity Display. According to Woz, the S8 marks a seismic shift in smartphone development. “The Galaxy S8 is going to make a big change,” he said. “What did the iPhone do? It said your whole phone can be a screen except for a couple of buttons. “Here comes the Galaxy S8 and it doesn’t even have a home button. It is all screen.” Fortunately, recent reports have suggested the iPhone 8 could adopt a near edge-to-edge display much like the Galaxy S8. It’s been suggested the Apple handset could also ditch its physical home button. As a result, the device’s integrated Touch ID fingerprint scanner could be relocated to either the rear of the handset, or beneath the screen itself. The iPhone 8 is widely expected to drop this September as one of three new Apple handsets. Launching alongside the more low-key iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus, the device, which has also been teased under the moniker of the iPhone X is expected to pair a sharper display alongside a new A11 processor and revamped iOS 11 software.

Apple was granted patents related to LuxVue and micro-LED, that also explains the inclusion of sensing Infrared diodes with the ability to read fingerprints on the surface of the display. In addition to the loss of a billion dollars worth of OLED screens, Samsung and LG are also increasingly concerned that Apple will start sourcing its RAM and cameras elsewhere, too, the report noted. Aiming to secure a stable supply of memory chips for its iPhones, Apple may invest billions of dollars to obtain a substantial stake in struggling Japanese conglomerate Toshiba’s chip business, ending nearly two decades of being among Samsung’s largest RAM customers. Apple executives are also considering joining hands with chip manufacturer Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision, for taking a big stake in Toshiba’s semiconductor business. Early this year, Foxconn announced that it is teaming up with Apple to set up a display-panel manufacturing facility in the US at an investment of $7 billion. The facility could create between 30,000 and 50,000 new jobs and could include the production of TV screens in addition to smartphone displays. Foxconn has most of its factories in China where it assembles Apple’s iPhones.

Ending so-called geoblocking is a priority for the European Commission as it tries to create a single market for digital services across the 28-nation bloc, but many industries argue that they tailor their prices to specific domestic markets. Tuesday’s vote means the European Parliament can begin final negotiations with EU member states to reach a deal on the proposal, after which it would become law. The proposal, which will apply to e-commerce websites such as Amazon, Zalando and eBay, as well as for services provided in a specific location like car rental, forbids online retailers from automatically re-routing customers to their domestic website without their consent. Amazon already makes it retail websites accessible to customers anywhere in Europe and says 98 percent of its own stock is available to shoppers from any European country. In a blow for the book publishing and music industries, European Parliament members voted to include copyright-protected content such as music, games, software and e-books in the law. That would mean music streaming services such as Spotify and iTunes would not be able to prevent, for example, a French customer buying a cheaper subscription in Croatia, if they have the required rights. The music industry has argued that extending the geoblocking ban to copyright-protected content could lead to a waterbed effect – pushing up prices in areas that are cheaper now. However, EU member states favour excluding copyright-protected services from the geoblocking ban. “Booksellers can’t be forced to sell across borders. It is a company choice, in line with the evolution of the market, and booksellers’ first concern is to keep their business afloat,” said Fabian Paagman and Luc Treutenaere, co-Presidents of the European and International Booksellers Federation. Under the proposal, consumers would be able to buy goods online even when the retailer does not deliver to their country of residence. Retailers would not be forced to deliver cross-border though, so an Italian buying a TV off a German website would have to arrange their own delivery or collect it. Consumers will also be able to take advantage of better prices for car rentals, hotel rooms or music festivals on websites in other countries, which may have previously re-routed them to their local version. “What we want is simple: to end discrimination in the single market, based on people’s nationality, residence or temporary location,” said Roza Thun, the MEP who is steering the legislation through the European Parliament.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Wednesday, 26 April 2017 | MYT 12:02 PM Dutch judge bars Apple from replacing faulty iPads with refurbished units A Dutch judge has ruled that Apple must replace faulty iPads with new models rather than refurbished models. — Reuters Apple Inc must replace faulty iPads exchanged under its Apple Care warranty programme with new products rather than refurbished ones, a Dutch judge ruled earlier this month.  On April 18, the court ruled that a woman who had a purchased an iPad 2 Air in 2015 and returned the device to Apple due to problems with its WiFi connectivity was entitled to a new device. Apple had attempted to give the woman a refurbished iPad, as the company allows for in the terms of service of its Apple Care programs, but the woman refused to accept it.  "A replacement iPad is, despite everything that Apple has argued about it, not a new iPad, but a replacement," the judge wrote. "Apple is not selling ‘replacements’ as new in the market.”  Apple sells refurbished devices through its authorised partners such as mobile phone carriers. Apple did not immediately return a request for comment on the ruling.  A civil lawsuit has been filed on similar grounds in federal court in California. The case is set for trial in December 2018. — Reuters Related Stories You May Be Interested China, Korea, US top Overwatch ranking ahead of World Cup EU lawmakers vote to make YouTube fight online hate speech Streaming helps music industry grow at fastest rate for 20 years Kaspersky tones down threat of antitrust complaint against Microsoft How to own your first home with zero down payment Save the planet with a fun day out this May Others Also Read Novelist sues actress-producer Ziela Jalil for defamation Get fit this weekend England's new Twenty20 tournament gets members' approval advertisement Latest News Anti-Putin protesters get a smartphone app to help get out of jail Locally produced children's show goes global with Netflix Not sure what to wear?

A document obtained by the news website reveals that Apple is training its drivers – before they are allowed on public roads – to be able to override the autonomous system if there is a need to do so. Three Lexus RX450h SUVs have been enlisted for this purpose, and they have each been outfitted with a Logitech G27 steering wheel and pedals – yes, the kind you’d use for a gaming console – for drive-by-wire control of the vehicles. During safety testing, the autonomous system is controlled electronically either by the installed controls, or via software. The tester onboard needs to be ready to assume control of the vehicle. In operation, depressing the brake pedal or turning the steering wheel will disable autonomous mode, although drivers can continue to accelerate without disengaging the vehicle’s self-driving function. Six permits have been applied for by Apple for the three previous-gen SUVs, and most of the drivers are PhDs specialising in machine learning and with prior experience in companies such as Bosch and Tesla, according to the report. Thus equipped, the vehicles will be able to “capture and store relevant data before a collision occurs,” Apple told Business Insider. Called the Apple Automated System, the self-driving setup in each car must be monitored by a driver who has to pass seven different tests before they are considered fully trained. Each Apple driver will have two practice runs and three trials on a private course, the report adds. Divided into three types of manoeuvres (basic, intervention and situational), the table details the various scenarios in which the Apple safety driver will have to take over control of the autonomous vehicle, and to what extent. As before, Apple remains tight-lipped on its autonomous car developments.   Open roads and closed circuits hold great allure for Mick Chan. Driving heaven to him is exercising a playful chassis on twisty paths; prizes ergonomics and involvement over gadgetry. Spent three years at a motoring newspaper and short stint with a magazine prior to joining this website.   1 Comment K Kinte on Apr 26, 2017 at 2:19 pm In Malaysia also, we need Apple staff to gain manual control of cars who have lost control due to too much nasi lemak. According to JPJ, Nasi Lemak is the No 1 cause of accidents in Malaysia Like or Dislike: 3  2 Reply   Add a comment Cancel reply You can either post as a guest or have an option to register.

The biggest of these will likely be the inclusion of an all-glass display and a revamped home button, as well as beefier hardware and larger base storage. We're also expecting this year's flagship to be the most expensive smartphone ever made by Apple, likely to exceed the $1000 mark. Apple iPhone 8 rumoured specs Release Early September 2017 Frame Stainless steel chassis, flat all-glass design Screen 5.8in edge-to-edge AMOLED display, cheaper 5.5in and 4.7in models using LCD Processor Apple A11 quad-core, running iOS 11 RAM 2GB, 3GB for Plus model Battery 'True' wireless charging up to 15ft, also wired Camera Dual lens 12MP, single lens for cheaper models Connectivity USB Type-C or Lightning  Picture above is of 2016's iPhone 7 Latest news 26/04/2017: Samsung OLED panel issues could delay iPhone 8 The iPhone 8 could be delayed because the device's component manufacturers are struggling to make new parts to Apple's high-end spec, according to the Nikkei Asian Review. The parts still missing from the final device include the display, wireless charging and printed circuit boards, sources "familiar with the company" said. Although no one has revealed who will be providing the new curved OLED screen, it's thought that Samsung could be the manufacturer in question and although the giant does have the capacity to produce the part, a supply chain source said Samsung has come across a stumbling block getting the part approved by Apple. "There might be a one to two month delay in Samsung's production of OLED panels for Apple," said Brian Huh, an analyst at research company IHS Markit told the website. "Samsung originally plans to begin churning out OLED panels in May but now the schedule will likely be pushed back to the end of June or sometime in July." Sean Kao, an analyst at IDC, added that the printed circuit boards were also causing issues. "There is a new design for a much smaller printed circuit board to allow a more powerful battery for this upcoming iPhone...but there are still some quality issue to overcome to achieve smooth mass production." However, the memory chips have already started arriving at Apple's manufacturing facility according to a memory chip executive involved in the iPhone's production. 25/04/2017: iPhone 8 release delayed until November The iPhone 8 has reportedly been delayed until October or November, because the new custom made components are taking longer to arrive than iPhone 7s parts. KGI's Ming-Chi Kuo, as reported by 9to5Mac, said the mass production of the iPhone 8's OLED screen is likely to be pushed back until October or November rather than being ready in August or September as is usually the case. Kuo said custom made parts causing problems include the iPhone's edge-to-edge OLED screen, a new Apple A11 SoC, 3D touch module and 3D sensing cameras - all significant upgrades to the iPhone. However, it's likely such a delay will have a negative impact on Apple's sales, as those due for an upgrade in September may look elsewhere for their next device. Or, they will hold fire and buy the device in 2018, which means there could be a sales slump this year compared to 2016's end of year numbers. But it's not all bad news for Apple fans, because KGI said it's likely the iPhone 7S will still launch in September, although it's a smaller upgrade and is unlikely to wow those looking for the latest tech. KGI thinks Apple's new smartphone releases, covering the iPhone 7S, 7S Plus and iPhone 8 will account for 110 million unit sales in the second half of 2017, although if the iPhone 8 is delayed by even a month, this could cause the estimations to be downgraded. 24/04/2017: iPhone 8's rear fingerprint sensor pictured in renders Last week's leaked iPhone 8 schematics have been turned into renders and the hole for the rear-mounted fingerprint sensor is very much alive. The renders, created by Instagram user bro.king, are not official, but show us what the iPhone 8 will look like if the fingerprint sensor is moved from the home button on the front to below the Apple icon on the back. It is possible these could be similar to Apple's final designs because the company tends to have a few possibilities up its sleeve, but of course, no one will know for certain until the device is launched later in the year. Another leaked photo, for example, claims to be a dummy device that will be used in stores to promote the next iPhone. Those photos look to be a completely different device, with no home button, but equally, no fingerprint sensor on the back of the phone. In fact, it looks a whole lot sleeker, with a full, edge-to-edge screen, although it looks a little plumper than the existing iPhone 7. Those pictures were revealed by Benjamin Geskin, who tweeted: "iPhone 8 Dummy (This is CNC model according to Foxconn). Back is 2.5D Glass. Matches all previous information. Long power button too." iPhone 8 Dummy (This is CNC model according to Foxconn) Back is 2.5D Glass.#iPhone8 #iPhoneX #iPhoneEdition pic.twitter.com/Z8mH7b7z4r — Benjamin Geskin (@VenyaGeskin1) April 23, 2017 These photos show an elongated power button on the side, with a very large camera on the back (although it didn't reveal whether there will be a flash sandwiched between two lenses as previously rumoured. 20/04/2017: Will Apple move the fingerprint sensor on the iPhone 8? Apple may move the iPhone 8's fingerprint sensor if new rumours circulated by known Apple tipster Sonny Dickson are to be believed. The renowned leaker has tweeted pictures of what he says are schematic drawings of the next iPhone, with the sensor on the back of the device, just below the Apple logo. According to other rumours from Pacific Crest Securities' Andy Hargreaves and Cowen and Company analyst Timothy Arcuri, Apple is apparently struggling to find a way to embed its fingerprint scanner on the front of the device with its new OLED displays, which could be a reason to place it on the back of the phone instead.  iPhone 8 looks to be taking a new direction pic.twitter.com/mG19bcDYiC — Sonny Dickson (@SonnyDickson) April 19, 2017 Dickson's leaked schematics also shows a larger camera cut-out, suggesting it will include a flash in between two lenses for taking 3D pictures and videos, or augmented reality footage as has previously been suggested. Although the current iPhone has dual lenses, the configuration is horizontal rather than vertical, as it would seemingly be on this new device. However, Hargreaves thinks these major changes in the iPhone 8's design may well cause delays for the device's launch date and be the reson behind the company launching multiple iPhones, with cheaper versions not including the same features as the flagship. 19/04/2017: Apple's reliance on curved glass and steel 'may cause iPhone 8 delays' Apple may ditch its plans to include curved glass panels and steel in the next iPhone because of manufacturing delays, a source has told Bloomberg. One design in particular was going to include "symmetrical, slightly curved glass on the front and the back," with a flat OLED screen beneath a curved glass frontage that bends round to meet a cutting edge steel frame. The source explained it's similar to the iPhone 4, which would be a great way to celebrate the phone's 10 year anniversary. However, according to the report, Apple has not managed to source the parts from its suppliers, putting a halt to those potential prototypes. "Apple suppliers have so far struggled to reliably produce heavily curved glass in mass quantities, so the company is more likely to ship the version with more subdued curves," Bloomberg explained in its report. However, the source added that Apple is testing other designs too that could have shorter lead times, such as one with a curve aluminium back rather than glass. 18/04/2017: Leaked pictures show iPhone 8 full-front display Chinese iPhone leakster KK has revealed renders of was it claims are the iPhone 8, showing an edge-to-edge screen, measuring as slightly smaller than previous leaks. The device, according to technical drawings revealed alongside the renders, will measure 137.54mmx 67.54mm, almost exactly matching the dimensions of the iPhone 7. The screen will be 5.768in diagonally, with a 4mm bezel around the sides of the smartphone. Here we go #iphone8 #iphonex or #iphoneedition pic.twitter.com/kxDDOKZ6XM — KK Sneak Leaks (@kksneakleaks) April 17, 2017 Because the device doesn't have much bezel and the screen almost extends to all edges, this means the sensors have been embedded into the screen area, rather than being integrated into a border. Although it's a pretty smart way of designing the device to make it look more streamlined, the design process must have been quite complicated to ensure the screen can still be used where they are situated. However, the renders miss vital features such as the front-facing camera and other features (such as a home button). We can't imagine Apple launching a smartphone without a front facing camera given the popularity of Facetime, raising questions around the legitimacy of these renders. On the back of the device, there's a camera with two lenses, which could help with the company's efforts in augmented reality and 3D video camera capabilities. 12/04/2017: Apple 'is struggling to integrate TouchID into iPhone 8 display' Despite an exciting number of new technologies expected from the iPhone 8, Apple is struggling to integrate it's TouchID fingerprint sensor into the display, according to a report from AppleInsider, citing analysts. "For the 5.8-inch OLED version, the biggest bottleneck remains integrating an under-glass fingerprint sensor into the display,"wrote in a note to investors seen by the publication. "The current yield rate of Apple's in-house AuthenTec solution remains low and AAPL seems unwilling to use other vendors' products." According to Arcuri, Apple has three possible options if they are unable to solve this issue. The first is that Apple could ditch TouchID altogether and rely on facial recognition, though he admits this option is highly unlikely. The second option involves moving the sensor to the back of the smartphone, much like Samsung devices. Lastly, Arcuri suggests that Apple could delay production, but announce the handset with the "iPhone 7s" series. 10/04/2017: UBS predicts that the iPhone 8 will cost less than $1,000 (£805) An investment note from bank UBS suggests that the iPhone 8 could retail at less than $1,000 - the price point previously suggested. Instead of becoming the most expensive iPhone ever, UBS believes the iPhone 8's selling price will be around $692 (£558), according to a report by CNBC. The investment bank added that the sale price of the 64GB iPhone will be between $850 (£685) and $900 (£725). This higher cost could affect Apple's gross margin, which may decline to 38.5% in the fiscal 2018 year, CNBC reported. Competitor Samsung has priced its Galaxy S8 at $720 (£580), which is cheaper than UBS's estimate for the new iPhone. However, the investment bank believes customers will pay a higher price if the hardware is innovative. Many sources seemed to think that the upcoming anniversary edition of the iPhone is going to be priced above $1,000, but UBS thinks this is unlikely as Apple rarely ventures above its competitors' high-end prices. "Apple's top model will be at a display size disadvantage to Samsung's Galaxy S8 Plus. We still think Apple will choose to price its top model relative to Samsung's top model, but remain cautious on how much higher Apple could ultimately go on price given a smaller display," analyst Steven Milunovich wrote, according to the report. 05/04/2017: iPhone 8 flexible OLED panels on order 70 million bendy iPhone 8 displays have apparently been ordered by Apple, supply chain sources have revealed. According to Nikkei Asian Review, Apple has ordered the flexible OLED panels from Samsung, ready for the device's launch in September. The 70 million figure revealed by Nikkei's source is in line with estimates by David Hsieh, senior director at research company IHS Markit. "Apple has ordered 70 million units of OLED panels from Samsung this year, while Samsung is preparing to churn out as many as 95 million for Apple in 2017, in case demand exceeds expectations," he said in a previous report. Samsung will be the sole provider of displays because Apple thinks it has the most advanced technology. As this will be the first time a curved display will be integrated into an iPhone, Apple wants to make sure it uses the best available technology. Samsung would not comment on whether it would be supplying Apple with the screens for the iPhone 8, commenting it does not reveal information about any of its customers' orders. 03/04/2017: Apple to start designing its own GPUs Apple will start designing its own graphics chips for the iPhone within the next two years, according to its UK supplier, whom Apple is cutting ties from. British chipmaker Imagination Technologies develops the GPUs Apple currently uses in its devices. According to Imagination, Apple expects to be producing its own chips in under two years, effectively ending the two companies' long-standing partnership. "Apple has asserted that it has been working on a separate, independent graphics design in order to control its products and will be reducing its future reliance on Imagination's technology," the company said in a statement. Apple has been using Imagination's PowerVR technology in its mobile devices for years, and the Silicon Valley giant is one of the British firm's biggest customers. It makes up more than half of Imagination's revenues, and the company's shares tanked by more than 60% following the announcement. However, Imagination appeared to cast doubt on the notion of whether or not Apple could successfully develop its own GPU independent of Imagination's technology, and suggested that it may consider legal action if it feels Apple has violated its rights. "Apple has not presented any evidence to substantiate its assertion that it will no longer require Imagination's technology, without violating Imagination's patents, intellectual property and confidential information. This evidence has been requested by Imagination but Apple has declined to provide it," Imagination's statement read. "Further, Imagination believes that it would be extremely challenging to design a brand new GPU architecture from basics without infringing its intellectual property rights, accordingly Imagination does not accept Apple's assertions." IT Pro has approached Apple for comment. Release date Apple has always stuck to a September release for its new smartphone flagships, and we have no reason to believe the iPhone 8 will not follow suit. This means we are likely to see a release of the device early in the month, going on sale to the public in late September. Price Given that some models of the iPhone 7 Plus can cost up to £920, it is no surprise that the industry is expecting a $1000+ price point for the iPhone 8. Rumours have suggested that Apple are planning to raise the average prices of the new iPhone range, which would make it the most expensive smartphone Apple has ever made. Rumours also point to three different configurations for the next flagship phone, two of which feature a cheaper to produce LCD screen over the costly OLED variant. This will almost certainly have an affect on final prices. Specs & hardware It's highly likely that the iPhone 8 will launch with iOS 11, but as iOS 10 has only been out a few months, its unclear what features a brand new OS would include. Apple used a quad-core A10 processor in the iPhone 7 range and the company may stick with a quad-core A11 for its next phone. Samsung's activities will not go unnoticed however, as rumours suggest they are planning for an Exynos octa-core chip built using 10nm technology. If true, Apple is unlikely to let itself be out-gunned. While the iPhone 7 was limited to just 2GB RAM, it is very likely that Apple will want to beef up the iPhone 8 to either 3GB or 4GB. Apple may also be about to phase out the 32GB storage option for this generation, according to a recent report by TrendForce, in favour of 64GB and 256GB configurations. Display One of the first rumours to circulate about the iPhone 8 was the inclusion of an all-glass OLED display. What is uncertain is whether this screen will be curved, as one report from the Wall Street Journal claimed it would be, only to be contradicted by the research report by TrendForce citing poor production yield and failed drop test results. What we can say is that this model will be its premium version, and it is very likely that two other models will hit the market at the same time offering cheaper LCD screens. On the face of things this could be seen as a move by Apple to offer greater variety and pricing options for its customers, although what is more probable is that Apple is suffering from a severe supply shortage of OLED screens. The iPhone 8 is also likely to be closer to the iPhone 7 Plus in terms of size, and although the new design will shave off some inches by removing the top and bottom bezels, the actual phone size will remain relatively the same. A number of scanners are set to feature with the new display, including a built in finger print scanner and a new iris scanner for facial recognition. Battery Apple may finally add support for wireless charging with the iPhone 8, following news that Foxconn is researching the technology for Apple devices. What this will look like is unclear, as Apple could build on the technology to provide true wireless charging with 15ft of contactless support. Although there have been no official statements, Energous, the company behind the technology, has stated it is working alongside a larger consumer electronic company planning to release a new product at the end of 2017. The research group itself has received $10 million in investments from Dialog Semiconductor, a company largely affiliated with Apple, according to BGR. 'Ultimate Accessory Connector' (UAC) A new connector type is rumoured to be making its way to iPhone 8 accessories. The UAC, which will feature on all accessories and devices made through Apple's 'Made-for-iPhone' programme, and promises to be an eight-pin connection that is smaller and thinner than USB-C and Lightning. Colours A Chinese supplier recently revealed that the new range of iPhones will feature the same colours as the current models, including Silver, Gold, and Rose Gold, according to a report by Macotakara. Although simply an uncorroborated report at this stage, the typically reliable source also pointed to a replacement to the current Space Grey option, potentially with a Deep Blue, Space Black, or a Deep Red.

"Apple has been working with LuxVue (which it acquired in 2014) to develop new micro-LED screen production in the two years since the technology began gaining public attention in the 2015," appleindiser.com reported on Wednesday. Apple was granted patents related to LuxVue and micro-LED, that also explains the inclusion of sensing Infrared diodes with the ability to read fingerprints on the surface of the display. In addition to the loss of a billion dollars worth of OLED screens, Samsung and LG are also increasingly concerned that Apple will start sourcing its RAM and cameras elsewhere, too, the report noted. Aiming to secure a stable supply of memory chips for its iPhones, Apple may invest billions of dollars to obtain a substantial stake in struggling Japanese conglomerate Toshiba's chip business, ending nearly two decades of being among Samsung's largest RAM customers. Apple executives are also considering joining hands with chip manufacturer Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision, for taking a big stake in Toshiba's semiconductor business.

Apple's plans to replace OLED with micro-LED in 2017 Apple Watch 3 and iPhones has raised concerns in Samsung as Apple's expected use of Samsung OLED screens for a new iPhone model this year may only be temporary. "Apple has been working with LuxVue (which it acquired in 2014) to develop new micro-LED screen production in the two years since the technology began gaining public attention in the 2015," appleindiser.com reported on Wednesday. Apple was granted patents related to LuxVue and micro-LED, that also explains the inclusion of sensing Infrared diodes with the ability to read fingerprints on the surface of the display. In addition to the loss of a billion dollars worth of OLED screens, Samsung and LG are also increasingly concerned that Apple will start sourcing its RAM and cameras elsewhere, too, the report noted. Aiming to secure a stable supply of memory chips for its iPhones, Apple may invest billions of dollars to obtain a substantial stake in struggling Japanese conglomerate Toshiba's chip business, ending nearly two decades of being among Samsung's largest RAM customers. Apple executives are also considering joining hands with chip manufacturer Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision, for taking a big stake in Toshiba's semiconductor business.

For their trouble, they raised their heart rates, hallucinated, and experienced involuntary open-eyed "micro-naps." It's not clear how many minutes of Clockwork Orange-style screen-staring were necessary for the pair to be immortalized as world record holders. No one has ever bothered to set a record for the "longest marathon watching virtual reality." In such cases, related categories serve as guidance. A Guinness World Records spokesperson via email told The Register, "The minimum for this particular record category is based off of research conducted by our Records Management Team which includes existing and relevant virtual reality categories and any related events." In this instance, a Berlin-based gamer's 48-hour stint playing VR games in January, 2016 appears to have provided the unofficial time to beat. VR and augmented reality (AR) systems have been the subject of major interest from tech giants like Apple, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft for several years. But sales have been disappointing. After predicting 2 million unit sales in 2016, research consultancy CSS Insight revised its prediction down to 1.2 million. Alejandro "AJ" Fragoso, a 26-year-old native New Yorker and iOS developer with contract app shop Fuzz Productions, and Alex Christison, 37, an instructor at Startup Institute and Fuzz Productions alumnus, sat couch-bound, wearing face-hugging Oculus Rift gear fed by notebook computers running event sponsor CyberLink's PowerDVD 17 software. The pair watched movies and 360-degree VR titles such as "Stranger Things | Virtual Reality / 360 Experience," "KONG VR: Destination Skull Island," and Baobab Studios' 360-degree short film "Invasion!" During the viewing marathon, Fragoso and Christison were allowed one five-minute break per hour, which accrue if unused, per Guinness rules. "Alex and I both ate with the headsets on to save up on break time," Fragoso explained in an email to The Register. "That limited our diet to mostly finger foods, sandwiches, and smoothies for the two days we were plugged in." Fragoso last year set a similar record for "longest marathon watching television," also under the auspices of CyberLink, after viewing a 94-hour non-stop stream of TV. The shorter time achieved for VR viewing, as Christison noted in Guinness World Records' post on the subject, suggests that virtual reality takes a greater mental and physical toll than actual reality, at least when not engaged in high-stress physical activity. Side effects Fragoso confirmed that his goggled marathon was unpleasant. "I'd describe the whole experience as grueling," he said. "I thought the disconnection from the world that I experienced with last year's binge watching record was bad, but it's even worse with a headset strapped on. You can sometimes hear other people in the room over the headphones but you can't see them and you don't get any sense of the time of day. Alex and I both were having visual hallucinations by the end." The pair exhibited elevated heart rates after 50 hours without sleep and neurological side effects that included zoning out ("micro-naps") and "acute hallucinations," according to Dr Robert Glatter, a specialist in emergency medicine and assistant professor at Hofstra Northwell School of Medicine, who evaluated the VR viewers. "Both participants described visual hallucinations in the later stages of the attempt, which are at least related to sleep deprivation itself," Glatter explained in an email to The Register. "The degree of hallucinations were minimal and resolved after the attempt without any adverse after-effects. Micro-naps are the brain's way of dealing with sleep deprivation and signal a transition between activity in special areas of the hypothalamus and brainstem that are integral to wakefulness and sleep." Glatter said both participants experienced minimal nausea and eye strain, noting that their occupational use of VR may have helped mitigate the side effects typically seen. "I recommend taking frequent breaks when using VR, especially for those with minimal experience," he advised. "In general, it would be wise to take a break after 30 minutes of use." Nonetheless, Fragoso pointed out that he enjoyed the VR movie experience, in short doses: "The 360 films are great but you have to keep them short because they demand so much interaction from the viewer. I imagine it would be easy to completely miss major points of a feature-length 360 movie just because you weren't looking in the right direction. That or you'd be doing a lot of rewinding." Despite the physical toll, Fragoso expressed enthusiasm for VR, which is perhaps more understandable given his involvement in software development. "In my opinion, VR games and movies are absolutely poised to become a mainstream means of entertainment," he said. "The cost of PC hardware and the VR units themselves is prohibitive but it will only get better with time, just like any new computing technology. The company I work for, Fuzz, and a number of other agencies I've visited have a suite of VR devices for employees to tinker with. The interest is there from both the developers and consumers." Glatter, as a physician, argues for more caution with VR technology. "I believe that more research is necessary as we transition to VR as the next metaverse in rapidly expanding mobile technology," he noted. "We need to study not only medical issues such as nausea, eye strain, and vestibular effects, but consider the psychological effects of prolonged immersion in such technology." "We know that VR is quite helpful for treating those who suffer from PTSD, anxiety, and depression," Glatter said. "We don't, however, want to risk adverse psychological effects associated with prolonged use of the technology. We need to practice moderation, especially in children and teens with developing brains." ® Tips and corrections 20 Comments MORE Virtual Reality Entertainment Healthcare More from The Register Virtual reality will take over the world by 2020, reckons analyst haus Psst.

"Apple has been working with LuxVue (which it acquired in 2014) to develop new micro-LED screen production in the two years since the technology began gaining public attention in the 2015," appleindiser.com reported on Wednesday. Apple was granted patents related to LuxVue and micro-LED, that also explains the inclusion of sensing Infrared diodes with the ability to read fingerprints on the surface of the display. In addition to the loss of a billion dollars worth of OLED screens, Samsung and LG are also increasingly concerned that Apple will start sourcing its RAM and cameras elsewhere, too, the report noted. Aiming to secure a stable supply of memory chips for its iPhones, Apple may invest billions of dollars to obtain a substantial stake in struggling Japanese conglomerate Toshiba's chip business, ending nearly two decades of being among Samsung's largest RAM customers. Apple executives are also considering joining hands with chip manufacturer Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision, for taking a big stake in Toshiba's semiconductor business. Early this year, Foxconn announced that it is teaming up with Apple to set up a display-panel manufacturing facility in the US at an investment of $7 billion. The facility could create between 30,000 and 50,000 new jobs and could include the production of TV screens in addition to smartphone displays. Foxconn has most of its factories in China where it assembles Apple's iPhones. --IANS anuj/vm SEARCH More from Sify: talking point on sify news Latest Features MCD elections: Even Modi relies on Kejriwal's symbol!

Titled "Today at Apple", the free teaching sessions will be led by highly-trained team members, world-class artists, photographers and musicians. The teaching sessions will cater both professional and basic level participants, Apple said in a blog post on Tuesday. "'Today at Apple' is one of the ways we're evolving our experience to better serve local customers and entrepreneurs. We're creating a modern-day town square, where everyone is welcome in a space where the best of Apple comes together to connect with one another and discover a new passion," said Angela Ahrendts, Senior Vice President (Retail) Apple. The programmes primarily focus on the features of Apple products that its customers love most, irrespective of skill levels and ages. Those interested in photography can learn shooting, organising, editing and more in six 'How to' sessions. The photography sessions for advanced photographers gives them an opportunity to learn the techniques including light and shadow, portraits and storytelling. The programme will also offer special courses for families and educators. "Teachers can come together for 'Teacher Tuesday' to learn new ways to incorporate technology into their classrooms, or aspiring coders of all ages can learn how to code in Swift, Apple's programming language for iOS and Mac apps," Apple said. Parents can also join Apple's weekend programme along with their kids to learn courses like music making and coding with robots. "Kids Hour is designed to spark imagination and creativity through fun, hands-on projects. Sessions include coding with Sphero robots, Creating Music with GarageBand and Making Movies Together with iMovie," Apple said. --IANS qd/gb/vm SEARCH More from Sify: talking point on sify news Latest Features MCD elections: Even Modi relies on Kejriwal's symbol!

Editorial Director at Mobile Nations, analyst at iMore, video and podcast host, you can follow him @reneritchie on Snapchat, Instagram, and Twitter. From 7% to 2.5% in one week flat — Welcome to the new Apple Store affiliate rate. Apple just announced via the iTunes Affiliate Newsletter that it's slashing App Store — app and in-app purchase — affiliate revenue from 7% to 2.5% effective May 1, 2017. Starting on May 1st 2017, commissions for all app and in-app content will be reduced from 7% to 2.5% globally. All other content types (music, movies, books, and TV) will remain at the current 7% commission rate in all markets. We will also continue to pay affiliate commissions on Apple Music memberships so there are many ways to earn commissions with the program. That's close to a two-thirds drop and with only one week's notice. Once-upon-a-time App Store affiliate revenue paid for a full-time app editor on iMore. It's dwindled since then, as paid apps gave way to fremium, but this, to quote our business team, is "soul crushing". We'll have to wait and see how it shakes out, but it's possible revenue will drop low enough it wouldn't even keep a full-time editor in instant coffee for the month. @natisho @reneritchie @MDMDeals No kidding it's going to hit me hard—gonna need to take a hard look at if it's worth it to run @MDMDeals anymore. Suspect I may not be 😕— Mark D Miller (@MarkDMill) April 24, 2017 Both the depth of the cut and the abruptness of the timeline are startling. A lot of websites, including iMore, have been increasingly turning to affiliate revenue to help shore up declines in ad revenue — and to get away from the more egregious ads. The same holds true for developers who have long used affiliate adds on their own apps to bolster their income. With Apple (and Amazon, by the way), slashing that affiliate revenue, it's going to make things even tougher. (Google, the other major online market, doesn't and never has offered affiliate revenue for Google Play.) So, yeah, this change in affilate commissions pretty much sucks. We don't rely on links alone (thankfully), but we'll be affected by it. pic.twitter.com/85V94DBPqQ— Federico Viticci (@viticci) April 24, 2017 While Apple initially ran the App Store at slightly above break-even, and used its 30% share of paid apps to support the huge percentage of free apps, App Store revenue has grown steadily over the years and has long since become a huge business in its own right. If the App Store were struggling, cuts would be easier to understand. But the reverse is true. That's led to the popular, if desperate, theory that Apple is doing this in advance of cutting its own revenue share from 30% down to 15% or 10% at WWDC 2017. That would explain the change, though not the abruptness. As much as that sounds like wishful thinking, it would at least reduce the pressure on developers. Though, if that was part of the reasoning, why not wait and announce the two together? Not really. Affiliates never worked for iPhone/iPad apps because of low prices anyway. https://t.co/zkoylDmqve— 👾Denys Zhadanov (@DenZhadanov) April 24, 2017 Either way, publications are also businesses and, if they can't financially justify it, they may reduce or eliminate app coverage, which would also hurt developers and customers alike. (At least for those who find app coverage valuable.) Given how out-of-the-blue this is, a lot is up in the air right now. We'll have to wait and see how it shakes out. If you're a developer or a pub that depends on App Store affiliate revenue, let me know how the change affects you. Reader comments Apple abruptly slashes App Store affiliate revenue 14 Comments View All Comments Log In to Comment Register Sort by Date Sort by Rating cuttheredwire I don't like this. I deliberately support sites like iMore and others by using affiliate links. I keep ads off due to malvertizing. I could see reducing the amount as the App Store has been making record sales, but not slashing it like this. 0 2 days ago Reply tnt4 Malvertizing... great word. 0 1 day ago Reply returnmyjedi If this is a precursor to a cut in the revenue share of App purchases then at least it'll be sort of justified. If not it just comes across as being miserly, especially as Apple have given next to no notice for it. It'll be interesting to see how App coverage is handled on Apple sites from now on. Websites covering Android often have a more balanced view of Google Play apps due to the lack of an affiliate program, whilst many Apple sites seem to push paid apps more thanks to the slice of the revenue they get. 0 2 days ago Reply user7c "Websites covering Android often have a more balanced view of Google Play apps due to the lack of an affiliate program" This behaviour would be more beneficial to the consumer no? With the newly restructured App Store review and direct developer feedback mechanism, maybe Apple wants to direct people to their own app review / feedback forum instead of other outside websites like imore. Question: How can I catch Rene's attention to this reply to solicit his thoughts on this? 0 1 day ago Reply Rene Ritchie Present! How can I help? 0 1 day ago Reply cuttheredwire Not that you need my backup, but sites that promote bad paid apps will lose readers. Sites that recommend good apps will stay afloat and buikd customer trust (insert subjectivity disclaimer). iOS gets games first and best for a reason. http://gizmodo.com/when-it-comes-to-gaming-the-iphone-will-always-stomp-... 0 1 day ago Reply user7c Hi Rene, Was just wanting your thoughts on Apple possibly planing to steer readers to their own new feedback (support with direct developer feedback) mechanism instead. PS. The reply button stopped working for me - fixed now. PS. Apple may be trying to steer away from affiliate revenue not that other large techs are not doing it either. = bad press. 0 16 hours ago Reply waynezhang Two mouth ago, Amazon have cut their affiliate commission too. 0 2 days ago Reply PoisonMaps This seems a crazy decision by Apple. Sites such as this (and several others) are great promotors of Apple’s products, so why are Apple rewarding them by slashing one of their main income streams? Such sites also have great influence on how the public perceives Apple, so why deliberately antagonise them by gouging them for money that Apple really doesn’t need? And with only one week of notice! As an independent app developer I think it It is already too difficult for the average user to discover new apps. The App Store doesn’t have anywhere near enough space to promote every decent app, so this is where third party blogs and sites come in. Without them smaller developers such as myself will have far fewer opportunities for our apps to be brought to users’ attention. It doesn’t matter if Apple reduce their commission from 30% to 0% because this decision will mean that far fewer users hear about the apps, and so far fewer will be sold, which means that everyone will lose out. 0 1 day ago Reply thundermustard The only time Rene criticizes Apple is when it cost him money. 0 1 day ago Reply Rene Ritchie I'm paid either way. So really, it's just the Apple mouse I hate. 0 1 day ago Reply cardfan Strange move. I wouldn't think referrals would be a huge percentage for Apple and they'd be happy to get them. I hardly ever view the app store without first reading an article that leads me to it. Perhaps it'll make sense after WWDC but as Rene mentions that could have waited. Makes me wonder who'd really want to partner with Apple when they do stuff like this. 0 1 day ago Reply user7c Both Rene and commenters pointed out that others like Google and recently Amazon do not pay affiliate revenue, maybe Apple do not want to be zeroed out - to avoid being accused of paying for reviews? 0 1 day ago Reply CylonJason The problem with this article is that it doesn't explain what App Store affiliate revenue is and how it works, to the average person who doesn't know. Rene is usually always good at dumbing down the technical jargon and putting things in layman terms. Can anyone explain?

When he's not bothering his chihuahuas, Mikah spends entirely too much time and money on HomeKit products. You can follow him on Twitter at @mikahsargent if you're so inclined. Putting together a smart home takes time, money, patience, and a little elbow grease. I've been building out my smart home (I'm still not entirely sold on that term) for quite awhile. I've got smart lights, smart plugs, smart motion sensors, smart fans, a smart garage door … I'll save you the time and sum things up: I've got a boat-load of smart gadgetry in my home. And as I've built things out, set up automations, cut back, expanded, swapped out products, upgraded devices, and more, I've come to realize there are a few apps, tools, and products that have made my smart home experience a delight. Whether this will be your first foray into smart home territory or you're a seasoned home automator who's just itching to expand, I've put together a list of five things every smart home owner should have to make their experience all the more delightful and all the more useful! 1. An app to control your smart home No one smart-home-product manufacturer has been successful in providing everything you need for your smart home setup. As you start to build out your automated home, you're going to be buying products from different companies and you're going to need a way to tie them all together (as best you can). If you're rocking an iPhone or other iOS device, I recommend limiting your smart-home purchases to HomeKit-enabled accessories, because you'll be able to control all your devices simply and securely with your voice (via Siri) and your iOS device (via HomeKit). If you're not rocking an iPhone (or just want to buy non-HomeKit-enabled accessories), worry not! There are some apps and services that can help you tie things together. Home The Home app for iOS is a fantastic (and simple) way to control all your HomeKit-enabled accessories. You can use the app to install new HomeKit-enabled accessories, monitor your home's status, turn on and off lights, activate scenes, adjust devices in individual rooms, set up automations, view HomeKit-enabled cameras, invite guests to control your HomeKit-enabled accessories, and more. I won't go into too much detail here on what the Home app can do and how it works because I've already done that! You can learn everything you need to know about HomeKit and the iOS Home app by clicking below: Learn more Elgato Eve Not only does Elgato make a fan-friggin'-tastic set of HomeKit-enabled smart home products, the company makes one of the best third-party apps for controlling your HomeKit home. Where iOS's Home app is a simple way to get going with your smart home, the Eve app lets you monitor and control your home in great detail and with incredible nuance. When I needed to figure out a way to have my lights turn on as soon as a motion sensor was triggered and turn off again after a certain period of time, Elgato's Eve app allowed me to do just that. The app also provides detailed information about power usage, charts contact sensor interactions, motion, and more. It's a full-featured app for a person who wants more out of their HomeKit-enabled smart home. Free - Download now Wink As promised, the Wink app is one of the apps I mentioned that can help tie various smart home products together regardless of their HomeKit compatibility. Before I had a Wink Hub 2 in my home, I was able to use the Wink app to control my August Smart Lock, Ecobee thermostat, iHome SmartPlug, Nest Cam, and Philips Hue Lights. The app provides simple, individual control of supported smart home devices as well as smart home scenes (Wink calls them Shortcuts) and automations (Wink calls them Robots). You can set up a Good Night Shortcut, for example that turns off all the lights in your home and turns up the heat on the thermostat. A Robot, on the other hand, would let you set up an automation that, say, turned on the lights in your garage as you arrived home. You won't get the same level of integration as you can with HomeKit and the iOS Home app, but the Wink app does a pretty good job of bringing together various devices all in one place. Free - Download now Home Assistant Home Assistant isn't for everyone, but it's one of the most all-encompassing home automation tools I've come across. Running on Python 3, this home automation platform auto-discovers loads of supported devices and gives you access and control as soon as you launch the system. Home Assistant is an open-source platform that's maintained by what's clearly a very committed, active community; the platform supports more than 600 components (various home automation products and services). Notably, after installing and launching Home Assistant I was able to control my Apple TV from the platform's web interface all from my phone! Some other popular components include Amazon Echo, IFTTT, Ecobee, IKEA's new home automation line, Nest, Sonos, and Plex. If you're comfortable fiddling with Raspberry Pis or digging around in Terminal, you might give Home Assistant a go — this service aims to bring together any and all of the home automation products you add to your home and it does a doggone good job at it. Learn more 2. An in-home voice assistant Siri is a fine means of controlling your smart home but nothing beats the always-on, hyper-focused devotion of an in-home voice assistant. There's something comforting about knowing you've got a means of control that doesn't need to recharge at the end of the day (or in the middle of the day if you forgot to plug in your phone the night before). These devices are tailor-made to be your virtual, voice-activated assistant and they do a damn fine job of it. I'm sure some will disagree but I hold you're not rocking a true smart home until you can reliably control it with your voice. Amazon Echo While I'm tapping away at the iOS Home app, I listen to my partner (my own personal litmus test for how normal, everyday people use technology) gleefully use Alexa to play music, control our lights and thermostat, and get the daily forecast. Amazon has stepped up in a big way when it comes to the smart home. Where Apple has chosen a rigorous, security-focused approach with HomeKit compatibility, Amazon has made Alexa integration swift and flexible. As a result, Alexa supports a whole host of smart home devices. See at Amazon If you want to learn more about the Amazon Echo or Amazon's Alexa smart assistant, you can check out all our coverage: Amazon Echo Oh! If you're not keen on giving up Siri control of your smart home devices, there's plenty of overlap between Alexa and Siri; this list has everything you need: These smart home accessories work with Amazon's Alexa and Apple's HomeKit Google Home Google Home is Google's take on the always-on, in-home smart assistant. It's tied to Google's services, of course, so if you're firmly in the Google Products camp (Gmail, Google Calendar, Android, etc.) Google Home was made for you! The beautifully designed device features some pretty powerful, nice-sounding speakers that make it a better music-listening device than the Amazon Echo, but it's still got some catching up to do in terms of smart home support. Google semi-regularly adds new smart home integrations, but its list of supported devices pales in comparison to both Apple and Amazon. That said, the device has some pretty powerful tie-ins with automation-service IFTTT; with a little fiddling you can control smart home products that you'd otherwise be unable to control. Google is skilled at taking user data and doing truly useful things with it; I expect the company will apply some of that same magic in future updates of the Google Home. See at Best Buy 3. Smart lighting I've said it before and here it is again: There's no clearer, cooler way to show off the power of smart home products than smart lighting. Every smart home owner needs to have at least a couple smart bulbs in their home, because there's no better way to sell your smart home obsession to doubters than to magically (not using a light switch) control your lights. Let the haters bask in the glory of your sunset-timed yard lights and pink-hued multicolor bulbs. Smart lights are also one of the most diverse product categories so there's plenty of room for experimentation: You can have LED strips below your cabinets, color-changing bulbs in your media room, automatic lights in your yard, dimmable recessed lighting in your ceiling — and control all of that with your voice, a mobile device, a smart switch, an automation, etc. Another reason smart bulbs make the list: Smart bulbs are among the least expensive smart home products you can buy. If you're just getting started, you can quickly build out your smart home without breaking the bank. Best Low-Cost Lights for Your Smart Home It's also worth noting smart bulbs — particularly Philips Hue bulbs — are some of the most universally compatible smart home products. When you're trying a new voice assistant, app, or service, you need something with which to test it; chances are your bulbs are going to offer more integrations than your smart lock (and that's a good thing). See at Amazon 4. A hub or HomeKit Much like the apps I mentioned before, hubs (and HomeKit) can help you tie together products from different smart-home-product manufacturers. It's a pretty crummy experience having to jump from app to app to control your smart home devices; you need an easy way to be the maestro of your smart home no matter whose brand adorns the lights, plugs, fans, and sensors in your home. HomeKit HomeKit is a framework created by Apple that lets smart-home-product manufacturers offer centralized, secure control of their devices with Siri and the home app for iOS. Apps — like the Eve app I mentioned before — can also use HomeKit to offer smart home control. While I'm a big fan of HomeKit and Apple's take on smart home control, there are still many products that aren't compatible. That's when you need a hub! Smart home hubs and HomeKit alternatives I've put together a list of the best HomeKit alternatives with compatibility information. You can learn a little bit about different smart home hubs and devices and what products they support. Best Alternatives to HomeKit Depending on the size of your smart home and the smart products you've already invested in, you might find yourself needing more than one of the alternatives I've listed — that's OK. There's no right answer (in my opinion, at least) for smart home configuration. Use the products and services that work for you in the way you want them to work. Heck, that's the whole point of having a smart home in the first place! 5. A toolbox (or a hired hand) There are plenty of smart home products that don't require complicated installation if you'd rather avoid it, but if you really want to supercharge your smart home you're going to need a little DIY magic (or a hired hand). One of my all-time favorite HomeKit-enabled smart home products is an in-wall dimming kit from Lutron. When I moved into my current home, I ran into an issue where many of the lighting fixtures featured ceiling fans with tiny candelabra bulbs, so I couldn't Philips Hue my way out of the situation. I came across the in-wall Lutron Caséta dimmers and I never looked back. I have them installed all over my house now and actually prefer them to smart bulbs. See at Amazon Installing them wasn't as easy as screwing in a bulb and flipping on a switch, though. I had to cut power at the breaker, rewire outlets, cut new holes for device boxes, troubleshoot wiring issues, etc. It was a load of fun for me, but it certainly required some research and a trip to the ol' toolbox. If you foresee yourself installing a smart thermostat, smart fans, in-wall smart lighting, a smart sprinkler system, or any other advanced-installation smart products, you're going to want to make sure you have the necessary tools on hand or call in a professional!

Editorial Director at Mobile Nations, analyst at iMore, video and podcast host, you can follow him @reneritchie on Snapchat, Instagram, and Twitter. Persisting device identification after deletion, after wiping, and hiding it from Apple — just another day in the life of Uber? Uber has been caught egregiously violating user privacy and App Store guidelines by persisting device identifications even when the Uber app was deleted and the device wiped. Mike Issac, writing for The New York Times: For months, Mr. Kalanick had pulled a fast one on Apple by directing his employees to help camouflage the ride-hailing app from Apple's engineers. The reason? So Apple would not find out that Uber had been secretly identifying and tagging iPhones even after its app had been deleted and the devices erased — a fraud detection maneuver that violated Apple's privacy guidelines. But Apple was on to the deception, and when Mr. Kalanick arrived at the midafternoon meeting sporting his favorite pair of bright red sneakers and hot-pink socks, Mr. Cook was prepared. "So, I've heard you've been breaking some of our rules," Mr. Cook said in his calm, Southern tone. Stop the trickery, Mr. Cook then demanded, or Uber's app would be kicked out of Apple's App Store. The original story used the word "tracking" which made people think Uber was persisting device location rather than device id. ID alone is still egregious though. Uber was able to do this by using private APIs, which is something expressly forbidden by Apple's terms of service. Worse, Uber deliberately tried to hide its violations by geo-fencing Apple's hometown of Cupertino, California. Unfortunately for Uber, it must have forgotten all the other Apple offices around the U.S. and the world. Something especially embarrassing for a location-based company. and there we have it! these shenanigans are likely what got Tim Cook upset with Uber (attached pics are from https://t.co/ygj739Ewvr + IDA) pic.twitter.com/BHWv6BA7PX— Will Strafach (@chronic) April 23, 2017 Uber was apparently doing it to fight abuse in China, where multiple devices were stolen, wiped, and used to fraudulently extract money from the service. Uber has every right to fight abuse but zero right to do it in a way that violates customer privacy and App Store policy. If this were a smaller, less important company, it's hard to believe Apple wouldn't have bounced their app right out of the store. The same New York Times article also alleges further privacy abuse, both on the part of Uber and of Slice Analytics. Uber devoted teams to so-called competitive intelligence, purchasing data from an analytics service called Slice Intelligence. Using an email digest service it owns named Unroll.me, Slice collected its customers' emailed Lyft receipts from their inboxes and sold the anonymized data to Uber. Uber used the data as a proxy for the health of Lyft's business. (Lyft, too, operates a competitive intelligence team.) Slice was using data from Unroll.me, a service that offered to help "clean up" inboxes in exchange for log in information that it then used to harvest user data. This is part of the reason I no longer use a personal Gmail account and don't allow any third-party service access to my work Gmail. Data is more valuable than money. If anyone is still confused by that, just look at what unscrupulous companies are willing to do to get it. I deleted the Uber app a while ago but this is enough to make me want to re-download it just so I can delete it again. (If it were safe to do so, of course.) It's not just callous, short-sighted, and unintelligent behavior on the part of Uber, it's another knife in the back of drivers, many of whom are actually liked by their customers. Just like the interface is the app to most users, the drivers are Uber to most customers, and there's not enough competition in all areas for everyone to easily switch. No idea if Uber is engaging in similar practices on Android or similarly violating the Google Play terms of service, but how much longer, and how many more abuses, must Uber rack up before serious action starts being taken?

This really has nothing to do with Google and unroll.me explicitly states what they do and how they monetize their services in their terms and conditions. They have came out and said they will clarify the messaging but it's always been there. This is Uber and Uber alone. Apple holds some responsibility here as well for the app continuing to be available. Just seems disingenuous to spread more fear about services that have nothing to do with this as well as continue to toss mud Googles direction. 0 1 day ago Reply cuttheredwire With Google, you are the product, which is what he doesn't like. He's not alone. I would pay good money to have an iCloud account with my domain name. That is the only thing stopping me from switching from my grandfathered Google Apps usage. 0 1 day ago Reply Quis89 But you know what you're getting into. He often makes it sound like Google is malicious in what they do. They aren't. I'd be fearful if I only based my views on these articles. 0 15 hours ago Reply cmdacos 100% agree and Google is crystal clear about what they do with my data. Apple is very vague yet trusted implicitly. Posted via the iMore App for Android 0 1 day ago Reply dejanh For what it's worth, Google also gives you tools to not just view the data they collect on you but also to wipe most or all of it. Yes, it's painstakingly tedious but it is there. How many others can say the same thing? 0 16 hours ago Reply GreenDize12 "If Uber's app was yanked from the App Store, it would lose access to millions of iPhone customers — essentially destroying the ride-hailing company's business. So Mr. Kalanick acceded." Oh stop!! Sure this will essentially happen but getting the app pulled from the App Store is more of a slow death than a bullet to the head, like this guy makes it sound. 0 1 day ago Reply cuttheredwire A company that lost billions last year would instantly lose a lot of business. On top of that, iPhone is the premium market. I cannot say which makes more, the more common Android or the more willing to pay iOS, but neither is a small market. Add to that the increase in revenue to their competitors and the difficulty to acquire future funds to burn through… you get the idea. 0 1 day ago Reply GreenDize12 That's assuming everyone just simply deletes the app the second it's pulled from the Apple Store, in which people like me won't, and are still able to use it. I'm still able to use apps that got the boot from the App Store, but I'm gonna hate upgrading since it'll finally mean the death of those apps in my circumstances. Again, just cause an app gets pulled doesn't mean it'll stop working, unless Apple really wants to take that extra step and pull the master Switch on the app and remotely disable. Not sure if they would go that far. 0 17 hours ago Reply returnmyjedi I'm more concerned with Apple's behaviour here than Uber's, the latter being a truly despicable organisation in every aspect of their business practices. Such an egregious violation of the App Store rules should have resulted in the App being pulled (a punishment many smaller apps have been subjected to). However due to Uber's size and user base Apple aquiesced and showed that their zero tolerance policy towards privacy violations doesn't apply to everyone. 0 1 day ago Reply DanRJones91 ^^ Bingo 0 1 day ago Reply cuttheredwire I agree with you on principle, but users would have been ******. Lots of them who need to get to work. Warning would have needed to have been given. Uber probably had couple days to fix the issue, or else that. And that's why Cook did it in person. Otherwise the lawyers could have handled it. I still would have liked to of seen the app pulled yet left to work with a day or so notice. It still would have caused problems, but far fewer. I think they needed the slap on the wrist. Removing it forever would **** off a lot of people and make some of them switch to Android, and get tracked anyway. The market needs competition, and that would not build it. Just too many down sides, much as I hate to admit it. 0 1 day ago Reply jsanakonda "Lots of them who need to get to work" - Really??? How did they manage before Uber? Addiction to tech...really bad thing. 0 1 day ago Reply cuttheredwire They waited longer to take buses, asked/inconvenienced friends, rented cars, and all sorts of pain in the but things. I own a car, so I don't need Uber or Lyft, but people *love* them because they are more convenient than cabs and cheaper than car rentals in my area. 0 1 day ago Reply GreenDize12 What the **** does looking for a ride have to do with tech?? So an app on my phone makes a bit easier for me to pay some d'bag that runs red lights and drives 30-40 MPH above the speed to get me to point B. It's not the tech I'm addicted to, it's the service itself. The only thing the tech may do here is make me lazy, as I either don't wanna use my car or not in the mood for public transit. Uber's app getting pulled though can mean a huge pay day for Lyft though. 0 17 hours ago Reply cmdacos The best thing to come from this whole ordeal (if you even care about this which I don't. I love Uber and use it frequently), is that we just need to geofence all apple offices to override their rules.

By Rene Ritchie Tuesday, Apr 25, 2017 at 1:00 pm EDT 9 Comments Is Apple Watch worth it? From fitness to Apple Pay, notifications to home automation, here's what you need to know before you buy! Updated April, 2017: Pros and cons updated to reflect all the latest hardware and software features. These days, you need a computer that fits in your pocket. That's what makes iPhone so popular. You probably also still need a computer for your lap or your desk. But a computer for your wrist? That feels more like an accessory at best, and extravagance at worst. Yet Apple Watch has a few features that can make it indispensable. Whether you should get an Apple Watch or not comes down to how compelling any of the main features are for your lifestyle, either by themselves or when combined together. Those features include not only timekeeping but health and fitness tracking, notifications and communications, Apple Pay and HomeKit automation. Put simply: The Apple Watch is the shuttlecraft to the iPhone's starship. Most of what you can do on Watch you can also do on iPhone — but not as conveniently. And convenience can be a killer feature. For timekeeping For notifications For health and fitness For Apple Pay For communication For remote control Who should get an Apple Watch? Who shouldn't get an Apple Watch? For timekeeping It's not an uncommon story: You stopped wearing a watch because your iPhone had a big clock right on the Lock screen, only a pocket- or bag-pull away. It's the old single- vs. multi-tasker debate, and why convergent devices like the iPhone proved so popular to begin with. The Apple Watch is also a convergent device, and that convergence can be seen in every aspect, including how it tells time. When you want to see the clock on your Apple Watch, you don't have to dig into your pocket or reach for your bag. You simply turn your wrist, the screen lights up, and you can view the time and date. It can be just that simple or, in the grand tradition of timekeeping, you can add "complications". The Watch's faces range from minimal to chronometer to utilitarian to motion graphics to astronomy to, well, Mickey and Minnie Mouse. Each face also includes a number of complications which offer even more data, if you want to enable them. Complications can include features as subtle as a monogram for personalization, but also world clocks, alarms, a stopwatch, the weather, sunrise and sunset, activity levels, phases of the moon, upcoming appointments, and stock quotes. You can have complications for your apps as well, so you can see your ETA, access your voice recorder, see sports scores, measure your activity, or even tell how much distance is left before your Pokémon eggs hatch. (Seriously.) If that level of efficiency is intriguing to you, the Apple Watch might be just intriguing to you. For notifications You already get notifications on your iPhone. You can tell when they come in thanks to the beep, buzz, or bubble on your Lock screen. With the Apple Watch, however, those notifications can appear on your wrist, sending you a subtle tap that doesn't even light up the display unless you turn the Watch to signal your interest. Then, you only get a short summary of the information, providing the app name along with a brief bit of context. From there, you get to decide if you want to stop what you're doing and view more. There's also a Notification Center, just like on iPhone, so you can swipe down and glance at everything and anything that's come in and quickly see what's happening and what, potentially, you need to take care of. And you can do it without reaching into your pocket or bag. Facebook messages, turn-by-turn directions, airplane boarding passes, coffee cards, and other app interactions can benefit from being more easily accessible. If that appeals to you, Apple Watch might appeal to you. For health and fitness Apple has recently re-focused Watch marketing around health and fitness and it's no mystery as to way. With a heart-rate monitor built-in, and GPS on the Series 2, Apple Watch makes for a compelling exercise and wellness companion. You automatically track all the basics, including standing and moving around as well as exercise, steps, and stairs. There's also a Workout app that's been specifically created to track your walks, runs, rides, rolls, and more. With improved water resistance and GPS on Series 2, you can even track your swims and get detailed maps of your routes on land and sea. With Activity Sharing, you share your achievements with the people closest to you. That way, when you reach a goal or they do, you can send a message or emoji to encourage them. Or to trash talk them. Whatever works for you. Strava, Nike+, RunKeeper, and most other, popular excercise apps have extensions for Apple Watch as well. So, you get to add the convenience of Apple Watch to whatever system and community you're already involved with. If any of those features could help you live a healthier, fitter life, the Apple Watch might be all the help you need. For Apple Pay Apple Pay on Apple Watch is magic. Instead of having to fumble for your wallet or even your iPhone, or worry about dropping your tap-to-pay card can paying for someone else's gas or burger, you simply press a button on your Apple Watch, hold it close to the terminal, and you're done. What makes it so great is that it's always right there on your wrist, it never reveals your real credit card number or personal information, and if it loses contact with your skin (via the heart rate monitor), it shuts off so no one else can use it. In many countries, tap to pay is already ubiquitous. In the U.S., it's still rolling out. If you have a lot of tap-to-pay near you, though, Apple Watch is compelling. For communication Apple Watch has basic phone and messaging built right in. Which makes it feel like something straight out of science fiction. It's incredibly convenient, especially if you have a bigger iPhone you typically leave on a table or in a bag. When any call or message comes in, rather than scrambling for it, you can simply glance at your wrist. For short conversations or replies, you can talk or text right from your watch. For longer communications, you can start on your watch and smoothly transition to your phone, or you can just go get your phone once you see who's calling and messaging on your wrist. You can even dictate or hand write short messages on Apple Watch, which makes it remarkably effective for quickly communicating on the go. If keeping in touch matters to you, the Apple Watch just might be the right touch for your wrist. Remote control The Apple Watch will let you control your Apple TV. It'll also let you remotely access your iPhone's camera, and thanks to Siri and HomeKit integration, it can even control the lights, thermometer, blinds, fans, and other connected devices in your home. The possibilities for the Apple Watch are boundless. Not only does it mean never having to get up to turn off your lights, it means not even having to reach for your phone. You can adjust anything in your setup, right from your wrist. Who shouldn't get an Apple Watch If you don't like watches or already have a traditional watch you'd never want to take off, if you're fine reaching for your iPhone or don't have an iPhone at all, or if you simply want to wait for a future generation to see where wrist computing goes, you probably don't want or need an Apple Watch. Who should get an Apple watch If you want to spend less time on your iPhone and more time out and about, if the idea of super-convenient tap-to-pay and fitness tracking appeals to you, if you want to be able to glance at a call or message before deciding whether to reach for your phone, or you simply want to experiment with the future right now, today, you probably want to try out an Apple Watch.

Also remember: You can go into an Apple Store, if you have one nearby, and try Apple Watch out. You can even buy it, use it in your daily life for a week or so, keep it if you love it, and return it if you don't. Either way, let me know what you decide in the comments below!

Being able to see notifications and information on your wrist sounds like a gimmick when you can just pull out your phone, but the incredible amount of convenience that brings really makes a difference. One thing I really like as well is that the taptic feedback when you get a notification is really easy to feel, whereas I can often miss notifications when my phone is on silent and just vibrates in my pocket. The device takes a small bit of learning to control properly at first but you very quickly get the hang of it. The only downside I have with it is that I wish it had an always-on display instead of having to lift your wrist, especially considering that it doesn't always work (albeit it does work 90% of the time) 0 1 day ago Reply cardfan Pretty much what he said. Some notifications I need immediately and I usually always get that with the watch. That alone has paid for itself multiple times. I'd like an always on display as well. Airpods really turn this into the ipod on the wrist we always wanted. Also wouldn't mind having a watch that was just communication, music, cellular, facetime, better speaker...those things vs the health stuff I don't really use. I get plenty of exercise and what not, but I just have no interest in using the watch for it. I'm still not sure I like watchOS 3 over the previous version. Hopefully Apple continues to tweak it. 0 1 day ago Reply waynezhang In my eyes, the answer is simple: If you have enough budget, Then get one. It worth to try. 0 1 day ago Reply Loren Sims I've been debating this a lot recently. Just got a sizable inheritance so I can now afford one, but do I really want one? I used to say I'll get one when I think I deserve one. Last Christmas my sister gave me a watch, first I've had for several years. I guess I'm with the 'let's see what they come up with next' group. The watch I have is a 'Ministry of Silly Walks' watch with the John Cleese character on the front. The position of his legs tells the time and his cane is the second hand. I'll buy an Apple Watch when it will do what this one does: It makes me smile every time I look at it! 0 21 hours ago Reply jayzero76 i always wear a watch. casio swatch pebble and an apple watch. since i travel a lot i use the apple watch every day. do i like it? yes or no. it really depends what you do with it. if you just check your messages or weather. even if you wanna use it for fitness they are cheaper options and even better. so just think about when you buy one is it worse spending 300-500$ to reply to messages? 0 17 hours ago Reply Fred Stein Waterproof and GPS are the big deal. You can go to the pool with kids or go for a run and leave the phone at home or back at the hotel room - safe and secure. Later when hands are filled with kids, groceries, luggage, garden tools, dirty dishes, or whatever, a glance connects you to everything. 0 12 hours ago Reply jgcaldwell The photo under the "Timekeeping" section shows seconds in the digital readout. Is that feature available in a beta version of iOS? Alex Lindsay on Mac Break Weekly has clamored for this feature and so have I. This picture is the first I seen of a "digital second hand." 0 12 hours ago Reply James Hauser I would like a stripped down version of the watch. No apps, no tracking. Just an always on clock that gives me notifications of calls and texts, with maybe a brief glimpse at the text. And it would have to be much more comfortable. I cannot stand having metal, glass, or hard plastic touching my skin all day. 0 11 hours ago Reply Maurice Lewis It's a low price to get in on the Apple Watch goodness.

Sling TV — Everything you need to know! By Luke Filipowicz Monday, Apr 24, 2017 at 5:08 pm EDT 2 Comments What to know if Sling TV is right for you? Here are all the FAQs with answers! Sling TV is a TV streaming service that you can access on Apple TV, iPhone, iPad, Android tablets, and plenty of other devices. If you're looking to join the growing number of people cutting the cord to the big mean cable companies, Sling TV is a pretty reasonably priced option to help reduce your entertainment bill. You probably have some questions about how Sling TV works, and we've got the answers! What's new with Sling TV? If you use Sling TV on your Apple TV, we have good news for you! Sling TV will be introducing its cloud DVR feature to the tvOS app. According to the Sling TV announcement you can purchase 50 hours of DVR storage for just an extra $5 per month on top your monthly subscription rate. Sling TV outlined and described the new features in its announcement this morning. " Watch anytime, anywhere– Record your favorite programs and watch whenever you want across all Amazon Fire TVs and Fire tablets, Android mobile devices, Android TVs, Apple TVs, Roku streaming players and Roku TVs. AirTV Player is not currently compatible with Cloud DVR. Conflict-free recording– Record multiple programs simultaneously, and forget about recording conflicts. Keep recordings as long as you want– With Sling TV, your recordings won't expire as long as you remain a Sling TV subscriber with Cloud DVR. Auto-managed recordings– Sling TV will make room for new recordings by deleting your old recordings as you reach capacity, starting with your oldest 'watched' recording, so you can binge on your new favorite show." What is Sling TV? Sling TV is what we call an "over-the-top" — OTT for short — service. In layman's terms that means it's an internet-based service, so you won't have a dedicated cable box or a line coming in from a cable company. Sling TV, much like its name implies, is a way to stream live TV content, meaning it shows TV programs as they are broadcast and typically not on demand like other popular services such as Netflix or Hulu; however, there are some channels that do offer content on demand — like Syfy — and certain content providers offer Sling TV as a sign-on option. How does it work? When you download the Sling TV app on your Apple TV, iPhone, and iPad, you'll need to sign up for a subscription. The subscriptions are month-to-month and vary in cost depending on which channel package you choose. How much does it cost? They are three base subscription packages. Sling Orange, Sling Blue, and Sling Orange + Blue, the base prices for each package are $20, $25, and $40 respectively. Which channels are included? The Sling Orange subscription comes with the 30 channels listed in the screenshot below. The Sling Blue subscription comes with the 40 channels listed in the screenshot below. The Sling Orange + Blue subscription comes with 50 channels listed in the screenshot below. Are those the only channels available? No. There are plenty of small channel bundles you can add-on to any subscription for an extra fee — typically $5 or $10 a month — and you can also pay extra for premium channels like HBO and Showtime. A few examples of the add-on packages you can purchase are in the screenshots down below. A full list can be found on the Sling TV website. < Will there be commercials Yes. Just like regular cable, there will be commercials, and you'll only be able to skip them if you have recorded the program on the cloud DVR. Can I get Sling TV in my country? Unfortunately, right now Sling TV is only available to residents of the United States. How fast should my internet be to use Sling TV? Sling recommends download speeds of 25/mbps to achieve the highest video quality using Sling TV. Can I cancel my subscription at any time? Yes. There is no contract to use Sling TV, as it's a month-to-month service. If you choose to cancel your account, the billing will cease immediately. Is there a free trial? Yes. Sling TV offers a 7-day free trial, meaning you can cancel your subscription anytime during those seven days and not be charged with anything. Are there any deals? Sling TV does offer a few fantastic deals to help get you started! Right now, there are two: Get a free Roku Express when you prepay two months of Sling TV. Get 50% off the Roku Premiere+ when you prepay three months of Sling TV. How to I sign up? Head over to the Sling TV website and follow its easy sign-up process!

With the AirPort Utility! Need to setup a secure no-nonsense Wi-Fi Access point? Apple has you covered. Depending on your level of computer Gung-Fu, setting up a Wi-Fi access point with proper security might seem a little intimidating. Thankfully, Apple's Airport Base Stations can take some of the edge of, thanks to the built-in AirPort Utility. How to set up your AirPort router Plug your Airport Base Station into a power outlet. Connect the modem provided by your Internet Service Provider (ISP) to your AirPort Extreme using an Ethernet cable. Use the- wire to the bottom-most port on the back of the AirPort Base Station. (Don't worry if you make a mistake. You'll be prompted to fix things, if needed, during set up). Launch AirPort Utility on your Mac. Click on Other WiFi Devices in the upper right corner. Click Other Options to setup the AirPort for additional capabilities. Select Create a new network Click Next. Enter a Network Name and a Base Station Name. (You can leave them as is or change them to whatever you prefer.) Enter your preferred Password. You can choose to have one password for both your Wi-Fi network and to configure the AirPort itself by checking Use a single password. (I recommend you have separate passwords for added security.) If you purchased a Base Station with an internal hard drive — i.e., a Time Capsule — you can also choose a separate password for that by checking "Secure disk with separate password". Click Next. If your Airport has the option for Enabling a Guest Network you can enable that option here (see below, start at step 5) Click Next. Click Done. How to create a guest network on your AirPort Base Station If you have frequent visitors and don't fancy the idea of giving them your AirPort password, you can create a Guest Network for them to connect you. This gives your friends, family, and associates a working Wi-Fi connection but also gives you some security. Launch AirPort Utility on your Mac. Click on your Base Station at the bottom. Click on Edit. Click on the **Wireless* tab at the top. Check Enable Guest Network. Enter a new Network Name. The guest network name should be something easy to discern from your regular "secured" network. Select your desired level of Guest Network Security. Choose None if you want it completely open, WPA2 if you want it secure. If you have decided to have WPA2 Personal as your security level, enter your Guest Network Password and verify it. Click Update Restart your Base Station. If you wish to protect your network from general access WPA2 Personal offers a good level of encrypted connectivity. You may want to provide an open access point if you want people to connect to your network without a password. You can select None to do just that. You should avoid WPA as that encryption level is easily compromised. Any questions setting up your AirPort Base Station? Your AirPort Base Station will reboot and you can then start connecting your various Wi-Fi capable devices to your new access point. Depending on your requirements, you may be satisfied with the network coverage your single Airport provides you. However, if you require better coverage or own a multi-storey dwelling, you may need to extend your network by installing additional access points in a configuration called bridged mode. Stay tuned for our article on how to do just that. If you have any comments or questions about setting up your AirPort Base Station leave them in the comments below!

On 21 April, Australian Federal Court Justice Moshinsky ruled that the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) should be able to serve court documents on Apple US in the United States over allegations the company engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct in Australia. The move comes just weeks after the ACCC revealed it had commenced legal proceedings against the California-based tech giant and its local subsidiary, with the industry watchdog seeking pecuniary penalties, injunctions, declarations, compliance program orders, corrective notices, and costs against Apple. Proceeding were subsequently brought against Apple Pty Ltd, the company’s Australian corporate entity, as well as Apple Inc (Apple US), its US-based parent company. However, while the ACCC has served the originating application and its statement on Apple Australia locally, according to Federal Court documents, Apple US has not provided an address for service in Australia, even though court documents have been provided to a senior lawyer at Apple US. Consequently, the ACCC sought leave to serve the court documents out of its jurisdiction in Australia, on Apple US in its home country. In a decision dated 21 April, Moshinsky ruled that it is appropriate to give the ACCC leave to serve the court documents on Apple Inc in the US, out of jurisdiction. “It is proposed to serve the court documents in the USA,” Moshinsky stated. “The proposed method of service is to use a private service agent retained through a firm of lawyers based in San Francisco. According to Moshinksy, the ACCC has a “prima facie” case for the relief claimed against Apple US in the proceeding. “There are two aspects to the case brought by the ACCC against Apple US,” Moshinsky said. “The first aspect concerns an alleged false or misleading representation by Apple US on the Apple website. “The second aspect of the ACCC’s case against Apple US is as follows. It is alleged that Apple US is liable for certain conduct of Apple Australia on the basis that Apple Australia engaged in the relevant conduct both on its own behalf and on behalf of Apple US. “In my view, it is appropriate in the circumstances to make such an order…the allegations against the respondents are closely intertwined. It is desirable that the claims against both respondents proceed together in the one proceeding,” he said. The substance of the ACCC’s claims against Apple Australia and Apple US revolve around claims the companies made in relation to a fault, known as “error 53”, experienced by some iPhone and iPad users from September 2014 to at least February 2016, which rendered their devices inoperable. The error 53 software fault occurred when those iPhone or iPad users attempted to update the iOS software on their device by connecting their device to Apple iTunes through a personal computer, according to the ACCC’s application. “Apple US represented that iOS8 and iOS9 would improve the functionality and performance of iPhones and iPads,” the ACCC’s concise statement supporting its application said. “When the iPhone or iPad users downloaded, and attempted to install, iOS8 or iOS9 on their device by connecting it to Apple iTunes through a personal computer, an error message appeared on Apple iTunes stating that the device could not be restored, and the device had stopped functioning. “This occurrence was commonly referred to as ‘bricking’,” it said.

On 18 April, the court ruled that a woman who had a purchased an iPad Air 2 in 2015 and returned the device to Apple due to problems with its Wi-Fi connectivity was entitled to a new device. Apple had attempted to give the woman a refurbished iPad, as the company allows for in the terms of service of its Apple Care programs, but the woman refused to accept it. “A replacement iPad is, despite everything that Apple has argued about it, not a new iPad, but a replacement,” the judge wrote. “Apple is not selling ‘replacements’ as new in the market.” Apple sells refurbished devices through its authorised partners such as mobile phone carriers. Apple did not immediately return a request for comment on the ruling. A civil lawsuit has been filed on similar grounds in federal court in California. The case is set for trial in December 2018.

The iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus may not deliver super screen resolutions, but they hit the right notes for many buyers and with iOS 10 there are even more reasons the iPhone is better than Android for many users. iPhone competition includes the Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge, One Plus 3, the LG V20 and other phones that deliver a bigger challenge for Apple — but there are still places where the iPhone is clearly better than Android and iOS 10 is better than Android Nougat. Many of these could change with the Galaxy S8 and the LG G6 later this year, but for now – iPhone has an edge. You need to learn what the iPhone does better and how Apple delivers a better experience than Android to see if an iPhone is the best smartphone for you in 2017. Here are 15 reasons the iPhone is better than Android phones in 2017. Use our list of reasons the iPhone is better than Android to figure out which new smartphone you should buy this year. Read our iPhone 7 review to learn what sets this phone apart from the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus. You can buy the iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus at a discount with the best iPhone 7 Black Friday deals. Read: Siri Tips & Tricks Even if you think you know which phone is best, you might be surprised to learn about all the reasons the iPhone is better than Android. iPhone Apps Are First and Better Looking Most of the popular apps are on both platforms, but many top games and apps still come to iPhone first. We’re seeing more apps come to both Android and iPhone at the same time, but there are still way more iPhone only apps that we see than Android only. When apps are available on iPhone and Android we still often see a better design on the iPhone version than on Android. This is something that still rings true in 2017. For example, we still see some new Snapchat features and Spotify features come to iPhone before Android. iPhone owners are enjoying Super Mario Run, but the Super Mario Run Android app is still on the way. Read: Best iPhone Apps Apps are an area where the gap is closing, but the differences still exist and are noticeable. We also see Apple take better care of the App Store. Recently they purged 47,300 apps from the app store that were simply bad or abandoned. Fast iPhone Updates for All iPhone owners enjoy quick and regular iOS updates for the iPhone no matter what carrier they use. Faster updates are available for all iPhone owners. Android updates take months to arrive on all the devices. After an Android device is 18 months old, you may need to wait for a new Android smartphone to get the latest software. Apple delivers iPhone updates to devices that are three years old. Apple offers iPhone 4s iOS 9 support. It is unheard of to see support for an Android phone that old. iOS 10 is available for the iPhone 5. When you look at Android devices support ends much faster. Google promises at least two years for Nexus devices, which means Nexus 6 support ends this fall and the Nexus 6P in September 2017. Google may push farther out, but it is not a guarantee. Other Android device manufacturers don’t typically match the longevity of iOS updates. On top of the added update support, Apple does not allow carriers to hold up the updates. As soon as the update is available from Apple it is available on every carrier. If you really want Android Nougat, you may need to simply buy a new Android phone. Works Great with All Your Devices If you own an iPhone, iPad and Mac your information flows smoothly from one device to the other. You can quickly sync photos to all of your devices, answer a phone call on your iPad or Mac and send text messages from your other devices. There is also support for Handoff that allows you to start a task on your iPhone and continue on your iPad or Mac. The iPhone works great with the iPad and Mac. Overall the connectivity between these devices is something Android doesn’t yet match without relying on a collection of third-party applications and services to hodgepodge together a similar feature. Sharing a file from your iPhone to your Mac is also faster and easier thanks to AirDrop. This built-in service sends the file wirelessly directly to the Mac, even when there is no other WiFi around.

You simply can’t go wrong. I own an iPhone 5, iPad Mini 3, MacBook Pro, iMac, and Apple TV. I would not even consider anything else, especially something from that “G…” company which I abhor. I won’t even use their search engine. Same goes for anything from that software manufacturer that, well, just call it “MS). Try calling any other manufacturer for support and see if you can understand what they are saying. I suppose I am bias toward Apple but after nearly 30 years of dealing with computers of all sorts I guess my opinion is warranted. 07/17/2015 gabe Reply why people like iphones? I never understood why anyone would like to give control to another company of what you do with their device. why force u to follow MEDIA SHARING and digital rights media? you cannot torrent on iPhone, nor transfer music and videos without ITunes or a paid online service in iOS. I hate that Samsung s6 tried copying apple iPhone. no microsd slot and integrated battery. CMOn! 04/06/2016 Sai Reply You ever used apple ? 07/05/2016 greentoe Reply http://gtoe.me/l/7A0q-A-04r 02/27/2017 david Reply yea 03/31/2017 bitchmaster64 Reply You don’t know me, but my name’s Sai. I’m just the O’Hare delivery guy. But it seems like trees might be worth a try, so I say let it grow. 04/19/2017 joshua millsap Reply They don’t allow you to do things like torrenting and music sharing because its against the law. why on earth would you want to steal? Also SD cards are historical flawed systems of storage for phones. 03/04/2017 Evie Reply It is simply the portability. I have watch ,I go to the gym. I have apple computer and I can receive my phone calls there and iMessages. It crashes less often than microsoft does. I can contact apple support, whenever I want. The other time ,the bluetooth in my iPhone did not work, I contacted tech support midnight and they were available. We could not fix the problem. They called me the next day and told me to go to the nearest store and pick up a brand new phone. One more thing, my iPhone was out of warranty for 165 days. They told me they cared about customer satisfaction. When I called microsoft in order to talk to me they wanted $250. Now, compare 12/02/2015 Zombieknight Productions Reply You’re literally so idiotic that you can’t spell the full name of a company. Only Apple, cuz you’re an I sheep. You can go very wrong. If people were smart these days, they would understand that iPhones are unequivocally not the right choice for them. You wouldn’t recommend anything else, because it is too limited and unintelligent to use anything else. Stop trying to influence other people to buy garbage phones and devices 05/12/2016 Nancy Reply Why are u being a hypocrite calling someone idiotic for not knowing how to spell the company name right when some of ur sentences don’t even make sense. Apple doesn’t have any competition be used it is the best phone to get. 07/13/2016 Rona Reply First of all, don’t criticize someone for calling someone else idiotic when you can’t even use proper spelling or grammar. Second, Apple is all marketing. There is nothing special about it. Android offers phones that have expandable memory (and guess who doesn’t?) and better high-speed data services. iPhones die extremely quickly, you can’t use iTunes on any other devices, whereas Android platforms are available on all devices, the picture quality on an iPhone is pathetic compared to Androids, and Apple products are majorly behind in technology. The latest update for an iPhone came out two years ago for an Android. Apple has a set array of things it can do, and you can’t customize or change that. But if you want a high-end technology phone, choose an Android. It does so much more and you can customize and change its features. I have had both an iPhone and an Android phone. 09/14/2016 Abhishek well,mam i am an android user and i would like to say that iphones are the best because when you buy an android first it will give you good performance but after one month it will start hanging and work slow and that is same with every android devices.and their are so many android malware which also affect performance. Iphones are the best, secure and stable. 09/15/2016 Me Stay butthurt, loser ; ) 12/04/2016 jgames “nothing special about it” fastest phone ever 3d touch very good camera looks very nice “nothing special about it” why do we need expandable memory on iOS? gime a few reasons for that. “better high-speed data” give me your source for all this information. iphones die extremely quickly? how? do you even have an iphone? iphones have much better standby and screen on time with heavy usage than android. you cant use itunes on other devices, yes, but ios wants to keep it ios exclusive because their services are one of the major selling points for them. android platforms are available everywhere, but google software is usually preferred to ios software. pathetic picture quality? wut? iphone pictures wont lose quality when you zoom in and support much more colors than any old android camera. android cameras are very nice as well, though. “apple are behind in technology” a lot of people say this but it’s actually quite the opposite. 3d touch was very innovative, its like a ‘right click’ for your phone. the latest iphone update did not come out 2 years ago. you seem like you have no idea what you’re talking about and just spouting nonsense. apple can do a lot of things without customization, but what customization do we really need? people always saying android is more customizable but never give examples, and when they do its “homescreen.” moving home screen icons around is a pretty useless feature tbh android isnt more high end tech than iphone and i dont see how much more it does. you havent even explained how it can in your comment. so please use common sense before spouting nonsense 02/27/2017 Gage iPhones are by far the better phone. I’ve had android phones for most of my life but i bought an iPhone 6 about a year ago and now I have the 7 and I can’t imagine going back. Android is slow, every button you push there’s a lag before it actually opens the app or whatever you pushed. Also, every android I’ve ever had has had terrible battery life, it never lasts the full day but my iPhone almost always does. And my last point, android automatically installs like 10-20 on your phone that you cannot delete no matter how hard you try. Apple has 3-5. Yes, android has a port for SD cards, but what good is that if a large amount of your memory is made up of apps you don’t want. You’re entitled to your opinion but I advise that you get yourself an iPhone 7 and keep an open mind. I’m fairly certain you realize how much better it is 05/23/2016 Anthony Reply Not very nice. Also, Apple is just as good as Android, theres aspects that one company has over the other, and vice versa, so the best thing to do is just to test out both and find your favorite and use it because Android and Apple’s problems and advantages weigh out each other so it really just matters which one you like the most so just use the one u like and stop arguing. 08/19/2016 Zane Reis Reply I prefer Android because of the coustomization it has to offer. I prefer to be able to change change almost every aspect about my phone and making it the way “I” like it, not the way Apple likes it. I like the coustomization while others find it chaotic, confusing, and would rather it be (in their eyes) simpler. 05/26/2016 Billy Reply Says the one who has Zombie Knight as their username. 07/18/2016 Nate Pauley Reply That’s an interesting rather stupid mindset to have and it makes me reflect on the time I had those same views. It took me 6 years as an android user to eventually realise how inferior it is to iOS. Android is plagued with fragmentation, so much that not even customisation can save it. There should be a term that describes blindsided android followers, if there is one then I’d like to know it. iOS is solid, stable, secure and much more better looking than android – Apple pays exquisite attention to the finer details and they will continuously improve on the irritating nooks and crannies so many people mention in the comments. The best part is APPLE USERS CAN ACTUALLY BE A PART of the firmware updates and have assurance in a better OS experience overtime. I’ve had my S6 for a year and I’ve only managed to have one firmware update that took 7 months to deliver. I can only give credit to android for the premium android devices such as my S6, until then the physicality of a device alone cannot make me shift in the near future. I want a solid experience, not a hollow one. 08/02/2016 Adarsh Reply Hi, Your comparison of iphone with S7 is not right because in case of iphone both hardware and software are developed by Apple and in case of S7 developer of hardware is Samsung and developer of software is Google. I use Nexus 5 phone, hardware and software both developed by Google and manufactured by LG and ipad Air2 by Apple. Both devices update periodically whenever updates are released and I am happy with both. 09/15/2016 Me Reply LOL stay laughably buthurt/beyond tasteless loser Fandroid X ) 03/02/2017 xxLoser123xx Reply Wow you know how to use a Thesaurus. 03/06/2017 Sally Fallis Reply Wow! I AM impressed! You know about the Thesaurus!! I didn’t think anyone under 50 ever heard of it anymore! 12/17/2015 Noah Reply This comment, as well as this article are laughable at best. Coming from a person who owns all major Apple products but frequently bounces back and forth in the smartphone department, I don’t see how any of these actually make the iPhone “better” than android. I would say the only point that is valid is the support Apple has from app developers. It’s pretty easy to see that apps on the iPhone can be “prettier” than apps on android with the extra animations, and quick gestures. However even that is relative, since iOS gives you security and “pretty animations” but gives of freedom and functionality in the process. I still can’t tell you which phone is better, as that all is personal preference and I really don’t care which phone is “better”. I just want a phone that does what I want it to do without too many hiccups (which is why I’ll never buy another Samsung device). For now, I’d say in terms of productivity, the iPhone is great if you are a person who needs iMessage, FaceTime, and the Apple ecosystem to feel comfortable doing work. While I believe most android phones will get work DONE. With the amount of third party apps available to you on the play store, multi window, Google now on tap, and other gestures. I have always felt an android is phone is more a workhorse while the iPhone is king of simplicity. 05/23/2016 Anthony Reply Congrats, you just wasted about 5-15 minutes of your time typing out this article because its not going to convince anyone. Just stick to the one you like best and live life. 05/25/2016 Blake Kersey Reply And what makes you think he gives a f$&# what you think?? 05/30/2016 hello Reply Unless you’re a billionaire you cannot stick to the pone that you wanto 07/30/2016 Avalanche Tsunami Reply Dude, he also has a “Android vs iPhone: 15 Reasons Android is Better” article too. So, he’s not being biased. http://www.gottabemobile.com/2016/05/26/android-vs-iphone-2016-android-better/ 11/10/2016 Pixleboy2 Just because he has another article doesn’t mean this one’s biased 01/30/2017 Selenia Thank you for that. This article and many commenters made me want to vomit thinking he was so biased and the sheep just followed along. I can give numerous reasons Android is a better OS, but that is not the point. However, some Android devices suck. Most of the detractors comments are true of stock Samsung devices. Samsung may be the most popular, but far from the best. They make pretty good hardware, but the software begs for rooting and custom ROMS. I am typing from a Nexus 6P, which is pure Android. Google does good with monthly updates, too. But I am using Pure Nexus, the best reason for owning a Nexus/Pixel device, with ElementalX kernel for out of this world stability, smoothness, flexibility, and battery life. Unless I use hotspot(tunneled over VPN), I only have to charge every 2 days under pretty heavy use. PN is actually updated more than Google’s stock and usually delivers security updates within a day of release, which is faster than Google often rolls it out to most users. 01/06/2016 Leo Keys Reply Why would someone else go with a product by Google, NVidia (I will come back to them), or Microsoft; over that “A…” Company (Repeat)? The reason people would use nVidia over the AMD (god I hate AMD’s Products) GPU’s found in Mac products? They want a more powerful GPU. Apple says that their “PC’s” are better and use top-notch products. Why don’t they use the GeForce GTX 980m in the MacBook Pro? Why don’t they use Quadro cards over FirePro cards? Because Apple doesn’t know anything about Graphics. As for iMac’s I have no clue why some use an i5. Apple products thermal throttle a lot. Android is secure with the right Antivirus programs. It is also much more free to do what ever you want. But, because your an iSheep, you can’t process facts that favor the other side of the grass. Guess your life must be happy, getting råpēd by Apple, every year and paying thousands on eye candy. Why use Google or Bing over Yahoo? Yahoo sucks, that’s why. Face the fact that Yahoo and other search engines are inferior to Google. Apple products are trash and are eye candy for white girls (Starbucks and that stuff). 01/06/2016 Pedro Coimbra Reply Now you have to bring the Nvidia/ATI war? What, the iphone/android isn’t enough for you? Dude AMD cards are equally powerful, no matter how much you “hate them”. Why Apple chose AMD? Maybe prices, power consumption, price/performance ratio, easier to adapt to their hardware, who knows? But a company such as Apple (you can write the complete name, it won’t bite you) so adept at optimization doesn’t make these decisions lightly, they HAVE a reason, one that you *don’t know*, but that’s irrelevant. About the i5, a reason for the apparent lower specs must be because of how streamlined and optimized the OS is, instead of being made to work with zillions of combinations of brands, boards, peripherals. So what you want in hardware to cope with the software, was made achieved with the fat-free software. «Android is secure with the right Antivirus programs», well I guess any system is secure with the right Antivirus programs, isn’t it? but never 100%. How about a system that doesn’t need antivirus, just a little inteligence from it’s user? Android safe… yes, keep dreaming, it’s not as the net isn’t filled with cases of security holes and breaches of android. If you reply to my I advise you right now to not bringing ATI/Nvidia stupid nerdish arguments or sheep mentality, about mobile platforms and geekinesses like that, because I simply don’t have the patience. P.s: «Apple products are trash and are eye candy for white girls» …. LOL… I’m trying to contain myself here… :D 04/21/2016 Vickie Reply I love you 🙌🏼 (apparently I am a white girl who loves Apple and Starbucks… I’m more of a Costa girl myself) 05/23/2016 Anthony Reply Its based on opinion, Apple and Android are like XBox and PS4, they have advantages over each other and problems of their own, nothing is gained over arguing about it because recently Android has caught up to Apple so now its just up to personal preference because they are pretty much at the same level right now. 07/15/2016 quenchybro Reply why does everyone write a full on report about their opinion this is ridiculous 01/23/2016 Maestro Reply hhhh your gr8 especially last sentence 01/23/2016 Maestro Reply Last sentence especially Starbucks hhhhhhhh made me die of laugh 09/13/2016 bestdeals242 Reply Nice 03/21/2016 Matt Reply what search engine do you use Bing lol or internet explorer 05/23/2016 Anthony Reply Who the F-Word uses Internet Explorer anymore 05/03/2016 Thomas Oglesby Reply Are you ok? Do you need help? The only reason you like them is because you a billable fanboy that refuses to try anything else, and just because it’s ridiculously expensive, you think it’s better. I feel bad for you and your Apple world 07/02/2016 popcorn Reply yeap http://gtoe.me/l/7A0q-A-04r 07/06/2016 applefanbois Reply You’re just a douche…applefanboi 07/25/2016 Lana Rae Reply Yes, you have just confirmed what the article ‘why do Americans hate Android and love Apple?’ says. Very sad….. 10/06/2016 Alon Reply Amazing, almost all whats written in the article is wrong. More apps with faster updates??? How can it be if 85 percent of the market is Android, and it much more easier to write an app to Android? It’s not making any sense and wrong. Also other things like sharing things and integration compared to Apple products only. Almost every line in this article is not right. 12/12/2016 Cjros Reply LOL, thank you for making me 100℅ sure that Android is way better than newest IOS. Your arguments are so poor and naive :). The only thing youve got right is the SD expansion, but it is not any issue at all :). Thank you, my hero :) 12/15/2016 Debapriyo Reply You are so dangerously biased towards Apple that some of your words make so sense and are outright stupid. I have no problems with you choosing an apple product but lol. You don’t use Google search engine? Then you are missing out. Their search engine is still the best and most reliable and miles ahead of other search engine options. Google Maps way better than Apple Maps. Every tiny feature Apple introduces in the new version of IOS, Google had it in android 2 years back. I myself love some Apple products and appreciate the high standards of quality they incorporate in their products but please don’t even compare Apple with Google. Apple just makes iphones, macbook and some fancy toys. Google makes much much more and is the spearhead of IT innovation today. Be a fanboy but don’t be an idiot. 03/22/2017 ComputerGeek Reply you’re weird 06/23/2015 Chris H Reply Some of these reasons for being better than Android phones are oxymoronic. An extended warranty and readily available Apple Stores suggest that the iPhone is prone to bugs and damage. I will stick with my G3 because I know if I drop it it won’t shatter and I won’t have to give more money to Apple either for a case and/or a screen fix. There is a reason there aren’t Android stores out there. Because their phones don’t nearly have as many issues in my opinion. Consider Chevrolet and Honda. The Honda will last and is just as nice if not nicer than the Chevy, which will not last nearly as long and will force loyal customers to buy yet another Chevy. 07/27/2016 eiendiaies your_ufo Reply I would love to hear your comment now about your G3. Android stores are not because android companies dont give a f.ck about costumers, they just improve SPECS SPECS AND SPECS but where is NO improving quality. Why for example iphone 12 megapixel camera can beat sony xperia 23 megapixel camera, why iphone 1500 mah battery last longer than lg 3000mah, why fingerprint on iphone works much better than samsungs? And whats a practical difference between 640p vs 2k smartphone screen? Damn the real sheeps dont understand what apple cares about costumers and they stay at same screen resolutions because they just dont need to improve screens, android companies just keep adding numbers on specs. But where is quality improvment? You say iphone works better because of lower resolution screens, but than why androids keep improving resolutions but forget about older android users? I am ex samsung and LG user, rubbish costumer services, if android die than i must wait couple weeks for replacment, if somethin happen with iphone i know where is apple store and dealing with them in same day. Price stays high for iphone for a real reason. Iphone is not about SPECS, its about quality in every aspect. 09/30/2016 Linked Devices Reply The issue with iPhones that I hated was that the only way you could fix any glitch that would inevitably crop up is by factory resetting the phone each and every time. It’s such an annoying and time consuming process having to set everything back up again. When I made the switch to Android I was really impressed by how stable and self contained it was. Whenever there was a glitch it was limited to that particular app and you could simply reinstall it and it’d be fixed. I’ve never encountered any systemwide issues such as the iPhone misc storage bug that would happen to me all the time with the 6s. Apple does a great job hiding all of its glitches by simply not providing any prompts. Apps just disappear when they crash. It’s terrible. I know a lot of people with the misc storage bug to this day and don’t know it. They just think they’re out of space all the time because they need a new phone.. 09/30/2016 Linked Devices Reply I lol’d at how much superior the author thought the lightning cable was because it was reversible. You have a fifty fifty chance at it if you do it blindly but most cables have a dimple on top to make sure you get it even time. It’s the most versatile cable, it’s simple, affordable and it just works. No one really has a hard time plugging them in, that was an invented problem. 06/25/2015 RuskieBear Reply 90% of these are false 09/30/2015 poopy Reply You’re just a piece of poop 09/14/2016 Trashpple Reply Chill out iRetard. 10/28/2015 jihou Reply your moms false 06/30/2015 phinfankid Reply I’m a long time android user, but I thought about switching to iPhone on my last upgrade. Some of these were acceptable reasons, but most were not. My wife is using an iPhone 6, and I have the Galaxy S6 edge. We both agree that my phone is far superior in terms of speed and screen resolution, but her camera, even being spec-deficient to my Android, seems as good as, or even better somehow. I like your point on the updates all rolling out at once, but almost every other “point” you made about iPhone being better boils down to one thing: lots of your friends have iPhones. That’s it. That’s the selling point, and the basis of this article. “iPhone apps look better.” – That’s completely relative. Lots of apps do look better, but they generally are paid apps that are free in the Play Store. “Works for all your devices” – So what? I thought this was a phone article. Android works with all your crap too. “No Carrier bundled apps” – I dont know how that’s a selling point, but okay, you win. Bloatware is an issue on android. “Sharing to other iPhones”/”Better resell” – Your friends all have them, so you should too. Then you can sell them to other friends who have older ones and make more money. Ridiculous. Yeah, you get a few more bucks for them, so that means you should have an inferior phone? Who buys a phone because of resale value? Preposterous. “Lightning cable is miles better” – My S6 charges from nothing to 40% in 10 minutes. iPhone can’t do that. I understand that the cable may be good, but “miles better” is a stretch. “Apple Stores” – So? I don’t even understand how this is a point in your article. Go to best buy, it’s the same crap. “Touch ID”/”Headphone controls” – Those both work flawlessly on a good number of high end android devices as well. “iMessage, Facetime, blah blah” / “Share apps easily” – All your friends have these, so you should too, or they’ll laugh at you. “Siri works better than Google Now” – Google Now isn’t Siri. That shouldn’t be a comparison. It’s not trying to be Siri. It’s a voice search, and that’s it. Siri works, but it doesnt work “better” than anything else, because there’s nothing to compare it to. If you like having Siri, good. “Notifications are better” – No, they’re not. Android’s notifications work exactly the same. Now don’t get me wrong, I’m not saying iPhone isn’t better, I’m just saying you haven’t proven that it is here in the slightest. Both OS’s are very well made, and the playing field is far more level than any avid IOS or Android user wants to admit. 07/30/2015 Helene Reply Excellent comment. I totally agree with you. 08/07/2015 Sam Reply DONT throw away your s6 edge… get an iphone but if you can use them interchangeably 07/15/2016 quenchybro Reply lol hi sam 10/09/2015 Palbo Reply I disagree. Bloatware is not really a problem on Android; any respectable company will only install commonly used and necessary apps like the Play Store and Gmail. If you are buying a phone that will leave your wallet intact (and still deliver better specs in every single measurable way than an iPhone 6, such as the lenovo k3 note) from a less known company which may allow bloatware, you can easily root the phone and uninstall it. I do agree with your other points, though! 05/27/2016 ZENCKPRI Reply Phinfankid you are completely right. I agree with everything you said. You are probably the only logical person who has commented so far. Also the iPhones storage is just a scam to keep people paying and buying more storage. Unfortunately the Samsung Galaxy s6 also removed the microsd slot, but luckily Samsung got it sh*t together with the Samsung s7, which in my opinion is the best phone. 07/12/2016 10beasts Reply You really explained the situation very well! Loved it. 07/09/2015 D Reply This article compares Apples to apples. Your references to Android are focused towards Samsung (you know the company that makes the screen, processor, RAM, and ROM in most Apple devices). Compared to a more vanilla Android experience, Apple blows. My $200 Zenfone 2 is better than any fruity phone at a third of the cost. With Apple, you pay more for less, but get a pointless logo. 07/10/2015 Scott Reply What about Apples different charger cords? Droids micro USB cords work with any other Android device. In fact, pretty much all phones but apple use it. They want you to need to buy new chargers more often. Apples are streamlined fads also, just like every product they’ve ever released. Yeah, cause being “cool” means getting the same more expensive products all the other rich kids got. 07/30/2015 Helene Reply I had both and I don’t agree with this article. I prefer Android phones over Iphones. I think Apple have better computers, but not better cell phones. 03/06/2016 Firas Bajjar Reply Keep dreaming…. 03/06/2016 Firas Reply Keep dreaming….Apple has better computers you serious? You can do a lot of stuff on Windows pcs while Mac struggles to do one stuff….At least it’s stable and easy to use through…But seriously it’s overpriced shit…You can get almost awesome gaming laptops for the price of a MacBook Air. In fact, iPhone is better than android….Because the mobile era is another thing, it’s called mobile for a reason. It should be easy to use and quick. That’s why Apple wins at this point…Come on get real men you wanna play GTA V on your mobile? No for sure. Apps are even better (which surprises me why it isn’t the same for a Mac vs Windows) iPhone’s are faster than most android phones….But if you compare it to stock original android phones, the iPhone still beats them but not as much as other android phones. Because unfourtantely Google didn’t know how to configure Linux properly but i bet you if it does…The iOS faster than android is a history….Linux is ultra-powerful and that’s why most of the world super computers use it…Because you can tweak it the way you like and you will get an extremely faster performance than Windows and Mac. But Google couldn’t handle it I guess….Even the Java language is much faster in terms of processing but I’m still surpsised why iOS apps are still faster….It’s just another replica of Nokia’s fault with Symbian (Nokia never built a stable Eco system for it until it’s near to death period, which led the CEO to get rid of Symbian because it takes years to built an eco system) 05/19/2016 PABLO Reply Right off the bat i can tell you are a little kid who just bought a samsung and is butt hurt you made the wrong choice, “struggles to do one stuff” he also pays great attention in class shown by how grammatically correct this is (as i was writing this I found this… “The iOS faster than android is a history” WHO TEACHES THIS KID I NEED TO COMPLAIN)! 08/04/2015 Robin Reply Poorly written article bringing in irrelevant points and downright false information. Take your “works great with all your devices” section for an example. I use an android phone and an apple computer, and the two devices are 100% compatible with no need for a “third-party application” or service. Completely untrue information in this section. Also I have texts and all the regular online messaging apps I use from both devices well synced. All data, photos, contacts, music, etc from my phone are stored in a cloud service and attainable through my mac computer and my (android) phone. Also your first section “iPhone Apps Are First and Better Looking” contradicts itself. 07/06/2016 Gretchen Alexander Reply My iPhones have NEVER worked great with my PC laptop. NEVER. And the people in the store aren’t much help either. I’ve wasted hours in there. So I don’t know who the person who wrote this article talked to, but my experience has been awful with compatibility between iPhone and PC. In fact, it’s the main reason I’ll never buy another iPhone. 08/10/2015 Malin Saming Reply Really? Here are 10 reasons you have apples for brains: Android is free, Google drive storage is FREE. 15 gig of files, unlimited photos! Androids voice recognition is WAY better, try a comparison, Siri is like a nagging wife who can’t get it right. Android phones have wireless charging! Android phones built in payment that works everywhere. Not at 3% of stores like Apple payment. Android phone MULTITASK, thats right you can run a dozen apps at the same time while talking. Android phones have sizable widgets, so you have live streaming info on your home screen. Android phones are available in endless formats, not like the communist way “everyone has the same”. Android phones PLAY ALL FILES, iphones only play Mp3’s from itunes etc etc pain in the Apple. Android phones have rapid charging, 10 min = 4 hours of use. Android phones are available with 2 days of battery. I could go on and on but your Apple brain will not listen anyways. You probably have a really nice typewriter that you show off the lack of it needing toner or electricity. There is a reason Android is about 82% of the market and Apple has fallen from 33 to about 12%… In fact the remaining iphone users I know all run Google everything on their iphone anyways, why not get the best hardware too. I look at everything I can and see things for how they are, then I buy the best I can find, if you do the same you will love your new Galaxy S6 8^ ) 12/13/2015 Pedro Coimbra Reply I tried, but stop reading after the «iphones only play Mp3’s from itunes etc etc pain in the Apple.» Just this BS of a sentence already has 2 lies in it.

Honestly, these are more like 15 reasons why an iPhone user should switch to android as soon as possible. Most testify to the fact that Apple product users are chained together under the apple tree, sustaining themselves on apples only. On top of that they are forced to watch android user eat happily from all the trees in the garden, even apples trees, even inventing fruits of their own. 01/25/2016 Real mofo Reply Your clearly insane 09/03/2015 Lodosa Reply Ja wybrałbym androida: http://logoff.pl/ios/wybralbym-androida-a-nie-ponownie-iphone/ 09/03/2015 GoToHell Reply One of the worst article I ever read. And childish comparison . 09/16/2015 Srikanth Reply I can say something here because I own and use both iPhone 6 Plus and a Samusng Galaxy S6 edge equally everyday. So I think I am in a position to give a fair judgement …or at least decide what works better for me. I have changed over from iPhone as my default device to S6 edge and back to iPhone few times. But I find myself using iPhone 6 Plus more often than S6 Edge…because of these reasons 1. Smartphone is smart because of quality apps. I always found iOS apps looking neater, working smoother and more consistent compared to Android Apps. Just to quote an example…Adobe acrobat reader which i made default app to open PDF files….is not able to open files since last two days all of a sudden and reporting error. Everything is updated but still doesn’t work somehow. But works fine with iOS. 2. Screen of iPhone is marginally inferior to my S6 edge which is stunning. But I don’t hold them near my nose and try noticing pixels. From a practical point of view iPhone screen is absolutely fine. 3. In spite of inferior hardware specs on paper, I can’t deny iPhone user interface is more fluid and smooth. Thats what makes the experience more pleasant for me. 4. iPhone 6s is already launched…I am not upgrading. But know what? Last night iOS9 update was available to my phone. I have already updated to same. Isn’t that amazing? I can’t help comparing my Galaxy note 4, my near stock android Motorola droid turbo.. etc..which haven’t received even 5.1.1 Lollipop when Android Marshmallow is about to be launched in a month. Sad. This alone is enough for me to stick to iPhone as my default device. 5. I havent noticed parallels for some Apps in Android (Drafts, Soulver etc). Which I learnt to use often and liked. I am a fan of some automation apps like Tasker on android which doesnt have an iOS equivalent. But as of now my use of same is less. 6. I guess iOS is bit more secure compared to android against virus attacks and hacking. it IS something important to me in this era of mobile banking and when we keep so much data on Google drive and One Note etc. and hey…Google has made most of its apps available to iOS. I agree my S6 edge is superior in Camera department and pictures look very good. Also usage of widgets is better in android. But after using both OS since last 3-4 years, I am sticking with iPhone as my default and S6 edge for miscellany and photos. This is what works for me. I know others have other reasons to stick to any one OS. I have best of both worlds now but can’t help saying one is better than other at present. 12/02/2015 Zombieknight Productions Reply Updates are an invalid point, because the newest version of iOS isn’t as good as a 2 three year old version of Android 12/02/2015 Srikantha Krishna Reply I don’t agree with you there. Updates are important. They optimise the software, remove bugs and important to plug security issues. Of course Google releases them but only nexus customers get it. Other manufacturers don’t release it in time. Tell me now how many handsets are going to get Marshmallow and when???? 04/25/2016 Sally Fallis Reply So which is less complicated for the over-50 me who is good with words but not pictures? I had to ask a young person what all those little dots and waves, etc., meant on my Ipod Touch. I really miss words, but I realize I am alone in that. Is a Samsung any easier to navigate for (duhhh…) me? 07/11/2016 Iggy Z Reply If you are over 50 you should definitely stick with Apple 1. it is extremely easy to use 2. you can do many tasks without even doing anything, but simply telling your phone to wake you up at 5am, or to remind you to take your pills when you get home 3. you can change the text size and icon size to accommodate your eye-sight 4. you can ask any teenager to help you organize the icons into more intuitive way Microsoft Windows phones are rich on words, but while it would satisfy your need for everything being written – the phone will be difficult to use, and will still contain many icons. So, go with Apple, even an older 16GB model, will still be fully supported, and will work perfectly well, do not get 64GB version, you wont need all that memory. 07/16/2016 quenchybro Reply but apple is expensive 08/25/2016 ermm Reply with android it is much easier to use… you can tell your phone to set and alarm….you can change the text size 01/10/2017 Frank McConnell Android is an absurd ecosystem, the UI is very hard to even remember, iOS is better due to the simplicity of the UI. OP was right about iPhones being easy, I use one because android is hard to use. Maybe you should get an iPhone, it’s 5x faster than every android phone in the world and you’ll get a good one on eBay for like $200! Why do you think Google is better on iOS than on android. lel, Android is a joke OS and should be defunct! 10/15/2015 Andras Reply I´ve been an iPhone user for 2 years, recently I bought an Android phone to verify if really Android is superior… After 2 months of testing it, I sell the Android and bought an iPhone 6… This do not prove that iPhone is better, but for my needs, iPhone is totally superior… Android is good, everything is cheap but is not an stable OS… Yes you can have all personalize, but for what? I´m not a teenager anymore so whats the point to have all personalized and change it every week? By the way the output of the sound of the iPhone is really more superior than the output of any Android phone With an iPhone (in music business) is way better you can control lights, console really simple with iPhone and all tech for music is much more easy to sync and to handled on an iPhone… Music business in a MAC is much much easier I love iPhone and I would not change it anymore Like I said I´m not saying iPhone is better for everyone but for my needs yes it is 12/02/2015 Zombieknight Productions Reply Wow! You’re actually dumber than every other I sheep here. IPhone has good sound? Better than any Android? Hahahahahahaha! Have you even seen an HTC One phone? Best speakers and any phone! Ever. IPhone speaker is tinny garbage. The S6 even has the same placement, but sounds much better. Seriously, Google HTC One m8 or m9. Cm8 literally got the top phone of 2014, and everyone mention how good the speakers work. I also got first place cuz it was vastly superior to any iPhone. Better software, better design, better screen, etc 12/02/2015 Zombieknight Productions Reply And please specify what Android phone it was. Otherwise I’ll assume you’re lying because there are so many and you can’t name one. Or you got a cheaper old one. Android high end phones are very stable. Look it up. They’re way more stable than iOS 01/30/2017 Selenia Reply Signed, someone who has never used Viper4Android. Seriously, I can’t stomach the sound output of very many phones without it. Only a few Androids that have nice customized audio processing(like the LG V20) and no iPhones or Windows phones. Many of the rest of Androids can use this superior sound mod. I have a Nexus 6P with Pure Nexus and ElementalX kernel, which has nice front firing speakers, better than iPhones. V4A gives audio processing to match.

I carried the Z10 now carry the Passport with BB10. I only have it because my company prefers BB’s security. But as far as fuctionality, it’s like working with bear skins and stone knives compared to iPhone or Android. The lack of apps and limited integration with other devices is stifling. That’s why I carry a separate personal phone. It’s also why BB is abandoning BB10 and switching to an Android platform. So are you going to cast off your somewhat acceptable friends who carry BlackBerry when their platform becomes Android? They better run out and get an iPhone when that happens so they can still be honored to be deemed worthy of your friendship. 07/11/2016 Iggy Z Reply 1. Android they switch to is FULLY custom and has all google services BLOCKED 2. This is the reason why companies are abandoning BlackBerry due to high maintenance costs and instead make private applications for iPhones which you can only download using a special code, a secure application within a secure platform, cheaper to maintain, more convenient for an employee to use. I completely agree with Bob, Androids are for 12 year olds and vagrants, the paper specs of Androids (factually and historically) are not an indicator of how they perform. And the fact that you think that you are smarter than a mass of hard working high ranking professionals, and that you need to show them all how “individual” you are by always “personalizing” your phone – just shows you are a fool and have nothing to do but to play with yourself on your phone like a kid, I bet you are one of those people who thinks wearing a watch is stupid and unmanly because you have a clock on your phone. 07/16/2016 quenchybro Reply ur insulting me cos im twelve so dont try piggy 01/30/2017 Selenia Reply You guys keep proving how Apple markets to ignorant people with a credit card. Reason many companies don’t use Android is because of the differences in OS customization from device to device and manufacturer to manufacturer. That can be a nightmare for testing in house apps. Nothing to do with security. My company uses Android tablets, but all the same kind. Only point you are right about is specs don’t reflect performance. Nexus/Pixel devices have good specs, not the best, but just try finding a faster Android or iPhone, for that matter. Why?

An iPhone 64gb on contract costs almost the same as a carrier free nexus. I am a galaxy s7 user and the screen quality is maybe 2 generations over the iphone. As for the notifications, I prefer android’s iteration way more than apples. And about the cables, except the s7, all flagships use USB type c Samsung compensates with wireless charging. The battery life on a nexus or an s7 edge is way superior than the iPhone. And hangout video quality is as good as facetious. Also I like the fact that you don’t need to get out of hangouts to make a video call. In iphone you can usee iMessage but then to make a video call you need to get out and go to facetime. I get to play with manual controls on my camera which iphone doesn’t permit. I can literally go all day long about this. Just one actual good point about iphone you could have mentioned instead of the trash is that it has a stronger graphic processor that but by a small margin. 03/23/2016 sheel r shah Reply One more thing. You mentioned sharing. Do you feel ashamed that you cannot share media via Bluetooth?? The most basic mode of sharing? Talking about airdrop please use wifi direct once. Or nfc sharing. 03/28/2016 Stanata Reply Basically what this article is saying is: “use iPhone instead of Android – it’s more easy to use if you’re an idiot!”… lol There isn’t even one reason of those in the article that is 100% true… and almost all of them are complete crap! I mean come on – even monkey can plug MicroUSB and it is “a must” standard in Europa for instance anyway. Let alone that the future is in the wireless charging… And who today is NOT using Viber or WhatsApp? Who needs another messenger? I can continue, but don’t see point in that – the articles like this is obviously paid one. But sooner or later it will be clear at the end – the open environment will always be above the close one, because it is more close to the people! Cheers! 03/29/2016 Dark Penguin Reply I’m not sure I get why the headphones are supposed to be a distinctive selling point. My GS5 came with headphones that offer the same control options. They didn’t last, because we have cats, but that’s beside the point. 03/31/2016 SHERIF SHARMY Reply A few years ago my wife bought me an iPhone after I discarded my Symbian phone. Anyway I started to use this and found out in dismay that I have to have all products to live . Windows used to crash if I connect my iPhone…….it does not like it. Couldn’t do anything without iTunes. Can’t see anything on the phone while connected to Windows except photo. Couldn’t copy my videos at all. Then the account with and once you are inside the prisoners you are under arrest until proven innocent. Luckily the Sony Z1 appeared and decided to get one. In two days I found life with this phone by far easier than that silly apple I was using……..I just gave to a friend without asking for any cash. Good riddance…..

It’s a Huawei, nice BIG screen I guess they call a Phablet. My younger son has an iPhone 6 plus. I decided to try an iPhone 5s just to see what it’s like. I have 30 days to check it out. So far, the ONLY thing see is the slow motion camera that’s cool and maybe some cuter emogies …I think they’re called. Otherwise….. I’m so far not impressed. My Huawei Android is 16g the iPhone 5s is 16g. The Huawei was I think $200 and the 5s $160 with its VERY tiny screen. My son has a 6 plus and 64g and that would cost me $650 or maybe it’s $650 for the6 plus 16g. Anyway…. Lots MORE MONEY. I guess if you have a lot of music… It’s better but I just have Lots of pictures. I like my sd card for these. I don’t know all the techy stuff and I don’t do Twitter or FaceTime or sharing pics except Facebook and text. I thought maybe some apps would be cooler but so far… I’m not impressed with the iPhone at all. Just my opinion. 04/12/2016 D Dawg Reply smoke weed everyday 07/16/2016 quenchybro Reply wtf!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 04/19/2016 J Corn Reply I knew this article was a joke when his very first reason is “Snapchat looks prettier on iPhone”. And you’re listing reasons why apple is different, not better. 04/21/2016 Anujay Singh Reply Apple optimises the iPhone’s hardware and software. The iOS Is custom built for and iPhone but the android softwares are not built for any particular device or hardware so optimisation is nog as good as in an Apple device. It not about specs the camera which shas more megapixels cannot alone deliver better pictures , a processor with more cores and greater clock speed can not alone give better performence until it utilises the most of it. So as Apple builds it products to its own requirements and deliver better products than android phones. An iPhone has better quality of internals as well as the body and feels premium than its competitors so that’s why an iPhone is an iPhone. 04/26/2016 De'Zsa Smith Reply Currently on my iPhone 6s+, sobbing as I type this. I’ve just got through longingly browsing Google’s Playstore, seeing all the recent updates of my favorite apps and hidden gems that the Apple Store just cannot compete with. Android has some seriously dedicated developers, and I’ve always admired them and even began looking into Android app development. That is… Until I switched over to iPhone several months ago after being a dedicated Android user. I will always be Team Android, hands down. I had a rooted Nexus 5, which means I’m all about customizability, design, testing, flexibility, and freedom. Then I decided I wanted to try something new—FaceTime, great camera, updated social apps like snapchat…you know, the basics. Biggest. Mistake. Ever. Switching over to Apple feels like I’m using a flip phone. Now I’m trying to decide if I should just switch back, or keep this iPhone as a means of communication (don’t know if I’m willing to give up FaceTime with family and friends) and have an Android for all the things I miss. 04/27/2016 weez Reply I just giggle at these articles. Ok Iphone kids, my phone has a webhost, tftp server, a windows deploy share with every iteration of windows going back to w2000, an SMB client, FTP client and host, Tftp server, wi-fi signal scanner, packet sniffer(nmap), a high frequency oscilloscope, a bluetooth HID remote that controls anything bluetooth, a linux/android debugger, point of sale and inventory tracking software(apple has it too but not complete on the phone), and at will I can change my MAC and spoof other phone’s IDs. My phone is a half decade old S2. So I guess if you plan on propping up a desk buy an Iphone, for everyone else that has work to do either grab a toolkit full of different things or just grab your android phone. 04/28/2016 Ken McDowell (@morpheusxp) Reply I don’t understand why it is all Android users say that iPhone users are sheep and that they use an iPhone because everyone else uses an iPhone. The iPhone has less than 20% market share world wide. That means less than 1 in 5 smartphone users have an iPhone. It seems to me going with the herd is more of an Android thing than an iOS thing. Just saying… 05/21/2016 Cowbladder Reply I think it is more because a lot of iPhone users seem cultic. I honestly think iPhone is a high quality product. But I really like high end Androids as well. However, I know people who use only Apple products and make little comments here and there about how inferior ALL Androids are. In that way I think they are like sheep because they have bought into this notion that their are no good Androids and they are operating on a higher plan than non-iPhone users. 05/23/2016 Anthony Reply Agreed. Probably because in the beginning people lined up outside of stores to get the latest and greatest iphone. It’s great hardware, but I can’t get used to a single button. Plus iphones seem to have a higher resale value. I don’t know. I do like how apple updates their devices in a timely manner and no bloatware, etc. I think Android is getting there, but unless it’s a nexus, updates are all over the place. I want the screen of a Samsung, build of an HTC with the battery life of my droid turbo, a headphone jack at the bottom of the phone instead of the top and I would be in heaven. Plus everyone I know say is that a Galaxy? So people in my area associate anything android as a Galaxy. Great marketing by Sammy, but perception becomes reality sometimes. 05/21/2016 Cowbladder Reply Meant to say plane, not plan. ☺ 01/30/2017 Selenia Reply Yup, it is about the Apple cult and the attitude that you are unwashed and not worthy if you use an Android. The attitude you must be broke, homeless, etc. My Android costs as much as a lower range current iPhone and can do way more. Here in the US, they have much greater market share, unfortunately. 04/28/2016 Joe Reply iphone has nothing on android. They have a good camera but that is about it. isheep all butthurt because android is taking over the world. 04/30/2016 qwertypop13 Reply So far all my favourite android apps were not available on ios, plus a lot of apps are a minimum of 10 cent cheaper on gpl than on apple app store. I also find it totally ridiculous that iphones need to be jailbroken to undergo any form of customization. Plus who wants fast updates at the expense of severe bugs, them slowing down stuff even more and getting a crappy operating system that hasnt changed since 5 years. Iphones are for people that only use their phones to txt and make calls. ps. I have a $20 alcatel phone and wouldnt ever trade it for an iphone. Buy what you like, but the points on this website are the worst I have ever seen. As far as I know you cant even use iphones to transfer files other than audio and photos to and from macs/pc’s. Apple phones are overpriced by like $500 dollars just because they have a flashy logo which they stole from the beatles. 05/05/2016 anthony Reply I love my android devices. Have I had problems. Yes. More than my wife’s iphone? Definitely. But I tinker with it a lot more than her iphone. I transfer files back and forth from a computer a lot easier with my device. Yes using third party apps but it’s still easier. I have all my music in google play, but use itunes (whole family uses ipods) so I just sync up that to google music and playlists as well. Each device has it’s pros and cons. I have used a rooted tablet to get pure android (didn’t like it) and have an ipad 2 which I love. It’s about choice and I like that we have it. Two points I agree with the author about: Timely updates and bloatware. HTC is bucking the trend to stay afloat by addressing this. Wireless charging is not worth it yet. I much prefer quick charging and new devices starting to roll out with usb-c. 05/07/2016 C Reply The article and ensuing comments are a joke. This is what The internet has come to now days. Let me be clear, I have years and years of experience with Android, IOS, Windows & Linux. I have every certification and more hours logged on to these then most of you. Now that we have established my far superior ability to actually comment here goes. First of all, the people on this blog and on others like it simply cannot help the fact that more people love iphone than android, period. So they make nasty little comments because they are frustrated that in reality they couldnt influence people in high school and they aren’t able to now. Second the android users who get angry at Apple users simply appear to only be mad because they don’t have an iphone them selves. Guys! Really! Let me be clear I have Windows and android and iOS. Iphone for the nomal every day user is PERFECT! Let them be! The android is perfect for more shady people who want to be power users an anarchists or some how feel like they are breaking the law or the rules. That is how android feels and that’s the base line of the os. I currently have an android because I can be one of those more shady people who like to go against the grain. But I don’t like android. Who the he’ll wants to root a phone? Who wants to spend hours on doing something? Not I! It takes me 10 minutes to jail break an Apple as and BAM I’m a super users with a linux based system and am sitting with a very powerful device! They all being said I have an android bc of expandable memory, an IR blaster, and a few other small features. When Apple steps up the game with these I will switch to Apple. Here is one reason why. What is a smart device? It is an item created to make your life as a human eaiser. Apple does that by leaps and bounds! The phone thinks of you like a loyal old dog and wants to do nothing more than serve your every whim. I can tell you the iphone holds up better, know why? Ever had to fix your mom or dads PC? And you think to your self wth are they doing with this thing. We never hear that issue out of iphone. So really is a beast just for that reason alone simply bc the general population can break them by doing stupid stuff. Now on to adress some other stupid comments for people who pretend they are SO smart. Windows is better than a Mac ios! Hum WRONG! Know why? Windows is a dos based crap system with a gui created for the average consumer to use a device. It’s not a damn computer it’s a pretty device to help you numb skulls use paint and word or get on the internet. What is my point now!! Oh yet MAC IOS is FAR superior at least for anyone who actually knows how to use Linux which by the way was and still is the base os on which all other smart software was and still is created. So you pretty little Windows fanboy users, please get a grip because until you stop drooling over your poster size photo of Bill gates and actually learn Linux you know nothing about computing. The really dumb person who commented about Honda’s vs Chevys! Hahaha seriously though? You also probably know nothing right? Honda and GM use the exact same part manufactures which in turn makes both cars CRAP! Research before you comment. Go get what ever phone you want and fanboys of each need to get a grip! 05/29/2016 C Reply Just to clarify a few things for the “people who pretend they re SO smart” Windows has been detached from DOS since windows 2000, It maintains compatibility by running an DOS virtual machine on the NT Kernel. Not all systems are based on Linux, Linux is based on Unix, Mac OS (and IOS) is largely based on BSD which is a variant of UNIX, The Windows Micro-kernel is also partly based on UNIX. For someone who has “years and years of experience with Android, IOS, Windows & Linux.” and “every certification and more hours logged on to these then most of you” you are spreading a lot of misinformation. I personally own all apple products, but have and still use the other platforms, They all have their advantages and downfalls. And although I use a Mac, Ipad and Iphone predominantly I still have moments of frustration when I miss windows, android and linux for one reason or another. 05/29/2016 CC Reply Not the same “C” as above btw 05/18/2016 Nikhil Bansal Reply Great Information.

But android will only have a bit better graphics because of its amoled technology 06/02/2016 Jacob Reply If you wanted to make this a fair comparison you’d compare it against Vanilla Android so it’d be the Nexus 6p and immediately your points about bloatware and cable become invalid. Also, how can you say apple doesn’t come with bloatware? Have you tried removing the stocks app recently? What about file sharing, have you never heard of Android Beam? Or the fact almost every flagship has a fingerprint scanner now? This is the most poorly written, one sided piece of crap I’ve seen in a long time. How do you even have a job? P.s. I own a Nexus 6p for private use and iPhone 6s Plus for work and they’re pretty much equal in every way except for the Nexus having a better screen, free apps, faster charging and longer battery life. 07/16/2016 quenchybro Reply +1 lol 06/03/2016 alpharidley9098 Reply This article made me laugh pretty hard. I just love the reasons they give for the phone being better. Now 1 thing that is always MORE important than ALL of these is the actual phone. Also, those apps that come with the phone, it depends on what you are getting… Also, you do know apple is making a switch to MicroUSB right? Humph. Seems like just in this 1 paragraph I have already made better points than this article. Anyways, phone-wise, androids are almost always more powerful than an apple phone because of the fact that iPhones are never equip with a good core or a good amount of RAM. They slow down quite quickly and seem obsolete after a few months. Yes. Months. I have had my Moto G3 for awhile and it is still ultra fast and has no technical issues. 06/03/2016 Jens Lipponer Reply problem with iphones is that u need itunes etc.. and too many permissions. I like to just plug in and drag and drop files…. I don’t give a monkey’s behind whether apps look better or what not. let’s be honest, price wise the iphone is beaten every time. there is just no bang for buck.

It seems obvious to me. At least Android screens don’t break when you drop the phone on carpet like iPhone’s do. There’s Applecare because the iPhones break like a window hit by a baseball because the whole phone is either thin aluminum or covered in glass (which is a hazard if the glass shards cut you and potentially make you bleed out). The aluminum iPhone’s are currently being made of bend in your pocket! They’ll need some high quality flexible glass and easily bent straight CPU (without anything on the inside being destroyed). By the way, for the vibration thing on Android you don’t have to input password or anything just click the power button and hold down the turn down volume button for a second or two and that’s it. 06/10/2016 Shaggy C Reply So your reasoning is half “It’s popular” and most the other half is comparing apple features to the bad features of a multitude of android phones?

It could be called Android or robot or Apple or peaches or dog poo. All I care about is having a good phone that can do the most. Phones are expensive. I’m not buying a brand name. I’m looking to buy something that has everything it could possibly have if I’m going to spend that kind of money. You’re “reasons” show good things about IPhone, but are not “reasons” as to why it’s better. IPhones are good phones. People like IPhones because it’s a trend. It’s popular. That’s it. IPhones are not even close to androids. Be truthful. Androids are mini-computers. Literally. IPhone is not. You can do 100 more things with Android that you cannot do with IPhone. The That is the truth. And Apple products are a lot more expensive. Why would anyone pay more for a phone that gives you less? It boggles my mind. Android has variety. There are many, many phones, companies, styles to choose from. They even offer cheaper options that get the job done. They have an SD card slot. Why would anyone dish out $100’s more for more storage? That SD card is yours forever. For future phones or other devices. You can plug your phone into your computer and save(on the phone or SD card) anything (music, photo’s, video’s, contacts) and it’s yours. Without having to go through ITunes or anything else. Apple doesn’t own my stuff. I own it. And I can customize anything I own. There are IPhone stores for these little nick knacks. Transferring files, contacts, etc. It’s like going to a car dealership. One side has a variety of great cars. The other side has one car that is the most expensive. You see that all the other cars have a ton of features, options, colors to choose from, engines, horse power, cylinders, 2-door, 4-door, SUV’s etc. You ask “what’s so great about this lonely more expensive car tht only comes in one model and doesn’t have these other options?” The saleman replies with “Because it’s popular”. 07/06/2016 Gretchen Alexander Reply Yes, this!

I have two iPhones now, a 5 and a 6, that I can’t get my photos off of onto my PC laptop. I’ve gone into the Crapple store more than three times and still haven’t gotten them off. My idea of HELL is the Crapple store! I hate that place. There’s hardly room to stand and then you end up being sat at a table waiting with a bunch of other frustrated people waiting for a tech to help you. Of course this is after you make an appointment, or in my case last time, two appointments. I don’t see that as a plus at all because not only is going there a royal pain in the ass, but then they don’t even offer much help after several hours. My iPhone does not recognize as a drive when I plug it into my PC. It used to, and then stopped. I don’t want to have to use iTunes to transfer photos or music. I want to just plug it in and have it be a drive and copy whatever files I like back and forth. It does not work; and I’ve spent, literally, hours trying to get it to function that way. I also have a pretty complex DSLR camera and yet it is still easy as can be to transfer the photos from the memory card onto the computer. So why can’t a supposedly user-friendly phone just do the same thing? I seriously hate my iPhone 6 so much I wanted to shoot it, except I discovered it’s worth a good bit of money still so I’ll sell it on ebay. 07/09/2016 Joey Reply A lot of childish responses from android fans here. I gave the nexus 6p and try for 2 months after my old iPhone broke. Hardware was great, but I found on this android phone the app integration and interoperability to be no where near as good as an iPhone. Apple is just better when it comes to form and function. Buy an android if you want to tweak it forever and play in a sandbox, buy and iPhone if you need a productive phone. 07/10/2016 Colin Reply Your comment may not be childish but it is not correct. Comparable Android phones have far better form and function. Take the iPhone 6s plus verses a Note 5 or s7 Edge. The Apple is bigger and heavier yet packs has a smaller or same sized screen as the Samsung’s’ yet has far less features. Both these phones are far more productive, can multi-task properly, be fully customized and allow widgets on lock and home screens for speed, convenience and ease of use. The Note even includes a stylus or pencil. Great compact design, fully featured and greater functionality (Android) vs Heavy outdated bloated hardware with mid-range specs and limited functionality (IOS). Not to forget the limited compatibility of iPhones and lack of choice! 07/10/2016 Chris Reply There are facts, then there are opinions. 07/10/2016 Colin Reply This article is a disgrace, misleading at best. Most of the reasons are just not true or highly debatable. 07/12/2016 Benito Paul Reply congratulation all of u commented on weather iphone or android’s is the best In my point of view it may be any phone that is android or iphone. If we had a phone that should meet our requirements.Requirements means each and every people has different requirements in case of security,memory capacity and so and so. Hence apple or iphone buy any thing because all are vanity, “vanity of vanities” 07/14/2016 aileen Reply I’m someone who switched from android to ios but this article is utter bullshit. Yes, I love my iPhone and i’m so glad I switched by my samsung galaxy 4 was nothing but shit lately but these arguments in the article are dumb as hell. Lightning is better than micro usb? excuse me, what? my iphone takes ages to charge (iphone 6) whereas my s4 charged within an hour. i don’t see how that makes micro usb bad. but well my iphone battery lasts over a day and my old phone could have never. sharing location isn’t hard on android since almost everyone uses whatsapp bc imessage doesn’t exist on android and whatsapp has a location sharing option so that argument was dumb. yes, apps do look prettier on ios but i don’t see how only that would be a reason to switch?? this article clearly comes from someone who has only owned apple devices and doesn’t even know what they’re talking about, if you really want to prove a point you need to ask someone who has used BOTH of the things you’re trying to compare otverwise you’re just gonna embarass yourself. just saying. 07/20/2016 KappaPride Reply Why are you guys even arguing about this? 07/24/2016 George Reply The major advantage iOS has over Android is that Apple designs the phone and software. Whereas for Android (open source) other manufacturers have to play with it to get it to work and sometimes it’s not fluid. Take the Nexus phones for example…they just work like the iphones. No bloatware..nothing (like the iphone). Majority of my friends have iPhones and sometimes I wish I did too because of MMS (iMessage). I used both and I hate that i have to use itune for everything but it is what it is I guess. 07/24/2016 Landry Reply I’m 8 years experimented developer for iOs devices and I say that Apple releases so frequent updates because iOs is just a stone age OS to fool iOs users that Apple works seriously behind their products. It must run to compete Android OS. 07/27/2016 Aza Reply Best to have both. I have an Se and G4 best of both worlds 07/30/2016 Bob Reply So many things piss me off in this article but specifically stood out Notifications I have no idea with this author is saying he obviously hasn’t seen an android phone, they are exactly the same. Lightning vs. Micro-USB Micro-USB usually charges everything from headphones, to power banks, and of course cell phones. And multiple times to insert it is an absurd comment, after about a week you’ll probably memorize which way it goes, and how do you insert it incorrectly more than once. And USB type-C is just starting to come to the mainstream that’s why it’s not on everything. Storage Why do people even buy the 128 GB version, not to get apps but to download media like pictures, videos, music, etc. I agree with the statement about how sd cards are treated but there’s a much more simple solution, buy a larger storage option. Sharing purchased content Sign into the play store with the account that originally bought the content, install it, then sign out. Problem solved, and if anyone says “it’s more convenient” think about how often you might actually purchase something that costs actual money, I’ll bet it’s probably less than once a week. And it doesn’t take long to sign in and then back out 08/14/2016 Adso Rossi Reply I love iPhones. They always have nice designs and I like the simple interface. I have been itching to get an SE with its smaller dimensions (I like small phones). Money is not a problem to me but as much as I really want one I will stick with my Android device. Why? Cause the compatibility of iPhones to Windows pcs are real bad or none. You’d say “get a Mac” but I can’t: too many programs I need that unfortunately are only Windows-available. If this one single point of compatibility would be addressed, the iPhone becoming as compatible as Androids, I would get that iPhone SE in a heartbeat! 08/21/2016 nathanlittles plays minecraft Reply Who the hell needs iPhone I can name 100 reasons why Android is better but I’ll just name 20 1. Freedom 2. Apk 3. More sizes 4. More colours 5. Waterproof phones 6. Big and small tablets instead of the HUGE iPad 7. Clear cache option 8. For apps and also all the app store apps 9. No need for jailbreak but if you root you’re device will have no restrictions :D 10. Notification swipe 11. Google now 12. Google maps instead of the crappy apple maps 13. Multiple users feature 14. SD card storage So you don’t run out of storage easily like on the 16 gig iPhones (128GB or even 256GB) 15. Pattern unlock 16. There’s everything on Google play store even GPS spoofers to do the Pokémon go spoof in like 2 seconds 17. Unknown sources option 18. No need for an apple I’d all you need is a Google account which is way easier to set up and use 19. Get apps that are not out in your country easier (Pokémon go) 20. Android sounds better then apple 08/22/2016 Jim Reply This article made me so angry I must go punch a kitten. It’s an interesting psychological phenomenon, our emotional ties to brand loyalty. It’s as if the device we choose to use says something about who we are as people, and there is some ancient war of two types of people being waged through our genetics. Apple users are like Yankee fans, Android users are the goth kid outsiders. And the war rages on. 08/30/2016 Deleau Clément Reply Hi. Please kill yourself.

Like, the notifications. Android is wayyy better. You clear all at once or swipe. It combines like notifications that you can separate. It allows to interact with the notification and app without opening it and its just, way simpler and cleaner. 09/10/2016 Nigel Nderi Reply Let me settle this. Choose an iPhone if you are incompetent or are ok with a company controlling you’re phone completely. Choose an Android if you want to be able to enjoy the latest technologies and can competently manage it’s abilities without whining that it takes more than half a brain cell to use. 09/11/2016 Josh Mcduff Reply Just read all the comments and wow it’s all he said she said. I’ve had my Nexus 6p which btw one poster said it’s Google made nope huewei or whatever. Point is not the same, for about a year now and I’m now getting the iPhone 7. Are the specs pretty damn similar? Yes alot of the same features? Yes update often? Yes Nexus gets all the Android ones first like Apple. Price? Actually the 7 is less than the Nexus by about 150.00 CAD sooo that defeats the argument about price… Just saying. I love my Nexus but I’m open to changing. Ice bounced back and forth alot between Android and iOS can I say one is superior to the other? Absolutely not it all comes down to does it do what I want it to and can I afford it. 09/12/2016 Lee Reply All good and well people love free stuff but free stuff comes with a price of selling your info to the uncontrollable thirst party. iPhone also offer easy printing option than android you have to download something that will ask you to upgrade by paying just to use your printer no way! Also iPhone helps stop third party apps that try to use your phone making phone calls example if you are searching for nearest restaurant Google will show the call number to the same restaurant but when you try to call instead of calling direct the parasite apps like whatsaapp, text… And more they pop up asking you to use them making a call while they can’t function without your service they bug you each time taking away the time you spend trying to make a call. If you’re in a hurry and these app try to suggest you use it think how buggy this is. The same applies to text messages. 09/15/2016 Jada Reply Have u really owned an android?

So many more features and charging is so much faster and the battery life is amazing 09/15/2016 Ryan Reply You are a stupid retard Apple isn’t better than android. Apple has had to recall their product so many times because people died from the battery exploding. And with Apple every 3rd phone they stop making updates for it. Android always has updates for their products. Plus Apple owes the government 37 billion dollars Android doesn’t. The iPhone 7 that is coming out is a total ripoff. They copied Samsung. Apple has never made a crack resistance screen and a waterproof phone. Samsung is simply better. 09/17/2016 Rob Doyle Reply I completely am for people having their own opinion, that being said I disagree with the title of this article. That being said without any bias coming into play here, some of the points that the author was trying to make aren’t true or aren’t completely true. 1. “Works with all your devices”… The real title should be works better with all of your APPLE devices. The examples in the article are all apple examples. The author obviously has no experience with android or windows. 2. “Faster Updates”…. Compared to what android device? You can’t just say that Iphones get updates faster and compare that to all android phones. The way that this section was written made it sounds like the day an update is release for Android, nine of there phones get it immediately like the iPhones… this just isn’t true. If you have a nexus you get updates as they are released (just like and iPhone) There is a bunch of other examples that just show the author has no experience with android devices, I’m just going to keep this short. People will choose what they think is best for them. My issue is with the author, not the opinion. All the argument were completely based on opinion and not facts. People are going to read this and take it all as fact, instead of doing research and finding the right device for them. 09/18/2016 Jonathan Masters Reply I have both an iPhone 5 and a Galaxy S7. While there are some advantages to the iPhone, there are several reasons why I just can’t make a permanent switch. First, no home screen widgets (like my calendar and agenda). Sure, you can add something like that to the notifications screen, but that involve swiping, as opposed to right on the home screen. Second, it’s so difficult — even annoying — trying to organize files on the iPhone. On an Android, it operates exactly like a computer should (and our phones really are computers these days), with folders, subfolders, etc., so you can just copy the files to where you want them for later use. You can’t do that on an iPhone, where all of your files go to some mysterious and deep “collection” on the phone. If Apple were to add those two features, then I’d happily switch away from Android. 09/21/2016 de Coulon Thierry Reply I wanted to try an iPhone, so I got an old one. I could simply not install anything because everything on the AppStore has moved to iOS > 7. I could not bring a single file to the phone. All it would do is sync with iTunes on my Mac, but there is nothing to sync because I don’t use this Mac for everyday life. The iPhone I got did not have any smart way to save battery. The iPhone I got could not play any of my music because a) I could not upload it and b) I could not install anything that would play ogg files. The iPhone I got was heavier, thicker and less good looking than my current Sony. So OK it was an old iPhone, but 90% of what I say would be true for the latest iPhone, and at what price! If you live in the Apple world, then an iPhone is probably the logical choice. I live in the Linux world and now I know I’ll never take another look at an iPhone. 09/24/2016 Jim Washko Reply Worldwide stats – Android users 82% vs IOS users 18% There’s not enough votes to even tilt the scale towards IOS being better. Being as the story indicates Android phones are only good for 2 years that makes them more expensive. How can IOS users explain why 82% of the market would rather pay more for less?, if that were in fact true. Iphone offers less control, poor resoluion, no expandable memory and not all phones can share the same apps. Android offers all of it as well as compatible with Windows whcih is currently at 80% of the market share. This is like comparing the Yugo to Prius. Sure the Yugo is cheaper at first, but after a year of so, not so much. Iphone resale is more, but that will drop due to fewer and fewer users as they get tired of the box of crayons with only black and white as an option. when they can get the box of 64 and a sharpener 09/24/2016 Capi Reply Is this all a big joke? You keep saying “iPhone is better than Android” about ten times in the article, like a mantra we have to learn and assimilate, Am I the only one who noticed this? I have and iPad, and iMac and I used iPhone (4, 4s and 5) I am familiar with both iOS and OSX but actually I have an Android and installed Windows 10 on my iMac. OSX is a good system if you like simple and easy interfaces, I don’t really have any problem with it, is a really good system once you learn to do things that are diferent with Windows, like formating drives with Disk Utility. (And if we forget how difficult could be for some people to use drive formats like NTFS in a Mac) But iOS, thats another story, Apple manufactures iPhone and developes a OS which works perfectly with that device, which, supposedly, makes it safer. There ends all iOS and iPhone REAL advantages. There are a lot of reason to say Android is better than Android, but the main reason is that you can freely add and delete files from it. I connect my Android to my computer, I press “Windows key” + “E” and immediately I see all my drives and my Android device there, and I can drag or delete files from it. But when I connect an iPhone I have sync up files with iTunes. Why the hell people think synchronization is good? For example, I spent one week adding all my music from CDs to my iTunes library, then I synced my iPhone and… voilá, my music was there. Then my computer died, and my music adquired during years with my money was completely lost, just because I didn’t buy it to Apple. But hey, music was still on my iphone, but NO, I need a third party program, which costs money or could be a malware, just to upload my songs again to a new computer. (Of course I have all my CDs, but thats a week lost) Im simply asking you to do like me if you can, just try everything, because if I read this article (iPhone is better, iPhone is better, iPhone is better…) I have the feeling that not everyone, but many people conform with iPhone. Just for popularity, for Apple fanaticism, or just because a website is telling you to buy it with superliminal advertising. 09/26/2016 wgallagher142 Reply I actually find that android apps have become much prettier and definitely more modern than iPhone apps at this point.

I plug the phone to any pc or laptop with Windows and I can access and modify the memory and sd card just like you do with an USB flash drive. 2) probably my favourite Android feat: if I don’t like a new update for an App I just download the previous version (you can get the whole updates hystory as .apk files of virtually every single app found in Google Play on the web) and there I have my dear older version that works so much better for me.

I have been a heavy android user till date until yesterday when I bought iPhone 7 plus. I own an iPad since two years. I am happy with my iPad which I use mainly for games and some handwriting. Yes I was annoyed from android. I owned s3. It had, due to some reason, a built in issue which I only realized after warranty finished. My faulty s3 obliged me to hate Samsung and android. Then I bought note 4. It solved all my problems I faced on s3. But still there were some things I did not feel good about. Now after purchasing iPhone 7plus 128 GB I understand the power of google. The three apps Google search, google maps and google drive are enough reason to close down iPhone factory from the face of earth. 10/10/2016 BM Reply Thinking to upgrade from s5. Thought for iPhone 7. But it can not do even 5 % work compared to android. My andrioid mobile automatically silents itself when I enter meetings or office. Automatic meeting mode when meeting is scheduled (only beeps) I can give my mobile to anyone to see coz I have app specific fingerprint. Only sensitive apps are protected. All other is open. These are not possible with apple except jailbreak. These are just samples. I can write journal what android can do. Speed is not important with a Ibrick which can not do anything smart. I’m not a fan of apple or Samsung. I want my work to be done and my pocket secretary to work according to my requirements. 10/10/2016 Charles Alden Reply 15 reasons why Android is better. Reason number one, you have an actual file system. Anyone who has dealt with iOS horrendous file management paradigm appreciates the ease as at which files are accessible in Android. You simply click on Open, navigate to where your files are stored, select, done. There is also never any reason to use the Share function except when sharing data with the internet. Number 2, multitasking, iOS’s multitasking absolutely sucks, especially when you compare it to Android. Example, I can stream a film to my TV wirelessly, while compiling an application via a remote terminal, while downloading a 40GB file directly to my NAS drive which is mounted as a local folder, while I convert a media file to .mp4, while I play N64, 007 Goldfinger using a replica N64 USB game controller. I’m able to select my own default apps, so when I download a file and click open, the app that I normally use for that extension opens up automatically. I have a global search function, which is one of the worst things about iOS, how do you find files. That was rhetoric, you can’t, it’s basically hunt and peck. I can customize voice commands, this is perhaps one of the coolest things about about Android. I have around 250 custom voice commands, mostly for searching files. Such as, “show me all file [file extension] created on [date]. Even photos, show me all photos from [city] on [particular date/month, years], even for a particular person , “show me all photos for [name] on [particular date/month, year]” External display support, when am connect my phone to a monitor not only is the resolution fully supported but so is the aspect ratio. Mouse support, while connected to a monitor I can use a mouse and a keyboard. Even when not connected to a phone, having access to a mouse is an absolute must when using a tablet as a laptop. USB peripheral support, so besides mouse support, my phone supports a TB external HD, HP All-In-One printer in which the scanner even works, USB replica game controllers in which a have one for the N64, SNES, Sega and PlayStation. Better overall specs, I have a 2K AMOLED display, 6GB of RAM, USB C, SD Card reader, HDMI out support, etc. I can use a custom desktop LDPI, I changed my LDPI to 380 which is the LDPI that activates tablet mode, which means all of my apps are a lot more powerful than the normal phone UI ones. I can customize my entire system to what I want it to be, give it personality, iOS users have been using the same system UI for the last 9 years. There is absolutely nothing I can’t customize. Inner app communication is a lot better, since iOS has a Walled off prison, or so called Walled Garden, apps communicate via API’s, which is the root of everything wrong within iOS. Anyway as stated above, I don’t have to use some half assed sharing function which creates a copy of the file your sharing every time you use it to open up my files within multiple apps, I simply click on Open. I can even open up the same file within multiple apps at the same time. I never, ever have to create more than one file, I just use the original file, always. I can use Linux under a Chroot, meaning I have a full Debian server running under my phone. Why would you want this, well first of all I have CLI applications like; Python, Perl, PHP, MySQL, Apache, etc. I have all of my favorite Linux GUI applications installed like; Dia, Inkscape, Gimp, BlueFish, etc. I can use my phone as a desktop computer, this one might sound weird but not only is it possible, it works incredibly well. Especially when my phone has 6GB of RAM and a Qualcomm 821. Like I said above I have all of my favorite Linux GUI applications installed in which a bring them up using a xterminal, when I’m at work I have access to about a hundred different Windows applications via a Citrix client which works fantastically. All of my applications including the ndroid ones are opened up in individual windows, so none of that dual app view non-sense. In which in iOS less than 0.5% out of a million plus apps actually support. I have access to widgets, they might not interest you but they are extremely handy. I can use wireless chargers. I can use custom ROMs, even completely different OS’s like Ubuntu Touch, SailFish, etc. I will never, ever not be able to run the latest version of Android. When a manufacturer stops updating their phone, no problem, I just install a custom ROM and they work fantastically. My phone is a computer, a real powerhouse, a real smartphone. Every time I use an iPhone I absolutely hate the experience. I mean even to type a post like this I would have to use a text editor as I would be afraid to loose all of my work as anytime you switch to another app, Safari just resets. It has happened to me numerous times, it’s why sites have started saving drafts, not for the Android users but iOS users. Though what bothers me the most is the lack of multitasking, yes, sure, there are a few apps that can run in the background but they are far and few and none of them are the ones that I need or want to use. Than there is the file system or I should say lack of, dealing with files IOS is simply a complete nightmare. Anytime someone at the office who uses an iPhone gets sassy with me about having an Android phone I simply ask them to show me their user directory, what, you can’t mount it, why not, your phone is so great. Not only do I have my remote server directly mounted as a local directory on my phone but my workstation and all of my cloud services as well, all accessible within any app installed. Again, my phone is also my desktop computer and why not, it’s not only powerful enough but more than capable. I couldn’t believe how horrible the external display support was on my iPad Pro, which I recently replaced with a Lenovo YogaBook, best decision I ever made. Talk about a complete makeover on how I work, I’m actually productive now. I can create detailed reports, all in the background and automatically, I have access to a scripting language, automation, multi-user support with OpenID to access my firms internal network, a real Office suite, MS Office for iOS was a complete joke, there isn’t even a import feature, scripting language, nope, database support, nope, by the way, I have the Android version. Which opens up every app under their own window, iOS’s dual app support on the iPad Pro was a joke, hardly anything supports it and that drag and drop feature, only apps designed by the same developer can use it, so MS Word to MS Excel yes, MS Word to Apple photos, no, useless. Yes, my post is huge, but this authors best 15 reasons why the iPhone is a joke. Almost everything listed I have on either my Yoga Book or new Xiaomi Mi 5s Plus or don’t need it as it’s a waste. In fact 90% of the so called new features in iOS 10 are useless. I held on to my iPad Pro thinking iOS 10 would be a game changer, not only was it not, but there wasn’t a single feature that improved my experience. Apple keeps skipping over every feature that we actually want, need. If your happy with multitasking, file management, the fact that you can’t select your own default apps, lack of customizations, horrible external display support, lack of USB C, limited NFC, horrible USB peripheral support, especially mouse support. Horrible inner app communication including the Sharing function in which took Apple 8 years to even release that crap, ugh, the list just goes on and on and …………. 10/11/2016 Gigi Reply This is one of the most biased articles I have ever read on complementing Apple. I am an adult, I don’t need Apple to limit what I can do with my phone and what I can share and who I can share with. I have used Iphone before and it surely not my cup of tea. 10/12/2016 Emma squire Reply Okay Listen what I think is that you have written an article telling the blank truth of your mind. But you see I have an iPhone 6s,iPod 5,MacBook air, MacBook Pro, Samsung TV with built in smart tv, Samsung galaxy tablet pro and I don’t mind Samsung to be truthful. Also I find that Apple is more easier to use but harder to switch from an iOS device to an LGphone.

One can truly say that iPhone is way more better than android. ..though we need to invest some bucks unlike android phones. 😀 10/14/2016 Huen Reply iOS is superior to Android. I was suckered in buying 2 android devices the samsung galaxy s3 and the nexus 4. I gave it a try because my friends raved about android. They are smart people who generally have great advice and knowledge on technology. So I said I’ll give it a shot because they have good judgement. However I found out that their judgement were out of biased hatred toward apple. Android devices: 1. on paper they have more ram, sometimes quicker cpu clock speed, higher resolution etc. however real life performance tests apple out scores android devices, just check geek bench and speed tests. As for higher resolution our eyes dont even detect the larger resolutions. 2. I found out the hard way, downloaded apps that just didnt work for my device. Google needs to improve this I dont know if they are better now but man they need to detect the hardware your using and tell you ahead of time before you download and install an app that its compatible with your device! 3. customizations my butt!! Its a great idea so called if all your launchers actually look good! haha I tried all these loaders for my s3 and they were all ugly. Just go with apple, its like saying would you hire great designers for your house and you would just let them have their way in designing the house for you or would you want to design it yourself? doesnt make sense look at xiaomi great example they just copy everything apple does and it looks great. Dont hire cheap designers to design the way your phone looks and works. 4. OS – android’s solution to everything is “oh just download this app to make it work or oh just kill this task or reduce brightness or this or that” why?! If I’m paying 1k for a phone why does it not just work? Why must I non stop have to tweak things on my phone to get save battery or make things work? For instance for whatsapp there was no function built into the app that when I want to send a larger video than that of the given limit on a video it just rejects it. On iOS whatsapp gives you a little function that u can just cut the video into segments and send them in separate messages? This sounds like it can be something that is on the app level. I dont know but as for end user experience its just not convenient you need to download another app that will cut videos in segments for you this is retarded. 5. battery life just sucks on android – and my friend is all like well it works for me…well that’s because he had to buy a new battery that was double the size and totally threw out the idea of having a sleek thin phone. Theres on and on the list goes android and samsung devices are not superior devices. The features samsung lovers speak of are just gimmicks. Keyboards, widgets, notifications honestly who cares? Especially when widgets just take down performance on your phone? I just dont see any benefits on android especially the argument went something like this: “oh android phones are cheaper for superior hardware” Like I said hardware maybe superior on PAPER but in real life benchmarks iphones outshine samsung and htc and other top tier android devices. By the way prices are not cheaper anymore so android fanboys have no actual argument. Like I said I tried android and they are not superior phones both hardware and software. Aesthetically Android phones are ugly. You now pay a premium price on sub premium products, and they explode. lol 10/20/2016 Jamezz_ Reply Sure. A Samsung or LG’s phone software is ugly. But stock android?! Android 6.0 stock? It’s an extraordinary interface with origami-style apps. The geometry with the shadows and vibrant colors is beautiful. The app drawer is simple, and you can put the apps you use on your home screen. Android’s advantage is software. iSheep are just too autistic to use it. 10/16/2016 Cmi Reply I have both!

No comparison.anybody who stands in line for the new iPhone is absolutely getting the shaft and not even getting the best product , it’s laughable! 10/18/2016 George Brite Reply Great article. Over the years I’ve had both. Even a couple of Macs. I use PC’s now because I like being able to work on them and build my own. For the average user the I Phone is a better choice. They are simple and work well. Here’s the big negatives for me: The hardware and software are proprietary. In fact the phones are sealed. You can’t install an extended battery. No SD slot. No root access. Comparable Android phones cost a lot less. The Android phones natively work with Google Apps. We use our phones in the business. If I were a casual user it wouldn’t matter if it were a Trac Phone or an I Phone. We use the Google phones and Motorola phones. They run pure Android without all the carrier bloatware. I like to say Apple invented the smartphone, but Google perfected it. It’s like the choice between a toaster oven and a microwave or a full commercial kitchen. Most people will get along fine with the toaster and microwave. They don’t need a commercial kitchen. But, what if you could get the full commercial kitchen for the same price as the toaster and microwave? Everyone has an opinion about which is better. But trust me when I say this isn’t a choice between chocolate and vanilla. There are very distinct differences between the Android and Apple phones. 10/21/2016 ZinicHD Reply Wtf, apps never ever releases on iOS first. It always releases on android first. Also app updates releases on android first, so that’s kind of bullshit what you are saying. The only thing iOS beats android in is security and stability. Also you can get virus scanners on android, so that thing doesn’t matter. And one thing more, who ever uses FaceTime or iMessage, when we have messenger, Skype ect… And that point when you said that iOS stock apps was the stupidest crap I have ever heard. First of all it was a shit point, what are you gonna need the looks for? Second is that not everyone thinks it look better, so keep that mind. I am a iOS user and I am so disappointed that you can’t even customize the most of the things. I have to admit that the design of iOS is pretty nice, but you get quick tired of it. That’s why I jailbreaked my device to get the ability to customize it more professionally. But I don’t compare a android device and a jailbroken device, because jailbreaking is not something that comes with Apple. iOS is also very expensive compared to android devices. And checking storage on android is way more organized than iOS, so I don’t know where you get that idea that checking storage on iOS is better. 10/22/2016 Bent Vanwijnsberghe Reply the lightning port part is bs i have an iphone (looking for a new phone android) and there are around me on my desk already 3 micro usb and 1 lightning port witch costs around 40 bucks for a new one 10/25/2016 Selenia Reply Terrible article by an obvious fanboy. You are listing many things, like lack of carrier or manufacturer bloatware, reversible charging plug, seamless sharing, etc and saying they are exclusive to Apple. Try Googling USB-C, the current standard on any higher range Android, some still cheaper than an iDevice. Try a Nexus, or as of this year, Pixel phone. No bloat, Android as Google intended it. That would be a more fair comparison as those are at least close in the chain to Google, like an iPhone is to Apple. That is, instead of being made by some company who may not even care how it represents Android, build quality, and other important things, instead of pure profit(not say all non Nexus/Pixel phones are bad by any means, but some do give Android a bad name with poor specs and modified/outdated versions of Android). Seamless sharing? Ever hear of WiFi Direct, Bluetooth, or NFC? NFC is the simplest. Just hit share and tap. All but the cheapest Androids have that these days. Anyways, I am convinced you have never used a decent Android, ever. Certainly not one from Google themselves. I will leave you to tend to your iFlock. 10/30/2016 MzJens Reply For android, I think google products like nexus & pixel are much better than samsung. However, I noticed a lot of crappy apps available on google play that doesn’t work. Some apps require root access which only advance users should do. Android interface is not as intuitive as iOS. Some android apps hang. I’ve never had ios apps hang on me 11/10/2016 Pixleboy2 Reply “You have to try multiple attempts before putting the charger in at the right angle” 1. If you do it in a lit environment you will get it in first try because the micro USB shape is easy to see 2. If you are in the dark: And have an official Samsung charger – there will be a “bumps letting you know which way to put it and the only thing that can go wrong is you missing the port, which is possible on iPhone too. And have any old micro USB – there are two, normal, ways to insert it horizontally upside down and horizontally the correct way both 180 degree angles so please don’t exaggerate it. Finally Samsung cares about you that’s why they use micro USB. This may seem weird but basically to legally make a lightning USB cable you need a licence from Apple and Apple only have their own unique charger to earn more profit, that’s why apple chargers are always more expensive, because they are sold by Apple or the retailer needs to make his money back from the licence fare. P.S. Samsung devices come with a 1 year warranty for free and because it’s Samsung you can get cheaper insurance than their one (yes they have one) P.P.S. Sharing has always been easier on android to anything because you could share with a variety of options such as Bluetooth, NFC, messaging app, other third party apps, S share (Samsung own “air drop” that came out in Android version 4.1.3 BI7 – before Ios 7 Also the settings icon is useful, it’s like apple not making the send button on messages 3d touch to send so you don’t accidently press it, sure sometimes you send half written messages but it is more convenient and normal to have it to a single normal touch. And there is a difference between apps looking better and having more features on Apple which are usually hardware based, I just brought this up because no matter who you ask if you compare a Samsung phone with its equivalent iPhone generation, Samsung phones ALWAYS have better displays and MOSTLY have better cameras. Samsung phones are also very comfortable, for example I am writing this on a Samsung galaxy s7 edge There is a setting that allows the micro sd card to be added as side by side storage Finally Samsung has always had earphone controls so either I read it wrong that you said these are things we will miss very much or you are really confused 11/12/2016 Tetsuokenpachi Reply Each and every single of these are false. Android is actually better in every single of these areas. From the first to the last one. Worse yet, many of these points are actually some of the very reasons why idevices absolutely suck. 11/16/2016 Billy Sastard Reply apple is crap, these idiots make their products so expensive, but android is cheaper and has alot of awesome features.android is also WAY more customisable, with out necessarily rooting your device.And if you do, you can do almost anything from installing apps to changing your software. 11/16/2016 Calculadora Gestacional Reply I think both of them are just great! 11/16/2016 Caleb Reply The update can still download on older Apple products, because I have a IPad 2 that came out in 2011 and it still receives all of the latest updates.

Was amazed to see how much progress android has made and makes my iphone look so limited. I am aware that android tends to slow down over time but that is yet to happen to me. For now the openness of android is amazing as it is giving me a computer like experience while iOS still strictly behaves like a mobile device only. Classic hurt points being in iphone /iOS being No expandable memory No dual sim version (i travel internationally and need this frequently) Unable to use lastpass like apps the same way as in android (and keychain is BS, BTW) Simple things like themes unavailable Very less system wide control Very limited customisation I can go on but i think unless my expensive edge can give me same performance as now for ATLEAST 2 years, i’ll eat my words back But, the 15 points mentioned here are almost all very unconvincing. 11/17/2016 Philip Reply Apple are just simple phones no really fancy stuff I have had two Android phone I love their features but not their battery life which is crappie I have had two Apple iPods and two iPhone they were the 4 32 GB & 5s 64 GB now on Android your apps get updated every 3 months on Apple sometimes twice a week IOS updates are twice month at least I bought my iPhone 5s 64 GB which started with iOS 7 in 2014 now it got iOS 10.1.1 it seems the IOS are getting worse not better it freezes crashes most apps lot of the app you can’t even post two year let alone one day old photo I can get on my Samsung Galaxy S3 with 3 year old photos on it and post photos off it to any app only reason I like the small iPhones I can collect lot photos that way I can post to my apps like now I got over 106K photos on my 5s 64 GB which you can’t do with big phones only problems I got with iPhones are updates on apps and IOS’S like this month iOS 10.2 supposedly be coming out it seems the new IOS’s don’t really fixing any problems you get on your iPhone it just give you different problems while you still have the same old problems you also got figure Apple iPhones are about 3 years behind Android phones on new ideals 11/18/2016 Nick Reply Apple!?

From the moment you boot up ios, there are restrictions to what you can do with your phone. Can you flash IOS9 to iphone4s? Guess what, my old galaxy s2 is already running marshmallow like a charm and i think both of them were released in the same year. and i am in the process of flashing Latest nougat 7.1 cyanogenmod version on my s6 edge. You are writing about malware crap which is misleading. New android versions since lollipop allow users to modify app permissions but i think you are so caught up in app constrained ecosystem, you didn’t noticed. IOS isn’t secure anymore as we thought it was. Su vulnerability has already been fixed and there is no more stagefright bug in android. And you obviously have no idea about the difference between android based phones and android phones. Most of the Phones from samsung, htc, sony etc run Custom Android based OS, They are actually custom build port of android, not real android phones, so obviously there will be some issues too if you try to port IOS on samsung. A high end smartphone can go head to head with iphone in each and every aspect. My s6 edge is not even a tad slower than iphone 6, in fact, it performs even better. The slowdown overtime can be experience on low end smartphone. Obviously the one writing this comment has no idea about fstrim. Stop posting such nonsense crap in order to get traffic to your website. 11/25/2016 ashford Reply I have never once had a problem with android phones, but decided to switch it up as IPhones are the ‘in thing’ It was okay for a few months, but soon started having plenty of issues with speed, memory and doing basic things. I decided to upgrade it to the 7, which turned out to be just as bad. For the price, they should be giving people something amazing, not mediocrity! P.S. How much did they apple pay you for such a bad article. 12/03/2016 Brandon McLean Reply You didn’t mention how Apple has a much smaller battery, late software updates, unneeded restrictions, is insanely overpriced, and most of all, Apples processor specs come in at a fraction of what Androids of the same price have, AKA 1.6 GHZ (Apple iPhones) vs 2.4 GHZ (ASUS, Galaxy S7, OnePlus all running Android), 2 GB of RAM (Apple) vs 4 GB of RAM (Android). Android is by far the superior technology. Your only argument is that Android uses Google’s superior sharing system, rather than their own like Apple does. 12/14/2016 Keith Llewellyn Reply For me, it’s all about security, and Apple has the best. Also, if you buy an iPhone you get updates and support for a couple of years more than Google provides for it’s own Nexus or Pixel phones. Two years worth of updates for the OS and Three years for security updates FROM THE DATE OF FIRST INTRODUCTION is totally inadequate. It means that you have to buy a new google phone from the date it is first available in order to really benefit from the updates. 12/27/2016 Apple Marketing Machine Reply Let’s compare the “core” features of a new iphone to a 2 year old android phone: iphone 7 plus – Released 2016, September Samsung Galaxy Note 4 – Released 2014, October iphone 7 plus – 1080 x 1920 pixels (~401 ppi pixel density) Samsung Galaxy Note 4 – 1440 x 2560 pixels (~518 ppi pixel density) iphone 7 plus – Quad-core 2.23 GHz Samsung Galaxy Note 4 – Quad-core 2.7 GHz iphone 7 plus – 12 MP camera Samsung Galaxy Note 4 – 16 MP camera iphone 7 plus – Non-removable Li-Ion 2900 mAh battery Samsung Galaxy Note 4 – Removable Li-Ion 3220 mAh battery okay…you can have your “better looking apps”. 12/28/2016 MACKabiVIPer42 Reply Yes Android phones are better everything wise but iPhone battery is better last as long as up to 3 to 4 years Samsung last up to 6 months I know had S3 and HTC 1 still got S3 3rd battery it’s just iPod on second iPhone first one was iPhone 4 32 GB lasted 4 years got iPhone 5s 64 GB it’s over 2 yrs old but don’t use for taking photos just for collecting photos which small iPhone can collect up too 100K photos like my iPhone 5s I’m not SELFIE PERSON where I got take photo of my self in every window mirror and bathroom I love stealing other people photos like Anime ladies in bikinis to post on my other apps even Animals if they are cute enough yes Apple do make there apps crappie and there IOS’s also which crashes and freezes a lot then half time you can’t post photos or articles from your e-mail too the apps but I take Apple for small phone over android big phone 03/06/2017 iAlex Reply More pixels require more energy and chip performance.

This list is pure “i don’t like it so that means android is bad” and “its apple so whatever it does it’s genius”. if you’ve ever ACTUALLY went from crapple to android (unlike 99% of the comments here that say they have but in reality… well) you would notice a LOT of improvements over crapple. 1: The price to quality ratio is MUCH better that apple’s. 2: More customisation options. Unless you count changing your phone cover as “customizing”. 3: It’s not apple, so it’s better (see what i did there? I did the shit apple fanboy’s do) 4: No dumb “inovations”. 5: Simplifying things and making something that takes 3 seconds isn’t better, Sony, Samsung etc focus on more important things to improve. 03/06/2017 iAlex Reply Well you sound like Forest Gump in his movie when he said that his friend opened Apple company for selling fruits….

But if you’re like majority of people and have a Windows computer that’s a lie. I installed iTunes once and my computer was never the same again.

I have a android galaxy tab 3 and the iPod 6 generation and if I was to choose which is better it’s definitely Apples product and I never would get an android again. When I got my android new at Walmart it couldn’t even get the latest version, it was completely unbelievable. After I had it for 3 months it slowed down on me and its battery life is horrible. Now when I bought this IPod new I’ve had it for a double the time now and it works like new and best of all it can get the latest version. The quality of Apple is way better. In my opinion the iPhone is the best visual quality I’ve seen yet. Ive done some decent gaming on them and if you want something to save your progress then forget android, because not all the game link to your google play account so if you reset it the ones that don’t link are gone. Unlike apple I haven’t had any issues with it. I’ve lost decent money and progress on android because of it. Yes Apple does come out with the newest technology a bit latter then android but you can see it it a good way or a bad. The bad way would be that their slow, the good way you can see it as if their watching googles failing parts and their making it better. 01/03/2017 Marcelino Reply Also I can see you all are fighting over this topic which is pretty stupid. To be honest you can’t necessarily compare them. Everyone is different so everyone is going to want something different. If we all wanted android or we all wanted Apple we would become robots. If you wanted to find a phone to get then get into inside detail to see what your looking for. If you wanted fun texting and want to be more secure then go straight for apple because they got the best for that but if you wanted fun lock screens or be able to put micro SD cards and changeable batteries then go for android but let me remind you that anyone can take the SD card out and take your information. Hope this helps. 01/04/2017 LOREN FOK Reply people will buy iphone just because thats what everyone else has they dont even know what they are buying.

Most of the alleged superiorities are interoperabilty between iPhones (iMessage, Airdrop) or between iPhone and other Apple devices (Handoff) – if you are a PC owner, or have a large number of friends or fellow users on Android, these advantages are insignificant at best. I will concede that updates and lack of carrier bloatware are significant pluses, the author is doing an extreme disservice to new users by basically promoting an iPhone prejudice. 01/31/2017 Matt Perkins Reply iPhones win over Android smartphones for these 5 critical reasons. Security, Privacy, Stability, Performance and Usability. iOS gets far less malware than Android, it has far less critical vulnerabilities than Android. Vulnerabilities are patched quicker in iOS. iOS crashes and freezes less than Android, Apple doesn’t harvest data to sell like Google does (Google has even started collecting identifiable data since they released their new voice assistant). iOS is a faster OS than Android is while Android smartphones slow down faster than the iPhone does. And of course iOS offers the better out of box experience. Not to mention you can never make Android as secure as iOS, only close to as secure. Part of the reason is even if you tweak your Android settings to be similar to iOS, the official Google Play Store gets far more malware than the AppStore and Cydia combined. So only way to even remotely match it is not download apps or games. My other favorite part of iOS over Android is the fact you can use true adblockers in iOS, not just adblock browsers without the need to root or jailbreak. Google will never allow you to block ads in Chrome or block all ads third party ads without rooting. And as you knowing rooting and jailbreaking merely lowers the security of the OS. That’s another thing Jailbroken iOS is more secure than untouched Android as long as you stick to the default repos in Cydia. 02/01/2017 Shaun Anderson Reply Android Download from unknown sources like a regular computer Download files from browser Plug in and transfer anything to and from computer.

Who really cares if the poor sods on the other side of the world live the lives of slaves? Who cares if they have to stand ALL day, and ASK for pissbreaks? Who cares if the companies solution to suicides are suicide nets around buildings and removing knives? Who cares if the iphone costs a dollar to make, but sold for $600?

I’ve had every version of the iPhone. I’ve never had an Android phone update properly. My 3 year old plays on my old 2nd gen iPhone that has the latest IOS on it. . .. android can’t do that. with the exception of a Verizon flip phone, every single Android phone I’ve ever had got a virus, crashed and I had to reset to factory settings at least 2 times per phone. I have never, ever ever got a virus on ANY Apple product, and never had to put any software or app to keep it running correctly. As far as customization? Who cares. If you’re so busy and have so much time to waste trying to impress everyone with crazy fonts and wild customization, the iPhone is way to sleek, sophisticated and user -friendly for you. Software dictates hardware. The IOS blows Android OS away. And, any (anyone who’s actually worked on both will agree) Apple product gets sometimes twice the speed out of less RAM and processing than ANY other OS (Windows or Android). Give me stability anytime. so your phone has an expandable memory? What good is it when it won’t run half the time. Have a nice day all. . .. .after all, they’re just phones. . .. right? 02/19/2017 Richie Reply Some things to add (pros and cons) as a PC & Android guy that just switched to iPhone (but I’m staying on PC): 1) The iOS versions of Microsoft apps are better than the Android ones and they work great. 2) Article is correct: the iOS versions of apps are generally better than their Android counterparts, in ways you will notice. It’s really kind of a shame for Android – I don’t get why they don’t just match the exact app. 3) Lightning is neat but I found MicroUSB more useful, since it’s used for more devices, i.e. I have a MicroUSB running from my desk to my PC to charge my wireless mouse, and then I would also use it to charge my phone sometimes. 4) Yes I do miss customization heaven with Android, but this iPhone runs like total butter. Android runs WELL but this thing is so zippy and responsive – you wouldn’t believe it until you spent time with one. 5) ALSO customization isn’t as cut-off as it used to be with iOS. Some apps can latch onto some functions in the phone, kinda like installing an extension for your desktop browser. It’s something. Really I just bought an iPhone to “try something new” and I’m really liking it. 02/28/2017 Toby Reply Just do a Quick google search iphone is less reliable than Android, theres your Answer in the studies.

Also to feel the power and beauty of technology in your hand. How I wished that Isaac Newton or Ainstein or Nikola Tessa or… would see what we have today… Second: iPhone is far more serious for people who want job to be done as fast and simpler way without delays. Android phones are for kids who like customizations and pretty colors and to look like iron man or similar… Third: iPhone is made of better materials. And looks for business high class. Android phones are copying iPhone’s look especially Samsung. Fourth: iPhone technology, the software and hardware gives you exactly what you need. No more no less. Android technologies gives you extra things which are seldom used and are simply extra using more battery and device performance. Fifth: iPhone has a specific style in design. Keeping updating same style to better one making it each time better and better. Sixth: Applications on iPhone are much better with much less defects than Android. At the end, I had various Samsung, Sony, Huawei, Htc and iPhone phones. I choose iPhone. Now I have iPhone 6s+ black limited edition with golden Apple. It’s very nice piece of equipment. at the bottom line, Apollo 11 travelled to the moon using Fortan on its 360 kb computer. Today we are talking of gigs bytes.

It should have been either ios vs android or iphone vs samsung,moto,etc. Agreed iPhones are best 03/30/2017 XORRO Reply I have just crossed the divide from a nexus 6 to an iphone 7 plus. Reason 1: os not supported by google now for updates Reason 2: android still not working properly version 7.0 … come on!! I have found iphone apps work better. System is super quick. Everything seems to work how it is supposed to without strange errors. I am getting on with doing what i have to without googling why something isnt working properly. Photo app is amazing. Web sites load really fast. I am now an Apple convert! The price difference is negligible now but the performance is chalk and cheese. 03/31/2017 kunt Reply how dumb are you?

Great arguments.

I hated it, probably because it was really old and complicated. When I got an iPhone 5, I really liked the simplicity of it. The apps were way better and was less laggy. 04/09/2017 Lucie Reply There are so many nonsense comments on this list . … iphone works better with your devices??? Lol if like to see that, yeah maybe if all your other devices are apple!! I can name about 50 reasons android is better than I Phone…. I have owned both and wouldn’t use an i phone if it was gifted to me !!! 04/10/2017 Brandon Reply It seems idiotic to buy an IPhone. You can get a phone with the same specifications(Processor, RAM, ROM, Battery) for $120, where it would cost $800 from Apple. You can get phones that are no joke, 5x faster for half the price. 04/12/2017 Jerry Reply Sure apple’s phones die quickly but wanna know why… Because people actually like using them so they go on the a lot more than android. 04/12/2017 Kyle Reply Jerry is right. 04/18/2017 Robert Smith Reply IPHONE :- Pros Hardware and software both controlled and optimized by Apple Curated app store, fewer worries of malware Generally good support Cons No expandable storage Walled-garden ecosystem Limited customisation ANDROID :- Pros Open source, easily customized Expandable storage on many phones Wider choice of phones Cons Higher chance of malware Interface not the same on all phones Patchy support 04/19/2017 Steve Bonser Reply Most of your “reasons” are bogus ravings of yet another member of Cult Apple. 04/23/2017 Mitchell Reply This hole story is a joke if you look at the specs alone they are better look at the iPhone 7 no headphone jack come on removing a universal jack wow and also they are very over price and that second hand price part was pure crap I just look it up the iPhone are cheaper second the Samsung’s were a higher price in second hand condition. In conclusion I would recommend not to by and apple computer and or iPhone because of the very expensive repair price and the child proofing of there iPhones that is the only reason why they are prone not to getting viruses they are limited and closed it is very sad. whating for the apple fan boys to attack this comment with some more ”facts” 04/25/2017 Yorvos Nirnaven Reply 14 reasons why iPhones are better? Me and my brother just finished reading this article and were laughing hysterically through every single reason. My guess is that you’re a loyal iPhone fanatic who tried an Android phone for a week and didn’t understand it. You even used some funny tactics to make the iPhone look better in every photo, like using a small Galaxy model next to a large iPhone, with iPhone on full brightness and the Android one at around half. That’s a little sleazy. First of all, you said iPhone apps update sooner and are pretty. That was true MANY years ago before Android was the dominant OS. The reverse is usually true, as most developers prioritize on Android because more people use it. ‘Fast iPhone updates for all…’ For one thing, the same is true on newer Android phones, which constantly receive updates just like iPhones. Sure, older Android phones no longer receive the newest updates… but neither do old iPhones. Does anyone here have an iPhone 4 running ios 10? I thought so. Also, major ios updates tend to make the soon-to-be obsolete iPhone model so slow that it’s unusable. It’s happened to me and others I know, to the iPhone 4 and the 5… and soon to the 6, so they can force you to upgrade to the newest polished turd they churn out. The next one made me laugh so hard that I got sharp pains in my stomach. Thanks for that. “Works great with all your devices” Sure, IF YOU HAVE ALL APPLE DEVICES, just like my Windows Phone works great with my Windows PC. Android works well with Windows, and Linux, and… everything else, except Apple’s computers. In fact, no Apple device can integrate with anything other than another Apple device. It’s just a circular logic-sustained monopoly. If you’ve fallen for it, good for you, but don’t try to use such non-logic to persuade others. The article argues that Android’s inclusion of carrier bundled apps depending on the manufacturer makes it inferior. Most people don’t like the carrier apps, but guess what, you can uninstall them or not use them. You couldn’t, however, uninstall Apple’s bundled apps until very recently. The only apps on Android you cannot uninstall are the system apps. The article then point’s out Apple’s iPhone warranty. What’s funny is… You can get the same with many Android manufacturers, but you can also choose not to. After all, a warranty, like any other insurance business model, makes responsible users who do not break their phones subsidize those who do break their phones. The ‘sharing to other iPhones’… Just like you can share to other Android phones on your Android phone, not to mention the fact that Android’s sharing options are more extensive and easier to use. So, that’s a downside on Apple’s part:] “Worth more when you resell” This was another wildly hilarious one. Can you guess why iPhones resell at a higher value? It’s because they’re more expensive in the first place! Higher resell value is just a not-so-clever way of spinning the fact that iPhones are extremely expensive. Again, a downside on the iPhone’s part. Lightning miles better than Micro USB? First of all, an entirely subjective statement. The Lightning cord was unpopular for a reason. It’s just a way for Apple to make more money, forcing people to throw away their old cables and buy new ones. That’s just crappy business. Also, I personally think Micro USB is much better, because they’re very versatile and widely used, and are compatible with ANYTHING else USB. Like the mighty kraken, Apple has a way of grabbing you and pulling you into their ecosystem, choking you to death by consistently overcharging you for mediocre hardware. Apple stores for support? You mean like the equivalent support you can get from most Android phone manufacturers, MINUS the cheap rates and competition? That sounds FAR superior! The next argument is over ‘ease of use’. First of all, most/all functions common to both operating systems are performed just as easily on Android. The ease of use argument only exists because some of the things you can do on Android, but not iPhone, can be difficult. Because the fact is, Android is so much more customize-able. You can install new themes, you can use file managers, you can manually install app packages, and much, much more. Some of these things take learning, but at least you can do them in the first place. If you just want an Android to use as a phone, you can do so just as easily. Ease of use is just another way of saying you cannot do anything advanced on IOS. “HEADPHONE CONTROLS!” Newsflash: they work on Android too. It’s fully supported on every Android device I’ve tried, and i’ve tried some really old ones. ‘iMessage, FaceTime and FaceTime Audio’ There are good, equivalent services on Android. Better control of notification? The way they are handled on Android is quite similar, and different types of notification ARE separated on Android, so I don’t know what you’re trying to say there. Storage use and carrier options: It’s funny that the author uses ‘choice’ as one of his arguments. You can get most/all of the same options plus more on Android. It’s also funny how you decided to name Andoid’s common acceptance of SD cards a negative. You wrote that you can move some but not all apps to the SD card as a negative. Obviously, because you should not be able to move essential system apps to an external device. At least you can choose external storage in most Android phones, which cannot be done on a one size fits all iPhone. This post was pathetic, mostly because every single argument is a non-argument, or reflects negatively on iPhones. It does provide a good laugh, though.

The Apple store in San Francisco. (Foster + Partners Photo) As Apple builds out a new store in Seattle’s University Village Mall, the company is gearing up to revamp its top stores around the world. Angela Ahrendts, Apple’s senior vice president of retail and leader of the redesign projects, appeared on CBS This Morning Tuesday and outlined the changes coming to Apple’s top 100 stores around the world. She described the architecture of the store itself as the hardware, and what happens inside as software. Many aspects of the redesign carry over from changes to Apple’s flagship San Francisco store unveiled last year. The two-story store features 42-by-40-foot sliding glass doors that allow the store to become part of the outdoor space. Changes at stores will include new screens, trees and other landscaping and spaces set aside for meetings and classes. The famous Genius Bar is getting a makeover as well. It will be called Genius Grove, and it will have staffers specializing in things like music and photography. Apple announced this morning plans to launch dozens of new educational sessions in May in all 495 Apple stores ranging in topics from photo and video to music, coding, art and design and more. The programs, known as “Today at Apple,” will in some cities feature well-known artists, photographers and musicians, teaching sessions from basics and how-to lessons to professional-level classes. The construction site at University Village, adjacent to the current Apple store. (GeekWire Photo / Nat Levy) The redesign and new educational programs aim to make Apple stores more welcoming and appealing to a broader set of customers. “We’re creating a modern-day town square, where everyone is welcome in a space where the best of Apple comes together to connect with one another, discover a new passion, or take their skill to the next level,” Ahrendts said. GeekWire recently uncovered permit documents indicating a new Apple store is going up in Seattle’s University Village mall. The blueprints show several of these new concepts included in the redesign, including trees in the store and meeting spaces. An architect listed on documents for the Seattle project — Foster + Partners — designed the San Francisco location. Apple opened the University Village location in 2003, approximately two years after the company opened its first brick and mortar locations. In 2011, Apple revamped the store, though it stayed the same size.

The feature is deemed to be quite convenient as one needs not fiddle with clumsy cabling in order to charge a phone. When iPhone users got wind of the technology, they too, wanted a slice of the action. Now, while experts have speculated that the iPhone 7s, 7s Plus, and the tenth anniversary iPhone will have wireless charging, a CEO of a known wireless charging provider has finally confirmed the initial rumors. According to Powermat CEO Elad Dubzinski, wireless charging will be a standard feature among all iPhones released this year. The CEO shared the sentiment in a recent news release from the company. Unfortunately, the press release did not clarify whether Powermat will be providing the wireless charging solution for Apple. For now, it is still uncertain which company will provide the wireless charging solution to Apple. Earlier reports suggest that either Qi and Energous are on the list of possible suppliers. Furthermore, we also cannot confirm if there is truth in Dubzinski’s pronouncement as it did not come directly from Apple. Powermat wireless charger (via amazon.com) Nevertheless, since most market pundits have been speculating that at least one of the iPhones to be released this year will have wireless charging, perhaps that is enough. Whether or not Apple includes wireless charging to the iPhone 7s and 7s Plus, it is still too soon to tell. Besides, at the moment, Apple is still in a bit of a turmoil based on recent reports about the company. According to recent updates, the company is planning on pushing the production of the iPhone until much later due to supplier concerns. Apparently, Samsung is experiencing difficulties fulfilling Apple’s design requirements for the iPhone 8’s OLED display. Also, a number of Apple suppliers are still scrambling to meet production deadlines for the upcoming tenth anniversary iPhone. As with any information regarding the upcoming iPhone models, this too should be taken with a grain of salt. For more tech updates, be sure to check us out at TheBitbag.

It has created or helped push creation of new technologies to further its growth. Now, its efforts to become more self-reliant is starting to take shape starting with the micro-LED display. According to Business Korea, market watchers are warning companies like Samsung and LG as Apple advances on its micro-LED design efforts. As stated in the said article, Apple is now ready to mass produce the said display for use on the Apple Watch Series 3 by the end of the year. While Apple’s smartwatch market share is still not quite significant, companies like LG is said to lose more than $200 million in revenue if Apple uses the micro-LED. This is due to the fact that at the moment, the OLED displays used on the current and older generation Apple Watches are manufactured by LG. Apple Watch (via apple.com) Another company that is also under threat is Samsung. Currently, the company supplies all the OLED display for the iPhone 8. While the yield for bigger sized micro-LEDs are still low, it is only a matter of time before Apple makes the necessary manufacturing improvements. When that happens, Samsung could potentially lose billions of dollars in revenue from Apple alone. Apple began its efforts on micro-LED research back in 2015 when it acquired LuxVue. At the time, the display technology is still very new and not a lot of companies know about it. Also, during the early days of the research, most of the efforts were given to improving production yield as this type of display is quite difficult to manufacture. Nevertheless, it seems that all the hard work is finally paying off. Micro-LED, to those unaware, is the newest type of display technology in the market. It offers better image quality and clarity than a conventional OLED or LCD panel. It also boasts longer lifespan than an OLED as well as being brighter. However, due to its complexity, it is still a bit expensive to mass produce. For more tech updates, be sure to check us out at TheBitbag.

Yesterday, Ming-Chi Kuo speculated that Apple might push the production of the tenth anniversary iPhone by two months. Now, a somewhat questionable report seems to suggest that Apple might ditch the iPhone 7s and 7s Plus altogether in favor of the iPhone 8. Rumored iPhone 8 models According to a report from Chinese tech blog MicGadget, supply chain sources linked with Foxconn are saying the company has received orders from Apple for two iPhone models. What is more interesting, these orders are not for the iPhone 7 upgrade. Instead, the alleged orders are for two models of iPhone 8. For months now, market experts have been saying that Apple will not be able to release a complete range of iPhones carrying an OLED display. This is mainly due to the fact that as of now, there is a global shortage for the display and will further increase next year and the year after that. That is why it is somewhat ludicrous to think that Apple will be releasing two iPhone 8 models, both with OLED displays as the supply chain will not permit it to be. There is a chance that the website might have misunderstood that information given to it. It is possible that the orders are for both the iPhone 7s and 7s Plus instead of two iPhone 8 models. iPhone 8 concept (via idropnews.com) New iPhone 8 pricing There have been a lot of reports saying that the iPhone 8 will cost somewhere north of $1,000. This is due to the new hardware updates that Apple is putting into the phone. However, an analyst from Morgan Stanley says the phone will be somewhere around $750 when released. The reasoning behind this is that Apple will use the iPhone 8 as a leverage so people will more likely upgrade to the new phone when it comes out. Also, the firm believes that the iPhone 8 will generate more sales just like the trend Apple is having with the iPhone 7 Plus. On the other hand, analysts from Longbow Research claims that due to Apple’s ever increasing expenditure, the iPhone 8 will still have a slightly premium price. Although, the report claims, it will not go beyond the $1,000 mark like initially predicted. Instead, consumers could be looking at an iPhone 8 priced around $850. It should be noted though that this price is still higher than the Samsung Galaxy S8 which is priced at $720. iPhone 8 release date At the moment, the general consensus is that Apple might not launch the iPhone 8 in September. Instead, Apple might need a bit more time sorting out supply bottlenecks as well as manufacturing issues. Yesterday, known market analyst Ming-Chi Kuo from KGI Securities speculated that Apple might push the production of the iPhone by two months. Instead of initial reports of August or September production, it will now be done in October or November. This delay in production could potentially delay the official release of the iPhone 8 until early next year. Alleged iPhone 8 dummy by Benjamin Geskin On the other hand, Nikkei seems to think that Apple might still be able to release the said smartphone this year; with October seen as the earlier possible release date. The Nikkei somehow contradicts Kuo’s earlier prediction and builds on the report by IHS Market saying Apple will start production of the iPhone 8 in July. According to the IHS Market report, Samsung is still having issues manufacturing the displays that Apple wanted. The display maker originally planned to start production of the display in May. However, due to manufacturing difficulties, it was now pushed by two months. Once again, readers should note that these are nothing but speculations made by experts in the field. They are, in no way, accurate and should not be used as a basis of facts. However, it should also be noted that some of the speculations, especially the ones made by Kuo, are somewhat reliable if not totally correct at best. Nonetheless, these pronouncements should still be taken with a grain of salt. For more updates on the iPhone 8, be sure to check us out at TheBitbag.

Photos Videos Topics Live Cricket Score Home India Mumbai Delhi World Business Technology Sports IPL Entertainment Bollywood Hollywood Television Lifestyle Education & Careers TRENDING# Sonu Nigam Vijay Mallya TTV Dinakaran Donald Trump IPL 2017 News Business News Smartphone prices likely to go up under GST; here's why (Reuters) Shares19 DNA Web Team | Wed, 26 Apr 2017-09:44am , Mumbai , DNA webdesk The prices of your Apple iPhones and Samsung Galaxys are likely to go up once the crucial Goods and Services Tax (GST) reform comes into place as the government is mulling a proposal to levy customs duty on the import of these devices. According to a report by The Economic Times, such a levy is expected to take the prices of smartphones up by 5 - 10%. The government is hoping to roll out the GST tax reform which aims to subsume majority of the indirect taxes and replace them with a uniform tax structure in the country, by July 1, 2017. The move will give a boost to local manufacturing, encourage companies like Apple to make in India, and keep Chinese companies at bay, the report said. According to it, an inter-ministerial committee with representatives of the finance, telecom, IT, and commerce ministries have been set up to examine the issue in detail. At the same time, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley proposed the removal of countervailing duty on electronic components imported from overseas which would also help local manufacturing as input cost would come down. Several smartphone companies have set up assembling units in the country on the back of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Make in India program. According to a report by The Hindustan Times, "The value of mobile phones assembled in India has increased 373% in the last two years fro, Rs 19,000 crore in 2014-15 to over Rs 90,000 crore in 2016-17 About 40 mobile phone making plants have started since Modi announced Make in India in September 2014. These plants manufacture 20 million phones every month." Lenovo, Huawei, Motorola, all assemble their phones in the country. While the government has been urging Apple to make its smartphones in the country, the Cupertino-bsaed company is looking for several tax concessions from the government to set up a manufacturing unit here. As it stands, Union IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad is slated to meet Apple's officials to discuss the plans soon. "A lot of big mobile phone manufacturing companies have come, and if Apple comes fine, they are welcome," he said recently. He added, "They (Apple) are very keen. Its executives are going to meet me in a coule of days." Prasad said 72 global telecom firms had started production in the country over the last two years.

The iOS 10.3.1 update for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch is now available and today we want to walk you through the most important things to know as we push away from today’s release. Apple recently released two new versions of iOS 10.3. One version, iOS 10.3.2, is an unreleased bug fixer that’s in beta testing ahead of an unknown release date. The other version, iOS 10.3.1, is a small maintenance release for the iPhone, iPad and iPod touch. iOS 10.3.1 is available right now for all iPhone, iPad and iPod touch models capable of running Apple’s iOS 10 operating system. While it’s not as big as its predecessor (iOS 10.3), iOS 10.3.1 is still an important release. It comes with a security patch and some bug fixes and it could also have a dramatic effect on your device’s overall performance. With that in mind, we want to walk you through the most important things to know, right now, about iOS 10.3.1. iOS 10.3.1 Review The iOS 10.3.1 update is tiny if you’re coming directly from iOS 10.3. On the iPhone 7, you can expect a 30MB download. We were able to finish up the the download in a matter of seconds though the installation process took about 5 minutes to complete on our phone. We recommend putting aside 10 minutes or so to monitor the situation. Our installation went smoothly but there’s no telling what you might encounter. If you’re coming to iOS 10.3.1 from something older than iOS 10.3 your iOS 10.3.1 update will be much larger thanks to iOS 10.3. iOS 10.3’s features and fixes will be baked into your update so make sure you put aside 30 minutes or so to monitor the installation. In the day since its release we’ve downloaded and installed the update on five versions of the iPhone: iPhone 7, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6, iPhone 5s, and iPhone 5. If you want some quick feedback, head to those links. We’ve also installed the software on four versions of the iPad including the iPad Air, iPad mini, and iPad Pro. Right now, iOS 10.3.1 is looking good. And given what’s on board (an important fix for a potential Wi-Fi exploit), it’s definitely worth a look if you own one of these devices. If you need more feedback about iOS 10.3.1 and its changes, take a look at our reasons to, and not to, install the iOS 10.3.1 update on your device right now. iOS 10.3.1: What’s New The iOS 10.3.1 change log states the update comes with bug fixes and security patches meaning it’s a maintenance update. Don’t expect any new features on board. Apple lists the iOS 10.3.1 update as having an single security patch. The update also reportedly fixes unnamed iPhone 5 and iPhone 5c issues. That said, if you’re coming to iOS 10.3.1 from iOS 10.2.1 or something older, you’ll get a bunch of new features with iOS 10.3.1 due to iOS 10.3. If you’re unfamiliar with iOS 10.3 we recommend taking a look at our walkthrough so that you can get familiar with its features before you install iOS 10.3.1 on your device. It’s also worth noting that Apple’s Clips application is finally out on the App Store for both the iPhone and iPad. Clips is available for select devices running iOS 10.3 or iOS 10.3.1. Clips isn’t available for the iPhone 5, iPhone 5c, or iPad 4. iOS 10.3.1 Problems It’s a small update but the iOS 10.3.1 update is causing problems for many iPhone, iPad and iPod touch users. iOS 10.3.1 users are complaining about battery drain, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, various first and third-party apps, lag, random reboots, and more. We expect complaints to pickup as more people find and discover the iOS 10.3.1 update lurking in Settings or on iTunes. If you’re seeing an issue after downloading the iOS 10.3.1 update, take a look at our list of fixes for the most common iOS 10 problems. You’ll also want to take a look at our tips to improve performance. You’ll also want to report any issues you see to Apple so that its engineers can get to work on a fix for the issue. Note: You can no longer downgrade from iOS 10.3.1 in an effort to fix performance issues. Apple’s no longer signing off on iOS 10.2.1 or iOS 10.3 which means you’re stuck on iOS 10.3.1 until the company rolls out a new update. iOS 10.3.1 Jailbreak If you’re jailbroken, skip the iOS 10.3.1 update for now. Jailbreak developers haven’t released a working jailbreak tool for iOS 10.2.1 or iOS 10.3 and we’re not expecting one for iOS 10.3.1 today or in the near future. For now, you must be on iOS 10.2 or something older to jailbreak an iPhone or an iPad. Unfortunately, there’s no way to downgrade to anything older than iOS 10.2.1. For more on the iOS 10 jailbreak, see our roundup. What’s Next With the iOS 10.3.1 release out of the way, Apple’s now focused on iOS 10.3.2, another maintenance update. Apple’s iOS 10.3.2 update is currently in beta for developers and the general public. We still don’t have a release date and we might not get one ahead of time. Apple typically doesn’t confirm iOS release dates ahead of time. While you might be tempted to try the iOS 10.3.2 update out ahead of its release, note that early software can and probably will cause problems on your device. For more on the merits of the iOS 10.3.2 beta, take a look at our walkthrough. 4 Reasons Not to Install iOS 10.3.1 & 9 Reasons You Should Install iOS 10.3.1 If You Want Better Security   1 / 13 If you value your security, you'll want to seriously consider downloading the iOS 10.3.1 update on your iPhone or iPad.  iOS 10.3.1 brings a single security patch for a potential Wi-Fi exploit. But if you failed to install iOS 10.3, your iOS 10.3.1 update will bring its monster list of patches as well.  The iOS 10.3 update delivered over 60 known patches for potential exploits. That's substantial, even for a milestone upgrade. The previous version of iOS 10, iOS 10.2.1, brought 14 known patches. Among them is a patch for a Safari ransomware bug that scammers used to extort iOS users who viewed pornography on their device.  These patches enhance the security on your iPhone, iPad and iPod touch making them ideal for those of you who store sensitive files/data on your device. Most people do. If you skipped the iOS 10.2.1 update and/or the iOS 10.2 update, know that iOS 10.3.1 brings their security patches with it as well. Again, the iOS 10.2.1 update had 14 important patches on board. You can see them all right here.  If you failed to install Apple's iOS 9.3.5 update, iOS 10.3.1 will also bring the three crucial security patches it delivered last year. These patch up serious security problems that could potentially expose your calls, contacts, texts, and emails. If security is important to you, iOS 10.3.1 is probably worth a download right now.   1 / 13 5 Responses 04/05/2017 H. Mitchell Reply I would like to see a fix for the recent calls listed on mutiple devices linked to the same apple id. Apple seems to store your call history ‘somewhere’ and my recent calls are displayed on my husband’s and daughter’s device (and vice versa). Apple has no business with my call history, this is private information and should only be accessible by my service provider and myself. Call history should not be linked via an apple id. 04/10/2017 Sebastian Reply DO NOT INSTALL THIS UPDATE! I have had several problems. I gave an iPhone 6s. 2 factor authentication did not work. When I got a hold of apple support they said to turn it off and wait for the next update. Worst part, my battery gets depleted very rapidly. Within 30 minutes my fully charged phone died! 04/14/2017 Thomas Meredith Reply Ever since I have done the update. My messaging system is saying waiting on activation. I can no longer message anyone. How do I fix this? 04/19/2017 Anand Reply I am unable to do the upgrade. Whenever I try (tried 20times so far) it goes up to “Verifying updates” and thereafter I receive a message “An error occurred while installing 10.3.1” with two options “Retry” and “Remind me later” I have followed all the instructions but unable to resolve this problem 04/25/2017 K Nelson Reply This update has messed up my email. I am not getting alerts and can not send email from my iPad. The email addresses do not appear to be a available to use. I email addresses are incorrect. Now. I use email to get my work assignments and not receiving them on time makes me miss work. And I can’t send emails from my addresses.

(WJHL) – A 12-year-old Bluff City Middle School student finally received the Apple Watch promised to her for her school fundraising efforts, but only after the school first sent her home with a generic smart watch. Knowing she needed to sell 30 items to score an Apple Watch, Chloe Ketron sold $500 worth of cookie dough and pizza as part of her recent school fundraiser. “I felt excited and proud that I had sold that much,” she said. “I was really hoping to get that Apple Watch. My mom had one and I really wanted one.” Her excitement quickly turned to frustration and sadness when it came time to open her reward. “I was really upset and disappointed,” she said. “I just saw that it looked nothing like an Apple Watch. I was just sort of angry. I knew my mom would be, because we both worked really hard and put a lot into this.” She said the generic watch given to her as her reward was incompatible with her iPhone and far less expensive than the more than $250 starting price for its Apple competitor. Chloe’s grandmother Judy Ayres said the situation made her feel “angry, disillusioned and disappointed.” “Chloe worked very hard on this,” she said. “It hurts. It hurts doubly when it’s your child or grandchild.” Chloe’s family says they called the district office and the middle school with concerns, but Sullivan County Director of Schools Evelyn Rafalowski said the principal first found out about the situation Monday, after WJHL started asking questions. “(The principal) states there was an oversight and a student was given a smart watch instead of an Apple watch,” she said in an email Monday. “The vendor is taking care of it and replacing the smart watch with an Apple watch.” Rafalowski said it’s her understanding five students were impacted. “Apple watches were being delivered today to the students,” Rafalowski said Tuesday. “(The principal) has found no one who received any report that a student received the wrong watch. This was an error which if had been brought to the attention of the administration would have been taken care of at that time.” “I’m glad they’re going to change that and they’re actually going to stick to their word,” Chloe said excitedly in response to the good news Monday afternoon. The sixth grade student received her watch Tuesday afternoon and is now proudly wearing it. “I think it’s unfortunate,” her grandmother said of the situation. “I’m glad they’re going to make it right. Chloe worked very hard on this.” WJHL attempted to contact the vendor Tuesday morning and is waiting to hear back.

In other words, capitalists make profits because their costs are externalized and born by others. In the US, society and the environment have to pick up the tab produced by capitalist activity. In the past when critics raised the question about external costs, that is, costs that are external to the company although produced by the company’s activities, economists answered that it was not really a problem, because those harmed by the activity could be compensated for the damages that they suffered. This statement was intended to reinforce the claim that capitalism served the general welfare. However, the extremely primitive nature of American property rights meant that rarely would those suffering harm be compensated. The apologists for capitalism saved the system in the abstract, but not in reality. My recent article, “The Destruction of Inlet Beach,” made it clear to me that very little, if any, of the real estate development underway would be profitable if the external costs imposed on existing property holders had to be compensated. http://www.paulcraigroberts.org/2017/04/17/destruction-inlet-beach/ Consider just a few examples. When a taller house is constructed in front of one of less height, the Gulf view of the latter is preempted. The damage to the property value of the house whose view has been blocked is immense. Would the developer build such a tall structure if the disadvantaged existing property had to be compensated for the decline in its value? When a house is built that can sleep 20 or 30 people next to a family’s vacation home or residence, the noise and congestion destroys the family’s ability to enjoy their own property. If they had to be compensated for their loss, would the hotel, disquised as a “single family dwelling” have been built? Walton County, Florida, is so unconcerned about these vital issues that it has permitted construction of structures that can accommodate 30 people, but provide only three parking spaces. Where do the rental guests park? How many residents will find themselves blocked in their own driveways or with cars parked on their lawns? As real estate developers build up congestion, travel times are extended. What formerly was a 5 minute drive from Inlet Beach to Seaside along 30-A can now take 45 minutes during summer and holidays, possibly longer. Residents and visitors pay the price of the developers’ profits in lost time. The road is a two-lane road that cannot be widened. Yet Walton County’s planning department took no account of the gridlock that would emerge. As the state and federal highways serving the area were two lanes, over-development made hurricane evacuation impossible. Florida and US taxpayers had to pay for turning two lane highways into four lane highways in order to provide some semblance of hurricane evacuation. After a decade, the widening of highway 79, which runs North-South is still not completed to its connection to Interstate 10. Luckily, there have been no hurricanes. If developers had to pay these costs instead of passing them on to taxpayers, would their projects still be profitable? Now consider the external costs of offshoring the production of goods and services that US corporations, such as Apple and Nike, market to Americans. When production facilities in the US are closed and the jobs are moved to China, for example, the American workers lose their jobs, medical coverage, careers, pension provision, and often their self-respect when they are unable to find comparable employment or any employment. Some fall behind in their mortgage and car payments and lose their homes and cars. The cities, states, and federal governments lose the tax base as personal income and sales taxes decline and as depressed housing and commercial real estate prices in the abandoned communities depress property taxes. Social security and Medicare funding is harmed as payroll tax deposits fall. State and local infrastructure declines. Possibly crime rises. Safety net needs rise, but expenditures are cut as tax revenues decline. Municipal and state workers find their pensions at risk. Education suffers. All of these costs greatly exceed Apple’s and Nike’s profits from substituting cheaper foreign labor for American labor. Contradicting the neoliberal claims, Apple’s and Nike’s prices do not drop despite the collapse in labor costs that the corporations experience. A country that was intelligently governed would not permit this. As the US is so poorly governed, the executives and shareholders of global corporations are greatly enriched because they can impose the costs associated with their profits on external third parties. The unambigious fact is that US capitalism is a mechanism for looting the many for the benefit of the few. Neoliberal economics was constructed in order to support this looting. In other words, neoliberal economists are whores just like the Western print and TV media. Yet, Americans are so insouciant that you will hear those who are being looted praise the merits of “free market capitalism.” So far we have barely scratched the surface of the external costs that capitalism imposes. Now consider the pollution of the air, soil, waterways, and oceans that result from profit-making activities. Consider the radioactive wastes pouring out of Fukushima since March 2011 into the Pacific Ocean. Consider the dead zones in the Gulf of Mexico from agricultural chemical fertilizer run-off. Consider the destruction of the Apalachicola, Florida, oyster beds from the restricted river water that feeds the bay due to overdevelopment upstream. Examples such as these are endless. The corporations responsible for this destruction bear none of the costs. If it turns out that global warming and ocean acidification are consequences of capitalism’s carbon-based energy system, the entire world could end up dead from the external costs of capitalism. Free market advocates love to ridicule economic planning, and Alan Greenspan and Larry Summers actually said that “markets are self-regulating.” There is no sign anywhere of this self-regulation. Instead, there are external costs piled upon external costs. The absence of planning is why over-development has made 30-A dysfunctional, and it is why over-development has made metropolitan areas, such as Atlanta, Georgia, dysfunctional. Planning does not mean the replacement of markets. It means the provision of rules that produce rational results instead of shifting costs of development onto third parties. If capitalism had to cover the cost of its activities, how many of the activities would pay? As capitalists do not have to cover their external costs, what limits the costs? Once the external costs exceed the biosphere’s ability to process the waste products associated with external costs, life ends. We cannot survive an unregulated capitalism with a system of primitive property rights. Ecological economists such as Herman Daly understand this, but neoliberal economists are apologists for capitalist looting. In days gone by when mankind’s footprint on the planet was light, what Daly calls an “empty world,” productive activities did not produce more wastes than the planet could cleanse. But the heavy foot of our time, what Daly calls a “full world,” requires extensive regulation. The Trump administration’s program of rolling back environmental protection, for example, will multiply external costs. To claim that this will increase economic growth is idiotic. As Daly (and Michael Hudson) emphasize, the measure known as Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is so flawed that we do not know whether the increased output costs more to produce than it is worth. GDP is really a measure of what has been looted without reference to the cost of the looting. Environmental deregulation means that capitalists can treat the environment as a garbage dump. The planet can become so toxic that it cannot recover. In the United States and generally across the Western world, property rights exist only in a narrow, truncated form. A developer can steal your view forever and your solitude for the period his construction requires. If the Japanese can have property rights in views, in quiet which requires noise abatement, and in sun fall on their property, why can’t Americans? After all, we are alleged to be the “exceptional people.” But in actual fact, Americans are the least exceptional people in human history. Americans have no rights at all. We hapless insignificant beings have to accept whatever capitalists and their puppet government impose on us. And we are so stupid we call it “Freedom and Democracy America.” The original source of this article is Paul Craig Roberts Copyright © Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, Paul Craig Roberts, 2017 Comment on Global Research Articles on our Facebook page Become a Member of Global Research Articles by: Dr. Paul Craig Roberts http://paulcraigroberts.org About the author:Paul Craig Roberts, former Assistant Secretary of the US Treasury and Associate Editor of the Wall Street Journal, has held numerous university appointments.

By Corazon Victorino On 04/25/17 AT 11:04 PM Close A new report is shedding light on what Apple is planning for its next Apple Watch smartwatch. And it appears the Cupertino giant’s next move is what South Korea companies Samsung and LG fear the most. Tim Cook’s company is said to be eyeing a new technology for the Apple Watch 3 and its iPhones that will surely be a game changer for the two manufacturers.  A recent Business Korea report stated industry watchers are predicting that there will be drastic changes to Apple’s relationship with the South Korean component industry starting this year. This is because Apple is now planning to use the new power-efficient display technology called micro-LED for its Apple Watch Series 3. The same display technology is expected to be used in making the iPhones that would come after this year’s iPhone 8.  The micro-LED technology is the next-generation display after the currently in-demand organic light-emitting diode (OLED). The former is thinner and lighter and measures only five to 10 micrometers, and these are the reasons why Apple wants to use the technology for its next smartwatch. In February, the Cupertino giant was granted a patent for sensing infrared diodes on the surface of a display. Apple is said to be working with LuxVue, which it acquired last year, in making this happen with micro-LED.  The inclusion of sensing infrared diodes into a micro-LED panel would mean that the screen itself would be capable of reading fingerprints. Thus, it is possible for the next Apple Watch to have Touch ID functionality on its display. The same technology is then expected to be present in the iPhones following this year’s iPhone 8, which is speculated to have a similar technology or one that involves placing an optical sensor below a glass surface.  READ: Apple reportedly not releasing iPhone 7s, 7s Plus this year According to AppleInsider, the use of micro-LED in the Apple Watch 3 would actually be the stepping stone for Apple to move away from OLED. If micro-LED is successfully incorporated into the upcoming smartwatch, Apple could move forward with producing larger micro-LED panels that would be suitable for its future iPhones. Hence, Samsung’s involvement in creating screens for this year’s iPhone would only be temporary.  While the innovative technology would surely be groundbreaking, Samsung and LG are threatened for different reasons. Apparently, Apple’s micro-LED displays would be sourced from Taiwan-based plant Taoyuan. And though Apple is rumored to be ordering only a small quantity of micro-LED panels later this year, the problem would become apparent once the tech giant decides to solely use micro-LED for its upcoming smartwatches and smartphones. Apple’s possible move away from OLED would greatly affect Samsung and LG. Apple is currently ordering its OLED panels for its Apple Watch devices from LG Display. Should Tim Cook’s company move forward with micro-LED, industry sources are anticipating LG to lose an estimated $201.35 million. On the other hand, Samsung Display is the supplier of OLEDs for the iPhone 8, so this would also lead to big losses for the Galaxy S8 maker.  Apart from OLED displays, Samsung and LG are also fearing for when Apple starts sourcing other components like RAM and cameras from other companies. There is word that Apple is seeking to acquire Toshiba’s memory business, and this could mean the end of the road for Samsung’s memory-focused relationship with Apple. For almost two decades, the Cupertino giant has been one of the largest RAM customers of Samsung.  Meanwhile, AppAdvice has said that the next-generation Apple Watch could also come equipped with cellular connectivity. Though no design changes are being anticipated, Apple is said to be focused on creating a wearable with better battery life and overall performance than its predecessors. There is no information on the release date of the Apple Watch Series 3 yet, but several sources are saying that consumers should expect it to arrive in the third quarter of this year. Apple Watch is said to be using an advanced display technology for its next Apple Watch.

The hour-long compendium — which will initially be an Apple Music exclusive — was intended as a surprise for fans, but also somewhat mandated as one, since Paisley didn’t get around to filming 15 of the 16 concept videos until a month ago (the exception being “Today,” which came out in 2016). Indeed, one of his new song titles, “Let’s Go to Bed Early,” may have fresh meaning for Paisley after the series of punishing all-nighters he pulled as co-director to get the whole collection to Apple on time. Then again, Paisley has long looked like he was having a little more fun making music videos than just about any of his country music contemporaries. He didn’t just nick some of Mark Knopfler’s fluid picking style for his virtuosic own; as a child of the 1980s, he also has fond memories of when “we all started making little movies for singles, and with MTV, it was like, ‘We could really get their attention if Dire Straits is a cartoon.’” So his doing it in bulk isn’t necessarily a complete shock. Paisley spoke with Variety about balancing comedy and tears in the new collections, pulling in Mick Jagger and John Fogerty for guest appearances, and the rush to the finish line for what surely won’t be the last everything-at-once video album the genre produces. Seeing as very few visual collections — where every song on an album has an accompanying conceptual video — exist, were you inspired by Beyoncé’s video album?  I didn’t see all of “Lemonade,” but I loved what I saw. Obviously my take on this is a completely different thing. On the songs that lend themselves to comedy, that’s what I’m doing, and the same with the more poignant songs, because the first half of this record is really a lot more upbeat than the second half. You know me. I live in the extremes. When did you decide to do this? It wasn’t until the “Today” video [for the album’s first single, released late last year] that I got the idea to do this visual album. I saw the way that just blew up and was really connecting. So I went to the label and half-jokingly said, “I can do this with every song on this record. They’re all very visual.” It was [Sony Music Nashville’s executive VP of marketing & new business] John Zarling’s first day when I suggested that, and John, who moved over in January from Big Machine, said, “Seriously?” And the rest of the label people, I honestly know they were saying, “Yeah, right. They’re never gonna make it.” And then Apple Music said, “Listen, we feel like this would be perfect for what we’re doing with our platform.” And I said, “Well, all right, I’ll get it to you.” And we went guerilla-style, everywhere we could do this. And  the rest of the videos, besides “Today,” were done just in the last month or so? I feel like a deadline that’s that imminent makes you go with your best instincts right off the bat, as opposed to you have six months to sit around and tweak something. “Heaven South” ended up being the last video shot, Saturday before last. Which is funny, because we were going to do that first, just because it’s the first track on the album, and then it rained cats and dogs in Franklin (the small-town square of which is the setting for a massive crowd scene) — that’s Nashville, this time of year — so we had to push it two weeks. This has been the craziest few weeks of my life in many ways. We turned my studio into an edit bay. On the heels of finishing this video, which was all-nighters, one after another, I went straight from that to the “Good Morning America circuit,” which is all 4 a.m. call times. I’m feeling a little out of whack, but good. Where Beyoncé was kind of aiming at telling a single story, you’re telling 16 stories. I hope that “One Beer Can” cracks you up, and I hope to tug on the emotions with the one-two punch of “Love and War,” with me and John Fogerty on the deck of an aircraft carrier, which fades into “Today,” as the soldiers come home. I hope that there’s not a dry eye watching that… We had sort of one-line log lines for each of these. With “Heaven South,” it was essentially “Truck through Franklin, a la (the Kentucky Headhunters’ ‘80s video) ‘Keep Your Hands to Yourself’.” And for “Last Time for Everything,” it was “Stranger Things and Knight Rider.” Next thing you know, David Hasselhoff found out I was using the Knight Rider car and said. “I’m around if you want me in it.” I said, well, yeah, what time, where? You say where and when, we’re doing it. “Go to Bed Early” was “pop-up concert in a Sleep Number store,” which was more fun than you can imagine, and also terrifying for me. We had me in an anti-gravity chamber for “Contact High.” In “One Beer Can,” that’s my parents’ house. We cast 30 Belmont students [for a raucous high school party scene]. I never did that to my mother — I never threw that party — so it serves her right that finally at my age I’m trashing her house. With a donkey. The video for “Go to Bed Early,” where you walk through a mall and end up playing a concert in a Sleep Number store was one way of solving the problem of how you were going to do a video about sleeping with someone. It looks like the reactions really are that spontaneous. I haven’t been in a mall in a while. I remember calling my manager eight or 10 years ago saying “Well, you’ve done a good job,” because I had gone in the Cool Springs Mall, where we filmed this, incognito, and I remember getting on the escalator and realizing that people were looking out of stores at me all the way down. You’re a sitting duck in a mall if you’re a celebrity. It’s like that scene from ‘Guarding Tess,’ I think it is, where Shirley MacLaine goes to the mall just to feel good about her celebrity. Word spreads in this fishbowl. I said, “I think what’s really funny is, this is a really sexy song. But what if there’s just a banner that says ‘Free live music, 5 p.m.,’ in the Sleep Number store, and then I just walk in.” We ended up filming that on Good Friday, so it was packed. All that’s real. We didn’t really re-do it. None of us noticed any of the reactions in the moment. Like, I didn’t notice the way the girls reacted when I took their waffle fries. I might as well have been the Easter bunny. This came together late enough that it’s probably not easy to reconvene all your guest stars. You must’ve been glad you had some in-studio footage of Mick Jagger recording your duet of “Drive of Shame,” which has already been released as a single in the U.K. I’m really thankful that he’s willing to allow that (footage). When you’re with somebody as iconic as Mick Jagger or John Fogerty, I’m really aware that in asking these guys to collaborate with me, I don’t want to add a footnote to their career that’s like: “Shouldn’t’ have done that.” It’s important to make sure that they’re well represented. What’s amazing with the way that we edited “Drive of Shame,” all you see from Mick for about the first half of the song is an elbow, but you know it’s him, don’t you? The same with Fogerty. [In “Love and War,” a song about veterans being forgotten], it’s like you’ve probably been thinking, “You make a good point,” but the minute you hear Fogerty’s voice, it’s like, “Now we’re gonna really take this serious, I guess, because he’s talking now, and he knows what he’s talking about.” Your voices work as well together as one could hope on the Jagger duet. You never really know what the blend is going to be until you hear it. The trick with Mick and with John is [to tell them], “Listen, don’t come [toward] me — don’t try to be country-er than you are. You have influenced country music to a degree you don’t realize, maybe.” There’s so much of our airwaves that are those guys. So, “All you gotta be is yourself. You fit. You belong. We’ve already come to you.” Not only that, but I’ve been ripping off the Rolling Stones since I was 12, so it’s like, all I had to do was not disguise it. Was it tough to get Fogerty to turn up to shoot alongside a military ship in San Diego on the spur of the moment? We’re really close. This is a man who practices guitar four hours a day, still. He’s committed to learning new things. He’s bought some gear that’s stuff that I use and vice versa; I’ve bought some stuff that he uses. There’s a mutual love there. The other thing with John is, he believes in this message. What was so heady was, when we sat down to write, he said, “This is the first time I’ve ever co-written.” I said, what? He said, “Yeah, sometimes other people were part of the song by the end of it, but as far as co-writing, I don’t do this.” I said, “You’re gonna love this, because it’s a lot less lonely and only one of us has to come up with a given line.” I told him the idea (about military veterans) and said, “I know this may not be a well you want to go back to right now.” He said, “No, I want to say this, this is a point I want to make, I’m sick and tired of what’s going on, and I agree.” He was all in, so it really was easy to say, John, I’ve got a video idea for this, what do you think? Absolutely. The same with this past Sunday night [where Fogerty showed up for a lengthy jam with Paisley at the famous Tootsie’s nightclub in Nashville]. I said we were doing an album launch thing, and did he want to come in? He said, “I’ve always wanted to take over a bar in Nashville and just jam. Do you want to do that?” This was all him. So in that sense, it’s been easy. He’s got a lot of energy for… uh… 50 years old or whatever he is. [Laughs.] As far as release patterns nowadays, everybody’s experimenting. Do you give people one song at a time, or everything at once? And if it’s everything at once, do you prepare them for it or surprise them? With this project, it’s a traditional album setup, but you’re also surprising people with the video album by, I don’t want to say dumping… [Laughs.] We’re squatting. Yeah. Is there some sweet spot in getting the public’s attention where you do things traditionally but also throw an element of surprise into it? Surprise is important. I think that’s the essence of entertainment, really. In this case, it’s also because it was a last-minute sort of edit.  We didn’t have the luxury of knowing we were gonna do this six months ago, video-wise. I wasn’t even sure which exact songs were going on here six months ago. “Meaning Again” [the album closer] wasn’t written until February, and shoot, “Last Time for Everything” [the just-released second single off the album] wasn’t written until January or February. So I was still looking for the missing pieces, and as soon as I had them, then this came about. I knew I wanted to do something like this, but I didn’t know if we had the time. Now it’s like, well, how do you best present this to people? What’s nice about this is there aren’t really rules. We’re all working in a broken industry right now. We’re working in an industry where people still love music, they still want music, but they don’t seem to want it the way we’re giving it to them. And so it’s a fun time to try things. I mean, I kind of like the anarchy of that. I sort of like the fact that we don’t have a lot to lose, in some ways. Getting it wrong just sort of means status quo. Getting it right means we learn something, and we might have delivered people something they really wanted. Filed Under: Apple Music Beyonce Brad Paisley Want to read more articles like this one?

Apple has just unveiled its latest store in Dubai with a 186-foot curved glass storefront and balcony overlooking Burj Khalifa and the Dubai Fountain. Like its other stores, Apple Dubai Mall is also designed to be an “open and transparent” community space that blurs barriers inside and out. Taking Dubai’s heat into consideration Foster + Partners have designed eighteen 37.5-foot-high motorised “Solar Wings” that respond to the climate. So, when the temperature is at its hottest they will cool the store, and open up for people to come into the public terrace in the evenings. Inspired by the traditional Arabic Mashrabiya, each of these solar wings are locally fabricated from 340 carbon fibre reinforced polymer rods, and at 180 feet wide, the 18 panels make up one of the world’s largest kinetic art installations. “We view our stores as a modern-day town square, where visitors come to shop, be inspired, learn or connect with others in their community,” said Angela Ahrendts, Apple’s senior vice president of Retail, adding that there was no better place to do this than overlooking Dubai’s epicenter, where the Dubai Fountain, Burj Khalifa and Dubai Mall meet. We are so honoured to have a home at one of the world’s most incredible and dynamic intersections.” Apple already has two stores in the United Arab Emirates which have welcomed more than 4 million visitors since opening 18 months ago. Apple hopes it will reach even more global visitors at the Dubai Mall, Emaar’s flagship mega-project with over 80 million visitors for the past three consecutive years. The company’s new “Today at Apple” concept will launch at this venue and in all 495 Apple Stores next month with new sessions across photo and video, music, coding, art and design, and more, led by highly-trained team members. On opening day there will be Live Art with Myneandyours, and Artist Duos with musician Hamdan Al Abri and artist Sultan Al Ramahi. The store has 148 employees who speak 45 languages.

Local Real Estate Subscribe Now THOSE frustrating phone calls from tech-challenged relatives could be a thing of the past with Apple unveiling a new program to help people understand how to use their gadgets. While the Apple store has long had introductory courses for those new to Apple gadgets, the Cupertino-based tech giant today has announced a new global plan to turn the nearly 500 Apple stores to turn them into tech education centres. The new program, called Today at Apple, can be traced back to the redesign of the flagship San Francisco store last year, decreasing the shelves that display products on sale to make room for a "town square", which displays artwork and hosts educational talks, as the centre of the store. The free programs are pitched at a variety of skill levels, and range from the basics of which button to hit to how to brand yourself on social media with the artwork you create. An example is photography, using the iPhone that has become the world's most popular camera. iPhone 7 Plus put to test: A video and photo montage created using an iPhone 7 Plus featuring the Sydney Harbour, Sydney Opera House and the Qantas historical aviation collection in Sydney. In the changes to the Apple stores outline by Apple's senior vice president of retail Angela Ahrendts, which begin rolling out next month, people will still take their broken gadgets to the Genius Bar to get fixed but they will now attend sessions on how to use their devices by a mix of professionals and what Apple is calling its "Creative Pros".

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile A Prominent Wireless Charging Tech Company CEO Calls Wireless Charging a “Standard Feature in the Next iPhone” By Rafia Shaikh Apr 25, 2017 10Shares Share Tweet Submit Celebrating the tenth anniversary of the iPhone lineup, this year’s rumored iPhone 8 is expected to bring a number of new features and design changes. Major improvements include OLED display and wireless charging. Several rumors and reports had previously indicated that Cupertino tech giant is finally ready to bring better screen technology along with wireless charging to catch up with its Android competition. Now, the CEO of a premier wireless technology company appears to believe the same. iPhone 8 wireless technology – a done deal? iPhone 8 wireless charging feature has been mentioned in more than a few rumors and analyst reports. Back in February, Apple officially confirmed joining the Wireless Power Consortium further fueling these expectations. Now, the CEO of a wireless charging technology company has said he considers iPhone 8 wireless charging a “standard feature in the next iPhone,” hinting that he is certain that it will definitely happen. Related iPhone 8 Suffering From Wireless Charging Overheat And Low PCB Yields; Separate Reports Claim Only Two iPhones Incoming This Year In an unrelated announcement press release, Powermat CEO Elad Dubzinski said (via 9to5mac): Advertisement “With the recent announcement by Apple that wireless charging will become a standard feature in the next iPhone, we are finally at the threshold of mainstream adoption,” said Mr. Dubzinski. “Dan Stone has a proven track record of success and is uniquely qualified to help guide Powermat to the next level of service delivery. Under his guidance, CompuCom has enjoyed a reputation for delivering unparalleled IT support for enterprise clients and their end users. We look forward to benefitting from his experience and guidance.” Apple hasn’t itself made any announcement claiming that wireless charging will become a standard feature. But, Dubzinski could be referring to the company’s joining the WPC. “Apple is an active member of many standards development organizations, as both a leader and contributor,” Apple has said following its joining of the Consortium. “Apple is joining the Wireless Power Consortium to be able to participate and contribute ideas to the open, collaborative development of future wireless charging standards.” Related $24,000 Worth Of Apple Products Stolen From The Apple Store Following Apple’s announcement, Powermat had said that the company “would be ready to support iPhones with whatever wireless charging protocol Apple employs,” hinting that it doesn’t really know how Apple will approach wireless charging. While probably nothing more than an expectation based on insider and analyst reports, Powermat CEO’s statement further adds to several previous reports, including those from the KGI Securities and analyst Christopher Roland, that we will soon be seeing iPhones supporting wireless charging.
