As noted by The Salt Lake Tribune and Desert News Cook continued to defend Apple’s refusal to implement a “backdoor” to circumvent its security measures. Cook also noted of Steve Jobs’ affect on Apple today… Cook opened his time on stage by speaking highly of Utah’s thriving development community, noting that there are more than 50,000 registered iOS developers living in the state. “There’s no place in the world I’d rather be,” he said. Regarding Jobs, Cook took a second during his Q&A with Senator Orrin Hatch to note that Jobs’ culture of creating products that “enrich people’s lives” is something that will never leave Apple. “His spirit will always be the DNA of the company,” Cook said. “Lots of things will change, but that will never change.” “It’s important because I want his legacy to be with Apple forever,” Cook said. “Not for Apple to be constrained by it  but we’re very much married to his vision of making the best products that enrich people’s lives. That doesn’t change.” The majority of Cook’s time on stage, however, was spent discussing the growing need for strong encryption. As he has done in the past, Cook said that Apple very strongly believes that encryption is the key to protect users in terms of privacy and from cyber attacks. Referencing Apple’s intense battle with the government over unlocking the San Bernardino iPhone, Cook reiterated that what Apple was asked to create is something that “should never be created.” “We throw all of ourselves into this and are very much standing on principle in this. We believe the only way to protect both your privacy and safety from a cyber attack is to encrypt. Encryption is inherently great. And we would not be a safe society without it.” Cook noted that encryption is “one of the biggest issues” Apple is currently facing. “We feel that we have a responsibility to protect our customers,” he said. In a time when high-profile privacy breaches are becoming more common, such as with the current election cycle, Cook stated that current methods for encoding data are sophisticated enough to remain untracked in the near future. Finally, Cook also noted of Apple’s growing interest in augmented reality, as well as how important digital photography is becoming at helping people preserve memories. “I think there’s two kind of different questions there. It will be enabled in the operating systems first, because it’s a precursor for that to happen for there to be mass adoption of it. I’d look for that to happen in the not-too-distant future. In terms of it becoming a mass adoption [phenomenon], so that, say, everyone in here would have an AR experience, the reality to do that, it has to be something that everyone in here views to be an ‘acceptable thing.'” “And nobody in here, few people in here, think it’s acceptable to be tethered to a computer walking in here and sitting down, few people are going to view that it’s acceptable to be enclosed in something, because we’re all social people at heart. Even introverts are social people, we like people and we want to interact. It has to be that it’s likely that AR, of the two, is the one the largest number of people will engage with. “I do think that a significant portion of the population of developed countries, and eventually all countries, will have AR experiences every day, almost like eating three meals a day, it will become that much a part of you, a lot of us live on our smartphones, the iPhone, I hope, is very important for everyone, so AR will become really big. VR I think is not going to be that big, compared to AR. I’m not saying it’s not important, it is important. “I’m excited about VR from an education point of view, I think it can be really big for education, I think it can be very big for games. But I can’t imagine everyone in here getting in an enclosed VR experience while you’re sitting in here with me. But I could imagine everyone in here in an AR experience right now, if the technology was there, which it’s not today. How long will it take? “AR is going to take a while, because there are some really hard technology challenges there. But it will happen, it will happen in a big way, and we will wonder when it does, how we ever lived without it. Like we wonder how we lived without our phone today.” Ultimately, Cook reiterated that Apple is continually working on “finding new ways of making people safer.” Video of Cook’s Q&A at Utah Tech Tour can be seen below: Top image via Desert News Guides Tim Cook The CEO of Apple View THe Guide blog comments powered by Disqus Submit a Tip cancel Submitting a tip constitutes permission to publish and syndicate.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it October 2 Responses from consumer products companies and battery-makers in response to questions about using graphite in their batteries from polluting plants: Amazon.com: “We are committed to ensuring the highest standards in all areas of production and manufacturing. We work closely with our suppliers to ensure they meet our standards, and conduct a number of audits every year to ensure our manufacturing partners are in compliance with our policies.” Apple: An Apple spokesman said that for its current products, the company has switched to synthetic graphite, which is not mined. The company declined to say when it made this change to rely exclusively on synthetic graphite. General Motors: “GM is committed to transforming the industry by reducing the environmental impact of our vehicles and manufacturing them in the most sustainable manner possible. This transformation includes our global suppliers. We have a process in place to identify sustainability risks in the supply chain which includes economic, environmental and social/governance risks. We require our suppliers to comply with local and regional environmental laws and regulations and to be fair, humane and lawful employers, and to enforce similar requirements from their sub-suppliers.” LG Chem: “LG Chem is fully aware [that] preemptively corresponding to safety and environment risk is the key element of sustainability. Therefore, LG Chem have established safety and environment policy to share with all employees and out to public. . . . In 2014, LG Chem visited the [graphite] supplier [BTR] in order to inspect the plant management system and a third-party management system, but no specific problems were found. LG Chem shall continuously keep monitoring it.” LG: “LG Chem has responded to your questions directly.” Panasonic: “Panasonic has investigated the environmental situation at the mine you cited. We found that the operators received an administrative directive from the local authorities in 2014 and have since that time implemented the necessary environmental countermeasures. Additionally, we learned that the local authorities have approved and confirmed the mine’s completion of those countermeasures.” Samsung Electronics: “Samsung Electronics is keen to ensure that the subcontractors of its suppliers are committed to comply with our high-level standards and thus mandate all its registered suppliers to complete an annual self-assessment, during which they are required to submit information about the environment, social and health compliance status of their suppliers. “Samsung is well aware of the corporate world’s responsibilities and roles with problems caused by the mining of minerals. Given the nature of this issue, joint efforts among governments, [nongovernmental organizations] and corporations are urgently needed. As a result, we have pledged to redouble our efforts and find ways to resolve these challenges by listening to greater numbers of stakeholders and actively participating in joint initiatives.” Samsung SDI (battery maker): “We are currently investigating on your concerns, so at this time we do not have detailed information. Should the investigation raise any red flag, we will be happy to give you an update. Please positively understand it.” TDK/Amperex Technology Ltd. (ATL): In response to a request for information about the company’s role in the battery supply chain, a spokeswoman for a TDK subsidiary wrote that “TDK and ATL have replied that they would not take this interview as some information may not be disclosed to the publics.” Toyota: “Toyota does not purchase cobalt and graphite directly; rather, we purchase components that contain these materials from suppliers. However, we make efforts to minimize the impact of our procurement activities on local communities, and we will ask our suppliers to take actions to avoid using certain materials if there is a concern about the source. “Consistent with our Guiding Principles, we engage suppliers throughout our worldwide operations to help ensure they are aware of and abide by our standards, as well as to assess potential issues. As part of these efforts, we may ask a supplier to make improvements, and we follow up on these improvement activities when necessary.” Responses from graphite and graphite anode producers in response to complaints of pollution: BTR: “All subsidiary companies under BTR is environmental friendly and is qualified and approved from the government, and the production is strictly operated according to the related law and regulation.” Aoyu: A person at Aoyu who answered the phone and identified himself as sales and marketing manager said: “The only thing is the dust, which is black in appearance, so people might think that there is pollution. But in reality, there is no pollution. It’s superficial because it’s carbon. Carbon isn’t harmful — it’s different from coal and cement, because when people breathe coal and cement particles it can cause disease. That doesn’t happen with carbon.” Haida: Manager Chu Helei sent a garbled message accusing The Washington Post of “espionage.” Hensen: Deputy General Manager Mo Haibo answered some questions about the company via email but did not respond to questions regarding pollution. business economy true Please provide a valid email address.

Instead the app has transformed into an interactive playground where users can send stickers, drawings, handwriting, play games, and more. Now one of the new features of Messages is the ability to add stickers to your messages. This has resulted in a rather fun and interesting app called “Phoneys”, which basically lets you overlay chat bubbles on your messages to make it look like the other person sent you a message, like in the screenshot above. However Apple isn’t too pleased with the app and has since asked its developer to adhere to its guidelines, or they’ll have to remove it. According to its developer Adam Howell, he received a call from Apple after the sticker pack shot to the #1 spot in the iMessage App Store. “Apple’s lawyers weren’t happy that Phoneys got through the review process. The stickers couldn’t be blue or green, they couldn’t use San Francisco as the typeface, and the app could no longer be marketed as a ‘prank’ app, because Apple doesn’t approve prank apps.” Howell reiterates a couple of times that he never called it a prank app, although he does see how it could be seen that way. He also notes that Apple told him that they would not remove the app, and instead gave him a week to change it so that it would follow their guidelines. Howell appears to be undecided as to whether or not he will make changes to his app, but for now it looks like it’s still available for purchase for $0.99, so if you want you should hurry and get it before it is gone.

Thanks to Steve Jobs, co-founder of Apple Inc., students have this technology. Unfortunately, Jobs, 56, passed away Wednesday, Oct. 5, due to a rare form of pancreatic cancer. Anything with an “i” before it is Jobs’ doing. Jobs, who dropped out of college after only attending Reed College for six months, started Apple Inc. at an early age and created a totally new culture of technology, including the Mac, iPod, iTunes, iPhone, iTouch, iPad and iPhone. Students and faculty rely heavily on Apple products, especially Macs, for their majors and classes. Associate professor of art Theresa Harris, who teaches graphic design and typography, has been using Macs for a long time and believes they are necessary for her classes. “[Apple] is the industry’s standard,” Harris said. “It’s what over 95 percent of the graphic design industry and design field use as well as fields in video and animation. Everybody is an Apple fan. Jobs’ influence on the graphic design industry cannot be understated. He totally revolutionized the field.” Graphic design major Khalid Spry agrees with Harris when it comes to using Macs for his major. “His products will help me launch my business designing clothing.” As Harris said before, Apple products have been being used for the field of video and animation as well. Jobs was also the owner of the animated film company Pixar. Theatre & Cinema major Carlos Gomez works with Macs all the time for his major and says it’s essential that students can be able to use the technology at Western. “At Western, the Mac labs have been absolutely necessary for our cinema and digital animations majors, which seem to be expanding with the current entertainment industry,” he said. “Mac or PC?” has been a very popular question that has been asked in past years, and Gomez explains why Macs works better for his major. “Apple has the rights to use more powerful software in their computers,” Gomez said. “Apple has the rights to the big filmmaking software, like Final Cut Pro. Although software, like Adobe’s Premiere, is both for a PC and Mac, it was first created for Mac, so the brand trust is with Apple.” Macs have helped a lot of other majors, like journalism for laying out newspaper and yearbook pages, but Apple technology has also changed this generation as a whole. “[Jobs] connects with this generation in terms of music and the visuals and animation in the movies,” Harris said. “It’s a beautiful thing: The way he has this marriage between design and technology, and it just comes together in a wonderful package that is efficient and functions well. He made using technology an experience and made us all want to be a part of that culture.” Even though Jobs has passed away, Spry believes he will not be forgotten. “Steve Jobs will live on as long as you see the Apple mark.” This entry was posted in Features, Lifestyles and tagged death, Ipad, iPod, Legacy, Steve Jobs.

Features Reviews Phones Android iPhone Windows Phone Apps Computers Laptops Lenovo Tablets Windows Tutorials Events More Audio Crowfunding Design/Concepts Gadgets Gaming General Photo/Video Web Ubergizmo in French Ubergizmo in German Ubergizmo in Italian Ubergizmo in Spanish iPhone 7 VS All Other iPhones In A Speed Test By Tyler Lee on 10/02/2016 15:15 PST Like tech videos? Subscribe to Ubergizmo on Youtube So we know that the iPhone 7 is fast. This has been proven in benchmarks and in videos where it is put up against other phones. Obviously this has to be the case otherwise Apple is most definitely doing something wrong, right? That being said, the folks at EverythingApplePro have put together a video in which they test the iPhone 7’s speed against every iPhone ever built. Yup, this means that the iPhone 7 will go head to head iPhones like the iPhone 3G, the iPhone 3GS, and the iPhone 4 (which some still argue is one of the best designs for Apple’s iPhones) just to name a few. Now the results are going to be obvious because like we said, if the newer iPhones prove to be slower than its predecessors, Apple must have dropped the ball somewhere, although thankfully that doesn’t appear to be the case. If anything we guess it is a good example of how far along our phones have come in terms of technology, such as its display, speed, design, and more. Apple has made some pretty huge leaps with the iPhone 7 & 7 Plus. For example the A10 Fusion chipset is a quad-core chipset, whereas in the past few generations Apple has gone with a dual-core setup. This has been criticized by fans and competitors who have been using quad-core setups for a while, not to mention some have even gone with octa-core setups in some cases. The iPhone 7 Plus is also given a bump in RAM to 3GB. Granted this is still below the 4GB which seems to be standard for Android devices these days, but it is still an improvement for users of Apple products. Filed in Apple >Cellphones.

But in Brooklyn Beckham's case, it seems it can have its downsides after the teen reportedly tried and failed to buy booze while watching Chance The Rapper at the Apple Music Festival in London on Friday. According to The Sun on Sunday, the 17-year-old son of David and Victoria approached the upstairs bar of Camden's Roundhouse for a drink when the venue's staff recognised him and immediately knew he was underage. Scroll down for video Awkward: Brooklyn Beckham, 17, reportedly attempted and failed to buy booze while watching Chance The Rapper at the Apple Music Festival in London on Friday The paper reports that the server told the famous teen: 'I know you, you're Brooklyn Beckham'. Putting his tail between his legs, Brooklyn was left mortified by the exchange and allegedly stuck to soft drinks for the rest of the night.

Oops: Brooklyn was reportedly recognised as the eldest offspring of David and Victoria Beckham - who are famous for their footballing and singing talents Oh no! According to The Sun on Sunday, the son of David and Victoria approached the upstairs bar of Camden's Roundhouse for a drink when the venue's staff recognised him and immediately knew he was underage (pictured in April 2016) The eldest son of former footballer David and fashion designer Victoria is known for his clean cut image and a being a role model to his younger siblings - Romeo, 14, Cruz, 11 and Harper, 5. Brooklyn, who recently split from actress girlfriend Chloe Moretz, 19, is a fitness fanatic and keeps his social media followers up-to-date with his tedious gym regime. Back in London following his summer break in LA, the fashionable teen has been spotted hanging out with pal Rocco Ritchie - son of Madonna and Guy Ritchie. The alleged incident comes after Brooklyn signed a deal with Spanish fashion brand Pull & Bear earlier this month - making a model-worthy appearance at the company's photocall in Spain, last week. Hanging out: Brooklyn went to the event to see Chance The Rapper The gig comes just weeks after signing a contract to appear in an advert for mobile phone company Huawei worth £100,000.  A source previously told The Sun: 'Huawei went for Brooklyn because he's young, well-presented and seen as a good role model for kids his age. 'He's got millions of social media followers and this is a good way to engage a load of youngsters.'

Follow TechnoBuffalo Truly wireless earbuds are no longer the stuff of science fiction. Apple, Samsung and countless smaller companies are selling them now (or soon, in Apple’s case), but there’s still plenty of room left to improve. With that in mind here are two fresh takes on the technology currently making the rounds on Kickstarter. Phantom Air bills itself as the world’s first tunable wireless earbuds, while Ear-On boasts a compact water-resistant design that you can wear while swimming. One of the biggest complaints most people have when it comes to wireless earbuds, and Bluetooth in general, is that audio quality takes a hit. Phantom Air hopes to solve that issue by using high-end materials and components, including 7mm titanium dynamic drivers and five swappable tuning filters to choose based on your music preferences. Just change them as needed if you’re in the mood for extra bass or want a more neutral sound. The exterior is a piece of machined aluminum that’s treated with splash-proof coating and available in black, red, orange or gunmetal gray. There’s also a built-in microphone for making calls and a single physical button with multiple functions. Press it once to pause your music or answer a call. You can also use the button to skip between tracks and hold it down to turn the earbuds on. Each Phantom Air earbud offers three hours of battery life. There’s also a battery case that promises 10 extra charges on the go. The case looks like it’s too bulky to fit comfortably in your pocket, but it probably won’t take up much space in a bag. You can pre-order Phantom Air for $117 and it should arrive by January. The company, which has an established track record for high-end audio technology, says it’s finished with development and just needs money to start mass production. So hopefully there won’t be any delays. Ear-On takes a very different approach to wireless earbud design. These earbuds look absolutely tiny, and the charging case that comes with them slides into your pocket like a pen. Despite their small size the company still packed lots of features inside, offering fitness tracking, a waterproof design and more. I reached out to Ear-On’s creator directly to ask how swimming with the earbuds would work. He confirmed that they’re water-resistant, but noted that they still rely on Bluetooth to play music from your smartphone. So your connected device will need to be no more than 100 meters (328 feet) away. On the health front, Ear-On’s creator claims it can measure how many calories you burned, track your heart rate and even check on the condition of your ears. The company offers a special app where all that data is visualized in graphs. The app also includes a battery life tracker and a built-in music player. The company says you’ll get 10 hours of battery life, but doesn’t break down the specific capacity for each earbud. Ear-On also opts for gesture controls, allowing you to control the earbuds by swiping at the tip, which the company says is more natural than a physical button. Ear-On isn’t cheap. The earbuds start at $194 on Kickstarter and won’t ship until at least April 2017. The company is promising a lot in an impressively tiny package, but backing this one may be a bit of a risk. We wouldn’t be surprised if it ends up getting delayed or slightly modified before shipping. So just keep that in mind.

Ahrendts’ new title is, simply, Senior Vice President Retail. It appears the new title is a cosmetic change for its retail branding rather than a change in roles for Ahrendts. It’s my understanding that the title change is to better reflect Angela’s role that merges both retail stores and online retail operations, and not a result of any shift in responsibilities. Her updated bio still notes that she is responsible for “strategy, real estate & development, and operations of Apple’s physical stores, Apple’s online store and contact centers.” It seems likely the change could be part of an overall revamping of the company’s retail store branding. In August, Apple started removing the word “store” from its “Apple Store” retail listings, now referring to store locations as, for instance, “Apple Union Square” and “Apple Fifth Avenue”. Apple still refers to the “Apple Store” a few places on its website, and for its Apple Store iOS app, but those seem to be the last two things it will have to change to drop “store” entirely from its retail branding after the title change for Ahrendts. Ahrendts first joined Apple from her role as Burberry CEO in May of 2014 as the company’s Senior Vice Present of Retail and Online Stores, overseeing both its physical Apple retail locations and online store through Apple.com and the Apple Store iOS app. She became the highest paid female executive in the US through stocks and bonuses after starting her new position that year. Apple’s retail strategy for its iPhone 7 launch last month notably put more of a focus on its online pre-order and reservation systems than in years past. Most iPhone 7 stock was reserved for pre-orders, with a very limited supply of devices for walk-in customers leading to shorter lines and less scenes of Black Friday-like crowds at Apple retails stores in the US. Apple retail employees instead were often encouraging customers to order through Apple’s online systems, either for shipping to their home or a scheduled pick-up time at a local store. One theory is that the approach helps cut down on scalpers that purchase stock of iPhones on launch day to resell for more in markets where the device is not yet available. Apple also continued its iPhone Upgrade Program this year, meaning customers part of that program only had the option of reserving for in store pick-up at an Apple Store, something that also could have help cut down on lines outside of Apple stores and third-party retailers. Ahrendts has often been a public face of Apple since joining the company, making frequent appearances for new store openings and discussing the company’s retail operations in interviews. blog comments powered by Disqus Submit a Tip cancel Submitting a tip constitutes permission to publish and syndicate.

Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Oct 2, 2016 at 3:11PM Many growth investors like tech stocks because they occasionally generate market-crushing gains within just a few years. Over the past decade, e-commerce giant Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN)rallied nearly 2,500%, while Baidu -- the biggest search engine in China -- surged nearly 2,000%. Image source: Pixabay. Those gains look explosive, but many other tech stocks also bombed during those 10 years. Therefore, investors who are interested in this sector should remember five simple tips before buying their first tech stocks. 1. Understand what the company does The tech sector is filled with companies that promote "hot" technologies. However, investors often buy shares of these companies on an analyst recommendation without really understanding what they sell. As Warren Buffett famously said, "Never invest in a business you cannot understand." That's why Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is such a popular tech stock among both mainstream and institutional investors. Its business is easy to understand -- most of its revenue comes from its three hardware product lines (iPhone, iPad, Mac), but it's gradually pivoting toward paid services (Apple Pay, Apple Music, Apple Care) to reduce its dependence on hardware. Other companies have hidden strengths. Amazon is generally known as an e-commerce site, but its most profitable business is actually AWS (Amazon Web Services), the largest cloud platform in the world. The profits from that business offset the much lower margins at its marketplace business. 2. Look for market leaders When I invest in tech stocks, I generally look for "best-in-breed" market leaders. These leaders usually have strong pricing power, stable margins, and the ability to exploit economies of scale and bundling strategies to marginalize smaller rivals. Amazon exhibits all these qualities in both the e-commerce and cloud markets. Cisco has the same strengths in the networking equipment market, while Salesforce has similar advantages in the cloud-based customer relationship management market. 3. Always look forward The worst mistake a tech company can make is falling behind the tech curve. Yet larger tech companies often fall behind because they focus more on quarterly growth, dividends, or buybacks than boosting their research and development budgets. Market leaders, their egos boosted by temporary glory, also sometimes prematurely dismiss disruptive threats. Image source: Pixabay. That's precisely what happened to BlackBerry (NASDAQ:BBRY), which controlled a fifth of the smartphone market seven years ago. After its market share plunged to nearly 0%, it decided to stop producing its own smartphones in late September. The same can be said about Intel, which surrendered the mobile chip market to Softbank's ARM Holdings' licensees, and Microsoft, which ceded the mobile OS market to Apple and Alphabet's Google. If a tech company stops innovating and simply follows market trends, its high growth days might be over. That's what might be happening with Apple, which is pursuing "hot" markets like smartwatches and streaming music instead of launching new game-changing devices like the iPod and iPhone. 4. Understand the valuations Investors often pay big premiums for high-growth tech stocks, but these stocks can be solid investments if their valuations are supported by comparable earnings growth. Amazon, for example, trades at 79 times forward earnings, but is expected to deliver earnings growth of 80% next year.  However, these valuations can be tricky if a company posts explosive sales growth with widening losses. In these cases, investors should check the company's cash position and free cash flow to better analyze the health of the business. 5. Don't ignore "old tech" Many investors focus on the sexy high-growth tech stocks, but they should remember that slow growers like Cisco, Microsoft, Intel, and IBM are still great sources of stable income. These companies also buy back lots of stock, regularly raise their dividends, and trade at much lower multiples than higher-flying tech darlings -- making them ideal core holdings for your portfolio. The key takeaway The tech sector might seem overwhelming at first, but it all comes down to buying what you understand, identifying the market leaders and disruptors, and understanding their valuations. Investors who tick off these boxes while doing their due diligence might find some solid tech stocks to hold for the long run.

Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Oct 2, 2016 at 3:11PM Many growth investors like tech stocks because they occasionally generate market-crushing gains within just a few years. Over the past decade, e-commerce giant Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN)rallied nearly 2,500%, while Baidu -- the biggest search engine in China -- surged nearly 2,000%. Image source: Pixabay. Those gains look explosive, but many other tech stocks also bombed during those 10 years. Therefore, investors who are interested in this sector should remember five simple tips before buying their first tech stocks. 1. Understand what the company does The tech sector is filled with companies that promote "hot" technologies. However, investors often buy shares of these companies on an analyst recommendation without really understanding what they sell. As Warren Buffett famously said, "Never invest in a business you cannot understand." That's why Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is such a popular tech stock among both mainstream and institutional investors. Its business is easy to understand -- most of its revenue comes from its three hardware product lines (iPhone, iPad, Mac), but it's gradually pivoting toward paid services (Apple Pay, Apple Music, Apple Care) to reduce its dependence on hardware. Other companies have hidden strengths. Amazon is generally known as an e-commerce site, but its most profitable business is actually AWS (Amazon Web Services), the largest cloud platform in the world. The profits from that business offset the much lower margins at its marketplace business. 2. Look for market leaders When I invest in tech stocks, I generally look for "best-in-breed" market leaders. These leaders usually have strong pricing power, stable margins, and the ability to exploit economies of scale and bundling strategies to marginalize smaller rivals. Amazon exhibits all these qualities in both the e-commerce and cloud markets. Cisco has the same strengths in the networking equipment market, while Salesforce has similar advantages in the cloud-based customer relationship management market. 3. Always look forward The worst mistake a tech company can make is falling behind the tech curve. Yet larger tech companies often fall behind because they focus more on quarterly growth, dividends, or buybacks than boosting their research and development budgets. Market leaders, their egos boosted by temporary glory, also sometimes prematurely dismiss disruptive threats. Image source: Pixabay. That's precisely what happened to BlackBerry (NASDAQ:BBRY), which controlled a fifth of the smartphone market seven years ago. After its market share plunged to nearly 0%, it decided to stop producing its own smartphones in late September. The same can be said about Intel, which surrendered the mobile chip market to Softbank's ARM Holdings' licensees, and Microsoft, which ceded the mobile OS market to Apple and Alphabet's Google. If a tech company stops innovating and simply follows market trends, its high growth days might be over. That's what might be happening with Apple, which is pursuing "hot" markets like smartwatches and streaming music instead of launching new game-changing devices like the iPod and iPhone. 4. Understand the valuations Investors often pay big premiums for high-growth tech stocks, but these stocks can be solid investments if their valuations are supported by comparable earnings growth. Amazon, for example, trades at 79 times forward earnings, but is expected to deliver earnings growth of 80% next year.  However, these valuations can be tricky if a company posts explosive sales growth with widening losses. In these cases, investors should check the company's cash position and free cash flow to better analyze the health of the business. 5. Don't ignore "old tech" Many investors focus on the sexy high-growth tech stocks, but they should remember that slow growers like Cisco, Microsoft, Intel, and IBM are still great sources of stable income. These companies also buy back lots of stock, regularly raise their dividends, and trade at much lower multiples than higher-flying tech darlings -- making them ideal core holdings for your portfolio. The key takeaway The tech sector might seem overwhelming at first, but it all comes down to buying what you understand, identifying the market leaders and disruptors, and understanding their valuations. Investors who tick off these boxes while doing their due diligence might find some solid tech stocks to hold for the long run.

Apple’s proprietary Metal graphics APIs, as well as OS X (now referred to by Apple simply as macOS) are specifically mentioned in the job postings,” Hibben writes. “There can be no doubt that Nvidia is hiring software engineers to develop graphics drivers for the Mac.” “Most likely, the new postings indicate that the effort is fairly new and any products featuring Nvidia graphics processors would probably not reach consumers before next year,” Hibben writes. “It’s been widely assumed that AMD would be in expected refreshes of desktop and notebook Macs. A Mac Pro refresh has been long overdue, as has a refresh of the MacBook Pros. Many have wondered why it’s taking so long for Apple to update the hardware in these still very important product lines and have pointed to this delay as a sign of stagnation. I think it is perplexing that a company with Apple’s resources would not be able to upgrade the Mac product lines with the latest CPU and GPU offerings as soon as they become available. I certainly don’t buy the Apple stagnation hypothesis. One possible explanation is that Apple had been expecting Polaris to be available for its iMac and MacBook Pros… Chances are that when Polaris notebook GPUs become available, that’s when we’ll see the new Macs.” Much more in the full article here.

Comment Feed 10 Comments macnificentseven48 Tuesday, September 27, 2016 - 5:49 pm · Reply Apple seems to be heavily into green computers so I wouldn’t expect Apple to be coming out with computers sporting the latest powerful graphics processors. I’ve seen the size of those graphics cards and how much heat they give off. I can understand they’re definitely not something Apple wants in its computers. Apple seems to have chosen its path for its consumer computers and it’s a low-power path. I think that’s fine for most home computer users. The Mac Pro is (or should be) the only exception. A monitor with a built-in graphics card seems like an interesting idea although I’m not sure how practical that is. Apple has got some weird ways of doing things. It’s OK. If I don’t like they way they’re building computers, I can always buy some other company’s products. However, I’m sticking with my Macs. peterblood71 Tuesday, September 27, 2016 - 6:51 pm · Reply AMD video cards don’t interest me in a new Mac Pro. Nvidia does with it’s CUDA acceleration capability. Having talked with the guy who actually designs the darn things at the last Siggraph Nvidia is the video card company of the moment. In any case Apple needs to give all pro’s options and not just one video card type fits all. Almux Wednesday, September 28, 2016 - 4:15 am · Reply Yes, CUDA is a MUST and it HAS TO be working as standard on MBP! technicalconclusions Wednesday, September 28, 2016 - 3:27 pm · Reply CUDA is nVidia hardware specific. OpenCL is not. Nobody is going to write code specific for CUDA on any scale. peterblood71 Wednesday, September 28, 2016 - 4:44 pm · Reply You mean like Adobe, most of whom’s pro applications use CUDA? Not a very good technical conclusion on your part now is it? Back to tech school for you. technicalconclusions Wednesday, September 28, 2016 - 4:52 pm · Reply My post said “on scale” meaning a large percentage of applications that will accelerate for GPU compute. For that matter, your comment is misleading as Adobe does OpenCL as well. Example: http://www.provideocoalition.com/adobe-premiere-pro-and-multiple-gpus/ peterblood71 Wednesday, September 28, 2016 - 4:57 pm · Reply Your argument is pointless if the need is accelerating Adobe apps. Hopefull all can be accommodated. technicalconclusions Wednesday, September 28, 2016 - 5:03 pm · Reply Your argument is pointless as we’re talking about general technologies, not the specifics of one particular developer. Developers don’t want to write and optimize for a GPU vendor specific basis if they don’t have to. Cuda predates OpenCL and had initial early support. I’m not knocking Cuda as a technology. Rather, I’m knocking Cuda as the future path for GPU compute. Sure, in an ideal world, accommodate both. However, if resources are limited (and they usually are), then writing for OpenCL will go a lot further as it will be supported across hardware vendors. That’s reality… don’t be so defensive. peterblood71 Wednesday, September 28, 2016 - 5:45 pm · Reply Your argument is pointless too since Adobe hasn’t yet made those changes. Please give them the benefit of your expertise and show them the way. I don’t give a darn what technology will accelerate graphics apps, pick one we all can agree on and get ‘r done. I hate this one card good for one thing and another card good for something else so you better have the right card business. nevermark Wednesday, September 28, 2016 - 10:35 pm · Reply I think you are not well informed. Sometimes open/general technology wins, but often it does not. NVidia’s CUDA has huge widespread support throughout engineering, scientific, financial and other heavy compute applications. Nvidia pioneered GPUs as general purpose parallel computing devices, creates fantastic CUDA libraries for specific types of calculations, and lots of vendors have standardized on CUDA. I would know, I only develop for CUDA because all the products in the same ecosystem only use CUDA. Its been a rough time no having MacBook Pro’s and especially a Mac Pro that supports CUDA.

The speed increase will help watch apps run more smoothly, and plenty of great software is available to take the improved watches for a test drive. One Apple Watch app that is immediately interesting for its simplicity is Glimpse. The new free app essentially replaces your regular time display with a photo drawn from online sources. Each time you raise your wrist to check the time, Glimpse drops a different photo onto the display. It’s like a constant feed of news and social media updates, in tiny bite-size form. Glimpse can be connected to content sources like CNN, National Geographic and Time magazine. There is also an option to connect your Pinterest and Twitter accounts. Glimpse grabs images from these sources, updating them throughout the day. You can, of course, still see the time and other information like the weather and your exercise status using Apple’s built-in complications feature. Things offers interactive lists that help manage your daily life, including work tasks with a deadline, shopping lists and personal goals. The main interface of Things is on your iPhone, where you build a suite of to-do lists, adding a headline title and notes, deadlines and so on. You can see the lists on your watch, where you can mark items as read and add items by voice. The voice recognition feature works well, even in noisy environments like a busy aisle in a supermarket, though you do have to get over the embarrassment of talking to your watch. Things is $10 (Rs 665). Babel, the language-learning app, is also on Apple Watch, and uses a clever trick to teach new words and phrases. The app detects where you are and shows relevant words and phrases in the form of a language quiz on the watch screen. For example, as I sat in a cafe in Portugal, Babel set up a quiz asking what the Portuguese word “açúcar” meant. I correctly tapped “sugar.” You’re not going to become fluent using this watch app alone, but its short, context-based language learning quizzes can help words stick in your memory. Babel is free. Built-in GPS is the signature new feature on the Apple Watch Series 2, and one of the first apps to take advantage of the sensor will be ViewRanger. This is a popular hiking and biking app that does a good job of routing you across the countryside and tracking your trekking progress. It shows navigational information and statistics, and buzzes when you need to make a turn. With a coming update, ViewRanger will work with the new Apple Watch’s GPS system for even more precise location awareness. As long as you preset your route before entering the wilderness, the app will work without your phone’s needing a cellphone signal; your phone could even be turned off to preserve battery power. ViewRanger is free. Games on the Apple Watch have always been a bit halfhearted, but the new “Field Day” app works well on the device’s tiny screen. You manage a farm, planting crops in a field to fill orders placed for products like carrots and grain. You control the cartoon-style game via the watch’s touch screen and rotating crown, which takes a bit of getting used to, but feels natural after a while. Sometimes you will be sent to your iPhone’s “Field Day” app to, for example, chat to the baker about what he would like you to grow for him. On the whole, this is a simple game that is fun and free. Last, for a peek into a potential future for online shopping, check out Fancy. This is an image-based free shopping app that shows a wide variety of attractive (and sometimes strange) clothes and other products, and you can select things to buy right on your wrist. Some of the prices are astonishing. In general I would see this as more of a shopping experiment than a regular app, but it’s worth a look.

Here are some tricks to get the most out of the operating system.  ( Apple ) Advertisement Discovering what lies hidden in the new iPhone 7 or an older device running iOS 10 can be fun if you have a list of top features. Apple launched the iPhone 7 Plus along with its smaller sibling on Sept. 7 and followed up with the release of iOS 10. Older devices like last year's iPhone 6s lineup have also received iOS 10 since then. Among the features discovered on iOS 10 is a magnifying glass that can be enabled and then used to read small print. A list of 10 other simple tricks for iOS 10 is outlined below: Access The Camera From The Lock Screen Smartphone cameras are increasingly complex but the process to use one has been simplified on iOS 10. Swiping to the right when you see the lock screen will bring up the camera app, which can then be used to capture fleeting moments that would otherwise be missed. Get Siri To Locate Photos Getting Siri to locate photos is an easy way to get quick access to old photos. Users just have to open Siri and say, "Show me photos from July 8," which will pull up shots taken on the day. Open Two Webpages Side By Side iOS 10 has also arrived on tablets so users can view two webpages in split view. All they have to do is press and hold a link when using Safari and they will be presented with the "Open in Split" option. Quick Access To Camera With 3D Touch With both the iPhone 6s lineup and the iPhone 7 lineup coming with 3D Touch, Apple has used the technology to provide quick access to camera modes. Users just have to press the Camera app icon on the home screen, which will result in a quick action menu with selfie, slow motion and video options being displayed. Find Parked Cars The Apple Maps app on iOS 10 has also been improved as it can now be used to locate a parked car. This feature works as the iPhone senses when a user is driving a car, and once they stop and park it, the location is marked on Apple Maps and displayed in a notification. Receive Small Size Photos In Messages Users on a limited data plan or who want to save money can choose to get smaller images in iMessage. They can set this up by navigating to Settings, Messages, then choosing the "Low Quality Image Mode." ZDNet says this option is also useful in case of a "poor signal" quality in an area. Search For Photos Using Facial Recognition The Photos app on iOS 10 now comes with facial recognition and upon navigating to Albums then People, users can check those who are identified and more. Siri can also be used to search for photos of a particular person who was photographed in the past. Replace Text With Emojis Using the iMessage app people can change words with emojis. All they have to do is tap the button for emoji within a Message. Once this is done, all the words that can be replaced will be highlighted in orange and they can then be replaced. Get A Reminder To Go To Bed The Clock app can now be used to set a time to head to bed. Once this is enabled by navigating to Clock app then to Bedtime, users will hear an alarm. Add Stickers To Messages Within the iMessage app users can now download sticker packs for games like Super Mario Run or Fallout Shelter and use them when they're sending a text. As users delve into the new features available in iOS 10, more hidden gems are likely to be uncovered in the coming days as the iPhone 7 starts arriving in the hands of users. It remains to be seen, however, if the iPhone 7 lineup will end up being plagued by more instances of explosion in transit.

Follow TechnoBuffalo What place does an Apple Watch have in a restaurant? Until recently, it probably only existed on the wrists of diners and servers who owned the wearable for other reasons. Now, though, one restaurant thinks it can use the Apple Watch to keep operations running smoothly. According to Eater, Union Square Cafe will deploy the Apple Watch across its employees to help track wait times, orders and more. “When a VIP walks through the front door, someone orders a bottle of wine, a new table is seated, a guest waits too long to order her or his drink, or a menu item runs out, every manager will get an alert via the tiny computer attached to their wrist,” Eater explained. All of this information will pass through an iPad with the ResyOS reservation application as the brains of the operation, Eater explained. And it isn’t meant for the servers bringing you your food, but rather management and other folks who are in charge of how seamless the dining experience is. In another example, Eater said that a manager could receive an alert and make sure coats are ready at the coat check. The idea is to eliminate unnecessary obstacles, though one has to wonder if this also sort of creates a bigger problem where one might not always exist. Sure, a busy restaurant in the winter may have a confusing coat-room, but I’ve rarely found it too much of a wait in fancy restaurants that are already focused on customer service. And a missed alert on an Apple Watch, perhaps because a manager or other employee was doing something else, could make things worse for the customer. I’m curious to see how this pans out and if other restaurants begin to adopt the same idea.

Resend activation e-mail Law & Disorder / Civilization & Discontents Patent troll VirnetX beats Apple again, awarded $302M in FaceTime damages Patent holder will seek millions more over whether Apple willfully infringed. by David Kravets - Oct 2, 2016 5:38 pm UTC Login to bookmark 138 VirnetX is litigating the road to riches in a patent lawsuit against Apple. Bloomberg via Getty Images An East Texas jury concluded late Friday that Apple must pay a patent troll $302.4 million in damages for infringing two patents connected to Apple's FaceTime communication application. The verdict is the third in the long-running case in which two earlier verdicts were overturned—one on appeal and the other by the Tyler, Texas federal judge presiding over the 6-year-long litigation. The latest outcome is certain to renew the same legal arguments that were made in the earlier cases: Apple, for one, has maintained all along that the evidence doesn't support infringement. VirnetX, as it did in the past and is now doing, is seeking more damages for what it says is "willful" infringement on Apple's part. What's more, in the previous litigation, the Nevada patent-holding company had asked the judge to shutter the Apple service at issue. Apple has maintained that such a demand was made "So that it can be used to extract a massive licensing fee." The case began with four of VirnetX's patents (1, 2, 3, 4), which had originated at a company called Science Applications International Corporation, or SAIC. VirnetX has been saying for years that it plans to market various products, but its income comes from licensing patents. The latest verdict (PDF) had the jury consider only the amount of damages in the "504 patent" and the "211 patent." Two months ago, US District Judge Robert Schroeder ordered a new trial and wiped out the previous $625.6 million in damages that a different jury concluded Apple owed. Schroeder said that the complex trial, as well as repeated references to an earlier verdict against Apple that was overturned on appeal, created "potential for juror confusion" and unfairly prejudiced Apple. The next stage of the case is where VirnetX will seek damages for willful infringement. In the last case, the company sought $190 million. No hearing date has been set.

Black Friday Tech Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Holiday Gifts Cyber Monday     Everything We Know About 2017 MacBook Pro Posted: Oct 27 2016, 10:43am CDT | by Ahmed Humayun, in News | Apple     Its been a long time since Apple updated its MacBook lineup and now we have concrete evidence about a major update coming up for Apple's flagship Mac devices. Here is what we know about the 2017 MacBook Pro. The MacBook is considered to be one of the most powerful and productive laptops in the industry and this fall we are expecting a sizzling update in the machine. The Retina MacBook Pro has two versions which include the 13 and 15 inch machines. This fall it is expected that an update will occur which will include a thinner body and many people are looking forward to the lighter touch panel which includes a touch pad ID functionality. Don't Miss: The Amazon Black Friday 2016 Ad What is coming up in the next MacBook Retina Pro Design Alterations Authentic sources such as KGI securities and Bloomberg have given out the verdict that Apple will be giving out the new version of the MacBook Pro 13 and 15 inch this fall 2016. It is expected that the machines could be out as early as October which makes sense as Apple is aiming to release the mac software mac0S 10.12.1 also in October. This way we will be able to see the updated version by late October. The MacBook Pros is anticipated to have a much thinner and lighter composition than what we observe currently. However the body of the machine is not expected to be tampered with like we saw in other versions such as MacBook Air and Retina Macbook. You will be able to enjoy shallower curves on the edges. The track pad is also improved to be wide pressure sensitive along with a flatter and smoother keyboard. Other changes in the keyboard include an OLED display touch panel at the top of the keyboard which replaces the conventional physical keys. Apple has named this as the dynamic function row. It is also rumoured that the new version will have support for touch ID and thunderbolt 3. The touch ID button will most probably be included in the power button. Currently you see the power button right aside the function keys and it will stay there as it is in the most logical position it can be in. There are other rumors afloat which suggest that the OLED touch panel will be contextual. The panel might have buttons which change upon the app in use. Martin Hajek a designer has established a mockup of the Retinal MacBook Pro as it would look with an OLED touch panel. Kuo believes that the new MacBook Pro models have the most significant upgrades Apple has ever undertaken. The new Models will also include metal injection mould made hinges and butterfly mechanism keyboards which we have seen earlier in the 12 inch MacBook. In the past we have seen rumours which stated that Apple is developing ultra thin 13 and 15 inch MacBooks but it was unclear which line did the MacBook belong to but now with the information provided by Kuo it is pretty much suggestion that the information pertains to the MacBook Pro Line. We were able to see photos in May which said to depict components for the upcoming Retina MacBook Pro. The images gave the first look of the thin body device. They included the body of the 13 inch MacBook Pro but missing were the cutouts for the function row. There was a blank space instead where the OLED is expected to be placed. The sides of the device had four USB-C ports and a singular head phone jack. It isn’t for certain that these images give us the first look to our genuine MacBook but they certainly fall in line with the rumors we have heard about the MacBook Pro till now. Specifications Apple Retina MacBook Pro updates have been out of line in the previous two years because of the delay going on with the Intel chips. Apple launched the 13 and 15 inch Retina MacBook Pro at staggering times in 2015 only due to Broadwell. In fact the 13 inch model observed an update in March and the 15 inch model in May 2015. The 13 inch Retina MacBook pro works with Broadwell chips but the 15 inch continues with its previous generation Haswell chips. Apple is still waiting for Skylake chips from Intel and this 15 inch Retina MacBook will see a higher performance boost. The appropriate Skylake chips to be included in the 15 inch Retina MacBook Pro were shown in the price lists by Intel in Mid January and the 13 inch Retina MacBook Pro appropriate chips were announced in September. These chips are sought to be available to Apple in the initial months of 2016. A new series of Xeon E3 can also be potentially used in the 15 inch Retina MacBook Pro. This can boost CPU, memory, performance and even graphics but due to pricing constraints the Core i7 Skylake chips are more likely to be Apple’s choice. The new MacBook Pros are anticipated to contain much powerful graphic cards aiming the video gamers and other professionals who are in need of GPU power.Another rumor is that there might be an option for high performance through the Polaris graphics chip which gives more power but in a slimmer package. Date of Release The initial rumors had us thinking that ultra thin 13 and 15 inch MacBook would be introduced in the second quarter of 2016 but later on rumors suggested they will not be released till fall 2016. October is the month which is thought to be the one containing the potential release date. However the latest details regarding Apple’s software masOS10.12.1 which include its release on October 7 suggest that Apple is aiming to finalize the whole package and the timeline indicates the machines will be launched in late October. The Current Available Models On march 9 2015 Apple hosted a media event name ‘Spring forward’ in which it released the updated 13 inch Retinal Mac Book Pro. The updated version contained several improvements. A new Broadwell processor was included as well as improved Intel graphics. The battery was also upgraded and a Force touch trackpad. 13 inch Retinal MacBook Pro The 13 inch Retina MacBook Pro comprises of Broadwell Processors and when compared to the old generation Haswell processors gives more improved performance and better battery life. The improved battery life is deemed to give at least 12 hours of itunes movie playback. Many internal upgrades have been made but the outer design is the same has the previous generation laptops. It has 2560x1600 wide and 227 pixel per inch Retina display. Its weight is 3.48 pounds and is approximately 0.71 inches thick. This laptop is more focused on performance rather than portability. Basic configurations are available at different prices which depend on the processor chosen as well as storage space. Processing, Graphics And Storage The Geekbench 3 benchmarks is of the opinion that the Broad well chips in the 13 inch Retina MacBook Pros’s only give a rather small advantage over their predecessors. This comes as no surprise as Broadwell is more focused on efficiency and battery life rather than simple processing power. However, in general in certain bench mark tests a 3 to 7 percent increase has been seen in performance.The 13 inch Retina MacBook Pro also comes with a upgraded Intel Iris Graphics 6100 which is thought to be a bit more faster than the GeForce 820M. You will be disappointed as there is no discrete graphics card to add in the 13 inch MackBook Pro but there is an option in the 15 inch. Apple has stated that the 2015 version of the 13 inch Retina MacBook Pro has an upgraded flash storage which is at least two times faster than the older generation machines. Certain independent tests have confirmed that the flash storage is actually faster than the older models. 15 inch Retina MacBook Pro The 15 inch Retina MacBook Pro was updated on may 19 2015 by Apple. Due to the delays made by Intel it does not feature Broadwell processors but the 2015 version does have many of the same improvements in the 13 inch Retina MacBook Pro. The 15 inch Retinal MacBook Pro also includes a Force touch track pad, it has also has improved graphics from AMD, a faster storage and a battery life of about 8 to 9 hours. Interestingly the solid state drive included in the 15 inch Retina MacBook Pro is the greatest notebook drive the company has yet introduced. It can reach speeds of about to 2GB which is almost 2.5 times more than the SSD in the older generation 15 inch Retina MacBook Pro. Non Retina MacBook Pro The non Retina MacBook Pro has not been updated by Apple and do not contain Haswell processors and thus Apple has stopped selling the 15 inch non Retina MacBook Pro but still continues to sell the 13 inch non Retina MacBook Pro. This has not updated since June 2012. The reconfiguration had a cut of dollar. Recently the non Retina MacBook Pro is almost the same price as the Retina MacBook Pro so it is likely that Apple will discontinue its production of non Retina models at some point and time.

Jennings is questionable with a thumb injury, Rodgers-Cromartie is questionable with a groin injury and Apple is doubtful with a hamstring injury.  Safety Nat Berhe (concussion) was the only player who did not travel, according to the team. He had already been ruled out for the game. Right tackle Marshall Newhouse (calf), defensive tackle Robert Thomas (illness) and safety Darian Thompson (foot) have also been ruled out, but they made the trip to Minnesota.  Apple is unlikely to play, but the Giants are not yet ruling him out. Rodgers-Cromartie has a chance to play Monday, but it is unclear how strong of a chance he has to be active. According to NFL injury reporting guidelines, a questionable designation should indicate a player has a 50-50 chance to be active.  If Apple and Rodgers-Cromartie are both inactive, the Giants are expected to start Trevin Wade at one cornerback position opposite Janoris Jenkins, with Leon Hall in the slot and rookie Michael Hunter in a reserve role.  Giants are hurting right now ESPN reported Jennings would miss a second straight game due to his thumb injury on Wednesday. But the veteran running back and head coach Ben McAdoo have, at least publicly, expressed some optimism his injury could progress to the point where he plays against the Vikings. If Jennings is active, he will likely be limited. Orleans Darkwa and Bobby Rainey are expected to receive the bulk of the work in the backfield.  The Giants will have just two healthy safeties on Monday night - Landon Collins and rookie Andrew Adams. The team worked out several veteran safeties on Sunday morning, but the agent for one of the workout players tweeted the Giants will not make any roster moves until after Monday's game.  GIANTS INJURY REPORT: Out: SS Nat Berhe (concussion), FS Darian Thompson (foot), RT Marshall Newhouse (calf), DT Robert Thomas (illness) Doubtful: CB Eli Apple (hamstring) Questionable: RB Rashad Jennings (thumb), CB Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie (groin) VIKINGS INJURY REPORT: OUT: DT Sharrif Floyd (knee), TE David Morgan (knee) James Kratch may be reached at jkratch@njadvancemedia.com.

A jury has found Apple guilty of infringing on VirnetX’s patents and has ordered it to pay the company $302.4 million in damages. This case is now going to go to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington DC. This isn’t the first time that VirnetX and Apple have been involved in a patent battle. It sued Apple back in 2010 claiming infringement on four of its patents. It was awarded $368.2 million in damages but the case was dismissed by the U.S. Court of Appeals. A second trial took place earlier this year in which VirnetX was awarded $625.5 million but a trial judge overturned the verdict and ruled in Apple’s favor. VirnetX has now been awarded $302.4 million but it’s not like it’s going to get this amount right away. This case is headed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington DC which has a long history of ruling on patent disputes. It’s going to examine whether or not Apple really did infringe on the patents with FaceTime and if it becomes convinced of that only then will VirnetX be able to get the money. Filed in Apple.

But this surely doesn't make the company immune to disgruntled customers. The company recently faced the wrath of an angry Apple customer who simply walked in one of the company's store and smashed over 10 iPhones and a few MacBook Air. According to a video posted by a Twitter user @Quentin_IOS, a man walked inside an Apple Store in France and smashed handsets with a pentaque ball. For those unaware, a pentaque ball is hard and is used in bowling game. The original video has been taken down from Twitter but is available on YouTube. READ ALSO: Apple iPhone 7 explodes in transit: Report The Twitter user who posted the video did not reveal the name of the person in the video but confirmed that the incident took place in Dijon, a city in France. Although the man in the video is talking in French, as per the captions provided by others for the video, the man said that ladies and gentlemen, Apple is a company that violated European consumers' rights. He added that the company did not refund him for his broken device. "They refused to reimburse me, I told them 'Give me my money back'. They said no. So you know what's happening? This is happening," he reportedly said. The angry customer is seen being escorted out of the store by security personnel soon after. Apple has so far not made any statement on the matter. > In India, Apple has partnered with Flipkart to sell its latest iPhones. The Bengaluru-based e-tailer's platform Flipkart will source iPhone 7 directly from Apple, unlike previous years when it would source the phones from third-party sellers. This is the first time that Apple has partnered with a consumer-facing online player to sell latest iPhones. Infibeam, which has been an Apple partner for some years, will also receive the new iPhones directly, but it is known more as a bulk seller, one that does not deal with consumers directly.

Check. Better low-light camera? Check. OLED screen? With the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, Apple has caught up to Samsung's Galaxy S7 in some key areas, but the display isn't one of them. According to a Bloomberg report, Apple is in talks with Sharp to supply OLED screens for next-generation iPhones. Yes, the iPhone 7 offers a screen that's 25 percent brighter with a wider color gamut, but it's not as sharp and certainly not as colorful as the Super AMOLED panel on the Galaxy S7, S7 Edge and red-hot Note 7. MORE: 29 Hidden iOS 10 Features You Need to Try OLED screens have a number of benefits over the traditional LCDs in the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. For one, they offer more saturated colors, which really make photos and videos pop. Second, OLED screens tend to offer better contrast, because they are capable of displaying pure blacks. The iPhone can look a little cloudy when displaying black. It doesn't end there. OLED screens offer wider viewing angles than LCD panels, so someone else can binge watch that episode of Luke Cage when they're sitting next to you. Lastly, an OLED iPhone should last longer on a charge, because the technology promises less battery drain. Sharp says it will be investing $566 million for the development of its OLED production facilities, with the goal of starting output by June 2018. But that doesn't mean the iPhone won't get an OLED screen before then. The Bloomberg report says that Apple is trying to encourage more competition among its suppliers.

Home Church & Ministries U.S. World Politics Entertainment living Opinion iPad Mini 5 Latest News and Rumors: Release Date, A10 Processor, Camera, Other Features and Price Details By Neal A. Lasta Oct 2, 2016 | 8:14 AM After the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus were introduced last September 7, 2016, Apple fans are now focusing on the release of other devices, such as the iPad Mini 5. Rumors have surfaced regarding the release date, specs and features of the device. Let's look at some of these rumors. Release Date Rumors suggest that the iPad Mini 5 will be released in the first quarter of 2017. Specifically, in March 2017, analysts believe several Apple devices will be introduced along with the iPad Mini 5. These include the iPad Pro 2 and the iPad Pro Mini. There are even rumors that the iPad Mini 5 will not be released at all, but will come with a different name. A10 processor Yes, I want Breaking Christian News Submit Some rumors propose that the reason for the delay of the iPad Mini 5's release is because Apple is waiting for the availability of the A10 processor. Currently, Apple devices use the A9 processor, but this rumor suggests the company is ready for an upgrade. Camera The iPad Mini 5 is rumored to have an 8-megapixel rear camera and a 1.2-megapixel front camera. 3D Touch Pressure-Sensitive Display This new feature will most likely be realized if the iPad Mini 5 uses A10 processors. 3D Touch is available for the iPhone 7. It revolutionizes the way we interact with our touch screens. It detects various pressures and offers different selections for each. Other features Like the iPhone 7, the iPad Mini 5 might get rid of the headphone jack. Removing the headphone jack will provide for a more stream-lined design and extra space inside the iPad Mini 5. That makes the iPad Mini even slimmer and lighter than it already is. The home button might also be replaced with a touch-sensitive key. The tablet is also rumored to have an impressive 5124 mAh battery. However, another rumor suggests that the iPad Mini 5 will use a battery with less power, since it will be relying on the A10 processor for efficiency. Having a reduced battery would also reduce the size of the actual device. In addition, the iPad Mini 5 might also have quick charge technology similar to Qualcomm's. The iPad Mini 5 is also expected to have a larger size than its predecessor with a 9.7-inch screen diagonal. It will have a Retina display, 3 GB RAM, and incorporate the Apple Pencil. The device will also come in three versions: 32 GB, 64 GB and 128 GB. Price Rumors report that the iPad Mini 5 will have a starting price of $450. There are also speculations that the 16 GB version of the iPad Mini 5 will be priced at $399.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Samsung Changes the Ball Game with Next-Gen Universal Remote Controller for Home Automation | Main | Photos of Google's all-new 'Pixel' Smartphone that Officially Launches Tomorrow Surface » October 02, 2016 New iPhone 6 'Touch Disease' Class Action Lawsuits Filed against Apple in Canada is a Troublesome Trend   In late August Patently Apple posted a report covering the first class action lawsuit against Apple for a problem with its touch sensory functionality that iFixit dubbed 'Touch Disease.' The Apple device teardown experts discovered a problem that was growing in the Apple community where iPhone 6 models were losing their ability to accept touch commands. The defect stems from a change that Apple made in the design changing a metal cover to one that is made of cloth. If the iPhone is handled roughly over time or is dropped the touch sensors apparently get slightly disconnected causing a misfire for touch commands. I must confess that my own iPhone 6 is now beginning to give me grief – so this isn't theoretical. It's now being reported in Canada today that another class action has been started in Canada.   In September, Merchant's firm, Merchant Law Group, filed two class actions against Apple, one Canada-wide and one solely for Quebec residents.   The Canadian lawyer in Regina, Saskatchewan, Tony Merchant claims that "As they began to have more and more complaints and people were going to them — and we've had significant numbers of people contact us — they brushed it under the rug."   The proposed suit, filed at the Court of Queen's Bench for Saskatchewan, would include all Canadian iPhone 6 and 6 Plus customers. It alleges that Apple was negligent because it supplied a defective phone, "knowingly and intentionally concealed" from customers the defect and failed to provide a proper remedy.   Merchant claims the most Apple has done for customers is offer to resolve the problem for a price — around $300. Apple declined to comment on any of the suits, which have yet to be certified in court.   The iPhone 6 is 'a piece of crap'   "You miss calls, you can't text, it's a horrible piece of crap," says Trina Rae Wiegers, the lead plaintiff in the cross-Canada suit.     Shortly after the product was launched in 2014, Wiegers bought the iPhone 6 in Prince Albert, Sask., where she lives. She paid about $200 — hundreds of dollars less than the regular price because she locked into a two-year phone plan contract.   Wiegers claims that earlier this year, a few months after the warranty had expired, her phone began to intermittently freeze up and wouldn't respond to touch commands.   "It's frustrating as hell because you're missing phone calls from your kids. I have three kids. I use it for work," says Wiegers, who's employed with the city of Prince Albert.   The suit alleges that that the underlying problem is the touchscreen controller chips in the phone's motherboard, which are not properly secured and can malfunction with regular use.   Not Apple's problem?   Wiegers says she contacted Apple numerous times about her defective phone and never got a satisfactory response. She shared with CBC News a transcript of her online chat in August with senior adviser "Dave" from Apple Support.   Dave responded that he had no information that the problem was "known to be a manufacturing issue from Apple."   He also reminded Wiegers that her warranty had expired and that she'd have to get the phone repaired. He recommended that she visit the Apple feedback site where she could "tell engineering to look into it." He signed off with a :) happy face.   "I just about felt like throwing my phone through the screen at him," says Wiegers.   You have to wonder if the frustration expressed by Trina Rae Wiegers is the very frustration expressed by a disgrunteled Apple customer in France this week where he took his anger out in the store by smashing 16 iPhones and a MacBook. While it's unknown what that customers problem with the Apple product was, if it ends up being related to the 'touch disease' issue, this could open the door to a class action being filed in France. For now it's an open question.   In the end if Apple continues to outright deny this problem exists and it spreads further, Apple could have a Samsung-like problem on their hands. Over time as most iPhone 6 warranties come to an end, customers having to fork over $300 + to fix a problem that is primarily Apple's redesign problem is going to come to a nasty head in public. This is something that Apple doesn't need right now as they're trying to pump up their iPhone 7 sales for the holidays.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Home Church & Ministries U.S. World Politics Entertainment living Opinion MacBook Air 2016 Release Date, Specs and Features: Will Apple Laptop Come with an Improved Trackpad and Apple Pencil? By Neal A. Lasta Oct 1, 2016 | 11:25 PM Apple has not released any statement regarding the MacBook Air 2016 or even the MacBook Pro, but nothing's keeping tech analysts or fans from coming up with rumors based on leaks, trends, or mere speculations. Release Date There is no official word from Apple regarding the release of their latest rendition of the MacBook Air. There have been rumors, though, saying that the MacBook Air 2016 will actually be released this month. In an interview with Forbes, Rhoda Alexander, IHS Markit Technology Director for Tablet and Notebook PCs, said, "Apple is planning to release some of the new Mac products as soon as October. The updated line includes tweaked MacBook Air devices with multi-functional USB-C port technology and iMacs with an option for new graphics chips from Advanced Micro Devices." Yes, I want Breaking Christian News Submit Alexander added that Apple actually already started producing the MacBook Air 2016 during the second quarter of this year. However, other rumors report that Apple is waiting for Kaby Lake processors to be made so that they could use it on their new MacBooks. Kaby Lake processors are better than the current Skylake processors when it comes to providing better graphics. Specs Apple's MacBook Air 2016 is rumored to have AMD's Polaris-based graphics cards. It will also come with Retina display and a USB Type-C port. Polaris graphics cards are a huge upgrade from the current MacBook Air model, which uses Intel HD Graphics 6000. The laptop is also rumored to use NVIDIA graphics. This speculation comes largely from a job vacancy announced by Apple for a team in charge of creating NVIDIA Mac graphics drivers. This implies that NVIDIA and Apple are collaborating to enhance the graphics of upcoming, highly anticipated devices such as the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro 2016. However, both firms haven't said a word about their partnership yet. Trackpad and Apple Pencil The MacBook Air 2016 is also rumored to have a trackpad coupled with a much-improved Apple Pencil. The new Apple Pencil is said to have an "inertial sensor" with various modes, such as rotational controller mode, joystick mode and air mouse mode. Techradar also said that the MacBook Air 2016 will be much larger than its predecessor, going from having an 11-inch diagonal previously to the new 15-inch diagonal. Just Rumors As most rumors go, odds are not all of these won't be realized, so fans should wait for the official statement from Apple regarding the release of the MacBook Air 2016 and its features and specs. In fact, back in July, MacBook Air was rumored to vanish for good, replaced by MacBook Pro instead. We'll just wait and see.

Home Industry Tech ‘Made by Google’: Here’s what to expect at Pixel launch event on October 4 ‘Made by Google’: Here’s what to expect at Pixel launch event on October 4 Google Pixel launch: After Apple's grand event in San Francisco last month, its time for Google to show off its products. In a move, very unlikely of the tech giant, it is going to present a major event in San Francisco on October 4. By: Sumit Chakraborty | Updated: October 3, 2016 5:44 PM Google Pixel launch: When the anticipated Nexus 7 tablet was launched at a Google event in San Francisco, California, in 2013. (Picture: Reuters) After Apple’s grand event in San Francisco last month, its time for Google to show off its products. In a move, very unlikely of the tech giant, it is going to present a major event in San Francisco on October 4. Based on various reports and rumours, some of the products that the company may unveil can be expected, but the thing which has the maximum possibility is that it will be a majorly hardware specific launch event. Apart from the new Chromecast, the new virtual assistant, a router, Amazon echo rival, the most notable announcement that is expected to be at the Google launch is the brand new smartphone. Google has already planned to ditch the Nexus brand of smartphones and instead bring out the new Pixel. As Google is all set to make some major hardware announcements on October 4, consumers can still see some signs of the changes and guess what to expect. Google has an annual ritual of announcing its flagship smartphones, yet this year appears to be distinct. Google in an enigmatic new advertisement had shown a box, devoid of context which metamorphosised into a rectangular shape symbolising a smartphone alongside the Google logo and ‘Oct 4’ written. Apart from that, Google is expected to unwrap its latest Andromeda OS which is a hybrid of Android and Chrome OS. Google has done something which it has never done when it comes to hardware, present a very aggressive marketing strategy, by its ‘Made by Google’ logo. Here are a few things we can expect at the October 4 launch event: Pixel smartphones: Pixel and Pixel XL, if launched will undeniably be the superstars of the evening. There have been numerous rumours doing the rounds about Google’s new branded smartphones since a long time, and it remains to be seen how many such amazing tech can it pack in them. Pixel will replace Google’s long-standing Nexus program, and it will be produced with Google’s name itself, unlike nexus which was produced by other smartphone manufacturers. Both the smartphones are expected to come in different sizes, somewhere around 5 to 5.5 inches. These phones should be powered by the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor, 4GB of RAM, 1080p or quad HD displays. Cameras should be a minimum of 12 MP. Add to it the new technology of fingerprint scanners and bigger batteries. These features will be seen much before they can be seen in any other premium Android models. When it comes to body and design, Google will leave no stones unturned to make a smartphone with a great build. Apart from this great hardware, Google will also unveil the latest operating system called the Android Nougat 7.0. The only hitch in these phones is the pricing. With an expected price of $649, Pixel smartphones may be a disappointment to many as this kind of pricing is in the range of top models of other brands. Also read | ‘Made by Google’ Teaser: What the latest theatrical video means for Google’s Nexus to Pixel branding Andromeda: On the software front, it is quite possible that the biggest unveiling will be called Andromeda. Google’s Andromeda OS has been long-rumoured. It is a hybrid of Android and Chrome OS, is expected to be unveiled, finally. With Hiroshi Lockheimer, Senior VP of Android, Google Play and Chrome, tweeting that, “We announced the 1st version of Android 8 years ago today. I have a feeling 8 years from now we’ll be talking about Oct 4, 2016.” it seems to have become even clearer. Also read | As smartphone wars rage on, here’s how iOS 10 fares against Android Nougat 7 Google HOME: Google, according to rumours, has apparently been preparing its own variant of a smart-home device similar to Amazon’s Echo. The product was announced at the I/O in May this year. During the event, one can expect the dates and information regarding the product launch to be announced. According to rumours, the product will be launched at a price of $ 129, which is much lesser than Amazon’s Echo. Chromecast Ultra The Chromecast Ultra priced at $69, is a small streaming dongle with the support of 4K video and HDR. The new update of the CHromecast though costly is understandable with its improved features. Google Wi-Fi Google is reportedly going to release a new router with the option of simple mesh network attributes. Multiple routers being set up at a place, is not a novel idea, yet with new technology it is getting even more simplified, and with Google joining the party, it sure is going to turn some heads. OnHub routers, which was a famous product of Google, though will enter an unknown territory, which Google Wi-Fi launches, along with smart home features. It is expected that the cost will be around the same as that of Google Home. Please Wait while comments are loading...

The 3.5mm to Lightning adapter included in the iPhone 7’s box might be enough for some users that plan to stick with wired headphones, but for many other there’s still the dilemma of charging and listening to music at the same time. We’ve already seen the Fuze case for iPhone 7 that adds a headphone jack to a battery case, as well as a dongle from Belkin that plugs into the Lightning port, offering two additional Lightning ports that can be used at the same time. If you want to use 3.5mm wired headphones with the latter, you’ll end up with this monstrosity: The iLDock is a slightly simpler solution that undercuts both those in price. The small Lightning adapter offers both a headphone jack for traditional headphones and a Lightning port for charging at the same time — and it’s priced at just $10. It’s still in the Kickstarter funding phase, mind you, but after only launching four days ago backers have pledged over $33,000 towards the $5,000 funding goal. If you really want to connect a bunch of stuff to your iPhone 7 at the same time, they’re also offering a iLDock Plus, which, again, plugs into the Lightning port, and offers ports for USB, microSD, SD card, 3.5mm jack, and Lightning. This larger model is priced at $20 during the funding campaign. Both models of the iLDock are made from aluminum, with the smaller version available in iPhone-matching colors including silver, gold, rose gold, and space grey (Apple has retired the latter color from the iPhone, of course, but there’s no Black or Jet Black option for the iLDock). The Kickstarter campaign says they plan to start shipping in November, which may be a bit ambitious since there’s just under four weeks of funding left and manufacturing has yet to start. However, if you’re desperate to be able to charge your iPhone 7 and listen to music at the same time, this is both the simplest and cheapest solution we’ve seen thus far.

Nausika Breau says officially opening Apple Art Gallery with her parents, Dolores Breau and Cecil D. Long, in Moncton this week has been a dream come true. "It actually started as an idea that my mother had that there wasn't enough representation for artists locally in our area," she said. All three members of the family are artists and Nausika said that's where the name for the gallery came from.  "I'm very big into family and because my parents are very big influences in my art world — basically the apple doesn't fall far from the tree," she laughed. "My parents have been in it a lot longer than I have. I think what's great with Apple Art is we're innovating the way a gallery does things." 'We rent art, we lease art' Nausika says Thursday's grand opening "far exceeded" her expectations and she is looking forward to Moncton's annual Art Gallery Tour taking place on Saturday, which Apple Art Gallery is part of. Nausika Breau hopes to make art more accessible and showcase local artists at Apple Art Gallery on Church Street in Moncton. The gallery is part of the annual Art Gallery Tour happening on Saturday. (www.appleart.co) "A lot of people are peeking in and are very curious and I think people are happy that there's another space in Moncton to give a voice for a local artists." Nausika said she has received many submissions and calls from local artists and giving them a platform to exhibit and expose their work to the public is why the gallery is there. She hopes that by renting and leasing art to customers, more local artists will be seen and enjoyed by younger generations who can afford a monthly payment. "It's art that's accessible for everyone," she said. "We rent art, we lease art, we are there for the artist and we just want to encourage local artists and promote them. Give them a voice."

 How iPhone sales correlate with Google search results Jim Edwards Oct. 2, 2016, 7:20 AM 4,118 facebook linkedin twitter email print Enric Fradera/Flickr (CC) Google search trends can be used to predict growth in iPhone sales, and search volume for iPhone 7 suggests Apple is poised for a sales increase, according to two analysts at Longbow Research. Longbow's Shawn Harrison and Frank Carson rate AAPL a "buy" with a $140 price target, based in part on their tracking of Google search interest around the launches of new iPhones. Interest in iPhone 7 is "close" to that showed for iPhone 6 — Apple's biggest ever product launch — they say. That's a contrast to many of their colleagues, who for months have been predicting further declines in iPhone sales because iPhone 7 looked like an unexciting improvement on the existing product that many users might decide to skip until next year. Bernstein is calling for a 5% decline in units sold in the December quarter, and Credit Suisse thinks there may be a decline of up tp 7% for the year. Barclays recently removed Apple from its "top pick" list — where it had been for a year. But they might be wrong, according to the Longbow team: "Google search trends for the iPhone 7 remain well ahead of the iPhone 6s while tracking closer to the iPhone 6 launch. Google iPhone searches are correlated to iPhone shipments (R = 0.79) and predictive of future shipments (R2 = 0.63)." "... We reviewed the period 5 days preceding the new iPhone announcement event and the 11 days post. The iPhone 7 is off to a better start vs. the iPhone 6s and tracking closer to the iPhone 6, but the staying power of demand remains the unknown." Here is what that looks like in a chart. Not shown on the graph is Q4 2016, when iPhone 7 sales will be disclosed. Longbow's prediction is that the black line representing search will shoot skyward the way it did for iPhone 6, and sales for iPhone 7 will match: Longbow Research iPhone 7 had much better search action than even the blockbuster iPhone 6, Longbow says: iPhone 7 vs. iPhone 6s: 5 days leading up to the CY16 announcement, the iPhone 7 averaged 40 search results for every 10 of the iPhone 6s. On the day of the announcement, the iPhone 7 averaged 228 search results for every 10 of the iPhone 6s. 11 days post, the iPhone 7 averaged 36-167 search results for every 10 of the iPhone 6s. iPhone 7 vs. iPhone 6: 5 days leading up to the CY16 announcement date, the iPhone 7 averaged roughly 20 search results for every 10 of the iPhone 6. On the day of the announcement, the iPhone 7 averaged 114 search results for every 10 of the iPhone 6. 11 days post, the iPhone 7 averaged 21-100 search results for every 10 of the iPhone 6. It's interesting stuff but not a slam-dunk case. A UBS analysis of search results recently showed the opposite: That searches indicated declining interest in iPhone 7.

The man smashed a dozen iPhones and a few other devices in retribution for the company’s alleged misconduct.  ( Yorkali | Pixabay ) Advertisement A man in France who had beef with an Apple Store over a "repayment issue" caused massive damages to the company by single-handedly destroying iMacs, MacBooks and iPhones. We've all been there: you walk into an Apple Store, see the myriad of arrogant teens and clueless seniors and you remember that customer support did not agree with you on some matter. What one would do is take a few deep breaths and focus on the bright side of life, or if you are this particular customer in France, grab a heavy object and smash electronic equipment. To ensure that the damage is permanent, the suspect used a "boule," which is a heavy metallic ball used in the traditional French game pétanque. The game resembles bocce or bowls, where players make use of heavy balls to score points. French media reported on the event so several videos of the man's rampage in the Apple Store in Dijon reached the screens. The footage shows the man smashing iPhones and Macs, with damages estimated at tens of thousands of dollars. He took out display products from their stands, arranged them flat on the table and proceeded to pound them with the heavy steel ball that he was carrying. The majority of the destroyed electronics were iPhones, but it seems that he also damaged multiple iMacs and at least one MacBook. We have to thank @quentin_IOS, who was kind enough to tweet the videos of the incident. Business Insider counted the man as bashing 12 iPhones, four iMacs and a MacBook Air. That's about $15,000 worth of damage, at least when taking into account the visible damage. Once he was apprehended, the man went into a fit about his consumer rights. Insiders familiar with the matter said that he claims Apple backed off from the EU requirement that grants a two-year warranty after a product's purchase. During the incident, a siren can be heard in the background, signaling that the employees of the Apple Store triggered the fire alarm so that other customers would leave the shop in order to avoid getting injured. Luckily, the man had beef only with the OEM and no bystanders were hurt. The mall's security staff accosted the man and detained him until the police arrived. The man also made a failed attempt to run away, but he was swiftly caught. If you're an Apple fan and want to test your resolve, check out the video below.

Assembled in China”. Technology giant Apple is expected to eventually push forward that agenda through its recently formed research and development centre at the Zhongguancun Science Park in Beijing, analysts told the South China Morning Post. The existence of this facility was announced by the Zhongguancun Science Park Administrative Authority this week through a post on WeChat, the popular social messaging platform known as Weixin on the mainland. Establishing Apple’s first research and development facility in Asia was one of the strategic new investments in China that chief executive Tim Cook mentioned to vice-premiere Zhang Gaoli at their meeting in Beijing in August. That centre will focus on developing computer hardware and software, audio and video equipment, consumer electronics devices, telecommunications products and other advanced technologies, according to the Zhongguancun Science Park. Apple did not provide a statement. “It makes sense for Apple to create products for China, its second-biggest [geographic] market,” said Kitty Fok, managing director at technology research firm IDC China. Apple’s China market, comprising the mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan, contributed US$8.85 billion in sales to the overall revenue of US$42.46 billion in the company’s third fiscal quarter ended June 25. More importantly, Fok said Apple is burnishing its credentials in the country with another major initiative after its US$1 billion investment Didi Chuxing in May. Apple joined Alibaba Group and Tencent Holdings among the biggest stakeholders in ride-hailing app provider Didi, which serves nearly 300 million users in more than 400 Chinese cities. Alibaba is the owner of the Post. The cost of building Apple’s research and development centre, which will house about 500 staff, will reach US$45 million, a Wall Street Journal report said. Paul Haswell, a partner at international law firm Pinsent Masons, said Apple’s domestic research initiatives could potentially lead to a change in the marketing tag on the back of its future devices. The tag found on the iPhone, iPad, iPod and Mac computers shows “Designed by Apple in California. Made in China.” It makes sense for Apple to create products for China, its second-biggest [geographic] market Kitty Fok, IDC China. “The relationship between Beijing and non-Chinese tech firms has not always been a good one,” Haswell said. “Apple may also see this research and development investment as a way to ensure continued support for the sale of its products in China, despite local competition and the government’s occasional hostility towards Western-developed technology.” “What will be interesting is if the majority of leaks relating to new Apple products would increase in frequency and accuracy when that research and development centre is up and running,” he said. “The leaks about new devices have typically been from people at the Chinese factories assembling those products.” Charlie Dai, a principal analyst at Forrester Research, said the facility “will not only help Apple better leverage local talent, it will also create substantial job opportunities across the country’s capital and contribute to the local GDP [gross domestic product]”. “Overall, it’s an investment that could help increase the trust for Apple’s products and services in the domestic market,” Dai said. He pointed out that most of the global information and communications technology companies were ahead of Apple in setting up a research and development base on the mainland. “This move will help Apple pursue new partnerships with both global and domestic companies in the Chinese market,” he said. Apple has been increasing its efforts in the enterprise market over the past two years, backed by major alliances with the likes of IBM, SAP and Deloitte. “We could potentially see Apple involved in creating customised local solutions for Chinese enterprises, not just consumers,” Dai said. Jin Yi, owner of Jinyi Tech in Shenzhen’s Huaqiangbei electronics district, said interest could be high for Apple’s domestic research efforts. “If Apple focuses on developing smart devices for the mainland market then I will definitely keep an eye on it,” Jin said. In recent launches of the iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch, the Silicon Valley-based Apple has promoted increased support for Chinese apps, including WeChat, Alipay and Weibo.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Sunday, 2 October 2016 | MYT 11:49 AM Five things you didn't know about Apple's new devices (updated) by tan kit hoong Selective zoom: The iPhone 7 Plus does not always use its 56mm lens when you zoom. Update: Apparently the site we originally got the "not sapphire" information from has done a follow up since then and done extensive chemical tests on the iPhone camera lens and it seems it is sapphire, although not as scratch resistant as the sapphire crystal on watches. Here's that original video link and it's follow up video where the lens is chemically tested and then put under an electron microscope. They didn't test the new Home button though.  With the Apple Watch Series 2 and the iPhone 7/7 Plus about to hit our stores, there’s still a lot that we don’t know about Apple’s new devices. However, we’ve done some investigating online and found a few very interesting things. So here’s five things that you probably don’t know about the iPhone 7/7 Plus and Watch Series 2. 1) Warm reset has changed Everybody knows that to turn off the iPhone you have to long press the power button and then swipe the slider that appears. When your iPhone freezes due to a misbehaving app, however, and you can’t even turn it off, you need to do a warm reset, which USED to require holding down the power button and the Home button together until you see the Apple logo appear. However, since the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus now feature a Home button which is essentially driven by software, warm reset in this manner is no longer possible. So how do you warm reset the iPhone 7/7 plus? The new method when your iPhone 7 completely freezes is to hold down the power button and the volume down button until the phone reboots to the Apple logo. Even the aluminium models of the Apple Watch Series 2 have the same scratch-resistant ceramic back as the stainless steel models. (photo is of the original Apple Watch) 2) The aluminium Apple Watch Series 2 has a ceramic back On the first generation Apple Watch, the aluminium models had ion-X glass on the front and a “composite” back which houses the heart rate sensor while the steel models featured scratch-resistant sapphire crystal and ceramic back. We checked and the term “composite” in this case means that the original aluminium Apple Watch heart rate sensor was protected by a hard-coated plastic housing which meant may have been prone to scratches (which could affect the accuracy of the heart rate sensor). However, in the latest aluminium Apple Watch Series 2 models, Apple has quietly made a change to the heart rate sensor’s housing and now all aluminium models feature the same scratch-resistant ceramic back as the steel models. That’s a pretty welcome change, if you ask us. The Lightning to 3.5mm stereo adaptor works with all other third party accessories that plug into the port. 3) The Lightning to 3.5mm stereo adaptor works with other devices that plug into the port While we know that the iPhone 7’s little dongle to allow regular earphones with 3.5mm stereo jacks to work like normal, there was some question as to whether other devices that use the 3.5mm stereo port will work with the adapter. What kind of devices you may ask? Well, there are quite a number of third-party devices that plug into the 3.5mm stereo port of the iPhone, such as credit card readers, infrared blasters, and even light sensors. Well, from what we’ve found out, these devices will continue to work when you plug them into the Lightning port using the adaptor. Good to know. The iPhone 7 Plus sometimes defaults to its 28mm lens when you zoom. 4) The iPhone 7 Plus dual camera doesn’t always use the 56mm lens when you zoom. One of the major features of the iPhone 7 Plus is that it has a second lens which works as a kind of zoom lens when you zoom to 2x. However, did you know that when you use the 2x zoom in low light, the iPhone 7 Plus is most likely just using the regular 28mm lens and doing a crop and resize? Apparently, the 28mm lens’ f/1.8 aperture captures more light and produces better images in low light than the 56mm lens which has an aperture of f/2.8. The reason Apple chooses to do a zoom and crop for a low-light zoom instead of just switching to the 56mm lens is that with more light hitting the sensor at the 28mm end, the ISO doesn’t need to be turned up as high which means that the noise reduction algorithm doesn’t have to work as hard to remove noise (and detail). The long and short of it is that even with the zoom and crop method, the iPhone’s 28mm lens is producing a better image than simply switching to the 56mm lens when you zoom to 2x in low light situations. The Home button and camera lens front element are no longer made of sapphire crystal on the iPhone 7/7 Plus. The Home button seen here from the iPhone 6 is made of sapphire crystal. 5) The Home button and camera lens on the iPhone 7/7 Plus are not sapphire anymore One of the highlights of the iPhone since it introduced the Home button with TouchID is that it was made of scratch resistant sapphire crystal – presumably, to ensure the scratch resistant sapphire Home button would always work better for recognising your fingerprint. Similarly, since the iPhone 5s, Apple has also started using a sapphire crystal front cover lens to ensure the camera’s front element is scratch-free. However, it looks like with the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, Apple has gone back to the regular GorillaGlass option for both the Home button and the camera front element. Who knows why Apple made the change but if you’re buying one, we recommend treating the Home button and camera lens with a bit more care than you would with previous models.

By: Express Web Desk | Updated: October 2, 2016 2:13 pm Mon dieu! This man took Apple-bashing to a whole new level. (Source: Youtube) France might be a country that’s associated more with the emotion of love, but when it comes to anger, it seems Frenchmen are not too far behind. In a video that has recently gone viral, an angry French man walks into an Apple store in the city of Dijon and smashes several new iPhones using a petanque ball. The man caught on camera was wearing dark glasses and carried the steel ball used in the game of boules, methodically removed display phones from their upright holders, and smashed the ball down onto the phones’ Retina HD displays, The Independent reported. The video showed him destroying at least 12 iPhones and a MacBook, before he was caught by security. The incident was filmed by a customer in the shop. When the man noticed that he was being filmed, he addressed the camera to explain why he was destroying the phones. “Apple is a company that violated European consumers’ rights. They refused to reimburse me,” he said. “I told them: ‘Give me my money back’. They said no. So you know what is happening? This is happening!” he shouts, before swinging his steel ball down upon the screen of another iPhone.

Here’s our pick of the best Apple’s latest version of its mobile operating system has a number of useful new features. Photograph: Yui Mok/PA Darien Graham-Smith @DarienGS Sunday 2 October 2016 04.45 EDT Last modified on Sunday 2 October 2016 06.55 EDT Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close 1 Improved touch controls Several buttons now have “3D touch”: they respond to the force used (iPhone 6S or newer devices). A hard press on the timer icon pops up shortcuts to common timer lengths, while the torch icon lets you choose brightness and the camera icon lets you jump to video or selfie mode. Several apps have also gained new touch gestures: in Photos, you can now tap and drag to select multiple images, while the email app now lets you swipe down while composing a message to save it as a draft. To return to a saved draft, hold your finger down on the compose button. 2 Better Apple maps Apple’s map application is getting smarter – it knows when you’re driving and in iOS 10 it automatically drops a pin whenever you leave your vehicle, so you can easily find your way back, even in an unfamiliar neighbourhood. On a smaller scale, the Find my iPhone app can now help you locate a mislaid Apple Watch. You can make it play a loud sound to reveal its location – or put it into “lost mode”, which displays a message of your choosing, so that anyone who finds it can get hold of you. If you fear it has gone for good, you can remotely lock or wipe it. 3 Voice notification of important calls When a call comes in, Siri, Apple’s speech-recognition assistant, can now announce who’s calling, so you know right away whether to pick up. You can enable this at Settings > Phone > Announce Calls. In the interests of privacy, you can choose to use this feature only when using Bluetooth (wireless) headphones or speakers, rather than having all callers’ names read out. You can also now specify individual callers who should always get through, even if your phone’s in “do not disturb” mode (previously you could do this only for groups of contacts). To set this up, open a contact and select Edit > Ringtone or Edit > Text tone, then turn on the Emergency Bypass switch. Facebook Twitter Pinterest iOS 10’s Photos app now groups pictures into people and places. 4 Find people and places in the photo app Open Photos and you’ll see new folders entitled “people” and “places”, grouping pictures according to who is in them and where they were taken. The process of identifying faces is automatic and it happens on your phone (rather than in the cloud) to protect your privacy. To make the most of it, however, you’ll need to tell your iPhone who the people it’s detected are – simply tap on a picture and start entering names to identify your subjects. With this done you can also search for images by person. You can also identify everyday objects: try a search for “car” or “tree”, for example. 5 Inline video in the web browser Before, the Safari web browser for iOS would open videos embedded into web pages in a full-screen view. Now you can watch them in their proper context on the page, just as you would on the desktop. Simply tap to start the video, then tap the resize icon in the bottom-right of the frame (or pinch your fingers together to zoom out). On the iPad Pro, iPad Air 2 or iPad Mini 4, you can also now view two websites side by side: to enable this feature, hold down the new tab button at the top right of the window and you’ll see the option to “open split view”. 6 New Siri features Siri has a few new tricks in iOS 10. “Take a selfie” is one: Siri won’t actually activate the shutter, but he – or she if you’ve chosen the female voice – will open the camera app in selfie mode, ready for your close-up. Siri can also now be used to control third-party apps, such as WhatsApp. To enable this feature, go to Settings > Siri > App Support and enable WhatsApp: you’ll now be able to tell Siri to make calls and send messages. Uber is there too, so Siri can book you a car, and other apps are likely to add support in the near future. 7 iMessage gets a major upgrade iMessage is loaded with new features. There’s a shortcut directly to the camera, so you can easily send photos and selfies, and if you hold down the send button you’ll see a variety of new visual effects: you can send a birthday message surrounded by balloons or a private chat in “invisible ink” that’s only visible when the recipient swipes over it with a finger. If that’s not enough, iMessage now has its own app store, selling sticker packs, games and tools for finding and sharing online information. Just open iMessage and tap the new app store icon next to the message box. 8 Redesigned notifications On the iPhone 6S or newer devices, iOS 10 automatically wakes up the screen to show your notifications as soon as you pick up the phone. What’s more, notifications have become interactive: a hard press lets you reply to an incoming message without having to unlock the phone and open the app. If you’re worried that this feature might be open to abuse, you can disable it by going to Settings > Touch ID & Passcode and turning off “Reply with Message”. You can also dismiss all notifications with a hard press on the close icon; on devices without 3D touch, swipe left on the notification for options. Facebook Twitter Pinterest The Messages app has been redesigned to offer more expression options with the iOS 10 software update. 9 New calendar app features If your phone supports 3D touch, you don’t have to open the calendar app to see what’s coming up: a hard press on its icon will show you your next appointment. Inside the app, you might notice some events that you don’t recall adding; iOS 10 now automatically schedules events detailed in incoming emails or messages. If this results in a deluge of irrelevant events clogging up your calendar, you can turn it off at Settings > Calendar > Events Found in Apps. A final change to the calendar is simple but welcome: you can now reschedule events by simply tapping and dragging them to a new time. 10 Smarter typing suggestions Apple’s QuickType keyboard, introduced in iOS 8, suggests words based on what it thinks you’re typing; iOS 10 goes a step further by analysing the message you’re replying to and suggesting likely responses. If someone sends you an iMessage asking you for a friend’s email address, for example, you’ll see contact details pop up as a suggested response. Another subtle upgrade to the keyboard is the ability to recognise multiple languages without your having to switch them manually – so if you’re trying to impress a colleague with your savoir faire, your iPhone won’t keep trying to “correct” your bons mots. 11 Ways to clear out the clutter It’s frustrating to have your phone cluttered up with apps you don’t need, such as Stocks or the one for the Apple Watch. At last, iOS 10 lets you remove these. Sadly, not much memory space is actually saved – most of the underlying code is built into iOS itself, so removing optional apps only clears around 150MB – but it keeps your home screen much tidier. You can also save a few gigabytes with the iPhone’s “optimise storage” feature, which in iOS 10 can now scan your music library and clear out locally stored tracks that you haven’t listened to for a while. 12 Better connections between devices “Continuity” is Apple’s way of allowing you to put down your work on one device and pick it up on another. iOS 10 adds cross-device clipboard support, so if you want to copy an iMessage into a Word document on your desktop, you can simply hit copy on one device and paste on the other, as long as your Mac is running the latest macOS Sierra release. If you own an Apple TV, you’ll also be pleased to learn that, with the latest version of tvOS, you can now seamlessly switch to your iPhone to enter text – handy for fiddly searches.

Home > News By Company > Brite Smiles Dental Care Tweet   Brite Smiles Educates the Public on Flossing Brite Smiles Dental Care in Apple Valley shares some of the ins and outs of flossing and how it fits into your dental routine.   Flossing   Dr. Dennis Simmons   restorative dentistry (EMAILWIRE.COM, October 02, 2016 ) Apple Valley, MN  Brite Smiles Dental Care (http://www.britesmilesdentalcare.com), in Apple Valley shares some of the ins and outs of flossing and how it fits into your dental routine. Throughout the day, bacteria builds up on your teeth in a sticky film called plaque. Brushing your teeth will remove the plaque. If its left on your teeth undisturbed it will harden into tartar, which can only be removed with special tools by a dental professional. Toothbrush bristles cant always reach into every tiny crevice and thats where flossing comes in. Why We Floss: Flossing removes the food particles and sticky bacteria called plaque from between your teeth and underneath gums that brushing cant reach. Flossing daily prevents plaque from building up under the gums and can prevent puffy, bleeding and irritated gums. Flossing promotes fresher breath, keeps your gums healthy and can help prevent cavities, gingivitis and even heart disease. How Flossing Works: Flossing is important, but so is the technique. When flossing you need to gently slide the floss between the teeth, wrap it around both the back and front of each tooth, gently move the floss down under the gum tissue and move it up and down a few times on each side of the tooth. Your hygienist can review correct flossing technique if you have any questions. They can also show you different flossing aids if you find traditional flossing difficult. When Should You Floss? Experts say it doesnt really matter when you floss. Some people prefer to floss before they brush, some after they brush. Any time of the day that you can fit flossing into your routine is better than not flossing at all. Despite the current controversy about flossing versus not flossing, Brite Smiles Dental Care hygienists strongly recommend flossing. If you have any questions or need any help on the proper technique  please give us a call or ask your hygienist at your next appointment. David A., a recent patient stated Dr. Simmons is kind and compassionate and takes the time to answer all of my concerns. And from Ann R.: Rachel and Dr. Edstrom are the best. Totally comfortable, trust them with any dental procedure or emergency. Dr. Dennis Simmons graduated from the University of Minnesota School of Dentistry in 1976, receiving the Class Honor in prosthetics  dentures partial and full. Since then he has participated in over 3000 hours of continuing education courses, focusing primarily on cosmetic and reconstructive dentistry, dental implants and implant-supported restorations, orthodontics, extractions, crown/bridge, root canals, bite and TMJ disorders and sleep apnea. For his studies, he has been honored with the status of Diplomate from the International Congress of Oral Implantology and the International Osseous (bone) Integration Society.

The Motley Fool Twitter Facebook Email Reddit The Motley Fool Take Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) has released its new iPhone 7 phones, and early reports are that it’s selling well. If these new phones can alleviate the concern among investors about Apple’s ability to grow iPhone-related revenue and unit shipments, that could boost its share price. Add in potential earnings growth, and there’s significant upside to the stock. Despite the iPhone 7’s merits, some see it as just an incremental update to the prior-generation phones, rather than a fundamental game changer. According to whispers, the next iteration, perhaps an iPhone 8, is likely to bring a major overhaul in form as well as a move to a curved organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display, which should both enhance aesthetics and lead to even better image quality. This leap forward could turbocharge upgrade activity and further accelerate market share gains at the high end of the smartphone market. Meanwhile, Apple is generating significant and growing revenue from its services, such as its iTunes Store and App Store. Apple’s future stellar performance isn’t guaranteed, but with a couple of great years potentially ahead in terms of revenue and profit growth, it may be a good time to pick up some Apple stock. It recently traded at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio in the mid-teens, with a dividend that’s growing briskly, recently yielding around 2 percent. (The Motley Fool owns shares of and has recommended Apple.) Ask the Fool Q: Should I invest my kids in stocks or savings bonds? - P.D., Maryville, Tennessee A: It depends. If it’s short-term money needed in a few years for college, then less volatile investments, such as savings bonds or CDs, can give you a modest return and minimize losses. For long-term money, though - meaning time frames of five or 10 or more years - consider stocks, which have outperformed bonds and CDs over most long periods. A simple, inexpensive index fund such as one based on the S&P 500 offers instant diversification across hundreds of companies. You might also invest at least a little money in the stock of a few companies that your children know and like, such as Nike, Starbucks, Hasbro or Apple. Then you can follow the fortunes of the companies together, as they learn about the stock market. Learn more at savingsbonds.gov, bankrate.com and fool.com/investing/mutual-funds/mutual-funds.aspx. Q: What are “closed-end” funds? - S.G., Naples, Florida A: They’re like mutual funds in that they pool investor money that’s managed by a professional - but they’re different. With regular mutual funds, if many people want to invest in them, more shares are simply created. But when closed-end funds are created, a fixed number of shares are sold to the public. After that, the shares are usually traded in a secondary market, like stocks. The prices of regular mutual funds are calculated at the end of each trading day based on the value of the funds’ assets. But the price of closed-end funds can swing higher or lower than their net asset value, reflecting supply and demand of the shares. Closed-end funds can be volatile, and they sometimes charge high fees. Learn more before investing in any. Start at sec.gov/answers/mfclose.htm. My Dumbest Investment Lots of people told me not to do it, but during the housing bubble, I got nervous - and since I didn’t have a pre-payment penalty clause in my mortgage, I decided to use part of my retirement funds to pay off the loan. What made me nervous was that I was getting older, and my income was going to become more limited. I was advised against doing what I did because mortgage interest is deductible on my taxes, and I would have to pay taxes on the amount I withdrew, too. Still, now I can easily live off my limited income and not get any extra gray hair worrying about the mortgage or the possibility of somehow losing my home. And I still have most of my retirement account again. As a single working mother, I have been well served by my investments. I have taken far more out of them than I ever put into them. - D.M., Pittsburg, California The Fool responds: What you did isn’t necessarily dumb. Taking money from a retirement account can be dangerous, as it leaves you with less to support yourself in retirement. But not having a mortgage can be a good thing - and you avoided paying a lot of interest, too. Since your retirement account has recovered some and continues to grow, your financial future is not so imperiled.

Is the case over, or will there be more damages for Apple to pay down the line?  ( Apple ) Advertisement A federal jury in Texas has ordered Apple to pay $302.4 million in damages to VirnetX Holding Corp. over the use of patented internet security technology without permission, included in its FaceTime communications app. VirnetX, based in Nevada, is considered to be what is known in the industry as a patent troll. The company has no products in the market, but it makes money by licensing patents and then filing lawsuits against companies that infringe on them. The patent battle between Apple and VirnetX started in 2010, when the patent troll filed a lawsuit against Apple in Texas for the infringement of four patents. Many cases on patent infringement are handled in courts in Texas, as these courts are known to favor plaintiffs who allege that other companies have infringed on their patents. The amount of $302.4 million that Apple was ordered to pay to VirnetX came from a retrial that had the jury determine how much Apple needs to pay for two patents that were already found to have been infringed, and to determine if the other two patents were also infringed and the damages that will be associated with them. The damages that the jury ordered Apple to pay is lower than what was awarded to VirnetX in 2012, when the jury said Apple owed $368.2 million in damages. The Court of Appeals, however, overturned part of the verdict, citing issues on the instructions that the trial judge gave to the jurors on how to calculate for the damages. The highest amount that the jury awarded to VirnetX was back in February, when Apple was ordered to pay $625.6 million. The amount was one of the highest ever awards ever recorded in a patent case in the United States. However, the judge handling the case, Robert Schroeder, moved for the retrial, stating that the repeated references to the earlier case may have caused confusion among the jurors, leading to an unfair trial for Apple. The case between the two companies, however, is not yet over, as there will be another trial to determine if Apple willfully infringed on the patents. If Apple will be found to have consciously made the infringements, the total amount that Apple will have to pay to VirnetX would increase. In addition to this second trial, Apple will also have to deal with another lawsuit that VirnetX has filed over the newer releases of security features by the company, along with features on the iMessage app. However, for VirnetX to actually receive money from Apple, the case will have to once again go through the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, the specialty of which is patent law.

While the company has offered no official preview, it is expected to unveil a new line of Google-branded smartphones, a tablet and a home virtual assistant. Analysts anticipate that the internet titan will expand on a vision laid out by chief Sundar Pichai at its developers conference early this year. The strategy would seek to take Google’s strength in software and merge that with its devices, as Apple, Amazon and smartphone leader Samsung all work to get a tighter grip on consumers. Google fired off a Twitter message with hashtag #madebygoogle and a video of what appeared to be a long rectangular search term box morphing into a silhouette of a smartphone. “They did call it out as a smartphone event,” Gartner analyst Brian Blau said. “It is an opportunity for Google to show off its latest devices.” Industry trackers anticipate Google will show off its own smartphone, showcasing the prowess of its new Nougat version of its Android mobile software. Google may stamp its latest smartphones with a “Pixel” brand instead of the “Nexus” name it has used in the past for Android smartphones it has made in collaborations with partners. Google has worked with handset makers in the past to field smartphones showing off the full potential of Android mobile operating software, which it makes available free to device makers. By stressing something “made by Google,” the California company has triggered speculation it would push a premium smartphone line of its own against the likes of Apple and Samsung. Apple recently released new iPhone 7 models, along with its new-generation iOS 10 mobile operating system. Samsung meanwhile has been struggling with a recall of 2.5 million Galaxy Note 7 handsets due to complaints of exploding batteries. Taking on Echo The Google gathering is expected to go beyond smartphones, however, with the company possibly showing off a new Chromecast device for streaming online content to television screens, a Wi-Fi router, and perhaps announcing when it will release Google Home virtual assistant. Blau anticipated that Google will build on announcements it made at the developers conference, along with revealing partnerships for apps or services intended to make devices more enticing. At the gathering in May, Google unveiled a virtual home assistant that will challenge Amazon’s Echo and laid out a future rich with artificial intelligence. Google Home, about the size of a stout vase, was to hit the market by the end of this year, but exact timing and pricing was not disclosed. Home devices will incorporate new Google virtual assistant software introduced by Pichai. “Our ability to do conversational understanding is far ahead of what other virtual assistants can do,” Pichai said at the developers conference. “We are an order of magnitude ahead of everyone else.” Home devices combine machine learning, online search, voice recognition and more to allow people to get answers to questions, manage tasks, or control devices by speaking naturally, demonstrations showed. Home will synch with Chromecast devices that allow remote control of televisions or stereo systems, and with “smart” devices made by Google-owned Nest and other companies, company executives promised. Daydreaming Blau also expected the Google event to feature news about Daydream, a virtual reality platform that the company said is coming. That could manifest in the form of a headset into which Daydream-enabled phones serve as screens for virtual reality experiences. “Daydream does go hand-in-hand with the smartphones,” Blau said. Some reports ay the event could include the debut of a seven-inch tablet computer made by Chinese consumer electronics giant Huawei and running on Google software. Andromeda strain As the event neared, speculation mounted that Google might also discuss a long-anticipate merging of its Chrome and Android operating systems, and introduce a new Pixel laptop powered by the software. Google might call the new operating system “Andromeda,” according to some reports. “The new Andromeda OS is expected to bring some of the desktop-like capabilities of Chrome into Android to form a super OS that could work across smartphones, tablets, and notebook-style form factors,” Technalysis Research chief analyst Bob O’Donnell said Such a new desktop style operating system would have the potential to challenge Microsoft Windows and Apple MacOS software for powering computers. “Google has such a smorgasbord of things they could be doing,” Forrester analyst Frank Gillett told AFP. “It doesn’t sound like we will see from them what we need to see on Android, which is to stop the forking.” A longstanding lamentation about Android is that device makers or carriers tend not to update custom versions of the operating systems when improvements or security fixes are released. The splitting of Android software, or “forking,” has created a situation in which one almost needs to toss out old handsets and buy new ones to upgrade operating systems, according to the analyst. “The rate at which Android handsets get updated is abominable,” Gillett said. “It is a market where Android handsets are throw-aways.” Post navigation Previous Previous post: About 90,000 jobs to be filled: Sindh lifts ban on recruitments Next Next post: Will Thar be able to rescue energy-starved Pakistan?

The splitting of Android software — “forking” — has created a situation in which one almost needs to toss out old handsets and buy new ones to upgrade operating systems, according to the analyst. “The rate at which Android handsets get updated is abominable,” Gillett said. “It is a market where Android handsets are throwaways.” Photos Click to enlarge Keywords Apple, computers, Google, Internet, Samsung, Smartphones Business Dollar tops ¥110.50 on U.S. rate hike expectations Nikkei climbs to 10-month high Robot-run Henn na Hotel in Nagasaki enters Guinness book Kerry to Kishida: U.S. has not given up hope on TPP Mail the editor Error Report Republishing Commenting Policy The Japan Times ST The Japan Times on Sunday What's Trending Now Japan’s permanent residency rules may be loosened to lure global talent Fukuoka street reopens a week after massive sinkhole appeared Trump’s lesson: You can lie your way to the very top Trump security adviser sought to reassure Suga on Japan policy: source Hollywood Walk of Fame honors late samurai star Toshiro Mifune A priest’s advice for anti-Trump protesters Work for us Japan government panel halves price of cancer drug Opdivo Record 40% of Japanese sleep less than six hours a day Blogs Japan Pulse Yen for Living BACK TO TOP The Japan Times on Sunday The Japan Times ST Jobs Study in Japan JT for Women JT Bookclub Japanese School Directory Email Updates | Home Delivery RSS Twitter Facebook Newsletter News National World Business Asia Pacific Reference Columns Multimedia Opinion Editorials Commentary Reader Mail Cartoons Life Travel Digital Food & Drink Environment Style & Design Language Lifestyle People Columns Multimedia Community Voices Issues Our Lives Event Listings How-tos Columns Culture Film Music Art Stage Events Festivals Books TV Columns Multimedia Sports Baseball Soccer Basketball Sumo Rugby Figure Skating Tennis More Sports Columns Multimedia About us Contact us Privacy Policy Link Policy Reprints FAQs Support Press Sitemap Advertise The Japan Times LTD.

Phoneys lets you place stickers that look like iMessage chat bubbles with different text in them in the conversation such that it looks to the other person as if they sent that text to you. It's sort of a prank app, which Apple no longer seems comfortable with. After the app shot to the #1 position, the developer got a call from Apple's lawyer, where he was informed that the app was breaking some guidelines by using blue chat bubbles and Apple's San Francisco font, basically emulating the UI. Apple was also not fond of the "prank" nature of the app, although the developer never marketed the app as such. The developer is now given a week to alter the app to fit the guidelines, following which the app will likely be removed if no action is taken by the developer. For his part, the developer was fairly understanding of where Apple was coming from, although Apple is partly at fault here as the app did go through its review process. Perhaps Apple underestimated how popular it would become and is now doing damage control. Either way, if you use this app, it will likely be changed or removed soon.

(AAPL), Twitter Inc (TWTR) and Nike Inc (NKE) Options activity provides a bit of insight on AAPL, TWTR and NKE stock By Joseph Hargett, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Sep 29, 2016, 9:04 am EST     Popular Posts: Monday’s Vital Data: Bank of America Corp (BAC), Facebook Inc (FB) and Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Thursday’s Vital Data: Apple Inc. (AAPL), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) and Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO) 2 Post-Trump Trades for Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO) Earnings Recent Posts: Thursday’s Vital Data: Apple Inc. (AAPL), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) and Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO) Nike Inc (NKE) Stock Can’t Count on a Save From Santa Claus Wednesday’s Vital Data: Facebook Inc (FB), Chevron Corporation (CVX) and United States Steel Corporation (X) View All Posts U.S. stock futures are once again waffling on the Federal Reserve and oil, with stocks set for a negative open later this morning. Another raft of Federal Reserve speakers are on tap today, while investors continue to digest a report from The Wall Street Journal that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) reached an “understanding” for limiting crude production. Finally, economic data today includes weekly jobless claims, second-quarter GDP, August advance trade goods and August pending-home sales data. Plagued by another bout of data brain freeze, futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average have slipped 0.16%, with S&P 500 futures down 0.17% and Nasdaq-100 futures off 0.17%. Wednesday’s options activity bounced back to above average levels, as 15.2 million calls and 13.1 million puts changed hands on the session. On the CBOE, the single-session equity put/call volume ratio ticked higher to 0.65, while the 10-day moving average rose to 0.64. 7 Make-or-Break Earnings Reports Coming in October Driving Wednesday’s options volume, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) was targeted by a rare downgrade from CM Research yesterday, while Twitter Inc’s (NYSE:TWTR) rating was cut by at least two brokerage firms. Elsewhere, Canaccord and Morgan Stanley both cautioned against owning Nike Inc (NYSE:NKE) stock despite the company’s solid quarterly earnings report. Apple Inc. (AAPL) Apple has seen a flurry of upgrades and price-target increases during the past couple of weeks due to strong iPhone 7 preorders. However, CM Research CEO Cyrus Mewawalla sees things quite differently. Mewawalla, who has maintained a “buy” rating on AAPL stock for five years, issues a “sell” rating on Apple yesterday saying “… right now we think there’s a gap between the next big blockbuster product and maturing iPhone sales. That means that there’s more downside than upside at the moment.” Options traders were quick to disagree, as calls accounted for 66% of the more than 932,000 contracts that changed hands on AAPL on Wednesday. Still, Apple was unable to push past resistance at its 50-day moving average on the session — a development that could signal waning buying pressure. As for options traders, this week’s biggest call plays may be a bust if AAPL doesn’t find legs before the close tomorrow. Currently, the weekly September 30 series has significant call buildups at the overhead $114, $115 and $116 strikes, with each sporting OI of more than 15,000 contracts (the $115 strike has more than 28,000 open calls). Look for hedges related to these calls to apply some pressure to any AAPL rally heading into the close tomorrow. Twitter Inc (TWTR) Since the potential for a buyout broke earlier this week, the list of potential Twitter suitors has grown to include Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), Salesforce.com, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). And yet, all remains quiet in terms of actual buyout bids for the social media firm. As a result, both Mizuho Securities (“neutral” to “underperform”) and Loop Capital (“hold” to “sell”) downgraded TWTR stock yesterday, pushing the shares to a 3.2% loss. Speculative options traders were still holding out hope for a deal, however. Total volume for TWTR rose to 462,000 contracts, with calls snapping up 57% of the day’s take. The out-of-the-money $24 and $25 call strikes remain the most popular for the weekly September 30 series, with OI of 15,000 and 12,000 contracts, respectively. However, the more than 21,000 $22 strike puts are beginning to look like smart money as TWTR drifts lower heading into tomorrow’s close. Nike Inc (NKE) Nike’s recent earnings had the makings of a solid quarterly report. Earnings came in at 73 cents per share, topping expectations for 56 cents per share, and revenue grew 8%. But orders through January came up short of year-ago levels, expected to rise only 5% compared to 9% last year. That lack of growth prompted both Canaccord and Morgan Stanley to caution investors about owning NKE shares, saying that it made it unlikely for Nike to hit its currently full-year guidance. Energy Select Sector SPDR (ETF) (XLE): A Buy Signal You Can’t Miss NKE stock fell almost 4% following the commentary, but options traders were not deterred. Total volume came in at nearly 340,000 contracts, with calls accounting for 57% of the day’s take. Still, short-term NKE call traders who snapped up the weekly September 30 series $57.50 strike (all more than 12,000 contracts) may be a bit disappointed, as it would take a considerable rally to push these contracts into the money. There is still hope for the 25,000 October $60 strike calls, however, as NKE appears to be bouncing back a bit this morning — offering a positive sign that knee-jerk selling may have already tapered off. As of this writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

While the company has offered no official preview, it is expected to unveil a new line of Google-branded smartphones, a tablet and a home virtual assistant. Analysts anticipate that the internet titan will expand on a vision laid out by chief Sundar Pichai at its developers conference early this year. The strategy would seek to take Google’s strength in software and merge that with its devices, as Apple, Amazon and smartphone leader Samsung all work to get a tighter grip on consumers. Google fired off a Twitter message with hashtag #madebygoogle and a video of what appeared to be a long rectangular search term box morphing into a silhouette of a smartphone. “They did call it out as a smartphone event,” Gartner analyst Brian Blau said. “It is an opportunity for Google to show off its latest devices.” Industry trackers anticipate Google will show off its own smartphone, showcasing the prowess of its new Nougat version of its Android mobile software. Google may stamp its latest smartphones with a “Pixel” brand instead of the “Nexus” name it has used in the past for Android smartphones it has made in collaborations with partners. Google has worked with handset makers in the past to field smartphones showing off the full potential of Android mobile operating software, which it makes available free to device makers. By stressing something “made by Google,” the California company has triggered speculation it would push a premium smartphone line of its own against the likes of Apple and Samsung. Apple recently released new iPhone 7 models, along with its new-generation iOS 10 mobile operating system. Samsung meanwhile has been struggling with a recall of 2.5 million Galaxy Note 7 handsets due to complaints of exploding batteries. Taking on Echo The Google gathering is expected to go beyond smartphones, however, with the company possibly showing off a new Chromecast device for streaming online content to television screens, a Wi-Fi router, and perhaps announcing when it will release Google Home virtual assistant. Blau anticipated that Google will build on announcements it made at the developers conference, along with revealing partnerships for apps or services intended to make devices more enticing. At the gathering in May, Google unveiled a virtual home assistant that will challenge Amazon’s Echo and laid out a future rich with artificial intelligence. Google Home, about the size of a stout vase, was to hit the market by the end of this year, but exact timing and pricing was not disclosed. Home devices will incorporate new Google virtual assistant software introduced by Pichai. “Our ability to do conversational understanding is far ahead of what other virtual assistants can do,” Pichai said at the developers conference. “We are an order of magnitude ahead of everyone else.” Home devices combine machine learning, online search, voice recognition and more to allow people to get answers to questions, manage tasks, or control devices by speaking naturally, demonstrations showed. Home will synch with Chromecast devices that allow remote control of televisions or stereo systems, and with “smart” devices made by Google-owned Nest and other companies, company executives promised. Daydreaming Blau also expected the Google event to feature news about Daydream, a virtual reality platform that the company said is coming. That could manifest in the form of a headset into which Daydream-enabled phones serve as screens for virtual reality experiences. “Daydream does go hand-in-hand with the smartphones,” Blau said. Some reports say the event could include the debut of a seven-inch tablet computer made by Chinese consumer electronics giant Huawei and running on Google software. Andromeda strain As the event neared, speculation mounted that Google might also discuss a long-anticipate merging of its Chrome and Android operating systems, and introduce a new Pixel laptop powered by the software. Google might call the new operating system “Andromeda,” according to some reports. “The new Andromeda OS is expected to bring some of the desktop-like capabilities of Chrome into Android to form a super OS that could work across smartphones, tablets, and notebook-style form factors,” Technalysis Research chief analyst Bob O’Donnell said  Such a new desktop style operating system would have the potential to challenge Microsoft Windows and Apple MacOS software for powering computers. “Google has such a smorgasbord of things they could be doing,” Forrester analyst Frank Gillett told AFP. “It doesn’t sound like we will see from them what we need to see on Android, which is to stop the forking.” A longstanding lamentation about Android is that device makers or carriers tend not to update custom versions of the operating systems when improvements or security fixes are released.

A longstanding lamentation about Android is that device makers or carriers tend not to update custom versions of the operating systems when improvements or security fixes are released. The splitting of Android software, or "forking," has created a situation in which one almost needs to toss out old handsets and buy new ones to upgrade operating systems, according to the analyst. "The rate at which Android handsets get updated is abominable," Gillett said. "It is a market where Android handsets are throw-aways." - AFP Most Viewed TODAY LAST 7 Days LAST 30 Days Fire breaks out at Pattaya discotheque early Thursday...

VirnetX holds a variety of patents relating to technology used in creating Virtual Private Networks, or VPNs. The company claims that Apple’s own VPN technology, as well as its FaceTime and iMessage services, all infringe on its patents. “Apple hasn’t played fair. They have taken Virnetx’s intellectual property without permission,” VirnetX lawyer Brad Caldwell stated to the jury in Texas today. VirnetX previously won a $368.2 million verdict against Apple, but an appeals court threw out that ruling and ordered a new trial. The company now seeks $532 million due to new generations of Apple products continuing to infringe on its patents. “Apple believes in fairness and protecting intellectual property,” said Apple’s lawyer, Greg Arovas. “VirnetX keeps moving the boundary, asking for more and more and more.” VirnetX has struggled to commercialize its own products and generally relies on licensing agreements for its income, hence why it is so strongly going against Apple. The trial is expected to continue through at least next week and will continue to see arguments from both sides. Apple was not able to make arguments concerning some of VirnetX’s claims as it already addressed them in the initial hearing. The company dropped other arguments, as well. This isn’t the first time Apple has been the target of a patent troll. Last year, it was ordered to pay $532.9 million for infringing on gaming patents of SmartFlash LLC., who then came back again looking for more money, saying some products were released too late to be included in the initial trial. In 2014, Apple spoke out against patent trolls publicly, saying that it is the subject of more patent-related lawsuits than any other company. VirnetX has been successful in the past when it comes to winning patent infringement cases, receiving more than $200 million over recent years. Guides AAPL Company Breaking news from Cupertino.

I completely concur.🙂 LikeLike Doug Aalseth - 10 months ago Reply I like the idea of a 5 year time limit. I’d go a step farther. Make patents non transferable. They only belong to the inventor. Companies could not make a business collecting patent portfolios to use as weapons. LikeLike Richard Du - 10 months ago Patents are set up to drive innovation. If the inventor cannot earn money or at least recruit the money and time spent on developing the invention, then no one will invent anything because people will just copy the idea and make money from it. LikeLike guid guy (@guidguy) - 10 months ago Reply Wrong. The system was set up as a bargain between inventors and society. Society agreed to protect your invention for a limited number of years, but in return disclosing the details of your invention had to be beneficial to society. Trivial and obvious “inventions” are not beneficial to society. The big problem today is that 99% of “inventions” are trivial and obvious to anyone “skilled in the art” and should have never been granted protection in the first place.

Is it something “substantial” such as a particular way to encode and order video packets from one end to the other to allow for proper reconstruction of the video even if the packets arrive out of order due to latencies in the VPN network? Or is it something “trivial” like the idea of end-to-end encryption itself (basically “I talk, I write it in code, I give it to you, you decode” – updated for the digital age. Or do they somehow thing they can patent the *idea of transmitting video at all*? (If so, why haven’t they sued every single live-television anchor-person on Earth?) LikeLike Armand Mascioli - 10 months ago Reply You do not know what a patent troll is if you believe Virnetx is one so please stop using this derogatory reference to this company. Virnetx is a developer of technology for security and holds many of their own developed patents and are experts in the security arena as being proven by Apple’s use of it designs without any alternatives of their own. Therefore, they must pay for its use. LikeLike Submit a Tip cancel Submitting a tip constitutes permission to publish and syndicate. Please view our tips policy or see all contact options.

Newsweek 10/1/2016 Jitender Miglani, Quora Contributor Click to expand Replay Video Trump rode $5 billion in free media to the White House Donald Trump didn't spend nearly as much on advertising as typical presidential candidates, and he didn't have to -- he relied on billions of dollars of free mentions in media ranging from major TV news networks to Buzzfeed and Twitter instead. The real estate magnate got $4.96 billion in free earned media in the year leading up to the presidential election, according to data from tracking firm mediaQuant. Over the past 12 months, the president-elect received more than $800 million in free earned broadcast media, compared to $666 million for Clinton, and $2.6 billion in free earned online news attention, compared to $1.6 billion for his rival. He edged out her and other major political names in American and worldwide newspapers as well.

Read more about the partnership here. Is Alphabet too big? Let me share few numbers to help answer this question. Quotes in the article Apple Inc AAPL ▼ 109.95 -0.04 -0.04% Microsoft Corp MSFT ▲ 60.64 +0.99 +1.66% Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▲ 756.40 +9.91 +1.33% Wal-Mart Stores Inc WMT ▼ 69.19 -2.20 -3.08% 1. Alphabet's 2015 total revenues were $75 billion. Of these, $74.5 billion (99.4 percent of the total) were from Google and the remaining $0.5 billion were non-Google revenues. In terms of profits, non-Google companies had a segment operating loss of -$3.5 billion. 2. If we compare Alphabet to other technology companies in terms of revenues, there are few that are much bigger in size. Apple had $234 billion revenues in FY '15 (fiscal year ending September 2015). Microsoft had $93.5 billion revenues in FY '15 (fiscal year ending June 2015). However, if we look at market valuations, Alphabet is not much far behind Apple and is ahead of Microsoft. So, yes. Alphabet is getting too big in terms of market valuation. Market valuations change every second depending upon the stock price. On Feb. 2, Alphabet market capitalization was more than that of Apple. But, Apple quickly regained the number one spot. On Aug. 1, the top five most valuable companies in the world were technology companies. Alphabet was still holding the second spot. Just under 4 percent of Alphabet revenues in 2015 came from advertising. So, we can say that Google is a technology company that happens to be in the media business, just like Amazon is a technology company that happens to be in the retail business. It makes sense to compare Google with other media companies, just like we would compare Amazon with traditional retail companies such as Walmart.© Pascal Rossignol/Reuters Alphabet shares jumped after reporting strong quarterly earnings, making its combined share classes worth $568 billion, compared with Apple, which had a value of about $535 billion. The top 10 media companies in the U.S. in terms of 2015 revenues are: Comcast Corp., The Walt Disney Co., 21st Century Fox, Time Warner, CBS Corp., Viacom, News Corporation, Discovery Communications, Scripps Networks Interactive and Gannett Co. If we compare Alphabet to other media companies in terms of total revenues, then Alphabet is not only bigger than all of them, but also its revenues are growing much faster than all of them. Most of the media companies generate revenues from several different sources. If we just focus on advertising revenues and compare Alphabet to other media companies in terms of advertising revenues, then Alphabet is "too big". No other company comes closer or has a chance of coming closer. Just see this fact: Google generated $67.3 billion of revenues from advertising in 2015. On the other hand, the combined advertising revenues of U.S. top-10 media companies were $54.7 billion. So, Google generated more advertising revenues in 2015 than the combined advertising revenues of top 10 media companies. and they seem to be growing strong, even at such a large base.

According to a Reuters report filed late on Friday, the verdict was handed down by a federal jury in Texas that has a reputation for awarding favorable verdicts to plaintiffs in cases involving patent infringement. The U.S. district judge presiding over the case, Robert Schroeder, previously threw out VirnetX's $625.6 million win over Apple from a previous trial because he said jurors in that case may have been confused. The case with Nevada-based patent licensor VirnetX originally began in 2010, with a jury eventually awarding the company $368 million in 2012, but that decision was thrown out in 2014 after the court decided there were problems with how the trial judge had instructed jurors on calculating damages. VirnetX continued to pursue Apple in relation to patents it believes the company infringed upon. The previous two suits were combined by the licensor's lawyers, and in February, a jury returned with an even bigger verdict, $625.6 million – one of the highest ever in a U.S. patent case. However, Schroeder later voided the result, saying that the repeated references to the earlier case could have confused jurors and were unfair to Apple. In the latest trial, reports Reuters, jurors were asked to determine damages on two VirnetX patents that Apple had already been found to infringe, and to determine both infringement and damages on another two patents. The final $302.4 million award was in line with what VirnetX had been demanding. Neither Apple nor VirnetX have commented on the latest case, although Cupertino will surely exhaust all avenues for appeals before accepting the result. In the meantime, it is facing another court proceeding over whether it willfully infinged the patents, which could lead to higher damages. Apple is also set to contend with the trial in a second lawsuit filed by VirnetX over newer versions of Apple security features, as well as its iMessage platform.

Surely people are still authoring blu rays. Used to use DVD Studio Pro but that was ages ago. Is there anything out there for Blur Ray? Even better, blu ray 4k UHD... but that might be too good to be true in late 2016.

FCP X and Compressor are able to export Blu Ray compatible files. Roxio Toast 15 Pro is able to create Blu Ray discs albeit very simple discs. Apple wants discs and PCs to go away. It's a mandate internally. Everything they are driving towards is aimed at iOS either on a phone, tablet, watch and perhaps something along the lines of glasses. If Apple drops Mac Pro and possibly MBP (in it's current form) in the next couple of years, I think this will signify they are essentially done servicing the desktop PC industry. I've listened to many of you say it, I've acknowledged it, and now I'm starting to really see the writing on the wall. Perhaps the iMac will get beefed up a bit and that will hold some people over for a little while, but I think things are changing incredibly fast and Apple is more than happy to see "archaic" computer technology go by the wayside. Who fills this eventual gap, who knows. Perhaps how we work will change. But in the meantime, we need to deal with 8K video and heavy lifting is still required for many aspects of our industry, so not sure this will all time out well for any of us living in the Apple universe. But I have been wrong on many things. So, back to the topic at hand. If you need professional Blu Ray, I would have it done professionally. If you need to make Blu ray screeners, it's still possible on the Mac but your options are limited.

I think you have to admit, there aren't many situations where you even want to utilize disks anymore. It is kind of clunky technology.

Especially since BR isn't all the hi rez. The thing with discs is that they were a standard, especially when you had them made professionally. USB Thumbdrives are a bit all over the place, and depending on what codecs you use, where it will be played from, etc all can factor into viewability. Having said that, I use them all of the time, and one of my favorite tricks is to use a Roku and a USB thumbdrive when I go to show clients a video or when I need to do a screening. So, I'm less stuck on the disc thing and more so on the future of content creation on the Mac. I'm okay with change. I have three projects being cut in FCPX at the moment, I just want Apple to acknowledge that a product like FCPX needs the hardware backbone to keep up with new video technology. I haven't had much luck cutting 8K on an iPhone yet. Three years between pro level system is too long. And for all we know, the nMP may never be updated. But if they are intending on moving forward with it, I think we will need to hear something soon. At least a roadmap for where their professional development is heading.

Bickerstaff View Profile View Forum Posts Private Message Senior Member Join Date Apr 2007 Posts 1,547 10-01-2016, 06:54 PM Apple doesn't want desktop computers to go away, a lack of a Mac Pro update is hardly evidence of that and considering the amount of money you'd spend picking up a 12 core Mac Pro with maxed out ram and disc space is an update timeline 3 years + really that crazy? Supposedly there is a big update coming for the MacBook pro this month so the Mac isn't going anywhere. No one is expecting you to cut 8k on your phone. Though I do think Apple need to come out with a Blu-ray/UHD/DVD authoring app again, they could just update their external super drive to be an UHD Blu-ray burner. Putting all that work into something only to stick it on a thumb drive as an mp4 file or whatever doesn't feel right when I could offer something with a proper menu and some effort put into the packaging. You shouldn't have to spend $50k+ or however much those damn programs cost to develop a disc. http://www.twitter.com/craig_wb     Page 1 of 2 12 Last Jump to page: Quick Navigation Off Topic Top Site Areas Settings Private Messages Subscriptions Who's Online Search Forums Forums Home Forums Red Digital Cinema Recon NAB 2016 DRAGON WEAPON RAVEN RED DISCUSSION Crucial Ordnance EPIC-M OWNERS The DSMC System EPIC RED ONE SCARLET REDLINK DEVELOPERS .

Thanks to Steve Jobs, co-founder of Apple Inc., students have this technology. Unfortunately, Jobs, 56, passed away Wednesday, Oct. 5, due to a rare form of pancreatic cancer. Anything with an “i” before it is Jobs’ doing. Jobs, who dropped out of college after only attending Reed College for six months, started Apple Inc. at an early age and created a totally new culture of technology, including the Mac, iPod, iTunes, iPhone, iTouch, iPad and iPhone. Students and faculty rely heavily on Apple products, especially Macs, for their majors and classes. Associate professor of art Theresa Harris, who teaches graphic design and typography, has been using Macs for a long time and believes they are necessary for her classes. “[Apple] is the industry’s standard,” Harris said. “It’s what over 95 percent of the graphic design industry and design field use as well as fields in video and animation. Everybody is an Apple fan. Jobs’ influence on the graphic design industry cannot be understated. He totally revolutionized the field.” Graphic design major Khalid Spry agrees with Harris when it comes to using Macs for his major. “His products will help me launch my business designing clothing.” As Harris said before, Apple products have been being used for the field of video and animation as well. Jobs was also the owner of the animated film company Pixar. Theatre & Cinema major Carlos Gomez works with Macs all the time for his major and says it’s essential that students can be able to use the technology at Western. “At Western, the Mac labs have been absolutely necessary for our cinema and digital animations majors, which seem to be expanding with the current entertainment industry,” he said. “Mac or PC?” has been a very popular question that has been asked in past years, and Gomez explains why Macs works better for his major. “Apple has the rights to use more powerful software in their computers,” Gomez said. “Apple has the rights to the big filmmaking software, like Final Cut Pro. Although software, like Adobe’s Premiere, is both for a PC and Mac, it was first created for Mac, so the brand trust is with Apple.” Macs have helped a lot of other majors, like journalism for laying out newspaper and yearbook pages, but Apple technology has also changed this generation as a whole. “[Jobs] connects with this generation in terms of music and the visuals and animation in the movies,” Harris said. “It’s a beautiful thing: The way he has this marriage between design and technology, and it just comes together in a wonderful package that is efficient and functions well. He made using technology an experience and made us all want to be a part of that culture.” Even though Jobs has passed away, Spry believes he will not be forgotten. “Steve Jobs will live on as long as you see the Apple mark.” This entry was posted in Features, Lifestyles and tagged death, Ipad, iPod, Legacy, Steve Jobs.

Dela Cruz, UniversityHerald Reporter iPad Air 3 and iPhone 8 Will Hit the Shelves in 2017 with Intel Kaby Lake MacBook Pro? [RUMORS] Apple Unveils New iPad Models (Photo : Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) Year 2017 marks the 10th anniversary of Apple for its iPhone models and MacBook Pro. The tech giant is expected to launch the upgrades of Apple products such as iPad Air 3, iPad Pro, iPhone 8 and the long rumored MacBook Pro with Intel Kaby Lake processor. MacBook Pro (Kaby Lake) Apple is expected to launch a MacBook Pro by the end of October 2016 however the said laptop will be powered by Skylake processor and not with the Kaby Lake, Mac Rumors reported. As Kaby Lake will be released in 2017, Apple is believed to come up with another MacBook Pro within next year bearing the latest Intel chipset. iPad Air 3 (iPad Pro 2) Apple has been rumored to have killed off the iPad Air brand and replaced it with the new iPad Pro 2 instead. It was two years ago when iPad Air 2 was released to the public followed by the launching of an iPad Pro 9.7-inch model back in March 2016, PC Advisor reported. Now, the question that lingers: Is the iPad Pro 2 the new iPad Air 3? Nevertheless, iPad Air 3 (iPad Pro 2) is rumored to be slimmer, thinner and lighter than the 6.1mm iPad Air 2 and 7.5mm iPad Air. Apple is also expected to wrap the new iPad Air 3 with aluminum that will come in four color variants - Gold, Silver, Space Grey and Rose Gold. iPhone 8 iPhone 8 could not be the final name for the next generation iPhone. As revealed by the staff of Apple plant in Israel, the tech giant company may not continue the naming tradition for iPhone and the 2017 iPhone might be called iPhone X. The presumed iPhone 8 is said to become nostalgic as it is believed to be similar with the physical design of the old iPhone 4 according to Mashable where it feature a glass and metal design. The new iPhone is expected to be released during the celebration of the smartphones 10th anniversary come 2017.

The iPhone maker has been found guilty of using VirnetX’s internet security technology in features like FaceTime. The verdict is a let-down for Apple for a case that has been going on since 2010. At first the jury ruled that Apple owed more than $600m to VirnetX, but in August 2016 an appeals court threw the ruling out, saying jurors may have been confused. The latest verdict was handed out by the Eastern District of Texas court, which has gained a reputation for favouring plaintiffs that allege infringement in patent cases, reports say. Both Apple and VirnetX have not issued any statement post the order but Bloomberg reports that Apple is likely to face another round of court proceedings. The court will try to determine whether Apple wilfully infringed the patents and if found guilty, the company could face much higher damages. VirnetX has also filed another patent infringement case against Apple over other security features that include the iMessage application. VirnetX was founded by former employees of government contractor SAIC Inc, and most of its developed technology stems from work done for the CIA for developing secure communications. In fact, the company has been unsuccessful in marketing its own software and mostly relies on patent licensing for revenue. It has only about 20 employees, both part-time and full-time, and got its last payout from Microsoft Corp amounting to $23m. – IBTimes Related Posts #ZumaMustFall dominates SA ‘social conversation’ Durban – President Jacob Zuma’s removal of Nhlanhla Nene as minister of finance dominated social media this past week, with #ZumaMustFall making up for 72% of the country's “social conversation”, ...

Anytime. Anywhere. NEWS OPS By Mae Anderson. Updated October 1, 2016 11:43AM SHARE ALSO SEE Nintendo Pokemon Go Mobile Gaming Mobile Apps Niantic Activision Does "Pokemon Go" have a second act?The mobile phone app was an instant hit when it debuted in July. Crowds stampeded after a Vaporeon in Central Park and people fell off cliffs playing it in California. At an Apple event on Sept. 7, Niantic CEO John Hanke said 500 million people had downloaded the game in just two months. It was the first mobile game to go mainstream in a big way since "Candy Crush" in 2014 or "Angry Birds" in 2012. It was also the first to incorporate augmented reality, a blending of the real and virtual worlds. But the buzz has decidedly cooled. Last Tuesday, the game ended its reign as the top-grossing U.S. iPhone app after 74 days on top, replaced by "Clash Royale," a popular battling game, according to research firm Sensor Tower. Twitter mentions of the game peaked at 1.7 million on July 11, five days after its launch, according to Adobe Digital Insights. That number had fallen by 98 percent, to 131,000, by Sept. 7, when Apple featured it. Was it all a summer fever dream? While experts say the game is likely to remain popular for a while, it needs to evolve to have real staying power -- just like its namesake digital creatures. "Almost anything of this sort is a fad," says Steve Jones, a communications professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago. "I think we've seen the tapering off." Down But Not Out Of course, an enormous number of people still play the game. Research firm App Annie estimates 1 in 10 smartphone owners in the U.S. are playing; in Japan, that number is 1 in 4. Those U.S. figures are half what App Annie saw the week after the game launched -- but to put them in perspective, they still reflect roughly the same user interest as Twitter or Pinterest. "Pokemon Go" has also been good at keeping people playing after signing up. Its 30-day retention rate is the second best on the Google Play store -- behind "Words with Friends," but ahead of other popular games such as "Clash of Clans" and "Clash Royale." "For a gaming app to be as big as a social network is unprecedented," said Fabien-Pierre Nicolas, a spokesman at App Annie. "Right now, yes, they're losing a million players every week. But they get a million new players every week." The longer users interact with the game, the more time a company has to figure out how to get money from them, Nicolas said. It took a year for some successful games like "Clash of Clans," ''Puzzle" and "Dragon" to earn revenue of $1 billion, but "Pokemon Go" has already made more than $500 million in revenue in two months alone, according to App Annie. The game is free, but lets users purchase items in the game. "Pokemon Go" Evolution But with social chatter dying down and a new smartphone game based on a beloved 1990s character -- "Super Mario Run" -- hitting app stores in December, Pokemon will have to reinvent itself. Kari Amarosso, a public relations manager at Arizona State University, started playing "Pokemon Go" with her 19-year-old son as a fun mother-son summer activity sparked by 1990s Pokemon-card nostalgia. They'd go to the mall or to meetups like one in Tempe, Arizona, where thousands of people walked around Tempe Town Lake capturing digital monsters. But the allure wore off after about six weeks, she said. "I lost interest or just plain forgot to play," she says -- and her son has stopped as well. "His route doesn't change much from work, to home, and he lost interest," she says. Niantic has been trying to freshen things up. In September it introduced a "buddy" system, allowing users to pair up with a Pokemon to scoop up game currency called "candy." It has also debuted an Apple Watch app and introduced a $35 wearable device, Pokemon Go Plus, which lights up and vibrates when you're near a Pokestop or a newly appeared Pokemon. Niantic did not respond to a request for comment. Hasn't Caught Them All Jones suggests the company needs to do more to keep people interested -- for example, by adding some kind of social element so that players can interact with each other. His two teenage sons, he notes, have grown slightly less enchanted with the game. "Young people are used to doing social media and there isn't really messaging as part of the game," Jones said. There have been persistent rumors that Niantic plans to let players trade captured Pokemon with one another, although the company hasn't commented on that. The big challenge for "Pokemon Go" is to avoid the fate of "Candy Crush," says Pace University marketing professor Larry Chiagouris. Created by King Digital, "Candy Crush" because a smash hit; Activision Blizzard subsequently bought King for $5.9 billion. But while people still play the game, the fervor around it has died down. When the game was at its peak, "you were getting invited to play Candy Crush every day" on Facebook, he said. "You don't get too many invitations to play Candy Crush anymore." © 2016 Associated Press syndicated under contract with NewsEdge. All rights reserved.

Just think about how your life would change in a jiffy! It sounds pretty cool, huh? If you were reading my other “hacking related” articles like this one, you might think that, oh well, maybe I’ll give it a try, I could use 1.5 million bucks around the house. Maybe I’ll fix the roof, maybe I’ll relocate to Hawaii, you know what I mean? But the weird thing is that the respective bounty is not offered by Apple. Thing is, today’s news is a true shocker for the Cupertino based company, as the hefty reward comes from Zerodium, which is  something between a black hat and a white hat organization, a shade of gray if you like. Basically, these guys are offering a huge amount of cash for an iOS 10 Zero Day exploit,  a sum which is 7 times more than Apple themselves are putting on the table. Indeed, Apple too thought about using this clever trick, i.e. to motivate the hackers out there, the free market sort to speak, in order to improve their iOS 10 security, just like Google was doing for quite some time now. Zerodium is actually a start-up company, the brain-child of the infamous French based Vupen, and these guys are very smart in this writer’s opinion. Their modus operandi is to buy exploits and things of that nature from “wild hackers” and then to sell them to governments and companies and then again, to who knows whom (for more dough obviously)? Zerodium offered half a mil in the past for an iOS 9 zero-day exploit, but now they upped the ante three fold for iOS 10. To get the $1.5 million, you’ll have to deliver a previously unknown Zero Day Exploit for iOS 10, as in a remote jailbreak which allows a 3rd party full control over the respective device. The same story goes for a remote jailbreak over an Android 7 Nougat running device, but the bounty is just $200,000.

The scene, captured on camera and posted on the internet, has gone viral in France. In it, the man walks into the store in a shopping mall in Dijon, central-eastern France, and pounds the screens of Apple products with a heavy fist-sized metal ball used in petanque, a French bowling game.

As he walked out of the store, a security guard intervened. Prosecutor Marie-Christine Tarrare said he caused €55,000 in damages.

Apple, with its huge pile of cash, is hiding behind the rule that taxation takes place where value is created. It makes it exceedingly difficult for authorities to work out how much value is created in which country. October 01, 2016, 9:29 pm/ 5 Comments SHARE : Waqas Shabbir Tweet The European commission’s ruling about Apple has once again highlighted the greed culture and inappropriate behavior of global corporate giants like Google, Starbucks, General Motors & Amazon – especially, when it comes to paying taxes. The history of Apple’s irresponsible behavior, recklessness & greed seriously questions the company’s CSR initiatives. Apple is known to exploit small mines: 70% of the tin used in Apple products comes from illegal mines. Middlemen use the small mine operators & workers who partake in delivering the product to Apple are still living in appalling conditions & are deprived of minimum wage. With a surge in suicide cases at Apple’s manufacturing plants, the appalling conditions and plight of the workers was an open secret which led to worldwide condemnation of Apple’s greed and immoral behavior. Though, Apple had defended itself by arguing that it is doing more than other businesses to ensure the safety of its workers but the reality looks the opposite. What about the workers at Apple’s manufacturing plants, do they have the choice to avoid such poor work life balance, where they work relentlessly to meet their life’s demands? With so much talk on China’s transition from a growth-based economy to a quality-based one, how long will these catastrophic work practices be allowed? Nobody is demanding for a six hour work day like Sweden, where such a model failed to bring dividends, but some respite for workers is needed. In a country where Panama leaks failed to avert the minds of the voters & accountability institutions failed to be jerked into starting an investigation into the corrupt elite, can such scandal really change the minds of buyers about a tax thief & manipulator like Apple, which has blatantly used its advantageous position to forge a deal with the Irish? For a very long time, Apple had been a beneficiary of the lose tax policies of the Republic of Ireland. It struck an extraordinary deal with Ireland, which helped the company avoid tax bills on sales in most of the global markets. Apple has been penalized for its aggressive corporate tax avoidance. Ironically, the tech giant had been legally evading taxes. It was concluded by the fact finding committee in to Apple’s tax irregularities that such tax related privileges & arrangements were specifically designed to facilitate the company. Some extraordinary arrangements were made using the rulings of 1991 & 2007, entailing the allocation of profits to Apple’s Head Office situated in Cork but, with no premises or staff. The head office exists only on paper & all the profits from Europe, India, Middle East and Africa were recorded in Ireland with no staff. One of the most astonishing revelations made regarding this scandal, was that in the financial year (FY) 2011, one of Apple’s subsidiaries, “Apple Sales International”, recorded 16bn Euros in profit & Apple paid a mindboggling 10 million Euros, which was only 0.05% of the profits. Isn’t it unrealistic? This special arrangement allowed Apple to conceal its actual position & gave a significant unfair advantage to the company against other companies operating in Europe. Other than the poor workers working long shifts to feed the ever growing demand for Apple’s products, continents and countries are also victims of Apple’s greed. In an open letter, Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO, reaffirmed that Apple is committed to serve communities around the world – wherever it operates – and plays a crucial part in lifting the local economies through investment & employment opportunities. He was quite stern in his response, declaring that Apple pays & will continue to pay a bulk of taxes only where value is created. Does that mean that in areas other than Cork & California, where it sells its products, Apple will not pay taxes? Some questions remain to be answered by the authorities in Brussels: Why did Apple never pay the taxes in the countries where it earned the profits? Why was Apple allowed to take illegal state aid in Europe under the noses of the European Commission for so long? It is time for stern actions to be taken against those who make a mockery of the system and play and use the peculiar tax rules. The culprits in such a setup are not limited to the companies in question, but it also includes the financial advisers & countries which benefit from these handful of companies, by bending the rules to benefit a select few at the cost of common tax payers. Apple, with its huge pile of cash, is hiding behind the rule that taxation takes place where value is created. It makes it exceedingly difficult for authorities to work out how much value is created in which country. It works in favor of culprits like Apple who act like true capitalists: it maintains huge margins on its products, but fails miserably to share the cherry with rest of the world. Tim Cook’s response via a letter laments the authorities at the helm in Brussels. His letter also makes it clear the Apple workers working in mines in Indonesia are not value creators. A worker working in China at its manufacturing plant is also not a value creator. And those suffering after being exposed to hazardous substances in Chinese factories are not value creators, at all! What really matters is how conscious today’s consumer is about the business practices of products he or she uses. How many of Apple’s potential consumers will give the new iPhone 7 a miss, after learning about the company’s unethical practices? Is it possible for consumers to behave more prudently and value the ethical & moral behavior of the seller more than the satisfaction derived from the use of its products? It totally depends on people’s attitude towards morality and goodness. Would you really want to possess a product of a company which values hoarding big sums of money supposedly to be used partly for value creation, and shows reluctance to spend on those who create value for it? When those who played a key role in value creation are deprived of their share, how on earth could one expect Apple to show any respect towards the outsiders? Karl Marx was not wrong, when he argued, that the “contradictions of a market based on other nexus between man and man than naked self-interest, than callous ‘cash payment’, a system of exploitation and of endless accumulation can never be overcome; that at some point in a series of transformations and restructuring the development of this essentially destabilizing system will lead to a state of affairs that can no longer be described as capitalism."

Friday November 18, 2016 US WORLD PERSECUTION MINISTRY CULTURE VIDEO Subscriptions Homepage WORLD iPad Air 3 release date, specs rumors: New and much-improved specs to be featured in the new iPad Air iteration Arvin Donguines 01 October, 2016 11:55 AM Like Us Share on Facebook Share on Twitter (Apple website)The iPad Air 2. As of this writing date, Apple remains tight-lipped whether or not they will indeed be releasing the next generation of its iPad Air tablet line, the Apple iPad Air 3. Rumors that were picked up recently indicate that the Cupertino-based tech giant might have already scrapped the entire tech series to put more focus in developing the purported new iterations of the iPad Pro tablet line, which is slated to be rolled out with a "revolutionary" OLED display by as early as 2018, Mac Rumors wrote. The latter device is further believed to come along with high-end hardware and features aside from its 9.7-inch screen. In the case of the iPad Air 3 being shelved, the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus maker is yet to confirm but the speculations are rife pointing out to the possibility that it will eventually hit the market as a low to mid-end alternative, according to a report. With its release date, there's still no substantial information that can pinpoint the exact date. Although, the latest rumblings indicate that it could find its way to the street by the first quarter of 2017, probably no later than April, if this is the case. The reported specs of the iPad Air 3 could definitely be a reason for consumers to cross their fingers and wait for the upcoming device. A roundup of details from a particular publication said that the tablet will be made available with an Apple pencil connectivity. If this turns out to be true, then it will come in the ranks of the 12.9-inch iPad Pro which is currently the only iPad that can be used with the said proprietary pointing and writing device. Speaking about its dimensions, the iPad Air 3 might be displayed in the Apple Stores with a much thinner body than its direct predecessor, the iPad Air 2, which is 6.1 mm thick. Under the hood, the new gadget is expected to sport Apple's latest chipset, the A10. Watch out for more updates.

Thanks to services like Apple Music, Spotify, iTunes and YouTube, the ability to listen to music from across the world has never been more affordable or accessible. But with so many avenues to listen to music, accessing your favorite songs and playlists across varying services can often be an exercise in frustration. When Apple Music first debuted, for example, many people were eager to see what Apple’s take on music streaming was like. One downside, though, is that users who had previously built-up playlists on sites like Spotify had no way to export them to Apple Music. At long last, there’s now a new iOS app that promises to solve this admittedly first-world problem. DON’T MISS: Yup, now the iPhone 7 is exploding Dubbed 25 Most Played, the app is rather simple but extremely helpful. In short, it lets users “import, share, find, follow and port” playlists across Spotify, YouTube, Apple Music and iTunes. In other words, if you’ve got an extensive number of carefully constructed playlists on iTunes from back in the day, 25 Most Played promises to make it a breeze to import it into any music service of your choosing. The app description reads in part: 25 Most Played is a free music app for finding, managing, and following music playlists for iTunes and Apple Music, Spotify, and YouTube. Import your playlists from one service and play them on another. And if you are moving to a new music streaming service, 25 Most Played can port your playlists for you. … 25 Most Played allows you to follow playlists created by your friends on other streaming services and listen to them on the music streaming service you use – even with the videos on YouTube. Import your playlists so you can play them at parties even if the host doesn’t use the same platform as you. Find playlists created by your friends, by people in your city, or by strangers with good music taste and save them to your home screen so they are easy to find and play via the music streaming service you prefer. Will Apple eventually remove the app? It's hard to say but it certainly wouldn’t surprise us. Which is to say, if you’re at all protective and serious about your musical playlists, you might want to try downloading this app (accessible via the source link below) as soon possible.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Oct 1, 2016 at 11:22AM Image source: Apple.  Although the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone 7 series smartphones only recently launched, credible rumors surrounding the iDevice maker's next-generation iPhone -- which many expect to be called the iPhone 8 -- are already circulating. The latest set of rumors comes from the generally reliable (and always interesting) Ming-Chi Kuo with KGI Securities (via AppleInsider). There's some interesting stuff here, so let's see what he has to say. Glass bodies with metal frames Kuo expects that next year's iPhones will feature glass backs with metal frames, as phones with all-glass chassis aren't currently feasible "given technological bottlenecks." The analyst expects that Apple's more mainstream smartphones will feature aluminum frames while more premium models may be differentiated by the use of more expensive -- though, according to the analyst, more aesthetically pleasing -- stainless steel frames. Kuo says one of the key reasons Apple wants to move to glass is that producing the glossy finish that's currently used in the popular jet-black variants of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus is difficult. He cites manufacturing yields of between 60% and 70%. He also points out that a glass back will allow for "better scratch resistance," something that he claims will "improve user satisfaction." A couple of business takeaways It's quite interesting that Apple appears to be planning to more aggressively segment its product portfolio. This is hardly a new practice in the world of consumer electronics, but such segmentation actions are relatively new to Apple's iPhone business. I suspect that there are a couple of key business realities driving Apple to be more aggressive on this front. First, Apple simply has far more resources to invest today than it did during the early innings of the iPhone. Indeed, Apple's research-and-development spending has soared over the past decade (see the chart below), as the company's successes with the iPod, iPhone, iPad, and the Mac have allowed it to invest substantially more into the development of future products.  AAPL Research and Development Expense (TTM) data by YCharts Building and ramping up into producing multiple variants of a product is no trivial task. However, the company's research and development budget is roughly an order of magnitude greater than it was back in 2007. Indeed, Apple's product development budget is up more than a factor of three from where it was just four short years ago. Next, the smartphone market itself is no longer growing at the high rates that it had previously. That means Apple can't rely on the rising industry tide to lift its iPhone business. It needs to be aggressive about building and offering a broader and deeper portfolio of products to service as many potential customers as possible. The reality is that the look and feel of a smartphone is an important selling point, and it's likely that the iDevice maker will be able to get a significant portion of its customers to pay more for a more "premium" looking design. The glass-backed model with an aluminum frame should be a premium design in its own right, but I'd imagine that there are customers that would choose to buy higher-end iPhones (for example, phones with larger on-board storage) simply for the even more premium look and feel of an iPhone with a stainless steel frame.  And finally, at some point it simply becomes hard to gain further market share and grow unit shipments, even with a broader portfolio of products. This means that Apple is going to sell a richer mix of products. Apple has historically differentiated iPhones by storage tiers and, recently, by size (the iPhones with 5.5-inch displays command a significant premium to the ones with 4.7-inch displays).  With increasing differentiation of higher end models (through both look and feel, as well as potentially technical specifications), Apple could very well drive a significant boost in iPhone average selling prices. It would seem that Apple's executive team is keenly aware of these business realities and, as a result, is changing up its product development strategy in a bid to capture as much of the revenue and profit dollars in the industry as possible. It's a good strategy, and as we see it really play out over the next couple of years, Apple's shareholders should be handsomely rewarded in the form of a return to iPhone unit growth and richer average selling prices.

The case will now go to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, DC. Virnetx is a communications technology company founded by a group of employees at the Science Applications International Corp. (SAIC) which developed security technology for various federal agencies. However, the company is regularly described as a patent troll, making most of its revenue through licensing the patents that it holds. The company has instigated lawsuits against Microsoft and Cisco. This is the third trial between the two companies This is the third time that Apple and VirnetX have gone to court over this issue. In 2010, VirnetX sued Apple, alleging that it had infringed on four patents. While the court ordered that Apple pay $368.2 million to VirnetX’s, the suit was thrown out by the US Court of Appeals. A second trial earlier this year resulted in another win for VirnetX, but a trial judge overturned the $625.6 million fine for Apple in July. VirnetX won’t see this payout right away. The case will now go to the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, DC, according to Bloomberg. The court has a long history of ruling on patent cases, and will examine the case according to two standards to determine whether or not Apple infringed on the patents: the one used by the US Patent and Trademark Office, as well as the one used by the District Court in Texas. The court will need to find that Apple has violated both standards in order to award the fine to VirnetX.

As noted by our cover graphic, the Imperial Ballroom was packed to hear Tim Cook speaking. Desert News Utah reported late yesterday that "To many in the tech world, getting a glimpse of Apple's CEO is akin to music fans seeing their favorite rock star. To millions around the world, Apple CEO Tim Cook is the rock star of tech — the living embodiment of success and innovation."   Considering that Apple has 50,000 registered iOS developers in Utah it was no wonder why the crowd was so enthusiastic to hear Cook talk. One of the topics Cook delved into was privacy.   Cook talked up the promise of the emerging field of augmented reality, underscored digital photo technology's importance to personal memories and described lasting impacts on Apple from its legendary Apple founder Steve Jobs.   On a personal note, Cook said that 'I never thought it possible.' But he received the 'call of a lifetime' from founder Steve Jobs in early 1998. 'Five minutes into the discussion with him, I wanted to throw caution to the wind and join Apple,' Cook said. 'And it was the best decision I ever made.'"   When asked about the future of encryption as it relates to maintaining privacy of digital communication, Cook said his company is dedicated to keeping their customers' information as safe as possible from hackers and also from government intrusion.   "This is one of the biggest issues that we face," Cook said. "Encryption is one of the things that makes the public safe. We believe the only way to protect both your privacy and safety from a cyberattack is to encrypt."   Most of what Cook spoke about has been covered a million times before, but if you want to read up on it all, then check out the reports from Desert News Utah and The Salt Lake Tribune.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Powers Finds Apple Music Customers Have Highest Customer Satisfaction Bryan Chaffin @TMOBryan · +Bryan Chaffin Oct 1st, 2016 8:30 AM EST | Analysis J.D. Powers found that Apple Music customers have the highest customer satisfaction ratings amongst streaming music services. In a report authored by Kirk Parsons, the firm attributed those results, in part, to the strength of Apple’s ecosystem. Apple Music Extends the Ecosystem Apple makes money from its services. Growth in services revenue was a bright spot in two most recent and otherwise lackluster quarters. But Apple CEO Tim Cook and his executive team have made it clear that services support the ecosystem and the hardware. Source: J.D. Powers The J.D. Powers report suggests this strategy is working, and that the ecosystem makes Apple Music Customers more satisfied. It also makes them more satisfied with the ecosystem. It’s an ouroboros of happy, paying customers. “Apple Music has the highest incidence of customers who say they selected their provider because it is part of their device ecosystem, and the brand’s phone and tablet customers have the highest levels of commitment,” the report argued. “Apple Music customers have the highest incidence of saying they ‘strongly agree’ that they are committed to their streaming provider (35%), and this incidence is highest by a considerable margin.” This expertly highlights what J.D. Powers characterized as Apple’s “advantage” in offering a whole widget model married to a curated, walled garden. No other company on the planet can touch that advantage. That upstart Apple Music beat every pre-existing streaming service in satisfaction ratings is the proof in that pudding. It should also give those who doubted (or continue to doubt) the wisdom of Apple’s purchase of Beats. Apple Music is clearly well positioned to help Apple sell more devices. These satisfaction numbers are meaningful. Paying Customers are Happier A non Apple-specific aside: one of the most fascinating aspects of this report is the news that paying customers are “significantly” happier with their streaming services than free users. J.D. Powers found that overall satisfaction for paying users was 825, while free users averaged 803. Differences in Customer Service satisfaction were more pronounced. The report said they measured, “significantly higher among paid users (846) than among free users (772).” Communication satisfaction was also cited as “significant” at 800 for paid users and 752 for free users. I suppose it stands to reason that people willing to pay for a service are more likely to be happy with that service. This could also be a general statement on the predisposition of people willing to pay for a service and those not willing to pay for their services. There’s a PhD or two waiting to be earned studying that sort of thing. Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn Reddit Tags: Apple, Apple Music, J.D.

Maria Bernadette Castro01 October, 2016 (REUTERS/Beck Diefenbac)The existing iPad Pro was revealed during an Apple media event on Sept. 9, 2015. Sponsored Watch Your Favorite Christian Films, 24/7. Click Here To Start Your Free Trial Today The iPad Pro 2 is one of the most awaited devices from Apple, but those who are looking for a massive design tweak on the sequel will have to look elsewhere. It is being said that the giant tablet will get some big changes in the design department as Apple focuses on bulking it up on the inside. According to KGI Securities Ming-Chi Kuo, the iPad Pro 2 will be powered by the A10X processor, the latest and most powerful version of Apple's very own line of chipsets. However, there are reports going around that the second-generation iPad Pro will do away with the 3.5-millimeter, much like the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. There is no confirmation for that yet although Apple appears to be considering the possibility. The company is in fact looking into removing the headphone jack from the MacBook Pro as well, at least according to a survey it sent out to its users. Meanwhile, Bloomberg has also reported that the Cupertino-based company wants to focus on software upgrades by making the most of the all new iOS 10 operating system. One of the tech firm's biggest focuses is the Apple Pencil, which, as per the above-mentioned site will be designed into "a handwriting and drawing stylus aimed at professionals." The stylus will give the iPad Pro 2 users the power to annotate objects across the whole operating system not just in certain applications. Apple currently only has this possible in specifically developed apps. But for the iPad Pro 2, the Apple Pencil will allow users to make annotations across the board in various applications including Mail, the Safari web browser, and iMessage. With regards to the release date, the iPad Pro 2 is expected to be released early next year with a new 10.5-inch iPad Pro and the low-cost iPad with 9.7-inch display.

Apple Unveils New iPad Models (Photo : Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) Apple has been rumored to have killed off the iPad Air brand but it turns out as a surprise for everyone when a valid report revealed about the upcoming iPad Air and Pro brands. Loyal Apple fans are drooling over the latest tweaks on the two configurations. The following expected features proved that iPad Air 3 release date is worth the wait. New Configuration - iPad Pro Apple is not finish with the iPad Air brand yet. Instead, the tech giant is rumored to have been added the new configuration iPad Pro according to Mac World. Although it is not yet confirmed, according to the same report netizens speculate on 9.7-inch iPad Pro and iPad Air with a screen resolution of 2048 x 1536 (264 ppi pixel density). Smart Connector for Smart Keyboard Rumors suggesting that a Smart Keyboard Cover will be attach to a Smart Connector located on the left hand edge of the upcoming iPad Air 3. This functionality allows the connected keyboard cover to draw power from the monster battery of iPad Air 3 through the use of Smart Connector. Apple Pencil Compatibility The 12.9-inch iPad Pro is the only Apple tablet that is compatible with Apple pencil when it was launched. It has become the unique selling point of the device at that time. Apple has been flooded with lots of user request for Apple pencil compatibilities with their tablets and the Cupertino-based is rumored to have started the works in the 9.7-inch iPad Pro. Thinner than iPad Air 2 The original iPad Air is 7.5mm thick followed by the iPad Air 2 which is 6.1mm thick. For this matter, Apple is expected to surprise the loyal fans with an iPad Air 3 thinner than 6.1mm according to PC Advisor. Thus, a more powerful but smaller battery is believed to power the new iPad Air model. New Processor iPad Air 3 is rumored to be powered by Apple's proprietary chipset the A10. Similar chips have powered the newly launched iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus which both received good reviews due to excellent device performance.

Rick Munarriz (TMFBreakerRick) Oct 1, 2016 at 9:18AM Image source: Netflix. It's a new month, but October won't be just any month for a few companies. Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG), and GoPro (NASDAQ:GPRO) have a lot riding on events that will play out in the coming weeks. Will the looming catalysts be positive or blow up in investors' faces? Some will offer tricks. Some will offer treats. Let's size up why all four of those stocks could be in for a wild October. Keep your subs above water Netflix reports quarterly results on Oct. 17, and it's going to be an important checkup for the leading premium streaming service. Netflix fell short of subscriber targets during the second quarter, a rare miss for a company that has historically offered conservative guidance that it can easily beat. It also served up uninspiring guidance for the third quarter, and now there are fears that it didn't set the bar low enough. Big-data analytics specialist M Science is forecasting that Netflix gained as many domestic subscribers as it lost during the quarter, well short of the 300,000 net additions that Netflix itself was projecting earlier this summer. This was already going to be a challenging quarter. Longtime subscribers who were grandfathered into the original rate of $7.99 a month for the flagship streaming service when it was bumped up to $8.99 more than two years ago and $9.99 last year now have to pay the current rate. However, that change should have already been baked into Netflix's original outlook. Most of Netflix's growth over the past two years has come from its international gains, but there will be a jolt to the stock if stateside subscribers are peaking.  Smartphones don't know everything September treated iFans to the updated iPhone 7 and Apple Watch Series 2, but Apple was mysteriously silent in pushing out sales data for the iPhone's debut weekend. It warned that it would no longer be doing this -- and a supply shortage on the iPhone Plus end didn't help -- but this does make Apple's Oct. 27 earnings report more interesting than usual. We will finally get sales data on the iPhone and the new Apple Watch, at least through the end of September. Analysts have been warming up to Apple this summer. The iPhone 7 launch appears to be going better than expected, as many were writing it off until we get to next year's 10th anniversary edition. We'll get the final word on initial demand by the end of this new month.  Rolling with the changes Chipotle is another battleground stock that will be posting fresh financials this month. The burrito roller's chance to shine will be Oct. 25, but to be fair, no one is expecting it to shine. Stores continued to post double-digit declines in comps through July, and all indications suggest that this will be the chain's fourth straight quarter of brutal negative same-restaurant sales. This is still the most important quarter since a couple of foodborne-illness outbreaks sent patrons scurrying from the once darling brand late last year. This was the quarter of Chiptopia, the three-month promotion that was supposed to make its most loyal customers come back more often. Chipotle's guidance will also be critical, since the year-over-year comparisons should start to get kinder once we get to November, when the negative press began to sting sales last year. Cameras take flight Netflix, Apple, and Chipotle have big quarterly reports to dole out this month. GoPro does, too -- it should report near the end of the month -- but the real stock movers will be tomorrow's debut of Hero5 and the Oct. 23 rollout of GoPro's Karma drone. Like Chipotle, GoPro's coming off three brutal quarters of sharp sales declines. The path is clearer for a turnaround at GoPro, where analysts see a sharp rebound in sales by the holiday quarter. The new products will go a long way toward getting GoPro there.  Netflix, Apple, Chipotle, and GoPro will be watched closely this month. Expect all four stocks to be volatile as they either step up to the challenge or fall short.  Rick Munarriz owns shares of Apple and Netflix.

(Facebook) Cider and Cortlands and Macs! Oh pie! 8:33 The temperature has dropped into the teens on many days and for many New Brunswickers that means a trip to a local U-pick. Chas MacKay runs MacKay Apple Orchard on the Kingston Peninsula and says the apple crop is good, but he could have used a little more rain. "The thing with rain, and growing apples, it's timing. You'd like to get it at certain times and other times you don't want it at all," said MacKay. McIntosh apples have been ripe for a while now and Cortlands are just beginning to ripen at MacKay's orchard. One thing MacKay has noticed is how people are picking apples. He said at one time people wouldn't pick from the tree, believing only apples that had fallen were ripe. "Everything's changed now. Those stories about picking off the ground, or giving the tree a little shake and the ones that fall are the ones that are ripe, it's kind of changed," said MacKay. While going to a U-pick may now seem like a traditional event, it wasn't always that way. MacKay said the way apple producers make their living has changed quite a bit over the years. "There was a time when I used to sell all my apples, 100 per cent, through stores. And then it changed [to] the U-pick," said MacKay MacKay said the change was spurred in part to a preference from stores to get all their apples from one large producer, as opposed to many smaller ones. When he first started the U-pick he would have to advertise in newspapers and you could never count on a crowd. But technology has changed that. "With Facebook that's all changed. You get too many people sometimes," said MacKay. MacKay's U-pick has one leg up on the grocery store — a greater variety of product. "I've got some apples here that you'll never see them in the stores … they don't have a big shelf life," said MacKay. Just remember the apple season doesn't end after the Thanksgiving holiday. "I've got apples available sort of two weeks after Thanksgiving. But by that time U-picking and going out in the country isn't on people's minds," said MacKay. With files from Shift.

As you can see in the chart below which compares US iPhone users of iOS 10 to iOS 9,  iOS 10 has a 55% to 45% advantage, respectively. Internationally, the numbers are 48% and 52% for iOS 10 and iOS 9, respectively. These figures are corroborated by Mixpanel as well. For more on this, read the full AppLovin report here.   In stark contrast, Google's own recent statistics that are noted below, show last year's Marshmallow release running on less than 19 percent of devices, with 35 percent running Lollipop and nearly 28 percent running KitKat. Some 15 percent of devices are still running 2012's Jelly Bean and 3 percent are using an even older version.   And lastly, even though Android's latest OS called Nougat has been out for a little over a month now, there's still no data about its adoption rate. It's likely a cringingly dismal number considering that Android-Marshmallow was released in October 2015 and it was only able to rack up 18.7% over the entire year.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Hello Blog Book Talk Work Contact 30 Sep 16 My visit to the Apple Museum There is a long list of must-do things for anyone who visits Prague. Like the Charles Bridge, built in 1538. Or the Prague Castle, largest of the world’s ancient castles, dating back to the 9th century. But hell, Prague is also home to the world’s only Apple Museum — which dates all the way back to 2015. And, as an Apple enthusiast, I do have to keep my priorities straight. So, yes, I did visit the Apple Museum on my first day in the Czech Republic last week. (Do I get any points if I walked across the Charles Bridge to get there?) I even sat down with the museum’s manager days later to learn a bit more. Now that I’m back in New York, here are some photos and observations from my little adventure. The Apple Museum is located in a tourist area amid the winding streets of Prague. When I hovered outside the entrance, a museum employee tried to lure me in with a free Apple. (That’s him above.) Little did he know I didn’t need any luring. The signage, inside and out, is set in pixelated Chicago type, harking back to the early days of Macintosh. And, of course, the old rainbow Apple logo is in ample supply. One of the front windows contains a new version of the famous multi-colored iMac “Yum” ad, this one made up of actual computers. Kinda cool and kinda funky all at once. Before I even entered the museum, I did experience one traumatic event. Right there under those colorful iMacs were the words “Think Different.” While many will not notice the grave error in that, the detail-obsessed Apple fan is likely aware that the d in different was never capitalized in Apple’s marketing. It was a simple sentence: Think different. (Just as it is in the actual ads inside the museum.) Steve Jobs might have had someone’s head over that one. Fortunately, I was able to recover from this shock and get on with my mission. The museum houses an extensive private collection of Apple/Steve Jobs technology and artifacts. I’m not sure how a private person amasses such a collection, as some of the items are incredibly valuable or incredibly hard to find. Like the Apple I computer that started it all — complete with a Panasonic cassette deck serving as a data storage device. Of course, there is also an Apple II computer under glass. Embarrassingly, I confess that this computer was actually my point of entry into the Apple world, well before I ever dreamed of creating Apple ads. Except that mine was decked out with two floppy drives. Hey, I was a power user. If it’s beige you seek, there’s plenty of it — from the Apple II, Apple III and Macintosh computers through the Performas and other unmentionables. Having been involved in the introduction of iMac, I found myself staring wistfully at the early models, from Bondi Blue to the multi-colored second generation, to the highly questionable, artistically patterned iMacs (even Jony Ive has his lapses), to the more modern computers shown here. One thing I did not expect to see was the first model of iPod, signed on the back by Steve Jobs himself. Impressive. Given that this is the device that literally changed the course of Apple, this would be the one item in the museum I’d most like to own. (Unfortunately, it was well sealed under glass.) Another nice display is that of Apple’s laptop computers, arranged so one can appreciate just how they’ve evolved over time. I well remember gushing over the first iBooks, silly as they might look today. And of course no history of Steve Jobs would be complete without some items relating to NeXT and Pixar. Both displays are rather small compared to the attention paid to Apple products, but a nice addition. I still regret selling my NeXT Computer. I also wonder if I’ll ever be able to get my data off the NeXT optical disk I kept. Surely there are some old NeXT ad ideas hiding in there. I thought I’d come to the end when I realized there was actually a downstairs as well. It’s kind of dungeon-like down there, but architecturally interesting. It makes you realize how old these buildings are. There are no Apple relics to see below, but some Apple-focused art instead. Most prevalent are a number of paintings—the two Steves and some of the “Crazy Ones” from the Think different campaign. (More than what’s shown here.) But this part is more of a “tribute” area than anything of historic value. Though the museum doesn’t look big from the outside, it feels quite spacious by the time you’ve finished exploring. There were Apple products I had totally forgotten about (lots of peripherals and accessories), and I couldn’t think of any glaring omissions. There’s even a Steve Jobs business card from Apple’s earliest days. And then when you leave—or when you enter, actually—there’s Steven’s Food, which serves up natural treats in the Jobs tradition. On the opposite wall is an appropriately placed “Yum” poster. Walking around this place did make me a bit wispy and emotional. It reminded me how fortunate I was to have had a hand in the marketing of many of these objects—and not get stuck in some ad agency writing ads for insurance or toilet paper. So I left the museum with my thirst for Apple history well satiated. The Apple Museum has the trappings of a homemade museum—don’t expect the Louvre—but in a way that’s perfectly appropriate for a company that started in a garage. The displays are professionally laid out, and anyone interested in Apple history would greatly enjoy spending an hour there. Before I end, I have to say — I really, really love Prague. Despite the way I started this article, the Apple Museum is but one small part of a truly amazing city. Such history and architecture, and a terrific community of creative people. I highly recommend a visit. And while you’re there, I know where you can get a free Apple.

DESIGN #6. iOS10 #2. HARDWARE #7. BATTERY LIFE #3. DUAL CAMERAS #8. NEW COLORS #4. HEADPHONE JACK #9. STEREO SPEAKERS #5. WATERPROOFING #10. THE LITTLE THINGS CONCLUSION September 7. This was the day when Apple finally took the wraps off its new iPhone generation after several months full of controversy, mostly fueled by leaks that pointed to the changes Cupertino planned for its flagship product. And truth be told, many of the changes that showed up in leaks earlier this year made their way onto the iPhone 7, and this is why we now have a phone without a headphone jack and a secondary speaker grille that hides virtually… nothing. Leaving aside all the criticism, the iPhone 7 is here and Apple launched it with much fanfare, describing it as “the best iPhone ever.” Cupertino obviously praised pretty much every single change that it made on this phone, even those that were highly criticized - as is the case of the headphone jack - and talked about the removal of some options as an act of courage, a thing that Steve Jobs himself described as something that Apple needs to do because of its spirit. To determine whether the new iPhone is worth all the praises, we took two different models, one in Rose Gold and one in black, to see what they’re up to. On September 7, Apple broke down the iPhone 7 unveiling into 10 different parts, and we’re going to do the same thing for our review. Read on to find out everything about the new iPhone 7 Plus, including things that nobody has talked about before in other reviews. iPhone 7 Plus dual cameras - notice the white antenna lines on the Rose Gold #1. The iPhone 7 Plus design If you've used the bigger iPhone 6 or 6s before, there's nothing to really be excited about when seeing the new iPhone 7 Plus. As suggested by the majority of the controversial rumors we've mentioned in the introduction, the iPhone 7 Plus looks pretty much the same as its predecessor, with very small changes that are unlikely to impress anyone. The design is largely the same and the new model even has the same dimensions - 158.2 x 77.9 x 7.3 mm (6.23 x 3.07 x 0.29 inches), but is a little bit lighter - 188 grams versus 192 grams on the 6s Plus. Visually, the only changes are taking place on the back, with the antenna lines now moved to the top and bottom edges of the phone. One very unexpected detail is that antenna lines are not painted in the same color as the phone, so although one of the models we tested was Rose Gold, the antenna lines were white. The Plus comes with a dual-camera system that might indeed bring technical improvements (we'll detail that a little bit later), but aesthetically, this approach looks odd, to say the least. The camera bump is meh and we would have rather preferred a design similar to the Nexus 6P where the entire top edge that includes the camera is protruding. Because of the uninspired camera design, the iPhone 7 Plus looks awkward when sitting on the desk and it's impossible to use it with one hand on a flat surface. One little detail that very few seem to observe is that the iPhone logo on the back of the phone is now written with a bold font, which helps it stand out quite easily. The same approach is used on the iPhone box, which has also received several tweaks, including a bold font for the iPhone logo. All in all, there's very little to be excited about when looking at the iPhone 7 Plus and, at first glance, you can hardly find a reason to upgrade from an iPhone 6s Plus. But it's not all about the looks. iPhone 7 Plus front view - almost no changes as compared to 6s series #2. The upgraded hardware Since it's a new generation, it makes sense for the iPhone 7 to come with upgraded hardware, and the Plus model does not disappoint. Just as expected, the iPhone 7 Plus comes with the Apple A10 Fusion chip which, according to Cupertino itself, is not only more power efficient but also faster and more powerful. Specifically, the A9 processor available on the 6s plus was a dual-core chip clocked at 1.84 GHz, while on the 7 Plus, Apple went for a quad-core CPU running at 2.23 GHz. This is a worthy upgrade, but you won't notice such a big difference in real-life performance, as iOS 10 is super optimized on the iPhone 6s Plus too - a somewhat noticeable difference can be seen when browsing the web with Safari, as websites seem to load faster, but this could very well be a placebo effect. Apple has also upgraded the amount of RAM available on the Plus from 2GB to 3GB, which is pretty much a mandatory move given the fact that the new model comes with a dual-camera system and it needs more power to process photos. “Just as fast as the 6s Plus.” There are new storage versions, and while the iPhone 6s Plus was previously available with 16, 64, and 128 GB of storage space, the new version comes with 32, 128, and 256 GB. Obviously, there's no microSD card option. The 5.5-inch display is pretty much the same with the one installed on the 6s Plus, with one big difference: it features wide-color gamut support, which leads to better contrast and perfectly balanced brightness levels. In a market where everyone is moving to AMOLED, Apple seems to continuously find new ways to maximize the potential of LCD screens, and we really don't exaggerate when saying that the iPhone 7 Plus has the best iPhone display ever. Apple has also replaced the Home button with a touch-sensitive one and there are three pre-defined vibration intensity levels that can be configured in iOS 10. The change was necessary for more effective waterproofing, but also to pave the road for what's believed to be a complete makeover of the iPhone next year when all front-facing parts would be integrated into the display. While there's no headphone jack, the iPhone 7 Plus comes with stereo speakers, but you won't feel such a big difference and the new model is just as loud as its predecessor. You can read more about this in the dedicated section below. #3. The dual cameras The cameras are without a doubt the most important upgrade, especially when talking about the Plus version of the new iPhone lineup. While aesthetically the dual-camera system looks odd on the iPhone 7 Plus, it does serve its purpose well, even though there are still things to be improved here. But let's take everything one at a time to discuss it. iPhone 7 Plus camera sample, wallpaper quality photo without any edits First and foremost, the specs. The iPhone 6s Plus came with a single-lens 12-megapixel camera with F2.2, 1/3" sensor size, and 1.2 um pixel size. The 7 Plus has been upgraded to two different cameras, with the following specs: the wide-angle camera has F1.8 aperture, while the telephoto lens is F2.8, but offers instead an optical zoom of 2x. The iPhone 7 Plus is thus one of the first smartphones to offer optical zoom, and although it's just 2x for the time being (10x digital zoom is also offered), this is just the beginning of what could be mobile revolution. iPhone 7 Plus dual camera on the Rose Gold version For the moment, however, we've found us rarely using the telephoto lens, and most of the photos were shot with the main sensor that's also available on the smaller 4.7-inch iPhone. So if you don't mind not taking pics with the telephoto lens, you should be OK with the small iPhone too. iPhone 7 Plus camera sample with improved performance for detail shots The aperture upgrade on the iPhone 7 Plus makes it possible for the new model to shoot better pictures in low light, and this is clearly the biggest upgrade on the new generation. The iPhone 7 Plus finally sees in the dark and offers performance similar to the Samsung Galaxy S7/Note 7 series. The photos below compare the low-light performance of the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus - notice that the latter also manages to adjust brightness in a very effective manner, although we've noticed that, sometimes, the amount of red isn't properly handled, while the Samsung model uses more yellow. The quad-LED True Tone flash also helps compensate for distorted colors in low-light, but it's better not to use it at all if you want photos to look more natural. iPhone 7 Plus (left) and Samsung Galaxy Note 7 (right) low-light shot In perfect light conditions, both models shoot stunning photos and the iPhone 7 Plus certainly does not disappoint. The telephoto lens also takes awesome pics when the light is just the right one, but other than that, there's often too much noise, and sharpness seems to be missing entirely. Software processing continues to be an important part of Apple's photo shooting equation, and this is clearly no surprise. Most of the photos receive several finishing touches, such as automatically adjusted contrast and brightness, and in most of the cases, the result is above the average. “Better camera, but there's still room for improvements.” The iPhone 7 Plus also comes with a Portrait mode, currently available in beta versions of iOS 10, which adds a blur effect around the subject for more high-quality shots. More improvements are needed here as well, though, because the amount of blur that it uses is too high and, in some cases, this effect covers the margins of the subject. iPhone 7 Plus Portrait mode, sometimes with blur incorrectly applied The Samsung Galaxy Note 7 integrates a dedicated portrait mode as well, but in this case, options are far more advanced and Apple should really have this in mind for future improvements. The Note 7 lets users take one portrait shot and then decide where to put the focus, either in front or in the background, thus adjusting the position of the blur effect too. Macro shot: iPhone 7 Plus (left) vs. Samsung Galaxy Note 7 (right) OIS is obviously available, now on the smaller iPhone as well, and so is exposure control and auto HDR. Apple claims that the iPhone uses Sapphire crystal lens cover, but scratch tests have shown that it's actually regular glass that's more or less prone to damage. Overall, the iPhone 7 Plus shoots the best photos ever in the iPhone lineup, but it's still a little behind Samsung's flagship devices. At the moment, the S7/Note 7 offer the best camera in the smartphone business, but the iPhone 7 Plus certainly isn't far behind. #4. No headphone jack Definitely the most controversial change in the iPhone 7 lineup, the removal of the headphone jack turned the new model into a highly criticized device that's nearly impossible to use for listening to music while charging. But again, let's take everything one at a time to see what this is all about. So Apple decided to remove the headphone jack, and the company claimed it did it for 3 different reasons: the 3.5mm audio port is analog whereas the Lightning port is digital, and it not ony recharges the headphones but also allows you to control music without touching the phone; the need for space inside the phone; and the struggle for getting everything wireless. To compensate for the removal of the headphone jack, Apple is offering a Lightning set of headphones inside the box, as well as an adapter that converts the traditional analog port to Lightning. And yet, not having a headphone jack is super inconvenient. Just the other day when I was driving and using Waze for GPS navigation, I realized that talking on the phone behind the wheel is a nightmare. Using a traditional jack headphone set is no longer possible, and given the fact that the phone was connected to the car charger, the Lightning headphones that Apple included in the box could not be used. In this case, a Bluetooth headset was the only way to go, but it obviously costs extra. And because I didn't have one around, I had no other option than to reject the call. Just because I have an iPhone 7. iPhone 7 Plus Lightning port and no headphone jack... goodbye, old friend! #5. Waterproofing Apple has always been considered the most innovative company in the world, while all the others were followers that adopted its ideas in one form or another. But with the iPhone 7, things are a little bit different, as Apple is now doing the same thing Samsung did earlier this year: waterproofing its phones. Both iPhone 7 models are IP67 rated, which means that they offer the maximum protection when it comes to liquids and almost the maximum protection against dust. IP stands for Ingress Protection and the 67 rating shows that the iPhone 7 can survive being submerged for 30 minutes in water with a depth of 1 meter. The Samsung Galaxy S7 and the Note 7 are both rated IP68, but the difference only concerns dust protection, so in terms of waterproofing, they all offer the same level of protection. “Water resistant, but you'd better stay away from liquids!” And even though the iPhone 7 is officially water-resistant, you shouldn't expose it to liquids by any means. Apple clearly states that warranty doesn't cover liquid damage unless you have a premium package, so the company doesn't take any risk with it (for what it's worth, Samsung is doing the same thing for the S7 and Note 7 lineup, so it's not just Apple). In order to waterproof the iPhone, Apple used lots of glue and the iFixIt teardown has shown that the company indeed made some changes that were specifically implemented to keep water away from internal parts. For instance, the SIM tray now has some rubber around its external edges to prevent water from slipping in, while the removal of the physical Home button had the same purpose. In the end, the iPhone 7 shouldn't be taken into the shower, but water resistance is the kind of feature that's welcome just because it's there. It can prevent damages occurring after small accidents, and it's no longer a huge risk to use it during light rain. #6. iOS 10 iOS 10 is the new version of Apple's mobile operating system, and it brings several improvements, including new 3D Touch features, widgets, and redesigned notifications. In terms of exclusive iPhone 7 features, there's not much to be excited about, so in case you've previously used iOS 10 on any other iPhone, it's almost the same boring experience. The only difference is that you get some extra options to configure the vibration feedback of the Home button - with three different levels - as well as a new Portrait mode for photos, which is only available in beta for the moment, so only those who are participating in the program can give it a try. Other than that, there are small changes here and there, which are indeed nice and everyone would actually like them, but they remain exclusive to iPhone 7, so the operating system is 99 percent the same as on the iPhone 6s lineup. #7. Battery life Since it comes with a dual-camera system and other small upgrades, it makes sense for the new iPhone to feature a bigger battery too, especially because it needs more power to handle these hardware upgrades. And Apple delivered it, so the iPhone 7 Plus is upgraded from 2750 mAh on the predecessor to 2900 mAh. In terms of battery life, the iPhone 7 Plus provides almost the same performance as the older model, but with small differences depending on usage patterns. While providing accurate figures is quite difficult given that each buyer uses the phone in a different way, it's worth mentioning that the iPhone 7 Plus provides approximately 28 hours of battery life for the hardcore user and 36 hours with moderate usage. Charging takes just as much as before and you need approximately 100 minutes to fully recharge the iPhone. There's no fast charging mode and this is quite a drawback, considering that Samsung is already offering it on its flagship. Also, there's no wireless charging, but rumor has it Apple is working on it for the next generation. #8. The new colors The iPhone 7 Plus is available in five different colors: Rose Gold, Gold, Silver, Black, Jet Black. The two new colors are Black and Jet Black, but there's a catch. First and foremost, the Jet Black version is super glossy, and although it might look good, it's extremely prone to scratches. There's a big chance that after a few months of moderate use without a case, the Jet Black gets a more vintage look, despite the fact that it's designed to be ultra durable. What's important, however, is that the Jet Black has excellent grip. The Black version, on the other hand, doesn't provide the same level of grip, but it's not slippery either. It looks good on the iPhone 7 Plus and gives you the impression that it's smaller, even though we all know this is not the case. And once again, Apple has decided to keep the antenna lines on the iPhone 7 white/gray and not paint them in the same color as the rest of the phone. On the Rose Gold, the antenna lines don't seem to blend into the rest of the iPhone, and it doesn't make any sense. This affects the overall look of the iPhone, as the gray antenna lines help you realize how big the device actually is. iPhone 7 Plus rear shot for Black and Rose Gold versions #9. The stereo speakers One of the things that Apple claims it has improved on the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus is the audio quality of the speakers - and yes, it's the plural here because now there are two of them, as the new model is stereo. But when upgrading from the iPhone 6s Plus to the iPhone 7 Plus, the difference between the two is almost unnoticeable in terms of speaker performance. The audio quality of the new model is indeed a little higher, but otherwise, the iPhone 7 just as loud as its predecessor. If you're the type of person who uses the device to watch TV or talk on the phone on speaker while driving, there are big chances that you're going to want the iPhone to be louder, but for the moment, the stereo speakers just don't match our expectations. iPhone 7 Plus stereo and not so much, only small improvements actually noticeable #10. The little things that matter Apple has made some changes that might not be noticed at first glance, but they are certainly a nice touch to an otherwise dull upgrade for so many buyers. For example, Apple has also overhauled the iPhone 7 box. First of all, the face of the iPhone is no longer on the box, but the back, as Apple wants to make it clear that its new model comes with a dual-camera system - and this makes sense given the fact that there are almost no visual changes to the front side of the phone. Furthermore, the iPhone branding on the box now uses a bold font, and the same approach is used for the back of the phone too, thus making it a little bit more visible. “Oh, sweet soft vibrations...” When you open the box, the phone is no longer the first thing you see, but the user manual which clearly reads "Designed by Apple in California." The phone is just underneath it, probably in an attempt to prevent accidents when the iPhone dropped to the ground when opening the box. The iPhone picture on the box has the exact same size as the phone, so you can actually see how big the Plus is without opening the box. Another thing that's worth mentioning is that the SIM tray now uses sealing material for waterproofing and you'll see that when inserting the SIM for activation. There's also a small vibration when toggling between silent and ringer, as well as a secondary speaker grille that doesn't seem to do anything - we tried covering it and still no result in sound quality or level. The notification screen now vibrates when swiping it down, and this is another pleasant touch, and so does the Home button whenever you touch it. THE BOTTOM LINE We've heard lots of people calling the iPhone 7 Plus a dull phone that has nothing to offer over Samsung's flagship products, and many claimed this is the reason Apple's sales are collapsing. First of all, Apple's sales are not collapsing. The decline experienced this year wasn't a decline in iPhone sales, but a decline in iPhone's growth, so the company's flagship product keeps growing, only that it doesn't do it at the same pace anymore. Then, the iPhone 7 Plus can only be considered a dull release in terms of visual design, as the phone comes with several upgrades under the hood that make it a worthy investment. Even if you can't get over its looks, you have to try the iPhone 7 Plus, especially thanks to its camera. The dual-camera system might not be the most revolutionary technology launched so far, but the main lens offers an impressive upgrade over the 6s, so it's exactly what makes the iPhone 7 Plus special. This is what Apple has been aiming for and this is what it achieved. There are several other important upgrades, including waterproofing and the new Home button, which provides quite a premium feeling to the touch, but in the end, the iPhone 7 Plus seems to be more of a transition model whose sales might not be as big as the ones recorded by predecessors. But Apple has more or less accepted this because iPhone 7's role might be much more important than it seems: it paves the way for a bigger overhaul coming next year, so the new Home button and the removal of the headphone jack took place now in order to prepare the world for the 2017 iPhone, which will come with a plethora of upgrades, including a new design. Apple needed such a transition model to make sure that next year's iPhone is successful, so by implementing these controversial changes now, Cupertino has kind of accepted the risk of lower sales. In the end, the iPhone 7 Plus is a worthy upgrade if you can afford it, but other than that, you're not going to lose too much if you stick with the iPhone 6s Plus.   CHECK OUT THE GALLERY  (109 Images) #Apple#iPhone 7#iPhone 7 Plus#iPhone review#iPhone 7 review subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it iPhone 7 Plus (109 Images) 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 101 102 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news iPhone SE Review - Best Phone... of 2012 Apple iPhone 6s Review - The Original Sin Apple iPhone 6s Plus Review - The Special One iPhone 6 Plus Review – It’s Big Alright Microsoft Replaces Command Prompt with PowerShell in Latest Windows 10 Build Microsoft Can’t Kill Linux Right Now, The Linux Foundation Director Says iPhone 6 and 6 Plus “Touch Disease” Repairs Cost $149, Apple Says German Police Considering Move to Windows Phones to Fight Traffic Jams Hacker Breaks into Italian Government Website, 45,000 Users Exposed Samsung Galaxy J3 (2017) Leaks in Press Render NVIDIA Makes Available New GeForce Graphics Hotfix Driver - Version 375.95 Three UK Hacked, Details of 6 Million Customers at Risk 109 photos    iPhone 7 Plus rear view new ios apps NeuroNation: Train your brain to improve your memory and focus with NeuroNation Flipagram: Create cool videos by mixing up your photos with music Timer+: Set up dozens of timers and control them all with ease Nutshell Camera: Create some pretty cool videos with Nutshell Camera IKEA Catalogue: Check out the IKEA Catalogue for more than just furniture Complete: Complete puts a social twist to your regular to-do list/ task manager WebMD Baby: WebMD Baby offers help in how to best tend to your baby Reader comments Load old comments   BlackBerry DTEK50 Review more on: BlackBerry DTEK50 i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

The Stormfront store in the Kingsgate centre in Huddersfield was among the shops targeted by Paul Mumloong Chan. During a six-month spree Chan obtained 283 phones, Leeds Crown Court heard. Nick Adlington, prosecuting, said Apple had offered to replace phones if they were found to have a fault. Chan would take the counterfeit phones in which could not be powered up so the fault could not be checked on the premises. They would have to be sent away for examination and in the meantime Chan would be given a replacement of a genuine iPhone. Leeds Crown Court Chan used a number of false names during his visits to various outlets not just in Huddersfield but in Hull, Wakefield, Nottingham and Preston as well as the Apple stores in Manchester and Liverpool. When he was finally traced a “how to commit fraud guide” supplied to him by those behind the scam was found giving information on using false identities and advising him not to store the real phones at his home. Mr Adlington said Chan indicated initially that he did not believe he had done anything wrong. The loss to Apple was £124,000 but they indicated the case was part of a larger fraud against them involving at least 400 phones. Mohammed Nawaz, representing Chan, said the prosecution accepted from chat and text messages that another man had introduced him to the fraud. The court heard he is now believed to be in China.

He had now got a job as deputy manager at a café and was terrified at the thought of going to prison and the effect on his family. Chan, 36 of Woodstock Road, Moston, Manchester, admitted fraud and was jailed for two years. Judge Sally Cahill QC said: “This offence involved you going to retail premises where you took fraudulent iPhones and changed them for the real thing. You did so by claiming the phone was not working and took advantage of the exchange of phones by Apple.” She said the prosecution accepted others were involved “but you chose to involve yourself.” Read More Today's top stories Gallery@HD1 in trouble Man tried to choke busker Mill set to be knocked down £30k spent in ONE day at store Like us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter Daily Newsletter Follow @Examiner Subscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribe More On Apple Kingsgate Huddersfield news all Most Read Most Recent MelthamHow a kind stranger in Morrisons left Meltham mum weeping at the checkout A stranger has made a "substantial" donation to Meltham mum Anja Etty's fundraising efforts HuddersfieldWatch cars navigate HUGE puddle at Cooper Bridge as queues stretch back to M62 Minor flooding under railway bridge caused misery for rush hour commuters FacebookLive: Huddersfield breaking news, M62 and travel What's happening in Huddersfield today?

(AP File Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez)   Alex Webb Bloomberg     So far Apple's HealthKit has mostly collected fitness data from its devices. In the future, if the company gets its way, the software will interpret that information, turning it into advice for users, doctors and others. Scores of health-care experts hired by Apple in recent years are building improved electronic health record software that can better analyze and understand the implications of patient data, according to people familiar with the team's plans. The iPhone maker is also working on new apps for the Apple Watch. One helps users track sleep patterns, one of the people said. Another app gauges fitness levels by measuring the time taken for the heart rate to fall from its peak to resting level, according to one of the other people. Apple already has an app that measures heart rate, but doesn't interpret that data. The ultimate goal of Apple's medical technology team is to turn HealthKit into a tool that improves diagnoses, the people said. The system could chip away at two problems that plague the industry and have stumped other specialist firms in the field: interoperability -- allowing data to be transferred from hospital to hospital across different databases; and analysis -- making it quick and easy for physicians to extrapolate salient information from mountains of data. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook wants Apple to do more in software and services to secure new sources of revenue and make customers more dependent on the company's devices. The $8 trillion global health-care industry is a big opportunity. "If you drive for a while and your car gets too hot, it says pull over. If you need an oil change, it says check your oil. What's the equivalent for the body?" Cook said at a May conference in Amsterdam. "Health is a huge issue around the world and we think it's ripe for simplicity and a new view." An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment. Earlier this year, Apple bought Gliimpse Inc., a startup that built software to pull electronic health records from different databases and in different formats, then store them in one place. "I will be working on building a platform, a set of application program interfaces, and a simple product that will bring what we believe will be a disruptive consumer health-care application to the U.S. for the first time," Apple Health senior engineer Mohan Randhava wrote on his LinkedIn profile, which states he was employed at Gliimpse until February. He likened the product to Apple's music business. That started with the iPod, but as people became accustomed to storing all their music files digitally, Apple built a lucrative music platform on top of the device. Apple health software could become a revenue driver, too, by keeping people wedded to the company's devices. If a patient's health records, and related suggestions, are accessible through Apple's system, it would be harder to trade in an iPhone for a smartphone running Google's Android operating system, and its health-tracking software Google Fit. The second version of Apple's Watch has a faster processor, a built-in GPS tracker and is water resistant so people can run, swim and do other exercise with the device. The updated Watch software, dubbed watchOS 3, places health tracking information more prominently in the user interface, and adds a breathing exercise app as well as swim tracking. Building more sensors into the Watch serves a limited purpose. An accelerometer can generate most of the useful data needed to monitor a person's well-being, according to one person with knowledge of Apple's plans. A glucometer or blood-pressure sensor would only help a small percentage of users, the person said. Adding new medical sensors would also likely require approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, a much higher bar for Apple to cross. "If they are going to an FDA device, it would need to have enough battery life to last a day, and something where it independently functions from your phone," said Yuri Teshler, a health-care consultant at Moor Insights & Strategy. Apple can't really do anything more with health-related sensors until the watch has a wireless LTE chip and the independent cellular connection that comes with that, he added. Apple has so far struggled to do that. It's unclear how soon improvements to Apple's HealthKit may be introduced. ResearchKit, another Apple software, lets research institutions and drugmakers conduct clinical trials using iPhone apps, and some of the trials hint at possible future applications for HealthKit. Each clinical study using ResearchKit brings Apple a step closer to embedding itself in hospitals, labs and doctors' surgeries. North Carolina's Duke University developed a ResearchKit app using the iPhone's front-facing camera to conduct facial recognition checks which try to screen for and diagnose autism. Johns Hopkins University is using the Apple Watch's accelerometer and heart-rate sensor to track the onset and duration of seizures and try to predict them. In July, GlaxoSmithKline PLC became the first drugmaker to start a ResearchKit clinical study. "Apple is working hard with many of these large institutions to generate tools that are medically correct, to take data from sensors," said Scott Jenkins, CEO of health data management company Certainty Health LLC. "They want to be the repository, the open collection space." Stephen Friend, a Merck & Co. veteran who founded health data nonprofit Sage Bionetworks, is credited with being the brains behind ResearchKit. He joined Apple full-time in June having worked as a consultant for more than two years. Flipboard co-founder Evan Doll rejoined Apple in July as a director of health software engineering. Yoky Matsuoka, formerly technology chief at Google's Nest Labs unit, also joined Apple's health team last year. Nest is known mostly as a hardware specialist, but Matsuoka led the development of software that interpreted and learned from data that its internet-connected thermostats collect. She's using that machine-learning experience as she oversees a health-data team at Apple. Apple's greatest hurdle for now is proving to medical professionals that data delivered from wearables through HealthKit and ResearchKit is reliable. Brennan Spiegel, a gastroenterologist at Los Angeles' Cedars-Sinai Hospital, said clinical studies are crucial to making wearables useful. "It's wonderful to have advanced methods of aggregating and presenting data, but there's a risk of it becoming a garbage-in, garbage-out project," Spiegel said. "It doesn't matter how sophisticated the technical solution is. What matters is whether the data going into that solution are generating clinically valuable, actionable results that's improving human health in a way that's cost-effective." -- With assistance from Mark Gurman and Marie Mawad Article Comments (0) Tweet This article filed under: Business Technology Health & Fitness Bloomberg Comments () Guidelines: Keep it civil and on topic; no profanity, vulgarity, slurs or personal attacks.

Planning a vacation? Check out the best travel deals and destinations Opinion Keep smartphones safe from hackers? Go old school Apple unveils iPhone 7 Apple Inc has unveiled its new iPhone 7, with the widely expected removal of the analog headphone jack as well as a dual camera on some models and new wireless headphones called Air Pods. Apple Inc has unveiled its new iPhone 7, with the widely expected removal of the analog headphone jack as well as a dual camera on some models and new wireless headphones called Air Pods. Q&A: Learning to live with iPhone 7 As technology — not just pop culture, sports and politics — drives conversation, the latest iteration of Apple's iPhone stirred consumer passion earlier this month: Would wireless headphone technology be expensive and inconvenient? To put consumer fears and frustrations into perspective, as the pace of technological change unfolds, the Orlando Sentinel Editorial Board turned to Juan Gilbert of the University of Florida, the chairman of the department of computer and information sciences and engineering in the College of Engineering.  Juan Gilbert John Jernigan JJSS / Courtesy photo Juan Gilbert Juan Gilbert (John Jernigan JJSS / Courtesy photo) Q: Steve Jobs always maintained that Apple's job was to tell customers what they wanted, not the other way around. Is the iPhone 7 a continuation of that legacy? A: It's hard to say. The iPhone 7 is an extension of iPhone 6. One can argue that it's following that theme or you could argue that it's just the next step. Personally, I see it as the next step.   Q: Has the iPhone peaked in terms of how much Apple can improve new versions? Is this indicative of the market for smartphones in general? A: It has far from peaked. There's much more to come with mobile devices. Every time there's a release of a new phone, this question is asked, but there's still more to come. Stay tuned.   Customers check out the new Apple iPhone 7. Richard Vogel / AP Customers check out the new Apple iPhone 7. Customers check out the new Apple iPhone 7. (Richard Vogel / AP) Q: Does the move away from the headphone jack indicate that people really don't care about the quality of music any longer? Or will the quality be better with the new connection? A: Bluetooth has arrived. It's mature, and the quality is really good. I can't speak for Apple, but I doubt the reason for getting rid of the headphone jack was about people ignoring quality. It's most likely about the proliferation of Bluetooth and the quality it delivers. Going wireless was the next logical step.   Q: Beyond the iPhone specifically, can consumers who use smartphones ever be safe from hackers? A: Great question. Yes, you can be safe from hackers using a smartphone, but it depends on how far you want to go to protect your data and privacy. For example, you can disable location, never use the web browser, etc. and only use your smartphone as a phone. This is old school, but it would certainly protect you.   Q: Is it realistic to think consumers can keep our personal information away from data brokers? A: This is very challenging. I don't know if there's a good answer without federal government involvement. As long as it's acceptable to acquire this information, then this will happen. I heard a crazy statistic that if we read all of the privacy agreements we get on our phone, they would amount to some crazy number of days. So, I don't see a solution on the horizon anytime soon.   Q: Beyond consumer issues related to smartphones, you have championed efforts to increase the number of minorities in the computing disciplines. How do your efforts at the University of Florida compare with those nationally? A: There are approximately 150 black/African-American computing sciences doctoral students in the United States. The University of Florida has 17. We have the nation’s largest group of black/African-American computer-science doctoral students in the nation. We have a new doctorate degree in human-centered computing that is majority female, majority minority and majority U.S citizen. The UF cares about diversity. It’s important to our nation that we have full participation in computing from all members of our society, and we have done a very good job at increasing our diversity at the UF. Q: As young people consider careers in computing disciplines, what advice would you offer? A: Computing is everywhere and in just about everything. President Obama launched the CS4All initiative because The White House understands the impact computing has had and will continue to have on our society. I tell young people to strongly consider a career in computing and if they don’t pursue a career in computing, they need to be computer literate, at a minimum. Q: Science — especially technology — doesn’t get much mention in this year’s presidential campaign, except for hacking of campaigns. What specific issue would you like to see addressed? Can you make the case for it’s importance for national security? A: Definitely. I would like to ask the candidates: Do you support the CS4All initiative? How do you see computing as it relates to our economic future in the United States? Do you plan to support additional funding for computer-science research at the National Science Foundation and other agencies? With respect to national security, we hear about companies and the government being hacked. Many people believe the next war will be fought in cyberspace. If that’s the case, who are our soldiers? If we don’t build a domestic computing workforce, it will put our nation at a disadvantage economically and from a security point of view. It’s essential that we invest in computing to develop our own talent to ensure we have cybersoldiers (that’s my term) Privacy Policy Copyright © 2016, Orlando Sentinel Apple iPhone University of Florida Apple Inc.

While Apple’s ongoing struggles with VirnetX began in 2010, this latest retrial ruled that the company’s FaceTime platform used the latter’s patented internet security technology without gaining permission. Despite the argument that VirnetX could be considered little more than a patent troll, Apple has continually come up on the losing side in court. An initial ruling in 2012 ordered Apple to pay $368 million after using the patented virtual private networking tech in the iPhone 4S, but that was thrown out by the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in September 2015. Then a retrial was held in February of this year, combining two actions brought by VirnetX, and there a jury ruled that Apple needed to pay $625 million. But that ruling was voided as well, with a judge saying that the trial was unfair due to the jury being confused by repeated references to the previous case. Thus another retrial was ordered, bringing us to today. There’s no doubt that VirnetX intentionally brought its case against Apple to the East Texas Federal District Court, which is known to rule in favor of patent holders. In addition, Apple’s struggles with VirnetX are likely far from over, as they’ve recently filed a new suit over the use of security features in iOS’s iMessage app. SOURCE Reuters Story Timeline Apple to challenge the VirnetX Facetime patent infringment ruling VirnetX revives 2012 patent case against Apple, wants more monies Apple now owes VirnetX more than what Samsung owes it Apple won't need to pay VirnetX a single cent, for now Tags AppleBusinessFaceTimelawsuitlegalpatent Must Read Bits & Bytes Bucking trends, Acura reveals vision of tomorrow’s dashboard Now Alfa Romeo has an SUV, and we have so many questions 2017 Honda Civic Hatchback First Drive Jaguar I-PACE Concept previews Model X rivaling EV for 2018 MacBook Pro with Touch Bar Review (late-2016) Latest Headlines Ballu is part blimp and part robot Nov 18, 2016 Amazon Prime Video ready for global rollout soon Nov 18, 2016 SpaceX wants to launch 4,425 satellites for global internet connectivity Nov 18, 2016 Smaller Xiaomi Mi Mix packing 5.5-inch screen could be called Nano tips leak Nov 18, 2016 Scientists say asteroid strike that killed dinosaurs made a crater higher than Mt.

TechShout Gadgets Software Hardware Mobile Phones Internet Apple Features Everything Else Home Apple Angry man smashes up iPhones in Apple Store rampage Apple Angry man smashes up iPhones in Apple Store rampage By Bindu Nair - Representational Image Only A frustrated Apple customer took matters into his own hands in a bizarre incident which took place in the company’s Dijon outlet in France. The man can be seen in multiple videos smashing up iPhones and a MacBook one after another with what seems to be a metal ball. The angry patron began his rampage by calmly laying down iPhones flat on the table and then destroying them with a heavy steel ball which 9to5Mac says is utilized in the French game Boules. He demolished at least 10 iPhones in such a manner before directing his attention to one MacBook Air. The disgruntled man interspersed his destruction with angry rants about his consumer rights. According to some publications, he’s accusing Apple of refusing to honor EU requirements to guarantee a two-year warranty for all goods. Thankfully, he reserved all his frustrations for the products and not any humans hanging around in the store based on the fact that there aren’t any reports of injuries. Also Read: Thief dressed as Apple employee walks off with $16000 in iPhones The irate protestor was later apprehended by mall security and prevented from re-entering the Apple Store by the outlet’s employees. He didn’t stay put though, attempting to make a run for it. He was caught immediately and made to wait for the police. Apple probably won’t take this lying down, which means the man’s actions could cost him thousands of dollars. Smashing iPhones to smithereens is an expensive business and the chances of the company going to court to recover the damages are very likely.

The battle between the two companies has been going on for some time, with a jury previously ruling that Apple owed more than $600 million to the "non-practicing entity" VirnetX. As Reuters reports, the new trial in Tyler, Texas was ordered by judge Robert Schroeder, who threw out VirnetX's previous $625.6 million win over Apple due to the jury being 'confused'. Related: iPhone 7 The latest retrial involved the jury determining damages on two VirnetX patents Apple had been found to infringe, as well as determining infringement and damages on a further two patents. A report from Bloomberg states "the ultimate decision will lie with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, which specializes in patent law." In other words, the whole thing is far from over, with Apple undoubtedly looking into appealing the latest decision. What's more, Reuters reports Nevada-based VirnetX is also suing Apple over further security features and its iMessage platform. The original case with VirnetX began in 2010, with the patent licensor being awarded $368 million in 2012, before that decision was thrown out in 2014. VinetX's lawyers then purued Apple with a second suit, which resulted in the larger $625.6 million verdict – one of the highest amounts ever for a U.S. patent case, before it too was thrown out prior to this latest trial.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « A Disgruntled Apple Customer Exacts his Revenge by Smashing 16 iPhones and a MacBook (Extended Video) | Main | Apple's iOS 10 Adoption Rate hits 55% in the U.S. in just Weeks » October 01, 2016 VirnetX won another round against Apple in their Never Ending Patent Infringement Case over FaceTime Technology   Apple has been fighting VirnetX since 2010. Apple lost their first case to VirnetX back in 2012. Just as that lawsuit ended, VirnetX was back in court the very same day filing yet another patent infringement case against Apple. Apple then appealed in 2014 and VirnetX appealed again and won. Apple filed a motion for a mistrial in February of this year. Then in May we reported that VirnetX had filed an injunction to force Apple to shut down patent infringing FaceTime and iMessage. In August VirnetX's stock plunged when a Judge voided the $625 million verdict against Apple. Apple was on a roll by getting UPSTO to invalidate 4 VirnetX Patents complicating their September 26 trial. But in the end, it's being reported by Reuters that Apple lost the case on Friday being ordered to pay VirnetX $302 million in damages for using their technology in FaceTime without permission.   The next step in this case is VirnetX will be back in court with Apple over willful infringement which could double Friday's verdict.   Without a doubt Apple will appeal once again, especially because the majority of the patents have been invalidated by the U.S. Patent Office. That process of invalidation will take years to iron out for a final verdict.   Cases this complicated shouldn't be tried by the Tyler Texas patent troll happy court. For this case to ever end correctly it has to go before a higher court and hopefully before judges specializing in patent infringement law.   With that said, Friday's verdict is just another round in what appears to be a case that will drag on for over a decade before it's finally concluded.

He smashed at least 13 iPhones in retaliation. (Image: REUTERS) What can you do if you ask for a refund at a store because you were not happy with something? In most cases, you simply walk out. But an angry Frenchman, who appeared cool, chose to differ. He walked out only after smashing at least 13 iPhones (iPhone 6s or iPhone 7) along with a MacBook with a petanque ball. What is a petanque ball? Never mind. A video shot by another customer (@Quentin_IOS) at an Apple Store in Dijon, France shows the raw power of consumers, especially angry ones. While the video went viral on the internet, details on why exactly did the man become violent is still unclear. However, the man appeared clearly prepared in the video to take on Apple. He was careful enough to wear gloves to protect his fingers from broken pieces of iPhones and also to get a better grip. The voices in the video revealed that the angry man was refused a refund for some product at the Apple Store. The man was heard in the video saying: "Ladies and gentlemen…Apple is ..company that violated European consumer’s rights.” “They refused to reimburse me. I told them Give me my money back. They said no.” “So you know what's happening?” “This is happening.” And BAM! He smashed another iPhone with the weapon of his choice.

According to a Reuters report filed late on Friday, the verdict was handed down by a federal jury in Texas that has a reputation for awarding favorable verdicts to plaintiffs in cases involving patent infringement. The U.S. district judge presiding over the case, Robert Schroeder, previously threw out VirnetX's $625.6 million win over Apple from a previous trial because he said jurors in that case may have been confused. The case with Nevada-based patent licensor VirnetX originally began in 2010, with a jury eventually awarding the company $368 million in 2012, but that decision was thrown out in 2014 after the court decided there were problems with how the trial judge had instructed jurors on calculating damages. VirnetX continued to pursue Apple in relation to patents it believes the company infringed upon. The previous two suits were combined by the licensor's lawyers, and in February, a jury returned with an even bigger verdict, $625.6 million – one of the highest ever in a U.S. patent case. However, Schroeder later voided the result, saying that the repeated references to the earlier case could have confused jurors and were unfair to Apple. In the latest trial, reports Reuters, jurors were asked to determine damages on two VirnetX patents that Apple had already been found to infringe, and to determine both infringement and damages on another two patents. The final $302.4 million award was in line with what VirnetX had been demanding. Neither Apple nor VirnetX have commented on the latest case, although Cupertino will surely exhaust all avenues for appeals before accepting the result. In the meantime, it is facing another court proceeding over whether it willfully infinged the patents, which could lead to higher damages. Apple is also set to contend with the trial in a second lawsuit filed by VirnetX over newer versions of Apple security features, as well as its iMessage platform.

Software patents need to stop or be 3 years only unless the company has an active product and then they should be maybe 5 years. Software patents are just a dumb idea. Software copyrights are a good idea. That way people cannot steal code. Rating: 39 Votes Quu 7 weeks ago Ridiculous how high that award is.

Rating: 12 Votes kdarling 7 weeks ago So is Apple guilty of infringement of patent rights or not ... this article just talks about getting the case dismissed on technicalities related to the judicial process. It was previous high awards that had been dismissed. This trial was about redoing those awards and adding some others. How do you seek permission for vague software patents that should never be awarded and for which there is no product to compare to? No need. The patent holders approached Apple and Apple refused. So then the patent holders sued. This is pretty common, as Apple has a policy of refusing license requests and taking them to court. This isn't just some patent troll case, SAIC was a huge part of this and has actual working government level products using the tech. Yes, and most of the VirnetX officers are the actual inventors of their core patents. They're not what most people consider patent trolls. Yeah, it is amazing how many patent cases are handled there. Plaintiffs like East Texas and Delaware courts because they are quick, have technical experience, and favor patent holders. In a similar way, Apple prefers northern California courts which favor home state companies and seemingly, their lawyers' style. Likewise, Motorola used to favor filing in their home state of Illinois. Rating: 10 Votes LordVic 7 weeks ago And for all those crying foul about patent trolls I do hope you realize that Apple is part of a large consortium of patent trolls. They are one of the founding members of "RockStar COnsortium" whose primary motivation is to purchase existing patents to use in either defense or litigation. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockstar_Consortium so lets get off the "Patent troll" high horse and look at this case with more factual, and objective lenses. A legal patent holder had a patent awarded. Apple used technologies that infringed on patent. When the patent holder came asking for a license deal, Apple told them to go away, but continued to use the technology. That company had to sue in order to protect their legal rights as a patent holder. Apple lost. At the end of the day, Apple could have avoided this by doing one of two things. Change the technologies they were using to not infringe, OR pay the license fee. INstead they chose to purposefully and willfully infringe on the patent, and forced VirnetX to sue them.

Apple loses patent case to VirnetX for FaceTime's video technology The iPhone maker is likely to face another round of court proceedings for this case. By Agamoni Ghosh October 1, 2016 09:27 BST Apple has been found guilty of infringing a patent related to using VirnetX's security technologyReuters Apple has been ordered to pay more than $302m (£233) for infringing patents belonging to VirnetX Holding Corp. The iPhone maker has been found guilty of using VirnetX's internet security technology in features like FaceTime. The verdict is a let-down for Apple for a case that has been going on since 2010. At first the jury ruled that Apple owed more than $600m to VirnetX, but in August 2016 an appeals court threw the ruling out, saying jurors may have been confused. The latest verdict was handed out by the Eastern District of Texas court, which has gained a reputation for favouring plaintiffs that allege infringement in patent cases, reports say. Both Apple and VirnetX have not issued any statement post the order but Bloomberg reports that Apple is likely to face another round of court proceedings. The court will try to determine whether Apple wilfully infringed the patents and if found guilty, the company could face much higher damages. VirnetX has also filed another patent infringement case against Apple over other security features that include the iMessage application. VirnetX was founded by former employees of government contractor SAIC Inc, and most of its developed technology stems from work done for the CIA for developing secure communications. In fact, the company has been unsuccessful in marketing its own software and mostly relies on patent licensing for revenue. It has only about 20 employees, both part-time and full-time, and got its last payout from Microsoft Corp amounting to $23m.

The money relates to consultancy, legal fees and associated costs which have mounted up since the EU began its Apple state aid investigation three years ago. But Finance Minister Michael Noonan says he expects that legal costs will increase further, following Ireland’s decision to appeal the EU’ ruling that Apple owes Ireland €13bn in unpaid taxes. Details provided to Labour’s Joan Burton show the level of legal costs so far accumulated since the Competition Directorate of the European Commission first launched its probe into Apple. “Over the past three years approximately €1m has been spent in total. This includes all legal costs, consultancy fees and other associated costs. These have been paid by the Department of Finance, the Revenue Commissioners, the Attorney General’s Office and the Chief State Solicitor’s Office,” said Mr Noonan. The commission earlier this month announced that it had issued a negative decision in the Apple state aid case. The Government disagrees with the Commission’s analysis and is now challenging the decision before the European Courts. Mr Noonan, though, has said that an unknown amount of money will be provided for the legal challenge. “This is a legal process that could take several more years to conclude. It is therefore not possible to provide a comprehensive estimate of expected further expenses at this time. As it is an important issue for the State, the case will continue to be appropriately resourced,” he told Ms Burton in the written parliamentary reply. The Government say that the challenge is necessary to defend Ireland’s tax system and to provide certainty for businesses. There is also a belief at Government level that the ruling was an encroachment of EU state aid rules into member state taxation rules. Some opposition TDs argue Ireland has acted as a “tax haven” for companies.

By Mark Jones, Komando.com charnsitr / Shutterstock.com Apple launched the iPhone 7 models in early September. They're faster, shinier versions of their predecessors. A couple of major changes include the elimination of the headphone jack and the iPhone 7 Plus model has a spectacular dual-lens camera. Tim Cook even showed off some of the great photos taken with it. Well, can you believe that there are already rumors circulating about the iPhone 8? It's true! Because the 10th anniversary of the iPhone is in 2017, Apple is expected to pull out all of the stops to come up with its best smartphone ever. An anonymous employee at an Apple site in Israel where iPhone 8 hardware is being developed, has leaked details about the new gadget. The employee told "Business Insider" that the iPhone 8 will have a completely different look than previous models. Rumored iPhone 8 features Better camera - As usual, the next iPhone is said to come with a better camera than those on older models. Edge-to-edge OLED display - Interest in OLED screens is likely due to the fact that they are thinner than standard LED options, and can produce crisper colors. This makes them ideal for creating an enhanced user experience while allowing the manufacturers to continue producing thinner phone models. Curved edges - The iPhone 8 could be cased in curved glass that is made from liquid metal. No home button - Apple's 3D Touch technology along with a new TouchID scanner embedded under the screen could eliminate the need for the home button. Apple's normal schedule is to release a new model, and then an "S" version of that model the following year. Since 2017 is the 10th anniversary, it's expected to bypass the iPhone 7s and jump right to the iPhone 8. Keep checking back with our Happening Now section for more rumors and updates.

Eighty-five years later school children wear GPS watches and their parents are using their own wrist watches for so much more than simply telling time. What’s New? As technology catches up with fantasy, the latest and greatest gadgets, cellphones, rides and technology seem to fit naturally into a never-ending quest to power productivity, improve health, answer the need for speed, save time, stay safe, live healthy lives and have fun doing it. A majority of the “must have” gadgets are centered around improving already busy lives. Fortunately for everyone, there are plenty of new products to make life easier, safer and less stressful. “Technology is embedded into our every day experiences at a much faster rate than ever before,” said Krista Bourne, president, Verizon South Central Market. “We become reliant on the latest and greatest as soon as it hits the market. With so many options available, it’s easy to find something that fits your lifestyle.” Better Time Management The busier we are, the more we feel the need for tools and tricks that boost productivity and aid organization – and there are lots of options. The Apple Watch was the center of attention when it was released in April 2015. Now smart watches accompany smart phones, from Samsung to Moto. The age old wrist watch was declining in popularity as new generations looked to their phones to tell the time. However, with the advent of connected watches, the wrist accessory has made a comeback now that it allows wearers to track appointments, send and receive emails and text messages, consult their calendars and pay for lunch. The fashion component – size, color, style – isn’t lost on users, nor is the ability for parents of young children to track their offspring with the kid’s GizmoPal watch, complete with GPS and limited calling ability. Fitbit and other fitness bands have also soared in popularity and now offer watch options. Different bands have different functions, including GPS, step, mile and heart rate tracking, as well as tracking sleep habits. Sleep tracking functions allow users to track when they’re getting their best sleep. For Jaimesen Mapes, director of marketing, Town Square, that allows him to work in the evening, aware that his best sleep is after midnight, so he can be productive at night without sacrificing rest. “There’s a lot more technology out there, more than ever before, that allows you to spend more time doing what you want to do as opposed to what you have to do,” said Mapes. By way of example, Mapes uses the Apple Pen Tool to edit creative content, get proofs from advertising, make corrections, changes and additions directly to documents. “To me, that’s awesome. Not only better for the environment because I don’t have to print anything, but it frees up time I can use to do other things,” said Mapes. When time is of the essence, many executives have oft wished for the ability to be in two places simultaneously. Well, now they can. Apple’s Double 2 Telepresence Robot looks a bit like someone integrated Apple’s FaceTime with a Segway. “Imagine a business executive using that if they’re doing a lot of overseas stuff or long distance conferences, or having fun with their teams. It’s a way to have a presence at all meetings where they need to be,” said Greg Eroe, general manager, The Summit Reno. One time-saving trend that may be unique to Town Square is a salon for male grooming that offers a subscription service. For $49 a month, men can get as many haircuts and trims as they want, along with manicures and pedicures. No need to make an appointment that just has to be rescheduled if something comes up. Creative solutions such as these are part and parcel to the changing times and, while the concepts are sometimes simple, the execution is revolutionary. In many cases, consumers have proven to be willing to pay slightly higher fees for the convenience these new services can offer. Futuristic Home Security Technological “must haves” include innovations that can keep even the busiest life running on time, with organization and safety. New technology in smart homes, for example, can free people up to do more of what they want to do, rather than what they have to do, while providing the freedom to leave home knowing everything is safe and secure. For those who want to monitor school age children who are home alone, there are programs that connect with smart phones and allow users to view the house inside and out: check on the dog in the yard, the kids in the house and track deliveries coming to the front door. Trusted service providers can be given a temporary security code to enter and perform work, without the home owner needing to change all the security codes afterwards. Smart homes aren’t one size fits all. Technology now allows connectivity between devices so a smart phone can connect with a camera security system and features that control lighting, thermostats, door locks, window treatments. Active Outside of the Office In terms of items flying off the shelves of shops inside Town Square, there’s a trend toward fast fashion: people buying what they’ll wear to go out that night, and buying based on fit and feel rather than fashion and label. Another type of fast fashion seen at The Summit is a line of menswear button down shirts and dress slacks created from fabrics that allow them to double as yoga clothes. Imagine going to a business meeting in dress slacks and heading out immediately after to yoga class. For those heading out to ski, mountain bike or run, who want to record their athletic endeavors, the DJI Phantom 4 camera drone will record it all. Throw the drone up into the air and it will follow, creating a video – your own personal paparazzi that you can easily switch on or off. Other personal fitness items range from wireless blood pressure scanners to fitness apps, each designed to help users live healthier lives. KitchenAid is coming out with a line of blenders that rival the Vitamix for the health-conscious who want to mix healthy smoothies. For those heading out into nature, Orvis has come out with the Helios 2, a feather light fly fishing rod with the strength of an I-beam, a steel beam used in civil engineering and construction for their strength and stability. The Suunto Ambit GPS watches, another iteration of the fitness watch, include two models, one for tracking speed, pace, distance and elevation gain for runners, and another for sports like kayaking, mountain and road biking. What About the Flying Cars? When drones aren’t being flung into the air to follow athletics or busy delivering packages for Amazon, they may someday, in the not too distant future, be carrying humans. This past January, at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, a Chinese company called Ehang presented 184, a drone equipped with a pod capable of carrying a human. So far the range isn’t great – battery life lasts about 10 miles or 23 minutes – but the cool factor arises from the ability to use a smart phone and an app to program an autonomous aerial vehicle to transport a human. Tom Wilczek, Nevada Governor’s Office of Economic Development (GOED) industry specialist in aerospace and defense, spoke with the Ehang COO about eventually flying the 184 in the United States – and testing in Nevada. Ehang and GOED were able to execute an agreement in principle to work together through the Federal Aviation Administration’s (FAA) testing and licensing requirements. “The key parameter of the 184 is that you don’t have to be a pilot,” said Wilczek. Step into the comfortable, padded interior, plug in your iPad and the app comes up. GPS knows where you are – you provide your destination. “You don’t have to pilot [the drone].” Which is both good and bad in the FAA’s view. All of the technology already exists to operate the 184. It’s the licensing and regulatory concerns that will take time as the FAA looks at completely new modes of transportation. Human pilots have to be certified. Certification for technology is at least already being considered via the small unmanned aerial vehicles already testing in Nevada. Flying on Land So when can the general public take a ride in a drone? Not quite yet; the FAA still needs to test, license and regulate. But there are different ways of flying. Like keeping a vehicle on the ground, and going fast. New luxury cars are creating turbo engines that are more powerful, fuel efficient and have lower carbon emissions that are environmentally friendly, said Carolynn Towbin, chairman/dealer principal, Towbin Automotive. They’ve also got improved driver handling with updated electronics for traction, braking and anti-slip control. “And we’re talking about that because when mentioning features with high performance cars like Ferrari, what people are most interested in is increasing horsepower and under three second zero to 60 acceleration,” said Towbin. “These are people really interested in the performance of the car. They want to go 400 miles per hour.” So how does a driver stay safe in a high performance car capable of doing 200 miles per hour plus? Technology helps. All models of Ferrari come with Apple CarPlay, which connects the iPhone’s functions with the car’s built-in display to provide functionality without significant distraction. Ferrari is also integrating racing technology with street performance to produce a combination of electronic traction, handling, braking and safety features among the most advanced in the industry. That’s a good thing, considering the newest Ferrari model, the GTC4Lusso which features four-wheel drive, four-wheel steering and the capability of going 218 miles per hour. Don’t feel like doing the driving? Autonomous vehicles are being tested in Nevada and a newcomer to the scene, Faraday Future, broke ground on its Southern Nevada plant in April. A spokesperson for the company said principals see an incredible opportunity to deliver a new age of mobility driven solely by electric vehicles, with autonomous functionality, seamless connectivity and electric range being the key features driving demand for such vehicles. Faraday Future vehicles will be autonomous ready, electric vehicles with extreme technology capable of such things as alerting the driver before a trip to traffic issues and alternative routes, and determining preferences within the vehicle based on use. Make Time for Fun Aside from the productivity enhancements of technology wearables, the safety features provided by smart homes and the exciting changes to transportation, entertainment options are also getting an upgrade. While movies and shows aren’t disappearing anytime soon, new options for downtime are opening all the time. One of the newer offerings is Top Shot Las Vegas, a non-lethal simulated shooting experience for locals, tourists, executives and families – pretty much everybody. The facility is unique in that it’s more than a classic gun range, and users learn about gun safety and handle actual guns and assault rifles with specially made non-lethal rounds making the experience safe for even those new to weapon handling. Top Shot provides corporate team building opportunities and offers everything from simulated shooting with zombies to training for law enforcement. Parent company Ultimate Training Munitions or UTM, originally produced non-lethal ammunition for military training use, the most realistic training possible without live ammo. Military and law enforcement can use the technology to learn how to clear a room, go through a shoot out, address an active shooter or a robbery scenario, with a gun that operates like live fire with shell ejection, recoil and simulated noise. The projectile is safe – a laser – and results register on a screen. “We’ve found some of the major security people in Las Vegas come down and want to try it out,” said Fergus Connon, director, Top Shot Las Vegas. “They plan to use the facilities to train their personnel because it’s the closest reality can get to the real situation.” Another, possibly less intense range experience, depending on who you go with, is the newly open facility, Topgolf. “Topgolf is a driving range mixed with an elevated entertainment experience,” said Gilbert Medina, A/V manager. Where typical driving ranges are all about hitting a ball into the outfield, Topgolf features specific games and microchip-equipped golf balls that track how close players come to specific targets. In the signature game, players score by hitting microchipped balls into any target, and there’s more than one way to play. Team building and corporate events can reserve meeting rooms and golf bays. From fun to functionality today’s toys and technologies may be gadgets, cars or apps, but they share a sense of longing for “seamless connectivity” between health and fitness, safety and speed, productivity and fun and busy work and home lives.

Any OLED supply agreement would depend on the Osaka-based company’s output capacity, said the person, who asked not to be identified because talks aren’t public. The discussions stem from Apple’s desire to increase the number of suppliers for OLED screens, according to the person. Earlier yesterday, Sharp announced it will invest ¥57.4 billion (US$566 million) for the development of OLED production facilities, with the goal of starting output by June 2018. The funds will be used for equipment in Sharp’s factories in Mie and Osaka, and to deliver sample products to customers, the company said in a statement. “Apple has unofficially or as a nod encouraged Sharp to go into it,” said Amir Anvarzadeh, Singapore-based head of Japanese equity sales at BGC Partners Inc., in a phone interview. “Apple’s general strategy is to increase the competition on the supply side, and dilute the risk exposure to one company.” Sharp spokesman Toyodo Uemura declined to comment on specific customers. An Apple spokesperson in Japan didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Sharp’s capital investment in OLED is part of ¥200 billion that the manufacturer had already committed to OLED technology, part of a strategic plan it adopted with new owner  Foxconn Technology Group. Next-generation screens based on OLED, or organic light-emitting diode, technology promise more vivid images and less battery drain. Yesterday’s announced investment will be for smartphone displays, a representative of Sharp said without identifying specific customers. “This investment is in response to what Apple is doing,” said Hideki Yasuda, an analyst at Ace Research Institute in Tokyo. “Production isn’t likely to begin until the second half of 2018, so the impact to profit won’t be until after that.” Sharp shares rose as much as 2.2 per cent after the announcement, but closed unchanged yesterday in Tokyo. The stock has climbed 8 per cent this year, compared with the broader market’s 15 per cent decline. Apple accounts for about 27 per cent of Sharp’s revenue, according to Bloomberg’s supply chain analysis. Earlier this year, the Japanese company agreed to accept a rescue package from Foxconn Technology Group, ending a takeover battle that spanned four years. Last month, the company said its liabilities no longer exceed assets after receiving a ¥289 billion infusion. — Bloomberg                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Facebook fake news writer on how he possibly influenced the US election Pushing the limits of science at the first Cyborg Olympics (VIDEO) Soar above the planet’s most spectacular sights with Google Earth VR (VIDEO) Udacity, an online learning startup, offers tech job trials How Twitter, Instagram and Facebook are stepping up measures to fight online abuse (VIDEO) Sony’s PS3 celebrates 10-year anniversary WhatsApp joins rivals from Snapchat to WeChat in video calls Facebook accidentally declares some users dead, including founder Zuckerberg Tinder launches transgender-inclusive update, allowing users to select personalised gender identity (VIDEO) Best smartphones for holiday 2016 Most Watched Now Week Neil Patrick Harris stars as Count Olaf in trailer for ‘A Series of Unfortunate Events’ Bloomberg Video: Resurrecting Jaguar’s legendary XKSS supercar ‘Fantastic Beasts’ of the TSA with James Corden, Eddie Redmayne Ah Beng reviews iguana’s epic escape from snakes (WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE) Did you know: The ocean is way deeper than you think Reuters Video: Thailand sinks boats to tackle illegal fishing Related Articles Singapore police: Bogus online ads offering S$1 iPhones Three iPhones may be coming next year, analyst claims Nintendo to release first iPhone Super Mario game Hong Kong jury views ‘torture’ video in Jutting murder trial British murder accused ‘filmed victims’ in Hong Kong Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2016 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

Minyanville 4 Best ETFs and Stocks to Tap the Tech Boom By Scutify Sep 30, 2016 9:32 am PRINT   Stay Connected This article is published in collaboration with Scutify, where you can find real-time markets and stock commentary from Robert Marcin, Cody Willard and others. Download the Scutify iOS App, the Scutify Android App or visit Scutify.com. After a lackluster first half of 2016, the technology sector is on fire in the third quarter on improving fundamentals, investors' drive for cheaper valuation and renewed focus on beaten down growth stocks. In fact, the sector led the market rally in Q3, with the ultra-popular Technology SPDR (XLK) gaining nearly 10.5% versus the gain of 3.4% for SPDR S&P 500 (SPY). Inside the Tech Surge Impressive growth of the sector largely hinges on Apple Inc.'s(AAPL) solid performance led by robust earnings and the iPhone 7 launch. The flurry of better-than-expected Q2 results from heavyweights such as Microsoft Corporation (MSFT), Alphabet Inc(GOOGL), Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN), and Facebook Inc (FB) also injected optimism, pushing the sector to new highs. Ongoing consolidation in the semiconductor industry and strong earnings reports from chipmakers Intel Corporation (INTC), Qualcomm, Inc. (QCOM), Texas Instruments Incorporated (TXN), and Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) added further strength (read:Catch Apple's Rally with These Top-Ranked Tech ETFs). In fact, the sector has staged a strong turnaround from the two previous quarters of negative earnings and even surpassed the S&P 500. The trend is likely to continue in the third quarter as the sector's earnings are expected to decline 1.9%, much lower than that of the S&P 500's decline of 3.1%, as per the Earnings Trend report. The expectation of outperformance in Q3 continues to fuel the rally in the sector. Additionally, a strengthening economy and better job prospects gave a nice boost to economically sensitive growth sectors like technology that typically perform well in a maturing economic cycle. As the world is becoming increasingly digital, demand for novel and advanced technologies such as cloud computing, big data, smartphones, high-speed fiber networks and the Internet of Things is growing by leaps and bounds. This is creating great opportunities for tech companies. And not to forget, most of these tech companies are sitting on a huge pile of cash and are in a position to increase payouts to their shareholders. 10 Growth Stocks That Will Outrun Google The cash reserves will ensure that these companies are not plagued by financial trouble even in a rising interest rate environment, the chance of which is looming large for later this year (read: Time to Buy These Tech ETFs?). While most of the ETFs and stocks have outperformed in Q3, we have highlighted four from each corner of the space that will continue their outperformance in the coming months as well. Let's take a look at our ETF picks first... Using our database, we have selected those technology ETFs that offer domestic exposure and have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Each of these has the potential to move higher in Q4 as well (see: all the Technology ETFs here). PowerShares Dynamic Networking (ETF) (PXQ) - Up 22.6% This product targets the networking segment of the broad U.S. technology sector by tracking the Dynamic Networking Intellidex Index. Holding 30 securities in its basket, the fund is well spread across each component as each security accounts for less than 5.1% share in the basket. From an industrial look, about half of the portfolio is focused on communication equipment followed by 30% in software and programming. The fund is unpopular and illiquid in the broad tech space with AUM of $19.9 million and average daily volume of about 3,000 shares. It charges 63 bps in annual fees and has a Zacks ETF Rank of 1 with a High risk outlook. Global X Funds (SOCL) - Up 21.7% This fund provides pure play access to social media companies around the world and follows the Solactive Social Media Total Return Index. It has amassed $132 million in its asset base and charges 0.65% in fees and expenses. The ETF sees a lower trading volumes of roughly 48,000 shares a day. In total, it holds 31 securities in the basket with higher concentration on the top four firms making up for a combined 39% share. U.S. firms take half of the portfolio, closely followed by China (26%), Japan (8%) and Russia (6%). The fund has a Zacks ETF Rank of 3, with a High risk outlook (read: Twitter Acquisition Talks in the Air: Stock & ETFs Gain). PowerShares Dynamic Semiconductors (ETF) (PSI)- Up 21.5% This ETF provides exposure to the semiconductor segment of the broader U.S. technology sector by tracking the Dynamic Semiconductor Intellidex Index. This benchmark selects stocks on a variety of investment criteria: price momentum, earnings momentum, quality, management action and value. In total, the fund holds a small basket of 30 securities with none holding more than 5.2% share. The product, with AUM of $92.7 million is often overlooked by investors and hence sees a lower average daily volume of around 23,000 shares. The product charges a fee of 63 bps a year and has a Zacks ETF Rank of 1, with a High risk outlook. Market Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) - Up 18.3% This fund provides exposure to 26 chipmakers by tracking the MVIS US Listed Semiconductor 25 Index. It has a large concentration on the top two firms that collectively make up for 26.1% of assets. The product has managed assets worth $567.4 million and charges 35 bps in annual fees and expenses. It is heavily traded with volume of around 2.7 million shares per day and has a Zacks ETF Rank of 2, with a High risk outlook (read: Profit from the Semiconductor Rally with These ETFs).

We narrowed down the list by selecting stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, a VGM Style Score of A or B, and market cap of above $2 billion.

Irvin email print Sign Up for GamenGuide's Newsletter and never miss out on our most popular stories. iPad Pro is considered as a device that is close to a MacBook when it comes to performance. (Photo: Getty Images/Justin Sullivan) The upcoming iPad Pro 2 is rumored to be made available in three variants. The new Apple tablet is said to sports revolutionary specs and features, which include the A10 chipset, Apple Pencil, as well as AMOLED display panel. After a no-show at IFA 2016 in Germany, it is believed that the tablet might be released in March 2017 instead. According to HNGN,  the eventual 2017 release date was also hinted by Ming Chi-Kuo, who is a famous tech analyst. She stated that the Cupertino-based technology giant is very eager with regard to the integration of more impressive specs to the second installment of the iPad Pro unit. Rumors suggested that the three variants of the iPad Pro 2 will be composed of a different screen size, which include 12.9-inch, 10.5-inch, and 9.7-inch. More so, it is also stated that all variants are expected to be slimmer, water resistant, and lighter. According to Bloomberg, the new Apple tablet will also sport AMOLED display technology. Should the Ipad Pro 2 be made available next year, it is expected to come with the Apple pencil for more convenient and efficient writing and drawing. As stated in the same report, the pencil will help users to smoothly navigate through the unit with fluid panning, zooming, and scrolling features. Apart from that, it is also rumored that the table might be lacking a headphone jack and feature the Apple Airpods, which is the same with the recently launched iPhone 7 and 7 Plus units. Performance-wise, reports claim that both 12.9-inch and 10.50-inch variants will be powered by the latest A10X processor while the 9.7-inch will be equipped with an A9X chipset. Moreover, the basic variant of the iPad Pro 2 is rumored to have 32GB of internal storage option.
