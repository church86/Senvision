While the release date of the device remains unknown as of now, speculations are high that the next powerhouse tablet from the Cupertino-based tech giant would make its debut within the next couple of months. The original iPad Pro was designed to be a portable device that is capable of replacing a full-fledged laptop computer. However, a limited suite of enterprise-driven apps and clunky accessories ultimately caused the first-generation iPad Pro to fall short of its goal. It was a successful tablet in its own right, but it remained no more than that. Things appear to be different this time around, however, as Apple is gearing up to release a successor to its powerhouse tablet, the iPad Pro 2. With this in mind, here are three notable features that the iPad Pro 2 must have if Apple would like to finally take a decisive crack at the productivity-centered enterprise market. Proud to show you my vision of next #ipadpro2 concept ! ???????? #ipad #ipadpro #photoshop #apple #design #jetblack #creativity #visionary ???????? pic.twitter.com/SZVB1Yvfcu —  Philippe Legrand (@picsigndesign) March 3, 2017 An Updated, High-Res Screen The displays in the current iterations of the iPad Pro are already stellar. Featuring Apple’s iconic Retina Display, the screens of the devices are eye-catching and definitely of premium quality. However, the resolution of the displays, especially the 9.7-inch iPad Pro, is the same as the resolution that debuted in the iPad 3 almost five years ago, according to a TechRadar report. Thus, while its display is still good enough for users, it would be great if Apple releases the iPad Pro 2 with a screen featuring better resolution. An improvement in quality on the screen of the iPad Pro 2 is very likely, but a bump in resolution would be even better. After all, with competitors such as the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 rumored to be equipped with admirable 4K screens, it is high time for Apple to step up its game and improve its Retina displays for the iPad Pro 2 even further. Real Multitasking, Enterprise-Grade Features The iPad Pro 2 is a device that could actually achieve what its predecessor was unable to accomplish. The original iPad Pro had enough power to do some real productivity tasks, but a limited suite of enterprise-grade apps and the subpar multitasking capabilities of iOS ultimately pulled down the device’s chances of fully breaching the business market. With the iPad Pro 2, however, Apple could address all of the previous devices’ flaws. This could be done by optimizing the iPad Pro 2 for enterprise-grade tasks and productivity. Apps that are comparable in features to those found in macOS must be made available to the iPad Pro 2, allowing users of the device to perform intricate tasks that were previously only possible on a laptop computer. Multi-window support must also be included by Apple, allowing users to simultaneously access and manipulate multiple apps on the screen, much like a desktop unit. If Apple manages to pull this off with the software of the iPad Pro 2, the upcoming device would most likely be a blockbuster hit. https://t.co/TivwJsLPCo : #iPadPro2 #iPhone7Plus – #Apple iPad Pro 2 Specs & Features: iPhone 7 Plus Dual Cameras And Much More Tipped pic.twitter.com/8yBj6na88e — SndyAaron (@SndyAaron) February 4, 2017 Better Accessories The original 12.9-inch iPad Pro and its smaller, 9.7-inch sibling are excellent tablet devices that have enough horsepower to perform like a full-fledged laptop computer. While the devices undoubtedly had potential, however, its two main accessories, the Apple Pencil and the Smart Keyboard, were inherently flawed. The Apple Pencil was huge, cumbersome, and was just plain unsightly when charging, while the Smart Keyboard was clunky and shallow at best. Thus, with the iPad Pro 2, it would be best for Apple to ensure that the device is released with accessories that are just as good as its specs. A better keyboard is already rumored for the iPad Pro 2, and speculations are also high that the Apple Pencil would see an update. If these rumors prove true, the iPad Pro 2 might actually end up as the device Apple meant it to be: a portable machine that could replace a full-fledged computer. The official release date of the iPad Pro 2 remains unknown, but speculations are high that the device would see a March, 2017, reveal, according to a MacWorld report. Pricing for the iPad Pro 2 has not been confirmed either, but considering Apple’s penchant for placing premium prices on its devices, rumors are high that the powerhouse tablet would start at $799 for the entry-level 12.9-inch version, and $599 for the entry-level 9.7-inch model.

Easiest Ways To Upgrade Your Computer Yourself David Nield Mar 6, 2017, 10:00am ⋅ Filed to:  apple dell fieldguide upgrades Share Upgrading your computer can be a great way to save a little cash. It can also be a great way to fulfil that need most gadget geeks have for getting cool new stuff on a regular basis. But upgrading can also be shockingly expensive if you're not careful (steer clear of Apple's overpriced RAM), and it can seem especially daunting to upgrade if you're not familiar with the insides of your computer. Yet there are many ways to upgrade your current setup without spending too much cash or needing a degree in computer science to tackle them. These are the DIY upgrades that will give you the most bang for your buck, and are shockingly easy to perform in an afternoon. Add more memory If the processor inside your computer determines how fast it can think, then the amount of RAM affects how much it can think about at any one time — opt for a memory upgrade and you'll be able to run more programs simultaneously and more smoothly, and you'll find larger files or multiple files are handled better too. Getting extra RAM sticks inside your machine isn't that expensive or that difficult to do, particularly if you're using a desktop computer with an extra memory slot or two free on the motherboard. Your first task is to identify what your motherboard is, and how much memory is already installed — you can either open up the case and take a look or run a diagnostics tool like CPU-Z or Apple's About This Mac to check for you. In the case of laptops the job is a lot trickier but not impossible for the casual computer user — how easy the task is can vary widely from model to model, so again you need to do some online research into the laptop you've got. As the video above from Brue Computing shows, you can do the job on a Dell laptop with a screwdriver, a plastic pry tool and a few minutes' spare time. Where possible find instructions for your exact make and model of computer, to minimise the chances of running into problems. Ifixit.com is a great resource for learning how to get into many laptops from major brands, including Dell, Apple, Samsung, and HP. Add more storage space Your computer doesn't like running out of storage space — besides losing out on a place to store that kitten video you downloaded for Youtube, you'll also find your computer runs a lot slower when the storage is nearly full. So anything you can do to keep a healthy chunk of storage space free is an upgrade that's well worth doing. Investing in an external hard drive and plugging it into a spare USB port is an upgrade that pretty much anyone can do. You won't be able to move your operating system files over to it, but you can shift all those photos, videos and other personal files to the external drive no problem. Just remember that you need to back them up somewhere else too, just in case your new external hard drive should fall into the fish tank. Fitting a second hard drive inside your case or even swapping out your original drive for a bigger one isn't as difficult as you might think, though in the latter case you have the added hassle of having to move your operating system, applications and files over at the same time. If you do decide to replace your internal hard drive, than switching from a mechanical hard drive to a speedy SSD can make a huge difference to the load times and running speed of your computer, as well as potentially giving you more storage space too. The comprehensive video above from Babbling Boolean is a great introduction to the process of adding an SSD drive to your system (and you can see the before and after speed difference too). The process is easier if you're working with a desktop computer with large hard drive bays but you can made the switch on most models of laptops too. Upgrade your input options Image: Alex Cranz/Gizmodo You may not think that buying a new mouse and keyboard is much of an upgrade for your computer, but you use these devices constantly, and buying new kit can feel like upgrading your whole machine (even though all the internal components are exactly the same). There are a lot of options out there and you don't need to spend much to get something of great quality. You could consider investing in a mechanical keyboard for a more pleasing typing experience or a dedicated gaming keyboard for all those FPS games you play. On the mouse side, upgrading to a model with more switches and options gives you access to more instant shortcuts — whether that's for Excel or No Man's Sky. Installation and setup can be done in seconds and then you're ready to go. For those who aren't particularly concerned with computer performance, or who already have computers that are running top-notch components, focusing on the devices you use to interact with your system is an upgrade path well worth considering. Buy a new (or second) display Image: Samsung As with keyboards and mice, adding a new display doesn't change anything about the core specs of your computer, but it can make the experience of using it a whole lot better. There are a couple of options here: upgrading to a bigger display from your original one or adding a second monitor. Both can make a big difference, letting you run programs side-by-side, or keep one app open constantly on one screen while you work on another. If you've never considered setting up a secondary monitor before, take our word for it that it's a lot more useful than you might realise: web browsing, office apps, playing music and video, all these tasks benefit from extra screen real estate, whether that's more room on one monitor or a second one available to the OS. And the upgrade is about as easy as they come as long as you can plug in both ends of an HDMI cable and find a power socket. If you're adding a second monitor then you need a desktop or laptop capable of powering two displays (most can), otherwise you can simply swap out one monitor for another and you're ready to go. However you set up your displays, both Windows and macOS should detect the changes instantly.

Customers in Austria, Italy, and Singapore can now use mobile phone billing with select carriers where available. Sony A6500 Mobile phone billing lets customers roll charges for the iTunes Store, App Store, iBooks Store, and Apple Music memberships into monthly phone bills from the carrier as an alternative to storing debit or credit cards with Apple. These carriers work with mobile phone billing in each new country: Drei in Austria 3 in Italy M1 Limited in Singapore You can find the full list of supported carriers in previously supported countries including Belgium, Germany, Japan, Norway, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Switzerland, Taiwan, and UAE on Apple’s support site. While the concept has been available from other companies with various carriers in the United States, Apple does not support mobile phone billing for the App Store and other services in the US.

Apple has also made some general updates to that Home-focused website. Mujjo Wallet iPhone 7 Case In the video, which is accessible from the header of the Home webpage, Apple showcases a variety of different features that the Home app offers. The ad starts with a woman waking up and asking Siri to set her morning scene and from there the “breakfast time” scene is enabled, which turns on the coffee pot and other kitchen appliances. From there, the woman adjusts the temperature in her home using the Honeywell Lyric Thermostat. The Kwikset smart lock is also showcased when the user sets the “Lock Up” scene on her way out the door. The next feature showcased is Home support on the fourth-gen tvOS Apple TV, with the woman setting the “movie time” scene, which closes the blinds and dims the lights. Last but not least, the “Lights out” scene completely turns out the lights and drops the temperature by 2 degrees. Apple has also made some slight tweaks to its Home-dedicated page on its website. The header tagline and image has been updated to read, ” Your home at your command” with a link to the short film right below it. Apple also offers up a description of the Home app’s capabilities: With the Home app, you can easily and securely control all your HomeKit accessories. Ask Siri to turn off the lights from your iPhone. See who’s at the front door on your iPad. And even control things remotely with the help of Apple TV. The Home app makes all your connected devices work harder — and smarter — for you. Furthermore, Apple has divided the page into more clear subsections, including ones for: One app for all your home accessories. Get your house in order. Room by room. Set several things in motion with a tap. Or your voice. Siri makes your voice the on/off switch. With Apple TV as your home hub, you can control your house from just about anywhere.

Skip to content 512 Pixels About Projects Sponsor Book → RSS → The Future of Target Display Mode  March 5, 2017March 5, 2017 ⌘ Permalink In the fall of 2009, Apple retired the 20 and 24-inch iMacs in favor of widescreen models with 21.5 and 27 inch displays. These machines are not the Retina models we enjoy today, and still packed things like an optical drive. They introduced Target Display Mode, which allowed a user to use an iMac as an external display for another Mac. Late 2009 and Mid 2010 models required a Mini DisplayPort cable for the feature to work. Setting it up was as simple as running a cable from the Mini DisplayPort on a MacBook Pro over to the same port on the iMac, and pressing Command-F2 on the iMac’s keyboard. In Mid 2011, Apple put Thunderbolt on the iMac, and Target Display Mode suddenly required the new connector. This setup is more familiar to most users, and many even call the feature “Thunderbolt Display Mode” mistakenly. (All of this is outlined in a single kbase article, as if you doubted my desire to link to an Apple support page in this post.) In the fall of 2014, Apple introduced the first Retina iMac, a 27-inch model with a 5K display. It did not support Target Display Mode, as Jason Snell pointed out in his review of the machine: While recent iMacs have been able to double as an external display via something called Target Display Mode, the Retina iMac can’t. This is cutting edge technology, and pumping this volume of pixels through a display cable or series of cables is a serious challenge. With the Retina iMac, Apple has punted: There’s no better way to attach a computer to a display like this than to build them together. In the future, there will undoubtedly be standalone 5K displays—even from Apple!—and ways to connect them to other Macs effectively. For now, though, the Retina iMac is an island, its own display and computer as one. When the 21.5-inch iMac with Retina 4k display shipped in 2015, it too dropped this technology. Thunderbolt 2 just couldn’t push these displays in any reliable way. In short, if you have a Retina iMac, you don’t have Target Display mode. However, that could be changing in the near future. While Thunderbolt 2 was not up to the task, Thunderbolt 3 is. Found on the new MacBook Pros — and assumedly the next iMac — this port could allow users to turn their 2017 iMacs into big, beautiful displays when needed.1 While the technology would allow Apple to do this, the company would still need to elect to re-enable it in macOS. When this topic comes up, an argument in favor of Target Display Mode I often hear goes something like this: “It can extend the life of an iMac. It the machine has a failure, you can just use it a display instead of getting rid of it!” I don’t buy this line of thinking, however. Target Display Mode may extend the life of an iMac that isn’t fast enough for the latest software, but if the machine has some sort of catastrophic component failure that keeps it from booting, Target Display Mode isn’t an option. I cannot imagine that this was a popular feature, but my guess is that people who once relied on it would like the option again. My iMac won’t support it, but in the future when its replacement and my notebook both pack Thunderbolt 3, it could prove useful from time to time. The one-port MacBook will be left out of this party. While it ships with USB-C, the port does not utilize Thunderbolt 3. The Intel chipset used in this machine does not support the more robust connection, leading to weird (and confusing) fragmentation. ↩ Post navigation ← Previous Post Next Post → New 512 T-shirt!

Todd Campbell (TMFEBCapital) Mar 5, 2017 at 12:21PM Warren Buffett is arguably the greatest investor of our time, and that makes knowing what stocks he's buying for Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A)(NYSE:BRK-B) must-know news. In the fourth quarter, Buffett added a bunch of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) to his portfolio, and recently, he told CNBC that he's spent about $20 billion of Berkshire Hathaway's cash stockpile buying these and other stocks since "a little before the election." He also revealed that his position in both Apple and airline stocks is bigger now than it was in December. Profits by the bushel After consumers opted to hold off on upgrading their iPhones, Apple shares stumbled early in 2016, and that proved to be the perfect opportunity for Berkshire Hathaway portfolio managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler to pick up shares of the electronics giant at a discount. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. Berkshire Hathaway invested $1 billion in Apple stock in the first quarter of 2016 -- a fairly modest stake for a portfolio with $150 billion under management. However, that stake climbed significantly throughout the remainder of the year, and exiting December, Berkshire Hathaway's Apple position was worth about $7.7 billion, making it Buffett's sixth biggest individual stock position.  This week, Buffett appeared on CNBC to discuss Berkshire Hathaway's performance last year, and in his conversation, he let it slip that his interest in Apple continued into this year. Although Apple was already a big holding entering this year, Buffett says he now owns 133 million shares in Apple, making it his second biggest holding. Apple's shares have rallied sharply since they first showed up in Buffett's portfolio, so it's safe to assume that Berkshire Hathaway is sitting on a nice gain on Apple's stock. He reminded CNBC viewers he could sell at any point, but I think there's reason to think he'll hold on to his Apple position for a while. Last quarter, iPhone, Mac, Apple Watch, and services sales all reached record highs, and as a result, Apple's revenue and profit finished 2016 on a high note. Revenue in its fiscal first quarter was a record $78.4 billion, up from $75.9 billion last year, and earnings per share were $3.36, up from $3.28 a year ago. Apple's management is guiding investors to expect between $51.5 billion and $53.5 billion in sales this quarter, up between 1.7% and 5.7% year over year. With operating cash flow of $27 billion allowing management to return $15 billion to investors last year through share buybacks and dividend payments, and business humming along nicely, it wouldn't be surprising if Apple returns even more money to investors this year. Growing exposure to airlines When it comes to rewarding investors with market-beating returns, airlines have a rocky history. However, an industrywide restructuring a few years ago is boosting profit, and that's making airlines some of the market's top performers. If the U.S. economy continues to strengthen, then fuller flights will help keep prices firm, and investments in fuel-efficient airplanes will drop even more money to the bottom line.  IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. In the past, Buffett has said that one way to become a millionaire is to start out as a billionaire and then invest in an airline. He doesn't seem to believe that anymore. Over the past six months, he's invested billions of Berkshire Hathaway's cash into the stock of the country's largest airline operators. As of December, Berkshire Hathaway owned 60 million shares in Delta Air Lines worth roughly $3 billion, plus he owns about $2.5 billion in Southwest Airlines, and about $2.1 billion in each of American Airlines and United Continental Holdings. Overall, Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has invested over $9 billion in airlines.  Although he didn't say exactly what airlines he's adding more to in 2017, he didn't deny that he's continuing to increase his bet on the industry. When he was asked if he's spending more money on Apple and airlines this year, he said that was a "good guess." Clearly, he thinks airline stocks are going to go up, not down, and with unemployment low and incomes rising, it's not a stretch to to think that airlines like Delta will continue to fill seats. If so, these companies could reward investors with bigger profits and, in turn, higher dividend payments. For instance, Delta Air Lines' goal is to return about 70% of its annual free cash flow to investors, and while a lot of that cash flow could be used for share buybacks, a low dividend payout ratio and cash dividend payout ratio suggest there's room to increase quarterly dividend payments, too. Currently, Delta Air Lines' dividend payout ratio -- or the percentage of earnings paid to shareholders in dividends -- is less than 12%. American Airlines and Southwest's ratios are even lower. That's pretty low when you consider that other big companies are paying out far more to investors. For example, General Electric's payout ratio is 75%.   With Warren Buffett owning a big and potentially growing position in airlines, and an opportunity for investors to pocket bigger dividend payments, it might be time to buy stock in these companies.  Todd Campbell owns shares of Apple and General Electric.

It goes without saying that this is an impressive number. Furthermore, with so many downloads and such a high rating, it is safe to say that this app is nothing short of great. To explain, 4Shared is basically a huge database in which everything, all files, are shared by its users. It may not be specifically designed for free music, but it certainly has large amounts of free music for you to download. Along with millions of music files, you can also share and download video files, images, and whatever other media which the app supports. Ultimately, 4Shared has thousands of media files in its grasp, a lot of which are great, free music files. 4shared 4shared is one of the best free music download apps for android. 4shared provides a nice user experience.

Also read: Watch free movies online Spotify Music Perhaps the most popular music-related programme in the world, Spotify has its own app form. Everyone has at least heard of Spotify, and millions of people across the globe use it as their go-to software for free music. The best part is, although it is technically a radio-streaming programme, you have complete control over what you want to listen to, unlike actual radio. SPOTIFY I personally use Spotify myself, and the reason is due to not just its huge wealth of great music, but because it is also legal and it contributes somewhat financially to the actual music artists. All things considered, this popular radio-streaming giant offers an incredible amount of free music. There are intermittent ads, but this doesn’t detract from Spotify’s quality and wealth of free, great music. Google Play Music This app, designed by Google, is essentially a free radio service.

It seems like it has compatible with all the versions. YouTube Music We all know YouTube. This app, however, is a tiny bit different to the great website. With this app, you get “A YouTube built just for music”. Basically, this form of YouTube cuts out the non-music videos, leaving you with only the music. There are ads just like the actual website, but it’s worth the short ads to use this great app. With this app you can also create personalised stations which will adapt to your likes over time.

You can now download the Napster app for your phone and receive its free, great music, just like it once provided. Unlike most music-related apps and players, Napster has no irritating ads. Furthermore, you can listen to your music offline. Basically, with Napster, you can listen to your favourite playlist when travelling to work, without being interrupted by ads. Finally, the Napster app at the moment has been downloaded around 70,000 times. All things considered, although Napster is back in a new way, it still greatly delivers like its old ways.

Rock My Run Are you perhaps interested in fitness? Does your week consist of regular workouts? If so, Rock My Run has been specifically designed for you. This app is manufactured for those who love to listen to music during workouts. Some of the best features about this app is that you can create some unique playlists. For example, you can make playlists which are moulded around a certain tempo or mood. If you wanted to create a fast playlist for running, for example, or an inspiring playlist for hill climbing, Rock My Run is the app for you. All in all, this app will certainly motivate you in the gym or in the great outdoors. ROckmyrun is an amazing free music app for fitness training app. You can hear your favourite music while running, jogging or exercising. You can hear some popular DJ’s with perfect beats for training. It will increase your confidence and enthusiasm and will motivate you to keep going. You just need to choose your favourite genre and then it will stream body driven music. I would really prefer his app as I am personally a sportsperson. Rock My Run Has been rated 4.3 stars which is amazing. Got 1 million+ downloads. Size is quite big. Finally, it’s size is 32 MB. It seems like it requires android version 4.0 or up. Furthermore, it even consumes fewer data. In conclusion, it is one of the best free music apps for android. Gaana This app is one of the most popular music apps for Hindi, Bollywood, Punjabi and other similar types of music. Most popular in India, Gaana also offers free streaming service for popular songs in English, Tamil, Telugu, Marathi, Kannada, and Malayalam. You can also browse through the charts and select your favourite tracks to listen to or place in your own personalised playlist. There are heaps of playlists on offer, ranging from collections of sad ballads to weekend party hits. Ganna: Music Ultimately, Gaana brings the best of India to your mobile phone, whilst also delivering some popular hits from the likes of David Guetta, Bruno Mars, and more. There are a recorded 10 million music tracks to choose from, as well as thousands of playlists. At present, Gaana has been downloaded more than 800,000 times according to Google Play. SoundCloud SoundCloud is a unique music programme used by millions of people and musicians for self-production. In other words, with SoundCloud, musicians everywhere are using this free platform to upload their music. Musicians everywhere are joining this free programme, and listeners everywhere likewise are tuning in to hear what common everyday people are producing. Once a music file is uploaded to SoundCloud, people from all over the world can tune in and listen to it for free. With SoundCloud, you can be either a listener or a giver of music, or both. Soundcloud is great music downloader free app. A lot of features. The enormous database of mp3 songs. Download your favourite music tracks or songs quickly from this app. Connect and share with your friend. Entirely ads free. Finally, you can download this Android app from the below link. It is an editor’s choice music downloader free app for Android. Furthermore, it has been downloaded billions of times. Sound Cloud Since it has been rated four stars, it is an amazing free mp3 download app for android. It seems like it requires Android 4.0 or up. It was last updated in June 2016. Furthermore, this free mp3 music downloader app was developed in Germany by SoundCloud. Finally, it is a fantastic music downloader free app for Android. I personally have many friends who record and upload their own music onto SoundCloud. The benefits of using SoundCloud is the fact that you can listen to undiscovered talent which the radio cannot deliver. You can listen to friends or upcoming breakthrough artists, before the music companies slap a copyright on the tracks. Of course, you won’t find top 50 artists through SoundCloud. This is why it doesn’t rank as highly on my list. Nonetheless, there is great music out there besides the popstars on the radio. Why not give it a try and perhaps you will find a local musician whose music you could love. Saavn Music & Radio Another Hindi-related app for free music downloads, Saavn is in contention for the best app for Bollywood music. Personally, I believe Gaana is a bit better, but Saavn nonetheless shouldn’t be ignored. Saavn gives pretty much everything that Gaana does, but there are some differences between the two apps. For example, with Saavn, you can also enjoy podcasts and audio programmes. By following your favourite artists, you will be notified when/if there are any updates. Saavn In addition, with Saavn you can listen to your favourite songs offline. Playlists are also in your control to create and then modify. Like Gaana, you still get the array of different music, from English to Bollywood, Hindi to Tamil. Saavn Music & Radio is proving to be quite popular, with around 750,000 downloads recorded on the Google Play site. MP3 Music Download An app as simple and effective as its title suggests, MP3 Music Downloader may not be as popular as the rest of these apps for free music downloads, but it certainly contends well. With this app, you have unlimited access to a bunch of music files, as well as unlimited music downloads. It’s all very simple with this app. Just search for the song, artist or genre you have in mind, let the app work its magic, and then begin your download. Download App You can alternatively just stream the track if you prefer. Ultimately, this app is one of the most basic music-related apps out there on the market. It has been downloaded only 8,356 times at present, but around 50% of users have rated the app a full 5 stars out of 5. Other Great Free Music Download Apps That Almost Made the Cut Apple Music From the mega power of Apple Music comes this useful app. There are approximately 30 million Apple tracks available to listen to through this app. However, I must declare early that this app is not completely free. On the other hand, if you subscribe you can use it for free for 3 months. The fact that Apple Music is not free has dropped it out of my personal top 10 apps for free music downloads. If it weren’t for this hick-up, however, Apple Music would have a fair shot at one of the highest positions on the top 10. There are thousands of playlists to go along with the huge library of 30 million Apple songs. You can create your own library of your favourite songs. Apple Music also offers regular recommendations depending on what you listen to. There are also radio stations and other audio programmes to delve within. Basically, if you don’t want to spend a penny, you can only have this app for a limited time. The Apple Music app currently holds an overall rating of 3.4 out of 5 on Google Play. Shazam I wrestled with myself for quite some time on where to put Shazam on this list. This app fully deserves a top 10 place, and 2 million people on Google Play would probably agree with that. At the present moment, Shazam has been downloaded almost 3 million times. Of these downloaders, around two-thirds of them have given Shazam the full 5 out of 5 rating. Another half a million have given the app a 4 star rating. Shazam has an overall rating of 4.4 out of 5 on Google Play. Besides these highly impressive statistics, what does Shazam have to say about itself? Apparently, top singers and celebrities like Adele and Demi Lovato are using the app for their own free music downloads. Some of the top features include: access to lyrics, identify music offline, add songs onto Spotify playlists from Shazam, and more. Shazam also uses amazing visual recognition scanning. This means if you see an album cover or poster, for example, which you want to know more about, use Shazam to scan it and the app will collect information about the music artist in question. There are many other little features which make Shazam a great free app to have. I highly recommend giving it a try, despite the fact that it has just slipped outside the top 10. Vevo In recent years, the Vevo corporation have placed their stamp on many of the biggest, most viewed music videos. Vevo is the result of the partnership between two of the giants of music distrubution: Sony Music Entertainment and Universal Music Group. From this we now have Vevo, the now-popular music video hosting service. So, what can their app do for you? This app as you may have already figured is focused solely on music videos. Due to the fact that this app deals with videos only, and not specifically free music download, it has thus crept out of the top 10 spot. With Vevo, you can watch your favourite music videos in HD and create playlists of the videos you like most. You can also favourite artists, and when a new music video is released by your favourited artist you will be notified. However, Vevo is only available in a select number of countries. The Vevo app is available in the following countries: Canada, USA, Brazil, Australia, Italy, Ireland, France, Germany, The Netherlands, UK, Spain, Mexico, Poland, and New Zealand. The app currently holds an overall rating of 4.2 out of 5 on Google Play. TuneIn Radio One of the most popular radio apps, TuneIn Radio offers an impressive 10,000 different radio stations for free. As a radio station app, it has thus fallen out of my top 10 apps for free music downloads. In addition to all this great music, you can also tune into the news, sports and weather broadcasts, as well as other radio programmes. With TuneIn Radio you can keep track of college basketball, the NFL, NBA, and the NHL. All of the radio is delivered live from the very sources. Therefore, you won’t be in complete control over what music artist or song you want to listen to. Nonetheless, you can choose a specific radio station out the thousands of quality stations on offer. Basically, TuneIn Radio sources thousands of top quality radio stations into one single app. There is an abundance of stations to choose from. The app currently holds an overall rating of 4.4 out of 5 on Google Play. Tidal This app combines high quality definition, high definition music videos, as well as valued information from music journalists. There are huge amounts of music on offer with Tidal. The app claims to offer over 40 million tracks, as well as more than 130,000 high definition music videos. As for the contributing journalists, you can try out the carefully selected playlists chosen by these musical experts. You can also read the well-crafted articles, recommendations and interviews provided by these music journalists. In addition to all this, there are no ads nor any ‘fuzzy images’. There is also an offline mode, which allows you to listen to your albums and playlists when you are out and about. The Tidal app currently holds an overall rating of 3.6 out of 5 on Google Play based on 38,653 votes. Heart Radio Again another radio app, Heart radio is a popular radio station situated in the UK. The app is plain and simple. This app is the official app of Heart Radio and thus brings the station to your device. With the app, you can also see what songs are playing next, re-listen to songs from the past week, view the top trending videos, get celebrity news, and more. Of course, this app isn’t exactly an app for free music downloads, hence why I haven’t included it in my top 10. It is, however, a good radio station nonetheless. The app currently holds an overall rating of 4.1 out of 5 on Google Play. Qello Concerts This app is quite unique. With Qello Converts, you can stream classic concerts and documentaries. This app is essentially a treasure chest full of old great live concerts which you can replay at any time. Some of the things which this app also provides are: One of more free tracks from each concert, more than 30 channels of continuous concert moments, and special free full-length shows. It may not be an app for free music downloads, but is is however an app for free music concert downloads. In addition, there are a whole bunch of award-winning music documentaries to feast your eyes and ears on. Qello Concerts currently holds an overall rating of 4.1 out of 5 on Google Play based on 23,233 user votes. Pandora Radio Unlike most radio apps, Pandora gives you complete control over what you want to listen to. With Pandora music, you can create individual stations or playlists for your favourite artists. Most Pandora apps allow you to store up to 100 different artist playlists. Once you have an artist playlist, you will be given anything by that artist on demand. Like I said, Pandora lets you create your own unique radio channels. Personally, I am a huge fan of Pandora, and it almost made its way into my top 10 favourite apps for free music downloads. You can upgrade to Pandora Plus, which will cut the ads, allow replays and skips, and offline playing. The Pandora Radio app currently holds an overall rating of 4.4 out of 5 on Google Play based on an impressive number of 2,651,882 user votes. I highly recommend this app, despite the fact I haven’t included it in my top 10. SongFlip The SongFlip app claims to offer its users the ability to stream millions of free songs online. I am unsure if there is actually millions on offer from SongFlip, but it does nonetheless offer a lot. The SongFlip app is one of the most basic apps for free music downloads. Simply search for your song or artist and begin streaming for free. There is a high chance that SongFlip has the exact song or artist that you have in mind. After all, it does claim to have millions of tracks to give. The SongFlip app currently holds an overall rating of 4.5 out of 5 on Google Play. Radio Player by Audials This app, yet another radio app, offers over 80,000 different radio stations across the USA. Simply search for an artist, a genre, song or album, and Audials will do its best to retrieve a station best suited to your search. In addition, you can record songs playing on any radio. In other words, if you hear a song which you happen to like but you don’t know the name of, you can choose to record the song right there and then. You can also connect your device to another computer belonging to you, thus allowing you to sync the selected music onto your home PC or laptop. The Radio Player by Audials app currently holds an overall rating of 4.4 out of 5 on Google Play based on 19,49 user votes. Radio Online – PCRADIO You’ve probably assumed by now that there are thousands of radio-related music apps. That assertion would be correct. However, Radio Online – PCRADIO is one of the best free radio apps out there, and the following is why. This app offers hundreds of free radio stations, which is not as many as the thousands offered by the above Radio Player by Audials, or, TuneIn Radio, for example. Nonetheless, Radio Online PCRADIO does have its own perks. With this app, you can use it even if you do have the lowest of internet speeds. Also, all the radio channels are categorised by artist and genre, making your searches easy. Furthermore, Radio Online PCRADIO also offers full discographies on several artists. The Radio Online PCRADIO app currently holds an overall rating of 4.7 out of 5 on Google Play based on 645,547 user votes. Other Great Music Downloader Apps For Free Music Downloads, and Apps Similar To Music Streaming The following apps are other apps for free music downloads. In addition there are some apps which are not quite designed to download free music. Some play music like many of the aforementioned apps and some are more unique in what they offer. SoundHound Picture yourself listening to a song, you don’t know who it’s by, and you have no way of finding out the artist. Well, these days we have SoundHound to do that for us. SoundHound can recognise voice clips, which will then generate heaps of results. You can save all your searches and import your findings into your Spotify account. The app comes with an embedded YouTube player so you can watch the music video of the found song (if there is one). You can also view the lyrics to the found song, or, if you wish, SoundHound will direct you to where you can purchase the track. There is also an abundance of information on numerous music artists to browse through. All this sounds great, but there is one snag. One version of SoundHound on the Google Play website is unfortunately not free ($3.99). On the other hand, there is another SoundHound app which is practically the exact same which is free. At the moment, I am trying to differentiate between the two apps and figure out if there is any difference. However, I can’t see any major differences, or a single difference at all. In short, search for the free version of SoundHound. This app currently holds an overall rating of 4.3 out of 5 on the Google Play website based on 623,731 user votes. Deezer – Songs & Music Player Deezer does everything that a good music app should do. One of the best features used on this app is called ‘Flow’.. Flow will suggest music based on your listening habits. You can also play unlimited playlists, tune into the radio and catch up on the news or sports, create your own playlists, and generally listen to some of the world’s leading musical icons. The Deezer app currently holds an overall rating of 4.1 out of 5 on the Google Play website. blinkbox Music A very basic app, blinkbox Music is an app specifically for android users. The app itself offers the essentials, such as unlimited streaming and a ton of free and popular hits. You can tune into top 40 playlists and other great additions. The blinkbox Music app currently holds an overall rating of 4.1 out of 5 on the Google Play website. YOUZEEK Free Music Streaming A great app which shouldn’t be ignored, YOUZEEK is offered in 16 different languages, and it has in store around 1 million music artists and 1,500 different genres to choose from. You can create and edit your own individual homepage, share playlists with friends and use the privacy settings. YOUZEEK is available in over 200 countries. The app currently holds an overall rating of 4 out of 5 stars on the Google Play website. Stingray Music This app is available for free if it is part of or related to a TV subscription which you have signed with. Stingray has around 2000 individualised music channels to select from. In total, there are around 100 different genres to browse through, and you can customise your very own channel. Stingray offers the basics of any other great free music streaming app. The app currently holds an overall rating of 4.3 out of 5 on the Google Play website. Torch Music With Torch music, you can experience all the pleasantries of listening to your favourite music without the interruption of ads. Think of Torch Music as an app similar to Spotify without the ads. You can also connect your Torch Music account with Facebook and share what you’re listening to with your friends online. The Torch music app currently holds and overall rating of 4.1 out of 5 on the google Play website. New Releases Ed Sheeran – Shape Of You Currently storming the charts across the world is the young English singer-songwriter Ed Sheeran. After a few years from his last album release, Sheeran is back from a brief break to release his new album, Divide. In the event of its release, Ed has given us two songs from his newest album, Castle on the Hill and Shape of You. Shape Of You is currently number 1 in the UK as well as other countries, and is the perfect track to ‘get down to’ in the clubs (if you haven’t already). Chainsmokers – Paris The Chainsmokers are the biggest DJ act to appear from the music scene within the past year or so, and their most recent single Paris is storming the charts. In recent weeks, these guys have produced big hits like Closer and Don’t Let Me Down. Paris has that same vibe, which has thus placed the track highly on the official charts throughout the world. The song has the same elements has other big tracks, which will make it an essentially tune on any weekend playlist. Rag’n’Bone Man – Human This rising artist is from England, and his most recent song Human is not only taking the UK charts by storm, but it also reached no.1 in several other European countries. Rag’n’Bone Man is certainly a name to remember for the future. To put a name on the genre, I would classify the song itself as Soul track with a modern touch of R & B.  This song may very well top the charts in the next few weeks, so get listening now. I Don’t Wanna Live Forever – ZAYN & Taylor Swift Zayn Malik of One Direction and pop super queen Taylor Swift have banded together to produce this song for the official Fifty Shades Darker soundtrack. The movie is set to release this week in cinemas worldwide, which should hopefully boost the song further up the charts. The song itself is well suited for the love and romance projected in the movie, so if you want some music for the upcoming Valentine’s day celebrations, this song may very well become part of your soundtrack. Little Mix – Touch Since appearing on the popular TV show The X Factor a few years back, Little Mix have gone from strength to strength. Their newest album has done quite well in the charts, and their new single, Touch, currently sits comfortably at no.4 on the UK top 40 charts. Touch blends the band’s nice girlband vocals with R & B vibes that have made them successful with earlier tracks, such as Shout Out To My Ex. Martin Garix & Dua Lippa – Scare To Be Lonely The world recognised Dj and producer, Martin Garrix teams up with female vocalist, Dua Lippa, for this big club mix. Scared To Be Lonely follows Garrix’s previous dance flavours, with big drops and catchy melodies sure to earn a place in your weekend playlist, and certain to get you pumped for the weekend parties. Stormzy – Big For Your Boots One of the biggest success stories to emerge from the London grime scene this year is Stormzy. It’s been 9 months since his last single, and now, his new single Big For Your Boots has climbed its way up the UK charts at no.8. The song is another great analysis of the working class London way of life. If you are a fan of British rap, Stormzy is an absolute must. James Arthur – Say You Won’t Let Go This young man won the coveted X Factor competition and disappeared into the shadow. Nothing was heard of James Arthur until this big single was unleashed, which shot its way up the charts. This, his first no. 1 single, is an acoustic ballad with simple love lyrics, sure to calm the heart of any romantically-seeking individual. He should be back with more similar music in the future, so keep an ear on him for the time being. Nick Jonas & Nicki Minaj – Bom Bidi Bom With the release of the new installment of the Fifty Shades franchise, Fifty Shades Darker, also comes a hot new soundtrack. Minaj and Nick Jonas from the hugely successful Jonas Brothers have teamed up to feature on the movie’s racy soundtrack. The track itself, Bom Bidi Bom, much like the movie it features on, is sure to get pulses racing and bodies moving. Ed Sheeran – How Would You Feel (Paean) Continuing from the upcoming release of his new album, Divide ÷ , Ed has just dropped yet another new single destined to do very well in the charts. The newest single, How Would You Feel (Paean) follows the same romantic vein as previous songs like Thinking Out Loud and Tenerife Sea. The song evokes the same nostalgic romances, sun rises and heartbreak which define some of Sheeran’s most popular songs. Jax Jones – You Don’t Know Me ft. RAYE Currently sitting nicely at no.4 on the UK top 40 charts is You Don’t Know Me by British DJ and producer Jax Jones, with RAYE on vocals. The track is inspired by the likes of Justin Timberlake and most other popular pop dance tracks that have dominated the charts these past few years. The song is perfect for uplifting the weekend party, setting a nice light dance atmosphere without going over the top. Dua Lipa – Be the One One artist who has really broken onto the music scene with great success recently is the beautiful singer, Dua Lipa. The singer has previously provided vocals for other chart hits, such as Scared To Be Alone by Martin Garrix, and You Don’t Know Me by Jax Jones. Dua Lipa indeed has her own material, and this upbeat track is doing quite well in the charts. She is really one to watch for the upcoming musical year and beyond. Kygo & Selena Gomez – It Ain’t Me Pop princess Selena Gomez is back with a new track set to become a big hit. The song is another tale of hardship in a relationship, and although the track has a romantic attitude, Kygo is featured to deliver the dance vibes which make it the perfect track to get your groove on. It Ain’t Me is ultimately a great blend of ballad and beat, passion and pulse, love and vibe. Lana Del Rey – Love After her hiatus, Lana Del Rey is finally back and throwing out the big tunes. Her latest track, Love, features her trademark ethereal atmospheres, smooth vocals and tender themes. Love is a passionate track which echoes the nature of her first big hits, such as Born To Die, Summertime Sadness and Video Games. Fans of her music are sure to ‘love’ her new track. Sam Hunt – Body Like A Back Road Sam Hunt, a new name that launched from the American country scene just over 2 years ago, has released an interesting mix of country and pop. The singer holds onto his country roots with the slide guitar, organ and other elements, and meshed it with a cool beat. If you’re not a fan of country music, Body Like A Back Road might make all this change for you. The Weeknd & Daft Punk – Starboy Popular rap act The Weeknd teams up with the legendary DJ duo, Daft Punk for this big track. Daft Punk provide the solid beats for The Weeknd’s flow, creating a great mix of rhythm and attitude in Starboy. This track is on route to joining another hit for The Weeknd, which is not surprising considering Daft Punk are behind the creation. Drake – Fake Love American rapper, Drake is back releasing big hits. The Online Bling singer’s new track, Fake Love, is another mastery of R & B and a solid lyrical flow. Fake Love deals with superficial relationships, and features a good beat along with some nice melodies. If you’re a fan of Drake’s music, this track is a must. Maroon 5 – Cold Adam Levine and co. are still going strong in their latest offering, Cold. The high tempo track features some house elements, along with Levine’s trademark alto voice. Cold is ultimately about a failing relationship. In addition, rapper, Future, also provides a flowing rap and some extra vocals mid-track to mix things up, creating a mesh of pop and R & B elements. Coldplay & The Chainsmokers – Something Just Like This Two of the world’s leading musical acts have teamed up to produce something quite special. The ethereal harmonies and progressions of Coldplay have beautifully meshed with the vibes and feel-good pulses of the The Chainsmokers. Something Just Like This will soon dominate radio stations and the charts everywhere, I’m almost sure of it. Calvin Harris – Slide World-recognised DJ superstar Calvin Harris is back with the big tunes. His latest single, Slide, features the good old savvy beats and rhythms that previously made the DJ such a big success. Slide has a hint of 80s funk, blended with some smooth male rap-inspired vocals and the essential big drops that’ll surely get you grooving. Imagine Dragons – Shot Imagine Dragons have enjoyed worldwide success over the past few years, and its for good reason that the American band are so popular. Their latest track, Shot, is filled with their trademark feel-good blend of pop, rock and dance. With a touch of electric guitars, blended with some synths and some strong vocals, Shot is a euphoric song that all fans of the band will surely enjoy. Katy Perry – Chained To the Rhythm Katy Perry has never really stepped out of the spotlight since her first single, I Kissed A Girl shot to no.1 all those years ago. These days the singer is back on the radio with her popular single Chained To the Rhythm. This song is doing quite well in the charts, with its catchy melodies and his forceful rhythm, it’s sure to be another pop hit for the American singer. Willie Nelson – A Woman’s Love The Red Headed Stranger is still going strong, as is evident in his most recent single, A Woman’s Love. For fan’s of Nelson and country in general, this track will be a joy. A Woman’s Love returns to the country roots of a vocalist spurned by love, accompanied by a wailing harmonica and the rest of Willie’s ingredients which open up the vistas of the western dusty roads in the mind’s eye. Rag’n’Bone Man – Skin Perhaps the biggest music star to emerge from nowhere these past few weeks is Rag’n’Bone man. His track ‘Human’ erupted onto the charts and catapulted the young singers name into the uppermost ranks of the musical world. The hits keep on coming with this man; Skin is set to also do very well in the charts. It features that similar gospel, R & B vibe that is inherent in his other tracks. This man is certainly a talent to keep an ear on. Coldplay – Hypnotised Coldplay are back, but then again, due their huge success as a band over the years, have they ever really left? Their most recent single, Hypnotised, is a continuation of their soft pop/rock sound, with a dreamy mix of piano, hypnotic guitars and Chris Martin’s high vocals. Although a new album hasn’t been scheduled for the band, I sense that a new album is in the works and coming soon. Ed Sheeran – Perfect The 25 year old pop superstar has just brought out his much anticipated new album, Divide, and the songs are proving to be big hits. Following the release of Shape of You and Castle On the Hill, two huge hits, Sheeran’s new song Perfect is another romantic hit dedicated to the new love of his life. Perfect is as romantic as it gets, and this ballad should certainly do very well in the charts over the next few weeks. Meghan Trainor – I’m A Lady Pop princess Meghan Trainor returns with another big track sure to empower ladies across the world. The singer secured some pretty big hits last year, and the big tunes keep coming from this one. I’m A Lady has hints of Beyonce, with some techno drops, R & B sazzle and powerful vocals. This song should do well in the tracks, if her past songs are anything to go by.

While it may not be anything new, an email was sent to me over the weekend that claimed to be from Apple Customer Support. The email told me that my Apple ID account had been temporarily frozen and that I needed to confirm my Apple ID account information in order to unfreeze it. The reason for the freezing is because someone apparently added or changed a contact email address on my account. So it appears someone hacked into my account and Apple is simply being the good guy and stopping the hacker in his or her tracks, but none of that actually happened, and what I merely received in my inbox was a phishing scam designed to steal my Apple ID username and password. If you’re not familiar with the term “phishing,” you no doubt at least experienced at some point during your lifetime. Phishing is when “Phishing is when a scammer poses as a legitimate company in order to acquire personal information such as your username, password, credit card details, etc. This email looks like an official email from Apple, but not entirely. There are a few ways to tell if this kind of email is a scam, and usually it only takes a few seconds. For starters, you can look at the email address of the sender. In this email it says that the email comes from an Apple.com address, which looks pretty legit, but take notice of the “via secureserver.net”. This means that the email isn’t actually coming from that Apple.com address, but rather another email address that’s masked as the Apple.com email address. Pretty sneaky on the scammer’s part. Furthermore, when you hover over any links in the email, you’ll get a small pop-up in the lower-left corner of the browser that shows you where the link takes you. If this was an official email from Apple, it would take us to an Apple.com link. However, the email that I received links to a webpage on a site called Infolktainment.com (for the record, we don’t recommend actually going there). Phishing scams are nothing new and they’ve been around for as long as the internet has existed. Apple is a heavy target, though, as it’s one of the most popular brands on Earth, so it’s fairly easy for a scammer to reach a wide selection of users by posing as Apple. Unfortunately, many users take the bait since they’re easily convinced that it’s a legitimate email, and they end up having their iTunes account hacked into. The next time you get one of these emails, simply just mark it as spam so that similar emails don’t show up in your inbox again. Instead, they’ll be sent straight to your spam folder. Of course, scammers always find ways around this, like sending phishing emails from different email addresses so that they still make their way to your inbox. This can be pretty frustrating, but the more you send these kinds of emails to your spam folder, the more you’re knocking them down one at a time. It’s also important to make sure that you give your Apple ID account a strong password with a mixture of letters and numbers in order to make it difficult to crack. And obviously never give out your Apple ID password to anyone, unless they’re a trusted friend or a family member. 6 Responses 10/18/2014 Cree Reply Your website is the best 10/18/2014 Cree Reply The best 02/16/2015 Pramod Reply Make apple id 06/01/2015 Rick Hyne Reply Unless you have initiated the email by some method such as a password reset, NEVER respond to ANY email requesting you perform an action. Ask yourself why I might be getting an email for a service I use that has advised me of a change. Did I forget to change my expired credit card information. If so, log-in to the service as you would normally do. NEVER respond to a link in an email. There is no end to various attempts to scare people into giving up their personal information, to provide access to their accounts or computer. This also goes for inbound phone calls. 02/24/2017 Suzanne Swenson Reply apple1@dontyougiveupnow.com – definitely seems like a scam e-mail: Apple Dear Apple User, Thank you for choosing Apple .

Rather, the self-driving space is left to contend with legal hurdles, in addition to the likes of technological and regulatory issues. It is currently speculated that the earliest self-driving ventures could come to fruition is 2020. With the legal monkey on its back, will the schedule be pushed back? Technology Companies Give Up Go-Alone Approach After high profile launches, with the promise to commercialize self-driving cars, tech companies such as Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) have slowly and steadily realized the challenges to diversify into hardware. After Google spun off its self-driving venture into a standalone company called Waymo, it has signaled that it will stick to its strength of supplying the technological expertise, while leaving the hardware part to traditional automakers. Related Link: Automakers Eye The Finish Line in Sprint To Rollout Driverless Vehicles Confidentiality Breached These companies are now facing challenges from unexpected quarters. A few of them have initiated legal proceedings, alleging theft of intellectual property, specifically by former employees, who breached confidentiality clause. Google's ‘Et Tu, Brute' Moment Google's Waymo filed a lawsuit in a California federal court last Thursday, alleging that Anthony Levandowski, a former manager at Waymo had downloaded more than 14,000 proprietary and confidential files, including the lidar, Light Detection and Ranging, circuit board. Levandowski quit Google in January 2016 and later formed Otto LLC in May 2016 — a company intended to develop hardware and software for autonomous vehicles. Otto was subsequently acquired by Uber Technologies for $680 million. Waymo's lawsuit alleges unfair competition, patent infringement and trade secret misappropriation. "Instead, Otto and Uber have taken Waymo's intellectual property so that they could avoid incurring the risk, time, and expense of independently developing their own technology," Waymo said in the complaint. The lawsuit doesn't look like without merit, as Waymo took seven years to design the lidar circuit board, while Uber reportedly did it in nine months. Google was also involved in another lawsuit, which it filed last December, against a former employee for breaching the contractual obligations concerning possession and use of confidential information, when he went on to work for a start-up called Drive.ai. Tesla Also In Legal Tangle Meanwhile, in a separate development, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) has sued its former autopilot director. In a lawsuit filed with the Superior Court of California, Santa Clara, the case reads in part, "This dispute arises out of the efforts of [redacted] [...] to violate his contractual and other obligations to Tesla by attempting to recruit at least a dozen Tesla engineers, taking Tesla's confidential and proprietary information, and doctoring and destroying evidence in an effort to cover his tracks — all for the benefit of a competing venture he launched while still a Tesla employee." The formal complaints raised in the case, however, are verbatim: Breach of contract. Breach of duty of loyalty. Aiding and abetting breach of duty of loyalty. Intentional interference with contractual relations. Intentional interference with prospective economic advantage. Violation of Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 17200. With huge stakes involved in IP, it is not without rhyme and reason, these technology giants have opted to fight it out in the courts.

By Christopher Morris on March 5, 2017 12:00 pm in Technology ShareTweetPostFlip Four big mobile releases are due from the two major players in the marketplace before the end of 2017. Apple will release two iPhone units under the iPhone 8 moniker, with an iPhone 8 Plus variant accompanying the standard iPhone 8 smartphone. Meanwhile, the Galaxy S8 from Samsung will arrive in the next few weeks, followed later this year by the Galaxy Note 8. All four devices promise different qualities, while there are particular reasons why we should expect something outstanding from each individual handset. Image Credit: Samsung Display via YouTube (Screen grab) Galaxy S8 The Galaxy S8 is arguably the most important mobile release in the history of Samsung, as it must follow on the back of the most disastrous release in its history. The exploding Galaxy Note 7 has cast a shadow over Samsung for several months, particularly after the Korean Company was forced to pull the plug and completely recall the handset. In the media furore which followed, Android fans patiently awaited the next release from Samsung, and this is now imminent with the Galaxy S8. Usually there are a huge amount of rumors circulating regarding any Galaxy S mobile, and it seems as if Samsung is somewhat willing to play ball with such suggestions. However, in the ensuing climate following the the disaster of the Galaxy Note 7, it is hardly surprising that the Korean manufacturer wishes to proceed with caution. Thus, we haven’t heard too much from Samsung on the subject of the Galaxy S8, and the corporation has even chosen to duck its annual appearance at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. Samsung is assiduously ensuring that the Galaxy S8 is the absolute best smartphone that it can possibly produce, and this should lead to a very slick and stable device at the very least. There haven’t been any mind-blowing specs linked with the Galaxy S8, but the introduction of the Bixby AI assistant will be a major step forward for the series. We can, though, expect the processor, RAM and battery included in in the S8 to be improved. The bezels in the unit will also be slimmed down significantly to produce a new slimline design, and reports have suggested that Samsung will include a powerful front-facing selfie camera. As the first major smartphone released in 2017, those looking for an upgrade will be particularly attracted to the Galaxy S8. Image Source: ReleaseDatePortal Galaxy Note 8 The Galaxy Note 8 must pull out all of the stops to attract consumers in 2017 after the debacle of the Galaxy Note 7. And thus Samsung is expected to take more chances with this particular release. In particular, the Galaxy Note 8 could witness the first foray of the Korean corporation into 4K resolution. A whopping 6.2-inch screen has also been linked with this phablet release. Samsung may also choose to include a true octa-core processor this time round, while a massive 6GB of RAM is another rumored spec. Powerful camera technology and micro SD will bump the storage of the device up to 256GB, ensuring that this is an extremely powerful unit. Ultimately, the Galaxy Note 8 is likely to be one of the most advanced mobiles ever released when it arrives on the scene. hurk / Pixabay iPhone 8 Apple is expected to make significant changes to the iPhone design when the iPhone 8 is released in order to mark the tenth anniversary of the iPhone range. Thus, the iPhone 8 will feature a largely glass-based design, with the smartphone also notable for delivering the first ever curved screen in iPhone history. The iPhone 8 has also been linked with an edge-to-edge display, while Apple could also shift from LCD to OLED technology. There will be a certain onus on Apple to increase the screen resolution of the iPhone 8 in order to catch up with rivals. Thus, we could see a full HD iPhone smartphone for the first time when the iPhone 8 is released. Apple has also been strongly linked with augmented reality for the iPhone 8, with the Californian corporation having invested heavily in this innovative technology. Wireless charging and USB-3 have also been linked with the phone, and it seems that Apple is ready to remove the Home button from the device completely, instead replacing it with virtual buttons embedded within the display. Apple is also reportedly working on some nifty camera technology, while specs such as processing speed, storage and RAM will also get a boost. This promises to be the revolutionary iPhone release that fans of the hugely successful range have been promised for at least a couple of years. Image Source: iphonedigital/flickr.com iPhone 8 Plus Finally, the iPhone 8 Plus will accompany the mainstream iPhone 8, being released alongside the flagship smartphone. It is not entirely clear whether or not Apple will release two or three devices in the iPhone 8 generation, as the consumer electronics giant has also been linked with the release of a so-called iPhone X. But an iPhone 8 Plus release is a certainty, with the phablet backing up the iPhone 8 smartphone. But what differences can we expect between the two? Generally, the specs of the iPhone Plus range are superior to the smartphone, so a larger battery and more RAM can be anticipated. Apple will also fit the iPhone 8 Plus with a bigger screen, with some suggesting that there will be a 5.8-inch version of the iPhone this time round. Furthermore, Apple often includes superior camera technology in its phablet range, and this is likely to be replicated once more when the iPhone 8 generation hits the stores. Some obsesrvers have suggested that Apple will include dual-camera technology in all of its handset releases this time round, so it remains to be seen how the iPhone 8 Plus is distinguished from its smaller cousin. Those wanting the best Apple handset, with the largest, highest resolution display, will definitely opt for the iPhone 8 Plus. And there is even a chance that this could be the only mobile Apple releases this year that benefits from OLED technology.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Mail Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple The Better One Between Apple iPhone 8 vs. Google Pixel 2 Corazon Victorino International Business TimesMarch 5, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share After Google confirmed that a Pixel successor is hitting the market this year, the device is now expected to be one of the major competitors of Apple’s upcoming 10th anniversary iPhone, which is speculated to debut with the “iPhone 8” moniker. The iPhone 7 was not so much of an upgrade compared to its predecessor, so Apple is poised to change that with the next iPhone. On the other hand, Google’s Pixel 2 could raise the bar for Android smartphones coming out this 2017. Given that both handsets are likely to emerge successful upon their respective launch, it’s just fitting for us to look into them and see if one can one-up the other based on their rumored specs and features. Performance Apple’s iPhone 7 impressed a lot of people when it launched with the Apple A10 Fusion chip, which is basically a quad-core ARM processor composed of two high-performance Hurricane cores and two high-efficiency Zephyr cores. The six-core PowerVR Series7XT Plus GPU was also no joke for it enabled the device to do “console-level” performance when running mobile games. This year, the Cupertino giant is rumored to bring its A11 processor to the next-generation iPhone. Back in December, The Motley Fool reported that Apple’s supplier, TSMC, is going to manufacture the smartphone CPU using 10-nanometer technology. It is then expected to be more powerful and faster than the A10 Fusion. As for its GPU, analysts have said that the next-generation iPhone could come equipped with Imagination Technologies’ Series8XT, which is reportedly more power-efficient than the one on the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Geekbench scores for the current iPhones are really impressive, so we’re hoping to see higher ratings for the iPhone 8’s performance.  Google also ensured that its flagship smartphone, the Pixel, would be a powerhouse. The Android 7.1 Nougat-running handset debuted with the Quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 chipset, which is made up of two 2.15 GHz Kryo cores and two 1.6 GHz Kryo cores. The device also came wth the Adreno 530 GPU. The CPU and GPU combo in the Pixel was regarded as pretty stellar by the tech industry at the time. Looking at it now, however, the combination wouldn’t really be as impressive as before. Despite receiving great scores from Geekbench, it’s clear that the Pixel was nowhere near the iPhone 7 in terms of performance. BGR’s comparison of the handsets’ Geekbench scores showed that the Apple device crushed the Google phone in both the single-core (3488 vs. 1565) and multi-core (5590 x 4103) tests. The Pixel 2 is rumored to run on Snapdragon 835 CPU — the same chipset that will be powering Samsung’s Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+. If this were the case, then it’s certain that the iPhone 8 will trump the Pixel 2 in terms of performance. The Geekbench results for the Galaxy S8+ have already been leaked, and the Snapdragon 835 chipset received a lower score than the iPhone 7 Plus in the single-core test (1929 vs. 3473). In the multi-core test, the processor did better than the A10 Fusion, but the difference isn’t as significantly large as in the single-core test (6084 vs. 5664).  Display For the most part, the iPhone 8 is claimed to launch with a 5.8-inch display. What would make this screen special is the company’s rumored venture into edge-to-edge display that would see the death of the physical home button. This will not come as a surprise if true because the big players in the smartphone industry are migrating to this type of display for their flagship devices. LG already showed off its edge-to-edge design on the G6 at the recently concluded MWC 2017. Samsung is also said to have embraced this type of display design for its Galaxy S8. KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said back in February (via MacRumors) that the iPhone 8's display is an OLED panel. In spite of the larger screen estate, fans can expect the handset itself to retain the size of the current iPhone. Kuo said the measurements of the phone’s form factor would be the same as those of the iPhone 7, but the rather large screen will eat up the entire front panel of the iPhone 8. This would be possible thanks to the advanced technology that would allow Apple to embed its Touch ID fingerprint scanner onto the display itself. Read More There were rumors of Apple killing off Touch ID for a more advanced 3D scanner with facial recognition technology, but come to think of it, it’s unlikely for the Cupertino giant to just get rid of Touch ID after all of the hard work it has put into making it the first line of defense of iPhone users from hackers as well as the verification tool to authorize users’ purchases and other mobile monetary transactions. Nothing about the screen resolution has been mentioned so far, but we’re hoping Apple is considering bumping up the 750 x 1334 resolution and 331 ppi pixel density on the iPhone 7 for this year’s iPhone.  The original Google Pixel launched with a 5-inch AMOLED capacitive screen with 1080 x 1920 screen resolution and 441 ppi pixel density. Based on speculations from tech insiders, Google is sticking with the 5-inch screen size for the Pixel 2. It is also expected to have a 2560 x 1440 screen resolution. This improved screen resolution will make the handset the perfect partner of Google’s VR headset Daydream. While many believe that Google could be bringing the design of the first-generation Pixel to the upcoming version, there are also others who are hoping for the company to follow the new trend of edge-to-edge displays. If done well, this could help increase the reception of consumers since not everyone was a fan of the rather large top and bottom bezels of the original Pixel smartphone. Pocket-lint says shrinking the bezels is one way for Google to stay competitive now that most of the big players in the phone-making scene are starting to embrace the almost bezel-less design for their devices. There also wouldn’t be a problem if the Mountain View giant shifts to edge-to-edge display since the fingerprint scanner on the original Pixel is rear-mounted. By keeping the sensor at the back, Google will have less challenges to take on in making the almost all-screen front possible.  Camera Technology At launch, the biggest selling point of the iPhone 7 was its advanced camera technology. Its bigger brother stole the show for the most part with its dual-lens camera module that was marketed as a technology that captures DLSR-quality photos. The iPhone 7 also has a similar kind of camera; the only difference is it has a single lens instead of two. It has the same 12-megapixel sensor, phase detection autofocus, optical image stabilization and the quad-LED (dual tone) flash. For its front camera, the iPhone 7 sports a 7-megapixel FaceTime HD camera that’s capable of taking 1080p@30fps videos. It also has face detection, HDR and panoramic features. There’s no word yet on how Apple intends to top the rear camera of the iPhone 7, but there’s now word on a powerful front-facing selfie camera with 3D-sensing capabilities. This actually fueled speculations that Apple is getting rid of Touch ID because the front snapper is said to function as a 3D facial scanner as well as an iris scanner. JPMorgan analyst Rod Hall was even quoted by MacRumors in a separate report that facial recognition is a more secure alternative for Apple Pay.  On the contrary, Google set the bar high for Android-powered phones in terms of camera technology when it introduced its Google Pixel late last year. It even got a recognition from DxO Mark as the best smartphone camera yet. The back camera on the Pixel has a 12.3-megapixel sensor, an f/2.0 aperture, electronic image stabilization and laser autofocus as well as dual-LED (dual tone) flash. Despite not really having specifications that would make it stand out by leaps, Wired explains that the camera just impresses and blows everyone away because its HDR+ marquee mode takes images in rapid succession, analyzes them and creates some tone-mapping magic to create stunning photographs. The 8-megapixel front snapper is also commendable. This 2017, Google is likely to put a major emphasis on the camera of the Pixel 2. 9to5Google learned through sources that the company is developing a camera lens that will perform impressively even in low light conditions. The megapixels will not see a significant increase, but Google is going to compensate for this with extra camera features. Miscellaneous The iPhone 8 is going to have a water-resistant body. Compared to its predecessor, The Korea Herald reports the next-generation iPhone will have a higher water resistance rating. The iPhone 7 has IP67 rating by the way. With the 10th anniversary iPhone, Apple is aiming for an IP68 rating that would enable users to submerge their handsets underwater for 30 minutes without negative repercussions. There are also rumors Apple is re-adopting the glass body it used on the iPhone 4 instead of keeping its streak of using the aluminum body found on the recent iPhones. Apple supplier Catcher Technology says (via Nikkei) the glass body is returning this year. If true, Apple could make use of stainless steel frames to hold together the front and back glass panels of the device. For users who are very particular with the internal memory of their daily driver, the next iPhone could be the best iPhone for you yet. CNET reported late last month that Samsung’s biggest rival is ditching the 32GB base model for a generous 64GB starting memory variant. Previously, Apple got rid of the 16GB entry-level model when it launched the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. Other expected specs and features for the iPhone 8 include wireless charging, support for Apple Pencil, 3GB of RAM and a new color variant (Red). Given the premium hardware of the next-generation iPhone, it is said to come with a hefty price tag that could exceed $1,000.  Water resistance has become a must-have feature of flagship phones, so the Pixel 2 is also rumored to sport a water-resistant body. Trusted Reviews claims Google could be looking to build a handset with either an IP67 or IP68 rating just to compete with the iPhone 8 and the Galaxy S8. The Pixel 2 is also expected to come with a tougher build because the original Pixel’s metal body is prone to scratches and dents. Some are hoping for Google to improve the audio experience in the next-generation Pixel since the first-generation device have tiny and downward facing speakers. Perhaps Google could equip the handset with more powerful speakers to make it a notable media-centric device. Rumor also has it that the Mountain View-headquartered company is going to increase the base model’s internal memory. The first Pixel debuted with 32GB and 128GB storage variants. Since video files and mobile games are becoming more ambitious, a larger internal memory would come in handy. Thus, sources are saying Google could be boosting the base model’s storage to 64GB. Other standout features that are expected for the Pixel 2 include Quick Charge 4.0 and Android 8 or another modified Android software like the Android 7.1 Nougat of the first Pixel. Meanwhile, it’s very likely for Google to keep the same price points of the predecessors for the new models.  Apple is likely to launch the iPhone 8 in September, while Google could hold an October/November launch event for the Pixel 2.

Apple is expected to launch three iPhone models this fall, and Business Insider is reporting that the release date for the much-anticipated smartphone could be later than its typical September launch date. There will be two successors to the current iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, but one model will be completely redesigned and could cost over $1,000. The $1,000 model will be the much anticipated “10th anniversary” iPhone that will feature better “OLED” screen, redesigned fingerprint sensor, and other yet to be revealed technologies.

Apple is apparently developing its own technology for the fingerprint sensor that will sit under the display, instead of relying on tech offered by others. If they can pull off a September launch with a short turnaround time for shipping iPhone 8, it will be a tremendous achievement. iPhone 8 to use USB-C?

Here are 3 easy ways to find and buy AirPods, even when Apple says there are none available Dave Smith Mar. 5, 2017, 10:00 AM 73,267 facebook linkedin twitter email print Reuters/Beck Diefenbach Apple's truly wireless earbuds, called AirPods, are one of the hottest new gadgets right now. Despite being available for a few months now — they were supposed to release in October, but got delayed to December — finding AirPods is still incredibly tough. Unless you're extremely lucky, you will not be able to walk into an Apple store and find AirPods. Even if you ask store employees, like I did, they'll point you towards Apple's website, which says AirPods won't be widely available for at least another month. As of March 3, Apple says AirPods won't ship until April 21. But here's what Apple doesn't broadcast: Apple stores actually do receive routine shipments of AirPods on a semi-regular basis, albeit in small quantities. And there is a way to ensure you can find, buy, and pick up a pair of AirPods as soon as they become available at a nearby Apple store, which is way faster than waiting for Apple to ship them to your door. After trying this method myself, I was able to find and buy a pair of AirPods in less than a day. Here's how it works: View As: One Page Slides First of all, here's why these websites work in the first place: The following websites are not sanctioned by Apple in any way, but they are extremely accurate and work like a charm. Here's why: Apple stores won't advertise when they receive a new shipment of AirPods, but Apple's website does in fact update in real-time, and will reflect when any given store receives AirPods. There's no way to get notifications from Apple.com when new units are available, but these sites keep track of Apple's available inventory to give you alerts in various ways — some via email, some via browser notifications. Regardless of which website or service you choose, you'll also need to use Apple's own website to actually reserve your AirPods for pickup. Here's how that works: Apple; Dave Smith/Business Insider Once you get an alert from any of the following sites, quickly go to the AirPods page on Apple.com, click "Buy," but then choose the "Pickup" option on the page, as seen in the image above. You'll then see a list of nearby stores, based on the ZIP code you chose.   Apple Most of the stores will say AirPods won't be available for another month, but once you get an alert from any of these sites, you should see a green button instead of the ship dates, which will allow you to buy the AirPods online and pick them up from an Apple store that same day — in as little as one hour. The first site is by far the best: Fruit Basket. Guy Bianco/Fruit Basket Fruit Basket was created by Guy Bianco, a programmer based in North Carolina. To me, it's the easiest site to use because it's mostly hands-off, but still effective at alerting you. While the other options can send you emails, Fruit Basket can alert you as long as you keep the tab open on your browser; the site crawls Apple.com every 30 seconds, so there's less of a chance of you missing an opportunity. So long as you keep the Fruit Basket tab open on your desktop, you can have it alert you via browser notification as soon as there's AirPods stock available — it'll put a notification in the center of your screen, even if you're on another tab — as well as play a sound. It's extremely effective, especially if you're at work and on a computer most of the day. This was the site that worked for me: As soon as I got the notification that AirPods were available at Grand Central Terminal, I visited Apple's site, found the pick-up option for that store, purchased the AirPods, and picked them up in person — all in less than 30 minutes. Another great option: IsInStock.com IsInStock IsInStock can send you text or email notifications as soon as AirPods are available — this site also works for other Apple products and other rare items like the Nintendo Switch and PlayStation VR. To create an alert, you'll need to sign up to receive email and/or text notifications. Signing up also lets you choose which nearby stores you want alerts for, and you can also see a global map of what's in stock around the world in case you're interested. It's a useful site, but you have to be actively monitoring your phone and/or email for it to be truly effective — I got several emails saying AirPods were available at nearby stores, but since I didn't notice my emails immediately, waiting even just 10 minutes was enough for those units to sell out. Keep this in mind if you use IsInStock. Finally, the third best way to get AirPods: iStockNow. iStockNow iStockNow is very similar to IsInStock, in that it can show you a map of global availability for any given product, including non-Apple products like the NES Classic, and alert you via email when stock becomes available. That said, I found this site most useful by looking at stock in a list format. This provides a way of confirming what the other sites might tell you — are AirPods in stock in this store, or not? — and they'll also show you when those stores sell out to give you an idea of how long available stock actually lasts once it becomes available. The best piece of advice: Keep at it! Like I mentioned earlier, AirPods are sent to Apple stores on a semi-regular basis. This might mean your local Apple store gets in shipments every day or two, or every few days, or once a week, or once every couple of weeks. But if you sign up for alerts from any or all of these sites, you should be able to snag a pair of AirPods much sooner than Apple advertises. Best of luck, and happy hunting!

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Apple Struggled in the Education Market in 2016 as Schools on Tight Budgets Chose Chromebooks | Main | A $12 Million Dollar Civil Rights Lawsuit has been filed against Apple for Alleged Racial Profiling by Apple Store Staff » March 05, 2017 Apple Still in the Hunt for a Transformative Acquisition to set Apple TV on Fire Prior to the Arrival of the Mobile TV Revolution   In 2011 Steve Jobs biographer Walter Isaacson once recounted Jobs wanting to reinvent televison: "I'd like to create an integrated television set that is completely easy to use. It would be seamlessly synced with all of your devices and with iCloud.' No longer would users have to fiddle with complex remotes for DVD players and cable channels. 'It will have the simplest user interface you could imagine. I finally cracked it." Yet Apple fans around the world are still waiting for the TV revolution to arrive.   In 2013 when Apple's CEO Tim Cook was interviewed by NBC, the topic of TV came up and Cook's face lit up, as noted in our cover graphic, and he said "It's an area of intense interest."   In 2014 Cook focused on TV in an interview with Charlie Rose. Apple's CEO is always saying that Apple doesn't talk about future products, yet in 2013 and 2014 Cook went out of his way to make it sound like something huge on the television front was on the verge of debuting. It's 2017 and Apple is still in search of something that could excite Apple fans regarding Apple TV.   This week the Post had learned that "Senior Apple executives have reached out to some of Hollywood's most successful TV and film producers in the last couple of weeks about going to work for the tech giant.   While at least one of the discussions between Apple and an executive was vague when it came to the tech company's ultimate goal, the executive was left with the impression that the Cupertino, Calif., company is looking for a transformative acquisition and not just a deal to buy TV shows."   Every year, Apple is on the verge of something big with Hollywood and nothing comes to fruition. In early 2016 Patently Apple posted a report titled "Apple's Eddy Cue is on a Mission to Win Original TV Shows for Future Apple TV Service Bundle." In July another report was posted titled "Apple Once thought they cracked the TV Market, but just Keep Spinning their Wheels in Vain."   Last April Fast Company wrote a report According to five different sources who have been briefed on Apple's plans or spoken directly to Apple executives, the company is still a bit "disorganized," and these Hollywood principals complain that Apple hasn't presented a coherent strategy.   Evidently Apple thought they had something at one point in time but it could never materialize. Whether the Steve Jobs road map was too vague or the new leadership just couldn't find the magic lost with Jobs passing is unknown. But in that same time frame, Amazon came out of nowhere and created some amazing award winning TV series and their movie Manchester by the Sea walked away with two academy awards. They made Apple TV look irrelevant and outdated overnight.   In addition Google and Facebook are now in game or about to enter the market. Google is going to tie in their service to the Google Home device and I suspect that Amazon will introduce that on their Echo devices this fall.     While Apple is reportedly working on original TV series tied into Apple Music, it's unclear how well Apple's new service will be received beyond Apple's hardcore fans. The market is going to be so saturated with new TV services that Apple will have to do something rather dramatic for their new hybrid service to stand out. Tying it into a high end Apple HDTV could be what fans may want but are unlikely to get.   Hopefully Apple could pull off a win this year because after buying into the Apple TV box for years, many fans including myself will likely give up and go with another service. Apple TV's greatness has always been "just around the corner" and has never really materialized.   In many ways the key to the next TV revolution will be coming in 2018-2019 when 5G networks arrive and make mobile TV the next big thing. On that front, Apple owns the best smartphones and tablets on the market. So Apple could still pull off a big win in this market if they get their fan base recharged for this coming market later this year with a reinvented vision about content, content and more quality original content.   Apple has to go far beyond talk and finally deliver something tangible that can excite Apple fans because mere documentaries like Vital Signs or Carpool Karaoke, as fun as that is, isn't going to be enough to knock it out of the park.   Along with the arrival of Apple's exciting new high-end iPhones later this fall, Apple fans will be looking forward to seeing Apple deliver their all-new Apple Music/TV hybrid service that will prepare them for the coming 2018 5G mobile content revolution.    Until that day arrives, what would you like to see Apple's upcoming Apple TV service offer in terms of content over their competitors?

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile  ⋮  Software iOS 10.2 Has an ‘Ethernet’ Entry in the Settings App for iPhone & iPad By Uzair Ghani Mar 2, 2017 17Shares Share Tweet Submit Apart from the usual WiFi and Cellular options, you’ll be surprised to learn Apple baked in a new Ethernet entry in the Settings app. If Your Are Going to Hardwire Your iPhone or iPad to Ethernet, You Can Tinker with its Settings too Apple tends to bake new features into iOS depending on the use-case at hand. Now it has come to light if you connect an Ethernet adapter to your iPhone or iPad using a Lightning to USB 3 Camera adapter, then you will see a brand new entry pop up in the Settings app labelled ‘Ethernet.’ Using this new option, you can tinker around and see more information regarding the network you are hardwired too. This includes the IP address, subnet mask, router address, DNS, search domains, client ID, and of course, the usual settings pertaining to manual DHCP, static IP and more. Interestingly, the option is not visible at all if you aren’t connected to a network using a cable. Also, it should be noted here that Apple does not sell any sort of Lightning-to-Ethernet adapter to get things up and running immediately. Instead, you have to mix and match a few things if you want to jump into business. Still, with the new option in place, we have high hopes Apple will eventually release a dedicated adapter, allowing hardwired connectivity for iOS users. Advertisement Last but not the least, users should be aware of the fact that iOS has long accommodated Ethernet connections but there was no UI to manage things at all. Thankfully, with this addition in iOS 10.2, things are looking great for those especially in Enterprise. And of course, those who don’t tend to rely on WiFi at all for whatever reason. It remains to be seen if Apple will eventually come through with a dedicated adapter for iPhone and iPad users in order to access a network without having to use WiFi. But given how the company is setting up the entire stage, we have high hopes for a dedicated piece of hardware. What do you think about this little addition to iOS? Will you utilize it given you have the right adapters and dongles for it?

 What experts are saying about Apple's next big thing Kif Leswing Mar. 5, 2017, 8:00 AM 22,724 facebook linkedin twitter email print Not a real photo of Apple CEO Tim Cook.AP / Matthew Sumner for Getty Images There's a lot of pressure on Apple's next iPhone to deliver, both in product quality and sales.  Chatter from Apple's factories in Asia point to a completely redesigned iPhone coming out this fall, possibly with a better screen, longer battery life, and a $1,000 price tag. But perhaps the most interesting feature currently rumored for the so-called "iPhone 8" is a new "3D" camera.  The 3D camera would be the first step towards a technology called "augmented reality," which integrates the internet with the real world. It's a technology Apple CEO Tim Cook is fond of talking about in public.  In fact, earlier this year, he said it could "be as big as the smartphone," a technology that accounts for two-thirds of Apple's sales. Apple has bought several augmented reality startups, including FlyBy Media and Metaio, and has integrated some of them into a special projects camera group, Business Insider previously reported.  The ultimate goal is for augmented reality to inject computer graphics and important information into everyday situations — imagine raising your phone on the street and seeing directions to your next appointment, or a Pokemon hiding behind a bush. A 3D camera would allow the device to see how far away things are from it, which is critical for placing computer graphics in the real world in a way that they integrate seamlessly.  Eventually, a pair of smart glasses might replace your phone altogether to seamlessly integrate graphics and the real world. Apple never publicly comments on future products. But over the past few weeks, several Wall Street analysts have shared what they think they know about Apple's new "3D camera," and what it could mean for Apple investors and future Apple products — especially the high-end iPhone expected to launch this fall and likely to include the rumored 3D camera.  Steven Milunovich, UBS  UBS' Apple analyst wrote that "investors could be surprised at how AR could reinvigorate the iPhone/iPad and possibly result in new products" in a February 28 note in which he writes that Apple has 1000 engineers working on "a project in Israel that could be related to AR." He writes that Apple has an advantage over companies like Magic Leap, Google, and Microsoft for AR for four reasons: "hardware expertise and superior hardware/software integration; consistent updated releases with most customers on the latest version of iOS compared with the fragmented Android OS base;  an installed base of iPhone and iPad customers that can use AR rather than starting from scratch; and  a cloud infrastructure that facilitates data gathering." Milunovich also writes that "Apple's experience designing its own chips could present an opportunity." Here's how he sees Apple's potential AR timeline: UBS   In the short term, Milunovich believes Apple may integrate facial recognition and early developer tools for "basic AR experiences" into the next version of the iPhone or iPad, and that the features could improve retention rates and upgrade rates.  Andrew Gardiner and team, Barclays Barclays Gardiner's research note, dated February 22, focuses more on the specific hardware that Apple could introduce with upcoming versions of the iPhone or iPad, citing "research into the supply chain." "Comments from a number of optical and light sensing component companies over the last quarter or two have reignited discussion of the additional functionality to come in smartphones, in particular the so-called iPhone 8/X/Pro flagship device," Gardiner wrote. Gardiner spends a lot of time identifying which companies make the parts that go into the iPhone and which ones could stand to gain from a next-generation "3D camera."  He believes chipmakers like AMS, STMicroelectronics, Lumentum, and II-VI may be big winners as Apple includes a 3D sensor in 10s of millions of iPhones. A source familiar with Lumentum's business previously told Business Insider that the company would be supplying parts for the upcoming iPhone.  Ultimately, the big question for Gardiner is whether Apple will use a time-of-flight sensor or structured light sensor. He thinks Apple will use a combination of the two. Above is the chart he uses to explain the difference between the two. Both approaches have advantages and disadvantages, Gardiner writes. Apple currently includes a "time-of-flight" sensor in current iPhones.  Morgan Stanley  Primesense/Morgan Stanley Morgan Stanley's research looks more broadly at 3D sensing technology, and not necessarily Apple's interest in it. They write that 3D sensing will initially be limited to high-end smartphones, of which Apple makes up 70%-75% of the market.  The report looks at how 3D sensing works and which parts are generally needed: a light source, controlling optics, an image sensor, and a firmware chip.  They include a diagram courtesy of Primesense, an Israeli company that Apple bought in 2013.  Morgan Stanley cites AMS, a current Apple supplier, for potential applications for this technology, including "augmented reality and virtual reality, gesture, face recognition biometrics, improved 2D and video images, body measurement as well as autonomous driving." But Morgan Stanley questions the consumer appeal of AR and the viability of the requisite 3D camera technology, including whether most smartphones will have the necessary horsepower to do get the job done. Many people in the AR industry have told me that the power consumption and heat generated by processors are critical roadblocks. And it's not a given that the initial games and other AR experiences will click with consumers. Pokemon Go, an early AR app that had huge engagement, saw a sharp drop in usage after the initial novelty wore off.   Ming-Chi Kuo, KGI Securities KGI Securities In two notes issued in February, Kuo, widely seen as the top expert on Apple's supply chain, laid out everything he's hearing about Apple's 3D sensor, which he says is the result of "1-2 years spent on related-component R&D." He believes that the 3D camera on the upcoming phone will actually take the place of the front sensor, and will be composed of three modules. The application for this 3D camera is a "innovative user experience." "3D modeling offers a wide array of potential applications, for example replacing the head of a character in a 3D game with a user’s selfie (which contains 3D data), or using a 3D selfie (with depth information, unlike an existing 2D image) for AR/ MR applications," Kuo wrote.  In a previous note dated November 1, 2016, Kuo explained how he believes this fits in with Apple's product plans (emphasis ours): AR is related to all Apple’s current businesses; the key is that AR is an innovative human-machine interface that could be used in various devices & applications. All of Apple’s past successes were related to human-machine interfaces, such as mouse for Mac, click wheel for iPod, and multi-touch for iPhone and iPad. Assuming Apple successfully develops AR, we predict the firm will enjoy the following competitive advantages: (1) redefining existing key products and leading competitors by three to five years. For instance, this could happen for iPhone, iPad and Mac; (2) eliminating obstacles of Apple Watch and Apple TV by offering an innovative user experience; and (3) entering new business fields, such as autonomous driving system. We expect Apple to generate preliminary results for AR in the next 1-2 years at the earliest and working with iPhone may be the first step. Above is a diagram from a February 20 note explaining what sources he thinks will supply parts for the iPhone camera — largely lining up with the Barclays research.  Tim Cook, Apple CEO  But the biggest hints about Apple's augmented reality ambitions may come from its CEO himself. Here are the takeaways from his comments: He thinks that it could be a huge market opportunity: "I regard it as a big idea like the smartphone. The smartphone is for everyone. We don't have to think the iPhone is about a certain demographic, or country or vertical market; it's for everyone." Independent, February 2017  But it may take a while to come to fruition: "AR is going to take a while, because there are some really hard technology challenges there." Public speech, October 2016 First, Apple will integrate it into its existing platforms: "It will be enabled in the operating systems first, because it’s a precursor for that to happen for there to be mass adoption of it." Public speech, October 2016 Almost like a processor, not necessarily a standalone product: "It's a core technology, not a product per se." But when it does happen, he says it will be "profound": "Augmented reality will take some time to get right, but I do think that it’s profound. We might … have a more productive conversation, if both of us have an AR experience standing here, right?" Buzzfeed, October 2016 EXCLUSIVE FREE REPORT: 25 Big Tech Predictions by BI Intelligence.

Even the buttons on the elevators at Apple Park are said to resemble it. The button's tactile circularity promises an escape route to familiarity should users get lost or apps go wrong. However, its delicate components converge upon a recess in the phone's bezel, an area that could otherwise provide extra space to fit a larger display within the same handset profile. Rumors that the "iPhone 8" will replace the home button as we know it with an entirely virtual one can be traced back to April 2016. More recently, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo claimed that Apple will introduce a functionally distinct area below the screen exclusively for displaying virtual buttons, with a rumor over the weekend seeming to suggest that such a "function bar" is the reason behind conflicting reports over the display size of an upcoming OLED iPhone. Before the "function bar" rumor first surfaced, MacRumors forum member deuxani shared concept images, reproduced below, that offer some context for imagining how the bar might work. Framed within a 4.7-inch handset with minimal bezels, the virtual home button sits below the dock on the home screen in a separate dynamic space. Assuming Kuo's claims that the 5.8-inch OLED display includes a function bar, the remaining 5.15-inch primary display area allows existing apps to run fullscreen in their existing 16:9 aspect ratio. In the above example, only the home button is shown in the function area, but Apple could theoretically move the dock down with it, or add options for additional virtual icons like Bluetooth, App Switcher, Camera, or Siri. The shot on the right shows how the adoption of OLED screen technology might also enable the home button and indeed other screen elements to remain visible when the rest of the display is turned off. As with the Touch Bar on the 2016 MacBook Pro, native apps could be augmented with contextually adaptive virtual buttons, while third-party developers could code for additional UI elements alongside the home button, or bring frequently accessed functions into closer proximity with the user's thumb, as these concept designs for Instagram and Twitter envision. Other possibilities for virtual buttons could potentially include: Moving the back button from the top-left of the status bar to the bottom-left of the screen, alongside the home button; a scrollable strip to access additional buttons; media playback and video scrubbing controls; in-app navigation buttons; or perhaps additional space for game controls. "Soft" buttons on a smartphone are nothing new, but a "function area" on an iPhone could offer more flexibility by taking cues from the MacBook Pro's OLED Touch Bar. Patents show Apple has explored extending Touch Bar functionality to other devices, while Jony Ive has said the interface is "just the beginning of a very interesting direction" for the company. However, adapting the technology for an iPhone display likely presents distinct challenges, such as how to integrate the various functions the home button has inherited over the years (Siri, Reachability, exit Lock Screen, and so on), and how to avoid the presence of "dead space" where the Touch ID sensor would usually be located. iPhone 8 concept by Thadeu Brandão Indeed, ultimately the fate of a home button and "function bar" on an OLED iPhone may rest on Apple's ability to integrate fingerprint recognition technology into the display itself. A report earlier this week suggests Apple has solved this problem, but questions still remain. Will the display have a recess for Touch ID? Will new fingerprint recognition technology function across a larger screen area? And what other bio-recognition features might Apple include that could help solve the authentication issue? Facial recognition, iris scanning, and ultrasound methods have all been proposed. Rumors conflict over whether Apple will ramp up production earlier than usual for this year's OLED iPhone, but we may see part leaks that shed light on the design fairly soon. Other rumored features for the "10th anniversary edition" device include an edge-to-edge display, a glass body, some form of wireless charging, and extended battery life. The "iPhone 8" is expected to launch this September, alongside two more traditional "S" cycle iPhones with LCD displays.

I think there is potential here. One of my favorite things about iPhone 7 is the non-mechanical home button. I've let friends use my phone as guinea pigs and not one of them have noticed that it was not a button until I tell them. And no, they aren't idiots. Rating: 12 Votes odedia 2 days ago at 04:39 am So it's basically a touch bar for the iPhone. Makes sense given how apple likes to use the same concepts across their products. Rating: 4 Votes Avieshek 2 days ago at 04:28 am Wish 17" MacBook Pro could be offered in a 15" form factor similarly. I don't understand, a MacBook is rather a display without a touchscreen making it easier than an iPhone 8 with integrated fingerprint scanner as well to have zero bezels. Rating: 4 Votes subjonas 2 days ago at 07:16 am One of the main reasons I moved away from Android to iPhone many years ago was that I was fed up with always accidentally hitting the soft buttons on the bezel, and always having to look down at the bezel to press home. Jumping onto the iPhone with its one physical home button was like... coming home. Simple design at its absolute best. Apple, please don't sacrifice something classic and great for something new and kinda cool. Rating: 4 Votes NexusUser 2 days ago at 06:24 am You could've just said it will be like Android's on screen navigation setup... Seems fitting that Apple would copy one of the most iconic differences between iOS and Android for their 10th anniversary phone. I look forward to my iPhone friends demonstrating their "brand new" back button! Rating: 3 Votes SupaDav03 2 days ago at 09:26 am Wouldn't the option of leaving the Touch ID area visible even when the screen is off cause a crazy amount of burn in?

The store marks Apple’s second in Cologne and has been under construction for over a year now. The store is located in the high-traffic shopping district of Schildergasse. Mujjo Wallet iPhone 7 Case According to local blog Apfelpage, Apple has started assembling the teams for its new retail store in Cologne. The company has reportedly pulled some employees from the city’s other store at the Rhein Center. The new store has been under construction for nearly two years now and its opening is highly anticipated. We shared photos of the construction process a few months ago, showing the store start to take shape. Original photos of Apple’s signature wooden tables from the store can be dated back all the way to April of 2015, though. The Schildergasse shopping street is referred to as the busiest shopping street in Europe, attracting 13,000 people per hour. The street is 500 meters long and dates back to Roman times. The opening of an Apple store in this area is notable for a variety of reasons and this store will likely turn into one of Apple’s most popular locations around the world.   If Apple holds true to its normal tradition, the Schildergasse Apple Store will likely open during the morning of March 25th in celebratory style. We’ll have to wait for the company to release more specific details, though. Chance Miller @ChanceHMiller Chance covers Apple for 9to5Mac and contributes to 9to5Google, Electrek, and 9to5Toys.

By Marcia Sekhose | Updated: March 5, 2017 1:05 PM IST Email @marciasekhose comments Tags: Apple Apple iPhone 6 General The Apple iPhone 6 which brought in a new design for the iPhone series and a new Rose Gold color as well is somehow being revived discreetly. Apple has discontinued selling the iPhone 6 from its line of products. Adding an even more interesting element here to the equation is that the iPhone 6 here comes with 32GB storage. The iPhone 6 has so far been available in storage options of 16GB, 64GB and 128GB. An iPhone 6 with 32GB storage in space gray variant is currently available on Amazon in India. This comes shortly after Apple silently launched an iPhone 6 32GB variant in China. The iPhone 6 is displayed on the homepage of Amazon and is being given as an offer which lasts up to March 7. The smartphone is listed with a price of Rs 28,999 which is supposedly a discount from its original price of Rs 30,700. The iPhone 6 is being sold by a third party retailer named E-Mobiles and it comes with 1 year warranty. There is an EMI option available as well starting at Rs 2,590 per month. The specifications remain the same as the other iPhone 6 models, but the question remains as to whether this is indeed a genuine product or not. And Amazon has taken up the deal as a promotional offer and included on its homepage. It also comes right after Apple launched a 32GB variant of the iPhone 6 in China, but in gold color. The said 32GB iPhone 6 in China has been available in China as a low-end model sold by third-party retailers. The same 32B iPhone 6 model will reportedly go on sale in Taiwan by Taiwan Mobile starting March 10. Taiwan Mobile will offer the 32GB iPhone 6 in gold variant for around $45 per month with a 30 month contract, reports 9to5Mac. Apple iPhone 6 specifications Apple launched the iPhone 6 back in 2014 in three different storage variants. Recalling the iPhone 6, it features a 4.7-inch LED-backlit IPS LCD display. In addition to the storage options, the iPhone 6 comes with 1GB of RAM. Under its hood, runs an Apple A8 dual-core Cyclone processor clocked at 1.4GHz. On the software front, the iPhone 6 runs on iOS 8. ALSO READ: Apple iPhone 6 review roundup: Is this the best iPhone ever? In the photography department, the iPhone 6 sports an 8-megapixel rear camera with autofocus, and dual-LED flash. Up front, the smartphone houses a 1.2-megapixel selfie camera. The iPhone 6 is powered by a 1,810mAh battery. The connectivity options available on the iPhone 6 include 4G LTE support, Bluetooth v4.0, Wi-Fi and GPS.

However, online reports have been mostly based on rumors and unverified leaks. Different Mac rumors have also been circulating about the specs of one of 2017’s most anticipated new devices. News about the Cupertino-based tech giant’s newest premium tablet come out almost every week. However, none of them have come even remotely close to confirming its design and features. Nonetheless, we have rounded up the most recent and widely-circulated claims about the next-generation iOS gadget. Key features Alleged insiders have claimed that among the iPad Pro 2’s key specs include a 2224 x 1668p display. However, reports also stated that the tablet will still have the same pixel density as its predecessor. HIS market analyst Rhoda Alexander added that it will even sport the same 9.7-inch dimension. In spite of these unupdated features, Forbes claimed that the device will have a larger screen aspect ratio. This will be made possible by bezels that will be significantly reduced in terms of its . There are also rumors about its smoother navigation and A9X chipset. Aside from the 9.7-inch tablet, Apple will allegedly come out with other similar variants for more upscale techies. These allegedly include a higher-end 12.9-inch iPad Pro. There will also supposedly be an additional 10.5-inch variant that will be priced slightly higher than the generic one. There are also iPad Pro 2 rumors about its accompanying accessory, the Apple Pencil 2. The digital stylus pen will reportedly get an array of improvements this year. As per Mobipicker, it is very possible that the supplementary device will be released alongside the tablet. iPad Pro 2 release date DigiTimes said that the tablet will be released sometime this May or June 2017. This is contrary to previously reported earlier dates. The delay has allegedly already affected iPad component suppliers such as TPK and Foxconn. Both supposedly got very low first quarter financial results for this year and are pressuring Apple to speed up the launch. Other Mac rumors Aside from the iPad Pro 2, other Mac rumors have been keeping enthusiasts on their toes since 2017 began. For one, a  lot of patrons have been eager to learn more about the tablet line’s lightweight variant. The iPad Air 2 was released towards the end of 2014, so many believe that it badly needs a much newer version. However, the possibility of Apple releasing four different tablets this year just seems unlikely for some. The fact that none of the four have even been confirmed by the company also makes things very vague. Because of this, the public has been advised to just wait for Apple’s official announcements.

By Hadlee Simons on 3 March, 2017 A new report has refuted claims that Apple will be ditching the Lightning connector in favour of a USB Type-C port. Earlier this week, the Wall Street Journal, citing “people familiar with the matter”, reported that the Apple would use the Android and Macbook standard on its smartphone. “They said Apple would introduce other updates including a USB-C port for the power cord and other peripheral devices instead of the company’s original Lightning connector,” the publication was quoted as saying. At the time, we wondered whether this could mean an actual Type-C port on a new iPhone or on the power cable going into the adapter. Now,  noted analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has claimed that Apple will use “Type-C Power Delivery” but will keep the Lightning port, Apple Insider reported. In other words, Apple could integrate the underlying USB Type-C power technology into its own Lightning connector. A respected analyst has disputed claims that Apple will ditch the Lightning port in favour of USB Type-C The analyst explained that one advantage of a USB Type-C port was the ability to transfer HD videos at a faster rate, but he said that this was a “niche” application for the tech. Kuo added that Apple was expected to retain the Lightning port across three iPhones this year. Will the three iPhones be comprised of the iPhone 7s, iPhone 7s Plus and an SE model? Well… rumours claim that, in addition to an iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus, Apple is readying a high-end iPhone that packs a curved OLED screen. Expect the rumour mill to be working overtime in the next few months, as Apple and its suppliers get ready to ramp up production of the new handsets.

Here’s a list of the five best options ranging in price from around $100 to over $2500. When Apple introduced the iPad back in 2010, it wasn’t the first tablet to hit the market because plenty of Windows Tablet PCs existed. Today, Apple’s tablet stands out from the crowd in terms of sales and mind share. In fact, the term iPad is synonymous for many people with the word tablet regardless of the brand. Not everyone wants an iPad, though, and they’re looking for good alternatives like the five here. Some users want a Windows computer that runs their programs instead of apps. Vertical markets often rely on proprietary software without an iOS or even Android version available. Only a Windows tablet will do. That’s why we’ve rounded up a list of the 5 best iPad alternatives that run Microsoft Windows. These Windows tablets come in various sizes and speeds, but they all run a full version of Windows and can potentially run all or most of your Windows software. We avoided the 2-in-1 convertibles with the keyboard permanently attached except for one favorite. The rest will function without a keyboard attached and some come with specially designed keyboards like the Surface Pro 4 and Samsung’s Galaxy TabPro S. Microsoft Surface Pro 4 – Best of the iPad Alternatives Probably the best Windows tablet available comes from Microsoft. Every model of the Surface Pro 4 includes the great all metal hardware design with a fantastic 12.3-inch display boasting a 2736 x 1824 resolution. The display has excellent multi-touch capability and works with the amazing Microsoft Surface Pen. It might be the best stylus available on a tablet, except for maybe the iPad’s Apple Pencil. The Surface Pro 4 has a full-sized USB 3.0 port, a micro-SD card slot, headset/mic combo jack, and a DisplayPort. The bottom edge also connects to the Surface Type Cover, which comes extra for $129.99 without a fingerprint reader and $159.99 with one. They also now sell a Signature Edition Type Cover with special fabric material, but no fingerprint reader. It’s also $159.99. Enjoy up to 9 hours of battery life, depending on your screen brightness, the programs you running and the processor you have. Speaking of processors, Microsoft configures the tablet with the following combinations and prices: Intel Core m3 processor, 128GB SSD and 4GB of RAM for $699 (sale price, regularly $799). Intel Core i5 Processor, 128GB SSD and 4GB of RAM for $999. Intel Core i5 Processor, 256GB SSD and 4GB of RAM for $1,099 (normally $1,199). Intel Core i7 Processor, 256GB SSD and 8GB of RAM for $1,499. Users can also configure other combinations. We maxed out the specs with 16GB of RAM, Intel Core i7 Processor and 1TB SSD and it costs $2,599. For more coverage on the Surface Pro 4 see the following posts from our team: Microsoft Surface Pro 4 Review 11 Exciting Things You Can Do With a Surface Pro 4 How to Set Up a New Microsoft Surface Pro 4 Samsung Galaxy TabPro S – Gives Surface Competition The Samsung Galaxy TabPro S might seem like a “me-too” device from Samsung copying the hardware of the Surface Pro 4, but that’s a good thing. It copies it in the best areas and even adds some improvements. First, here’s a list of the specs that make this an impressive alternative to the iPad Pro for $799 and $749 at B&H Photo: 2.2GHz  Intel Core M Dual-Core processor 4GB of RAM 128GB SSD 12-inch 2160 x 1440 AMOLED display 1 Type C USB port 1 headphone/mic combo jack 802.11ac and Bluetooth 4.1 Built-in GPS and NFC Up to 10 hours battery life Some specs that stand out in comparison to the Surface Pro 4 include the AMOLED display and a Type-C USB port. Samsung’s AMOLED displays look amazing with bright and rich colors. Type-C future proofs the tablet a little since that’s the direction computing is going. Samsung also added GPS and NFC to the list. That makes it more useful on the road and for quick connections via NFC. It also includes the keyboard at that price which is something Microsoft doesn’t do. The Samsung C Pen that gives the tablet pressure sensitive writing and drawing features like the Surface Pen costs extra ($79.99 retail, but it’s usually available for under $60 at Amazon or B&H Photo). Dell Latitude 11 7000 Series – Best of Midrange iPad Alternatives The Dell Latitude 11 5000 Series tablet starts at about $750. It competes with the Surface Pro 4 since it comes with an optional keyboard that attaches to a port along the bottom edge. The 10.8-inch screen features a 1920 x 1080 display that supports multi-touch and the Dell mini-pen for writing and drawing on the screen. An optional keyboard connects to a special port on the bottom edge giving users a laptop-style experience with their tablet. Starting at $749, buyers can get an Intel Core M3 processor, 4GB of RAM and 128GB SSD. Other optional configurations can include an M5 processor, up to 8GB of memory and a 256GB drive. Maxed out it costs $1,068. The list of ports and buttons includes: 1 USB Type C 3.1 port for data and charging Full-size USB 3.0 port Micro-HDMI Headphone/mic combo port Fingerprint reader Micro-SD card reader Noble lock slot for security Volume up/down rocker Windows button Lenovo IdeaPad Miix 310 – Best of the Low-cost iPad Alternatives This ten-inch system comes in at $300 making it the cheapest tablet in the round-up.  In fact Amazon sells it for even less at $233. It runs on an Intel Atom X5 Z8350 processor, which means it’s also the lowest powered device in our list. The 2GB of RAM and 64GB SSD means this machine is best for browsing the web, running simple programs and reading. You can also stream audio and video. The 10.1-inch display sports a lower resolution of 1280 x 800. You can run that display for up to 10 hours. Add Bluetooth 4.0 and 802.11 b/g/n for connectivity. There’s a keyboard dock to connect the detachable keyboard included with the tablet. Other ports include a micro-HDMI, micro-SD card reader, headphone/mic combo jack, micro-USB 2.0 and 2 full-size USB 2.0 ports on the keyboard. The tablet alone weighs only 1.28 lbs and less than 2.5 with the keyboard attached. That makes it one of the lightest available. NuVision TM800W610L Signature Edition Tablet – Bargain Basement The NuVision Signature Edition Tablet makes our list for two reasons. It’s super cheap at only $150 from Microsoft Store or $100 at Amazon and it’s one of the only 8-inch Windows tablets available today. Buyers can look hard for some models that are no longer manufactured. Dell’s Venue 8 and the Toshiba Encore 2 8-inch model still show up on Amazon and other places, but Dell and Toshiba don’t make them anymore. NuVision designed the Signature Edition Tablet with a basic black plastic case, a 1920 x 1200 resolution, an Intel Atom processor and a meager 2GB of RAM and 32GB of storage. It comes with an expansion slot that supports up to 128GB in the form of a micro-SD card. The battery lasts up to 6 hours, a little low these days. But that’s probably enough for most people who will use this as a Windows book reader plus social networking, Internet and email. It can handle things like Netflix or streaming audio, too. The tablet has a single micro-USB port, a micro-HDMI port and mic/audio combo port. Add Bluetooth 4.o and 802.11n Miracast enabled Wi-Fi. Miracast lets users cast the screen to supported devices like the Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter or a Roku Box or Stick. Which Windows Tablet to Buy? So which of these five tablets should you buy? If you just want the best tablet available without concern for price, go with the Surface Pro 4 and get as much as you can afford. It’s a great device and works well as a laptop with occasionally using it as a tablet. The Samsung Galaxy TabPro S gives the Surface Pro a run for the money, so find one at a Best Buy store or Microsoft Store to see if you like the AMOLED screen better. Also, the USB Type-C port might make it a better option for some, since that’s the future of connectivity. People who want the smallest and cheapest should look at the NuVision. It’s under-powered for most tasks, but not for the very basic tasks of reading books, playing streaming video or music, and doing your day-to-day email tasks. You can even hook it up to an external display to use it for presentations or hook up a keyboard and get some work done. Buy the Lenovo if you want a larger 10-inch screen, but also want a lower price and have basic needs. The 1280 x 800 resolution seems a bit low, but the long battery life that comes as a result will make road warriors with limited needs happy. The included detachable keyboard makes it a great deal. The Dell’s a good mid-range option for people who can’t afford the Surface or Samsung, but want more than the Lenovo or NuVision tablets offer.

In iOS 10.2, Apple has added configurable Ethernet-specific UI to the Settings app. When connecting a compatible Ethernet adapter via something like Apple’s Lightning to USB 3 Camera adapter, an Ethernet preference panel will automatically appear below the Wi-Fi section in the Settings app. The best wireless keyboard for the Mac? As noted by developer Steve Troughton-Smith, the Ethernet preferences are a welcome addition to the Settings app for anyone who regularly uses a hardwired Ethernet connection with their iOS devices. I tested the connectivity on my iPhone 7 Plus running iOS 10.3 beta 4, and it worked just as expected. After connecting my USB Ethernet adapter to my iPhone using the Lightning to USB 3 Camera adapter, the Ethernet preferences automatically appeared shortly thereafter. iOS 10.2+ finally has a UI for USB ethernet adapter settings 🎉 pic.twitter.com/r7mojxgdGE — Steve T-S (@stroughtonsmith) February 28, 2017 Video walkthrough Subscribe to 9to5Mac on YouTube for more videos As you can see from the screenshots below, the configurable Ethernet pane is wedged between the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth preferences panes. Tapping on Ethernet allows you to select the Ethernet interface, and tapping the interface displays connectivity details related to the interface. The Interfaces section seems to suggest that you can even have multiple Ethernet adapters connected to the same iOS device. If you’re running iOS 10.2 or above, you too can see this Ethernet pane after connecting a compatible USB Ethernet adapter. It’s a relatively simple addition, but one that will prove to be quite useful for iOS users who prefer Ethernet connectivity. To get your iOS device online with Ethernet, you should be able to use one of the many Ethernet adapters available, but you may need to combine it with a powered hub to provide it with adequate power. Keep in mind that you’ll also need some way to connect the USB cable to your iOS device, which is where something like the aforementioned Lightning to USB 3 Camera adapter comes into play. One of the benefits of using Apple’s powered dongle is that you may not need to combine the Ethernet adapter with a powered hub. Have you ever used an Ethernet adapter with your iPhone or iPad? Would you ever consider doing so? Jeff Benjamin @JeffBenjam Jeff leads 9to5Mac’s YouTube channel — editing and producing tech videos, walkthroughs, how-tos, written tutorials and reviews.

The original verdict reached by a Texas jury stuck Apple with $533 million in damages. Sony A6500 Smartflash LLC targeted game developers who largely all settled out of court in 2014, but Apple defended its use of data storage management and payment processing technology in court. Reuters has more on the new developments: The trial judge vacated the large damages award a few months after a Texas federal jury imposed it in February 2015, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit said on Wednesday the judge should have ruled Smartflash’s patents invalid and set aside the verdict entirely. A unanimous three-judge appeals panel said Smartflash’s patents were too “abstract” and did not go far enough in describing an actual invention to warrant protection. Apple originally lost its case in February 2015 when a Texas jury slammed Apple with $533 million in damages out of the $852 million demanded from Smartflash LLC. Today’s development likely marks the end of this episode.

Friday’s complaint concerns three apartment buildings – located at 201 5th Ave. N., 621 5th Ave. S., and 401 Pine Street in Edmonds – that are managed by defendant Debbie A. Appleby, of Stanwood, Wash. The properties are owned by three Limited Liability Corporations controlled by Appleby – Apple One, LLC, Apple Two, LLC, and Apple Three, LLC—which are also named as defendants in the suit. The complaint alleges that in March 2014, defendant Appleby told a woman seeking an apartment for herself, her husband and their 1-year-old child that the apartment buildings were “adult only” and therefore not available to her family. The complaint also alleges that at various other times from April 2014 to November 2015, defendants advertised their available apartments as being restricted to adults only. The family filed a complaint with the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which conducted an investigation, issued a charge of discrimination against the defendants, and referred the case to the Department of Justice. “Equal access to housing is essential for all Americans, including families with young children,” said U.S. Attorney Annette L. Hayes. “Particularly in our tight housing market, landlords must follow the law and make units available without discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, disability or familial status.” “The Fair Housing Act prohibits landlords from denying apartments to families just because they have children,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Tom Wheeler of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division. “Many families already face challenges finding affordable housing, and they should not also have to deal with unlawful discrimination.” The complaint seeks a court order requiring defendants to cease their discriminatory housing practices, damages for the family that filed the HUD complaint and any other families against whom the defendants discriminated against because they had children, plus civil penalties. Any individuals who have information relevant to this case are encouraged to contact the Civil Rights Division at 1-800-896-7743, Option 96.The case is being jointly handled by trial attorney Kathryn Legomsky for the Civil Rights Division for the U.S. Department of Justice and Assistant United States Attorney J. Michael Diaz for the Western District of Washington. You can read the full Justice Department complaint here.

We couldn’t figure it out because she was one of the first people to view and she and her husband had great jobs. Now she knows. Reply Laura Johnson March 4, 2017 at 2:14 pm Joy- That is disappointing, but Edmonds is not immune and discrimination eventually touches all of us. We need to take a stand against discrimination and profiling- in their many unjust forms. Reply Alec denson March 4, 2017 at 9:30 pm “not immune to discrimination” – pretty euphemistic way of putting it. Edmonds is one of the whitest places in western Washington.

Home Contact Advertise About RSS @PowerPage @JasonOGrady Rumor: All three 2017 iPhone models to feature Lightning port with USB-C fast charging Posted by: Chris Barylick Date: Friday, March 3rd, 2017, 05:06 Category: Hardware, iPhone, Lightning, Rumor, USB-C It’s thought that all three upcoming iPhones will both retain the Lightning connectors but add USB-C Power Delivery for faster charging. The rumors currently state that Apple will release an all-new OLED model with a larger L-shaped battery and updated 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch models, according to KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. Kuo offered the following comment in his most recent note: New 2H17 models may all support fast charging. We believe all three new iPhones launching in 2H17 will support fast charging by the adoption of Type-C Power Delivery technology (while still retaining the Lightning port). A key technical challenge lies with ensuring product safety and stable data transmission during a fast charge. In order to achieve that goal, we think Apple will adopt TI’s power management and Cypress’s Power Delivery chip solutions for the new iPhone models. We note the OLED version may have a faster charging speed thanks to a 2-cell L shaped battery pack design. Kuo has stated that he expects Apple to retain the Lightning port, which features a similar design compared to a USB-C port. Such a move retains the requirements for the MFi Program licensing income from Lightning accessories. Kuo also added that he believes USB-C’s high-speed data transmission is “still a niche application” for iPhone. The 12.9-inch iPad Pro already supports USB 3.0 speeds and fast charging with a Lightning to USB-C cable, while iPhones and other devices with a Lightning connector still transfer at USB 2.0 speeds. The prediction comes only two days after the Wall Street Journal reported that at least one upcoming iPhone model would feature a USB-C port instead of a Lightning connector. Apple’s latest MacBook Pro models are equipped with Thunderbolt 3 ports, which share the same connector design as USB-C, while the 12-inch MacBook also has a USB-C port. Apple could still bundle a Lightning to USB-C cable with its next iPhones to allow for connectivity with those notebooks out of the box. Stay tuned for additional details as they become available.

Home Contact Advertise About RSS @PowerPage @JasonOGrady Apple adds second-generation Apple TV to “vintage” and “obsolete” lists, halts support for the device in most areas of the world Posted by: Chris Barylick Date: Friday, March 3rd, 2017, 05:33 Category: Apple TV, Hardware, News As much as you may love your second-generation Apple TV, it’s now on Apple’s “vintage” and “obsolete”products list, thereby rendering it ineligible for repairs in most parts of the world. With the new change, the only places where service and parts may still be available are in Turkey and California, where the device is still classified as “vintage” according to an Apple support document. Vintage devices are defined as being made over 5 but less than 7 years ago, and the category typically excludes products from support except where required by law. For all other places, the second-generation Apple TV has been declared “obsolete”, which generally refers to products discontinued more than seven years ago. The second-generation Apple TV launched in September of 2010 with production ending in 2012, when it was replaced by the third-generation unit. Apple is already largely distancing itself from the third-gen model, providing minimal updates. A fourth-gen model with support for apps and Siri went on sale in Oct. 2015. An upcoming fifth-gen device is expected to add 4K resolution support and likely a faster processor to match, but not much else. As always, stay tuned for additional details as they become available.

Launched in 2008, Spotify had 40 million paid subscribers in September and the company tweeted the 50 million figure on Thursday, the same day messaging app company Snap Inc pulled off its massive share sale that bodes well for other technology companies considering a flotation. Apple, which launched its music service less than two years ago, had about 20 million subscribers in December and its entry looks to have done little to slow the rapid growth of its older Swedish-based rival. Spotify, which has yet to show a profit as it spends to grow internationally, is now looking at a possible stock market listing in the United States, online news portal TechCrunch said last month. A company spokeswoman declined to comment on Friday on when it might seek a listing. But a partner at a leading investor in Spotify, venture capital firm Northzone, said late last year the company could start to become profitable as early as 2017 after years of focusing squarely on "growth, growth, growth". Spotify is the most highly valued venture backed start-up in Europe and according to media reports is considering a listing on Nasdaq and potentially a dual listing on the Nasdaq exchange in Stockholm, where the company is headquartered. It was last valued at $8.53 billion, according to venture capital market research firm CB Insights. That valuation alone would make a flotation Europe's biggest technology start-up listing since the market launch of German e-commerce investor Rocket Internet in 2014. While still loss-making, Spotify has posted rapid subscriber growth since it was created a decade ago by Swedish founders Daniel Ek and Martin Lorentzon. Following its announcement on Thursday that it had reached 50 million paid subscribers, Ek made a point of retweeting a comment from Wall Street media analyst Rick Greenfield which pointed to how Spotify was adding subscribers at an increasingly rapid rate. The Stockholm-based company also announced a major expansion in New York last month. One of Europe's most highly valued venture-backed start-ups, Spotify will move its New York office to the World Trade Center from the Midtown area of Manhattan, adding more than 1,000 new jobs. In 2016 Americans used on-demand streaming platforms, such as Spotify, to listen to 431 billion music tracks, Nielsen said in its U.S. year-end report.

What’s Up with iOS 10 Performance Josh Smith09/22/2016 Why is my iPhone slow after installing iOS 10? Is it a conspiracy by Apple to convince users to buy the new iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus? Soon after the iOS 10 update arrived we started to see users wondering if slow iOS 10 performance is something Apple does to convince users to upgrade to a new iPhone. Apple is now offering iOS 10.0.2 to users as an over the air update. It includes bug fixes and the stability of your iPhone and iPad as well as specific fixes for Lightning headphones, crashes in Photos and with app extensions. We hear this every year with a major iOS update, and perhaps more so this year with Apple’s decision to offer the iOS 10 update on aging devices like the iPhone 5 and and iPhone 5c. Some users are already saying they will wait for iOS 10.1 to arrive before updating since later updates typically fix speed issues on some devices. iOS 10 better not slow down my iPhone — мoнɑммɑd™ (@Mohammad_07) September 13, 2016 Join us for a look at the complaints about a slow iPhone and how you can try to fix slow iOS 10 performance without buying a new iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus. What you need to know about slow iPhone performance on iOS 10. Slow iPhone issues appear frequently after updates, partially due to the phone needing to re-index items, but also due to other upgrade challenges and out of date apps. Installing iOS 10, hope it doesn't slow down my iPhone 5s because lots of people said it could 😞 — sad (@humbIebunny) September 13, 2016 We are also hearing about complaints from iPhone 5c, iPhone 5s and iPhone 6 owners who feel that iOS 10 slowed down their iPhone and trends show an increase in search for “iPhone is slow” near each major release of new Apple software. iPhone Slow: Is it a Conspiracy? When you start using a new version of iOS on your older iPhone it may suddenly seem much slower. In fast, it may be slower in some areas due to the challenge of running new software on an older device. Is Apple intentionally slowing down your old iPhone to make you upgrade to a new iPhone? There is no proof that the company is doing this, and it seems unlikely considering that users can simply choose not to install iOS 10. https://twitter.com/abbie_hartley2/status/775759451613720576 Another important thing to consider is that Apple doesn’t need to use slow performance to get users to upgrade, when they purposely keep features limited to the new iPhone. Some times we see new features that should in theory work on older iPhones only show up on the newest model. Conspiracy alert, but I'm sure whatever model of iPhone I have starts to slow down whenever a new version is imminent. Convinced of it. — Johny (@johnycassidy) August 11, 2015   Instead of relying on crippling older phones, Apple adds in new iPhone 7 specific features to iOS 10 and adds new features to the phone like water resistance, a new home button and upgraded cameras. iOS 10 Performance In our time testing the iOS 10 update on the iPhone 6s we didn’t run into slowdowns that some users complain about. We are in the process of testing iOS 10 on other Apple devices to see how it handles. Sure, there are iOS 10 problems, but slow performance isn’t one of the major complaints just yet. Watch the iOS 10 vs iOS 9.3.5 speed test video below showing the iPhone 6 to see any speed differences. On an older device like the iPhone 5c or iPhone 5, there is often a greater chance of experiencing slow iPhone problems. Below you can see iOS 10 vs iOS 9.3.5 on the iPhone 5. It’s a good idea to check out the performance of your iPhone on iOS 10 before you update.   How to fix Slow iPhone iOS 10 Performance How to fix slow iOS 10 performance. Learn how to fix slow iPhone performance on iOS 10. This will work on your iPhone 5 or your iPhone 6, it doesn’t matter which iPhone you have, these three options allow you to improve slow iPhone performance after installing iOS 10. Reset Settings The easy solution to slow iPhone performance is to reset all settings on your iPhone. This will not delete your apps, data or music, but you will likely need to re-setup WiFi connections and you will need to customize your iPhone settings again. To start, go to Settings -> General -> Reset -> Reset All Settings -> Enter Your Passcode. Now, wait for the iPhone to restart. Reset Your iPhone The next level solution to completely reset your iPhone. If you are using an older iPhone and you have not ever started over from scratch since you bought it, this is a good time to try starting over. This will wipe all of your data from your iPhone and you will need to sync it back or to restore from a backup. Use these options to fix slow iPhone problems on iOS 10. If you restore from a backup you may bring some problems back, but it is the easiest way to get all of your data on to your iPhone again after a reset. Once you are done backing up, you can go to Settings -> General -> Reset -> Reset All Settings and Content -> Enter a Passcode. This will restart your iPhone and wipe it clean. This will take some time and you cannot use your iPhone while it happens. Go Back to iOS 9 You can still go back to iOS 9 for a limited time. This normally only lasts a week or more so if you are concerned, now is the time to go back to iOS 9. You can only go back to iOS 9.3.5, but you can go back and wait for iOS 10.0.1 or iOS 10.1.

Wasn’t the use of Metal supposed to provide a boost like Apple said? My 64 GB iPhone 6 Plus in some small areas is a little more polished in IOS 9 (for example clearing out notification seems smoother/more cleanly animated), and Safari scrolling and wifi is good, but in more noticeable areas there’s a tad more lag and drop in frame rates in numerous areas whereas the iPhone 6 hasn’t suffered as much. The iPhone 6 Plus still has some significant choppiness when you open up many of the stock apps, then touch in place to bring up the keyboard, then rotate the iPhone into landscape orientation and watch how choppy it can be. I’m hoping for more polish and optimization in 9.1. My iPad Air still stutters and lacks the spit and polish of iOS 6 when it comes to frame rates, and overall animations. 12/17/2015 J Marin Reply I’m with you. Additionally, I’m (still) dumbfounded in the general lack of chat / awareness of the unique & ongoing (seemingly endless) performance issues specific only to the iPhone 6-Plus! 03/04/2017 Karen Anne Kramer Reply IOS10 was automatically installed in my I6s. I was not asked if I wanted it. It is so slow that I wish I had my old flip back. Apple is messing up. 09/22/2015 Ian Reply I have a 4s & just down loaded ios9 & I have no 3G but everything else is fine 03/02/2016 kaitlynn Reply my wont install. 04/11/2016 Nicole Reply If your iOS 9 download or installation locks up, you’ll want to hold down the power button and the home button for 10 seconds. This typically jumpstarts the process. from: http://www.gottabemobile.com/2016/04/07/ios-9-problems-fixes/ 09/22/2015 Bgff Reply Somebody at Apple development needs to suffer a quick and untimely death 09/27/2015 Joe Reply I have the new iPhone 6s and my iOS 9 runs choppy at times. Think it’s just an update issue in general don’t know what’s going on 09/28/2015 Bond Reply yes my iphone 6s plus also runs choppy seems to be slower when rotate or swipe right and left. 09/29/2015 Serhii Aksiutin Reply This video is demonstrating the real performance of iOS 9. You can try to reproduce these steps on your own iPhone 6 Plus to make sure – https://youtu.be/qNfx6eMNfC8 By the way, I have downgraded my iPhone 6 Plus to iOS 8 while it is allowed by  10/09/2015 BybyeApple Reply Have an iphone 6 and updatet to ios 9.0.2. The Performance is annoying. iOS 8 felt much faster. Now there are noticable lags while scrolling or opening an app. Thanks apple for turning my just outdatet but expensive as hell iphone into an silly laggy thing. This crap is okay when the phone costs the half of this one. First and last iphone. Bye 10/22/2015 Brad Reply GREED… Plain and simple. Without providing proper warning of issues, true concrete fixes nor explanation after all this time simply demonstrates they EXPECT us to upgrade to newer products. Apple doesn’t give a flying f@$k about how much u spent on you’re older phone/iPad, they’re only concerned about how deep THEIR pockets are getting. 11/07/2015 Apple sks cck Reply After iOS 9 rolled out, I began using it as a doorstop, I bought an old Nokia 3210 and now my stress levels have disappeared. 10/24/2015 Alexander Reply Why do you need 10 pages of long-winded blah blah to explain 3 simple as ass settings? 10/28/2015 Sharon Reply After updating to 9.0.2 on my I6, my phone immediately drags- it’s so slow. Wish I would’ve never updated the new software!! 11/07/2015 matt Reply bye bye apple ios9.1 sucks and you knew it when you put it out. Laggs beyond the next county!!!! 11/19/2015 helya Reply Thank you!! Upgraded iphone 5 to ios 9.1. was a disaster, phone kept freezing. the reset all did the trick! 11/22/2015 haily clark Reply never buying an iphone or apple product again every update completely screws up my phone -ANGRY AND NOT SATISFIED CUSTOMER 11/24/2015 Ks1 Reply Upgraded iPhone 4S 16GB to IOS9 and phone performance hasn’t been compromised. First backed up iPhone, reset phone to factory, did upgrade to i9, restored iPhone after. No issues at all after upgrade. 01/02/2016 Christinerbruck Reply 2=7 my buddy’s step-mother makes $77 every hour on the internet . She has been unemployed for 10 months but last month her pay was $16929 just working on the internet for a few hours. go right here… See More 01/03/2016 tristen briggz Reply New software on a old device? common that’s the users fault for installing. users are offered an update they’re not forced to update. it’s all about making money…how’s this now being realized? it’s been happening ever since iOS 7 came out. I’ve never updated an iOS device over its A# processor, neither should you. 01/06/2016 Jun Villar Reply The apple company should give notice to the user/customer about their new updates specially for old phone that the updates maybe cause lag or choppy if you install this new updates for old phones. The end user always looking for good performance that’s why we are upgrading ios software for us to know that the new updates will give better performance, but the apple never told to their customer what happen to your old phone after upgrading for new ios software it’s more of money making regardless the satisfaction of the customer. That’s disappointing side for apple. 01/07/2016 Jason Reply 5 iphone6s plus 128gb phones I have returned in the last month due to Touch ID lag issues with IOS 9.1 & 9.2, so the phones have a bug in the software out of the box, Apple have denied they know of the problem. I have tryed everything from setting up new phone, to disabling things on the phone, nothing works, still lags. Apple just won’t admit that their flagship phone is faulty. Waiting on replacement phone now and if that doesn’t work bye bye Apple. 01/10/2016 Khizerkhan Reply I m using apple from its first generation till now (like iPhone 6) like i have all apple devices from ipod to macbook, if apple did that and want their customers to upgrade their cell phones to 6s then this is such a bullshit and its such a greedy step for apple , if this is true then i m gonna throw my apple to the trash , and gonna b a samsung user 01/25/2016 Daanish Reply I have an iPhone 6 running on ios 9.2.1, it is like when i open any application it takes more than 8 seconds to open i tried reset also. Having a slow iPhone is tooo annoying 04/14/2016 Soumya Reply Very nice article and informative too i have read one similar article about freeing up space in iPhone 6s here https://plus.google.com/100710735407062767969/posts/QiM5mfihDgs but i should say your article covers everything one needs to know while using iPhone. Although the article is a bit lengthy to read but at the same time it has some very interesting stuff. 04/30/2016 Bob Reply I have an iPhone 4s. It worked amazing for years, until an upgrade to IOS 9.0.2. Why is an upgrade offered if it’s not going to run correctly on the hardware. I have better things to do than read up on this crap. It just needs to work. No downgrade, how convenient. This is a complete scam. Android time. Bye Apple scammers. 05/24/2016 h Reply WTF? 05/29/2016 Wtfguy Reply Lol wtf 08/13/2016 Stewartlud Reply Can’t believe anyone is surprised by apples greed, they didn’t get big by being nice. I use apple produçts but I to hate apple or ” Crapple” as I call them. Morally speaking Crapple is totally corrupt but stupid trendy young people are the trend so expect more crap to be accepted by the mass of idiots. IOS is designed for 12 year old girls now thats why it looks like colored candy. Just look at the idiotic man bun to see how bad it has become. Steve jobs would have Tim and Ivey killed if he saw what they did to the company. 09/13/2016 Paul Reply IOS 10 has gone BACK instead of forward especially when it comes to being able to delete ALL e mails and TRASH them all. They have gone BACK to the old way of editing EACH e mail one by one. Ridiculous! 09/14/2016 Al Reply I just updated to iOS 10 on my iPhone 6. At first it was slow but after a day of use its somehow gotten better. The Touch ID for instance is actually better than it was on 9.3.5. My phone isn’t lightening fast but it no slouch either. Overall I’m satisfied though I must admit iOS 10 is a better experience on iPhone 6s, and 7 because 3 touch enhancements and raise to wake feature. 10/01/2016 Deepak Sogani Reply Apple is now on the lines of Nokia!!!! Steep slope down. Save my this message in less than an Year instead of I7 taking them up it will ruin them. Their Boss is no more and the kids play the juniors are making will ruin them. 10/04/2016 lhamo Reply Damn!! Really disappointed with ios10(iphone6). The new look is cool and all but the performance has really slowed down. I have noticed late notification and at times i dont get any notifications until when i turn it. This mostly happened with viber, i open and see many messages and missed calls(wth my phone didnt even ring, ugh), never had that problem with ios9. Hope they fix it soon. Resetting my phone had no effect what so ever. 10/08/2016 Shine Reply I have the iPhone 6 Plus and to say the performance/function of my phone has changed (after the iOS 10 upgrade) would be an understatement! I set a timer and it took exactly 31 seconds just to open your page alone in order to read this article. Tried playing one of your tutorial videos and I gave up after the minute mark. I don’t believe that Apple has some conspiracy to make you run out and buy the latest and greatest phone they have on the market but something has definitely gone haywire with my phone as of late. In fact I’ve never had any issues with previous updates before but the changes with the iOS 10 has been very noticeable… not to mention very frustrating. 😬 10/14/2016 Martin Reply Hi guys, today I finally found out what my problem was with slow wi-fi was. Waaaaaait for it… It was the bluetooth interfering with my wi-fi. 10/26/2016 Vili Ionut Blt Reply Who paid you to write this article? Cuz it sure was Apple. I am also among the victims and I had iOS 8.1 prior to upgrading to iOS 10.2 Now it moves like a bucket….. So stop being so duplicitary cuz i’m sure it also slows down iphone 6 too. 12/21/2016 Casey C Reply “Can simply choose not to install iOS 10” Yeah, stopped reading after this as the author lost all credibility. Have you actually tried not installing the update? The phone “reminds” you to update, at first every day, but eventually every 2 hours, and your only option to avoid updating is choosing “Remind me later” and enter your lock code every time. And then your phone reminds you again in two hours. Then one day my phone basically bricked itself, and my options were to restore and lose any recent messages, etc. that were not backed up, or update to iOS 10. Tell us again how we get to choose. 01/18/2017 Eric Reply I would have to disagree about the “conspiracy”. 1. For every major iOS update (8 to 9, 9 to 10), there is are always major issues. Namely phone slowing down. This has never failed for me. And the only way it was fixed, I upgraded to the lastest iPhone with the latest iOS pre-installed. Every time I do this, the phone runs like a dream. Until I upgrade to the latest iOS again. Then back to square one. 2. Apple can and has download it’s software on to my phone without my knowledge or consent. Namely, the latest iOS update. I’d go to sleep, and in the morning I get message saying latest update is ready for install. So if they can push software to your phone without you knowing or permitting, they can do anything to your phone without your knowledge. 3. Apple NEVER gives you a straight answer as to why this happens. C’mon, that’s pretty stupid for a bunch of smart people. They know. They just can’t say or won’t. Classic deniability. And most people will just give up and take it up the arse, and say “that’s life”. It works for every other business out there. If consumers can’t prove, they have nothing to worry about. And really, we paid for a $1200 phone, to run as it was advertised. And it makes no sense what so ever to have to shut off features, reset settings, reinstall everything to make this phone run close to what it’s supposed. What’s the point? Oh, and btw, none of those things ever worked for me. Only upgrading to the latest iPhone works. But again, until I have to update to the latest iOS. And you can’t say, “just don’t update”. Well, that would be great, but if I want to download an app that requires the latest iOS, or update an app which requires the latest iOS, I’m SOL. Damned if I do, damned if I don’t. Yes, yes, people can say, “well it doesn’t happen to me”. Well good for you. As you can see it happens to plenty of other people. You don’t have cancer, does that mean it doesn’t exist? Or that others don’t get it? Apple has changed quite a lot since the passing of Jobs. I’ve been using Apple products for the past 25+ years. Back then, the slogan “It Just Works”, was so right on the money. Had very, very few issues. And the issues that did arise, was easily fixed. By myself. But now, the slogan should be “It Just Might Work…cross fingers”. Mac OS feels more and more like Windows. Apple seems to like more steps to do things than the fewer from older OS’s. All the useful features were removed, in place of glitz and glam that only caters to social media users. Now the rest of us “power users” have to purchase third party software to get all the features they removed. Really though, how hard is it for Apple to just have an “ON” and “OFF” switch for features we don’t need or like? Why are we relegated to taking what they want to give us? I may just have to start looking into Android phones. And PC’s. These days, most PC’s are just as good, or almost as good as Macs. But cheaper. And like I said, Macs are starting to feel more and more like Windows anyway. Might as well save some money. Cook is no Jobs. Not even close. Bad choice. He’s tearing down the house that Jobs built. And building a crappier version. 01/26/2017 RyanF Reply Great article. However, I differ when the author mentions that if iOS updates were to purposely slow down iPhones, people would simply not proceed to download. Let’s remember that Apple sets a number of limitations to users who don’t download the most descent IOS updates (ex. Not allowing iPhone restore, just to name few).

The iPhone 7 was not so much of an upgrade compared to its predecessor, so Apple is poised to change that with the next iPhone. On the other hand, Google’s Pixel 2 could raise the bar for Android smartphones coming out this 2017. Given that both handsets are likely to emerge successful upon their respective launch, it’s just fitting for us to look into them and see if one can one-up the other based on their rumored specs and features. Performance Apple’s iPhone 7 impressed a lot of people when it launched with the Apple A10 Fusion chip, which is basically a quad-core ARM processor composed of two high-performance Hurricane cores and two high-efficiency Zephyr cores. The six-core PowerVR Series7XT Plus GPU was also no joke for it enabled the device to do “console-level” performance when running mobile games. This year, the Cupertino giant is rumored to bring its A11 processor to the next-generation iPhone. Back in December, The Motley Fool reported that Apple’s supplier, TSMC, is going to manufacture the smartphone CPU using 10-nanometer technology. It is then expected to be more powerful and faster than the A10 Fusion. As for its GPU, analysts have said that the next-generation iPhone could come equipped with Imagination Technologies’ Series8XT, which is reportedly more power-efficient than the one on the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Geekbench scores for the current iPhones are really impressive, so we’re hoping to see higher ratings for the iPhone 8’s performance.  Google also ensured that its flagship smartphone, the Pixel, would be a powerhouse. The Android 7.1 Nougat-running handset debuted with the Quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 chipset, which is made up of two 2.15 GHz Kryo cores and two 1.6 GHz Kryo cores. The device also came wth the Adreno 530 GPU. The CPU and GPU combo in the Pixel was regarded as pretty stellar by the tech industry at the time. Looking at it now, however, the combination wouldn’t really be as impressive as before. Despite receiving great scores from Geekbench, it’s clear that the Pixel was nowhere near the iPhone 7 in terms of performance. BGR’s comparison of the handsets’ Geekbench scores showed that the Apple device crushed the Google phone in both the single-core (3488 vs. 1565) and multi-core (5590 x 4103) tests. The Pixel 2 is rumored to run on Snapdragon 835 CPU — the same chipset that will be powering Samsung’s Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+. If this were the case, then it’s certain that the iPhone 8 will trump the Pixel 2 in terms of performance. The Geekbench results for the Galaxy S8+ have already been leaked, and the Snapdragon 835 chipset received a lower score than the iPhone 7 Plus in the single-core test (1929 vs. 3473). In the multi-core test, the processor did better than the A10 Fusion, but the difference isn’t as significantly large as in the single-core test (6084 vs. 5664).  Display For the most part, the iPhone 8 is claimed to launch with a 5.8-inch display. What would make this screen special is the company’s rumored venture into edge-to-edge display that would see the death of the physical home button. This will not come as a surprise if true because the big players in the smartphone industry are migrating to this type of display for their flagship devices. LG already showed off its edge-to-edge design on the G6 at the recently concluded MWC 2017. Samsung is also said to have embraced this type of display design for its Galaxy S8. KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said back in February (via MacRumors) that the iPhone 8's display is an OLED panel. In spite of the larger screen estate, fans can expect the handset itself to retain the size of the current iPhone. Kuo said the measurements of the phone’s form factor would be the same as those of the iPhone 7, but the rather large screen will eat up the entire front panel of the iPhone 8. This would be possible thanks to the advanced technology that would allow Apple to embed its Touch ID fingerprint scanner onto the display itself. There were rumors of Apple killing off Touch ID for a more advanced 3D scanner with facial recognition technology, but come to think of it, it’s unlikely for the Cupertino giant to just get rid of Touch ID after all of the hard work it has put into making it the first line of defense of iPhone users from hackers as well as the verification tool to authorize users’ purchases and other mobile monetary transactions. Nothing about the screen resolution has been mentioned so far, but we’re hoping Apple is considering bumping up the 750 x 1334 resolution and 331 ppi pixel density on the iPhone 7 for this year’s iPhone.  The original Google Pixel launched with a 5-inch AMOLED capacitive screen with 1080 x 1920 screen resolution and 441 ppi pixel density. Based on speculations from tech insiders, Google is sticking with the 5-inch screen size for the Pixel 2. It is also expected to have a 2560 x 1440 screen resolution. This improved screen resolution will make the handset the perfect partner of Google’s VR headset Daydream. While many believe that Google could be bringing the design of the first-generation Pixel to the upcoming version, there are also others who are hoping for the company to follow the new trend of edge-to-edge displays. If done well, this could help increase the reception of consumers since not everyone was a fan of the rather large top and bottom bezels of the original Pixel smartphone. Pocket-lint says shrinking the bezels is one way for Google to stay competitive now that most of the big players in the phone-making scene are starting to embrace the almost bezel-less design for their devices. There also wouldn’t be a problem if the Mountain View giant shifts to edge-to-edge display since the fingerprint scanner on the original Pixel is rear-mounted. By keeping the sensor at the back, Google will have less challenges to take on in making the almost all-screen front possible.  Camera Technology At launch, the biggest selling point of the iPhone 7 was its advanced camera technology. Its bigger brother stole the show for the most part with its dual-lens camera module that was marketed as a technology that captures DLSR-quality photos. The iPhone 7 also has a similar kind of camera; the only difference is it has a single lens instead of two. It has the same 12-megapixel sensor, phase detection autofocus, optical image stabilization and the quad-LED (dual tone) flash. For its front camera, the iPhone 7 sports a 7-megapixel FaceTime HD camera that’s capable of taking 1080p@30fps videos. It also has face detection, HDR and panoramic features. There’s no word yet on how Apple intends to top the rear camera of the iPhone 7, but there’s now word on a powerful front-facing selfie camera with 3D-sensing capabilities. This actually fueled speculations that Apple is getting rid of Touch ID because the front snapper is said to function as a 3D facial scanner as well as an iris scanner. JPMorgan analyst Rod Hall was even quoted by MacRumors in a separate report that facial recognition is a more secure alternative for Apple Pay.  On the contrary, Google set the bar high for Android-powered phones in terms of camera technology when it introduced its Google Pixel late last year. It even got a recognition from DxO Mark as the best smartphone camera yet. The back camera on the Pixel has a 12.3-megapixel sensor, an f/2.0 aperture, electronic image stabilization and laser autofocus as well as dual-LED (dual tone) flash. Despite not really having specifications that would make it stand out by leaps, Wired explains that the camera just impresses and blows everyone away because its HDR+ marquee mode takes images in rapid succession, analyzes them and creates some tone-mapping magic to create stunning photographs. The 8-megapixel front snapper is also commendable. This 2017, Google is likely to put a major emphasis on the camera of the Pixel 2. 9to5Google learned through sources that the company is developing a camera lens that will perform impressively even in low light conditions. The megapixels will not see a significant increase, but Google is going to compensate for this with extra camera features. Miscellaneous The iPhone 8 is going to have a water-resistant body. Compared to its predecessor, The Korea Herald reports the next-generation iPhone will have a higher water resistance rating. The iPhone 7 has IP67 rating by the way. With the 10th anniversary iPhone, Apple is aiming for an IP68 rating that would enable users to submerge their handsets underwater for 30 minutes without negative repercussions. There are also rumors Apple is re-adopting the glass body it used on the iPhone 4 instead of keeping its streak of using the aluminum body found on the recent iPhones. Apple supplier Catcher Technology says (via Nikkei) the glass body is returning this year. If true, Apple could make use of stainless steel frames to hold together the front and back glass panels of the device. For users who are very particular with the internal memory of their daily driver, the next iPhone could be the best iPhone for you yet. CNET reported late last month that Samsung’s biggest rival is ditching the 32GB base model for a generous 64GB starting memory variant. Previously, Apple got rid of the 16GB entry-level model when it launched the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. Other expected specs and features for the iPhone 8 include wireless charging, support for Apple Pencil, 3GB of RAM and a new color variant (Red). Given the premium hardware of the next-generation iPhone, it is said to come with a hefty price tag that could exceed $1,000.  Water resistance has become a must-have feature of flagship phones, so the Pixel 2 is also rumored to sport a water-resistant body. Trusted Reviews claims Google could be looking to build a handset with either an IP67 or IP68 rating just to compete with the iPhone 8 and the Galaxy S8. The Pixel 2 is also expected to come with a tougher build because the original Pixel’s metal body is prone to scratches and dents. Some are hoping for Google to improve the audio experience in the next-generation Pixel since the first-generation device have tiny and downward facing speakers. Perhaps Google could equip the handset with more powerful speakers to make it a notable media-centric device. Rumor also has it that the Mountain View-headquartered company is going to increase the base model’s internal memory. The first Pixel debuted with 32GB and 128GB storage variants. Since video files and mobile games are becoming more ambitious, a larger internal memory would come in handy. Thus, sources are saying Google could be boosting the base model’s storage to 64GB. Other standout features that are expected for the Pixel 2 include Quick Charge 4.0 and Android 8 or another modified Android software like the Android 7.1 Nougat of the first Pixel. Meanwhile, it’s very likely for Google to keep the same price points of the predecessors for the new models.  Apple is likely to launch the iPhone 8 in September, while Google could hold an October/November launch event for the Pixel 2.

The Raiders were down 46-12 to Apple Valley, which went on to wins its 12th straight team state title, heading into the final match. All that was left was for Guck to go out there and take on Apple Valley heavyweight Gable Steveson, a world champion who’s likely the best high school wrestler in the nation. What can you possibly say to a kid in that spot? “You just tell them that this is a great opportunity. How often do you get the opportunity to wrestle a world champ? Never, really,” McLay said. “I say, ‘Take advantage of the opportunity, have fun, and don’t get hurt.’ ” Have fun and don’t get hurt? “That’s seriously what I tell them,” McLay said with a smile. “The thing is those guys have all the pressure on them, and go out there and have fun and try to surprise yourself and take advantage of the opportunity, because you just don’t get a lot of those in life. That’s all you can ask. It’s just a good opportunity to wrestle against one of the best in the world, so why not?” Guck was pinned in 45 seconds, which is about the average result of a Steveson match. Apple Valley Eagles Gable Steveson controls Anoka Tornado Brandon Frankfurth during the 285 pound match of the AAA championship match at the Minnesota State High School Wrestling Tournament at Xcel Energy Center in St. Paul on Thursday, March 2, 2017. Stevenson pinned Frankfurth in 22 seconds as Apple Valley would win the team AAA title with a 30-24 victory over Anoka. (Special to the Pioneer Press: John Autey) Minnesota always seems to have at least few of those world-class, nearly unbeatable wrestlers at the state tournament. This year it’s guys like Steveson (38-0) and Kasson-Mantorville’s Brady Berge (44-0), both of whom cruised into Saturday night’s individual state finals in their respective weight classes. Then, of course, there was Mark Hall, who won his sixth individual state title as an Apple Valley senior at state last year. In the opposing coaching corner for Hall’s final high school match was again McLay, coaching then-Hastings senior Austin Eichmann. Hall beat Eichmann by technical fall, 16-1. But Eichmann got second place and is pictured on this year’s state tournament program cover for his efforts. Of course, the picture is of Hall lying on top of him. “So I take a picture of it and send it to (Eichmann) and I go, ‘You made the cover!’ ” McLay said. “Typically, you’d be bummed out if you’re getting crushed on the cover, but he’s like, ‘You know what, I’m not even mad!’ I’m like, ‘I know, it’s pretty cool.’ ” That seems to be the overwhelming opinion of wrestlers who go up against those unmovable forces. “It was pretty fun wrestling the best,” said St. Cloud Tech senior Micah Mangel, who was pinned by Steveson in the first period of a first-round matchup in the Class 3A, 285-pound division Thursday. Mahtomedi senior Evan Lawrence was excited when he saw the draw for this year’s Class 2A, 160-pound individual tournament, which pitted him against Berge in the first round. “I just kind of looked forward to it the whole week,” Lawrence said. His plan of attack against Berge, a Penn State commit, was to go “out there wanting to have fun and trying to score some points against a high-caliber guy like that.” EARLY CHAMP CROWNED The individual state finals were slated for 6:30 Saturday night, but one champion was determined before 3 p.m. Moorhead’s Sam Grove clinched the Class 3A, 195-pound title by winning his semifinal match over Centennial’s Justin Mohlin. Grove didn’t have to wrestle the final because his opponent, St. Cloud Tech’s Tyler Hugg, missed the match with a concussion. Hugg suffered the concussion in his semifinal match with Eastview’s Mike Delich. Delich, who was previously undefeated, took Hugg down in the first period. But the takedown was deemed illegal by the referees, and because the move caused Hugg to not be able to continue, Hugg won the match by injury default. Grove’s state title was Moorhead’s first since 2012.

The address of the brick-and-mortar store is Schildergasse 1-9, which sits on one of the busiest shopping streets in Europe. Doors open on March 25. The announcement confirms long-held rumors that Apple has been planning a second store in the city. Evidence surfaced in January that it was putting the finishing touches to a store at the sought-after retail location, which was previously occupied by European clothing brand Pohland. Local blog Apfelpage reports that Apple is already in the process of transferring some of its Rhein Center store staff to the new location. The street of Schildergasse has a Roman history and derives its name from schild, (meaning shield), because artists who lived there in the Middle Ages were known for their paintings of coats of arms. Every hour, some 13,000 people pass through the street, which spans 500 meters from Hohe Straße on the Eastern End to Neumarkt on the Western End.

Now these voters want jobs. CNN Money9:41 UP NEXT Once famous mobile phones such as Nokia's classic 3310 from the turn of the century have been given a new lease of life as Chinese manufacturers revive Western brands to get an edge in an increasingly cut-throat handset market. Apple and Samsung lead the smartphone pack worldwide but impressive growth in the Chinese market has left room for a host of home-grown manufacturers to come to the fore, with China's Huawei now third in the world. Quotes in the article Nokia Oyj NOK = 5.28 0.00 0.00% Apple Inc AAPL ▼ 139.34 -0.44 -0.31% Lenovo Group Ltd LNVGF ▲ 0.6072 +0.0036 +0.60% Sony Corp SNE ▼ 31.18 -0.38 -1.20% Within China, Oppo surged to become market leader last year and it is expanding rapidly in Asia to stand fourth in the world rankings, even if its brand is little known in developed and increasingly stagnant Western markets. A closely related Chinese brand, Vivo, has muscled its way into fifth place globally. What this means, though, is that former Chinese market leaders, such as Lenovo and TCL Communications are losing ground, and some are counting on retro Western brands to revive their fortunes at home and abroad. Emerging from a sea of indistinguishable smartphones, the showstopper at this year's main European technology trade fair was a revival of the Nokia 3310, its brightly colored cases and month-long battery life tugging at the heartstrings of erstwhile fans in search of a digital detox. Full screen 1/3 SLIDES © REUTERS/Paul Hanna/File Photo FILE PHOTO: Nokia 3310 device is displayed after its presentation ceremony at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona 2/3 SLIDES © REUTERS/Eddie Keogh/File Photo FILE PHOTO: The Nokia 3310 is seen in an office in London 3/3 SLIDES © REUTERS/Paul Hanna/File Photo FILE PHOTO: Nokia 3310 device is displayed after its presentation ceremony at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona 3/3 SLIDES The new phone was launched by Finnish firm HMD Global, led by former Nokia executives and backed financially by Chinese electronics giant Foxconn (2354.TW), which makes devices for Apple and Sony (6758.T), among others. Priced at 49 euros, the 3310 is meant to appeal to old fans in the West as well as finding a new generation of younger users in emerging markets looking for a good-looking reliable phone. The BlackBerry made a splash at the Barcelona trade fair too thanks to China's TCL Communication, which unveiled a BlackBerry-licensed handset with the physical keyboard many professionals clung onto even as Apple's iPhone revolutionized the smartphone market. BlackBerry Ltd supplies the phone's security software. TCL, which is part of a group that makes appliances ranging from TVs to washing machines, has kept France's Alcatel brand alive for a decade. TCL-Alcatel is now the world's 10th biggest smartphone maker, according to research firm Strategy Analytics. INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION Lenovo, the world's third largest mobile phone supplier in 2014 when it acquired U.S. cellphone pioneer Motorola, has subsequently sunk to ninth globally but is counting on Motorola as its premium smartphone brand to battle back. The Chinese firm is even open to following in Nokia's footsteps and reviving the retro, flip-top Motorola Razr, which was the second best selling phone in the world in 2004 and 2005. Lenovo Chief Executive Yang Yuanqing told CNBC this week that launching a revamped Razr could be a way of bringing customers back to the Motorola brand as it tries to drive into developed markets such as the United States. The Philips handset brand also lives on in India and China after the Dutch firm licensed its brand to Sang Fei, a subsidiary of TPV Technology, which also makes Philips television sets. For now, though, the top Chinese phone makers such as Huawei, Oppo and Vivo, look set on developing their own brands in a domestic market that is still growing even as demand in developed economies plateaus. China accounted for more than a third of the world's mobile phones shipped last year and domestic firms still had 90 percent of sales, according to a government report. But as the market becomes overrun with me-too smartphones and margins evaporate, rivals may spot more opportunities to leapfrog rivals by capitalizing on familiar Western brands, said Strategy Analytics analyst Neil Mawston. "As the Chinese market peaks and organic growth becomes harder, these brands may consider takeovers as the fastest way to speed up their expansion," he said, referring to moves overseas. "At some point, either Huawei, Vivo or Oppo may come to the point where buying an existing international brand is their best way to expand," Mawston said. Analyst say possible targets could include famous phone brands fallen on hard times including Japan's Sony or Taiwan's HTC. "It could well be that we see more brands of yesteryear picked up by Chinese brands," said phone industry analyst Ben Wood of CCS Insight.

Live Watch Home> Technology Best iPad Keyboards Reviewed: Logitech Ultrathin Keyboard, ClamCase, Apple, ZaggFolio By JOANNA STERN (@joannastern) July 18, 2012 ABCNEWS.com The iPad has surged in popularity because it's great for surfing the web, watching video, playing games, and navigating beautiful apps. No one will dispute that. But work? Real work, like typing emails, writing documents, creating presentations? That's a bit harder on a tablet. And no one will dispute that either. While the on-screen keyboard is fine for basic typing here and there, when it comes time to type a longer draft you will likely find yourself reaching for the laptop. The virtual keyboard can be difficult to type on for a long time. It takes up half the screen, and many can't type on it as fast as a real keyboard, with keys that click and clack. That's where an iPad keyboard accessory fits in. There are a bunch of options that pair with the tablet via Bluetooth. But which one will let you get the most real work done? Words Per Minute: 86 Apple Apple's Wireless Keyboard ($69.00) Let's start with the one that Apple makes -- the Apple Wireless Keyboard. The Bluetooth keyboard wasn't made only for the iPad -- it also works with Macs -- but it works like a charm with the tablet. Of all the keyboards I've tested here, I was able to type the fastest on it because of its wide footprint. The keys are spacious and the size of the ones on Apple's MacBook Pro laptops. I typed most of this review on the keyboard and got out an impressive 86 words per minute. It really was just like typing on a laptop. But while the keyboard was fine at my desk, it wasn't great when I left the desk. It doesn't latch on to the iPad in any way. You also have to have a separate stand for the iPad, though Apple's Smart Cover can do the trick. Still, while it is the best for typing on in one place and is only $69, there are much more mobile options out there. Words Per Minute: 73 Zagg Zagg Zaggfolio ($99.99) The ZaggFolio is an all-in-one keyboard and case for the iPad. Inside the plastic (or polyurethane) folding case is a Bluetooth keyboard which is very easy to pair with the iPad. (The basic on / off button might not seem like the best design, but the simplicity can't be beat.) The cover protects the back and front of the iPad, and the top folds up to help prop up the iPad. There is also a slot to hold the iPad in place above the keyboard itself. Speaking of the keyboard, it isn't as wide or large as Apple's but the keys are well spaced for their size and are firm and sturdy. I was able to type fairly fast on it at 73 words per minute, though the small Delete key did bother me. However, the iPad-specific shortcut keys make up for that. They include volume controls, search, and copy and paste, all along the top row. The case is a tad heavy, but at $99.99 it's a good value. Another plus? It comes in number of different colors, including black, red, pink and blue. Words Per Minutes: 76 Clamcase ClamCase If your mission is really to turn your iPad into a laptop or netbook, the ClamCase might be the best solution. You can put your iPad in it and close it up and it looks like a little laptop. But the design is versatile. You can also flip the screen around and turn it into a stand without the keyboard showing. However, there is a major sacrifice for all that: it is a clunky and heavy case. On the one hand, the iPad stands up vertically and very solidly, but on the other, you have a package that weighs 1.7 pounds -- and that's not including the iPad. I also didn't love the feel of the keyboard. And for $150, I was actually hoping it would feel better-made. The keys seemed flimsy and mushy. That said, I was still able to type quickly on it at 76 words per minute. It also has iPad shortcut keys along the top, which are very helpful. Words Per Minutes: 71 Logitech Logitech Ultrathin Keyboard Cover ($99.99) The Logitech Ultrathin Keyboard Cover might be the one that gets it just right. Like Apple's Smart Cover, the Ultrathin Keyboard has magnets on its edge and the keyboard latches on to the side of the iPad to fold right over it. When folded up, it is very thin -- ultrathin, even -- just 0.5 inches. The keyboard dock is basic -- there is the keyboard with a slot above it in which to stand the iPad. The plastic keys are very comfortable, but, like the Zagg, it has a shrunken Delete key. Also, because the panel is thin the keys don't depress as much as on other keyboards. Still, I was able to type fairly quickly at 71 words per minute. There are also dedicated function keys and a large space bar. For $99 I found it to be the best blend of all of the units I tested. Words Per Minute: 43 Clamcase TouchFire ($49.99) This isn't really a keyboard dock or a full keyboard, but it is a typing companion for the iPad. The Touchfire is a piece of transparent rubber you can put over the touch keyboard on the iPad's screen to give you physical feedback when you type. The rubber (yes, it sounds and even looks like a condom) has imprints of keys to make them easier to find for touch typists -- those who don't have to look at the keyboard while typing. It's an interesting concept, but I just couldn't type as fast on it as the others. Actually, my words-per-minute count on the Touchfire -- 43 -- was only about half what I got from other keyboards. Also, when you change screens on the iPad -- away from one that doesn't have the keyboard -- you have to remove the keyboard from the screen. Touchfire does compensate for that with magnets that clip on to the side of the iPad and onto a smart cover, but it's still an extra step. It is priced at $50, less than its competitors, but that's actually a lot for a piece of rubber, and I would say the others are worth the extra money. Logitech What to Buy? After spending time with each of the options above, I came away liking the Logitech Ultrathin the most. For $99, it has the best mix of portability, comfort, and build for the price. The ZaggFolio is also a good choice, as is the Apple Keyboard if you aren't looking for high portability. Now, go get some work done.

News Opinion Entertainment Taiwan Living Learn English E-Newsletter App International Edition Tuesday March, 7, 2017 About Us Subscribe Advertise Contact Us Taiwan > National Foreign Community National Local Foreign Affairs China-Taiwan Relations Business Arts-Leisure 7 Taiwan banks approved to provide Apple Pay services CNA  March 5, 2017, 12:01 am TWN SHARE CLOSE Blogger   Google+ Live Journal   Plurk Stumble Upon     Tweet A- A+ TAIPEI -- Seven banks in Taiwan have obtained the greenlight from the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) to provide the services of Apple Pay, a mobile payment and digital wallet mechanism from Apple Inc. The first round of the banks approved by Taiwan's top financial regulator, the FSC, to provide the services in Taiwan, are: Taipei Fubon Commercial Bank, Cathay United Bank, E. Sun Commercial Bank, Taishin International Bank, CTBC Bank, First Commercial Bank, and Union Bank of Taiwan, the FSC's Banking Bureau said. Apple announced in early February that it will provide Apple Pay services in Taiwan soon, while no exact launch date has been set. Except First Bank, the other six banks were on Apple's seven-bank list for the U.S. consumer electronics giant to launch the Apple Pay services in Taiwan in an initial stage. The FSC is still reviewing the application filed by Standard Chartered Bank, which has been on the Apple initial bank list, the bureau said. As of the end of January, the seven banks approved by the FSC to provide the Apple Pay services had issued 25.38 million credit cards which were used in the local market, accounting for more than 62 percent of the total 40.48 million credit cards in Taiwan, according to the FSC. But the bureau said that it remained unknown when Apple Pay will be available in Taiwan since it will depend on how Apple will work with these banks. The bureau reminded consumers that they should have an understanding about whether the credit cards issued by the seven banks will be able to be used under the mobile payment mechanism. Apple Pay was introduced on the global market in September 2014, allowing contactless payments via iOS apps. Consumers in Taiwan will be able to use their iPhones or Apple Watches, with touch ID authentication, to make payments, Apple said. It said shoppers will simply need to place a finger on the Touch ID sensor and hold the iPhone within an inch of the contactless reader to make a purchase. When using the Apple Watch, buyers will need to double-click the side button and hold the display within an inch of the contactless reader, then wait for a gentle tap that signals completion of the purchase, according to the website.

(NASDAQ: AAPL)'s iconic founder, the late Steve Jobs, was a visionary par excellence, a trailblazer, a thought leader, a great inventor, an excellent communicator, a marketing genius — one who changed the way we learn, communicate and listen to music. Just like the Bible vests on King Solomon the privilege of possessing wisdom such as no one else has had, or ever will have, there will never have been anyone, nor will there ever be one akin to the one and only Steve Jobs. The man would have celebrated his 62nd birthday last week, were he still alive and had the world not lost him to pancreatic cancer on October 5, 2011. Some of the breakthrough innovations Apple, his brainchild, came out with included the Macintosh (in 1984), the iPod (in 2001) and the iPhone (in 20007) — all possessing disruptive powers. Despite his death, has Apple followed his visions? Did the company, which was close to his heart, pick up the threads of Jobs' visionary leadership? Did Jobs leave behind any unfinished agenda? Related Link: Why Rehiring Steve Jobs Was The Best Move Apple Ever Made? 1. Ready For Countdown — Spaceship Headquarters Though not related to products and technology, this one project was special to Jobs' innovative spirit, as he envisioned it as a center for creativity and collaboration. Just four months before his death, Jobs himself elaborated on the intended campus in a Cupertino City Council Meeting. This one is related to Apple's new futuristic Silicon Valley spaceship campus in the works. The new campus would be ready for occupation by April. To honor its celebrated founder, a theater on the new 175-acre Apple Park campus was named after him. The campus, a ring-shaped building clad in giant panels of curved glass, blends workspaces and parkland, and it is powered entirely by renewable energy. It houses a fitness center, foot paths, research labs, a visitors center and an orchard. Accentuating Apple's obsession with designs, Apple chief design officer Jony Ive said, "We have approached the design, engineering and making of our new campus with the same enthusiasm and design principles that characterize our products." 2. iPhone 5 — The Last Project Jobs Worked On? Apple's fifth-generation iPhone, the iPhone 4s, was unveiled on October 4, 2011, a day before Jobs passed away. It is believed that the next iteration of iPhone, the iPhone 5, was under development even when Jobs was alive, and it was the last project he worked on. Ashok Kumar, an analyst at Rodman & Renshaw, said then Jobs was intimately involved with, and Kumar touted it as Job's lasting legacy. Given Jobs' involvement from concept to final design, Kumar had speculated ahead of the launch that the iPhone 5 would be a cult classic and will have a slimmer profile and large screen size. This was later confirmed through an interview given by Masayoshi Son, the CEO of SoftBank, when he quoted Tim Cook as saying on October 4, 2011, that Jobs was calling the second-in-command to talk about their next product. Deeply touched by Job's commitment, Masayoshi said: "Even one day before he passed away, the first subject he wanted to call Tim Cook about [...] he wanted to talk about the next product [...] That's the kind of spirit a true entrepreneur would continue to have until they die. He was very sick, very ill. But the announcement of their newest product made him live longer. Physically he could have died much earlier. But his passion, his love for his own company and dream, about the next products, that made him energized." Apple went on to unveil the iPhone 5 at a press event on September 2012 and released it on 21st of the same month. True to expectations, it was a radically reformed product with an aluminum-based body, which was thinner and lighter, a taller screen, the Apple A6 system-on-chip, LTE support and Lightning, a new compact dock connector. As far as reception, it received over 2 million pre-orders within 24 hours of its launch, the rate of pre-orders 20-times faster than its predecessors. Following the launch of the iPhone 5s and iPhone 5c, the iPhone 5 was discontinued on September 10, 2013. Going by iPhone sales statistics released by Statista, Apple shipped roughly 275 million units in 2012 and 2013, with the bulk of them being iPhone 5. Recently at a fireside chat at the University of Glasgow, Apple CEO Cook said: "Steve's DNA will always be the core of Apple. Steve is deeply embedded in the company. We celebrate him and we celebrate his philosophy. His philosophy will be at Apple 100 years from now. The philosophy is sort of passed down with every generation. Yes, he's very much at Apple." This best sums up Jobs' influence on a company he founded, nurtured, stood by even amid an ouster from the company and stuck with until his last breath.

Friday’s complaint concerns three apartment buildings – located at 201 5th Ave. N., 621 5th Ave. S., and 401 Pine Street in Edmonds – that are managed by defendant Debbie A. Appleby, of Stanwood, Wash. The properties are owned by three Limited Liability Corporations controlled by Appleby – Apple One, LLC, Apple Two, LLC, and Apple Three, LLC—which are also named as defendants in the suit. The complaint alleges that in March 2014, defendant Appleby told a woman seeking an apartment for herself, her husband and their 1-year-old child that the apartment buildings were “adult only” and therefore not available to her family. The complaint also alleges that at various other times from April 2014 to November 2015, defendants advertised their available apartments as being restricted to adults only. The family filed a complaint with the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which conducted an investigation, issued a charge of discrimination against the defendants, and referred the case to the Department of Justice. “Equal access to housing is essential for all Americans, including families with young children,” said U.S. Attorney Annette L. Hayes. “Particularly in our tight housing market, landlords must follow the law and make units available without discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, disability or familial status.” “The Fair Housing Act prohibits landlords from denying apartments to families just because they have children,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Tom Wheeler of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division. “Many families already face challenges finding affordable housing, and they should not also have to deal with unlawful discrimination.” The complaint seeks a court order requiring defendants to cease their discriminatory housing practices, damages for the family that filed the HUD complaint and any other families against whom the defendants discriminated against because they had children, plus civil penalties. Any individuals who have information relevant to this case are encouraged to contact the Civil Rights Division at 1-800-896-7743, Option 96.The case is being jointly handled by trial attorney Kathryn Legomsky for the Civil Rights Division for the U.S. Department of Justice and Assistant United States Attorney J. Michael Diaz for the Western District of Washington. You can read the full Justice Department complaint here.

We couldn’t figure it out because she was one of the first people to view and she and her husband had great jobs. Now she knows. Reply Laura Johnson March 4, 2017 at 2:14 pm Joy- That is disappointing, but Edmonds is not immune and discrimination eventually touches all of us. We need to take a stand against discrimination and profiling- in their many unjust forms. Reply Alec denson March 4, 2017 at 9:30 pm “not immune to discrimination” – pretty euphemistic way of putting it. Edmonds is one of the whitest places in western Washington.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Apple Caught in another Controversial Story about Supporting Slave and Child Labor in Congo | Main | Apple Still in the Hunt for a Transformative Acquisition to set Apple TV on Fire Prior to the Arrival of the Mobile TV Revolution » March 04, 2017 Apple Struggled in the Education Market in 2016 as Schools on Tight Budgets Chose Chromebooks   Back in 2014 AppleInsider's editorial writer and digital assassin Daniel Dilger took the Financial Times to task on the subject of Google Chromebooks overtaking Apple in Education. Since that time stories have kept piling in with the same conclusion that Google's Chromebook was the top computer used in the classroom. USA Today, 9to5Mac, CNBC, Fast Company and others kept that story front and center over the years along with the statistics to backup those claims. This week the New York Times weighed in with a report titled "Apple's Devices Lose Luster in American Classrooms," based on new education market statistics from Futuresource.   The NY Times report starts off dramatically by stating that "Apple is losing its grip on American classrooms, which technology companies have long used to hook students on their brands for life.   Over the last three years, Apple's iPads and Mac notebooks — which accounted for about half of the mobile devices shipped to schools in the United States in 2013 — have steadily lost ground to Chromebooks, inexpensive laptops that run on Google's Chrome operating system and are produced by Samsung, Acer and other computer makers.   Mobile devices that run on Apple's iOS and macOS operating systems have now reached a new low, falling to third place behind both Google-powered laptops and Microsoft Windows devices, according to a report released on Thursday by Futuresource Consulting, a research company.   Futuresource noted in their report that of the 12.6 million mobile devices shipped to primary and secondary schools in the United States in 2016, Chromebooks accounted for 58 percent of the market, up from 50 percent in 2015.   School shipments of iPads and Mac laptops fell to 19 percent, from about 25 percent, over the same period. Microsoft Windows laptops and tablets remained relatively stable at about 22 percent, Futuresource said. Mike Fisher, an education technology analyst at Futuresource told the Times that "Apple is struggling." For more on the NY Times report, click here.   Google's Chromebook Continues to Win   Futuresource's report that was published on Thursday noted that "Sales of Mobile PCs into the US K-12 sector continued to develop in 2016, with annual shipments growing 18% year-on-year in 2016, reaching 12.6 million units, up from 10.7 million in 2015. The outlook for 2017 is also positive with market shipment growth forecast to remain in double figures."   The number one platform in education was from Google. Their strengths were a "strong combination of affordable devices, productivity tools via G-Suite, easy integration with third party platforms/tools, task management/distribution via Google Classroom and easy device management remains extremely popular with US teachers and IT buyers alike. The rise of Chromebooks has also set new industry benchmarks with regards to average device pricing, with prices reaching as low as $120 on certain projects."   The Rise of Hybrid Tablet-Notebooks   The last point of interest is the report's position on hybrid devices for this year. "It is the area of '2-in-1' devices (devices that can be utilised both as tablets and with an integrated keyboard for productivity applications) that are expected to be the major competitive area in 2017.   Both Microsoft and Google (and their respective partners) have announced a wide range of 2-in-1 products designed specifically for education and are expected to sell for under $300.   The 2-in-1 form factor is ideal for education, providing schools with flexibility in usage. In addition, the technology behind stylus/pen usage has developed rapidly and 'inking' is expected to become widespread and add value to device usage.   Mike Fisher, Associate Director of Education at Futuresource Consulting, added that "PC provider's laser focus on the education sector is good news for schools and students. 2017 will see wide ranges of computing devices, designed specifically for education and at competitive price points, entering the market and vying to be the device of choice for learning."   Though for most school districts it's about tight budgets and this is where the Chromebook usually gets the nod.   Last year Patently Apple posted a report titled "Apple and IBM have launched their First MobileFirst App for Education Called 'Watson Element'," showing that many schools are looking for deeper educational tools and more advanced devices like the iPad.   Considering that the top Fortune 500 companies and now leading medical facilities around the U.S. like Stanford Medicine are using the iPad, many schools will want to ensure that their students are familiar with tools that industry leaders prefer.   Not every school wants to work with bottom of the line tools and so Apple will continue to introduce new iPad models later this year with more software to assist educators prepare their students for the real world.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Smith Mar 4, 2017, 10:00 AM Here One Smart Wireless Earbuds in Best Headphones 2017 The good Lightweight Snug fit Clean design Can be charged in the case App allows for augmented listening The bad Estimated battery life is only 2 hours App connection can be buggy Verdict The Here One smart wireless earbuds are for early adopters eager to experience the future of augmented listening. Everyone else should wait for a pair with longer battery life. 7/10 Very good $299.99 Here One Don't call them earbuds. The Here One ($299) is so much more. These wearables are actually a pair of computers with a set of microphones that can potentially change how we listen and what we hear. Paired with the app, these earphones offer a form of augmented hearing that essentially layers ambient sound over whatever you happened to be listening to at the moment, creating a merged audio experience. Want a more secluded listening experience? Just hit a button, and enjoy your tunes minus a noisy cubicle mate or street traffic. As fun and intriguing as the aural concept is, though, packing a computer into something as small as an earbud does entail some sacrifice, the biggest of which is extremely short battery life. Still, the Here One is like a piece of the near future for a modern-day audience.   Design This is what the future looks like: not a pair of earbuds with the cords lopped off (as on the Apple AirPods) but a device that tastefully combines form and function. The outer shell of the Here One buds is done in a matte white that's accentuated by a pearlescent silver stripe in the center. The part of the earphones that reside in your ear is made from a matte gray plastic with five embedded metal connectors for charging. A small “L” (left) and “R” (right) etched into each respective bud eliminates any confusion when it's time to put them in your ears. Instead of dangling from my ears like a techy take on the hair-gel gag from There’s Something About Mary, the Here One buds protrude ever so slightly from my ears. In short, they're interesting enough to be a conversation starter without being outlandish. When I'm not using the earphones, they reside in their case, which is constructed of the same unassuming gray matte plastic seen on the buds. The part where the earbuds are housed is made of white matte plastic and features four status light indicators for tracking charging progress. Welcome to Augmented Listening As cool as the Here One buds look, the magic doesn't truly happen until you launch the app. After I paired the buds with the app, it was time for some fun. The free Here One app gives the listener a form of augmented or layered hearing, through its six noise filters (Airplane, City, Crowd, Noise Mask, Office and Restaurant).  That meant that as I sat at my desk, listening to Floetry's "Sunshine," I held a conversation with a few of my colleagues while using the Restaurant filter. The integrated microphones in each bud focused on the conversation in front of me, layering it over my music and allowing me to hum along and hold a conversation. I could enjoy my jams without the intrusion of subway announcements, panhandlers and unruly teens. On my way to the subway after work, I switched to the City setting, which let in the ambient noise of my surroundings, including honking horns and errant conversations. But as fun as listening in on conversations surreptitiously can be, my favorite filters were the ones that let me shut out the world. Noise Mask, for example, pumps in white noise to bring the world down to a dull roar. But I ultimately found myself using the Office setting the most. It didn't pump in a bunch of artificial noise like Noise Mask did, but it still quieted the world around me so I could enjoy my jams without the intrusion of subway announcements, panhandlers and unruly teens. In a sound-off with the Apple AirPods, I found that the Here One buds offered much more detail. Unfortunately for me and the rest of the Android faithful, the current iteration of the free app is iOS-only. However, developer Doppler Labs promises that the Android version will launch in the near future. MORE: I Spent More Than $200 on Headphones: You Should Too Audio Performance In a sound-off with the Apple AirPods, I found that the Here One offered much more detail. For instance, I could hear all of the strings as I listened to Blackstreet's "Joy," but those details seemed to meld into the rest of the instrumentals on the AirPods. However, the AirPods also delivered an overall fuller and warmer sound.  When I switched over to Alanis Morissette's "Ironic," there was enough separation that I heard nearly every strum of the guitar as well as the snares. However, the highs on the Here One were overly bright and brittle compared with the more balanced presentation of the AirPods. The earbuds lasted 1 hour and 35 minutes before a friendly female voice let me know that the end was near. Comfort and Stability Unlike when I’ve worn other of the truly wireless earbuds, I've never felt worried about one of these buds popping out of my ears to somewhere out of reach. A simple twist backward into place snugly secured the Here One buds into my ear canals. They even stayed put when I tried to run for the M7 bus. In terms of comfort, I prefer the Here One to both the AirPods and the Bragi The Headphone. Once the Here One buds were in place, I sometimes forgot I was wearing them — well, other than when the music reminded me. Although the Here One fit me right out of the box, Doppler Labs also includes several pairs of ear tips in both silicone and foam.

The earbuds lasted 1 hour and 35 minutes before a friendly female voice let me know that the end was near; about 10 minutes later, the buds shut down. That's 15 minutes short of the 2 hours that Doppler Labs claims the headphones should get. If your earphones conk out in the midst of your travels, the carrying case can charge the Here One up to three times before it needs to be recharged. That's fine, but that meant I was left at the mercy of the NYC subway system and its cacophony before I could get to charge the buds. During my travels, I noticed that the Bluetooth connection between the phone and the Here One would drop out unexpectedly. This happened even though the phone was in my hands and well within range of the buds. Even more puzzling was that the music continued to play. However, I couldn't access any of the audio filters in the app, so I had to restart the app and re-pair the buds. With all the fancy tech crammed inside the Here One, I wouldn’t have expected that to happen. During one call with my mom, she thought I was in the office when I was actually in a semicrowded coffee shop, getting some hot chocolate. Call Quality What a difference a filter makes. Whether I was in a crowded restaurant or walking down a particularly windy street, I never heard any complaints when fielding calls from friends and family. During one such call with my mom, she thought I was in the office when I was actually in a semi-crowded coffee shop, getting some hot chocolate. Although I would hear a faint echo every now and then on my end of the call, my callers' voices were clear and conversationally loud. MORE: Buying Headphones in: Pros and Cons of Every Type Bottom Line The future of audio lies in augmented listening — but it’s not quite here yet. For $299, Doppler Labs has given listeners the power to control how and what they hear. It's pretty heady stuff when you get right down to it. However, less than 2 hours of battery life on wireless buds is no good, no matter how cool your new bionic ears are. Though they don't offer cool audio filters, the Apple AirPods get 5 hours of battery life, as well as warm, albeit sometimes muddy, audio quality. Still, if you’re an early adopter and want to live on the bleeding edge of tech, the Hero One earbuds might be worth the splurge.

As a matter of fact, I'm still pretty irritated with the company over the whole Note7 fiasco. However, as a frequent Tom's Guide reader, I felt compelled to address this article. You seem to think this is something new? Samsung has already released all of these features in their IconX buds. They do suffer from the same pitfalls as the Here One; short battery life and somewhat buggy connectivity. However, they've been out for quite a while and they feature the "augmented listening" via the ambient sound feature which is activated by holding your finger on one of the earbuds for a few seconds to activate the feature. They charge in the case, which, if the pictures included in this article are accurate, the IconX case is way smaller. It's also shaped like a capsule, with no right angles, so it doesn't dig into your leg if you have it in your pocket. The IconX also contains 4 GB of on-board memory for you to store audio files, eliminating the need for you to carry your smartphone with you if you take them out to the gym. They have a sleek, minimal appearance, with no protruding "sticks" like the crude appearance of Apple's AirPods, which like you said before, look like "earbuds with the cords lopped off". Someone on Apple's design team ought to be slapped for that idea. Lastly, they have a bio sensor built into each bud, which automatically senses when you've inserted each one into your ear and powers them on. The sensors also track your physical activity, giving you verbal feedback on speed, distance, duration, heart rate, and calories burned, all reported to you by an audible "friendly female voice" which can be set to communicate in 15 different languages. The ONLY feature I see with the Here One buds that is unique, is the different ambient sound modes. However, at over $100 USD more than the IconX, I see no reason that you'd want to spend more than necessary to have an equal or lesser experience with the Here One buds. 0 Comment Firstname Submit Also for wearables Editor's choice Bose QuietComfort 25 10/10 Perfection $299.00 Amazon Editor's choice Bose QuietComfort 35 9/10 Superior $349.99 Amazon Editor's choice V-Moda XS 9/10 Superior $161 Amazon The Latest On Tom’s Guide News 4 hr Sonos Expands Home Theater Speaker Lineup With Playbase How-To 8 hr How to Turn Off Location Services on iOS How-To 9 hr Samsung Galaxy S5 User Guide Round-Up 10 hr Best Mobile Strategy Games Deals 10 hr Score a Free $60 Gift Card with Your GoPro Hero5 Purcha...

Most recently, it was reported that Apple is considering a “transformative acquisition” in content creation. Many Apple fans, however, have expressed doubt when it comes to the company’s original content efforts. How big of a focus do you think Apple should be putting on original video content? Take Our Poll Mujjo Wallet iPhone 7 Case Apple is already somewhat invested in original video content. The company will debut its realty series “Planet of the Apps” this year, as well as its spin-off of James Corden’s popular Carpool Karaoke series. These efforts, however, don’t appear to be everything the company is working on. Since Apple first announced its original content efforts, however, there has been much debate as to whether or not this is a good strategy for the company. Many Apple users have expressed concern that Apple is neglecting its hardware and software offerings in favor a new, Hollywood-first approach. With these concerns in mind, though, it’s still unclear as to how extensive Apple’s original video content efforts are. A report last year claimed that Apple itself wasn’t even sure how to handle its move into original content, claiming that it wasn’t necessarily willing to commit to the level of a company like Netflix, but also that it wasn’t sure where the happy-medium was. Additionally, Eddy Cue has said in the past that Apple isn’t necessarily looking to compete with Netflix. Additionally, more recent report claimed that Apple’s efforts related to original content are a bit unorganized at this point, with Eddy Cue, Jimmy Iovine, and Robert Kondrk all holding seperate conversations with media powerhouses. Tim Cook puts Apple’s focus original content efforts like this: “In terms of original content, we have put our toe in the water doing some original content for Apple Music, and that will be rolling out through the year. We are learning from that, and we’ll go from there. The way that we participate in the changes that are going on in the media industry — that I fully expect to accelerate from the cable bundle beginning to break down.” Personally, I hold the opinion that Apple should put a light focus on original content and instead direct attention to creating products and platforms on which creatives and companies can produce content and reach the mass market. With the iOS and tvOS platforms, there’s no reason that Apple itself should need to create an overwhelming amount of content. Apple, however, should negotiate with major companies and studios to obtain rights to content and encourage those studios, networks, and companies to develop applications for tvOS and iOS. What do you think? How big of a focus should Apple be putting on original video content? Let us know in the poll above and comments below.

The new Assistant is Google’s version of Apple’s Siri, Microsoft’s Cortana, and Amazon’s Alexa. Although late into the AI game, Google Assitant has one major advantage over every other AI-based digital assistant software: the Google/Android connection. Google, who has been branching out of its humble search engine beginnings for years, bought Android in 2005. This seemingly simple move allowed Google to expand from desktops to smartphones. According to Quartz, Android hit a record-breaking 88 percent of the smartphone market last year. Android’s success can be attributed to partnering with many smartphone manufacturing partners, while Apple’s IOS has a much smaller market share since it is only available on Apple devices. However, the Google Assistant was not supposed to be used throughout the entire Android universe. Google’s initial strategy was to roll out the Google Assistant on Pixel (Google’s high-end smartphone), and Google Home. Google changed their strategy when Amazon’s Alexa made it even easier to shop online. Since Shopify reports that retail eCommerce sales are projected to grow to over 3.4 trillion US dollars by 2019, Amazon clearly wanted to capture a larger piece of that ever-growing market. Amazon pushed to install Alexa in a wide variety of IoT products was Google’s motivation to change tactics, as reported by CNBC. “The U.S. technology giant’s move comes after Amazon continues to aggressively push Alexa onto new devices. At CES, Amazon announced Alexa would be integrated with LG refrigerators and even Ford cars. But it began to step on Google’s feet when Amazon announced that Alexa would be on the Huawei Mate 9 smartphone in the U.S., which runs Android. “Amazon has taken an early lead with Alexa and Google needs to exploit the enormous reach of Android smartphones to rapidly get the Google Assistant into the hands of consumers before they get wedded to the Alexa ecosystem.” [Image by guvendemir /iStock] The race to dominate the AI market quickly forced Google to tap into its huge Android market. According to a report by Pocket-lint, Google has confirmed Google Assistant will be available for Android 7.0 Nougat and 6.0 Marshmallow phones, including: Samsung Galaxy S7 Samsung Galaxy S7 edge HTC 10 HTC U Ultra LG G5 LG V20 Sony Xperia XZ Huawei P9 Google has also released Google Allo, a messaging app that uses Assistant technology. This would allow more Android phones to use Assistant, again increasing Google’s share of the market. One slight issue, according to a CNET review, is that “Allo doesn’t integrate video calling, and it doesn’t have as many features as its competitors, like baked-in GIF support or control over read receipts.” [Image by Eric Risberg/AP Images] As technology changes and evolves, the innovations will continue to push the envelope and try to find new ways to connect with consumers. Google is the king of connecting consumers and businesses. Google’s search engine is designed to be incredibly helpful while selling advertising. Now that technology allows us to shop, search, talk, and work anywhere, tech companies will keep installing AI in places that will increase profits. By 2021, the number of internet-connected devices is predicted to reach 46 billion. In the race to become the leader of voice-activated AI, Google has a clear advantage in its huge Android market. With an 88% of the smartphone market, Google should be the clear leader. However, 9TO5Mac reports that “Apple made more revenue from iPhone in a single quarter than Google has ever made from Android.” So while Google is poised on the brink of dominating the market with its new Assistant, Google’s Android advantage may not be enough to squash its competitors.

One executive reportedly left the meeting with Cue under the impression that Apple is looking for a “transformative acquisition and not just a deal to buy TV shows.” The report also explains, however that Apple’s original content efforts seem a bit scatter-brained at this point. Hollywood executives are reportedly unclear as to who specifically is leading Apple’s efforts, with Eddy Cue, Jimmy Iovine, and Robert Kondrk all talking to different people: “Robert Kondrk, Eddy Cue, Jimmy Iovine, everyone is trying to be the person,” one insider told The Post. “They each want to be the guy, and they’re telling people, don’t deal with the other one.” “Eddy is talking to some people. Jimmy is talking to others,” noted a second insider. “They just haven’t figured it out.” This also isn’t the first we’ve heard about Apple’s in acquisitions related to original content. Last year, it was reported that Apple had approached Time Warner regarding a potential acquisition, but ultimately Time Warner won out. Other reports, however, have suggested that Apple isn’t necessarily willing to go “all-in” with original video at this point, despite making selected efforts. Cue’s meetings with Paramount and Sony come as Apple continues to express an interest in original video content. The company is debuting its reality series “Planet of the Apps” later this year, as well as its spin-off of the viral Carpool Karaoke series. As Apple continues to put a focus on Services, original content would allow for yet another revenue stream as part of that category. Though, it still seems as if Apple doesn’t exactly know what it wants to do when it comes to creation original content. So, as of now, only time will tell what the future holds.   Chance Miller @ChanceHMiller Chance covers Apple for 9to5Mac and contributes to 9to5Google, Electrek, and 9to5Toys.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Apple Invents Next-Gen Fabrics that could one Day be used for iDevice Housings and Beyond | Main | Apple Struggled in the Education Market in 2016 as Schools on Tight Budgets Chose Chromebooks » March 04, 2017 Apple Caught in another Controversial Story about Supporting Slave and Child Labor in Congo On February 15 Patently Apple posted a report titled "Apple's Need for Slave Labor Clearly Overrides their Argument that a U.S. Plant is Impossible due to Supply Chain Issues." This week another shocking report was published by the U.K's Sky News about cobalt mining in Congo that widely uses child labor as young as four years old to dig for cobalt with their hands. Apple and Samsung use cobalt in their respective smartphones and the children get 10 to 12 cents a day (8 pence) to work in the mines. Is that not slave labor? While you can window dress it or simply deny it's even happening, it is what it is: slave labor.   The source is Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt Company, a Chinese firm that is the largest buyer of artisanal cobalt in Congo and whose minerals are used in Apple products.Yet only after the story broke did Apple decide to make a statement that they would stop buying cobalt mined by hand in Congo until conditions improve and child labor is stopped.   If a reporter was able to find out about the conditions of the mine and even film it, then why couldn't Apple have found that? Especially after the searing report by the BBC in 2014 accusing Apple of closing their eyes to child labor and poor working conditions at other mines, you would think that they would have doubled their efforts so as to never be caught supporting such suppliers in the future. But once again Apple has shown their concern after the fact.   The Washington Post reported on this on Friday by stating that "Last year, Apple pledged to clean up its cobalt supply chain, but the technology giant said it wanted to avoid hurting the Congolese miners by cutting them off. Mining provides vital income for hundreds of thousands of people in what is one of the world's poorest countries. Now, Apple says it has stopped — for now — buying cobalt from artisanal mines."   While Apple knew about this for a year, it's only now that the mine was recently on TV for all the world to see that they moved quickly from talk to PR damage control and action. Yet in the end, the iPhone machine must stay on schedule and Apple will do whatever they have to do to ensure they get their iPhones to market. That's the brutal reality, child labor or not.     The Sky News report went on to add that "None of them wore gloves or masks, yet the World Health Organization says exposure to cobalt and breathing in its dust fumes can cause long-term health problems.   Certainly, many of those involved in the mining industry believe they're suffering poor health as a result.   Makumba Mateba has a huge tumor on his throat which he believes has grown because the water in his village is contaminated by cobalt mining.   He said: "We only drink the water which comes from the mining sites after all the minerals have been washed in it.   "It comes right through our village and I drink it and I'm sure it's that which has made me sick."   Becha Gibu, a doctor in the village of Kimpesa, said many of the babies he delivered had mysterious illnesses. You could read more about the report here.   At the end of the day, it's very difficult not to read about this story and see the film and not see it as total hypocrisy from a company who takes up human rights issues in the United States oh-so loudly and publicly. Apple could have dealt with this issue a year ago according to the Washington Post, yet basically chose not to in the hopes that it would all just fade away with the next news cycle. And it did until last week.   While this is definitely an industry problem, most Apple fans expect more from Apple than PR statements and shifting work to another slave camp not under scrutiny in order to get the material they need for iDevices.   But now take a deep breath, look in the mirror and ask yourself: Will I stop buying my favorite tech toys to save the children around the world from slave labor and unhealthy work conditions? If we collectively did just that, the industry would move heaven and earth to address the issue overnight to stop their stocks from crashing.   Yet honesty tells us that 99% of consumers will pretend they didn't see the video or read the story about this issue. The majority of consumers will excuse it away just like the companies do. So before anyone screams at Apple too loudly, will you make the needed sacrifice to help the children in labor camps? I didn't think so, and companies like Apple, Samsung and others know that all too well.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

(AAPL) Apple Music Just Can’t Catch Spotify Apple Music is growing rapidly, but so is Spotify ... and the streaming music leader has hit 50 million paid subscribers By Brad Moon, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Mar 4, 2017, 11:45 am EST Get AAPL alerts: Submit     View All   Popular Posts: Apple Inc.

(AAPL) Apple Music Just Can’t Catch Spotify Apple Inc. (AAPL) iPhone 8 Lightning Port Drama Continues Apple Inc. (AAPL) Posts Best Q4 Apple Watch Sales Ever View All Posts Apple Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) Apple Music is a success by all counts, but one target still remains elusive. Despite impressive subscriber gains since its 2015 launch, AAPL’s streaming music service has been unable to catch primary rival Spotify. And in the latest sign that the competition is far from over, Spotify just announced it has hit the 50 million paid subscriber mark. Spotify Hits 50 Million Paid Subscribers Apple Music and Spotify are considered to be the two big players in the streaming music war. Spotify launched in 2008, giving it a long lead in which to build up steam over Apple Music, which didn’t go live until 2015. Despite that head start — and predictions that after its initial free three-month trial expired, Apple’s streaming music service would see a big drop off of subscribers — Apple Music quickly began to gain obliterate Spotify’s numbers. Apple Music hit 10 million paid subscribers after just six months, a milestone that took Spotify nearly six years to reach. Since then, Apple Music has continued to add paid subscribers at a rapid pace: 11 million by last February, 13 million in April, 17 million in September and 20 million in December. However, despite the rapidly increasing popularity of Apple’s streaming music service, Spotify stubbornly refuses to go away. In fact, rather than stalling or beginning to slip as many expected, Spotify’s numbers have also been growing strongly. Spotify had roughly 20 million paid subscribers at the time Apple Music launched. This week, the company announced it has hit 50 million. In other words, Spotify is not going anywhere any time soon. A Little More Competition While the big streaming music battle has been between Apple Music and Spotify, many other competitors are duking it out for the dollars of music fans. And rather than scare off new entrants, the success of Apple Music led to a big new competitor taking a shot at the business. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) launched Amazon Music Unlimited last fall, matching Apple Music’s basic subscription rates. But Amazon added a twist by discounting the service for Amazon Prime members and slashing it it less than half the regular $9.99 monthly fee for owners of its Amazon Echo smart speaker. Will Apple Music Ever Catch Spotify? (And Does It Need to?) The success of Apple Music isn’t just about bragging rights.

Benchmark results reveal the upcoming smartphone’s power. The battle of the cores has been a long-standing and heated debate, more so in the past few months as Octa-core devices started to enter the scene. Samsung has always been at the forefront of the Octa-core battle, having advertised and marketed their first Octa-core weapon in 2013 in the body of the Samsung Galaxy S4. With more and more octa-core smartphones entering the scene, the question is, is an octa-core smartphone really better than a quad-core smartphone? To put things into perspective, the upcoming Samsung Galaxy S8+ (The S8+ is the internet’s term for the Galaxy S8 with the bigger screen, which, of course, could still get a different name by launch) will be another octa-core beast that will release this year. But will it be better than the Apple iPhone, which only runs with a quad-core chip? Mashable reported earlier that the first benchmark reports for the Samsung Galaxy S8+ has already made its way online via Geekbench and it is already stirring a bit of controversy. Geekbench published this week the first benchmark report for the Samsung SM-G955U, the model that is believed to ship as the Samsung Galaxy S8+, and we’ve got the benchmark scores that are making consumers wary if it’s worth investing into octa-core after all. According to the results, the single-core score for the Samsung Galaxy S8+ clocks in at 1929, while the multi-core score puts it at 6084. For the average consumer, these are all just numbers, well until we put the Samsung S8+ scores beside the other latest smartphones on the market. We have yet to receive benchmark results for the upcoming iPhone 8 (but that’s one crazy guarded secret by Apple anyway) so we compare the upcoming Galaxy S8+ with its predecessor, the premium Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge, and its older competitor, the Apple iPhone 7 Plus. In comparison with its predecessor, the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge, which runs on an octa-core processor as well, you’ll notice significant upgrades as the Samsung Galaxy S7 only scored an 1893 single-core, and 5670 multi-core. The Samsung Galaxy S8+ is set to outperform the Galaxy S7 [Image by Photo by David Ramos/Getty Images] However, if you check the benchmark results for the iPhone 7 Plus, you’ll get an average single-core score of 3469, which is almost twice the single core power of the Samsung Galaxy S8+. On the multi-core score, however, it gets trumped by the Galaxy S8, only scoring around 5752. Understanding how cores work is a nasty job, which Trusted Reviews tried to explain in this one article. But without getting too geeky about it, for the casual tech consumer, multi-core score usually would you give you a better understanding of how powerful a smartphone could be in real world application. Essentially, smartphones utilize multi-cores so that the phone will be able to process more work more efficiently. This means that instead of loading all the work into a single core, the smartphone divides all the work into its cores so that it gets done quicker. This is why even though some like Mens XP would regard the Samsung Galaxy S8+’s single-core score to be a reason to doubt the upcoming device, it shouldn’t really be the case. A good single-core score for the Apple iPhone 7 Plus, as reflected on Geekbench, couldn’t off-the-bat outshine the Samsung Galaxy S8’s single-core score since in the real computing world, most apps and systems would usually make use of the multiple cores, instead of dumping all the work into one core. This means that the Galaxy S8+’s multi-core score would reflect that it will be able to handle computing better and more efficiently (technically) since the way the S8+ uses its multiple cores outshines the way the iPhone 7 would use its cores. How this translates to actual computing and work could still vary, however. The Samsung Galaxy S8+’s better multi-score could mean it could outperform the Apple iPhone 7 [Image by Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images] And if we’re talking quad-cores and octa-cores already, since the Apple iPhone 7 Plus uses a quad-core processor, while the Samsung Galaxy S8+ uses an octa-core processor, it doesn’t necessarily follow that octa-core is better since it has more cores. In fact, as Make Us Of tries to explain, most octa-core smartphones are essentially dual quad-cores at most. This means that it uses two separate quad-core sets, where one quad-core set is more powerful than the other. Why use two quad-core sets, you ask? Well, the very basic way to understand is that the smartphone would delegate a set of task to the quad-core set that is most fitted for the job. If the work that needs to be completed by the smartphone, for example, only needs low power, for example messaging or just browsing your phone, the task(s) will be delegated to the lower-power quad-core set. If you need more power, i.e. gaming or HD video-viewing, then that task(s) will be delegated to the higher power quad-core set. The catch is that you get to prolong your battery life since the smartphone doesn’t need to make the more powerful quad-core set work, which uses more battery power when you just need this level of power to accomplish a certain task. In fact, if you compare some octa-core smartphones to the iPhone 7 Plus’ quad-core score, you’ll be surprised at how better the quad-core iPhone 7 Plus could perform against the octa-core. The Xiaomi Redmi 3s, for example, is an octa-core device, but can only clock in a 1672 multi-core score. The Huawei Honor 8, which is another octa-core device, only performs almost as well as the iPhone 7 Plus, achieving a multi-core score of 5471. In theory, based on how cores work and benchmark results, the upcoming Samsung Galaxy S8+ could easily outmaneuver the Apple iPhone 7 Plus. But, of course, we can’t say just yet that the Samsung Galaxy S8 could win this year’s battle of the smartphones since the upcoming Apple iPhone 8, which will be powered with a better processor, could be another story. If reports as Gadgets360‘s could be true, then we could see the power of the Samsung Galaxy S8+ with our own eyes and hands by March 29 during the scheduled “Galaxy Unpacked” event.

M Tuesday, Mar 07 2017 | Updated at 04:10 AM EST Stay Connected With Us F T R Opinion Academics Students Special Reports Sports Finance Tech Career College Mar 04, 2017 12:39 PM EST By Donna Mills, UniversityHerald Reporter Spotify Ups The Ante With Extremely High Quality Songs: Apple Music, Tidal Hurting Spotify and Apple's relationship continues to grow sour as they roll out new features to attract and keep their subscribers. Spotify is launching a Hi-Fi music experience that will deliver extremely high quality songs. (Photo : Mario Tama/Getty Images) Spotify recently hit 50 million paying subscribers, surpassing Apple Music's more than 20 million customers. The former has maintained their top standing due to its well-liked features, and Spotify is just starting when it comes to that aspect. Spotify's loyal subscribers are there due to the streaming service's consistent upgrades. Among those is Discover Weekly, a personalized playlist that showcases 40 songs that fit a user's preferred genre. To "predict" music tastes, Spotify employs an algorithm based on users' play history and download. Discover Weekly was a hit among the streaming service's followers and they only upped the ante by introducing Daily Mix or multiple, never-ending playlists. What sets Daily Mix apart from Discover Weekly is it also plays your favorite songs aside from new tracks that you might like. Daily Mixes contain 75 percent of music that you're already familiar with and 25 percent of new songs, USA Today's Las Cruces Sun-News pointed out. Spotify also offers curated playlists for when you only want to listen to a specific music genre on. You can also check out the top hit songs in your country or even internationally. Of course, Apple Music, SoundCloud and Tidal also offer these types of features, but it may be hard for those streaming services to steal Spotify's loyal subscribers especially if the latter see no reason why they should shift. Apple Music remains as Spotify's fiercest competitor. In August, Spotify reportedly punished artists who are exclusive to Apple Music by displaying or promoting their songs less. Spotify vehemently denied this, but the two companies' relationship continues to grow sour as they roll out new features to attract and keep their subscribers. Apple is planning to showcase popular programs such as James Corden's "Carpool Karaoke" on their streaming service. Spotify, on the other hand, is prepping a Hi-Fi music experience, which will feature lossless CD quality audio, The Verge reported. Lossless audio formats are still compressed, but its special algorithms maintain audio data so it sounds exactly like the original source. WAV, WMA Lossless, FLAC and ALAC are some examples of lossless formats. Lossy formats (e.g. MPS, AAC and WMA) compress audio with algorithms that delete data, meaning it's not as high-quality as the lossless ones. Lossless music, however, has disadvantages. It requires more storage and is usually unsupported on hardware gadgets like phones and tablets. Spotify's Hi-Fi service was tested this week and adds $5 to $10 per week to Spotify Premium's $10 price. Users think that Hi-Fi will hurt Tidal due to its cheaper cost and free vinyl offer.

Apple and Samsung lead the smartphone pack worldwide but impressive growth in the Chinese market has left room for a host of home-grown manufacturers to come to the fore, with China's Huawei now third in the world. Within China, Oppo surged to become market leader last year and it is expanding rapidly in Asia to stand fourth in the world rankings, even if its brand is little known in developed and increasingly stagnant Western markets. A closely related Chinese brand, Vivo, has muscled its way into fifth place globally. What this means, though, is that former Chinese market leaders, such as Lenovo and TCL Communications, are losing ground, and some are counting on retro Western brands to revive their fortunes at home and abroad. Emerging from a sea of indistinguishable smartphones, the showstopper at this year's main European technology trade fair was a revival of the Nokia 3310, its brightly coloured cases and month-long battery life tugging at the heartstrings of erstwhile fans in search of a digital detox. The new phone was launched by Finnish firm HMD Global, led by former Nokia executives and backed financially by Chinese electronics giant Foxconn, which makes devices for Apple and Sony, among others. Priced at 49 euros, the 3310 is meant to appeal to old fans in the West as well as finding a new generation of younger users in emerging markets looking for a good-looking reliable phone. The BlackBerry made a splash at the Barcelona trade fair too thanks to China's TCL Communication, which unveiled a BlackBerry-licensed handset with the physical keyboard many professionals clung onto even as Apple's iPhone revolutionised the smartphone market. BlackBerry Ltd. supplies the phone's security software. TCL, which is part of a group that makes appliances ranging from TVs to washing machines, has kept France's Alcatel brand alive for a decade. TCL-Alcatel is now the world's 10th biggest smartphone maker, according to research firm Strategy Analytics. Lenovo, the world's third largest mobile phone supplier in 2014 when it acquired U.S. cellphone pioneer Motorola, has subsequently sunk to ninth globally but is counting on Motorola as its premium smartphone brand to battle back. The Chinese firm is even open to following in Nokia's footsteps and reviving the retro, flip-top Motorola Razr, which was the second-best selling phone in the world in 2004 and 2005. International expansion Lenovo Chief Executive Yang Yuanqing told CNBC this week that launching a revamped Razr could be a way of bringing customers back to the Motorola brand as it tries to drive into developed markets such as the United States. The Philips handset brand also lives on in India and China after the Dutch firm licenced its brand to Sang Fei, a subsidiary of TPV Technology, which also makes Philips television sets. For now, though, the top Chinese phone makers such as Huawei , Oppo and Vivo, look set on developing their own brands in a domestic market that is still growing even as demand in developed economies plateaus. China accounted for more than a third of the world's mobile phones shipped last year, according to a government report. But as the market becomes overrun with me-too smartphones and margins evaporate, rivals may spot more opportunities to leapfrog by capitalising on familiar Western brands, said Strategy Analytics analyst Neil Mawston.

Frankel March 3 Follow @tcfrankel A boy carries a bag used to transport cobalt-laden dirt and rock at a mineral market outside Kolwezi, Congo, on June 7. A Washington Post investigation found that child labor and unsafe working conditions are part of the cobalt mining process. (Michael Robinson Chavez/The Washington Post) Apple said it has temporarily stopped buying cobalt mined by hand in Congo while it continues to deal with problems with child labor and harsh work conditions. A Washington Post investigation last year detailed abuses in Congo’s artisanal cobalt supply chain, showing how miners — including children — labored in hazardous, even deadly, conditions. Amnesty International and other human rights groups also have alleged problems. Earlier this week, British broadcaster Sky News published an investigation that alleged continued problems in the cobalt supply chain. The Post connected this troubling trade to Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt Company, a Chinese firm that is the largest buyer of artisanal cobalt in Congo and whose minerals are used in Apple products. Last year, Apple pledged to clean up its cobalt supply chain, but the technology giant said it wanted to avoid hurting the Congolese miners by cutting them off. Mining provides vital income for hundreds of thousands of people in what is one of the world's poorest countries. Now, Apple says it has stopped — for now — buying cobalt from artisanal mines. “We have been working with Huayou on a program that will verify individual artisanal mines, according to our standards,” Apple said in a statement, “and these mines will re-enter our supply chain when we are confident that the appropriate protections are in place.” Cobalt is essential for the lithium-ion batteries found in laptops and smartphones, such as the iPhone. Sixty percent of the world's cobalt supply comes from Congo. Apple has said it intends this year to begin scrutinizing its cobalt suppliers like it does its “conflict mineral” suppliers — the tin, tungsten, tantalum and gold from Congo that companies are required by securities law to attempt to certify does not come from militia-controlled mines. Apple said it plans to publish a list of the cobalt smelters, just as it does for its conflict mineral smelters. Sky News reported that children continued to be employed in the cobalt mining that feeds into Apple's supply chain. The report was centered on the former Katanga province of Congo, where Huayou Cobalt operates, although the Sky News report does not specify the locations. A Huayou Cobalt spokesman told The Post this week that it was investigating the allegations made in Sky News story and had asked the broadcaster for more details. Apple said it continues to work with local groups in Congo to improve conditions for workers and stop child labor. And once those conditions are addressed, Apple said, it hopes to resume buying artisanal cobalt. business technology the-switch true Please provide a valid email address. Sign up You’re all set!

Today the Indian Amazon website is advertising a 32GB iPhone 6 in Space Gray on its homepage as a limited time offer until March 7th… AirPods This is quite curious as Apple has never produced the iPhone 6 in the 32GB variant, nor does it sell the iPhone 6 anymore. So as we noted yesterday about the 32GB Gold iPhone 6 apparently slated for a March 10 release with Taiwan Mobile, these 32GB versions popping up could potentially be new models. However, there are details that suggest the 32GB iPhone on Amazon is a reconditioned phone which is listed at 28,999 Rupees or about $435. Currently the 16GB iPhone 6 goes for 30,399 Rupees or $455 on the Indian Amazon site. For reference you can find it from about $299 in the US, however these are generally all reconditioned or used units. The seller of this Amazon promoted deal is a third-party, E-Mobiles and shows stock available now. There doesn’t seem to be any mention of whether the iPhone is new and the model number shown in the technical details is A1586 which was one of the original GSM models that didn’t include 32GB as an option. The other bit of information pointing to a reconditioned unit instead of a new model from Apple is that this 32GB iPhone 6 has a 1 year warranty from the manufacturer which is strange given the model number as well as the limited time offer. At the same time, it’s rare to hear about reconditioned iPhones with upgraded storage. E-Mobiles does seem to have a positive seller reputation, however it seems a bit odd that Amazon wouldn’t have vetted this deal more closely if either it is a reconditioned unit or the seller is not using accurate information for the product description.

Watchlist | 26 Feb 2017 | Print  | Comment (4) Apple Remote Desktop 3.9 by Agen G. N. Schmitz In version 3.9 of Apple Remote Desktop — the remote management software’s first update since early 2015 — Apple now requires OS X 10.10.5 Yosemite, but provides backward compatibility for communicating with Apple Remote Desktop clients running any version of 10.8 Mountain Lion, 10.9 Mavericks, or 10.10.4 Yosemite. (The Apple Remote Desktop Client comes with the operating system, and version 3.9 will be made available via Software Update to users running 10.10.5 Yosemite or later.) The Remote Desktop admin app also adds support for the Touch Bar on the 2016 MacBook Pro, enables administrators to export and restore an encrypted list of computers and user credentials, and enables admins to use an assistant cursor to call attention to items on a remote screen. Many users are experiencing a problem where client machines fail to authenticate and show the status “Needs Upgrade.” Reportedly, the solution is to go to Remote Desktop > Preferences > Security and select “Allow communication with older clients (less secure).” However, admins are reporting other problems as well, so it’s worth holding off on this update until the community gives it the all clear.

However, many 10.12.3 systems are failing to authenticate to other 10.12.3 systems for no obvious reason. Surprisingly, Screen Sharing is a workaround over ARD as that works (and more curiously on the second try.) Go figure!!! Reply Adam Engst   2017-02-27 17:30 Thanks for the info — sounds like it might be worth waiting for another update here. Reply Glen McAllister  2017-02-28 03:17 Definitely. I just had to restore both ARD Admin app & Client on my Mac to restore the ability to login in to an account different to the one currently logged in as, which is essential functionality, AFAIC. Had to disable SIP to restore the client in Time Machine. Reply Anonymous   2017-02-28 16:52 he he he ... i'm Anonymous again ... lol Reply  Search   Cached.

Apple points to the "housings" possibly representing an iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, iPod and beyond. In fact Apple's Smart Keyboard for the iPad Pro was the first experimental device to be born from this invention.   Apple notes that a device's housing may be formed from layers of material such as fabric and polymer layers. The fabric may be formed from woven polymer yarn. The fabric may be treated with chemicals to improve stain resistance and wear resistance, may be provided with a polymer backing layer, and may receive molded plastic structures.   The fabric may be embossed to create local raised and lowered areas. Housings may be formed from tubes of fabric and fabric that has been formed by knitting, braiding, and other techniques for intertwining strands of material.   Patterned areas may be woven into the fabric, may be formed by placing coatings on selected portions of the fabric, may be formed by embroidering certain portions of the fabric, or may be formed by otherwise locally processing the fabric.   The shapes found in patent figure 14 resemble iPhone shapes shown in previous Apple patents (see one and two).   In context with the Smart Keyboard, Apple notes that "The patterned areas may form labels for keyboard keys, logos, key trim patterns, and other features for an electronic device. Patterned areas may have locally enhanced light transmission characteristics and may be backlit" – a feature that may be coming to a future generation of the Smart Keyboard.   Apple clearly spells out the scope of this invention beyond the Smart Keyboard. Apple notes that the invention covers "electronic devices with structures such as housing structures that are formed using fabric such as a tablet computer, laptop computer, a desktop computer, a display, a cellular telephone, a media player, a wristwatch device or other wearable electronic equipment and headphones."   Beyond accessories, the invention could also be applied to "electronic equipment associated with furniture or a vehicle, equipment in a building, or other suitable electronic device."   Apple's patent application was filed back in Q3 2015. One of Apple's engineers is in fact Apple's Product Design Engineer for Soft Goods and Materials. Another engineer worked at Nike on their Flyknit shoes. Apple snagged Nike's design director Ben Shaffer in 2013, the man behind Flyknit, Considering that this is a patent application, the timing of such a product to market is unknown at this time.   Patently Apple presents a detailed summary of patent applications with associated graphics for journalistic news purposes as each such patent application is revealed by the U.S. Patent & Trade Office.

However, the company has managed to surprise everyone by quietly unveiling a new variant of the iPhone 6. To recap, the iPhone 6 came out in September 2014 in 16GB, 64GB and 128GB models. Apple has now added another gold colored 32GB 2017 edition to the lineup. The catch here is that the iteration has only shown up in Asian markets where it’s being offered with select carriers. This confusing state of affairs means that the new 32GB option is not being sold via Apple channels like its retail stores or site. The company’s still offering up the 4-inch iPhone SE as the official low-end option in Asia. Also Read: The iPhone 8 is coming out later than you think The 32GB iPhone 6 (2017) has apparently been around in China since February. Telecom brand Taiwan Mobile is now reportedly launching the handset under its banner on March 10. The carrier is pushing the device as a special limited-edition promotion and touting the fact that the variation is the cheapest iPhone to ever be offered on its network. This brings us to the price of the 32GB iPhone 6. Taiwan Mobile is giving away the smartphone for free bundled with a TWD 1399 (roughly $45 or Rs 3000) monthly contract plan for 30 months. It’s unclear if Apple plans to release the variant in other countries as of now. Given the fact that Apple itself didn’t announce or publicize the 32GB iPhone 6, there’s a chance it’ll never make the trip to markets like the US. Perhaps the option is meant as a way to attract customers on the hunt for a cheaper iPhone and don’t want to opt for the smaller iPhone SE.

You’ll get the most value by starting at the beginning, however you can also use the series overview if you’d like to go buffet style. Note for regular readers, the already tech savvy, and IT professionals: this series is designed as a resource you can share with those you are helping or for those looking to become tech savvy on their own. How to navigate your Mac with confidence and ease Background, Expectations, & Best Practices Last week we covered building confidence and ease with iPhone and iPad navigation by dialing in to five different features and how they work. We’ll do the same today looking at macOS (previously known as OS X) which is Apple’s operating system for Macs. AirPods Like Apple’s iPhone and iPad which are known for high overall user friendliness with iOS, macOS for the Mac also has the same reputation. However, like I mentioned in last week’s post, even with arguably the most user-friendly desktop operating system, not everything will always feel obvious or clear until you learn it and make it a habit. Let’s start with one of the most useful features for easy navigation on your Mac. Spotlight Apple’s search tool in macOS is called Spotlight. It has been around since 2005 (brought to iOS in 2009) and continues to become more useful and feature rich with each update. There are many ways Spotlight will help you navigate your Mac with more confidence and ease. One of the biggest benefits is it will often be the fastest and easiest way to find what you are looking for, let’s take a look… Pull up Spotlight by either clicking the magnifying glass icon in the top right corner of your screen or pressing ⌘ command – Space bar. Give a try to searching for anything you have on your Mac, or even things that aren’t 🤓. As shown in the example below, typing in “movies” brings up current movies that are now playing as well as files on my Mac and other related items. Double-click on the listed files and items on the left side to launch, or you can also click on the content on the right side of the Spotlight search window. Some of my favorite things use Spotlight for include launching apps, pulling up contact cards, doing math, and finding content when I know the name or what’s included in the file but forget where I saved it. For a full look at all the things that you use Spotlight for navigate to System Preferences → Spotlight. You’ll now see a window that shows all the categories of content that Spotlight will show in the search results. This will help give you more direction on how to utilize the feature. You can also uncheck any category to limit what you see in Spotlight searches. I highly recommend using the shortcut to activate Spotlight (⌘ command – Space bar) which will help make it a habit to use regularly. Menu bar The Menu bar is the bar that sits at the top of your Mac’s screen. By default it’s always there (although you can set it to hide and show automatically in System Preferences → General) and will always show the application that is currently being used on the far left. On the right hand side you’ll find Menu bar icons for specific apps and macOS utilities. Looking to the right after the keyhole icon (1Password) we have Time Machine, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, AirPlay, Battery, Date, Spotlight, Siri, and Notification Center. If you haven’t done so before, click around and get a better feel for all that you can do with the Menu bar. If you’re coming from Windows, note that Preferences for each application is usually found by clicking on the applications name such as iTunes in the photo below. You’ll also find the option to Quit the application in this drop down menu. Dock The Dock in macOS is the rectangular bar at the bottom of your screen with applications and more. It stays visible by default, but like the Menu bar you can change it so that is hides and shows automatically when you hover your mouse over the bottom of your screen (or wherever you have your Dock positioned). One click on apps in the Dock will launch the application. Notice that any application that has a black dot below it is currently open. Right click on an application to get options like Quit and more (to right click, perform a two-finger click on a trackpad, hold the control key and click or right click with your mouse). One way to change the Dock’s settings is by navigating to System Preferences → Dock where you can adjust the size, magnification, position, and more. One nice trick to know if you’re having trouble quitting an app is using the keyboard to press ⌘ command – option – esc. This will launch the Force Quit Applications window. Select the app that won’t quit, and click Force Quit (most times Not Responding will appear next the app having issues). Finder One last aspect to cover for now is Finder. Think of this as your tour guide for macOS. You can launch Finder by clicking the blue and white smiling app icon in your Dock, or by using Spotlight. Here’s a look at a Finder window’s anatomy… This Finder window shows All My Files which is selected from the Sidebar on the left. Take some time to navigate and change some of the various settings like view options, arrange options, etc. to get a better feel for how to modify and navigate with Finder more effectively. You can rearrange the order of the locations and items in the Sidebar list and also drag new locations and folders to it for quick access. Another thing to keep in mind is that you can have multiple Finder windows open at the same time, just like web pages in Safari or other applications. Try the shortcut ⌘ command – N to open a new Finder window (Finder also support opening new tabs instead of using separate windows). You can also click File next to Finder in the Menu bar to open additional Finder windows and more. Do This 1. Go through each of these features another time or two to get a good feel for them. 2. As you continue using your Mac, make a deliberate effort use Spotlight more often to navigate your Mac more and more efficiently and effectively. 3.

The post has since been taken down, but initially included the caption: “How did I end up in the studio with Dr Dre ON THE night his deal went public that he did with Apple 3.2 BILLION!!!!! The BEATS HEADPHONES JUST CHANGED HIP HOP!!!!!!” WATCH: The New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Financial Times reported the story Thursday citing sources briefed on the talks. Beats by Dre headphones‘ annual sales revenues have reportedly gone up to $1.5 billion since the company was founded with music executive Jimmy Iovine began selling headphones in 2008. The deal would include the new Beats Music streaming service, which Apple is likely acquiring to compete with streaming services like Pandora and Spotify after the company’s iTunes Radio failed to impress the industry. Apple’s revenue growth has declined sharply in recent years, and the company only entered the broadly popular streaming market last year — late because of former CEO Steve Jobs’ reported unfavorable opinion of music subscription services. The company continues to be the largest seller of music downloads, but is losing market share to companies like Amazon. Purchasing Beats would mark Apple’s largest acquisition ever. The headphones retail between about $169.95 to $449.95, depending on model and features, and despite many music and sound industry experts describing their quality as “extraordinarily bad,” the brand has become enormously popular as a fashion item among a younger consumer base, and the popular alternative to standard earbuds models. Beats’ success is due in large part to its wide profit margins – despite the steep prices of the popular bass-heavy headphone models, each individual unit reportedly only costs around $14 to produce. Private equity firm Carlyle Group invested $500 million in Beats last year, and valued the company at more than $1 billion. Neither Apple nor Beats would comment on the deal in the original reports, and the briefed sources said they were still in the negotiation stage. Though the companies have yet to consummate the agreement, and it could still fall through, if things go as planned the official announcement could be made as early as next week.

The iPhone 7 successor will reportedly include a USB-C port rather than Apple's Lightning connector, according to The Wall Street Journal. The Apple-designed Lightning port has been the standard on the company's smartphones since the iPhone 5 launched in 2012. Apple declined to comment on the report. Read more: The 20 tech accessories everybody should have The change would mark a significant shift for Apple, which has traditionally made its own chargers that aren't compatible with devices from other companies. Other technology firms, like Google, HTC and LG, have all moved towards USB-C in their devices. Even Apple has embraced USB-C in its updated line of MacBook and MacBook Pro laptops, all of which include USB-C ports only. (USB-C offers faster data transfer and other benefits over previous versions of USB.) Still, the change could be frustrating for longtime Apple users, who may require an adapter to use Lightning accessories with a USB-C iPhone, assuming they are compatible at all. Read more: Everything we know about the iPhone 8 The report also furthers speculation that Apple will offer an iPhone model with a curved screen, as it says the company has ordered enough parts for mass production of such a device. The news comes after the Journal reported in November that Apple had been considering such a change. Nikkei Asian Review also said in August that Apple will release a new iPhone model with a curved screen. This could enable Apple to better compete with rival Samsung, which has been releasing smartphones with rounded screens since 2014. Other reported changes for the next iPhone, which will arrive around the 10th anniversary of the device's initial launch, include facial recognition and wireless charging.

The iPhone will likely ditch the Touch ID button. Credit: Denys Prykhodov/ShutterstockMore The iPhone will likely ditch the Touch ID button. Credit: Denys Prykhodov/ShutterstockApple is expected to come out with a major new iPhone release this year — either called the iPhone 8 or maybe the iPhone X, if the company makes a nod to the phone's 10th anniversary. The next iPhone will reportedly feature an all-new glass design and come with a curved OLED screen instead of the standard LCD display Apple has used for all of its previous iPhones, according to reports. Should Apple opt for this new design, it will mean that the display will nearly cover the entire face of the iPhone, leaving no room for a physical home button. In its place, Apple may opt for a virtual fingerprint sensor that can replace its physical Touch ID sensor, but still allow you to authorize payments via Apple Pay and unlock your device. Instead of working with a third-party company like Synaptics or Qualcomm to deliver fingerprint sensing in its iPhone 8, the company will reportedly go it alone. Apple will use its own Authentec algorithm and glass identification technology from a company called Privaris to replace Touch ID, Digitimes reports, citing sources who claim to have knowledge of its plans. MORE: Apple Has A Killer Feature Planned for iPhone 8 Some reports have suggested that Apple's technology would allow you to tap anywhere on the screen to activate Touch ID, while others have said that Apple is planning a "function area" in its screen that would house the Touch ID features. Opting for its own solution instead of turning to existing technologies as the Digitimes report suggests would be a notable move by Apple. Both Synaptics and Qualcomm have already developed technologies that can identify fingerprints through a touchscreen, which would ostensibly provide a quick solution to Apple's problem. However, Apple wants to create its own technology using its own algorithms to differentiate its iPhone 8 from all other devices. It's a tack Apple has used quite successfully with its Touch ID physical button. Beyond the algorithm and glass identification technology, Apple might also use ultrasound to determine whether a person's fingerprint is authorized to interact with the device, according to Digitimes' sources. In other words, get ready for a big iPhone update this year.

Bloomberg photo by Chris Ratcliffe.   Marie Mawad Bloomberg     Huawei Technologies and LG Electronics are ushering in new smartphones that each hopes will fill a void created by the absence of a new handset from the usually dominant Samsung Electronics Co. Leading up to the Mobile World Congress recently in Barcelona, LG hosted an event to show off its new G6 smartphone with and edge-to-edge display -- no plastic or metal bezel around it. Huawei updated its flagship line, introducing the P10 phone with Leica camera technology and curved edges at its own event. With Apple skipping the gathering as it has in previous years and Samsung introducing new tablets instead of phones, Europe's technology mecca is a prime stage for smaller handset makers striving to become household names. Both Huawei and LG over the past years have gone from low-cost, basic phones to products that rival the features of Samsung's Galaxy or Apple's iPhone at cheaper prices. "As the two leading players continue to battle for the top spot, several Chinese vendors have solidified their position as valid contenders," Anthony Scarsella, a research manager at IDC, said in a report this month. "They will need to find growth beyond their home turf to eventually knock off either Samsung or Apple at the top." LG and Huawei will also face competition from two brands with European and U.S. roots. HMD Global, which has licensed the Nokia brand for its devices, unveiled the Nokia 3 and Nokia 5 smartphones that will each sell for under 190 euros ($200), along with a new version of its Nokia 3310 feature phone. Lenovo Group, which acquired the Motorola handset business three years ago, showed the Moto G5 and Moto G5 Plus premium devices. Sony and Line Corp., Japan's most popular messaging service, said they are considering joining forces to develop devices powered by artificial intelligence. While Samsung and Apple continued to dominate global smartphone sales last year -- with about 21 percent of shipments for the Korean company and almost 15 percent for its Cupertino, California-based rival -- they both lost ground to China's Huawei, Oppo and Vivo, IDC's report showed. Samsung's reputation among U.S. consumers crumbled after the Galaxy Note 7's recall and eventual abolition unearthed flaws in the Korean company's product safeguards, according to a report published earlier this month. The South Korean giant has presented its newest flagship smartphone at or just ahead of the Barcelona event for several consecutive years, though not this time around. Instead, the company showed two new tablets and said its newest flagship will start selling on March 29. Meanwhile, expectations that the next iPhone will drive a resurgence in sales have been boosting Apple shares this month. The latest available model, the iPhone 7, failed to persuade as many existing customers to upgrade as its predecessor did. Huawei, which has vowed to displace Apple and Samsung from the top of the global smartphone rankings in five years, aiming for market share of 25 percent globally, reached double-digit share of smartphone shipments for the first time in the fourth quarter of last year, at 10.6 percent of a total of 428.5 million units, according to data by IDC. For Asian manufacturers, Europe is a good place to start before targeting the U.S., and that may be increasingly true amid President Donald Trump's "America First" rhetoric. Cheaper phones have done well in countries like Spain, where mobile subscriptions are sold without a handset subsidy. In Italy, subsidies are still a core part of carrier strategies, but there are also consumers who buy prepaid packages -- and with them phones that aren't as expensive upfront.

"I knew after being in combat situations that I wanted to do things that will help protect and train soldiers and make it safer for them," he said. Washington Post photo by Bill O'Leary   Thomas Heath The Washington Post     Shahar Abuhazira knows about dark places. He had the dicey assignment of crawling into tunnels to find terrorists as an infantry officer with the Israeli Defense Forces. "These are small and narrow places, a very dangerous environment," the businessman said. Those missions prepared Abuhazira, 36, for his work as the chief executive of a Gaithersburg, Maryland, company called Roboteam. It sells high-tech robots capable of carrying out at least some of the dangerous tasks he once performed, whether for a National Guardsman patrolling tunnels on the border of Mexico or a soldier in Gaza, Afghanistan, Syria and Iraq. "I knew after being in combat situations that I wanted to do things that will help protect and train soldiers and make it safer for them," said Abuhazira, an accountant by training. He also knew he wanted to create a successful defense business. He has ventured into a crowded field against experienced rivals such as defense giant Northrop Grumman and QinetiQ North America, a publicly held company based in Britain. Roboteam's mechanical troops keep the soldier/operators far from the unknown. The machines can snoop around corners, climb up and down stairways, case an empty building, listen for a conversation, cut a wire and even disarm a bomb. Roboteam was started in 2009 and has grown to more than 100 employees, three-quarters of whom are U.S. military veterans. That makes sense: 95 percent of its $50 million in annual revenue is generated in the United States. "The smartest thing I did is to hire only U.S. military veterans," he said. "It helped us to get to the customer by better understanding the needs and developing the solutions that the warfighter will love." Abuhazira said that Roboteam is profitable. He would not say how profitable. The company has sold nearly 1,000 remote-controlled gadgets to governments in 20 countries, including Australia, Poland, France, Italy, Israel, the United States, Britain and Canada. The machines are designed in Tel Aviv and Maryland, and are built in factories in Pennsylvania and Baltimore. Roboteam's big sell is making a tool so simple that anyone can use it. There is no need to have a computer specialist helicoptered in or have an officer assigned to the unit as "the robot guy." The business model is taken from a page of the Apple playbook. "Apple took a phone that is more sophisticated than any other phone, but made it with only one button," Abuhazira said. "They made the phone very simple and intuitive. This is what we wanted to do with robots." Another piece is the ability to adapt the gadget to the customer's needs. Roboteam releases new versions of its machines once a year, similar to the frequent revisions Apple makes to its iPhones. As Abuhazira sees it: "We brought the Silicon Valley approach to the defense market." The gizmos are so light that you can hoist one onto your back. The IRIS (Individual Robotic Intelligence System) robot reminds me of the toy Tonka trunks I used to play with. (My mother took them away a decade ago.) The IRIS sells for $15,000 and is designed to strap to a soldier's thigh. Soldiers toss it through a window or around a corner so the little robot, which is built to always land upright, can sniff out danger on the other side of the wall. The sales pitch is that the tablets used to operate the robots are so simple that a soldier needs zero training with them. "You throw it and just work with it," he said. "You don't need your commander or someone. You don't need a manual. You have one button, and it's simple to operate." Roboteam's timing could make it a fortune. The U.S. military is in the midst of replacing 7,000 robots that it has purchased since the beginning of the Iraq War in 2003, according to National Defense, a publication that covers military business and technology. Abuhazira said that the company six months ago received $50 million from Israeli and Singapore investors that will help it ramp up production to meet the demand and perhaps even get into the consumer market. In addition to the IRIS, Roboteam manufactures two other models. The big seller is the MTGR -- for Micro Tactical Ground Robot -- which is about 28 pounds and sells for $70,000 per unit. The MTGR accounts for around a third of the company's revenue. The battery-operated robot runs for up to four hours and has up to eight day-and-night cameras spanning 360 degrees. There is even a microphone for telling the bad guys to surrender. The soldier can run the MTGR from a tablet the size of a iPad from up to 1,600 feet away. The MTGR is used mostly for tunnels and culvert inspection to find or spy on the enemy. The third big gizmo in Roboteam's arsenal is the Probot, which is essentially a mini-trailer the size of a riding lawn mower. The Probot is designed to carry -- quietly -- nearly a ton of equipment, ammunition or even injured soldiers to places a Humvee cannot reach. The Probot comes with a "follow me" kit that allows the robot to see its squad and follow a few yards behind for 72 hours. Roboteam was founded in late 2009, by Yosi Wolf and Elad Levy. Both Wolf and Levy once served in the Israeli Air Force and came from robotics backgrounds. Levy is the chief executive of the Israeli operation; Wolf no longer works on the defense side of the business. They had an idea to bring unmanned, ground vehicles to land forces. Up until then, land robots were the exclusive domain of specialists who worked with highly explosive devices. They are known as EOD technicians, for their work on explosive ordinance devices. Several of Roboteam's staffers are former EOD technicians with U.S. military backgrounds. Wolf and Levy contacted Abuhazira through a mutual friend, and he joined the Roboteam in January 2012. Abuhazira grew up in a small city south of Tel Aviv and studied accounting and business at a campus in Beer-Sheeva after military service. "I left the military and thought, 'It will be nice to learn business and accounting,' " he said. "I knew I was not going to work as an accountant, but it helps me even today. I have strong financial capabilities." Abuhazira had experience in the military industry. After college, he had worked more than seven years at Bagira Systems, an Israeli company that develops training and simulation technology for the military. Roboteam entered the market with a splash. The first big contract came a few months after Abuhazira joined the company. It was a $9.8 million job to build and deliver 100 MTGRs to U.S. military counterterrorism units. Other contracts filtered in, including a $25 million U.S. Air Force contract for a man-carried MTGR that beat out QinetiQ and iRobot, essentially establishing Roboteam as a player, Abuhazira said. Roboteam released five products in rapid succession and won robotic competitions in the United States, Britain, Australia, Israel, Poland and Switzerland. "The thing I like the most is to support the soldiers," he said. "That's more my thing and not sitting behind a computer and running big Excel files." It also beats climbing into a dark, dangerous tunnel. roboteam Tweet This article filed under: Business Technology Washington Post BizTech Newsletter Article Comments () Guidelines: Keep it civil and on topic; no profanity, vulgarity, slurs or personal attacks.

 Here's why Microsoft's holographic genius thinks it can beat Apple and Google to win the next wave of computing Matt Weinberger Mar. 4, 2017, 8:00 AM 13,273 facebook linkedin twitter email print Microsoft Technical Fellow Alex Kipman using a HoloLens to virtually "holoport" to Mars.TED To hear Apple CEO Tim Cook tell it, augmented reality — the hot new technology for projecting digital images into the real world, Pokémon Go-style — is "a big idea like the smartphone." But to Alex Kipman, Microsoft Technical Fellow and chief inventor of Microsoft's pioneering augmented reality headset HoloLens, that's underselling it.  Augmented reality and virtual reality technology will have a far bigger impact than smartphones ever did, Kipman told Business Insider in an interview.  "The potential of these devices," he said, is that they could one day "replace your phones, TVs, and all these screens." Once your apps, videos, information, and even social life are projected into your line of sight, you won't need any other screen-based gadgetry. Kipman calls it the "natural conclusion" of mixed reality.  That's a leap forward on par with the advent of internet, which changed how people communicated and did business; the smartphone didn't really do anything new, it just put the internet in your pocket, he says. Google, Facebook, Apple, and Google-backed startup Magic Leap are all working around the clock trying to conquer the mixed reality future for themselves. But Microsoft, after missing the boat on the mobile market, is now in the enviable position of being one of the leading players in the nascent mixed reality market, thanks to its HoloLens headset. And Kipman is determined not to squander that early advantage.   Microsoft HoloLens projects virtual images into your field of view.TED While Kipman appreciates the other companies and their work — "we're all birthing a whole ecosystem" — he says Microsoft remains in first place, with the most complete platform out there. Beyond just HoloLens, Microsoft has also been investing in helping its PC manufacturer partners come up with Windows-compatible VR headsets.  Kipman has long been adamant that the HoloLens, currently available to developers for $3,000, will only be released to consumers when it's good and ready, but he says that Microsoft is still setting the pace of innovation. "HoloLens leads the way," Kipman says. The Microsoft advantage Microsoft has something of a history of swinging for the fences and missing. Kipman himself led development of the Microsoft Kinect, which sold about 29 million units before just kind of fading away. But while he says that Microsoft has had its share of "bloody noses" over the years, "they're in the past."  With HoloLens in particular and the overall Windows mixed reality strategy in general, Kipman says, Microsoft has an "authentic structural focus," giving it several key advantages in terms of both technology and how it goes about accomplishing its mission. For starters, Kipman says that Microsoft boss Satya Nadella is "the most product-driven CEO ever," with the vision and foresight necessary to lead the company into this mixed reality future. It's a critical play for Microsoft, as the continued shrinkage of the PC industry makes this a do-or-die moment for Windows. Kipman also led development of the Microsoft Kinect. Key Kinect technology later made its way to HoloLens.Flickr And in terms of the technology, Kipman says that HoloLens is only made possible because Microsoft has been investing in the necessary underpinnings for many years now. Sensor technology invented for the Kinect made its way into the HoloLens; the Microsoft Surface team helps with design and manufacture of high-end hardware; the Microsoft Azure supercomputing cloud helps power the most immersive holographic apps; Microsoft-owned game studios like Minecraft maker Mojang help make it enjoyable to use; the Windows team handles the operating system, and more examples besides. "That's the prerequisite to build a HoloLens," Kipman says.  Versus Google and Apple Not even Microsoft's peers among the largest tech companies have all those resources, Kipman says. Amazon, for instance may have the Amazon Web Services cloud computing platform, but it doesn't have a major operating system, just for starters. Indeed, Kipman says, Microsoft Windows is a big part of the puzzle. It's a popular, commonly-understood operating system that runs on a wide array of hardware, running the gamut from mega-cheap to ultra-premium. That wide array of options is complemented by the fact that Windows lets anybody, anywhere make software for it. "There's not a lot of companies that have done that," Kipman says. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella unveiled the HoloLens in 2015, around his one-year anniversary of leading the company.Stephen Brashear/Getty Images So while Apple may make the best hardware, Kipman says, the fact that it maintains such a vice grip on the App Store hurts the ability of developers to experiment. And while Google's Android is a wide-open platform for anybody to build anything, he thinks that Google is far less experienced in terms of high-end hardware. In the middle, you have Microsoft, which recently unveiled a new line of Windows-compatible virtual reality headsets, starting at a budget $299. Now, Kipman says, Microsoft Windows supports a full range of hardware that goes from the low end, all the way up to the premium $2,999 HoloLens, all compatible with a growing range of Windows software. The new Acer Windows Mixed Reality Development Edition headset, which as you may guess from the name is only for VR developers.Microsoft There's a lot of work to be done, Kipman says, starting with making these headsets more comfortable, ensuring that there's lots of great software for them, and even far-future-looking stuff like making it so you can actually feel physical resistance and even temperature from digital objects, so a virtual ski trip might actually feel windy and cold. More importantly, it's early enough that it's still anyone's game, Kipman says. Having all these advantages "doesn't mean you are going to win, by the way," Kipman says. But if you want to compete with Microsoft, he says, "you better be more focused than we are." Get the latest Google stock price here.

Instead, Apple will most likely use its own AuthenTec Algorithm, which will be teamed up with privaris-glass identification technology with the aim of redesigning its fingerprint sensor. The report also suggests that Apple’s new fingerprint technology for the iPhone 8 will be developed at TSMC’s 12-inch wafer line along with 65nm process technology. The upcoming iPhone’s production is expected to be delayed due to the redesign of its fingerprint tech and will probably begin in September. The iPhone, which was first launched in 2007, will celebrate its 10th Anniversary this year. Apple is expected to launch a significant redesign of the iPhone in 2017. Earlier Speculations also suggest that the iPhone 8 will no longer have a physical home button and is expected to have an edge-to-edge OLED display, a first for the iPhone. The fingerprint sensor on the iPhone 8 will most likely be embedded in the display and it is also expected to be equipped with biometric authentication systems such as an iris scanner or facial recognition tech. While some previous reports suggested that the iPhone 8 may have a USB-C port, fresh reports claim otherwise. Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI securities has claimed that Apple will retain the Lightning port, but enable a newer fast charging protocol which is expected to use the “USB-C type power delivery”. Previous leaks have revealed that the iPhone 8 will feature a 5.8-inch display with about 5.15-inches of display area, on the same footprint as the iPhone 7. Though the iPhone 8 is likely to be the flagship smartphone from Apple this year, two other Apple phones also might launch, tentatively in July, 2017. While leaks have rendered an array of details about the iPhone 8, the actual features can only be confirmed after its official launch. likethis What's your reaction?

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile Apple’s Latest Patent Will Turn The iPhone’s Screen Into One Big Fingerprint Reader By Ramish Zafar Feb 28, 2017 15Shares Share Tweet Submit It’s no secret that Apple’s got a lot of plans or the iPhone 8. The company’s dependence on the lineup as a key driver of its revenue forces it in a tough spot every year. Without the iPhone, Apple simply cannot surprise. To that end, declining market interest in the smartphone as of late has put Cupertino in a tight spot for 217. The smartphone market is as competitive as ever and Apple needs to move fast if it wants to stay on top. Today, the USPTO has granted the company a patent that will allow for remarkable upgrades to the iPhone. Take a look below for more details. Apple’s Latest Patent Will Not Only Embed Fingerprint Recognition In The iPhone’s Display But Also Allow For On Screen Authentication Button free front displays are a major part of iPhone 8 and Samsung Galaxy S8 leaks. Similar rumors have surfaced for both the devices over the past couple of months. Out of these, Apple’s approach is more solid. Initial whispers on the rumor mill suggested that both the iPhone 8 and the Galaxy S8 will feature virtual home buttons. Since then, countless leaks have disproved this fact for the S8. However, Apple’s still going pretty strong. The latest information suggests that Apple will introduce a Touch Bar like feature on the iPhone 8. The bottom of the device’s screen will feature customizable ‘buttons’ that will change in accord with user needs. Now, Cupertino’s latest patent takes the concept further. Today’s patent outlines how an iPhone’s display will be able to recognize a fingerprint virtually anywhere on screen. Advertisement According to the patent, “An electronic device may include a touch display that includes at least one display layer, and at least one transparent conductive layer thereon defining touch sensing pixels. The electronic device may also include a finger biometric sensor carried by the touch display and that includes a finger biometric sensing layer that includes an array of transparent conductive finger biometric sensing pixels capacitively coupled to the at least one transparent conductive layer of the touch display.” So essentially, the entire screen of your iPhone will become a fingerprint sensor courtesy of an all new layer. This will add a lot of functionality and will remove the need to authenticate actions separately. For example, if you’re making a transaction via the Ap Store, rather than prompt you for separately authenticate your transaction, the iPhone will simply recognize your fingerprint as your interact with it. It’s an intersting concept that will take biometrics to the next stage. Thoughts? Let us know what you think in the comments section below and stay tuned. We’ll keep you updated on the latest.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile Apple Granted A Patent For A Digital Avatar Creation Tool For iPhone And iPad By Ali Salman Feb 28, 2017 14Shares Share Tweet Submit It’s not uncanny that Apple files a lot of patents, but it does not mean that the product or service will ever see daylight. Nonetheless, Apple has been granted a new patent by the United States Patent & Trademark Office that describes an editing and an avatar creation tool for the  iPhone and iPad. The patent is dubbed as the ”Avatar editing environment”. The patent elaborates a “virtual environment” in which an iPhone or iPad user will essentially use and app to create a digital avatar. Lets see some more details on the subject. Apple Granted Patent For An Avatar Creation Tool On iPhone Or iPad Apple explains the patent filing as a user’s “alter ego” creation tool. All this will be made possible by a batch of tools available to the user which includes various adjustment options ranging from their eyes, teeth, hair and other aspects as well. “An avatar editing environment is disclosed that allows users to create custom avatars for use in online games and other applications. Starting with a blank face, the user can add, rescale, and position different elements on the blank face, including but not limited to different eyes, ears, mouth, nose, eyebrows, hair, beard, moustache, glasses, earrings, hats, and other elements that are associated with physical characteristics of humans and fashion.” So what will be the purpose of the avatar on an iOS device? Essentially, the self created avatar will be available in all system apps of iOS. In addition to this, third party developers will also be able to get their hands on the avatar using the bundled API. This will allow the developers to add support for the avatar in their respective apps and games. Advertisement As it appears, this is not a new Apple filing but something that dates back to April of 2011. The editing environment patent was granted recently and hence its availability can now be expected in the future versions of iOS. By word, the avatar creation tool will be integrated in the operating system and could possibly arrive soon. As of now, we’re not sure how Apple deems to make use of the avatar. Would it act as a digital assistance or act as something entirely different. There will be more to the story in the near future so be sure to stay tuned with us. This is it for now, folks. What are your thoughts on Apple’s recently granted patent? Do you think Apple will add the avatar creating tool in the next version of iOS? Share your thoughts in the comments.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile  ⋮  Rumor iPhone 8 Could Adopt the USB-C Interface and Ditch Lightning Altogether By Omar Sohail Feb 28, 2017 45Shares Share Tweet Submit Apple has had a nasty habit of killing ports before the public is ready for it and according to one report, it looks like the iPhone 8 might not feature a Lightning port anymore; it might get replaced with a far more advanced port. New Report Claims That Apple Might Drop the Company’s Lightning Port in Favor of the Industry’s Standard Type-C USB Port Switching from a Lightning port to the Type-C USB port on the upcoming iPhone 8 has been suggested by a new report from The Wall Street Journal, showing that the smartphone lineup might adopt the same interface as the one present on 12-inch MacBook. However, what seems to be bothering us right now is that why would Apple go through all the trouble to remove the 3.5mm headphone jack and use a Lightning port to remove that proprietary port and replace it with something else. The removal of the Lightning port would mean that Apple would not be able to generate revenue in the form of royalties from the manufacturers that produce a wide range of Lightning port accessories such as data cables, storage peripherals, and audio products, so from a business perspective, it might not be the greatest of ideas. Advertisement That very same report states that the iPhone 8 will also come with a curved OLED display, but no updates have been provided regarding the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus meaning that these two devices could retain the regular LCD panels that Apple has been using for quite a while now. However, the great thing about 2017 is that all three models have been rumored to come with support for wireless charging, which is a flexible approach to help consumers get over their nostalgia of the iPhone not featuring a headphone any longer. The iPhone 8 is also expected to get rid of the Touch ID interface and replace it with an iris scanner, as well as a ‘function area’ in place of the home button that could behave in the same manner as the Touch Bar on the 2016 MacBook Pro family. Continue to take this report with a pinch of salt and we will update you on when more reports start coming in.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile  ⋮  Software tvOS 10.2 Beta 4 is Now Available for Apple TV 4 By Uzair Ghani Feb 28, 2017 8Shares Share Tweet Submit tvOS 10.2 Beta 4 for Apple TV 4 is now available. This pre-release build is available over the air, and to registered developers only. Fourth Beta of tvOS 10.2 Now Available on the Apple Developer Program Website Having updated its entire beta software lineup just yesterday, Apple left out tvOS 10.2 beta from the scene. Thankfully, the aforementioned software has received an update today and is not currently sitting at beta 4. Interestingly, tvOS 10.2 Beta 4 is no more than a bug fix release and improves performance around certain corners. If you have the software installed on your Apple TV 4 right now, then it’s highly recommended that you go ahead and update your set-top box without giving it a second thought. Just turn on the device, navigate to Settings > System > Software Updates. Install everything that’s available and you’re good to go. Remember one thing though: during the update process, make sure your Apple TV 4 is not in use at all. Just put down the Siri Remote and let the software do its thing first before watching that slick cat video on YouTube. Advertisement Given we are on the fourth beta of Apple’s software, it won’t be long till the final version comes knocking on our doors. Until then, make sure you keep your devices updated whenever a ping comes in from Apple. Wrap Up If you are interested, you will be pleased to learn that iOS 10.3 and macOS 10.12.4 beta can be tried out for free right now. How? The aforementioned software is available to download via Apple’s Beta Software Program. All you have to do is head over to beta.apple.com, sign in with your Apple ID, install the profile on your device, and the new update will be pushed to you over the air. Keep one thing in mind: since you are dealing with beta software, therefore expect a couple of hiccups during usage. It’s something that is to be expected during day to day usage. tvOS 10.2 and watchOS 3.2, on the other hand, are available for developers only. This means you have to shell out $99 on an annual basis to get access to the pre-release bits.

The 40-year-old former marketing executive and lingerie boutique owner founded Theya Healthcare in 2014, after she identified an issue facing some of her customers. “Women would come into the shop looking for a bra they could wear while recovering from breast cancer or surgery, and there really wasn’t anything that met their needs. They might have scarring, or have had lymph nodes removed, or be undergoing radiotherapy treatment or hormone treatment, which makes them sweat a lot. “If you put that into a synthetic bra that you have to wear 24 hours a day, every day for six weeks, it can be very uncomfortable,” Donlon says. So her solution was to create one herself. With no previous manufacturing experience, she found a designer, and established Theya to manufacture a new range of bras made from bamboo, which has antibacterial properties. Comfort and femininity were top priorities, along with features such as modesty pads and front-zip closures. “We come at it from the woman’s point of view from the very get go,” she says. In 2015, then barely a year in business, Donlon’s fledgling company won armfuls of awards, including the gong for Best Innovative Start Up 2015 by the DCU Ryan Academy, and a Bank of Ireland Startup award. The following year, Theya became an approved supplier to the British NHS, covering more than 1,200 NHS trusts in the UK, and was awarded two worldwide quality standards. Even so, she says: “I had dark days where I didn’t know if I could continue, between the stress of trying to find funding, while trying to keep everything running and grow our market. When that happened, I wouldn’t even let myself think negatively. I had to keep focused on my vision.” ADVERTISEMENT Donlon also found herself turning for support to her network of other female entrepreneurs. “I did the DCU Ryan Academy Female High Fliers Accelerator programme two years ago, and met a network of women. When you’re having those dark days, it is really important to be able to see other women who are out there doing it.” Donlon now divides her time between Ireland, where Theya is headquartered, and the family home in France she shares with her husband Laurent, and young son Senan. She’ll be spending International Women’s Day in Paris, at the Cartier Headquarters, which just announced her as a finalist in its Women’s Initiative Awards. It looks like 2017 is going to be another busy year. JOC Julie Sinnamon Enterprise Ireland CEO Julie Sinnamon is one of a number of women using her influence to bring more gender balance into the Irish entrepreneurial landscape. Sinnamon, who is chief executive of Enterprise Ireland, points out that in 2011, just seven female entrepreneurs out of a total 100 were supported by the agency. “Last year we supported 230 entrepreneurs in total, and 63 were women. Within high potential start-ups, women accounted for 17 percent, so although we still have a bit to go, globally only 8 per cent of tech entrepreneurs are female. So we are doing much better than that.” Encouraging more women to become entrepreneurs “is mission critical for Enterprise Ireland – and for me personally as a woman,” she says. Part of the challenge is putting a spotlight on the women who are succeeding as entrepreneurs. “If you don’t see it, you won’t want to be it.” But it is also about creating better support networks, especially at times in women’s lives when it can be challenging for them to lean in to work. “Coming back after maternity leave can be a real pressure point. It was for me personally. “Everyone who has been there will tell you that it gets better, but when you’re in the middle of that tough merry-go-round of constant juggling, it doesn’t feel like it. So it’s at times like that it’s really important for females to have those support networks, in addition to mixed support networks.” The entrepreneurial landscape in Ireland has already changed significantly for women over the past few years, Sinnamon says. “Ten years ago women were less willing to come forward to those networks, but today it’s much more acceptable and women really see the benefits of being able to network with people who have had similar experiences.” Before becoming chief executive of Enterprise Ireland in 2013, Sinnamon was head of global business development, and also worked in senior roles in the IDA and banking. She has an MBA in International Business from New York’s Fordham University and is an alumni of the Stanford Executive Program. The Derry native says admiration for entrepreneurship runs deep in her veins. “My grandmother on my mother’s side was a businesswoman, long before it was common. My father had a business, and my mother was very involved in it. So I think the influence of what we see as kids is key. To me, one of the really important things for female entrepreneurs isn’t the impact they’re bringing today, it is that they will be the role models inspiring the next generation of entrepreneurs.” JO’C Breege O’Donoghue Chair of the Design and Crafts Council of Ireland “Where did you get that?” “This? It’s only Penneys.” Breege O’Donoghue might not be a household name, but the brand that she presided over for 37 years most certainly is. Few things are as Irish as the Penneys humblebrag. O’Donoghue was a long-standing member of the board of Primark – better known here as Penneys – and part of a team (known in retailing as the gang of four) that oversaw the brand’s growth from 17 stores, when she joined in the mid-1970s, to more than 300 in 10 countries, most recently the US. She moved on from Primark last year, leaving her role as head of new markets, although she remains an ambassador for the brand. ADVERTISEMENT However, at the age of 72, O’Donoghue does not appear to have retirement even remotely in her sights. She immediately took up a position as chair of the Design and Crafts Council of Ireland (DCCoI). The organisation is hoping that her experience in international markets will help the council build on the Irish Design 2015 initiative. If O’Donoghue can do for the craft industry even a fraction of what she managed to do for the pile-em-high-and-sell-em cheap clothing industry, then we could soon be humblebragging “This? It’s only an original piece of handcrafted Irish design.” JO’C Jules Coleman Entrepreneur, Index Ventures Originally from Leixlip, Jules Coleman hit the headlines in 2015 when she sold the business she cofounded, Hassle.com, to German company Helpling. Founding Hassle.com in 2013 was a bit of a leap of faith for Coleman, who at 25 had been working for PwC in London for two years, following a graduate placement at Accenture. She took some time out to do her own thing, teaching herself how to code and trying her hand at her own business. Despite some scary moments – a lack of a regular wage when you are living in an expensive city will do that to you – it turned out to be a good move. The sale of the on-demand cleaning company netted Coleman and her cofounders Alex Depledge and Tom Nimmo €32 million in cash and stock. It also put Coleman on a different path. She left Hassle.com in 2016, along with Depledge, but these days, she has another role – as entrepreneur in residence at Index Ventures, an international venture capital firm that backs startups across all stages, from seed to growth. She is also a venture partner at Ignite 100. But you wouldn’t be surprised to see Coleman back creating her own business from scratch before long. CO’B Diplomacy Anne Anderson Ambassador of Ireland to the US If there is a glass ceiling in the dusty, clubby world of international diplomacy, nobody seems to have told Anne Anderson about it. The Clonmel woman joined the Department of Foreign Affairs in 1972, fresh out of UCD at the age of 19, and since then, she has steadily climbed the rungs of the diplomatic ladder. Her CV reads like a long list of firsts. In 2001, she was Ireland’s first female ambassador to the European Union; and in 2005 she became our first female ambassador to France. In 2013, she became the first Irish female ambassador to the United States, prompting Barack Obama to say it was “past time but that he was very glad to see me”. For her, it was a bitter-sweet moment. “Most professional women enjoy the sound of glass shattering. At the same time, one is conscious of the historical background against which this is happening,” she told the Irish Times. “I am very aware of that, that we had a marriage ban in the Irish diplomatic service until we joined the European Union, so there were generations of women whose talent and potential could not be fully utilised.” She immediately set about connecting with the new wave of young Irish emigrants and set one of the top items on her agenda as immigration reform – an agenda that’s likely to get even busier in the years ahead. JO’C Social campaigning Joanne O’Riordan Student and campaigner Joanne O’Riordan is one of only seven people in the world with a condition called Total Amelia, which means she was born without limbs. Not that she has let that hold her back. Her mantra is that “it’s not the disability, it’s the ability.” ADVERTISEMENT Now 20 and a student of criminology at UCC, O’Riordan, who is from Millstreet in Cork, catapulted onto the national stage in 2011, when she memorably tackled Taoiseach Enda Kenny about cuts to the disability benefit. She went on to give a keynote speech to the United Nations about technology, and put a challenge to the tech community to design a robot for her. In 2015, she was awarded the Junior Chamber International Outstanding Young Person of the Year award, and last year she led Dublin’s St Patrick’s Festival parade, making her the youngest ever grand marshal. “I have been around the globe, to New York and Japan, giving the people with a disability in this world a voice,” she said at the time. “I’m incredibly proud to be a voice for the voiceless.” At the UN, her determination not to let anything hold her back was clear: “All my young life I’ve struggled and overcome barriers. I’ve surprised doctors, strangers, friends and even my own family by what I have achieved. I don’t want to live in the shadow of others, because I want to make my own journey in life and I know if I’m given that chance I can and will succeed.” JO’C Sinead Kane Blind marathon runner Sinead Kane is a woman for whom the words ‘can’t’, ‘impossible’ and even ‘pain’ seem to have no meaning. When we speak, three weeks after she completed the incredible feat of running seven marathons in seven days on seven different continents, she is just back from a four-hour training run ahead of her next challenge – a 24-hour run in Finland that she planned to complete last weekend. She’s also in the midst of doing a PhD in Law. Yes, this is the same Sinead Kane who is 95 per cent blind. “I was doing this training run, and I was fatigued. I go through a lot of self-talk. I just said to myself, ‘Snap out of it. This isn’t supposed to be pleasure. This is a job. If you had to put in a four-hour shift filling boxes in a factory, you’d just be getting on with it. So get on with it’.” Because of her vision impairment, Kane runs with a guide runner, John O’Regan. “It’s a very trusting relationship. He knows I get very frustrated in extreme races, and I don’t have the advantage of being able to focus on scenery or spectators to get me though.” In 2015, Kane was successful in challenging the organisers of the VHI Women’s Mini Marathon to allow male guide runners to take part. “I’m always thinking two goals ahead. Some people are addicted to chocolate and some people are addicted to alcohol – I think I’m just addicted to goal setting,” she says. When it comes to challenges, Kane believes there are several still facing women with disabilities in Ireland today. There is, she points out, “a lack of understanding of the ways in which gender and disability issues interact. Women with disabilities are only beginning to become visible and their needs only starting to be addressed within the policy-making process.” Partly, this is down to organisations, networks and groups not being proactive enough about encouraging people with disabilities into their organisations. “I haven’t been approached by any women’s organisation to be patron or to be part of the decision making process,” she says. “Women in general need to challenge their own prejudices and stereotypical views of disabled women.” Completing the World Marathon Challenge changed her own definition of boundaries, she says. “Before, I used to think on a daily basis that I was tired. I used to feel cold when it was 10 degrees in Ireland. Now I know I can stand running at minus-30 in Antarctica, I feel that anything is possible.” JO’C ADVERTISEMENT Sinéad Burke PhD candidate, teacher, public speaker, writer Burke is a PhD candidate, primary school teacher, public speaker, broadcaster, blogger, fashion obsessive, and more. As winner of the final Alternative Miss Ireland title, she used her experience as a “little person” to her advantage, with her character creation Minnie Mélange, also the title of her blog. As an inspirational speaker, Burke is just that. Her talks on confidence, carving out one’s own career path, defying expectations, and becoming your best self, bring full conference and lecture rooms to attentive silence. Burke is an exceptional speaker, calm, clear and captivating. Last year, she took that style of delivery to the Late Late Show audience, with a well-received appearance on the chat show. Burke writes about fashion with a lyrical style. “Clothes are a malleable armour,” she wrote in the Irish Times, “defending us from the elements, our own emotions and others”. It’s that thoughtfulness that encapsulates her attitude. UM Technology Sinead McSweeney Twitter Ireland MD Sinead McSweeney is used to working in male dominated environments. Before she joined Twitter four and a half years ago, she worked for An Garda Siochana as director of communications; prior to that, she had a stint with the PSNI in a similar role, and spent some time in politics. She took on the role of vice president of public policy and communications before landing the managing director’s role in December. But despite the tech industry’s reputation for being somewhat imbalanced when it comes to gender representation, Twitter Ireland’s newest managing director says things are definitely improving – particularly when it comes to leadership roles in Ireland. “My eras of being the only woman in the room are behind me,” she said. “For years I’d be the only woman in the room and the youngest. That rarely happens now.” The tech sector may be under the spotlight right now but it’s by no means the only industry with the problem. Eight years in policing has taught McSweeney that diversity is a constant theme. “Increasingly if you look across technology, particularly in Ireland and across leadership, it’s becoming female dominated,” she said. “I think we need to be careful of the male dominated narrative; that becomes an obstacle in itself.” She concedes that some roles are more male dominated, but it is a tide that hopefully stays on the turn. The company – and its new MD – is committed to supporting diversity within its ranks. Resilience and respect are the two most important things to bring to the leadership role, especially when it comes to supporting diversity and discouraging any behaviour that would threaten that, whether it is down to gender, sexual orientation, religious beliefs, and so on. The example comes from the top. “You have to make it clear there is low tolerance for any of that behaviour,” she said While Twitter offers support in the form of various training – from unconscious bias to resilience training – and groups that can support different people within the workforce, McSweeney makes one important point: things start much earlier than applying for a job. “People have to want to work in an industry. The seeds are sown a long time before they fill out an application form,” she said. That means changing the perception of careers in the tech industry, something that has been a focus in recent years. “Technology is not alone in facing the diversity challenge,” she said. CO’B Cathriona Hallahan Microsoft MD When Cathriona Hallahan started in Microsoft, it was as an accounting technician around 30 years ago. The firm was just getting established in Ireland, and Hallahan was one of the first employees through the door; there were only 24 employed at the company. Since then, she has seen the company grow to more than 1,500 and it’s set to grow further, with 600 people set to join the firm in the coming months as Microsoft opens its new inside sales operation here and expands its existing operations. ADVERTISEMENT In February 2013, she took over as managing director of Microsoft Ireland when Paul Relis stepped down from the role, adding to the ranks of tech companies that had appointed Irish women to top jobs. She has never wanted to be seen as the token women though – something she has been spoken about in the past. And who would want to be? Everyone wants to be recognised for their own talents. She certainly has been. In 2014, she was named Image Magazine’s CEO businesswoman of the year, inducted into the Women’s Executive Network Hall of Fame in 2015 and is a member of the International Women’s Forum. Hallahan was also sponsor for diversity and inclusion at Microsoft for the Irish operation for a number of years, so has been at the coalface, so to speak. “What you find is women are a lot slower to take those risks. They feel like they have to be over qualified for the job before they’ll put themselves forward,” she says. “I’ve seen the unique perspective that women can bring to the boardroom. I think they have a different thought process, their style is much more inclusive, they like to listen to different perspectives before they’ll make a decision. “When I think about diversity I think about styles, opinions, not just gender. It’s about having unique perspectives, bringing people from different industries into the boardroom that can offer a different way of looking at a problem, and finding a unique solution.” That is something that Hallahan has been trying to push within her own organisation – having the confidence to put yourself forward, take opportunities and self promote. CO’B Helen Dixon Data protection commissioner Ireland’s Data Protection Commissioner was always going to have a tough job. With some of the biggest tech companies in the world locating their European operations here and attention turning to how data privacy was being treated, there was bound to be some difficult days ahead. The office is essentially responsible for the protection of the personal data of hundreds of millions of European citizens. No pressure there. Dixon took up the role in 2014, when outgoing commissioner Billy Hawkes departed. She is the first woman to hold the position. With it came a pending case by Austrian privacy campaigner Max Schrems over Facebook and ultimately a battle over the transfer of data between Europe and the US that led to the striking down of the Safe Harbour agreement between the two territories. Before taking up the Data Protection Commissioner’s role, Dixon was Irish Registrar of Companies, and previously with positions in the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation in the areas of economic migration policy, and science, technology and innovation policy. But she also had an insight into how things work in multinationals, thanks to 11 years in two US multinationals based here. And she’s no stranger to taking on difficult tasks. She has a degree in Applied Languages, a Masters in European Economic and Public Affairs, a Masters in Governance, a Postgraduate Diploma in Computer Science, a professional Diploma in Official Statistics for Policy Evaluation and also successfully passed all eight subjects of the FE-1 Final Examination of the Law Society of Ireland in one year. It makes you tired just thinking about it. CO’B Cathy Kearney Apple VP European Operations Cathy Kearney isn’t one to hog the limelight. You rarely see her name in newspapers, and she isn’t a regular on the conference circuit. But she still ranks as one of the country’s most important business figures, heading up Apple’s operations in Cork. Kearney, a Cork-based accountant, has a number of job titles, including vice president of operations for Apple Distribution International, a role she took up in 2012, and director of operations at Beats Electronic Services, which came after the $3 billion acquisition of the firm in 2014. ADVERTISEMENT Not a lot was known about Apple’s operations in Cork until recent years, despite the fact the company has been in operation here since 1980. But all that has changed, first with Apple’s decision to lift a bit of the veil of secrecy surrounding the Irish operation, which employs around 5,000 people. Kearney has been thrust into the spotlight somewhat, thanks to the investigation into Apple’s European tax affairs. Not only has she appeared before a private session of US senate officials, she has also spoken to the European Parliament’s Special Committee on Tax Rulings. And she was widely reported as being the woman responsible for saving Apple billions of dollars – though it’s not known if she is happy with that assessment. She was also honoured by UCC in 2015, as part of the university’s Alumni Awards. CO’B Sonia Flynn Soundcloud VP Originally from Kildare, SoundCloud’s international vice president Sonia Flynn started out on a less traditional route into the tech industry. A degree in Applied Languages from the University of Coleraine was followed by a masters in German literature from Queen’s University Belfast. But an almost five-year stint in Google Ireland, ending with her final appointment as EMEA director of user operations led to a career with Facebook in 2009, with Flynn joining as director for community operations. In 2011, she took over as managing director of Facebook in Ireland, and steered the company through its years of growth here. But the lure of the more creative sector proved to have a lot more pull for Flynn. The chance to combine a passion for music and a love for technology led to the SoundCloud move in 2015, and a relocation to Berlin. The platform enables its users to upload, record, promote and share their originally-created content, and Flynn was tasked with growing it, much in the same way as she oversaw expansion in her previous roles. In between all that, Flynn has also found time for a business of her own – Roller, a blow dry bar located in Dublin’s Docklands area, in the heart of tech industry – still connected to the tech world but with its roots in the real one too. CO’B Sport Sene Naoupu Rugby player In a short space of time, Naoupu has become a key player for the Irish women’s rugby team, and also an integral part of the Sevens team, which at times for those players involved in both camps, leads to controversial decisions such as pulling Naoupu, along with two of her teammates, from this year’s Six Nations campaign to compete in the Sevens in Las Vegas instead. As a centre, her speed, vision, and excellent set of second-nature skills, make her a ferocious force on the pitch. Technically gifted, strong and fast, Naoupu won the Women’s Player of the Year trophy at 2016 at the Rugby Writers of Ireland Awards. New Zealand-born, with Samoan parents, Naoupu moved to Ireland with her husband George, who played for Connacht before moving to Harlequins. She has spoken about overcoming anorexia, and it is that mental strength that seems to typify both her personality, fitness training work, and of course her rugby. With the World Cup in Ireland this August, and plenty of eyes on the host team, Naoupu is set to shine. UM Sarah Keane President of the OCI After a chaotic 2016, the Olympic Council of Ireland (OCI) desperately needed a safe pair of hands. Enter Sarah Keane, the CEO of Swim Ireland, who beat acting president Willie O’Brien and CEO of Basketball Ireland Bernard O’Byrne to the post Pat Hickey had vacated. ADVERTISEMENT Keane became president of the OCI in February. Previously the CEO of Swim Ireland since 2004, she is now effectively the most powerful woman in Irish sport. A lawyer, water polo international, OCI and Federation of Irish Sport board member, Keane was also at the centre of managing the fallout from the Rio Olympics ticketing scandal, as one of three people on the OCI’s crisis management committee. Keane said she felt “humbled and privileged” upon her election, and it is certainly seen as a changing of the guard, as a woman who represented that change, conclusively winning 29 out of 43 votes. Keane will serve a four-year term, and with a damaged brand to repair in the public’s eyes, a fresh face with a legal background will go some way to refresh the organisation. UM Entertainment & Arts Ruth Negga Actor Irish actors have always excelled, but perhaps none in recent times with the grace and subtly of craft of Ethiopian-Irish Ruth Negga. Her remarkable performance in Loving earned her an Oscar nomination as well as seven award wins, and BAFTA Rising Star, Golden Globe, Critics’ Choice and other nominations. Negga’s rise has been gradual, yet every performance has been worthy of praise, from Misfits to Marvel’s Agents of SHIELD. Her Loving performance also landed her on the cover of US Vogue’s January issue this year, and endless plaudits from the fashion world for her unique style in a world of dressing-by-committee. She also currently stars in the AMC series Preacher with Dominic Cooper. “I became an actor to hide,” Negga told Donald Clarke in a recent interview in The Irish Times, “You oscillate between being really tough – warding off hurt – when you’re told you’re not good enough to having this really translucent skin, so you can absorb people and their vibrations. So you can do your job basically. It’s no wonder we’re all so peculiar.” Having now ‘arrived’, being set up for stardom after such a trajectory working in Ireland, Britain and the US, there is a calmness about Negga’s disposition in such a heady industry. “I don’t think I was prepared for how much I have to talk about myself,” she said in that interview. She will probably have to get used to that. UM Louise O’Neill Author Cork woman Louise O’Neill’s first two novels, Only Ever Yours, and especially Asking For It, remoulded the young adult literature landscape. She has won countless awards for her writing including Newcomer of the Year in 2014 at the Irish Book Awards and Book of the Year the following year. Asking For It was named a Printz Honor Book by the American Library Association. Outside of fiction, she is a passionate advocate for women’s rights and a mature conversation around sexual consent. Advice that sticks with O’Neill is, “What other people think of you is none of your business,” she says. “In a career like writing, you have to build up a residence, you can’t worry what people think, that paralysis you have when you’re trying to be honest in your writing.” O’Neill says she had to let go of other people’s perceptions of her, “and just really focus more on how I felt about myself and creating a career that felt meaningful and fulfilling for me, disregarding what looked impressive and cool from the outside”. O’Neill speaks about trying to shed that pressure of perception. “It’s just trying to let go of that need to be liked. Who cares? Who cares about strangers? All that matters is [that] your friends and family like you. Hopefully they do, I haven’t asked them recently!” ADVERTISEMENT For O’Neill, ambition is “one of the strongest driving forces” in her life. “When I was younger I felt ambition was a dirty word, particularly for women. When I moved to New York, I learned very quickly that by being self-deprecating ... they had no time or patience for that and they sort of discounted you. I needed to admit to myself that it was okay to be ambitious. That’s been very useful for my career. Self-promotion is an important part of being an author now, and I know that can be hard for Irish people, but I don’t have a problem with it.” As for future plans, “I just want to keep getting better, keep pushing myself as an artist. There was a Facebook memory today on my timeline from three years ago and it said, ‘Did I tell you all about how I’m going to be nominated for an Oscar? Probably best adapted screenplay, but I’m flexible. 2018 is my deadline.’ That might be pushing it.” Maybe not. The film and TV rights to Only Ever Yours were bought by Killer Content in the US, and the TV rights to Asking For It were acquired by Bandit in the UK. UM Annie Mac Radio and TV presenter and DJ BBC Radio star, Other Voices presenter, the front woman of several documentaries, tastemaker, DJ, and more, Annie Mac is one of the most significant people in British radio and dance music. Her name now a brand. Her Annie Mac Presents (AMP) brand, which has hosted live concerts, tours, and released compilation albums, has also developed an entire festival, called Lost & Found, in Malta. A regular across the British festival calendar, she draws big crowds at Glastonbury, and her laid back but remarkably astute selection choices endear her to a wide range of fans increasingly likely to hop from genre to genre in their fandom. Presenting on BBC Radio 1 five days a week, the BBC champion her as a successor to John Peel and Zane Lowe, given her ear for quality new music. Her latest documentary for BBC Three examined the closure of nightclubs across the UK, and she previously presented the Channel 4 series Superstar DJs. Her gradual yet lofty climb through the ranks has also been typified by hard work and a top attitude. Is there a more influential Irish person working in radio anywhere in the world right now? UM Sharon Horgan Writer, producer, actor, director Writer, producer, actor, director, the woman who Caitlin Moran calls “a f***ing goddess”, Sharon Horgan broke America with the Emmy-nominated Catastrophe and secured a second season of her HBO show Divorce. Last year’s pilot of Motherland, written with Graham and Helen Linehan and Holly Walsh, was brilliant. Before those, her collaboration with Dennis Kelly birthed Pulling, and with Holly Walsh she created Dead Boss, which she also co-wrote and starred in. But it was her teaming up with Rob Delaney for Catastrophe that brought her work to a wider audience around the world. It confirmed her status as one of the biggest talents in television and comedy in Britain, and crucially showed American audiences how to make TV about real life love. Her production company Merman is working on several film and television projects, and she recently took on an animation acting project, as the voice of Minerva Mertens in Cartoon Network’s Adventure Time. Acknowledged by her peers as a ferociously disciplined and dedicated worker, Horgan confesses to “an in-built awkwardness, plus a healthy kind of cynicism and, like, a bit of a sneery head on me. It’s easier to stand back and look at situations and have something funny to say about them. I don’t think I’ve ever found myself in any social engagement or situation where I’ve felt comfortable, or where I’ve felt ‘these are my people’ or ‘this is where I should be’. I’m always awkward”. UM ADVERTISEMENT Marian Keyes Author Fifteen novels, five non-fiction books, more than 33 million copies of her books sold, Keyes is undoubtedly one of the most successful Irish writers of all time. Her honesty and strength in dealing with depression and alcoholism has inspired as much as her books are loved, and her chatty but acutely smart writing style has launched a thousand copy cats. This hilarious and warm banter has migrated on to Twitter, providing insights into her love of Strictly Come Dancing and restoring furniture. Speaking at an Irish Times Women’s Podcast event recently, Keyes said, “I had no idea I was funny until I was in my 30s and I started going to AA meetings … I was telling people all these awful stories and they were roaring laughing. I realised I was hilarious and thought, ‘Jesus maybe I’ve a bit of a gift for this’.” Later this year, she will publish a new, much anticipated novel, The Break, about a husband who ups and leaves. Striving to be ‘the next Marian Keyes’ has become shorthand for massive global success and adoration from readers, yet somehow, despite her prominence on the literary landscape, she has remained as down-to-earth and familiar as the characters she so expertly draws. UM Stefanie Preissner Screenwriter, playwright and actor Overnight success stories in the Irish entertainment world are as rare as … well, RTÉ comedy series appreciated by millennials and their parents alike. But the whipsmart and hardworking Stefanie Preissner apparently managed to pull off both in 2016, with the runaway success of Can’t Cope, Won’t Cope, her six-part comedy-drama series about, as she said, “women who are difficult and make bad decisions and [ARE]vulnerable and endearing”. In fact, she wasn’t really an overnight success: the 28-year-old Munich-born, Mallow-raised writer and actor had been grafting steadily, often getting up at 4.30am to write, since she left the Gaiety School of Acting in 2012. Her earlier work includes a sell-out Irish run of her play Solpadeine Is My Boyfriend, which also went on national tour in Bucharest, Edinburgh and Australia, and eventually became a hugely popular podcast. Preissner’s great gift to young Irish women is to show them versions of themselves they can actually relate to, as opposed to what she has called “a real fetishised version of youth, a real glamorised version of going out for the night and having sex with people and then meeting up for brunch the next day and dissecting it over avocados”. It’s shaping up to be another busy year for her. Can’t Cope, Won’t Cope is back for a second series, and was recently acquired by BBC3. Her first book, Why Can’t Everything Just Stay the Same? (and other things I shout when I can’t cope), is out in the autumn. JO’C Design Yvonne Farrell and Shelley McNamara Architects Farrell and McNamara co-founded Grafton Architects in the late 1970s, and set about redefining what Irish architecture could be. The boldness and sophistication of their designs have won prestige, awe, and fans in equal measure. Imaginative, challenging, and very often simply outstanding, their architecture dots the Irish landscape, from the Solstice Arts Centre in Navan to the University of Limerick Medical School, but it is the scale and impact of their projects abroad that has brought Grafton Architects global acclaim. They won the World Building of the Year Award in 2008 for Universita Luigi Bocconi in Milan, and the RIBA International Prize in 2016 for the stunning UTEC University campus in Lima. Lord Richard Rogers, chairing the RIBA jury for the prize, described the building as “modern day Machu Picchu”. ADVERTISEMENT Farrell and McNamara are also both elected members of Aosdána. They are currently working on, among other things, a new School of Economics for University Toulouse 1 Capitole, the new Paul Marshall Institute for the London School of Economics, and the Parnell Square Cultural Quarter Project in Dublin. In 2018, Farrell and McNamara will curate the 16th Venice Architecture Biennale. UM Fashion & beauty Marissa Carter Entrepreneur and Cocoa Brown CEO Five years ago, Cocoa Brown Tanning was still just a big idea by its creator, then beauty salon owner Marissa Carter, who came up with it while on maternity leave. The first batch was bottled in November 2012 and today, four bottles of the product are sold every minute across the globe. “We have 10,000 stockists around the word, in Scandinavia, Australia, the UK and Ireland. The next step is opening a US office in New York. We have a distributor, and in June myself and my husband Ronan (who joined the company six months ago, as CFO) are moving to New York, with our two little ones and the dog,” she says. Carter says mentoring from other women has been a key factor in helping her to succeed. “A woman is much more likely to set up her own business if she has a mentor or a fellow female in business advocate. If you see someone else succeeding it makes you think, ‘that could be me, if she can do it, why can’t I?’,” she says. Carter, who is a graduate of Enterprise Ireland’s Going for Growth programme aimed at female entrepreneurs, now does a lot of formal and informal mentoring and speaking to other women. Her advice to other women is that you can never be over-prepared. “I’ve always loved learning, so I try to educate myself enough so that I can be the best I can. With knowledge comes confidence – the more of an authority I am on something, the more confident I feel, and the better I deliver.” Carter is aware that she has the opportunity to be a role model for her predominantly young client base, and it is not a responsibility she takes lightly. “So many of my customers are on social media, and they’re following my story, so I feel a responsibility to them. I’m aware that young girls are watching me, so I always try to give out the message that self-confidence is one of the most important factor for success. Growing up, I think my Mum really did always try and instil in me that I was capable, above all else.” The rest of her success, she admits, may be down to genes. “I was probably born cocky. To survive in business, you need thick skin and you need steel in your bones, and you need to be able to take rejection with a pinch of salt, because you’re always going to come across no more than yes.” JOC Ruth Curran Global Chair of IIC Partners Organiser of one of Ireland’s biggest annual charity fashion shows and passionate about Irish fashion and supporting young and up and coming designers, Ruth Curran has raised much needed funds for the National Maternity Hospital and last year’s star studded event at the Royal Hospital in Kilmainham was another sell out success, attracting ticket sales and sponsorship of over €50,000. Global Chair of IIC Partners, one of the largest executive search firms in the world, Curran travels widely internationally and was last year awarded Galway University’s Business and Commerce Alumni of the Year. She is also on the board of the university, chairs its academic planning and resource committee and is proud of the fact that NUIG is the only university that has consistently risen in the highly competitive World University Rankings. ADVERTISEMENT An accountant from a distinguished academic family in Galway, she has a Masters in Business from the UCD Michael Smurfit Graduate Business School and a Bachelor of Commerce degree from NUIG. Before she joined MERC, the Irish arm of IIC in 1999, she worked for Consolidated Press Holdings, one of Asia Pacific’s largest media organisations. Her job entails finding exceptional talent all over the world and she credits the team around her for MERC’s success. When interviewing prospective candidates, what does she look for? “First impressions count,” she says, “but what is important is the energy level, how they communicate, whether they have a can do, will do attitude, so resilience is important and the ability to inspire others.” A busy mother of four children aged from 3-10, she is married to fellow Galwegian Darren Cunningham, founder of a biotech company pioneering new ways of treating cancer. DMcQ Media Anne-Marie Tomchak UK Editor, Mashable You might not have heard the name Anne-Marie Tomchak, but take note of it – she is one of the people shaping the international digital media landscape in her new role heading up Mashable’s operations in the UK. “When I was growing up, we didn’t even have a phone, so it’s quite funny that I’ve found myself in this position,” she says. Now 34, the Longford native got her start at RTÉ, where she worked on Morning Ireland, before joining the BBC. She worked her way up the ranks, creating and presenting BBC Trending, and ultimately finding herself at the forefront of its digital media offering. By 2016, she found herself looking a for a new challenge, that would allow her to take on a more strategic role in an organisation. The job at Mashable gave her that opportunity, and she is now at the helm of a digital operation that employs 20. Irish people “do very well in social media and digital media internationally”, she says. “I don’t know if it’s just that we’re such good storytellers, or that Ireland hasn’t traditionally had such a hierarchical culture, but we’re very good at putting others at ease.” Tomchak says she has been helped by both male and female mentors, but she believes women in particular can help to pave the way for one another. “Now I’m lucky enough to be in a position where I’m hiring and managing people, I’m very conscious that women sometimes face different challenges than male colleagues. Overall, I think it’s an amazing time to be a woman in the media. Sure the internet has brought some negatives, but the positives of the digital world far outweigh them.” As an identical twin, Tomchak has a broad notion of what constitutes success, and believes career advancement is not the only yardstick. “Everyone is on their own journey and the quickest route to dissatisfaction is comparing yourself to others in a negative way. My twin sister is a mother of three small children, so we’re leading very different lives, and that gives me an interesting perspective. JO’C Dee Forbes Director General, RTÉ If there was some surprise surrounding Dee Forbes’s appointment to the top job at RTÉ last summer, it wasn’t about whether the former head of Discovery Networks in Northern Europe was up to the task. After all, her previous role involved managing 27 TV brands in 18 markets, reaching more than 270 million households. Instead, it was because some found it hard to believe that an RTÉ outsider would want the role of director general in an era likely to prove the national broadcaster’s most challenging yet, as it struggles to figure out how to adapt and survive in the digital era. ADVERTISEMENT But Forbes is not only undaunted by the prospect of turning RTÉ around, she seems to positively relish it. “Change can be disconcerting, but ultimately I have always believed that change is good,” she wrote in an early email to staff. She has already said she believes the RTÉ five years from now will be a very different beast to the one we have today. Top of her agenda from a content perspective is the mix of programme genres on schedules, the marketing of channels and services, how it fulfils its public service remit, the need to reach younger viewers and to work with what she playfully calls RTÉ’s “frenemies”. However she chooses to navigate those issues over the next five years, it’s safe to say the only thing with a permanent place on the schedule at RTÉ is change. JO’C Maeve Higgins Comedian, broadcaster It was always unlikely that Higgins’ talent would be confined to a small island. Having excelled on Naked Camera and Maeve Higgins’ Fancy Vittles, a broader audience called. She moved to London, then to New York, where she teamed up with Jon Ronson for a monthly show in Brooklyn. An excellent radio documentary-maker, Higgins has brought this prowess to her latest venture, an insightful and funny podcast about immigration, Maeve In America, where she again excels at storytelling. She has written for the New York Times, Elle, had a much-loved column in The Irish Times, appeared on Inside Amy Schumer, co-hosts Neil deGrasse Tyson’s StarTalk, and has written two excellent memoirs; We Have A Good Time… Don’t We? and Off We Go. Her writing and columnising casts surreal nets on a tide of sometimes pleasantly meandering and sometimes biting one-liners, with a style lying somewhere between David Sedaris and Phoebe Robinson, but still very much all Higgins. Her creative voice is so her’s that it’s impossible not to hear it when you read her work, and in a live standup context, her disarming self-deprecating style has a habit of snapping into focus revealing a piercing intelligence underneath. UM Health and science Johanne Powell holding Siobhan Powell Johanne Powell Carer Influence isn’t only about career accolades or chunky pay packets. Johanne Powell’s contribution to Irish society was to force us to revisit how we think and talk about those who do the important, undervalued, and still predominantly female, work of caring. In an interview with Irish Times journalist Rosita Boland in November 2016, she spoke with searing, and often uncomfortable honesty, about the struggle she faces to care for her profoundly disabled 32-year-old daughter Siobhan. “I’m not doing this job by choice,” she said. “I’m doing this job because I have to do it, because there is no alternative. I don’t want to do it anymore. I’m bored. I’m bored out of my tree doing the same thing day in, day out, with no changes.” Siobhan had by then spent three years on a waiting list of 61 people for a residential care place in their native Co Wexford. Powell’s interview lifted the lid on the unrecognised acts of heroism and endurance being carried out on an hourly basis across the State, and resonated with many other carers who are also in crisis. She demanded that we stop seeing them as saints “who’ll get their reward in heaven” and start seeing them for what they really are: overworked and underpaid humans, who desperately deserve a break. JO’C Dr Nora Khaldi Founder and Chief Scientific Officer, Nuritas At a time when the paucity of women in science is a real and pressing issue for the industry, it is hard to think of a better role model for aspiring young female scientists – or women in general, or humans in general, for that matter – than Dr Nora Khaldi. ADVERTISEMENT Born in Algeria to an Irish mother and a French father, Khaldi is a mathematician with a PhD in molecular evolution and bioinformatics from Trinity College Dublin. Shewas the first scientist to show gene transfer between multi-cellular species. Impressive though that sounds, it’s not actually what she’s best known for. In 2014, she set up Nuritas to develop the future of food – healthy living through functional, scientifically proven, and readily available ingredients, including things as ordinary as milk. That is every bit as revolutionary as it sounds: the company is currently trying to help people at risk of developing Type 2 diabetes fight it through the use of peptides, or molecules, that can be added to food. “Food is not the problem; food is the solution. And we should look at food as the solution,” she says. Last year, Khaldi’s start-up won a €3 million research grant from the EU and raised €2 million in funding from major investors including Salesforce founder Marc Benioff; Ali Partovi, who was an early investor in both Dropbox and Facebook; Bono and The Edge. Oh, and Nuritas was named one of Europe’s top 10 most innovative start-up companies by the European Commission. So what did you get up to in 2016 again? JO’C Food Tara McCarthy Bord Bia CEO Unlike many high achieving business women who operate in male-dominated environments, Tara McCarthy, who is chief executive of Board Bia, leads an organisation where women are strongly represented in the higher echelons of the command chain and throughout the company. “Traditionally the food and farming sector has been male dominated; however within Bord Bia almost 65 per cent of staff are female,” she says. McCarthy joined Bord Bia’s graduate programme having completed her primary degree in commerce at UCG and a Masters at the Smurfit Business School. In her 20-year career at the Irish food board she worked in France and Germany for more than 10 years, and fulfilled a number of senior management roles, rising to director of the food and beverages division. In September 2015, she took up the position of chief executive of Board Iascaigh Mhara. But with the imminent retirement of former Bord Bia chef executive Aidan Cotter, just 18 months later she was back in Lr Mount Street, at the helm of an organisation facing challenging markets and global uncertainty. “Brexit is a major concern and has certainly changed the landscape and how we will operate hereon. It has also made the industry, and all of us working on its behalf, more focussed and determined than ever. “Under Food Wise 2025, the industry-led strategic plan, we have an ambitious export target of reaching €19 billion by 2025, compared to €11 billion last year. This, and delivering on Bord Bia’s strategic plan, is my priority right now and will continue to be for the years ahead,” she says. McCarthy has been a regular contributor to the Government’s Food Harvest 2020 and Food Wise 2025 reports and is involved in the Pathways for Growth programme. “I always did like a challenge,” she says.       Topics: Ali Partovi Anne Anderson Anne Jo C Anne Marie Tomchak Uk Annie Mac Annie Mac Presents Aosdana Barack Obama Bernard O Byrne Breege O Donoghue Caitlin Moran Ciara Donlon Cocoa Brown Dennis Kelly Enda Kenny Taoiseach Graham Linehan Helen Linehan Holly Walsh Joanne O Riordan Johanne Powell John O Regan John Peel Julie Sinnamon Louise O Neill Cork Mac Um Annie Marc Benioff Marian Keyes Marissa Carter Marissa Carter Joc Minerva Mertens Minnie Melange Miss Ireland Nora Khaldi Founder Nuritas Pat Hickey Penney Sonly Richard Rogers Rob Delaney Rosita Boland Ryan Dcu Sarah Keane Sharon Horgan Shelley Mcnamara Farrell Sinead Kane Stefanie Preissner Um Sarah Keane Um Sharon Horgan Um Sinead Burke Um Sinead Kane Willie O Brien Yvonne Farrell Zane Lowe Academy Female High Fliers Accelerator American Library Association Crafts Council of Ireland Dcu Ryan Academy Department Of Foreign Affairs Enterprise Ireland Eu European Commission European Union Fordham University IDA Ireland Medical School Olympic Council Of Ireland Paul Marshall Institute RTÉ SNAP School Of Acting School Of Economics Trinity College Dublin Un United Nations Universita Luigi Bocconi University College Cork University Toulouse 1 University of Limerick Utec University Wexford Bank of Ireland Cartier Dropbox Facebook Grafton HBO Junior Chamber International Khaldi Merman NHS Riba Salesforce Theya Theya Healthcare Vhi Writer Algeria An Uaimh Australia Bucureşti Clonmel County Longford Dublin(IE) Edinburgh Europe Finland France Glastonbury Ireland Japan Las Vegas Lima(PE) London(GB) Malta Milano Millstreet New York City Paris(FR) United Kingdom United States Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Beauty Serums: the fruit and veg of skincare Food & Drink Ticket to cook: Irish chefs head for NYC, London, the Maldives Motors Revealed: how newest cars fared in toughest winter test around Film ‘I’m trying to make these huge questions more tangible and more personal’ Sponsored First-time buyers put Bray, Finglas and Navan on the map Vhi SwiftCare Clinics: when it’s not an emergency but it feels like one Tallaght leads in neighbourhood ranking for first-time buyer sales Putting business owners in control – the Convertibill way ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Commenting on The Irish Times has changed.

By Roger Wohlner | March 4, 2017 Previously 21 Ways the Rich Waste Their Money 1/16 Show Thumbnails Krista Kennell / Shutterstock.com Warren Buffett — perhaps the greatest investor of his or any other generation — is known for buying stocks and holding them for long periods of time through his firm, Berkshire Hathaway. Yet, it was recently announced that he has sold nearly all of his shares of Walmart. And last year, he exited his investment in AT&T. It was also recently announced that Buffett increased his shares of Apple and invested heavily in several airline stocks, including a new investment in Southwest Airlines. Previously, he largely shunned the airline industry. Here's a look at some stocks where Buffett has increased his investment in recent years, as well as a recap of some of the larger Berkshire Hathaway holdings. Looking over the list might help you decide where to invest in stocks during 2017. 2/16 Show Thumbnails pio3 / Shutterstock.com 1. Apple Berkshire Hathaway added to its Apple stake significantly in 2016. In the fourth quarter alone, it nearly quadrupled its shares of Apple. Apple continues to grow, and its products remain popular. The stock price is near its all-time high, buoyed in part by the company buying back shares of the stock, and by a steady dividend. Many mutual funds hold Apple stock. The company is setting records for unit sales of the iPhone. Although Apple continues as a leader in the tech space, a caution surrounds the continued pace of price appreciation, with the stock up more than 18 percent so far in 2017. 3/16 Show Thumbnails Lerner Vadim / Shutterstock.com 2. Delta Air Lines In mid-February, Berkshire Hathaway reported that it had amassed more shares of Delta Air Lines as part of a move to increase holdings in the airline industry. Berkshire Hathaway's investment in Delta was worth about $3 billion at the end of 2016. Delta had reported average annual earnings growth of more than 21 percent for the previous five years and a dividend yield of 1.47 percent, according to Morningstar. 4/16 Show Thumbnails Philip Pilosian / Shutterstock.com 3. United Continental Holdings Berkshire Hathaway reported holdings of about $2.1 billion of United Continental stock at the end of 2016. One of Buffett's best performing stocks of 2016, United Continental had reported average annual earnings growth of 13 percent for the previous five years. Over the past 12 months, the stock has traded in the range of $37.41 to $76.80 per share, with a recent close of $75.41. 5/16 Show Thumbnails Philip Pilosian / Shutterstock.com 4. American Airlines Berkshire Hathaway reported holdings of about $2.1 billion of American Airlines stock at the end of 2016. Like other carriers, American Airlines is constantly trying to innovate to gain an edge in a competitive industry. Recently, it unveiled Basic Economy fares in a handful of markets. 6/16 Show Thumbnails Chris Parypa Photography / Shutterstock.com 5. Southwest Airlines As part of an increase in airline holdings, Berkshire Hathaway reported a fourth-quarter 2016 purchase of $2 billion of stock in Southwest, a new position for Buffett. The stock posted a total return of 42.44 percent over the 12 months ending Feb. 24. That beat the Standard & Poor's 500 index (25.36 percent) and the average stock in Morningstar's airline group (24.53 percent). 7/16 Show Thumbnails Peter Braakmann / Shutterstock.com 6. Monsanto Berkshire Hathaway reported the purchase of about 8 million shares — worth more than $800 million — of Monsanto, a sustainable agriculture company. The stock posted a total return of 29.98 percent over the 12 months ending Feb. 24, beating the S&P 500 index (25.36 percent). 8/16 Show Thumbnails zhu difeng / Shutterstock.com 7. Sirius XM Berkshire Hathaway reported a $790 million purchase of shares of Sirius XM, a new position for Buffett in 2016. The stock posted a total return of 42.78 percent over the 12 months ending Feb. 24, beating the S&P 500 index (25.36 percent) but slightly below the average stock in Morningstar's broadcasting-radio group (41.34 percent). The company has a history of exceeding its earnings guidance. 9/16 Show Thumbnails JuliusKielaitis / Shutterstock.com 8. International Business Machines IBM is one of the largest investments in the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio, worth almost $15 billion as of the end of 2016. The stock posted a total return of 40.78 percent over the 12 months ending Feb. 24, beating the S&P 500 index (25.36 percent) and above the average stock in Morningstar's information technology services group (27.58 percent). In fact, IBM might be a great stock for you to consider purchasing — especially if you're new to investing. 10/16 Show Thumbnails Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com 9. Phillips 66 Berkshire's stake in Phillips 66 was about $6.3 billion as of the end of 2016. The stock posted a total return of 1.85 percent over the 12 months ending Feb. 24, trailing the S&P 500 index (25.36 percent) and below the average stock in Morningstar's information oil and gas refining and marketing group (14.38 percent). Before you invest in Phillips 66, make sure you learn how to invest in oil stocks. 11/16 Show Thumbnails Sibuet Benjamin / Shutterstock.com 10. Kraft Heinz Kraft Heinz is Berkshire Hathaway's largest holding, worth nearly $30 billion as of the end of 2016. The stock posted a total return of 30.74 percent over the 12 months ending Feb. 24, trailing the S&P 500 index (25.36 percent) and above the average stock in Morningstar's information packaged goods group (16.76 percent). 12/16 Show Thumbnails Atstock Productions / Shutterstock.com 11. MasterCard Berkshire Hathaway's stake in MasterCard was more than $545 million at the end of 2016. The stock posted a total return of 29.36 percent over the 12 months ending Feb. 24, beating the S&P 500 index (25.36 percent) but trailing the average stock in Morningstar's credit services group (30.33 percent). Morningstar analysts feel the company has solidified its competitive position. They cite the company's network of global banks, merchants and cardholders as huge advantages. 13/16 Show Thumbnails Faiz Zaki / Shutterstock.com 12. Coca-Cola Berkshire Hathaway's stake in Coca-Cola was more than $16.7 billion at the end of 2016. The stock posted a total loss of 1.66 percent over the 12 months ending Feb. 24, trailing the S&P 500 index (25.36 percent) and the average stock in Morningstar's beverages-soft drinks group (3.22 percent). Morningstar analysts are optimistic about the company, citing its position as the leader in its segment as a factor in its ability to maintain a premium price. Morningstar also likes the opportunities for growth in emerging-market countries. 14/16 Show Thumbnails Peppinuzzo / Shutterstock.com 13. Wells Fargo Wells Fargo is a longtime Berkshire Hathaway holding that Buffett added to in 2015. Even in the wake of the fake account opening scandal last year, he has not liquidated any shares. Even with the scandal and its fallout, the stock's total return over the 12 months ending Feb. 24 was 24.62 percent, only slightly below that of the S&P 500 index at 25.36 percent. The total return was about half that of the average stock in Morningstar's bank group, however. According to the latest Morningstar analysis, "Wells Fargo's January business update confirmed our thesis that the impact of widespread sales fraud will be relatively short lived. Consumer checking account openings exceeded closings, deposit balances grew at a healthy rate during the ear, and reported customer satisfaction metrics are closing in on pre-scandal levels." 15/16 Show Thumbnails Andrey Arkusha / Shutterstock.com 14. Bank of New York Mellon Berkshire Hathaway's position in Bank of New York Mellon was worth just over $1 billion at the end of 2016. The stock posted a total return of 37.56 percent over the 12 months ending Feb. 24, beating the S&P 500 index (25.36 percent) and the average stock in Morningstar's asset management group (34.25 percent). Morningstar cites the "stickiness" of the firm's asset custody business and the leverage inherent in the firm's operations as reasons for optimism about the stock in the coming months. 16/16 Show Thumbnails iStock.com / Linda Parton 15. General Motors Berkshire Hathaway's stake in General Motors was worth around $1.8 billion at the end of 2016. The stock posted a total return of 33.22 percent over the 12 months ending Feb. 24, beating the S&P 500 index (25.36 percent) and the average stock in Morningstar's auto manufacturers group (20.96 percent). Morningstar analysts feel General Motors has tremendous earnings potential now that it can focus its U.S. marketing efforts on just four car brands instead of eight.

Assembly Elections 2017: Is Modi on a road to nowhere in Uttar Pradesh? NEW DELHI: Apple recorded the fastest growth in the Indian tablet market in the quarter ended December 2016 and made it into the top five, even as the segment shrank 3.1% to 3.7 million units for the year. The declining trend, which has been consistent over the past few years, is expected to continue, analysts at two research firms said. Apple’s shipments in the December quarter grew 16% from the preceding one and 17% from the year earlier, said analysts at International Data Corporation (IDC) India, adding that the Cupertino-based company had moved up the rankings after a long time. “While iPad Air 2 remained the topselling model for Apple, constituting half its total shipments, the iPad Pro accounted for 22.7% of India’s total detachable category in 2016,” IDC said Thursday. Detachables, which come with keyboards that can removed, are a subset of the tablet market. For the quarter and year ended December, the top four tablet makers by volume were Datawind, Samsung, Lenovo and iBall, in that order. Micromax was fifth for the full year and Apple took the slot in the fourth quarter. Cybermedia Research (CMR) reported a sharper 18% on-year fall in tablet shipments in 2016, to 3.5 million units, with Datawind leading the market, followed by Samsung, Pantel and Micromax. IDC analysts said consumer demand for tablets will decline in the coming years thanks to smartphones with large screens, reflecting a global trend as buyers hold on to their old devices instead of buying new ones. Commercial shipments may partially offset this with adoption having increased recently. The segment grew 35% in the full year. “We expect this to grow further in coming quarters,” said IDC India senior analyst Karthik J. “Detachables are expected to continue with healthy double-digit growth in 2016.” CMR expects data bundling and a strategic focus on industries such as healthcare or cab aggregators to provide some growth. But consolidation is set to hit this segment as well, the firm said, predicting that only six to seven players may remain, having dropped to 22 from 66 in 2015. Fourth-quarter tablet shipments fell 19.6% from the preceding one and 4.3% from the year earlier to 820,000 units. “This is primarily due to seasonal decline after festive spike in Q3 and demonetization limiting the consumer sales in the last quarter of the year,” IDC said. IDC said the detachables category grew 30.7% in 2016, driven by demand from both the consumer and commercial segments. Acer accounted for almost a fourth of them, followed by Apple’s iPad Pro. 4G tablets accounted for almost 25% of total tablet shipments in 2016, up from 6% in the previous year, both research agencies said.

Launched in 2008, Spotify had 40 million paid subscribers in September and the company tweeted the 50 million figure on Thursday, the same day messaging app company Snap Inc pulled off its massive share sale that bodes well for other technology companies considering a flotation. Apple, which launched its music service less than two years ago, had about 20 million subscribers in December and its entry looks to have done little to slow the rapid growth of its older Swedish-based rival. Spotify, which has yet to show a profit as it spends to grow internationally, is now looking at a possible stock market listing in the United States, online news portal TechCrunch said last month. A company spokeswoman declined to comment on Friday on when it might seek a listing. But a partner at a leading investor in Spotify, venture capital firm Northzone, said late last year the company could start to become profitable as early as 2017 after years of focusing squarely on “growth, growth, growth”. Spotify is the most highly valued venture backed start-up in Europe and according to media reports is considering a listing on Nasdaq and potentially a dual listing on the Nasdaq exchange in Stockholm, where the company is headquartered. It was last valued at $8.53 billion, according to venture capital market research firm CB Insights. That valuation alone would make a flotation Europe’s biggest technology start-up listing since the market launch of German e-commerce investor Rocket Internet in 2014. While still loss-making, Spotify has posted rapid subscriber growth since it was created a decade ago by Swedish founders Daniel Ek and Martin Lorentzon. Following its announcement on Thursday that it had reached 50 million paid subscribers, Ek made a point of retweeting a comment from Wall Street media analyst Rick Greenfield which pointed to how Spotify was adding subscribers at an increasingly rapid rate. The Stockholm-based company also announced a major expansion in New York last month. One of Europe’s most highly valued venture-backed start-ups, Spotify will move its New York office to the World Trade Center from the Midtown area of Manhattan, adding more than 1,000 new jobs. In 2016 Americans used on-demand streaming platforms, such as Spotify, to listen to 431 billion music tracks, Nielsen said in its U.S. year-end report.

Apple Launches a Gold 32GB iPhone 6 Variant for Asian Markets GO It’s a limited-edition model offered by Taiwan Mobile Mar 4, 2017 08:35 GMT  ·  By Alexandra Vaidos  ·  Share:  Apple has quietly introduced a variant of its iPhone 6 model, one that offers 32GB of internal memory and comes in a Gold color. Apple launched the iPhone 6 back in 2014 in three storage variants 6GB, 64GB, and 128GB. The new iPhone 6 with 32GB is offered by Taiwan Mobile for a 30-month contract for about $45 per month. The model has already been made available in China, sold by third-party retailers, and it will arrive at Taiwan Mobile on March 10. Taiwan Mobile says that the model is a limited edition, which means that only a few units will be offered, until the stock runs out. The model is also available from Apple’s website. 4.7-inch display and 1GB of RAM iPhone 6 comes with a 4.7-inch display with 750 x 1334 pixel resolution. It has 1GB of RAM and draws power from a 1,810mAh battery. The smartphone features a dual-core Apple A8 chipset, clocked at 1.4GHz and PowerVR GX6450 graphics processing unit. iPhone 6 with 32GB of storage in gold The phone’s rear camera capacity reaches 8MP with f/2.2 aperture and dual-LED flash, while its front camera is 1.2MP with the same aperture and FaceTime over Wi-Fi or cellular feature. The iPhone 6 is currently offered in Space Gray, Silver and Gold colors. Apple is also rumored to announce a new iPhone SE with 128GB of storage this month, during the unveiling of new iPad Pro devices. iPhone SE currently sells in variants with 16GB and 64GB of memory, while a model with more onboard memory would certainly appeal to customers who are fans of iPhones with smaller screens. A 32GB iPhone SE variant would also be released, but that remains to be seen. Analysts have said that Apple won’t announce a refresh of the iPhone SE this year, as the company is focusing on the iPhone 8 to mark the ten-year anniversary since the first iPhone was launched.   CHECK OUT THE GALLERY  (2 Images) #Apple#iPhone 6#iPhone SE#iPhone 8#iPad Pro subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Apple iPhone 6 (2 Images) 01 02 Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Apple iPhone 8 to Feature a Redesigned Fingerprint Sensor Apple's 2017 iPhones to Feature Lightning Ports, Not USB Type-C Apple Might Announce New iPhone SE with 128GB This Month Apple Files Patent for Scroll-like iPhone with Retractable Display Third-Party Windows Updates Kind of Risky, Security Expert Says Google May Ditch 3.5mm Headphone Jacks on Next Pixel Phones AMD Rolls Out Its New Crimson ReLive Graphics Driver - Get Version 17.3.1 Google Play Celebrates Five Years, Here Are the Most Downloaded Games and Apps Samsung Confirms Delay of Android Nougat Update to Galaxy S6 and S6 edge Third-Party Windows Updates Kind of Risky, Security Expert Says Google May Ditch 3.5mm Headphone Jacks on Next Pixel Phones AMD Rolls Out Its New Crimson ReLive Graphics Driver - Get Version 17.3.1 2 photos    Apple iPhone 6 new ios apps NeuroNation: Train your brain to improve your memory and focus with NeuroNation Flipagram: Create cool videos by mixing up your photos with music Timer+: Set up dozens of timers and control them all with ease Nutshell Camera: Create some pretty cool videos with Nutshell Camera IKEA Catalogue: Check out the IKEA Catalogue for more than just furniture Complete: Complete puts a social twist to your regular to-do list/ task manager WebMD Baby: WebMD Baby offers help in how to best tend to your baby Reader comments New Noncombustible Battery with Three Times More Power Is Under Development more on: Battery i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

The videos follow the same format as the ones launched a few weeks ago. Each video starts of as a Tweet that highlights some issues non-iPad Pro users deal with regularly. The first video shows a female student having a problem in keeping her math notes tidy since she always falls asleep during the lecture. It then proceeds to showcase the iPad Pro’s note taking capabilities through the Apple Pencil. It even highlights the device’s capability of recording full lectures. Meanwhile, the second video shows a woman complaining about having so many things on her desk. It then rolls to suggest the iPad Pro as a replacement for a desktop and other usual accessories such as a scanner and a piece of paper. Just as it has done in the previous series of videos, the tweets featured are real and come from actual people. Apple has used these common problem as a way to address the issues people have with their devices. So far, the other videos feature the iPad Pro’s speed, Microsoft Word app, LTE connectivity, the Apple Pencil, and many more. The videos come as part of Apple’s promotion for the rumored release of the new iPad Pro. According to rumors, Apple will be refreshing the device with a 10.5-inch flagship model and three other tablets with a 9.7-inch, 12.9-inch, and a 7.9-inch display. The device is believed to launch this month.

Friday’s complaint concerns three apartment buildings – located at 201 5th Ave. N., 621 5th Ave. S., and 401 Pine Street in Edmonds – that are managed by defendant Debbie A. Appleby, of Stanwood, Wash. The properties are owned by three Limited Liability Corporations controlled by Appleby – Apple One, LLC, Apple Two, LLC, and Apple Three, LLC—which are also named as defendants in the suit. The complaint alleges that in March 2014, defendant Appleby told a woman seeking an apartment for herself, her husband and their 1-year-old child that the apartment buildings were “adult only” and therefore not available to her family. The complaint also alleges that at various other times from April 2014 to November 2015, defendants advertised their available apartments as being restricted to adults only. The family filed a complaint with the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which conducted an investigation, issued a charge of discrimination against the defendants, and referred the case to the Department of Justice. “Equal access to housing is essential for all Americans, including families with young children,” said U.S. Attorney Annette L. Hayes. “Particularly in our tight housing market, landlords must follow the law and make units available without discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, disability or familial status.” “The Fair Housing Act prohibits landlords from denying apartments to families just because they have children,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Tom Wheeler of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division. “Many families already face challenges finding affordable housing, and they should not also have to deal with unlawful discrimination.” The complaint seeks a court order requiring defendants to cease their discriminatory housing practices, damages for the family that filed the HUD complaint and any other families against whom the defendants discriminated against because they had children, plus civil penalties. Any individuals who have information relevant to this case are encouraged to contact the Civil Rights Division at 1-800-896-7743, Option 96.The case is being jointly handled by trial attorney Kathryn Legomsky for the Civil Rights Division for the U.S. Department of Justice and Assistant United States Attorney J. Michael Diaz for the Western District of Washington. You can read the full Justice Department complaint here.

We couldn’t figure it out because she was one of the first people to view and she and her husband had great jobs. Now she knows. Reply Laura Johnson March 4, 2017 at 2:14 pm Joy- That is disappointing, but Edmonds is not immune and discrimination eventually touches all of us. We need to take a stand against discrimination and profiling- in their many unjust forms. Reply Alec denson March 4, 2017 at 9:30 pm “not immune to discrimination” – pretty euphemistic way of putting it. Edmonds is one of the whitest places in western Washington.

But those concerns were quickly erased when I discovered MacSuperstore, an authorized Apple reseller that had been in business since the 90’s. The store offered everything that a corporate Apple Store had to offer, and more, as it wasn’t constrained by the limitations Apple puts on its own stores. MacSuperstore could deal in used products, as well as items from third-party vendors that Apple would never stock in its own stores. Being the only authorized Apple reseller in the area, MacSuperstore saw steady success. And apparently, the independent store’s good fortunes put MacSuperstore’s locale on Apple’s radar. In 2007, Apple opened the Higuera Street Apple Store in downtown San Luis Obispo. I wrote a (now long-gone) blog post at the time criticizing this decision, as it felt like Apple was moving in on MacSuperstore’s turf and pushing out an established business that you’d think Apple would see as a valued partner instead of a competitor. The years carried on and MacSuperstore seemed to weather the Apple Store’s encroachment. MacSuperstore even moved into a bigger, fancier location, right next to the new Target store on the west side of town. But the local market is apparently not big enough for two Apple dealers. Last December, seemingly out of nowhere, MacSuperstore sent this e-mail to customers: Dear Customers & Friends, It was August 1998….. the iMac was a week old and MacSuperstore came to life. A little store with big dreams (who else would put “superstore” on a 1,200 sq/ft store)? Over the years, we’ve dedicated ourselves to providing the best possible customer care along side the world’s best tech products; unfortunately, the industry and the way folks shop has changed a lot, and our efforts to represent Apple have come at a cost. These days, with box stores and online sources heavily discounting the same products, Apple needs the “little guys” less and less. After much consideration, we have decided to close our doors. In the end, no matter how happy our customers are or great the store looks, a business has to be profitable to survive. We appreciate the dedication of our customers in giving us a chance to serve you. Seeing the positive impact of technology in the lives of our customers, has been what kept us going these 18 years. It has been a good run, but a necessary ending. Thanks for everything… Shane (The e-mail was signed by Shane Williams, founder of MacSuperstore.) I was shocked to get that e-mail, as I thought the store was doing fine. I was also concerned about some trade-in credit I had remaining with the store. But MacSuperstore stayed a class act ’til the end, giving me cash on the spot for the trade-in credit, no questions asked. It’s impossible to say just how much Apple’s influence in the local market affected MacSuperstore’s bottom line. Brick-and-mortar shops are being assaulted from all directions these days, and it’s likely MacSuperstore lost some customers to online sellers. Still, during a conversation I had with a knowledgable MacSuperstore employee on one of the store’s final days, he said that Apple has pretty much stopped licensing independent stores as authorized resellers. He also said that, due to Apple’s own requirements, MacSuperstore couldn’t sell their Apple license to a new buyer. MacSuperstore had bought out several other Apple retailers in nearby markets over the years. All of those stores have since closed, along with the San Luis Obispo shop. I’ll definitely miss having this unique store in my hometown. Of course, the Higuuera Street Apple Store is likely to be there for years to come. But, that corporate store will never have the heart and soul of that independent reseller on the other side of town. RIP, MacSuperstore.

Camera is one of the important factors of a smartphone as it is essential for capturing those memorable moments, and a lot of us today are dependent on our mobile phones for the same. Once, people used to purchase digital camerad to capture different momories and it was a must carry device when going out for a vacation. But, things have changed now. Smartphones with good camera performance  have taken their place.   Listed here are 5 smartphones that will never let you down when it comes to capturing pictures offering quality imaging. Our list also includes the smartphones which come with dual rear camera setup. These devices feature a combination of either two differnt or same megapixel dual camera sensors. The secondary camera at the back of the device is to provide enhanced depth of field (DOF) or BOKEH effect. DOF, also called focus range or effective focus range is the distance between the nearest and farthest objects in a scene that appears acceptably sharp in an image. Read on to find out more. Apple iPhone 7 Plus The Apple iphone 7 Plus was launched in India last year in October in 32 GB, 128 GB and 256 GB storage models. Apple iPhone 7 Plus comes with a 5.5 inch LED backlit IPS display with 1920x1080 pixel resolution having 625 cd/M2 max brightness. It comes with dual camera set up having a primary 12 megapixel camera and a secondary 12 megapixel camera as well. The secondary camera in the iPhone 7 Plus is meant to create depth effect in images and helps users to get 2x zoom without any assistance from software. Post 2x, the camera takes help of software as is usually happens in smartphones.   The primary 12 megapixel camera in iPhone 7 Plus has f/1.8 aperture, Optical Image Stabilisation, six element lens, Live Photo feature with stabilization, Sapphire crystal lens cover, Backside illumination sensor, Hybrid IR filter, Auto HDR, Burst mode, timer mode, panorama and geo tagging features. There is Quad LED True tone flash light in the back panel of the phone. The 12 megapixel camera can record 4K videos, slow motion full HD videos at 120 fps and HD videos at 240 fps. The iPhone 7 Plus has 7 megapixel front camera with f/2.2 aperture. Called as FaceTime HD camera, these can record full HD videos, and have BSI sensor, Auto HDR, Auto Image Stabilisation, Burst mode and Timer mode. Apple introduced its new CPU – A10Fusion, which it said is the best ever CPU to feature in a smartphone. Built on the 64-bit architecture, the CPU comes with four cores – two for conserving battery power and two for high performance. They have a separate motion coprocessor while Apple says that their graphics processor is 50 per cent faster than that of previous A9 SoC. The LTE enabled iPhone 7 Plus has WiFi (ac), WiFi with MIMO, Bluetooth 4.2, GPS with GLONASS and NFC. It has fingerprint sensor that is integrated into the home button. The built in Li-Ion battery claims to offer talktime of upto 21 hours on 3G network. Besides, the smartphone come with nano SIM slot, Three-axis gyro, Accelerometer, Proximity sensor, Ambient light sensor and Barometer sensors. Honor 6X Earlier, this year Huawei launched the Honor 6X smartphone with dual-camera set up for Rs 12,999 for the 3GB RAM variant and Rs 15,999 for 4GB RAM variant. The device comes in two variants, a 3GB RAM + 32GB internal storage and a 4GB RAM + 64GB variants and is available exclusively via Amazon India. The main highlight of the device is the dual-camera setup at the back. Honor 6X comes with a dual-camera set up at the back with one sensor being a 12-megapixel sensor and other being a 2-megapixel sensor. The set up comes with phase detection autofocus (PDAF), LED flash etc. At the front, there is an 8-megapxel sensor for selfies. The set up lets you dig into and play with shallow depth of field and one can change the focus of an image post clicking it. The secondary camera at the back of the device is to provide enhanced depth of field or bokeh effect. However, you have to be very careful at times to get that perfect shot. If done right, the shot comes out to be really natural and the software also allows you to select the focal point after you have clicked the image. The camera is though impressive in low-light, but the camera manages to dig out pretty good selfies in daylight. See Huawei Honor 6X Camera Samples As far as other specifications are concerned, Honor 6X runs on Android 6.0 Marshmallow with EMUI v4.1 on top. Other than that, it comes with a 5.5-inch (1080x1920 pixels) full-HD IPS display with 2.5D curved glass protection. On the inside, the device is powered by a Kirin 655 octa-core (4 cores at 2.1GHz + 4 cores at 1.7GHz) chipset with Mali-T830MP2 GPU paired with 3GB RAM + 32GB internal storage or 4GB RAM + 64GB internal storage. In both the cases, the internal storage is expandable via microSD card. There is 3340 mAh battery inside and the smartphone also offers 4G with VoLTE, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS with A-GPS, Compass etc. You can read its review here: Huawei Honor 6X Review: More than just a swagphone 1 2 >> Top 5 Camera Smartphones Best 5 Camera Smartphones iphone 7 plus honor 6x Huawei P9 Google Pixel LG V20 Camera Smartphones First Published : Saturday, March 04, 2017 - 11:22 Similar News Epson L655 printer Review: An all in one printer that will not disappoint!

By Mikah Sargent Friday, Mar 3, 2017 at 8:30 am EST 0 Comments Apple's new HomeKit mini site is the perfect place to learn about new HomeKit-enabled accessories. I've been waiting for Apple create its latest mini site since I first heard the word "HomeKit" way back in 2014. The site, lovingly nestled within the iOS section of Apple's site features a fun film that shows off some of the cool stuff you can do with HomeKit-enabled accessories, Siri, and the iOS Home app. Personally, I think the gal in the video has way too many HomeKit scenes, but that's neither here nor there. If you're curious, you can check out the page at the following link. If you wanna know what you're getting yourself into first, read on! Apple's HomeKit mini site So what's this mini site all about? It's all about HomeKit, the Home app, and HomeKit-enabled accessories. This site is dedicated to not only explaining what the heck that little orange, house-shaped tile on your iPhone is for, it's dedicated to explaining the benefits and possibilities of home automation with HomeKit and the Home app. You can get a brief overview of the Home app, learn about HomeKit scenes, Siri voice control, HomeKit automations, HomeKit-enabled accessories, and home hubs. Can't I get that right here on iMore? HOW FUNNY! I was hoping you were going to ask that! Yes, yes you can. HomeKit HomeKit FAQ HomeKit accessories HomeKit help HomeKit explainer HomeKit news HomeKit discussion I'm gonna let you in on a little secret, though: You should still check out Apple's site, 'cause it'll be one of the places I regularly check when I'm writing about HomeKit news. Does the site help me set up HomeKit accessories? Yup! It can be a little tricky setting up HomeKit-enabled accessories (mostly because they typically require third-party app set up before HomeKit set up), so Apple's linked to a support article with loads of information about setting up your various gadgets in the Home app. What else does the site feature? Uh, only a dream come true (for me, anyway)! There's now a page that shows all the HomeKit-enabled accessories approved by Apple. The page is beautifully designed and split into accessory type, so you can tap (or click) to jump to a specific section. The list has links to the various accessories (YESSSS!) and offers up information about their availability. The availability tags include Announced and Coming Soon. It's not entirely clear what they mean, but we can use context clues to decipher: Announced: Either the product has been announced for the first time or HomeKit compatibility has been announced. I get the impression this means it'll be awhile before we see the product available for purchase. Coming soon: I take it this is a step above "Announced". The product (or HomeKit compatibility) is right around the corner. I wish I knew the exact timeframe, 'cause there are a few accessories on the list I'm eyeballing. Anything else? Nope, that's pretty much it! But it's a whole heck of a lot, to be honest. Apple's list of HomeKit-enabled accessories used to be buried in its vast Apple Support database. The page was a long, bulleted list (without links!) of available HomeKit-enabled accessories — upcoming accessories weren't listed. It also wasn't updated as often as HomeKit-enabled gadgetry was hitting the market. This dedicated mini site coupled with Tim Cook describing his personal HomeKit setup in the last Apple earnings call gives me hope and loads of excitement for the future of HomeKit and Apple's Home app. I love having a connected home and it's clear Apple is committed to making the smart home all the more awesome.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Mail Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple Google’s Pixel didn’t just copy the iPhone 6 design, it copied a crazy iPhone 4 ‘feature’ as well Zach Epstein BGR NewsMarch 2, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share It’s pretty strange how defensive Android fans get when you make an observation that is beyond obvious to anyone with two eyes. Actually, it’s pretty obvious to anyone with one eye, too. The Google Pixel copied Apple’s iPhone 6 design. You should’ve seen the emails and tweets we got after running this post. Seriously, is it even really such a big deal? HTC cloned Apple’s iPhone 6, and that phone ended up selling quite well for the struggling smartphone maker. What’s funny is that Apple’s iPhone 6 is styled in a way that looks very similar to HTC’s old HTC One line, though Apple used a much different shape on its devices. Meanwhile, HTC’s A-series phones are a spitting image of the iPhone, and the Pixel is pretty much an iPhone 6 with a piece of glass slapped on the back. Now, in a funny and peculiar turn of event, it looks like Google dug much deeper into Apple’s pocket than we thought. Not only did the company ape Apple’s iPhone 6 design, it also borrowed an old iPhone “feature” that dates all the way back to 2010. Don't Miss: 10 reasons why not even the best Android phones can get iPhone users to switch Once upon a time, there was a slick new iPhone. It was the first iPhone Apple released with an all glass and metal build, and Apple achieved the feat by utilizing a novel antenna design that placed the antennas on the outside of the phone. It was a brilliant move in theory. In practice, there was one teeny tiny problem: it made the iPhone 4 unusable as a phone for many people. Why? Because holding it with your hand covering a certain part of the antennas would cause signal to drop off. Then-CEO Steve Jobs tried to play it cool at first — remember when he replied to someone complaining about the problem and told hit to “just avoid holding it that way”? — but Apple ended up having to hand out free bumper cases to all iPhone 4 owners so that they provided a barrier between the user’s hand and the antennas. Apple then fixed its design on future iPhones so that they were no longer affected. With all that in mind, enjoy this brief video of a “secret hidden feature” on the Google Pixel XL (via Reddit): Trending right now: One of Vizio’s best sound bars is on sale again on Amazon Exclusive: This is the Galaxy S8 10 reasons why not even the best Android phones can get iPhone users to switch See the original version of this article on BGR.com Reblog Share Tweet Share What to Read Next IBM to build quantum computers, selling machines millions of times faster than anything made before The Independent Unlimited Data Talk and Text Sprint®Sponsored Score an Apple Mac Mini desktop computer for just $400 on Best Buy Digital Trends New leaked photos give us a crystal clear look at the Galaxy S8 BGR News New report reaffirms the most exciting new iPhone 8 feature BGR News

The spot is a continuation of Apple’s iPad Pro commercials that directly respond to real tweets from real people. iPad Pro — Take better notes is a direct response to @jeszka24, who tweeted, “My math notes are a mess since I’m half asleep.” This spot, and the one below, work a bit better for me than the previous one, but it could be that I’m just in a good mood. Need Less Stuff The company released a second spot called iPad Pro — Need less stuff in response to @LixHewett. She tweeted, “There are way too many things on my desk.” In this commercial, Apple argues you can use iPad Pro to “replace a scanner, a pad of paper, and a laptop, so you can get rid of all that old stuff.” It then ends with a not-funny-attempt-at-being-weird-and-quirky where the actress playing the tweeter says she won’t get rid of her large ventriloquist dummy. Up until that point, I thought this spot’s message was clear and well-delivered. Your mileage may vary.

Forcing it to be so actually decreases my efficiency. That’s a personal use-case scenario, sure, but nevertheless, it is. For what it’s worth: Google bribed their way into education, I witnessed some of these deals firsthand in California. Apple’s products are so much better, and greed, not functionality, is pushing them out in spite of that superiority. Seriously, in my own experience, a lot of kids preferred pen and paper to the Chromebooks that were foisted on them. Something is going to have to be done about corrupt school boards if Apple wants to gain any traction again.

March 4, 2017 at 11:52 EST AM paikinho March 4, 2017 I would have loved this in college. My efficiency would have gone up a tic. Jamie is right about the chrome books. My daughter has had one issue by the school, because everything is on the cloud as far as her assignments and such. Unfortunately she has to get at it with a slow, sluggish chromebook that is not very functional and wastes much of her time. When she gets home she is dying to jump on the MacBook Pro so she can sail through her work. It is just a vastly more efficient way of doing the same thing and that is without all the touch screen stuff. It would be interesting to get a keyboard setup for the iPad Pro we just got for the holidays and see if that would be better still or not. Fun experiment. March 4, 2017 at 12:26 EST PM geoduck March 4, 2017 The iPad Pro, especially the one coming out this year, will be powerful enough to do emulation. Imagine if Apple came out with a basic shell to let you run a limited selection of Apps, word processors, spreadsheets, the sort of thing that wouldn’t stumble from a slowdown, on the iPad Pro. Part of this Emulation App would allow support for a wireless mouse. Sure it wouldn’t rum massive games or Autocad. It would however take care of those bits that are needed to make the iPad Pro into a true laptop replacement for a LOT of people. March 4, 2017 at 8:13 EST PM geoduck March 4, 2017 “…limited selection of Mac Apps…” March 4, 2017 at 8:14 EST PM mactoid March 5, 2017 Can anyone tell what note taking app is being used?

Assembly Elections 2017: Is Modi on a road to nowhere in Uttar Pradesh? NEW DELHI: Apple recorded the fastest growth in the Indian tablet market in the quarter ended December 2016 and made it into the top five, even as the segment shrank 3.1% to 3.7 million units for the year. The declining trend, which has been consistent over the past few years, is expected to continue, analysts at two research firms said. Apple’s shipments in the December quarter grew 16% from the preceding one and 17% from the year earlier, said analysts at International Data Corporation (IDC) India, adding that the Cupertino-based company had moved up the rankings after a long time. “While iPad Air 2 remained the topselling model for Apple, constituting half its total shipments, the iPad Pro accounted for 22.7% of India’s total detachable category in 2016,” IDC said Thursday. Detachables, which come with keyboards that can removed, are a subset of the tablet market. For the quarter and year ended December, the top four tablet makers by volume were Datawind, Samsung, Lenovo and iBall, in that order. Micromax was fifth for the full year and Apple took the slot in the fourth quarter. Cybermedia Research (CMR) reported a sharper 18% on-year fall in tablet shipments in 2016, to 3.5 million units, with Datawind leading the market, followed by Samsung, Pantel and Micromax. IDC analysts said consumer demand for tablets will decline in the coming years thanks to smartphones with large screens, reflecting a global trend as buyers hold on to their old devices instead of buying new ones. Commercial shipments may partially offset this with adoption having increased recently. The segment grew 35% in the full year. “We expect this to grow further in coming quarters,” said IDC India senior analyst Karthik J. “Detachables are expected to continue with healthy double-digit growth in 2016.” CMR expects data bundling and a strategic focus on industries such as healthcare or cab aggregators to provide some growth. But consolidation is set to hit this segment as well, the firm said, predicting that only six to seven players may remain, having dropped to 22 from 66 in 2015. Fourth-quarter tablet shipments fell 19.6% from the preceding one and 4.3% from the year earlier to 820,000 units. “This is primarily due to seasonal decline after festive spike in Q3 and demonetization limiting the consumer sales in the last quarter of the year,” IDC said. IDC said the detachables category grew 30.7% in 2016, driven by demand from both the consumer and commercial segments. Acer accounted for almost a fourth of them, followed by Apple’s iPad Pro. 4G tablets accounted for almost 25% of total tablet shipments in 2016, up from 6% in the previous year, both research agencies said.

The iPhone 5 is getting older which puts a greater importance on each update Apple releases for the former flagship. Apple’s iOS updates for older devices can have a dramatic effect on a device’s performance. Sometimes the effect is positive. Sometimes its negative. Apple’s latest iOS 10 update for the iPhone 5 is a small but important update. The iPhone 5 iOS 10.2.1 update is much smaller than iOS 10.2 but it brings some notable changes to the device. If you’re making the move from the iOS 10.2 update, your iOS 10.2.1 update will be tiny, only a few megabytes. If you’re coming from something older than iOS 10.2 you can expect your update to be much larger thanks to the features and fixes from previous iPhone 5 iOS upgrades. They are baked into iOS 10.2.1. This roundup will take you through our impressions of the iPhone 5 iOS 10.2.1 update’s performance and it will guide you through some of the key things to keep in mind as we push toward Apple’s next iOS 10 release. We’ll continue to update this roundup with new details as we get them so keep an eye out for frequent changes. iPhone 5 iOS 10.2.1 Review: One Week Later   1 / 9 The iPhone 5 iOS 10.2.1 update is tiny and it'll only take you a few minutes to download and install. It took us about three minutes to download the update over a fast Wi-Fi speed network and about five minutes to finish up the installation.  We recommend setting aside 10-15 quiet minutes where you can monitor both the download and installation without distractions.  We've been using the iPhone 5 iOS 10.2.1 update for a week now and the update is still holding up nicely on our AT&T model.  The iPhone 5's battery continues to work miracles. We haven't noticed any abnormal battery drain during our time with iOS 10.2.1 though that could certainly change down the road. We've tested the iPhone 5 and its new update with several different ISPs, routers and Bluetooth devices. We haven't noticed any major issues during our week with the upgrade. AT&T's LTE and 4G networks are working fine as well.  Random reboots were an issue for us on iOS 10.2 though we haven't noticed any during our time on iOS 10.2.1. That's a big improvement, at least for us. UI speed is decent. Most animations and transitions are fast and fluid and we haven't experienced any lag when opening up Control Center.  The user interface still lags when opening up folders and some apps but that's par for the course. Remember, this phone is over four years old.  If you're already on iOS 10.2, iOS 10.2.1's fixes and security patches definitely make it worth a look. Performance is also a plus at the week milestone.  If you're on something older than the iOS 10.2 update, make sure you dig into more feedback before you make the jump to iOS 10.2.1.  For more on the merits of iOS 10.2.1, see our list of reasons to and not to install the iOS 10.2.1 update on your iPhone.   1 / 9 4 Responses 12/19/2016 Facebook lite apk Reply i like ios 10.2 more than 10.1. power berry slow lost 02/24/2017 Kent Reply After installing 10.2.1 on my iPhone 5s I started getting random reboots. At least 10 per day. If plugged into the charger, the reboots seemed to go away. 02/27/2017 Jarvis Reply Hi guys, I am using iPhone 5s with ios 9.3.3. I am getting reminders to update to whitetail 10.2.1 I’m not sure though, if I should go for an update or not since Internet is poisoned about 30% battery bug in ios 10. I’m new to iPhone, have almost no past experience of ios. As of now I am pretty satisfied with ios 9.3.3 just sometimes it becomes difficult to click on( x) while trying to close search box with some other minor hiccups, don’t know if it’s a software issue or hardware on my device. I’m kinda liking the health app. Although it is not measuring the floors climbed while it’s counting the steps taken. I am told it will count the floors climbed after I updated to 10.2.1 which kind of sounds weird. Please suggest me the right course of action. By the way what’s Jailbreak? Hoping to hear from you soon. 03/03/2017 Natasha Reply Updated to 10.2.1 yesterday and my phone wont start at all and has been at the Apple logo + loading bar screen for over 24 hours. :( Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

Anders Bylund (TMFZahrim) Mar 3, 2017 at 9:33PM Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) knows what it's doing. The company is a market leader in many fields, and would often rather abandon a product category rather than struggle on as a minor competitor to bigger and better rivals. But even mighty Apple does the occasional swing-and-a-miss routine. And some of Cupertino's whiffs come in vibrant billion-dollar markets. Image source: Getty Images. Apple ranks dead last in the $24 billion file-hosting market Brand Keys is a branding consultancy firm with more than three decades of expertise-building history under its belt. The firm is best known for its Customer Loyalty Engagement Index (CLEI) rankings, where a proprietary data-collection process builds customer-loyalty ratings in more than 80 specific product categories. Apple, of course, dominates several of the latest Brand Keys ratings. The iPhone shows up all comers in the smartphone category, no tablet can beat the iPad's consumer loyalty, and MacBooks walks away with the top rating among laptop brands. In something of an upset, Apple Music even takes home the online music segment. And then there's the file-storage category. There, Apple doesn't just miss the top spot, but falls all the way to the bottom of 13 ranked services. How bad is that result for Apple? To be clear, Brand Keys claims that its measurements translate directly into future sales prospects and revenues. According to independent metrics from Markets and Markets, cloud storage is a $24 billion market today -- and expected to reach annual sales of $75 billion in just five years. In other words, it looks like Apple is leaving a lot of cash on the table. The iCloud file-storage service is not pulling its weight, or moving the needle for Apple. Instead, consumers with a need for off-site file-storage tools prefer free services like Brand Keys' category winner, Sabrecat -- or a plethora of better-known options such as runner-up Dropbox, or third-place finisher Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Drive. Apple is not only missing a significant market opportunity, but leaving a lot of that cash for Google parent Alphabet to grab instead. Apple CEO Tim Cook. Image source: Apple. Why is Apple missing the boat? Apple's iCloud is, in many ways, very similar to Google Drive and Dropbox. All three services allow users to store nearly any type of file in a centrally managed cloud server, accessible from any networked computer. They all come with small storage limits for a free account, all offer a terabyte of storage for $9.99 per month, and come with various tools for managing your stored files. But Apple does a few things differently. First and foremost, the easiest way to access iCloud content is via an iPhone, iPad, or MacBook. In fact, signing up for an iCloud account is part of the setup process for all of these systems. Then, the service is integrated into your Apple experience as the destination for system backup files, the default storage location for files created in the iWork office suite, and an option for storing user files in newer versions of the macOS system. All of this is designed to keep users tightly bound to Apple's multi-device ecosystem. Once you're in, it's not easy to get untangled. Given Apple's massive market reach, especially in the tablet and smartphone segments, this alone should make iCloud a winner. Apple CEO Tim Cook introduced the package as "a strategy for the next decade" in 2012. However, Apple never quite delivered on that grand ambition. iCloud is reportedly ostracized by other working groups within the company, starved of resources, and mostly seen as a necessary evil. Apple is a product company, and iCloud is not a marketable product on its own -- at least not in its current Apple-centric form. So, this odd piece of infrastructure machinery is left out in the cold. And there goes Apple's ticket to a $24 billion industry that's also on a rapid growth tear. Google sure is building its Drive product into everything from Gmail to mobile photo storage to storage space for corporate accounts. Dropbox is doing the same, while on the lookout for another buyout bid. And this market should only grow faster as the Internet of Things grows up, requiring acres of cloud-based storage space. These companies treat online file storage as an important business, valuable on its own merits. Apple doesn't. Hence, the company is holding back on promoting iCloud, developing it further, or building it into other products, when appropriate. Cupertino misses out on a major growth story, with absolutely no loyalty from the customers who do sign up.

As was standard for the time, it came in 16/64/128GB configurations. Since then, Apple has bumped the base storage options on new iPhones to 32GB, but the 16GB iPhone 6 (and iPhone SE) have remained on sale. So it’s a little unusual that Apple has put a 32GB iPhone 6 on sale in China in a gold color. What’s even stranger is that the phone isn’t available through Apple retail channels, but instead only through Taiwan Mobile. Don't Miss: The first ‘Deadpool 2’ teaser is here, and it’s hilarious 9to5Mac spotted that Taiwan Mobile is pushing the gold 32GB iPhone 6 as an exclusive offer on its network as the cheapest iPhone ever. It’s only being sold as part of a monthly contract, so it’s difficult to compare the cost to the iPhone SE or iPhone 6 in North America, but it does seem to be cheap. Adding a 32GB iPhone 6 option for the low-end is a confusing move for Apple. The iPhone SE is meant to fill the niche for a cheap(er) iPhone, and making the storage on the 6 bigger than the SE might cannibalize sales for Apple. At the same time, it might work as a way to sell people on a cheap iPhone that doesn’t look cheap. While the SE is visually an iPhone from years ago, the iPhone 6 still looks mostly identical to the more modern iPhone 7. It’s still unclear if the iPhone SE is going to get a spec bump this year. The original SE debuted in the spring of 2016, so sometime in the next few months would be the time to update it, assuming Apple sticks to its regular update cycle.

IDC New Zealand reports Apple shipped less than 1000 more detachable or slate devices than Microsoft in 2016. The total market for the year was 80,000 units. Apple had a 32 percent market share, which is around 25,600 units. Microsoft was at 31 percent, a shade under 25,000 units. Detachable is a curious market to measure. IDC defines it: "A slate tablet is a portable, battery-powered computing device with a screen size 7-inches to 16-inches. In addition to the attributes of a slate tablet, a detachable tablet is designed to function as a stand-alone slate tablet as well as a clamshell device through the addition of a detachable keyboard designed specifically for the device." IDC New Zealand mobile device market analyst Chayse Gorton says this includes Apple's 12.9-inch and 9.7-inch iPad Pros. Yet both sell without detachable keyboards and not every buyer uses them with one1. The category includes Microsoft Surface Pro and Surface Book, HP Envy and others. It is distinct from traditional laptops. The distinction between slates and tablets like non-Pro iPads is blurry. Either way, Apple topped the market in 2016. Microsoft is second. It had been number one for the years 2013, 2014 and 2015. Microsoft's shipments climbed three percent from 2015 to 2016. It was a bonza year for detachable sales. Shipments2 increased from 55,000 in 2015 to 80,000 — a year-on-year increase of 45 percent. The runners-up are, in order: HP on nine percent; Samsung on seven percent and Acer also with seven percent. Other brands were less than 15%. Gorton says Microsoft faces competition from a range of models running Windows. Its share of the Windows detachable market fell from 58 percent in 2015 to 50 percent in 2016. "Competing windows detachables often have similar specifications to Microsoft detachables, but are frequently sold at a lower price. Given New Zealand is a price conscious nation, a lower price, even by small a margin can be enough to entice a consumer to purchase from a competing vendor", he says. Gorton says Microsoft sharpened its premium market position introducing high-end models and halting low-end models. It introduced the Surface Book early in the year and dropped the Surface 3 from its line-up. IDC expects detachable shipments to grow between 25 and 30 percent in 2017. From the market will start to flatten off. You could argue the iPad Pro and Windows devices are not direct head-to-head rivals. It's possible there are buyers who would weigh up an iPad Pro against these Windows devices. Yet for the most part the two groups inhabit parallel universes. Shipments is a normal term for this kind of survey. Most of the time it means how many devices vendors sent from warehouses to retailers. It gets tricky with detachable because Apple and Microsoft sell direct.

Phones by Richard Trenholm February 28, 2017 4:14 AM PST @rich_trenholm Enlarge Image Apple's iPhone 7 committed to Lightning over the traditional headphone jack. Screenshot by Óscar Gutiérrez/CNET Apple's iPhone could celebrate its 10th birthday with a curved screen and USB-C connection. According to the Wall Street Journal, at least one model in Apple's next update to the iPhone range could have a curved OLED screen, similar to the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge. More intriguingly, the Journal quotes anonymous sources claiming the new iPhone would ditch Apple's proprietary Lightning connection for USB-C. USB cables for syncing and charging are standard across the mobile industry, but Apple has always stuck with its own charging connection. Shifting to USB-C would be a huge move for Apple. It would also be a surprise, as Apple's iPhone 7 controversially moved away from another industry standard, the 3.5mm headphone jack, in favor of Lightning. With that commitment to Lightning in mind, you may want to take this little rumor with a pinch of salt. The report also suggested an end to the home button, which would free space for a slimmer bezel -- but it's not clear where Apple would put the fingerprint scanner. Apple has yet to respond to a request for comment. Correction, 6:24 a.m. PT: This story originally misstated the industry-standard headphone jack size. It is 3.5mm. Does the Mac still matter? Apple execs tell why the MacBook Pro was over four years in the making, and why we should care. It's Complicated: This is dating in the age of apps. Having fun yet?

The first, called ‘take better notes’ starts, like similar recent videos, with a tweet: ‘My math notes are a mess since I’m half asleep.’ In response, the narrator explains ‘You know, iPad Pro and Apple Pencil have revolutionized the way we take notes.’ The camera cuts to someone taking notes in Notability, the note-taking app that Federico highlighted in the iPad Diaries this week. The spot concludes with the narrator pointing out that even if you fall asleep, you’re covered if you use Notability’s audio recording feature. The second video is called ‘need less stuff,’ which emphasizes the ways the iPad Pro can cut down on clutter in your life. In response to a ‘There are way too many things on my desk’ tweet, the narrator explains that an iPad Pro can replace a scanner, a pad of paper, and laptop, using the iPad version of Procreate as the example of an app that replaces a pad of paper. Apple continues to strike a nice balance with these videos, highlighting a couple features of the iPad Pro that set it apart from a laptop or smart phone but keeping the tone light and humorous by responding to the sort of frustrated tweets with which many people are all too familiar.

Woodvine on March 4th, 2017 at 5:29 PM 1 of 1 2 of 1 At least 147 U.S. tech companies now publicly oppose President Trump’s so-called Muslim travel ban, including some of the most capitalized and influential corporations in the world, such as Apple, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and Intel. The backlash from the tech sector began within days of January 26, when President Trump signed his executive order banning certain immigrants from entering the United States, including all Syrian refugees and anyone from seven predominantly Muslim nations. Most recently, Yahoo and Tumblr filed an amicus brief on Friday (February 17), in support of Darweesh v. Trump—one of nearly 50 court challenges to the travel ban. Seemingly, all the other 145-plus tech companies publicly opposed to the travel ban have associated themselves with the well-publicized lawsuit State of Washington and State of Minnesota v. Trump. It is this latter legal action, commonly called Washington v. Trump, which has been blocking implementation of the travel ban since February 3 and which a U.S. Court of Appeals in San Francisco refused to quash in a unanimous ruling on February 9. In their amicus brief, Yahoo and Tumblr neatly sum up the pro-immigration attitude of all the tech companies opposed to the Trump travel ban: “Immigrants to the U.S. bring with them immense talent and entrepreneurship that help drive the innovation economy. Yahoo was founded by Jerry Yang and David Filo—two Stanford grad students, one from Taiwan and one from Louisiana—so we know firsthand that great things can happen when America welcomes the world’s best and brightest.” However, the tech companies’ arguments against the travel ban are rooted less in warm humanist virtue than in hard economic necessity. The U.S. education system, the companies say, does not produce anywhere near enough Americans with the requisite computer science skills to fill more than a fraction of U.S. tech jobs; therefore it is absolutely necessary to attract a constant influx of the world’s “best and brightest” in order for the tech sector in the United States just to survive, let alone thrive. Keep in mind that opposing a newly-elected president who is carrying out a campaign promise is not—strictly speaking—a good business move; rather it is a sure way to piss off millions of voters/consumers. I take the fact that so many tech companies (almost all of them dependent on consumer sales) have been willing to come out against Trump’s travel ban as proof of two things. That the companies see the travel ban and similar anti-immigration policies as truly threatening their survival and that they can count well enough to know that more U.S. consumers voted for Hillary Clinton (65,844,954, or 48.2 percent) than for Donald Trump (62,979,879, or 46.1 percent). President Trump keeps a divisive campaign promise In brief, U.S president Donald Trump’s travel ban–properly titled “Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States”, which Trump signed on January 26 as Executive Order 13769, does the following: Permanently closes the U.S. borders to all Syrian refugees. Closes the U.S. borders for 90 days to immigrants and travellers from seven predominantly Muslim countries (Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen)—including immigrants with valid U.S. visas. After 90 days the list of banned countries will be revised and perhaps even expanded. Suspends for 120 days the troubled U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP). Caps to 50,000 the total number of refugees allowed in the U.S in 2017. Instant legal challenges On January 30—only four days after the Executive Order was signed—Washington State Attorney General Bob Ferguson (later joined by the attorney general of Minnesota) was in a Seattle U.S. District Court seeking to have the executive order declared “illegal and unconstitutional”. Ferguson argued that the Muslim travel ban was both discriminatory and directly harmed the interests of the state’s residents as well as the foreign students and lecturers attending state educational institutions. On February 3, U.S. District Judge James L. Robart sided with Washington State and granted a temporary restraining order against key elements of Trump’s executive order. On February 9, a three-judge panel of the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco, California, unanimously denied the Trump administration’s request to lift the temporary restraining order stopping the U.S. government from enforcing much of the travel ban. This effectively threw the matter back to the U.S. District Court in Seattle, Washington, where it began. On February 27, the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals refused to put a hold on the Washington v. Trump suit seeking to overturn the current travel ban, despite claims by the Trump administration that it is readying a differently formulated travel ban, intended to be immune from judicial challenge. On February 28 it was widely reported that the newly revised travel ban would drop Iraq from the list of banned countries of origin. The U.S. tech sector stands for immigration The U.S. information technology sector only needed to look at itself in a mirror to see why it had to oppose the Trump administration’s specifically Islamophobic and generally xenophobic immigration travel ban: Current Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella was born in Hyderabad, India. Google co-founder Sergey Brin was a refugee from the former Soviet Union. Current Google CEO Sundar Pichai was born in Madurai, Tamil Nadu, India. Twitter’s executive chairman Omid Kordestani was born in Iran. Apple co-founder Steve Jobs was the son of a Syrian immigrant. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos‘s step-dad immigrated to the U.S. from Cuba. Expedia CEO Dara Khosrowshahi was a refugee fleeing the 1978 Iranian Revolution. California entrepreneur Safi Qureshey—a practicing Muslim born in Pakistan—cofounded the (now defunct) U.S. personal computer company AST Research in 1980. And on and on. Besides the gifted foreign-born entrepreneurs and executives mentioned above (some of whom have slowly risen up through the corporate ranks), U.S. tech companies appear to be very dependent on attracting very large numbers of foreign-born computer science graduates, in order to fill positions in middle management and below. It's all thanks to a massive ongoing shortfall in skilled American computer graduates. According to several sources, including the Atlantic, there are  currently about half a million computer jobs to be filled in the U.S. tech sector. But only about 43,000 Americans graduate college annually with the required computer science degrees to fill these jobs. Meanwhile, considerably more than one million  IT engineers graduate in China and India every year, according to Newsweek. The U.S. government has been trying, in fits and starts, to grow the number of American science graduates for decades. Most recently the Obama administration tried hard but was largely unable to convince a Republican-held Congress to approve a package of programs designed to produce more college graduates in the so-called STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) fields. Simply put, the U.S. technology companies which are opposed to Trump’s travel ban say that in lieu of a large-enough pool of sufficiently skilled Americans, they must hire skilled foreign workers. And insofar as the travel ban makes it difficult for U.S. tech companies to attract and keep the best-qualified foreign-born workers, it does real harm to the long-term prospects of the U.S. tech sector, which is a significant segment of the U.S. economy, accounting for millions of good domestic jobs and trillions of dollars of domestic spending. How the tech opposition to Trump’s travel ban evolved First off, on January 31, Amazon and Expedia (both based in Washington state) each filed declarations joining the Washington lawsuit against the travel ban. Amazon’s motion cites the travel ban’s adverse affects on both employees and prospective employees, including a Libyan-born Amazon lawyer with British citizenship, as well as 49 employees born in the seven Muslim-majority countries included in the ban. Expedia’s motion says that the ban could damage its international travel business, considering that at least 1,000 of its customers hold passports from the seven restricted countries. On February 6, 96 U.S. companies filed an amicus brief in support of the suit against the ban, including many of the heaviest hitters in tech: AdRoll • Aeris Communications • Airbnb • AltSchool • Ancestry.com • Appboy • Apple • AppNexus Inc. • Asana, Inc. • Atlassian Corp Plc • Autodesk • Automattic • Box • Brightcove • Brit + Co • CareZone • Castlight Health • Checkr • Chobani • Citrix Systems • Cloudera • Cloudflare • Copia Institute • DocuSign • DoorDash • Dropbox • Dynatrace • eBay • Engine Advocacy • Etsy • Facebook • Fastly • Flipboard • Foursquare Labs • Fuze • General Assembly • GitHub • Glassdoor • Google • GoPro • Harmonic • Hipmunk • Indiegogo • Intel Corporation • JAND, Inc. d/b/a Warby Parker • Kargo Global • Kickstarter • KIND • Knotel • Levi Strauss & Co. • LinkedIn Corporation • Lithium Technologies, Inc. • Lyft • Mapbox • Maplebear Inc. d/b/a Instacart • Marin Software Incorporated • Medallia, Inc. • A Medium Corporation • Meetup, Inc. • Microsoft Corporation • Motivate International • Mozilla Corporation • Netflix • NETGEAR • NewsCred • Patreon • PayPal Holdings, Inc. • Pinterest • Quora • Reddit • Rocket Fuel • SaaStr • Salesforce.com, Inc. • Scopely • Shutterstock • Snap • Spokeo • Spotify USA • Square • Squarespace • Strava • Stripe • SurveyMonkey • TaskRabbit • Tech:NYC • Thumbtack • Turn Inc. • Twilio • Twitter • Uber Technologies, Inc. • Via • Wikimedia Foundation, Inc. • Workday • Y Combinator Management, LLC • Yelp • Zynga.   By the evening of February 6, another 31 companies had reportedly joined the brief, including Adobe Systems, Tesla, and Space X, bringing the total to 129: Adobe Systems Incorporated • Affirm, Inc. • Ampush • Brocade Communications Systems • Bungie • Casper Sleep • Cavium • Chegg • ClassPass • Coursera • EquityZen Inc. • Evernote • Gusto • Handy Technologies • HP • IAC/InterActiveCorp • Linden Lab • Managed By Q • MobileIron • New Relic • Pandora Media • Planet Labs • RPX Corporation • Shift Technologies • Slack Technologies • SpaceX • Tesla • TripAdvisor • Udacity • Zendesk • Zenefits.   Between February 7 and 9 a minimum of 16 more companies joined the Technology Companies amicus brief, bringing the total to at least 145: Akamai Technologies, Inc. • CREDO Mobile, Inc. • DiCentral • Fitbit, Inc. • Groupon • Medidata Solutions • Molecule Software, Inc. • MongoDB, Inc. • Pivotal Software • Postmates • Redfin • Quantcast Corp. • SoundCloud, Inc. • Skycatch, Inc. • SpotHero • WHOmentors.com, Inc.   The late addition of Yahoo and Tumbler on February 17 brings the total to at least 147. The tech companies in Trump’s corner Donald Trump does have his supporters in the tech sector. Notable U.S. technology companies that have not voiced opposition to the travel ban include: AT&T • Cisco • General Electric • IBM • Oracle • Palantir Technologies • Sprint • T-Mobile • Verizon • WeWork. Notably, AT&T, Cisco, IBM, and Palantir do very little or none of their business with the general public. AT&T, in particular, dares not anger Donald Trump because it needs his administration’s approval of its huge merger with Time Warner, the owner of CNN. IBM’s CEO Ginni Rometty is a member of Trump’s business advisory council and in November 2016 wrote an open letter to president-elect Trump on the subject of creating “new collar” jobs, wherein she promised that IBM would bring 25,000 more jobs to the U.S. Oracle’s CEO Israeli-born Safra Catz was part of Trump’s transition team and Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins has gone on record as supporting Trump’s tax reform policies. Palantir Technologies CEO Alex Karp attended Trump’s tech summit but more to the point, the data mining software company is firmly in the Trump administration’s pocket. Palantir was cofounded by Trump supporter Peter Thiel with backing from Q-Tel, the CIA’s venture arm and counts the FBI, Pentagon, and IRS among its largest clients. And to paraphrase Intercept, Palantir is providing the engine for Donald Trump’s deportation machine. Is Trump trying to prevent terrorism or cause it? The majority of mass killing incidents in the United States have been committed by citizens born in the United States and the common thread that connects all the terrorists—domestic and foreign—from the Unabomber to Timothy McVeigh to Omar Mir Seddique Mateen to Osama Bin Laden—isn’t nationality or religion, it is the nihilistic surrender to extremism, hate, and murder. Between 1975 and 2015, nationals from five of the banned countries (two Iraqis, six Iranians, two Somalis, six Sudanese, and one Yemeni) were convicted of attempting or executing terrorist attacks on U.S. but all the same, no one from the seven banned countries killed anyone in terrorist attacks on U.S. soil during that period. None of the perpetrators of terrorist attacks in the U.S. claiming 10 or more victims were from one of the seven banned countries. The majority of attacks were committed by people born in the U.S. Over the last four decades, only 20 of 3.25 million refugees have been convicted of attempting or committing terrorism on U.S. soil. Only three Americans have been killed in attacks committed by refugees—all by Cubans in the 1970s. None of the birth countries of people who have killed people in U.S. (Afghanistan, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia) are affected by Trump’s travel ban. No Muslim-majority countries where the Trump Organization holds business interests, such as Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Turkey, the U.A.E., and Azerbaijan are affected by the ban. Arguably, only someone ignorant of the actual history of terrorism in the United States could imagine that Trump’s Muslim-centric travel ban could do anything to reduce the threat of such acts on U.S. soil. However, I do not consider Trump to be unintelligent, just uncaring of the larger consequences of his self-centred actions; I see him as someone who would burn down a forest just to warm his little hands. Trump also looks to me like a man in a hurry to start something. His March 2 speech aboard a U.S. aircraft carrier wearing a flight jacket and an admiral’s cap suggests how badly he wants an excuse to dress up as the warrior—Il Duce-style; to clothe himself and his actions in the wardrobe of scoundrels and by that I mean jingoistic “love it or leave it” patriotism. I admit that it’s a terrible thing to suggest, that Trump’s travel ban may be coldly calculated to provoke the very terrorism that it speaks of thwarting; likely it’s just the simpler sort of pandering bigotry that one associates with a populist demagogue of Trump’s stripe. Either way I’m sure that its purpose doesn’t extend much beyond selfish political considerations on Trump’s part. And I agree wholeheartedly with the technology companies opposed to the travel ban that whatever comes of it will be to the expense and detriment of the United States. And you know that something’s really rotten when you find yourself in perfect accord with a bunch of avaricious corporate entities such as Apple, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and Intel.

As well as strengthening security for Windows endpoints, Centrify has joined AppConfig.org to streamline app and device provisioning, extend IT security policy and provide end-users with more device choices. These enhancements to Centrify’s mobile-centric identity management solutions let organisations further realise seamless, context-aware policy across all the applications, endpoints and devices their users prefer – all from a single integrated solution. Centrify has made these developments available immediately in Australia and New Zealand through its Identity Service, Privilege Service and Server Suite. Learn more at https://www.centrify.com/products/. Age of Access Centrify recognises that it is critical to enable user choice while maintaining a highly secure environment in today’s age of access. Centrify’s new Windows management features let IT organisations manage Windows endpoints from the cloud - including blocking app access from unmanaged devices - and further extends Centrify’s Zero Sign-On capabilities to Windows. After users are securely authenticated the first time, they never have to type in their ID again when launching an app. More Mobile Endpoints This new feature builds on and extends Centrify’s existing industry-leading identity support for Mac, iOS. Linux and Android endpoints, as well as its Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) support for Linux and Windows login and privilege elevation. Combined with Centrify’s recently released Analytics Service, which uses machine learning to assess risk based on user behaviour patterns, Centrify’s extended service provides organisations with help to stop anomalous access requests across apps, sites, and resources. Centrify has furthered its commitment to securing access to the boundaryless hybrid enterprise by joining AppConfig, a collection of industry leading enterprise mobility management solution providers and app developers that collaborate to make it easier for developers and customers to drive mobility in business. The community’s mission is to streamline the adoption and deployment of mobile enterprise applications by providing a standard approach to app configuration and management, building upon the extensive app security and configuration frameworks available in the OS.  Centrify Senior Director APAC Sales Niall King said security needed to move from a legacy static perimeter-based approach to protect millions of scattered connections in an increasingly boundaryless hybrid enterprise. “Centrify’s goal is to stop breaches through the power of identity services,” he said. “By tightly integrating mobile and identity policy into a single solution, we are creating a more robust way to ensure that only the right people have access to the right apps and data from managed devices.” More devices protected, better security Centrify Identity Service enables organisations to extract more value from their investment by allowing greater endpoint choice, without compromising security. As well as provisioning new user accounts into cloud and mobile apps, Centrify can also push those apps to the users’ BYOD or corporate-owned devices and push the initial configuration to speed day-one productivity across any and all endpoints. This assists organisations to increase productivity and eliminate helpdesk calls by accelerating the process of setting up new users with day-one provisioning of both endpoints and apps. They also save money by securing applications - and the endpoints used to access those apps - from a single context-aware solution. Centrify also leverages endpoints such as Windows as a way to facilitate MFA to enable stronger authentication and reduce an organisation’s reliance on password-based security.

Google’s flagship device will face competition from the likes of Samsung’s Galaxy S8, Apple’s iPhone 8 and LG’s G6. But the device’s main rival in the market will definitely be the Galaxy S8. Both companies will have a lot to prove with their devices. While the Galaxy S8 is Samsun's first major device post the Galaxy Note 7 scandal, the Pixel 2 — as it is expected to be called — is Google’s chance to build on the initial success of the Pixel device. It also presents a chance for Google to improve on the hardware and software flaws that the device suffered from despite its initial success. Let’s see how the two devices stack up against each other in terms of specs: Performance Both the Google Pixel 2 and the Samsung Galaxy S8 are expected to come with a 10nm technology based Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor. While Samsung has the entire supply of the processor reserved for the S8, which is expected to launch in March or April, the Google Pixel 2 is expected to release in October 2017, there is a fair chance that the company gets its hands on the processor. Display The Samsung Galaxy S8 is expected to come in 5-inch and 6-inch models, while Pixel series 2 is also expected to have a similar lineup. While the edge-to-edge display for the Samsung Galaxy S8 is mostly confirmed, according to Pocket Lint, if Google wants to compete with the major flagships in the market, it will have to endow its Pixel 2 device with one. While Samsung is expected to go for a display-embedded fingerprint sensor for the S8, Google is expected to continue with the rear-mounted one on the current Pixel device. Camera According to Sammobile, the Samsung Galaxy S8 is expected to come with a dual-camera setup comprising of a 12-megapixel camera sensor accompanied by a 13-megapixel one, which will help create a better depth of field in images. Google will have much to build on for its Google Pixel 2 handset since its current device has been rated as the best smartphone camera yet by DxO Mark. According to 9to5 Google, the company is currently developing a camera lens, which could have an improved low-light condition performance. In addition to this, both devices are also expected to have waterproof bodies. While Samsung already espouses the standard in its existing device – the Samsung Galaxy S7, Google is expected to endow its Pixel 2 device with either an IP67 or IP68 certified body, according to Trusted Reviews. While the Samsung Galaxy S8 is expected to have a price tag of $899, the Google Pixel 2 is expected to be launched later in October at $649.

A week after one analyst opined that the company ‘has Samsung on the ropes like never before,’ investment bank and brokerage company BTIG has raised its price target for the stock from $133 to $165. At the time of writing, the stock is trading at $136.99. BTIG says that it is basing the large boost in valuation on anticipated growth in both 2017 and 2018, as well as the potential for new product categories … Amazon Prime, free delivery, free videos We increased our fiscal 2017 revenue estimate by $8 billion to $226 billion and introduced a fiscal 2018 revenue estimate of $241 billion. Our new estimates imply 4.9% and 6.6% revenue growth in fiscal 2017 and 2018, respectively. Analyst Walter Piecyk says that although it expects both Mac and Services revenue to grow, this will be offset by further iPad decline. The iPhone is expected to be the key driver for growth, BTIG making the usual argument that a significant upgrade this year coupled to a high percentage of iPhone owners still using older phones creates the opportunity. The majority of iPhone users remain on legacy products and provide a latent opportunity for higher upgrade rates in 2017. The note suggests that the increase in earnings per share will hit double digits next year, growing by 5.4% in 2017 and 11.4% in 2018 – though it notes that these numbers do rely on Apple continuing its share buybacks of around $10B per quarter. BTIG also argues that increased R&D spending, coupled to an ever-growing cash pile available for acquisitions, means that the company is well-positioned to launch new product categories. Apple’s R&D budget has doubled in the past 3 years and risen to nearly 5% of revenue from nearly 3% in 2013 […] Apple has also grown its cash to $246 billion from $159 billion over past 3 years despite giving back $155 billion on dividends and share repurchase over that time. This provides management with tremendous flexibility to make acquisitions to enter new product or service categories, if its elevated R&D investments have not produced the desired results. The company says that there are ‘numerous directions’ in which the company could head, alluding to recent press coverage but not specifically referencing any particular category. Augmented reality does, however, appear to be one focus for Apple at present, with UBS yesterday suggesting that this tech could debut in the iPhone 8.

Its premium Thunderbolt Ensemble and flagship Symphony interfaces are among the top choices for industry professionals in terms of overall sound quality and unwavering support for Apple’s pro computers. The company has also dipped into the home/portable market with a series of fantastic boxes that bring Apogee’s professional mic-pres and D/A converter tech to a much more affordable price point with the One, Duet and Quartet. These new Thunderbolt audio interfaces for Mac represent a sweet spot in Apogee’s lineup, using the best technology from the company’s higher end machines while stripping out some of the bells and whistles to bring the price down drastically. That means they’re now the best value in the lineup in terms of the number of ins and outs you get versus the company’s less expensive One and Duet products, and the more expensive Quartet, and Ensemble products. You sacrifice physical controls and a display for metering on the box, but Apogee makes up for it with slick Mac and iOS apps, integration with Logic, and a new separate remote accessory… Luxury Book iPhone 7 Plus Case There are 3-models in the new lineup: Element 24, 46 and 88. They are all basically the same, just with more inputs/outputs and mic-pres (and of course higher-price points) on the higher-end models. You can even stack them together if you need to upgrade for more I/O at some point down the line. The two larger models support two separate headphone outputs, while the 24 just carries the one (you’ll find a comparison chart for all three right here). We’ve been giving the Element 88 a run for its money, along with the companion Mac/iOS apps and the add-on hardware remote Control. Head below for more on how this new function over form approach held up in action. My very first impressions of the system were positive. I unboxed it and had it all set-up and working over Thunderbolt on my Mac Pro and Logic Pro X within minutes. The companion app known as Element Control installs on your Mac as part of the installation process and acts as the main control center for Element. Don’t be alarmed by the basic hardware design of the machine. No, there is nothing but physical jacks on the box itself, but you’ll get complete control over every element of the recording process via the software (and Logic Pro X). As for the actual hardware, it’s a simple and basic design with the top-notch build-quality we’ve come to expect from Apogee. Along with the solid metal case and end cheeks, all of the connectors feel quite rugged and durable. You will have to provide your own Thunderbolt cable and only the largest Element 88 model includes the optional rack mounting kit. A quick note on the Thunderbolt connection/latency: One of the main benefits of using a Thunderbolt interface over USB is that it offers much lower latency performance. Element’s Thunderbolt connection has been great in my time with the box. Some of my heaviest projects are now able to run at a lower buffer setting, which makes navigating/editing/monitoring projects much easier, among other things. Element Control apps As we mentioned above, all of the control you have over Element can be found in the Element Control apps: The Mac app is essentially split in to two windows: Primary and Essentials. The thin Essential window can sit vertically or horizontally on your screen and I found it to be a great little way to visualize your inputs while allowing your DAW to hog most of the screen (as pictured above). When you need a more detailed look at your input console, the Primary window houses just about everything you need, including full control over all of your inputs/mic pre-amps, headphone outputs, and even a nice little Talkback system for those of us running a more serious multi-tracking session, etc. We also get 4 separate (headphone) mixes that can be routed to any of the available physical outputs. On the iOS side of things, you essentially get a mobile optimized version of the Essentials Window described above. Simply download the free app, and let it connect to the same Wi-Fi network the Mac your Element is connected to, and you’re ready to go. It worked immediately for me and was actually kind of a nice way to control the main room volume of my speakers and input levels for external synths/mics. Especially If I was tied behind a mic set-up or focused on a certain instrument not immediately in front of my monitor. I also had a chance to go hands-on with the Apogee Control remote. The small desktop controller provides a giant data entry knob to control your Element device including everything from input gain and master output level control/mute to phantom power, polarity and soft limit toggles (among other things). In other words, physical controls and a display for the interface similar to those Apogee usually has builds into its other interfaces, like with One, Duet, Quartet, and Ensemble. The buttons are nice and clicky and the knob and overall build quality feel as solid as the interface itself. It’s a nice option for those that require a physical control over their studio, and I for one think the $190 investment is worth it. Compare the price of the Element plus the Control remote to other products in Apogee’s lineup and you’re still looking at some of the best value for the number of ins and outs you’ll get. But with the solid desktop app and extremely convenient iOS counterpart, it is certainly not a required spend. Does Element support Logic’s new Audio Device controls? Yes, perfectly. While you can use the Essentials window quite nicely alongside the Workspace in Logic, Apogee supports Logic’s “Audio Device controls” feature that lets you control your interface’s most important input controls right from the Mixer in Logic (as pictured above). Sick. The Apogee Element Thunderbolt audio interfaces start at $595 for the 24, and go up from there at $895 for the 46 and $1,495 for the 88. So while these boxes certainly aren’t cheap, it is pretty amazing we are actually able to get a pair of Ensemble-level mic-pres/converters for just $600, nevermind 8 of them for $1,500 (+ loads of digital inputs). In fact, not only did my external analog synths and mics sound better on the way in, just about anything I played back through my speakers sounded better (than my current $400 USB interface) on the way out as well. Anyone looking to get album quality inputs for external gear and mics, without spending a fortune on a flagship option from one of the big boys, should definitely take a good look at the new Element series. My only real issue with the box is the front loaded connectors, but that’s likely less of an annoyance for the majority and only a preference for some that are racking the interface. However, if you don’t value the sound quality and the pedigree Apogee comes along with, there are cheaper Thunderbolt interfaces out there. If you’re just demoing or doing some casual podcasting/vlogging, Apogee’s Element series might make a little bit less dollars and sense than a single input, USB interface like the Apogee ONE or something even less expensive.

Amnesty International and other human rights groups also have alleged problems. Earlier this week, British broadcaster Sky News published an investigation that alleged continued problems in the cobalt supply chain. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link A boy carries a bag used to transport cobalt-laden dirt and rock at a mineral market outside Kolwezi, Congo. Photo: Michael Robinson Chavez / The Washington Post The Post connected this troubling trade to Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt Company, a Chinese firm that is the largest buyer of artisanal cobalt in Congo and whose minerals are used in Apple products.Last year, Apple pledged to clean up its cobalt supply chain, but the technology giant said it wanted to avoid hurting the Congolese miners by cutting them off. Mining provides vital income for hundreds of thousands of people in what is one of the world’s poorest countries.Now, Apple says it has stopped — for now — buying cobalt from artisanal mines.”We have been working with Huayou on a program that will verify individual artisanal mines, according to our standards,” Apple said in a statement, “and these mines will re-enter our supply chain when we are confident that the appropriate protections are in place.” Advertisement Cobalt is essential for the lithium-ion batteries found in laptops and smartphones, such as the iPhone.

While Apple has been quite secretive about the features of the upcoming tablet, several rumors have given us some idea of what the tablet might look like. Here are seven expected features of the upcoming tablet: Touch Bar: Apple is expected to introduce an OLED display across a range of products, including iPhones, iPads and Macs. One of MacBook Pro 2016’s distinctive features — the Touch Bar — is expected to come to the iPad range of tablets, starting with the iPad Pro 2. For the uninitiated, the Touch Bar acts as a virtual function row on keyboards and comes with features such as app shortcuts, emojis access and others. The Touch Bar is also customizable. Such a feature on the iPad Pro 2 could give users easy access to many features and make posting social media updates from the tablet much easier. Apple Pencil 2: The iPad Pro 2 might be accompanied by a new version of the company’s stylus, called the Apple Pencil 2. The new Stylus is expected to have a magnetic strip, which would let users attach the stylus to the tablet easily. It could also double up as a charging dock for the stylus, according to some rumors. A10X Chipset, Improved memory: The iPad Pro 2 is expected to feature a new A10X chipset — an improvement over the A10 one found in the previous version of the tablet. According to leaked benchmark test from October 2016, the A10X scored a 4236 in single-core and 6588 in multi-core tests on Geekbench.  In comparison, the A10 scored 3490 in single core tests and 5580 in multicore tests on Geekbench. In addition to this, the device is expected to have 4 or 6GB RAM and 64, 128 and 256GB variants. 12-megapixel rear camera: The iPad Pro 2 is expected to feature a 12-megapixel rear camera and a 5-megapixel front-camera, which would be a big update over the previous iteration of the device, which featured an 8-megapixel rear camera and a 1.2-megapixel front camera. The company may also endow the tablet with Live Photos and 4K video recording capability. True Tone Display: Apple may endow the 12.9-inch iPad Pro 2 with the True Tone display. The feature, which automatically adjusts the color and brightness of the tablet to match its environment, is currently available only on the 9.7-inch version of the current iPad Pro. 3.5mm audio jack: Apple might have ditched the 3.5mm audio jack on its iPhones, but the company is expected to retain it on the iPad Pro 2.  iOS 10.3: The new tablet is expected to either come with iOS 10.3 at the time of its launch or it will get it later, as soon as it is launched at WWDC 2017. The device is expected to be launched either in March or April at a dedicated event before WWDC. It is expected to be priced similar to its previous version — the 12.9-inch model could be priced at $799 and the 9.7-inch model could cost $599.

"Following" : "Follow"}} March 05, 2017 11:47am   Comments Share: Related BA President Trump Plans To Spend $54 Billion More On Defense Video: The Trump Tweet Indicator Valuation Dashboard: Industrials - Update (Seeking Alpha) On CNBC's Options Action, Carter Worth spoke about technical warning signs in Boeing Co (NYSE: BA). He thinks it's overbought, because it has significantly outperformed the market and the sector, which hasn't been the case in the past. Worth added that the stock is also trading significantly above its 150-day moving average, which has happened only four times in its history. Every time it has been this high above the 150-day moving average, the stock pulled back. Worth thinks it's going to trade lower again and he would sell the stock. Mike Khouw believes Boeing could have some fundamental problems, too. He explained that deliveries of Boeing 777 are going to slow down and there is also more competition in smaller airplanes segment. To make a bearish bet, Khouw wants to sell the April 180/190 call spread for a total credit of $4.30. The trade starts to lose money above $184.30 or 1.16 percent above the current market price. If Boeing Co trades below $180 at the April expiration, Khouw is going to collect $4.30, which is his maximal profit.

No suicide note, never answered the “Hello, Love!” as he walked up the stairs to his childhood bedroom. She told the police and paramedics that she just heard a ‘dull, heavy thud’ and found him laying upon the floor, still clutching the crossbow in one hand. It had actually snapped his wrist with the awkwardness of the fall. They removed the bolt from his head but he was in a coma for weeks, touch and go it was, but he made it. The after-effects were similar to a stroke, his right arm now dangles almost useless. Nearly eighteen years old and once a promising guitarist. He never told anybody ‘Why?’ just recovered and got on with life. That was twenty-five years ago, I saw him in a pub up Gorseinon last Saturday playing in a punk band. He can’t pluck or strum but the noises he gets out of that instrument by banging on it are incredible. I was right up the front going psycho and punched a ceiling tile in half out of love, respect and enthusiasm for him. Everyone gets low, we’ve all been there but a ‘Fighter’ always comes back Stronger. Paul Tristram is a Welsh writer who has poems, short stories, sketches and photography published in many publications around the world. He yearns to tattoo porcelain bridesmaids instead of digging empty graves for innocence at midnight; this too may pass, yet. Buy his books Scribblings Of A Madman (Lit Fest Press); Poetry From The Nearest Barstool; and a split poetry book The Raven And The Vagabond Heart with Bethany W Pope.

Companies with the best reputations, such as Amazon, Apple, Google and Tesla, often benefit significantly from word of mouth about the quality of their products. With strong sales and healthy profits, these companies can spend more on customer service, product quality and employee satisfaction, creating a positive feedback loop that can boost reputation in the long term. The Harris Poll Reputation Quotient measures public opinion on the nation’s most recognizable companies. Respondents were asked to rate companies based on six components: emotional appeal, products and services, vision and leadership, workplace environment, social responsibility, and financial performance. 24/7 Wall St. recently reviewed the companies with the highest and lowest reputation quotients. The reputation of e-commerce giant Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) remains the best among the nation’s 100 most recognizable companies: 1. Amazon.com > 2017 reputation score: 86.27 > 2016 reputation score: 83.96 > Industry: Internet retail > CEO: Jeff Bezos Of the six dimensions of corporate reputation, Amazon outshines all other companies in financial performance, vision and leadership, products and services, and emotional appeal. One reason behind Amazon’s widespread emotional appeal may be the company’s customer service. For as long as ACSI has ranked Amazon, the company has had one of the highest customer satisfaction scores of any U.S. business. The company’s innovations in online retail have also likely contributed to its great reputation. Between 1-click ordering, Amazon Prime, and various experimental redesigns of the traditional brick-and-mortar store concept, the company has been behind some of the boldest innovations in retail in recent years. Amazon Studios also made history recently by winning three Academy Awards at this year’s Oscars — a first for online streaming studios. Grocery store operator Wegmans was a close second on the list. Others in the top 10 included Apple and Google. Furthermore, Seattle is one of the U.S. cities with the most high-tech jobs, due in part to Amazon being headquartered there. In another recent 24/7 Wall St. analysis, Amazon was one of the most innovative companies. To determine America’s most and least reputable companies, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed reputation scores among the nation’s 100 most recognizable companies from the 2017 Harris Poll Reputation Quotient (RQ), produced by Harris Interactive. In addition, we considered company consumer satisfaction scores from the American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI) and company information from SEC filings. For the full methodology and to see the other companies with the best and worst reputations, see the complete 24/7 Wall St. analysis.

(NASDAQ: AAPL) posted a new 52-week high last Wednesday and the stock gained about 2.3% to close the week at $139.78. Apple stock has gained nearly 21% for the year to date and remains the Dow Jones Industrial Average’s best performing stock this year. There was more speculation last week about the new features that will be available on the next generation iPhone, dubbed the “iPhone 8.” Two of the new phone’s most talked about features — a curved display and wireless charging “at a distance,” — are not likely to be ready for this generation. Fingerprint scanning, which eliminates the need for a home button, is still in the plan as is an all-glass display. After a report that Apple would change the Lightning connector port to a USB-C port, a respected analyst said it wouldn’t happen. Apple is also expected to announce a new, cheaper 9.7-inch iPad later this month, rumored to be priced at $299. Apple’s market cap is now over $733 billion, a gain of $17 billion in just one week and $22 billion in the past two weeks. Between last May, when the stock dropped to a 52-week low, and last week, the shares have added more than 54%. The DJIA is up about 19% in the same period and the Nasdaq Composite is up about 24%. Apple shares closed at $139.78 on Friday in a 52-week range of $89.47 to $140.28. The consensus 12-month price target is $143.50 in a price target range of $102 to $185 per share.

Not actual driverless Nissan Leaf. +1 Tweet Share Share Stumble Pin Driverless cars are piquing the interests of just about every car manufacturer on the market, including the Nissan Motor Company. The company launched some testing of a modified Nissan Leaf on the streets of London, England. The week-long trial took the Nissan Leaf through what Nissan calls “a complex route” that included stop signs, dual carriageways, pedestrian crossings, and parking. The testing is expected to last for about a week and Nissan says there have been zero collisions and only a few instances where the driver had to take control of the vehicle to prevent an accident. Nissan has gotten permission to conduct these tests from Transport for London as well as the City of London Police. Transport for London is the governing body that oversees the transportation infrastructure of London so this is all being done with government cooperation. This marks a first for a driverless car to be tested in this way on public thoroughfares in London. “We believe that zero-emission vehicles are the ultimate solution for delivering a smarter, more sustainable future,” said Stuart Jackson from Nissan Europe. “We also believe that autonomous drive technologies will revolutionise the future of mobility, providing more safety, convenience and driving pleasure for everyone.” Nissan is shooting for getting the driverless Nissan Leaf (or whatever car they choose or build for the project) ready to be used at the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo, Japan. Driverless car technology is being heavily researched by not only major car companies but tech companies like Google and Apple have jumped in as well. While the technology is still in its infancy there is obviously a consensus among those with deep pockets that it’s worth investing in. It will be interesting to see where Nissan’s project ends up in 2020 and how the rest of the field will look as well. What do you think of Nissan’s London testing of the driverless Nissan Leaf?

Andrew Williams5 March 2017Laptops Pocket-lint 3.5 stars from £1,099 For Great screen, really lightweight, good-looking design Against Poor trackpad, just shy of all-day battery life, expensive Facebook Twitter Pintrest LinkedIn Google+ Mail Comment Where Apple goes, others follow. The Asus ZenBook 3 is this effect in action, taking the much-loved ZenBook design, removing most of the ports and squashing down the keyboard. Not all of the design changes work that well, but this little laptop is at least incredibly light. And not ridiculously expensive either, for something this striking. The Asus ZenBook 3 starts at £1,099 and jumps to £1,499 if you need 16GB RAM, a 512GB SSD and a Core i7 CPU. Is the ZenBook worth it or is it a step behind its other Windows competitors? Asus ZenBook 3 review: Design Aluminium shell, 12mm thick 910g weight (official) Single USB-C for connection and charging The best way to understand what's special about the Asus ZenBook 3 is to pick it up. This laptop is very light – just 904g according to our scales. Pocket-lint Given it's large enough to work on all day without getting wrist cramp, that's a big win. The ZenBook 3 is also extremely thin, at just 12mm thick. Carrying this laptop around is such a breeze, it feels like it might float if you drop the thing. Pro tip: it won't. The whole laptop shell is made of aluminium, and our review sample has a light golden finish. It's a looker, and also comes in a dark blue finish. Like other ZenBooks, there's a texture of concentric circles brushed into the lid. Asus doesn't want this to look like "just another" Ultrabook, but the design is also less Marmite-like than the HP Spectre, which looks like it's longing for the catwalk. The ZenBook is similar to the 12-inch MacBook in this sense. It also has similarly limited connectivity: with just one USB-C port (which is also used to charge) and a 3.5mm headphone jack. Pocket-lint There are no full-size USB ports and no memory card slot. If you don't use camera and don't like to plug-in a mouse, maybe it's not a big deal. But it would be for us. You can of course buy an adapter, but as there's just one socket it's blocked while charging anyway. Asus ZenBook 3 review: Keyboard and trackpad Fingerprint scanner embedded into trackpad Shallow keys with backlight Textured glass pad surface What you get in exchange is a little fingerprint scanner built into the trackpad. This is used by a Windows 10 feature called Hello, letting you login with a finger rather than a password. It's a neat idea, but we've already been spoiled by the many fantastic smartphone finger scanners, and this one just isn't as fast or reliable. Pocket-lint The other MacBook-ification element of the Asus ZenBook 3 is the keyboard. It's shallower than most, although thankfully not quite as wafer-thin as the 12-inch MacBook's. We still prefer a little more depth to our laptop keyboards, although we probably type away more than some of you. The ZenBook 3 keyboard has a light feel, and while it tries to fit some resistance into its shallow action, the tactile feedback of pressing a button isn't quite clear enough. It does have a great backlight, though, which can be set to three brightness levels. It needn't be too glaring if, for some reason, you need to work in a pitch-black room. Late-night horror gaming maybe? After a day or two, we got used to the keyboard. The trackpad is a different case, though. It has a top-quality glassy surface, and is of a decent size given the Asus ZenBook 3 is a diminutive little thing. But the clicker is bad. You don't feel the click as you press down, but as you lift your finger up. It feels odd; kind of spongy. Pocket-lint The trackpad is also tricky to press near the top, where pads with built-in buttons like this normally let you press any part to fire off a click. It's an annoying pad. Asus ZenBook 3 review: Display 12.5-inch Full HD IPS panel with 1000:1 contrast Non-touch display with glossy surface Powerful backlight Thankfully it's the one blunder in the Asus ZenBook 3's design. Its screen is great, for example. The surrounds are slim - little space is wasted - the colour really pops and contrast is very good. We'd rather watch a film on a big TV, but unless you have a great one it might actually look better on the ZenBook. You can also tweak the display a bit, too, by using an app called Splendid. Asus bungs this into its phones and tablets, where it lets you switch to an eye-strain-reducing ultra-warm mode, a cooler "vivid" one, or pick the colour temperature of your choice with a slider. It's not pro-grade control like we saw in the Dell XPS 15, but is nice to have. Pocket-lint As ZenBooks go, this is one of the finer examples we've seen, although it's not the sharpest. Full HD resolution looks good from the sort of distance you'll actually use the laptop from, but get closer and you can see those pixels without squinting. With 2017 laptop prices considered, though, a lot of £1,000-ish laptops have 1080p screens rather than QHD or 4K ones. As much as we like the colour and contrast, it might actually be the ZenBook 3's fab brightness that's the most useful screen element. A glassy top layer makes the display reflective, but the backlight has the intensity to deal with bright days working outdoors. If the weather was better, we might be typing every review outside on the ZenBook. It won't replace a tablet, though. There's no touchscreen, and the hinge doesn't have the kind of flexibility of a hybrid either. These aren't really compromises, but choices made by Asus. For all its lightness and adoption of some very recent design trends, the ZenBook 3 is a "proper laptop" first. Asus ZenBook 3 review: Performance Intel Core i5 and i7 U-series CPU options Up to 512GB SSD Intel HD 620 GPU - no discrete graphics card options The core spec is the best proof of this. Rather than using an ultra-low power chipset, the ZenBook 3 has an Intel Core i7-7500U. It's a dual-core CPU rather than a quad-core desktop-replacer, but is just about the most powerful CPU you could fit into a laptop this slim right now. Pocket-lint It's very fast for normal day-to-day tasks, thanks also to the pep of the 512GB SSD in our review model. It can write data at over 1400MB/s - speedy, right? That said, we expect the lower-end version of the ZenBook 3, which has a Core i5 CPU, will feel similar for light duties. This i7 version has a higher clock speed, a faster Turbo mode and a smidge more power in its GPU, the Intel HD 620. You get good productivity power, and we'd happily edit giant photos on this machine (well, after getting annoyed at the lack of SD memory card slot). But can it play games? Sort of. It has more gaming power than a 12-inch MacBook, and there are loads more games for Windows than Mac OS too, but it's not ideal. New top-tier titles are a bust so we tried Skyrim instead. Without the AC adapter plugged-in, you can comfortably play the game at "low" settings, 1080p resolution. Anything higher is a chug-fest. Plug in the power supply and you can creep up to "medium" settings without ruining the fun. In other words, it can hack PS3-grade games if you fiddle about with the settings, but not PS4-grade ones. Pocket-lint Put under pressure for a few minutes, the ZenBook 3 starts giving out an obvious whir as the fans ramp up to deal with the heat, but it's a fairly innocuous noise – not as pervasive as the Lenovo Yoga Book 910. That's the worry with ultra-slim laptops: using fans with tiny diameters can mean they sound like a swarm of wasps. Asus ZenBook 3 review: Battery life and speakers Charged over USB-C 7 hours battery life with normal use Dual speakers sit above the keyboard The other worry is that the battery life will have been sacrificed for the sake of a few grams, or a millimetre of thickness. You'll get much better stamina out of the Dell XPS 13, but the ZenBook 3's stamina isn't too bad. Pocket-lint Given light tasks, like our daily use of browsing and writing, it'll last almost dead on seven hours. That's a way below Asus's claim of up to nine hours' use, and isn't quite enough to get us through a full day's work. If you spend half your time skipping between meetings rather than staring into an LCD screen, maybe you'll have more luck. To end on a high note, the Asus ZenBook 3's speakers are surprisingly good given how thin this laptop is. There's a hint of bass, good treble clarity and enough volume to compete with the fan noise. A slightly affected edge to the sound tells us there's probably some clever software in the background designed to increased loudness. Verdict The Asus ZenBook 3 is one of the slimmest, lightest, most like-a-MacBook-but-not-a-MacBook Windows laptops you'll find. Its highlights, other than its extreme portability, are its strong screen and use of proper laptop processors rather ones that seem designed to run off watch batteries. Parts of the concept are great, but the practical realities of using the laptop day-to-day are less impressive. The trackpad is the worst part, given its irritatingly spongy feel, while the fingerprint scanner isn't that effective. Add the single port limitation and high price considering what the competition offer and there's room for improvement – despite the striking looks and apparent positives. Alternatives to consider… Pocket-lint Apple MacBook (12-inch) The inspiration for some of the choices made in the ZenBook 3, the 12-inch MacBook has a very shallow keyboard and a single USB-C port. However, its trackpad is far better than Asus's. It's a less powerful laptop, as it uses Intel's M-series processors rather than U-series ones (but that means less noise). Spec-for-spec, the MacBook is significantly more expensive, but less annoying to use day-to-day. Read the full review: MacBook (2016) review: Is port-free still the future? Pocket-lint Dell XPS 13 Dell hasn't subscribed to the Apple way of doing things in the way Asus has. The Dell XPS 13 is a little heavier and thicker than the ZenBook, but gets you some serious benefits in the deal. Its battery life is a lot better for light tasks and the keyboard is nicer. This laptop has a slightly bigger screen too, although thanks to Dell's InfinityEdge screen tech, its footprint is only a few millimetres wider.

It’s put smack in the middle of the screen, overlaying everything and making watching videos or playing games more of an annoyance than anything. There has been a truck load of jailbreak tweaks released in the past that aimed to fix this issue by relocating the volume HUD to the top of the screen, and a new free release called ByeByeHUD by midkin joins that ever-expanding list. Once installed, ByeByeHUD essentially relocates the volume HUD to the top of the screen, just like many jailbreak tweaks before it. Here, it’s out of the way and doesn’t hinder your access to the screen to watch videos and/or play games. ByeByeHUD includes many themes you can pick from, which is a feature normally only seen in paid releases: In order from left to right in the screenshot examples above, you can see: Minimal view: a simple volume percentage in the signal region Bar view: a simple volume bar view overlaying the Status Bar Slider view: a full-size slider overlaying the entire Status Bar region For minimalists, the first view (minimal) is the way to go, and in my opinion, is the best-looking option out of all three. I’m also keen on the slider view, which maintains a relatively clean look and feel. The bar view styling looks similar to that of a jailbreak tweak called SmartVolumeControl, which the developer actually credits in the Cydia depiction. ByeByeHUD is considered a “lite” version of this paid tweak. To change the tweak to match your personal tastes, ByeByeHUD puts a preferences pane in the Settings app where you can toggle the tweak on or off on demand, as well as pick and choose the theme you wish to use: If you’re interested in trying ByeByeHUD, you can download it for free from Cydia’s BigBoss repository. The tweak works on jailbroken iOS 8, 9, and 10 devices. Related: How to adjust the bass response of your iPhone or iPad headphones Do you think ByeByeHUD is an improvement over the stock volume HUD?

Want uninterrupted access to TheMercury.com on your computer, smartphone and tablet? We have many subscription options to fit your needs. See my options While Fake Patty’s Day creates plenty of problems for local police, attendees leave behind a trail of green in the Little Apple The event has grown from a single day drawing mostly K-State students to a weekend bacchanalia attracting thousands from around the region. Started after the turn of the century, it exploded in 2010 and has led to a debate about the fiscal and social cost to the public ever since. Riley County Police Department director Brad Schoen calls the event, which allegedly started so students could celebrate St. Patrick’s Day in Manhattan, “a celebration of making bad decisions.” While city officials and police have lamented the cost of the drunk fest, they have, at times, appeared unwilling to acknowledge its economic benefits. Hotels in Manhattan are filling up quickly for the March 11 event and local restaurants see an uptick in business over the weekend. The Irish-themed holiday normally falls when students are on spring break. This year, the real holiday is Friday, March 17, the last day of classes at K-State before the break. Lyle Butler, president of the Manhattan Area Chamber of Commerce, said the event definitely has an positive economic effect on the city. The problem in determining that effect is it lacks an official sponsor. “For events like Country Stampede or football games, there are people we can go to get specific information that can help us determine economic impact,” Butler said. Without an official organization or sponsors the chamber is left with only anecdotal information such as hotel bookings. COSTS, FINES, FEES Schoen told the Riley County Law Enforcement Agency Board last month that 2017’s Fake Patty’s Day will cost the department $50,000 to $60,000, mostly in overtime expenses. “That cost is only a part of the puzzle and doesn’t include fire and emergency management, so everybody takes a hit,” he said. But the RCPD also writes plenty of tickets for things like parking violations, possession of an open alcohol container in public and other infractions, that generates money from fines, fees and court costs for the city. In 2016, police issued 728 citations over a 35hour period encompassing Fake Patty’s Day. That’s about 6.4 percent of the roughly 11,400 citations processed in Manhattan Municipal Court last year. The total revenue from citations for last year’s event, as of March 1, 2017, was $126,420.99, or 7.4 percent of the court’s total revenue in 2016. Another $18,000 is outstanding from unpaid citations. RCPD spent a little over $42,000 on nearly 900 hours of overtime for Fake Patty’s Day in 2016 for officers, jailers, dispatchers and clerical workers. Schoen said in a typical weekend officers work about 10 to 12 hours of overtime. Weekends with major cases have had up to 120 hours of overtime, but that is a rarity, Schoen said. RCPD also paid almost $4,000 for officer support from the Junction City Police Department, gasoline for utility vehicles, wireless communication equipment and setting up a command post in City Park. The city funds 80 percent of RCPD’s budget, with Riley County picking up the rest. So Manhattan taxpayers are on the hook for about $37,000 of those expenses. Possession of an open alcohol container in public was the most common offense in 2016, with 289 citations issued. Police issued 81 citations for minors in possession of alcohol and 12 citations for driving under the in- fluence of alcohol. If you subtract the fees assessed — about $45,000 — to pay the cost of operating the municipal court, the city took in a little over $81,000 from citations. That includes parking violations, which don’t have court costs. Those accounted for almost 30 percent of all citations issued in 2016. Schoen noted an increase in drug use associated with the partying in past years. Marijuana citations increased to 18 in 2016, up from 14 the year before. “When you bring that many people into Manhattan for the express purpose of partying you are going to see more drug activity,” RCPD Capt. Josh Kyle said at the February law board meeting. OUTSIDE HELP In a tweet two weeks ago, the department said more than a dozen agencies will aid RCPD during Fake Patty’s Day. “We have some reciprocal relationships with law enforcement agencies in other communities,” Schoen said, noting the RCPD doen’t pay outright for all the assistance, but area taxpayers do pick up the tab when RCPD officers return the favor. Schoen said the event affects the entire department, even if the attendance is off. “Pretty much nobody gets time off that weekend,” he said. “If the weather is bad all day, the activity might be low but we’ve already got all these people scheduled and committed. You can’t just say, ‘Nevermind guys.’” BOOMTOWN Linda Mays, executive director of the Aggieville Business Association, said the event provides an economic boost for many business in the district. “It brings in a lot of money for lots of businesses,” she said. Bar workers want to work that day for the tips, Mays said. But, the weekend of revelry isn’t a boon to all Aggieville businesses. In past years businesses, like Shaggieville and On the Wildside, that don’t serve alcohol close for the day. In order to help those retailers, Mays said the association received a city permit to allow retailers to hold sidewalk sales at this year’s event. The economic impact also spills outside of Aggieville. And some educated guesswork can suss out how much the city gets in taxes from the event. At least 12 Manhattan hotels showed no rooms available on March 11 in a TripAdvisor search Friday. Several other hotels had only a few spaces available with the cheapest room checking in at $66. A similar search for hotel rooms on March 4, which featured home games for K-State’s men’s basketball and baseball teams, showed only two soldout hotels. The cheapest room was $46. Manhattan’s sales tax is 8.75 percent, of which 6.5 percent goes to the state. Riley County and the city each get 1 percentage point of every dollar spend, and another 0.25 percent goes to pay off city debt on socalled “quality of life” projects. The rate is 9.25 percent in the Fourth Street redevelopment area and a restaurant district on McCall Road. In addition to the normal sales tax, the city levies an additional 6 percent “bed tax” on hotel rooms and keeps virtually all of the money, which it uses the cash to promote the city, among other things. There are nearly 1,400 hotel rooms in Manhattan. The full ones on March 11 account for about 850 rooms. It’s tough to say how many are directly related to Fake Patty’s Day, but that number is significant. If 600 rooms are booked for the event at an average of $100 per night, that’s $60,000 in revenue for area hotels, $3,600 in bed tax money to the city and $600 each for the city and county in sales tax, not counting the special taxing districts or the special sales tax in the city. There’s additional sales tax collected on things like plastic cups, meals and commemorative T-shirts. The amount collected on any given weekend isn’t publicly available. Attendance estimates have varied from 6,000 to 10,000 over the years, but let’s say in an average of 8,000 people show up and spend their money conservatively. If those celebrators each spend an average of $20 on non-alcohol items, that’s $160,000 in sales, generating $1,600 in tax to each the city and county. Liquor taxes can get a little hazy, but basically there’s an 8 percent tax on alcohol bought at retail outlets and a 10 percent tax on drinks in bars. It the 8,000 attendees each spend $25 — half at liquor stores and half at bars — for the event, that’s $100,000 at each, or $8,000 in tax at retailers and $10,000 at bars. Kansas keeps about 30 percent of that $18,000, the other $12,600 is sent to the city, which divvies it up in thirds among its general fund, special parks and recreation fund and the Special Alcohol Fund. For reference purposes, the city received $1.43 million in 2015 from alcohol taxes. The state also collects a “gallonage” tax on beer, wine and spirits from manufacturers, but it keeps nearly all of that money. In total, between citations minus court costs, and estimated sales, liquor and bed taxes, the city collects in the neighborhood of $105,000 from Fake Patty’s Day. It’s share of the police budget and the cost to staff the municipal court in 2016 was about $90,000. BOTTOM LINE From a dollars and cents perspective, the city comes out ahead by roughly $15,000. Is Fake Patty’s Day worth it? That’s a question for which there’s no objective answer.

The smartphone has been created by Google who is also the Android parent. There are many factors which helped Pixel gather such a large customer base and one of them is certainly its sleek design. Even though Pixel’s design looks impressive, Google has received some harsh criticism for designing it the same way iPhone 6 was designed. Google Pixel Copied iPhone 6’s Design Google has been producing smartphones for a long while now but Pixel is the first ever “Google-made” smartphone. All the other devices have been created in partnership with other tech manufacturers and branded under the Nexus name. Before Google decided to venture into the smartphone world by itself, it analyzed all that its competition was offering and decided to mimic their best features on Pixel. We think it’s pretty safe to say that Pixel is just an iPhone 6 with a glass back plate when it comes to design. What’s really intriguing though is that Apple has actually copied HTC One’s design when it created iPhone 6. This looks like we have a vicious circle on our hands. Even better, Google has actually copied another Apple feature. We are talking about the exterior antenna. A few years ago, Apple decided to implement an innovative antenna design on iPhone 4. The smartphone had its antenna spread out on the back panel, similar to the way Pixel has been designed. We should mention that when Apple first launched the iPhone that featured an exterior antenna, the company received some harsh criticism because of it. iPhone 4 users needed to be careful how they hold the device since if their hand covered the antenna, the device lost its signal strength. Apple was eventually forced to start giving out free bumper cases so that iPhone 4 owners would be happy. Nonetheless, rumor has it that Google is actually working on creating Pixel 2 right now. Maybe the new flagship smartphone will finally feature an exclusive design. Obviously the smartphone will feature the back plate piece of glass because it’s seen as Google’s trademark, but maybe it will ship with an innovative edge to edge display.

This will be the first do-over for the tablet since 2015. While Apple has been quite secretive about the features of the upcoming tablet, several rumors have given us some idea of what the tablet might look like. Popular Searches Exxon Mobil Corp XOM ▲ 82.83 +0.37 +0.45% DP Poland PLC DPP ▼ 52.50 -0.75 -1.41% Domino's Pizza Group PLC DPUKY ▲ 9.97 +1.02 +11.40% athenahealth Inc ATHN ▼ 116.76 -0.97 -0.82% Here are seven expected features of the upcoming tablet: Touch Bar: Apple is expected to introduce an OLED display across a range of products, including iPhones, iPads and Macs. One of MacBook Pro 2016’s distinctive features — the Touch Bar — is expected to come to the iPad range of tablets, starting with the iPad Pro 2. For the uninitiated, the Touch Bar acts as a virtual function row on keyboards and comes with features such as app shortcuts, emojis access and others. The Touch Bar is also customizable. Such a feature on the iPad Pro 2 could give users easy access to many features and make posting social media updates from the tablet much easier. Apple Pencil 2: The iPad Pro 2 might be accompanied by a new version of the company’s stylus, called the Apple Pencil 2. The new Stylus is expected to have a magnetic strip, which would let users attach the stylus to the tablet easily. It could also double up as a charging dock for the stylus, according to some rumors. A10X Chipset, Improved memory: The iPad Pro 2 is expected to feature a new A10X chipset — an improvement over the A10 one found in the previous version of the tablet. According to leaked benchmark test from October 2016, the A10X scored a 4236 in single-core and 6588 in multi-core tests on Geekbench.  In comparison, the A10 scored 3490 in single core tests and 5580 in multicore tests on Geekbench. In addition to this, the device is expected to have 4 or 6GB RAM and 64, 128 and 256GB variants. 12-megapixel rear camera: The iPad Pro 2 is expected to feature a 12-megapixel rear camera and a 5-megapixel front-camera, which would be a big update over the previous iteration of the device, which featured an 8-megapixel rear camera and a 1.2-megapixel front camera. The company may also endow the tablet with Live Photos and 4K video recording capability. True Tone Display: Apple may endow the 12.9-inch iPad Pro 2 with the True Tone display. The feature, which automatically adjusts the color and brightness of the tablet to match its environment, is currently available only on the 9.7-inch version of the current iPad Pro. 3.5mm audio jack: Apple might have ditched the 3.5mm audio jack on its iPhones, but the company is expected to retain it on the iPad Pro 2. iOS 10.3: The new tablet is expected to either come with iOS 10.3 at the time of its launch or it will get it later, as soon as it is launched at WWDC 2017.

It is expected to be priced similar to its previous version — the 12.9-inch model could be priced at $799 and the 9.7-inch model could cost $599.

I still interact with Dropbox on the web once a week to produce the 9to5Mac Happy Hour podcast, but iCloud Drive could totally replace Dropbox for me with a few additional features… Sony A6500 My iCloud Drive usage surged over the last few months for two reasons. First, I have a great experience with iCloud Photo Library syncing my photos and videos across my devices. Storing 16,655 images and 1,459 videos takes up 212.78GB of iCloud storage for me so I’m just over the 200GB for $2.99/month plan. The next plan available is 1TB for $9.99 which I gladly pay to continue the experience, and that leaves a lot of free iCloud storage for other purposes. Enter macOS Sierra last fall. Apple enabled Documents and Desktop syncing through iCloud Drive between multiple Macs, iPhones, and iPads. I have the available iCloud storage to go all in, so I have been since macOS Sierra was released. I’m not doing the two Mac setup anymore, but I do enjoy having access to files from my Mac Desktop and Documents folders when using my iPhone and iPad. But iCloud Drive still lacks a few important features that make Dropbox more capable. First is cross-platform compatibility. Dropbox has clients on iOS, macOS, Android, Windows, and the web, but iCloud Drive sticks to iOS, Windows, and the web. Web access does mean you can find your files on other platforms, however, and I’m personally fine with iOS integration alone. iCloud storage does integrate with built-in apps and services like Photos and iOS Backup that don’t work with Dropbox, but Dropbox does a better job on iOS at playing back media files by streaming before completely downloading. Apple could catch up here, but these differences are also minor for me. It’s sharing large files with other people where I fall back to Dropbox still. It’s not a storage constraint. I pay for and have the capacity available. It’s just not as easy yet. You can email someone a large attachment and rely on iCloud Drive for delivery, but Dropbox is more straightforward with how it handles sharing. Simply upload your file to your Dropbox storage, then share a URL with someone else. That person can download the file even if they don’t use Dropbox. This is how Benjamin sends me his local audio recording for the Happy Hour podcast every week. His file goes to Dropbox, he sends me a URL, I download the file, then he eventually deletes it. iCloud Drive is available on the web through iCloud.com, but there’s no concept of sharing files with a URL like there is with Dropbox. Selfishly, I don’t install Dropbox on my Mac anymore at all. If I need to share a file with someone using a URL, I go to the web portal to upload the file and create the link. But if I did keep Dropbox installed on my Mac, Benjamin and I could use a shared Dropbox folder where he could put his audio file from his Mac. I could access it when needed, then delete it for both of us when done. But I just don’t want Dropbox installed on my Mac anymore. I also happen to be paying for serious iCloud storage anyway, so doing more with it and not Dropbox would be better. iCloud Drive could add shared folders and URL sharing (email just really isn’t the way I want to share) and totally replace Dropbox in my life. Fingers crossed for this feature in iOS 11 and macOS 10.13 later this year.

Zac Hall - Mar. 3rd 2017 8:41 am PT @apollozac iPhone 8 poll View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Imagine this possibility: Apple holds an iPhone event in September, unveils iterative iPhone 7s and 7s Plus upgrades shipping in 2-3 weeks, and a radically different iPhone 8 or iPhone Pro that won’t ship for another 4-6 weeks. Even when the totally new iPhone does ship, supply is extremely constrained and only the very first pre-orders get stock before the end of the year. Would you be willing to wait it out for the dramatically different iPhone? Sony A6500 The possibility isn’t completely unlikely. New iPhones are always supply constrained, especially new finishes, and there’s already evidence that the OLED display models will be supply constrained before factoring demand. Pair today’s Digitimes report that OLED iPhone production won’t start until September with earlier reports that Apple is actually starting next-generation iPhone production sooner this year and you can guess what might happen. The OLED iPhone is expected to have a bezel-less design, Touch ID possibly integrated in the display, wireless charging, a 3D sensing front camera, and an overall larger display area in a smaller footprint. The OLED iPhone is expected to be an all-new model joining new versions of the 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch iPhones which will not look different. If the radically new iPhone ships later and faces supply constraints, would you be willing to wait before upgrading?

Google’s flagship device will face competition from the likes of Samsung’s Galaxy S8, Apple’s iPhone 8 and LG’s G6. But the device’s main rival in the market will definitely be the Galaxy S8. Both companies will have a lot to prove with their devices. While the Galaxy S8 is Samsun's first major device post the Galaxy Note 7 scandal, the Pixel 2 — as it is expected to be called — is Google’s chance to build on the initial success of the Pixel device. It also presents a chance for Google to improve on the hardware and software flaws that the device suffered from despite its initial success. Let’s see how the two devices stack up against each other in terms of specs: Performance Both the Google Pixel 2 and the Samsung Galaxy S8 are expected to come with a 10nm technology based Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor. While Samsung has the entire supply of the processor reserved for the S8, which is expected to launch in March or April, the Google Pixel 2 is expected to release in October 2017, there is a fair chance that the company gets its hands on the processor. Display The Samsung Galaxy S8 is expected to come in 5-inch and 6-inch models, while Pixel series 2 is also expected to have a similar lineup. While the edge-to-edge display for the Samsung Galaxy S8 is mostly confirmed, according to Pocket Lint, if Google wants to compete with the major flagships in the market, it will have to endow its Pixel 2 device with one. While Samsung is expected to go for a display-embedded fingerprint sensor for the S8, Google is expected to continue with the rear-mounted one on the current Pixel device. Camera According to Sammobile, the Samsung Galaxy S8 is expected to come with a dual-camera setup comprising of a 12-megapixel camera sensor accompanied by a 13-megapixel one, which will help create a better depth of field in images. Google will have much to build on for its Google Pixel 2 handset since its current device has been rated as the best smartphone camera yet by DxO Mark. According to 9to5 Google, the company is currently developing a camera lens, which could have an improved low-light condition performance. In addition to this, both devices are also expected to have waterproof bodies. While Samsung already espouses the standard in its existing device – the Samsung Galaxy S7, Google is expected to endow its Pixel 2 device with either an IP67 or IP68 certified body, according to Trusted Reviews. While the Samsung Galaxy S8 is expected to have a price tag of $899, the Google Pixel 2 is expected to be launched later in October at $649.

But if your desk goals stop at functionality, you’re doing it wrong. The Flow Table Lamp doesn’t just illuminate, it invigorates, with a design that, contrary to its name, doesn’t evoke water so much as a maximally pared bonsai tree. A flat LED chip eliminates the need for bulky bulbs and keeps the profile sleek. Better still? You can adjust the lamp’s positioning like a crane, optimizing for lighting or aesthetics (or both). And while it’s never easy to sacrifice desk space, with a base that’s just 7.5 inches across, the Flow leaves plenty of room for laptops and tillandsias. Brilliant!

This will be the first do-over for the tablet since 2015. While Apple has been quite secretive about the features of the upcoming tablet, several rumors have given us some idea of what the tablet might look like. Here are seven expected features of the upcoming tablet: Touch Bar: Apple is expected to introduce an OLED display across a range of products, including iPhones, iPads and Macs. One of MacBook Pro 2016’s distinctive features — the Touch Bar — is expected to come to the iPad range of tablets, starting with the iPad Pro 2. For the uninitiated, the Touch Bar acts as a virtual function row on keyboards and comes with features such as app shortcuts, emojis access and others. The Touch Bar is also customizable. Such a feature on the iPad Pro 2 could give users easy access to many features and make posting social media updates from the tablet much easier. Apple Pencil 2: The iPad Pro 2 might be accompanied by a new version of the company’s stylus, called the Apple Pencil 2. The new Stylus is expected to have a magnetic strip, which would let users attach the stylus to the tablet easily. It could also double up as a charging dock for the stylus, according to some rumors. A10X Chipset, Improved memory: The iPad Pro 2 is expected to feature a new A10X chipset — an improvement over the A10 one found in the previous version of the tablet. According to leaked benchmark test from October 2016, the A10X scored a 4236 in single-core and 6588 in multi-core tests on Geekbench.  In comparison, the A10 scored 3490 in single core tests and 5580 in multicore tests on Geekbench. In addition to this, the device is expected to have 4 or 6GB RAM and 64, 128 and 256GB variants. 12-megapixel rear camera: The iPad Pro 2 is expected to feature a 12-megapixel rear camera and a 5-megapixel front-camera, which would be a big update over the previous iteration of the device, which featured an 8-megapixel rear camera and a 1.2-megapixel front camera. The company may also endow the tablet with Live Photos and 4K video recording capability. True Tone Display: Apple may endow the 12.9-inch iPad Pro 2 with the True Tone display. The feature, which automatically adjusts the color and brightness of the tablet to match its environment, is currently available only on the 9.7-inch version of the current iPad Pro. 3.5mm audio jack: Apple might have ditched the 3.5mm audio jack on its iPhones, but the company is expected to retain it on the iPad Pro 2.  iOS 10.3: The new tablet is expected to either come with iOS 10.3 at the time of its launch or it will get it later, as soon as it is launched at WWDC 2017. The device is expected to be launched either in March or April at a dedicated event before WWDC. It is expected to be priced similar to its previous version — the 12.9-inch model could be priced at $799 and the 9.7-inch model could cost $599.

While El Capitan comes with mostly the same look and feel as OS X Yosemite, the new version includes a lot of new features, both big and small, that prove that it’s a nice upgrade over the previous version. Plus, Apple claims users will get up to 2x faster speeds when switching between apps, so performance is a bit better this time around as well. In the past, I was running OS X Yosemite on my 2008 iMac for a few months, and performance was about what I expected with an older iMac like this. It’s pretty slow as far as opening apps is concerned, and even accessing the System Preferences can be a bit sluggish at the start. I added 4GB of memory to replace the 2GB that it came with, and performance increased a bit, although not by much. I reckon that once I replace the hard drive with a good solid-state drive, performance will see a big boost. However, until then, I need to get the best performance I can out of what I have, and with the promise of better performance in OS X El Capitan, I decided to update my iMac immediately to the new version. Here’s what you should know about OS X El Capitain on an older Mac. First of all, the cut-off point from which OS X El Capitan supports the iMac is mid-2007, and I’m just one or two refreshes from that point, so it’s a close one, but nonetheless, OS X El Capitan runs on my aging iMac. The good news is that OS X El Capitan installed perfectly on my iMac, although it did take way longer than it did on my 2013 MacBook Pro. That’s something to expect with an older Mac, so be sure to set aside plenty of time for your older machine to update to the latest version. Once it installed, I didn’t experience any major problems and the iMac handled the new version like a champ for the most part. The smooth installation alone was cause for celebration, as I was expecting at least a few hiccups during the process. Thankfully, it went the other way. As for performance over OS X Yosemite, I haven’t noticed a huge difference over the last few months that I’ve been running El Capitan, but I can certainly say that it’s not any slower. However, System Preferences does load a lot quicker than it did previously, and most apps open within a few seconds, so it’s definitely not a huge improvement over what it was, but it’s about the same, if not maybe a bit faster this time around. However, Spotlight Search is still pretty slow even though Apple put a lot of focus into making it faster and better. The features are pretty great, though, like being able to quickly pull up weather and sports scores, as well as use natural language to search for various things. Luckily, I haven’t come across any problems except for some issues I had with my Logitech mouse, although that’s not really an OS X problem, but rather an issue with Logitech’s software and its support for OS X El Capitan. I thought I fixed it with a re-installation of the software, but I’m still having some issues with it. Overall, I feel like OS X El Capitan is a great update for those running older Macs. If you have OS X Yosemite installed on an older machine, updating to El Capitan won’t hurt it at all, and it even might even increase performance a bit. However, you can always downgrade to OS X Yosemite if need be. However, I’d recommend upgrading your Mac if you can. Simply replacing the hard drive with a solid-state drive and adding more memory can do wonders for speeding up your older Mac, especially if you use it as a daily computer. You’ll notice the performance boost right away. 84 Responses 10/05/2015 Juan Diego Molineaux Reply Macbook Pro Mid 2012, 8GB RAM, 250GB SSD. Works flawless. 10/05/2015 Sabine Reply Macbook Pro 15″ Early 2011, 16GB RAM, 1TB SSD. Works flawless so far. It also seems to run a bit cooler. 10/20/2015 cferthorney Reply Thanks Sabine, I’m similar hardware (512SSD instead of 1TB). Feel more confident on upgrading now I’ve heard it hasn’t slowed down my hardware too much. Office 2016 aside, I can live without anything else that’s broken, and the 2016 issues seem to be more hit and miss now. 10/06/2015 Victor Rasquin Reply iMac 2007 – Flawless installation (more than 1 hr!) – OSX.11 gave my Mac a second youth. Everything is a lot snappier; apps are loading much quickier. I certainly recommend this upgrade! 10/14/2015 Marcel Reply Same here : iMac 2007 4 GB RAM. 1TB WD Black @7200 Works great, everythinh loading faster ( Yosemity before ); D3 and SC2 (c) wiht good perfomance, EyeTV (c) running smooth wo dropping pictures 10/06/2015 Junian Reply MacBook Pro 13″ Late 2013 , 8 GB RAM, 256 SSD. I recommend you to upgrade El Capitan ASAP. It’s more responsive than Yosemite. 10/07/2015 Brett Schulte Reply Having installed Yosemite on a dozen or so Macs since the public beta begam I don’t notice any difference in El Capitan vs. Yosemite in terms of performance. With that said, there are a lot of other improvements. My favorite is being able to hide bar at the top of the screen to really use all the screen real estate available. 10/08/2015 Ted Reply Tried installing el capitan on an early 2008 imac but it could not get past the login screen without crashing and auto restarting. 10/19/2015 Jay Reply My mid-2009 macbook pro keeps restarting and then going blank when I close it to put it on sleep mode. I have to force restart it every time I open it back up. I’m switching back to Yosemite… 12/10/2015 Yves Velazco Reply Did you ever resolve this issue? I have a 2009 iMac that recently run into the same problem. 10/19/2015 Floyd Reply Outlook crashing frequently. 11/01/2015 Jay Reply Anyone tried installing this on a mid-2008 imac? I’m still running 10.9.5 – never upgraded to Yosemite. 11/08/2015 keith Reply Early 2008 iMac that only had 1GB RAM until 11/2015 when I put in a new 2GB RAM card and upgraded to the minimum needed to get El Capitan. Download was extremely slow. Installation slow. Result: this is a totally new and wonderful iMac! Another 2GB RAM coming but it’s a beautiful thing! 07/04/2016 Dawn Ewald Reply so it works on an early 2008 iMac with only 2gb okay? Not extremely slow? 07/30/2016 Neil Reply I’m going to install on my IMAC early 2008 4GB ram and hopefully El Capitan will be ok and even better with 6GB ram upgrade 11/14/2015 banjoboy77 Reply I downloaded El Capitan on my 2008 imac a few weeks ago. I just got rid of it because my programs were all freezing and the machine was running slowly. Anyone else experience this? I just switched back to the previous operating system. 11/19/2015 Johannes Reply How did you switch back? Using the time machine or is it more complicated than that? As Jay says below ,one in favour , one against ,I want to be sure to be able to switch back!I never upgraded to Yosemite! 11/16/2015 Jay Reply So far, one ‘yes’ vote and one ‘no’ vote for upgrading to El Capitan on my 2008 iMac. I think I’ll keep my current OSx for now. 11/28/2015 jess84 Reply Has anyone downloaded El Capitan on iMac 2013 ? Thinking about downloading it but so far other than this site, I haven’t seen many positive reviews…. Figured I would give it a couple more weeks or atleast a month for Apple to iron out kinks… Right now i’m on Yosemite and it works pretty well…. 11/28/2015 lamthuyen Reply macbook pro 17 early 2008 8GB 500GB Drive, updated today, works great. 12/17/2015 Peter Reply Hi, I have a macbook pro 17″ as well with 8GB and 500GB storage. 2.53 GHz Intel Core i5 and running OS X 10.9.5 It’s probably similar to what you have. Do you recommend me upgrading to OS X El Capitan? Does it effect adobe CS6 or SuiteCase Fusion 4? Thanx 11/29/2015 Dustball Reply I have a older 2008 iMac 2.4 GHz intel core 2 duo, 4 GB 800 MHz DDR2 SDRAM with ATI Radeon HD 2400 XT 128 MB graphics. Since updating to OS X El Capitan, my iMac has regularly locked up on me, internet sites slower to upload, screens lock and have to close out safari and start over, once in a while, nothing works and have to hard reboot computer, sucks, wished I never updated to El Capitan. is my machine too old to run these new IOS platforms? what to do? 11/29/2015 dustball Reply how do you go back to Yosemite? not a computer geek here 12/15/2015 Cheon-Fong Liew (@liewcf) Reply Thanks for the article. Now I am confidence to update my iMac 2008 to the OS X El Capitan 02/01/2016 Sarah Reply I have just experienced my late 2008 macbook crashing after the el captain installation. i fear i have lost everything as i cannot start the laptop without it crashing on the start up. my macbook has been very reliable since 2009 which is when i bought it and never had a single issue. yosemite was installed prior to this. I’ve never had to keep a back up till now.. but too late. i think they should perhaps make it clear that el captain is a risk to older MacBooks. obv some of yours works and some doesn’t. its a 50/50. shame for those who risk losing their data. apple chat senior advisors were unable to help. they suggested recovery mode start ups etc. but nothing they could do or even explain why this happened. 02/19/2016 Hilli Reply Question: My iMac is a early 2008 model. Will El Capitan work on this? 02/21/2016 Izzy Reply iMac 2008 with El Capitan. Works like charm! 07/30/2016 Neil Reply Hi I have IMAB early 2008 with SSD upgrade and 4GB ram will El Capitan work on my machine without slowing down. Or would it be best to do 6GB ram upgrade ? 02/21/2016 Hilli Reply Thanks Izzy! Another silly question: How much ram would I need to have for the upgrade? 03/01/2016 Jenny Reply I also have an old macbookpro, 2008. I have had the memory increased and I am working on Lion, haven’t upgraded yet, but am concerned that if I do I could have problems. What do you recommend? 03/01/2016 Hilli Reply DO NOT upgrade Jenny. It screwed my iMac. Need to take it away to a iStore. 03/30/2016 Edwin Anthony Reply I think when apple set the minimum requirements, they purposely didn’t take into consideration the other software on the system. The obvious reason is to force customers to upgrade the hardware on their machines or buy a new Mac. They basically set the requirements way too low. In a sense, it is a play on words – that you need x amount of y in order to run it. Doesn’t mean that it will run as well as before, or that their own heavy-duty software might not crash or give problems. I personally have quite a lot of problems with my Logic Pro 9 even after upgrading to just Mavericks. I even heard that Logic 9 will not work well on their latest machines as Apple wants people to upgrade to 10 and pocket the money. I view these upgrades by Apple as no different from a virus. A virus borne of greed. It may work for some, but it is purposefully DESIGNED to not work for many. 03/05/2017 Kevin Reply I realize this is an older thread. Also have a 2008 mbpro, core2duo, etc. Thankfully I bought Carbon Copy Cloner and cloned the whole thing on an OWC external drive just before downloading Lion. For $30 it is genius and easy to do. Lion destroyed the functioning of macbook pro 4,1. It’s a really creepy thing for Apple to promote that for a core2duo machine. It’s like a trojan horse…or something. It was as if my mac got an advanced case of Lou Gehrig’s disease inside of 20min. Twenty minutes later I just wiped the whole machine and re-installed my 10.6 with Carbon Copy Cloner. Easy easy easy. Like I said, it’s genius software. It makes Time Machine look like torture. I had my mac back up and running in under 30 minutes. Now, two years later I still run Snow Leopard on that “old” mac. Musicians love Snow Leopard. It’s a shame how lowdown Apple has become with their update mania and just kicking their customers to the curb. That being said there is great talent at Apple. You have to stay aware. Never ever update without a plan if you are using pro-level software for production. Clone your system and pay very close attention before letting a case of update mania take your system down. 03/03/2016 Ken Reply Also, can I put SSD in my wife’s mid 2009 13″ Macbook Pro? 03/08/2016 Jonas Reply Yes it will work great. 03/03/2016 Ken Reply My first question seems to have disappeared. I want to know if I can put 16Gb RAM into a mid 2010 15″ Macbook Pro. Sabine mentioned above that she has 16Gb in an early 2011 Pro, but the Apple support site says 8Gb max in all listed Macbooks. 03/23/2016 Kari Reply I read the same info. as you on apple support, however, based on a little internet research, I opted to exceed the 8 Gb max for my early 2011 macbook pro. I too, installed 16 Gb (a few months ago) and it works like a charm – performance is dramatically better. I feel like I have a brand new computer for only $60. 03/08/2016 Jonas Reply MacBook Pro 2,4 core 2 duo 17” 114gb ssd 2gb of ram. It works great. Really fast. Amazing for a 9 years old mac. For office, net and e-mail a Very good machine. 03/21/2016 William Reply I think I have the same machine. Identified as mid/late 2007 model. So long ago, I can’ remember exacty when I purchased it. When you say “works great”, you do mean works great on El Capitan?? I’m trying to decide whether to update. I have 4gb RAM. 03/10/2016 Russell Armani Reply I have got late 2008 macbook pro and the install went great, most of the apps run very well. But the major problem is Apple Mail app. It is so laggy. That was the reason I wen back to Mountain Lion after installing Yosemite, which had the same problem. When El Capitan came out I hoped this problem was solved. It is better, but still not as snappy enough as mail in mountain lion, which is what I am on right now again – went back to ML, could not cope with slow mail app which I used all the time. Missing great Logic and Final Cut Pro on El Capitan, but mail drove me crazy, had no choice. I hope this is going to be fixed in next update. 03/17/2016 Easgs Reply will it work with the imac 4.1? https://support.apple.com/kb/SP35?locale=es_ES 03/20/2016 Debrasmoffitt Reply Hurrah…!m­­­­­­­­­y co-wor­­­­­­­­­ker’s m­­­­­­­­­om mak­­­­­­­­­es $86 /hr o­­­­­­­­­n th­­­­­­­­­e comp­­­­­­­­­uter .

Will it affect my Adobe Flash and Photoshop (both) CS6 programs at all? I have made a Time Machine backup, but will it be able to restore things if the upgrade goes awry? Needless to say I’m not a computer expert by any means. 03/26/2016 Bob Reply OS X El Capitan is working just fine on MacBook Pro (13-inch, Mid 2010), Processor: 2.4 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo, Memory: 8 GB 1067 DDR3, Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce 320M 256 MB, Storage: 250 GB. Started download before going to bed. Installation the next morning. Yeah, I was a little nervous, but everything seems to be running smoothly. 08/27/2016 Ryan Reply Hi Bob, I have a late-2011 model, 2.2 Ghz Intel i7, 4 GB 1333 MHz DDR3 with the AMD Radeon HD 6750M 512 MB graphics card. My machine was part of Apple’s repair program to replace the graphic card in 2015. It was crazy and got Apple to fix my MBP, all costs on them. With what happened, do you think it’s wise for me to upgrade to El Capitan? Heard of any stories similar to mine? 03/26/2016 Andrea Reply Super happy I installed El Capitan on my early 2011 MacBook Pro. Yosemite was making me want to throw my laptop off the balcony. So far, so good! I was so tired of how my MacBook was responding to Yosemite that I restored it to snow leopard to save myself some stress. Decided to try El Capitan and happy I upgraded. The install took a little bit longer than I thought, but my MacBook is working way better. Won’t be throwing it off the balcony anytime soon! 03/28/2016 Fin Reply Hello, I have a 15′ 2012 Macbook Pro. It still has 4gb or ram and the original slower 500gb HDD. Although I will be upgrading both the memory and ram in the next couple of months is it a good idea to upgrade to El Capitan now or should I wait as this will make my system sluggish with this configuration? Thanks in advance for any opinions you can offer! 04/03/2016 Ken Reply Early 2009 20″ iMac. Upgraded the RAM to 8GB and installed El Capitan. So far it runs great. Internet is really fast. Ram install was very easy. I was cautioned that it could be a disaster but so far it’s the opposite. I’m loving this iMac. Was running like crap on Mavericks with 2GB of RAM. Greatly improved. 04/07/2016 May Reply Since upgrading to El Capitan my iMac does not recognize my network 2008 iMac 04/15/2016 Rene B Reply Don’t do it! I have a 2007, upgraded the RAM to install El Capitan from Snow Leopard. Spinning wheel constantly, freezes up regularly during internet searches and have to power it off to get it working again. NEVER had to do that before. Very disappointed. 04/16/2016 Mathias Reply I have a mac mini and a macbook both mid 2001, upgraded on the mini to 12GB ram and macbook to 8GB ram (8GB is enough for my use) also upgraded in both to SSD. Upgrading a mac mini is a pita, was happy that it was booting after upgrade :))) Both are running smoothly with el Captain clean install. But still wonder if running mountain lion on my macbook would not speed up a bit and I do like the retro style :) 04/16/2016 Mathias Reply Sorry was both mid 2010, had a snow leopard cd/dvd and no performance gain at all with older os x versions. With an SSD, 6 or 8GB ram and an Intel Core 2 Duo or greater El Captain is actually faster. (so no retro,lol) It’s being a while using mac os x, mostly to slow compared to linux. (even windows) Had some fun time with my macbook and mini (didn’t use them for more than a year), upgraded them with way above amount ram specified by apple. Crucial SO-DIMM 1600/1333mhz works perfectly (adaptive) no need to buy expensive ram, they just work on mac like other laptop’s. That 5400rpm drive is very slow (probably cheaper for apple) change it with an SSD if you have a SATA interface. (128GB is cheap, use an external for more space) Just buy a good screwdriver set and you will get a new mac, just don’t fall into the marketing strategy of apple. (Steve Jobs is gone) Believe me, I spent on both devices around 200 euro and the mac mini on sale right now cost 550 euro with a slower cpu, 5400rpm drive and only 4GB. Upgrade is the solution, cheaper and better specifications/performance. 05/01/2016 Wei Reply I installed el cap on my 2007 macbook pro, and regretted it a few weeks later. Made the computer pretty glitchy, especially with going to sleep. Also tended to crash periodically. Restored to 10.6.8. 05/20/2016 Eugene Brown Reply I currently have a late 2007 imac (7,1) runs a 2.4GHZ core 2 duo proc, 4GB 667MHZ DDR2 ram, 800MHZ BUS, 320GB HD. I am currently running Snow Leopard 10.6.8. How high can I upgrade the OS version on this machine ? Will I be able to at least do Mountain Lion, or can I go all the way up to El Capitan ? Gene B. 08/05/2016 Futurist01 Reply I’m running a 2007 Macbook pro and was able to run mountain lion and currently Mavericks, just make sure you have enough internal storage available for system functions and it’s fine. I’m not sure though about El Capitan though. I’m worried it may slow it down. 08/30/2016 Eric Reply I have a mid 2007 iMac that I upgraded to 4GB Ram. I installed El Capitan today, and it is running SO MUCH faster than Snow Leopard was (10.6.8). This thing is like a brand new computer. 09/08/2016 Marco Reply Hi Eric I was just wondering wether El Capitan still works well one month later. Or if it stucks as with others that regret having installed it after this period of time. I am very unsure about doing this update on myMacBook Pro (Mid 2007). Many thanks for your reply. 05/01/2016 Mathias Reply Nice macbook :) As I posted above, just upgrade the memory to 6GB or more and an SSD drive. el cap will run way faster then snow leo. 05/06/2016 John LeMay Reply Nice write up. I just upgraded my 2011 MBPs (2 of them) with SSDs. I did Time Machine restores which I was a bit concerned with since I feared brining back the problems that caused me to not use these for much for a couple of years. However it’s a huge improvement. These machines are like new now and I love them again. Kudos to OWC for a great install kit and video that made it simple. Now that I see El Capitan shouldn’t slow me down I am considering upgrading from Mavericks myself. 05/07/2016 Mathias Reply Thx, nice to hear that you MPS are performing well. Did you upgrade the memory in both also ? For 100 euro you can have two 8gb DDR3 modules (Kingston DDR3 1600Mhz) Most mac’s are clocked at lower Mhz, and they have a memory limit, that is not very technically accurate :) Neither the memory clock or maximum limit are correct, just put the existing ram in de first slot and the new one in the above slot. That would make 10GB of both of your MPS, it will prevent falling on swap and be even more snappy. Of course with an SSD swapping would also be way faster than the original 5400rpm drive. 05/20/2016 Eugene Brown Reply I currently have a late 2007 imac (7,1) runs a 2.4GHZ core 2 duo proc, 4GB 667MHZ DDR2 ram, 800MHZ BUS. I am currently running Snow Leopard 10.6.8. How high can I upgrade the OS version on this machine ? Will I be able to at least do Mountain Lion, or can I go all the way up to El Capitan ? Gene B. 05/20/2016 Eugene Brown Reply … I forgot to mention that I have a 320GB HD. 05/21/2016 too slow on older imac major finder delay issues. Reply Yosemite, mavericks, and El capitan ran on my mid 2007 imac. (2 Ghz, 4GB RAM) but it was quite slow. creating new folders, moving files and folders to the trash, duplicating files and folders has a noticeable delay (sometimes up to 4 seconds or so). basic finder operations are annoyingly slow. I went back to snow leopard to get my “speed” back. 05/21/2016 Mathias Reply Hi both iMacs can be upgraded to be able to run el Captain smoothly (even better than snow leo) Core 2 Duo is fast enough for el, 4GB ram is short but enough for multitasking and if you combine it with an ssd some swapping won’t slow down your mac compared with the 5400rpm drive. The only downside is the memory DDR2 clocked at 667Mhz, I would stick to those specifications. You can buy one 4GB RAM module and replace a 2GB biuld-in module and get a total of 6GB which will make el a bit smoother and avoid the use of the swap space. The downside is that the 1x4gb memory module cost around 90€, it’s DDR2 so less common. Get an ssd drive (choose the size you wan’t) and your iMac will be running el like a charm. Btw, if you youtube on memory and ssd installation on your iMac it seems quite nice to upgrade with a good screwdriver set. Good luck and have fun :) 05/30/2016 Satish S Reply Recently I upgraded my 2010 MacBook 10.6.8 to EI Capitan. The upgrade itself went well, although it took quite long. Certainly performance has gone down. Now my Macbook doesn’t boot instantly. Desktop doesn’t get restored immediately after logging in. Software updates are only possible via Appstore whose UI is not responsive…infact very slow, and somehow updates fail to resume from pause. 05/30/2016 Mathias Reply The same as mine :) Already posted above, get more ram and an ssd. Just open de back cover and you have directly access to the memory slot and hd placement. A five minute job on a macbook mid 2010. 05/31/2016 Claudia Putnam Reply Hesitant. My mid-2011 11″ Macbook Air is on the list of supported machines but it had a hard time with Yosemite and I had to roll back to Mavericks. Which it is suddenly struggling with now. I’d like to go up to El Cap because I want the new trackpad, but I’m thinking it’s probably not the best idea. I have 4 RAM and 120 GB on an SSD. I don’t think any of these are changeable in the Air. 05/31/2016 Nikki & iMac Reply Craig, we match! I also upgraded my iMac hard disk drive to a shiny new SSD and the performance boost really blows my mind. Now my Mac takes only 10 seconds to fully start up, compared to about 30 secs in the old days. When OS X El Capitan was firstly introduced in September last year, I was a bit hesitated to conduct the update mainly because many fellow users reported speed issues and it seems taking forever to complete the entire installation process. Fortunately that didn’t happen to me, it only took about 2 hours. Though I had to wait Spotlight to finish indexing for the next day, overall I am quite happy that I chose to upgrade. Thanks for all the hints. I’ll obviously look out for your insights for the next Mac guides. 06/06/2016 Maxine Reply Upgraded my late 2010 iMac and TOTAL DISASTER! Non stop application crashes, panic attacks, etc Replaced a perfectly good hard drive with an SSD, spent hundreds of dollars having someone test the HW and finally found out through a friend of my repair guy that El Capitan breaks old iMacs. Now i have a system with a 2010 OS that I have to upgrade to Mavericks or Yosemite so my daughter can use it. C’mon Apple, just be straight with us! 08/12/2016 Brom198 Reply Why would El capitan break old Macs? Never heard of such nonsense 06/06/2016 Mathias Reply Your iMac has an i3 cpu and 4GB ram if I am not wrong, you changed the hd by an ssd and have already a nice cpu and enough ram. (you could add more) I think that the ssd is broken, if still under warranty should be no problem to get another one. On youtube upgrading your iMac and running el cap seems to be no problem a all. It’s not iMac that matters but the hardware that’s in it. El Cap is faster, apple worked well on performance instead of features, marvericks and yosemite are slower and certainly on older mac’s. 07/05/2016 Dianne Gerrity Reply Upgraded to El Capitan from OS X 10.8.5. The procedure went smoothly on this late 2008 iMac with 2TB HD (1.7 TB free so lots of room) and 4GB 800mHz memory. It took about 1 hour or a bit more. The problem came in that from any application on El Capitan that required iCloud login (such as mail, messages, photos, app store, itunes), constant Verification Error. Spent all day trying different solutions mentioned online. None worked. Which meant I could not sync my iPhone or even update my apps since I could not connect to the app store with ANY iCloud login. However, using chrome or safari–>easy login to iCloud. Just can’t using the apps from El Capitan. Restored to 10.8.5 from Time machine. At least it works. I have a newer iMac running Yosemite. Not sure if I will give that one a try with El Capitan. It is my main iMac and I don’t want to lose that one. 07/30/2016 Neil Bhogal Reply I have IMAC early 2008 with SSD and 4gb ram currently running Yosemite ok. I’m gonna upgrade the ram to 6GB so hopefully El Capitan will be ok on my old machine 08/07/2016 Mathias Reply I don’t use iCloud, only on my iPhone and iPad. On my Mini-mac and iBook I don’t use iCloud (skip option at install), no reason I use my provider for mail and all other stuff is on my file server. Third party applications works just fine (VLC and other). Can imagine that when you upgrade with iCloud stuff on things get tricky. Clean install is a must for stability and good performance. 08/12/2016 Brom198 Reply I installed El Capitan on my mac mini early 2009. It ran fine but a bit slow at times with the old 5400 rpm hard drive and only 4 gb of ram. So i upgraded it to 8 gb of ram and swapped the hd for a ssd from crucial. Now it’s faster than ever before! Mostly thanks to the ssd. Make sure to do a clean install when you upgrade to ssd! 08/23/2016 Aivaras Reply Mid 2009 MacbookPro was really slow on Mountain Lion due to too many software running. Decided I need a fresh install of El capitan and no upgrade which would still carry all the old software from the old version. Installed El Capitan on bootable USB. Now it’s perfectly usable and visually very pretty and pleasing. With Itunes, Mail, Safari, Terminal running I’m at 3.3GB used ram out of 4GB. So definitely will be upgrading ram since I’ll be out of ram if I decide to run Photoshop or iMovie.. Runs pretty fine without ssd, but considering the prices now for 128gb ssd it’s definitely worth to upgrade too! 08/27/2016 Ryan Reply I have a late-2011 MBP, the last of the anit-glare screens. In late 2014 to early 2015, after the debacle Apple had with the graphics card failings that brought about their repair program, my MBP had a graphics card replacement. My SPECS: Processor: 2.2 Ghz Intel i7 Memory: 4 GB 1333 MHz DDR3 The GRAPHICS CARD: AMD Radeon HD 6750M 512 MB I’m currently on 10.7.5 and concerned about doing ANY upgrades, especially to El Capitan. Has anybody had the graphics card issues and upgraded successfully? Any thoughts on what I should do? Thank you all for your advice in advance, much appreciated! 09/10/2016 Jef Reply I installed Maverick on my MacBook Pro (15-inch, 2.53GHz Mid 2009, 4mb ram) & had serious speed issues, so much that I installed Lion. Now I’m realizing need to upgrade ran to 8gb, then attempt to upgrade my OS 10/02/2016 Stanley swiniarski Reply Installed El Capitan on my 2009 Mac Pro (4,1). First thing I got upon reboot with the new OS was a kernel panic that looked like it was USB-related. I still get those intermittently. Once I got past that, performance is sluggish, and graphics are now choppy. I installed all the stuff people have suggested – turn off transparency, left it on for a weekend to let Spotlight re-index everything, ran the hardware test and no errors. I work with Logic Pro X and it is unusable now because the scrolling and meters do not display in real time. If I type into anything, there’s a delay before I see the characters. I Hate to spend the money on a new graphics card to find out that doesn’t fix it. It’s a dual quad with 29Gb of RAM and 300GB of free SSD hard drive space and an Nvidia Geforce GT 120 with 512k cache , so no excuses why El Capitan working so terribly on this system. 10/08/2016 DDS Reply Early 2008 Imac, cannot install 10/22/2016 Sheep Reply El Cap is rubbish on my early 2011 MBP with 512gb Samsung 840 pro SSD and 16gb of ram. Eat’s my battery life like its never fed before! Downgraded back to Maverics and yes I’m flying again with twice as much battery life. I think it is Apples way of making you upgrade your hardware.MORE £$£$£$£$. 11/05/2016 Mathias Reply El Captain is running fine on mac-mini (mid 2011) with of course ssd and 12gb ram. The same for my Macbook (mid 2010). Tried Sierra today on my mac-mini and it performs as well as El Captain, aside the extra new features I don’t see any major differences. Reverted again to El Captain with my Time Machine external drive, don’t need the Sierra extra features and Siri won’t listen so well, lol. 01/11/2017 Test Reply wtf is the purpose of this article 02/09/2017 Mark Reply I tried to read most of the comments then just jumped to the end. For what’s it worth I have a used 17″MacBook Pro late 2008 2.5 Ghz Intel Core 2 Duo 4 GB memory 733 GB hard drive. It was running Mountain Lion and I jumped to El Captain 10.11.6 runs great no problems that I know of. Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

Close share panel Image copyright Nordic Walkers / Facebook With the clicking of poles and a determined stride, the Winchester Nordic Walking group is a distinctive sight as its members pound the Hampshire countryside. The day I bumped into them, all but one was using some form of fitness tracker. A few Fitbits, a Garmin smartwatch, a couple of phone apps and one basic pedometer - and all, they claimed, were roughly counting the same paces. "Before I had a watch it didn't bother me, now I've got one I hate being without it," said group leader Linda Bidder. Christiane Livingstone oversees Nordic walking groups around the UK. "Fitness trackers (of all sorts) are incredibly popular in my groups," she said. "People love to know how far they have walked and even compete with each other." And yet the wearables market has had a rollercoaster ride in recent months. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The Fitbit brand is popular but has reported slower sales This time last year analysts were making multi-billion dollar forecasts for the developers of health trackers and smartwatches, and Apple was boldly selling a $10,000 gold edition of the Apple Watch. But by November 2016 Smartwatch shipments declined by 51.6% year-on-year, according to a report by market analysts IDC. Jawbone, once a popular fitness tracker brand, confirmed to TechCrunch that it is leaving the consumer market and focusing on healthcare providers. Microsoft has removed its Fitness Band on its online store (although it is still available on retail giant Amazon) and crucially no longer provides the Band developer kits. Fitbit remains a key brand name at the heart of the fitness tracker revolution - and it acquired one of its rivals, the Pebble Watch - but it was recently reported to be laying off staff, and founder James Park said the firm experienced "softer than expected" sales during the recent Christmas period. 10,000 steps Various devices claim to measure heart rate, sleep, activity and count calories. Counting steps is probably the most common use of wearable devices - but recently experts have questioned whether the golden goal of walking 10,000 steps a day is actually worthwhile, and a US study concluded that health trackers did not aid weight loss. Analyst Ben Wood, from CCS Insight, was such a wearables enthusiast that he still wears one on each wrist - but even he speaks more cautiously these days about the sector overall. "The reality is these devices have stalled in the marketplace," he told BBC Radio 4's You and Yours programme. "A lot of people have got them, a lot of people like them but the spectacular explosive growth that we anticipated hasn't really occurred." Image copyright Ben Wood Image caption Ben Wood (right) was interviewed by Peter White from BBC Radio 4's You and Yours programme Ben Wood thinks there's an engagement issue - after a while these devices don't tell you anything new. There's also the battery issue, and the fact that many of the older and cheaper varieties aren't water resistant. Furthermore, Simon Bryant from Futuresource says many wearables aren't yet independent enough and rely on being tethered to a smartphone, or replicate a functionality, such as step counting, that the handset already has. However Mr Bryant believes that while wearables may be down, they are not yet out. "We feel the slowdown is temporary and the market will accelerate this year," he said. He thinks that improved power, appearance, and mobile pay options could give them a boost alongside a maturing user group. Things do appear to be looking up. Sales figures for 2016 just released by IDC indicate 25% market growth year-on-year, with Fitbit taking the largest share - followed by budget brand Xiaomi. Image copyright Garmin Image caption According to one report Garmin shipped 6.1 million wearable devices in 2016 One of the top five sellers is Garmin, which has focused on the dedicated fitness market. Theo Axford, senior product marketing manager at Garmin UK, told the BBC that while the market had become "very competitive" the firm had not experienced declining sales. "Brands must ensure that they are meeting the needs of the customer and always delivering value," he said. "Whilst the entry space has become largely commoditised, customers that have bought into the technology as a first foray into wearables are now looking for, and demanding more. "The advocacy we've experienced for our devices over many years in what was a fairly specialist market has now become much more mainstream, and customers are looking for a brand with the specialist expertise and a legacy they can trust." And what about smartwatches - once feted as the ultimate smartphone accessory with multiple tracking functions and apps? Image caption The first edition of the Apple Watch gave the market a boost Ben Wood argues that they are "a solution that's looking for a problem" - but robust sales of the Apple Watch and Google's current rollout of a new operating source for Android-powered watches, Android Wear 2.0, suggest the industry has not given up on them yet. In December 2016 Apple CEO Tim Cook said sales growth was "off the charts" following the release of the Apple Watch 2 in September, and Android watchmaker Samsung showed the biggest growth year-on-year in IDC's report. "The smart wearables market is changing," said Ramos Llamas from IDC. "Health and fitness remains a major focus, but once these devices become connected to a cellular network, expect unique applications and communications capabilities to become available." And this will allow them to make a bid for freedom, he believes. "This will also solve another key issue: freeing the device from the smartphone, creating a stand-alone experience."

Corporate tax cuts and reduced regulations planned by President Donald Trump will give companies reason to spend more on Cloud Computing, factory automation and smart connectivity that will directly benefit Silicon Valley, many believe. The tax cuts are going to promote business investment across all industries, and the business investment is largely going to be in technology. Strong performances from big names including Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB) have helped make technology the strongest S&P 500 sector YTD, rising 10% compared to the broader index’s 6% rise. In the past month, investors have poured $325-M into to the US-listed Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEArca:XLK), according to www.ETF.com, which tracks fund flows. The proliferation of smart, connected devices in homes, factories and stores is leading to the collection unprecedented amounts of data and creating demand for more computing power to analyze it. Spending on Cloud Computing will grow by 21.5% a year through Y 2020, almost 7X as fast as overall IT spending, according to a recent estimate by market research firm IDC. Improved employment and consumer confidence have also been behind investors’ optimism about tech, helping offset concerns about the high valuations. After an 8-yr US stock market rally, nearly all sectors are trading at earnings multiples above their long-term average, but none more so than technology, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream. The tech sector’s strong performance has left it trading at 17.9X expected earnings, compared to its 10-year average of 14.5X expected earnings. The S&P tech sector’s P/E (price-to-earnings)  multiple has been above its own long-term average for about a year, and during that time the sector has risen about 28%. Tech Bulls believe earnings momentum is growing for the sector. S&P 500 tech earnings expanded 12.3% in Q-4, more than any other sector, according to Thomson Reuters data. Analysts on average expect 13.6% growth for the March Quarter. I cannot remember a time when we have seen this much excitement. Semiconductors are not as cyclical as they used to be, where Q’s were driven by PC demand. Now it is automotive, it’s data center, industrial automation.

This feature allows users to long-press on an iMessage and add a reaction like a thumbs-up or thumbs-down to it. Now, Facebook is apparently testing a similar feature in its Messenger app. Mujjo Wallet iPhone 7 Case As first noted by TechCrunch and later confirmed by Facebook, the new reactions feature in Messenger is similar to the expanded reactions that are available in response to posts in the Newsfeed. What’s different about the reactions available in Messenger compared to the Newsfeed, however, is the inclusion of a Dislike button. This has been one of the most-requested features for Facebook, but the company has routinely said it would not add a Dislike button for Newsfeed posts. Speaking to TechCrunch, however, Facebook explained that in Messenger, it sees the Dislike button as more of a way to say “No” to something. It says people often use Messenger for planning and coordination, and it’s experimenting to see if reactions are helpful for quick logistics and voting In order to add a reaction to a Messenger reply, you simply hover over the message and choose from the list of available options. From there, you’ll see your reaction and a total count of how many reactions that message has. At this point Facebook says it is only testing reactions in Messenger with a small number of users on the web. If the feature is met with a positive response (or reaction), however, the company says that it will expand it to all users and presumably to all platforms, like iOS. “We’re always testing ways to make Messenger more fun and engaging. This is a small test where we enable people to share an emoji that best represents their feelings on a message.” That means not everyone has access now, but if people enjoy it, Messenger Reactions could roll out to all users. Messenger reactions are incredibly similar to what’s available in iMessage right now. For a full rundown of everything that was introduced to Messages in iOS, read our full breakdown here.

What a week! The annual Mobile World Congress (MWC) took place in Barcelona from Monday to Thursday, and there was no shortage of big announcements at that event – but there was plenty of exciting news and developments across the rest of the tech world too. If (somehow!) you’re not familiar with MWC, this quick video intro from the beginning of the week should give you some idea of what it’s all about: If you struggled to keep up with everything that’s been happening this week, don’t worry – 7 Days is here again to walk you through the week’s top tech news. There’s a lot to get through this week, so let’s waste no more time! The new BlackBerry KEYone was among the many new devices unveiled at (or immediately before) MWC. The $549 upper-mid-range Android 7.0 handset was designed and built by TCL, which referred to it as a 'flagship', although it doesn't have the specs to match rival flagship-class handsets from other manufacturers. There's plenty to like about the new device, though - and you can get a first look at it in my hands-on video from the launch event (I hope you like videos, because there's lot more of them coming up!). Reports have since emerged of up to three more BlackBerry-branded devices on the way this year, including photos of one with a very different design to the KEYone. In off-camera conversations at the KEYone launch event, several BlackBerry staff hinted to me that a 'true' flagship is in development, possibly with a Snapdragon 835 processor. The stunning new LG G6 also made its debut at MWC, featuring an unusually wide 5.7-inch Quad HD+ display with an 18:9 aspect ratio. Along with a stylish metallic body, it also features a Snapdragon 821 processor, 4GB RAM and up to 64GB storage, along with IP68 dust- and water-resistance and a fingerprint sensor. I'm already a fan of this device, especially its dual 13MP rear cameras which are capable of snapping some great shots. Check out my hands-on video with the LG G6 here. Huawei introduced its new P10 and P10 Plus flagships just before MWC at a rather poorly organized event which left hundreds of journalists standing outside the venue for hours, long after the event had already begun. During the announcement itself, Huawei spent around half an hour talking about the many colors of the new handsets, so perhaps those of us left outside were the lucky ones. Nonetheless, the new P10 family are beautiful handsets with plenty of high-end specs, and a new version of Huawei's dual-camera technology co-engineered with imaging specialists Leica. You can find my hands-on video for the P10 here. Alongside the P10, Huawei also announced the Watch 2 and Watch 2 Classic, its new Android Wear 2.0 smartwatches, which include IP68 protection, a dazzling array of color options and all sorts of premium specs and features. The Watch 2 also includes integrated 4G LTE connectivity. Nokia was one of the biggest stars of MWC this year - quite a turnaround from what appeared to be the end of its mobile ambitions following the sale of its devices business to Microsoft in 2014. Among its many announcements in Barcelona, Nokia revealed that it's killing off the Withings brand for its wearable devices, in favor of its own brand. The Nokia 6 Android smartphone - designed and developed by HMD Global, built by Foxconn, and sold under the Nokia brand - launched in China in December. At MWC, HMD announced that it will soon be launching the 6 internationally, priced around €229 EUR. HMD also unveiled the Nokia 3 and Nokia 5, its new entry-level and mid-range handsets, respectively. You can view the full specs for both devices here, and as I discussed in my hands-on video with the two new Android smartphones, they appear hugely impressive - especially considering their relatively low prices. But the biggest attraction at Nokia's MWC stand was a blast from the past. HMD announced a new version of its much-loved classic phone, the Nokia 3310, updated with a range of more modern features. Every time I visited or walked past the Nokia stand, it was packed with people of all ages - including those too young to remember the original - wanting to get their hands on the new 3310. As you'll see in my hands-on video with the device, it's far from perfect - but there's a lot to like about it. It even includes a new version of the old-school Snake game, which is also coming to Facebook. Archos showed off its new low-cost Android 7.0 tablet. Despite being aimed at budget-conscious buyers, the 101 Saphir offers some rather nice features, including dust- and water-resistance, and a rugged design offering some protection against drops. Samsung had already confirmed that its new Galaxy S8 flagship wouldn't appear at MWC, but the company did announce the launch date for the new handset. And the leaks about the Galaxy S8 just keep coming - new images have emerged twice in the last few days. Samsung revealed its new rugged Galaxy XCover 4 smartphone with a 5-inch 720p display, IP68 rating, and MIL-STD-810G impact protection. It will ship in Europe with Android 7.0 onboard from April, priced around €259. Samsung also introduced a new version of its Gear VR headset, co-developed with Oculus, featuring a new controller with improved navigation. Samsung's new Galaxy Tab S3 made its first official appearance at MWC too. The high-end Android tablet has a Snapdragon 820 processor, 4GB RAM and 32GB storage, along with a keyboard cover and S Pen stylus support. And Samsung showed off its new Windows 10 2-in-1, the Galaxy Book, which comes in two configurations: a Windows 10 Home model with 10.6-inch LCD and 7th-gen Intel Core m3 processor; and a Windows 10 Pro version with a 12-inch Super AMOLED display and 7th-gen Core i5. Both models support 4G LTE and come with a keyboard and S Pen stylus. You can get more info on both variants in my hands-on video here. Porsche Design revealed its new premium Windows 10 laptop. Unlike Samsung's Galaxy Book - which is a tablet with detachable keyboard cover - Porsche Design's new Book One is an actual notebook (albeit with a detachable display!). It's conceptually similar to Microsoft's Surface Book, and features Intel's latest Kaby Lake processors, 16GB RAM and 512GB SSD. Panasonic showed off its latest Toughbook, an ultra-rugged Windows 10 detachable that's waterproof and has a briefcase-style carrying handle. It's packed full of the latest high-end specs - but it will come at quite a high price. Alcatel introduced its Plus12 Windows 10 2-in-1 aimed primarily at business buyers on a budget. It features some pretty modest specs, but - as you'll see in my hands-on video - it also has one of the worst keyboards I've encountered for some time. Alcatel's Idol 4S with Windows 10 has been available in the US for months, but the company finally announced its European launch this week, priced at €599. For some reason, the device has been rebranded as the 'Idol 4 Pro' for Europe, but the Windows 10 Mobile flagship's features are identical to those of its US counterpart. Image via PC World Our friends over at PC World spotted a refreshed version of HP's Elite x3 Windows 10 Mobile flagship that had accidentally appeared on its stand at MWC. However, when I went down there to check it out, the company had removed it from view, and its staff rather joylessly refused to say anything about it, brusquely parroting the phrase "we haven't announced anything". Still, HP did announce new accessories for the Elite x3, as well as revealing the Pro x2 612 G2, a premium 12-inch 2-in-1 targeting enterprise customers. The Elite x3 also received a firmware update this week, bringing performance improvements and camera optimizations. Lenovo unveiled a range of new Android devices aimed at families, including some features designed with kids in mind... ...as well as a selection of new Windows 10 devices covering a wide range of price points. The Miix 320 - which is priced as low as $199.99 USD - was my personal favorite, offering some very nice features, along with rock-solid build quality. But the new additions to the Lenovo range include a 14-inch Yoga 520 notebook, and two flagship-class Yoga 720 convertibles with stylus support, stylish design, and beautiful displays. You can get an overview of all four of those new Lenovo Windows 10 devices in my hands-on video. Lenovo's rather lovely new G5 and G5 Plus mid-range smartphones were revealed at MWC too. They offer a decent set of specs combined with some thoughtful design features, along with stylish looks. The G5 was one of my personal favorites at MWC - you can see my impressions of both handsets in my hands-on video. Sony revealed four new Xperia devices in Barcelona, including two high-end handsets, the Xperia XZ Premium and Xperia XZs. The Premium features Sony's Motion Eye camera technology which offers slow motion video capture at up to 960fps. But perhaps the most exciting device on Sony's stand was the Xperia Touch, a €1,500 EUR device running Android 7.0 that projects its user interface onto a flat surface, turning it into a 23-inch touch display. The projector is portable too, but it currently offers just one hour of battery life. Find out more about that device in my hands-on video here. Jolla announced that it has added support for its Sailfish OS on some of Sony's Xperia devices. The company also revealed plans to build a local mobile OS aimed specifically at China. Chinese manufacturer ZTE revealed its new Blade V8 Lite and Mini handsets, offering lesser specs in a more affordable package than the Blade V8 Pro that it announced at CES in January. Xiaomi showed off its new Mi 5c featuring the company's own Surge S1 processor, along with 3GB RAM, 64GB storage and a 5.5-inch display. Xiaomi also introduced its new Redmi 4X, a low-cost smartphone with Qualcomm's latest mid-range Snapdragon 435 chipset, and a very spacious 4100mAh battery, priced from as little as $102. Meanwhile, General Mobile debuted the GM6, the latest handset to launch under Google's Android One initiative. While the new devices were the major focus of attention at MWC, they weren't the only big announcements at the show. Meizu, for example, revealed its new Super mCharge battery technology with a live demo in which it charged a flagship phone with a 3000mAh battery from 0% to 100% in just 18 minutes. And in a year when 'the next big thing' was the subject of endless discussion at MWC, the International Telecommunication Union released a draft report detailing the specifications of the next-generation 5G mobile standard, promising 20Gbps download speeds and latency as low as 1ms. Image via Shutterstock The GSM Association, which hosts the Mobile World Congress expo each year, published its annual Mobile Economy report, in which it estimated that there will be five billion mobile users by mid-2017. Moving on from MWC, fresh details emerged this week of Apple's plans for its 'Anniversary iPhone', which is due to arrive later this year. The Wall Street Journal reported that the new handset will include a curved AMOLED screen along with USB Type-C support, while a separate report suggested that Apple is investing heavily in augmented reality technology for the device. Nvidia announced details of its new GeForce GTX 1080 Ti GPU, with a whopping 11GB of GDDR5X memory. Pre-orders opened on Thursday, and deliveries will begin on March 10. The Raspberry Pi Foundation marked the fifth anniversary of its original maker board by announcing a new variant of the ultra-low-cost Raspberry Pi Zero, which now features 802.11n Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.0 for just $10. Elsewhere, an intrepid developer built a Raspberry Pi wearable device running Windows 98 (!!). Developer Michael Darby said: "I thought, wouldn’t it be ridiculous and awesome to have Windows 98 on my wrist?" Yes, Michael - "ridiculous and awesome" is the exact phrase I would have chosen. Love it! <3 "Hello, computer" There was much rejoicing among Star Trek fans in January when Amazon added 'Computer' as a wake-word for its Alexa digital assistant. Now, the company is apparently preparing to add new capabilities to Alexa, including voice calling functionality. Google has started to bring its digital Assistant to millions more Android devices, after initially limiting it to its Pixel phones, Android Wear devices, and its Home speaker hub. And the long wait for Google Home to launch in the UK will soon be over. The company announced that it will launch there in June, although pricing hasn't yet been revealed. There's been some confusion surrounding the future of Google's Pixel laptops running Chrome OS. At a roundtable with reporters at MWC, Google gave the clear impression that it would not launch any more of its own-branded Chromebooks - but a few days later, it stated that its Pixel laptops aren't dead after all. However, Google did confirm that it will definitely be launching new Pixel smartphones later this year. Google's Nougat update continued to slowly make its way to more devices around the world in recent days: Droid Turbo 2 on Verizon gets Android 7.0 update Android 7.0 begins rolling out to the Moto G4 and G4 Plus in the US You can now sign up for the Honor 6X beta program to get Android 7.0 Android 7.1.2 Nougat beta finally heads to the Nexus 6P OnePlus 3 and 3T get Android 7.1.1 beta in China (HydrogenOS) and other markets (OxygenOS) Microsoft updated its Arrow Launcher for Android to version 3.0, calling it the "biggest release yet", bringing new features and major performance enhancements. A couple of days later, it rolled out beta version 3.1, bringing support for Android tablets. We got a small taste of what might have been for Microsoft's Windows 10 Mobile flagships, as a series of screenshots revealed support for unique gestures originally intended for inclusion on the Lumia 950 and 950 XL - some of which may have been developed as part of the stillborn Lumia McLaren project. Skype for Linux emerged from the alpha phase of its development with the release of a new beta that included all sorts of improvements and new features. Meanwhile, Microsoft announced that it is discontinuing its Skype WiFi service at the end of this month - and it's not yet clear what the future holds for the separate Microsoft WiFi offering. Microsoft Edge's share of the desktop browser market remains more or less stagnant, while Chrome has extended its lead from 57.94% to 58.53%, according to the latest data from NetMarketShare. NetMarketShare data also showed zero growth (in fact, a very slight decline) for Windows 10, while Windows 7's share of the desktop market grew from 47.20% last month to 48.41% this month. A similar picture was painted by the latest usage stats from gaming platform Steam, where Windows 10 usage declined by almost 1% in the last month, while Windows 7 increased. A new version of Windows 10's iconic 'hero' desktop wallpaper was spotted in the latest build of Windows 10 Cloud - and there's some speculation that the updated version may be unique to the Cloud SKU of the OS. A Windows 10 Cloud build that leaked earlier this week included the ability for users to download and install Win32 apps from the Windows Store. The upcoming Windows 10 Creators Update will include the option to prevent users from installing any apps except those downloaded from the Windows Store, in an effort to improve on-device security. Microsoft outlined details of new controls over Windows Update that will be introduced with the Creators Update in the next few weeks. These will include more granular controls for when to schedule updates and associated reboots. Thanks to Microsoft's new Unified Update Platform, or UUP, future updates for Windows Insiders could see download sizes reduced by up to 65%. It's been a busy week for Windows Insiders, with numerous new builds being released. After Windows 10 build 15046 brought new features to PCs in the Fast ring on Tuesday, Microsoft rolled out build 15048 to Fast ring PCs on Friday, along with build 15047 to Windows 10 Mobile devices. Build 15043 also made its way to Windows 10 Mobile handsets in the Slow ring on Thursday - the first Slow ring build for those devices since December. On top of that, Windows 10 SDK Preview build 15042 was released on Wednesday... ...along with ISOs for Windows 10 build 15042 for PCs. Microsoft introduced Wake-on-LAN support for its Surface devices when used in conjunction with a Surface Ethernet adapter or dock - a very welcome addition, and rather a long time coming! Microsoft also announced general availability of Visio Online on Wednesday, following several months in public preview. Coinciding with that announcement, it also added a couple of new features. The Movies & TV app on Windows 10 (known as Films & TV in the United Kingdom) was updated for Windows Insiders to include support for 360-degree video, along with some other improvements. However, in less welcome news, Microsoft slashed its OneDrive storage allowances on Wednesday. The company had previously announced plans to remove its 'unlimited' storage plan, blaming customers for using too much of their unlimited allowance. All customers who previously had an unlimited or 10TB allowance will now see their storage reduced to just 1TB. Here's everything you need to know about the implications of those changes. And Microsoft announced a further change on Wednesday, ditching its Windows Holographic brand in favor of 'Windows Mixed Reality'. The new name sounds rather bland in comparison to the old one, but it was a necessary change, given that the virtual reality headsets that run the OS offer none of the 'holographic' elements available on augmented reality devices like HoloLens. Microsoft confirmed to Neowin on Wednesday that it will be bringing mixed reality experiences to both its current Xbox One consoles, and to its new Project Scorpio console, in 2018. It will begin shipping mixed reality dev kits this month, including a headset manufactured by Acer. On Tuesday, Microsoft announced its new Xbox Game Pass, a $10 monthly subscription offering unlimited access to over 100 games for Xbox owners. The new service will be launching this Spring, and you can check out all the games that will be available on day one here. Xbox One Insider Preview build 15039 was released to the Beta ring last weekend, while build 15045 made its way to the Alpha ring on Tuesday with several new features. Build 15046 was pushed to the Alpha ring on Thursday with various fixes for a range of issues. Over 1,000 games are currently being created by developers under the ID@Xbox program; on Wednesday, Microsoft announced details of 22 of those games that are coming to both the Xbox One and Windows 10. Battlefield 1 is free to play this weekend for Xbox Live Gold subscribers, and will also be available to buy with a hefty discount. But after a wonderful and exciting week, our odyssey across the tech world ends this week on a truly sad note. Last weekend, gamer Brian Vigneault died in the final hours of a 24-hour gaming marathon. He was live-streaming his gaming session on Twitch in an effort to raise money for the Make-A-Wish Foundation, which arranges memorable and happy experiences for terminally ill children. 22 hours into his marathon, the 35-year-old took a break from the stream, but never returned. Brian had previously raised over $11,000 for non-profits during the course of five years as a charity live-streamer. The thoughts of the whole Neowin team are with his family and friends. Bonus content Before we wrap things up for another week, let me first highlight a few extra bits around the site that I hope you’ll enjoy reading. Timi Cantisano reviewed the unusual GPD WIN, a handheld computer with a built-in QWERTY keyboard, and gaming controls, including a direction pad, thumbsticks and ABXY buttons. That's definitely worth a read! Byron Hinson published his review of Sniper Elite 4, which is available on the Xbox One, PlayStation 4 and PC. The game isn't for the squeamish as it can get a bit gory at times, but Byron found it to be a lot of fun, although it can become a bit repetitive. Check out his full review here. And after an action-packed week at Mobile World Congress, crammed full of big announcements, we're eager to hear your thoughts on what was revealed at the event. Was there a particular device that you're looking forward to buying? A new technology that you're keen to try out? A new machine that you're determined to save up for and treat yourself to? Or just something that you really like the look of? Join in the discussion, and have your say! ...and finally, don't forget that you can check out all of our coverage from Mobile World Congress right here. Stay tuned to Neowin in the days ahead for what’s sure to be another exciting week, filled with official news, lots of updates, and plenty of insights from around the world of technology.

Slashdot reader Atticus Rex writes: On Monday, W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) director Tim Berners-Lee released a post defending his decision to allow Netflix, Microsoft, Apple and Google to enshrine DRM in Web standards, arguing that blocking it would be pointless. Zak Rogoff, FSF campaigns manager, writes in the response: "As Director of the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium), Berners-Lee has the ability to block [the DRM proposal] from ratification as an official Web standard... Of course, a refusal to ratify could not immediately stop the use of DRM, but it could meaningfully weaken the position of DRM in the court of public opinion, and put EME proponents Netflix, Microsoft, Apple, and Google on notice that a very prominent figure was willing to stand up to them on behalf of users. Changes in society's technological infrastructure require political movements, not just technological arguments, and political movements benefit greatly from the support of prominent figures." Berners-Lee takes the position that "The web has to be universal, to function at all. It has to be capable of holding crazy ideas of the moment, but also the well polished ideas of the century. It must be able to handle any language and culture. It must be able to include information of all types, and media of many genres. Included in that universality is that it must be able to support free stuff and for-pay stuff, as they are all part of this world. "This means that it is good for the web to be able to include movies, and so for that, it is better for HTML5 to have EME than to not have it." drm html5 internet ← Related Links → FCC Chair Wants Carriers To Block Robocalls From Spoofed Numbers The FSF Is 30 Years Old; Where Should They Go From Here?

Had the W3C not punted on the DRM scheme itself, Berners-Lee's comments would have been legitimate if not what we necessarily wanted.

You cannot have an open source implementation of DRM, because anyone can simply modify the code to remove the encryption and make the unencrypted stream available. You can standardise a mechanism for plugging proprietary DRM modules into the web, but you're still reliant on the vendors to provide them for your platform of choice.

Seriously, is this the cliche of the month club and I missed the memo? No, the Internet does not interpret censorship as anything. The Internet is not alive, and the actions taken to distribute works illegally are ultimately taken by people. Also, comparing measures to prevent infringement of copyright, which is merely against laws that are widely applicable throughout the world, with the sometimes very real problems of actual censorship is just a propaganda move designed to attract an emotional response that is not otherwise justified. You're just repeating industry shill "the sky is falling" garbage. Someone who has a different point of view to you is not necessarily a shill. And if there really isn't a problem if we stop creating and distributing new works, why is the vast majority of piracy ripping those new works, instead of just sharing the "orders of magnitude more media than any human could possibly watch" that we already have? Apparently most pirates disagree with you about which work is more valuable. There is no money to be made in trying to scare pirates straight. There IS money in providing a convenient service, and DRM never adds convenience. It would be lovely if that were true, but I have been following this issue for a long time, and the evidence so far seems to say otherwise. How would you run a service like Netflix, which obviously a great many people find more convenient than other models for watching movies and TV shows, without DRM or some other system with a similar effect? You're trying to separate DRM from what makes a useful service and treat the two separately, but they aren't independent issues.

"Selected platforms and devices" is what we get without a standard. We know that because we've tried that for 25 years. How many years could Linux users not access Netflix. When I first got involved with the IETF (web standards group), ActiveX was the popular way to implement DRM. Meaning you could only see the content using Internet Explorer on Windows. Talk about "selected platforms"! Later DRM on the web commonly used Java for a few years, then Flash. Flash-based DRM lasted for many years, and there are still many sites that require the security nightmare known as Flash because that's how they do their DRM. Note in the above paragraph I never used the word "should". This isn't about what publishers "should" do, or what we'd like them to do. It's about what they actually do. What they actually do is require Flash in the best case DRM, and implement the Sony rootkit in other cases. Of course there are almost as many different ways of doing DRM as there are publishers using it - there is no standard. On the other hand, we've long had standards for video and images such as mpeg and jpeg. Are those limited to "selected platforms and devices"? No, the entire point of standardization is that a standard can be implemented on any platform and device. I've personally made the case against DRM to probably 100 of my customers (qho arw publishers) yet so many of them decide to go ahead and use DRM. About half choose a DRM solution that means I can't see their content on my device. Would a rather they each come up with their own incompatible, annoying DRM that doesn't let me view the content, or would I rather they use a compatible, cross-platform standard that anyone can view, developed with input from users? Given the options we actually have, I'd rather be involved in developing a usable standard than have another generation of Flash-based sites and Sony rootkits.

With EME you don't get a standard platform that anyone can implement in order to watch DRM-protected media. EME is a standardization of HTML hooks that allow portions of a web page to be decoded by a closed source, proprietary, non standardized binary plugin, that the content provider will choose. The difference from the past is that before EME, publishers would force you to install their proprietary plugin. With EME, they'll force you to use the proprietary browser (Chrome) or operating system (Android) that they think will prevent you from downloading their stuff. It's arguably even worse than the Sony rootkit, because you can be forced to use an operating system that has no root access for you but is safe for them. And since the proprietary plugin will not even need to be installed, because it will most probably come built-in with the browser or the OS, content providers will have even less disincentive to make use of it.

One approval is for a hardware device - a phone, tablet, dedicated player (e.g. Roku), Blu-ray player, etc. You submit a sample of this hardware, they go over it and OK it, and authorize you to stream to it. This is why the iPhones got Netflix before Android phones. Netflix had to submit just a few iPhone models for approval, so that happened pretty quickly. They had to submit hundreds of Android phone models for approval, so that took some time. The second type of approval is for software players. If you want to stream to a software player running on a general purpose computing device, Hollywood has much more stringent requirements. Their fear is that you'll run another program along-side the streaming video that peeks into the memory containing the decrypted stream, and save stream to disk thus giving you a DRM-free digital copy of the movie. Their "solution" is that the DRM and video decode process has to happen inside an encrypted virtual machine, which then sends each frame directly to the display device. They don't want a native Windows or OS X or Liinux binary which does this because someone could theoretically modify the binary before running to weaken or pierce the encrypted VM. That's why the players are coded in Flash or Silverlight (theoretically you could modify those as well, but it's a lot harder since a new copy of the player is sent when you begin streaming the movie). This insanity is also why playing streamed movies on PC requires much heftier hardware than mobile devices. Because the entire decode process has to happen inside the encrypted VM, you can't take advantage of dedicated video decode hardware built into every GPU since the late 1990s. The entire thing has to be done in software (moreover, software running in a VM). It's extremely CPU-intensive. That's why until recently you needed an i3 or better (Pentium or Atom wasn't enough) to stream 1080p movies from Netflix, Hulu, etc, while your phone with a low-end ARM processor could stream the same 1080p movie with no problems. Because the phone was approved as a hardware device, it's allowed to use dedicated video decoding hardware.

Blu-ray already fails this test, and I only purchase Blu-rays to strip the DRM and save a long-term format. I want the ability to gift, loan, or sell any media that I possess the rights to. I don't want to possess merely a ticket which grants me admittance to content for a limited time, under limited conditions, subject to the dissolution of whatever producer, licencor, or operator manages the DRM scheme. Because piracy has absolutely no effect on 99% of customers I am fairly certain that what content producers/licencors truly fear is "casual piracy" and fair use like loans and libraries where market forces drive the resale cost of digital media down to its natural price in the free market. It's perfectly natural to resist inferior DRM schemes by refusing to make them standard. If you want me to support an open DRM standard then it needs to be capability based with normal customers like you or me represented as first class owners of those capabilities and implement a durable scheme for transfer of those capabilities into the indefinite future. For example, consider a ownership-based scheme where producers issue N digitally-signed capabilities to a particular copyrighted work and sell them to customers on an electronic marketplace. Bitcoin has proven that it's possible to maintain a globally consistent transaction ledger of ownership of individual tokens, and a much cheaper implementation could maintain ownership and facilitate programmatic transfer of capabilities to digital works (to support sales, gifts, and even temporary loans) because the marginal value of acquiring more than one capability to the same work is zero and so there will be little need to spend gigawatts of electricity maintaining the blockchain against adversaries. The copyrighted work doesn't even have to be encrypted. Just make standards-compliant devices/software require current ownership of a capability to use the work. Yes, this is an easily defeated scheme for pirates, but so is every other DRM scheme.

But now a group of young, mostly female entrepreneurs is capitalizing on the gap that big players like Apple left in the market. By Mona Fromm Published on 04. March 2017, 14:00 Why it matters Why it matters The market for femtech services is growing, with the amount of venture capital raised by these firms crossing the billion-dollar threshold. Facts Facts Femtech firms provide apps and products specifically catering to female health and wellness needs. Forty-five startups in the industry have already received generous funding from institutional investors. The biggest hurdle for femtech entrepreneurs is that most investors and engineers are male and sometimes uncomfortable talking about female health. Audio Audio LISTEN Pdf Julie Askland, right, tries on an Ava fertility-tracking device, while talking with co-founder Lea von Bidder at the company's San Francisco office. Source: picture alliance / newscom Wearable technology tends to count the steps walked, monitor the heart rate or measure the quality of sleep – everything that men want from their gadgets. Female needs, however, are often ignored by this technology, a fact that a new group of female entrepreneurs is taking advantage of. One such entrepreneur is Lea von Bidder, whose company Ava produces a wristband that monitors women’s monthly cycle. The tracker collects data on sleep, breathing and blood flow, and is supposed to help women get pregnant more easily by telling them when they experience their most fertile days each month. The idea was born out of the real-life problems many women experience. “My co-founder and his girlfriend were trying to get pregnant,” Ms. von Bidder said. “Even under the best of circumstances, chances of conception in any month are only 25 percent,” she added. To optimize that process, Ms. von Bidder and three co-founders developed the Ava wristband, which sells for €249 ($263). Since 2014 more than $1.1 billion of venture capital has gone to tech companies that cater to female health and wellness needs, according to CB Insights, a service trying to predict technology trends. The list of 45 well-financed startups in the so-called femtech industry is likely to grow. “Sixty percent of smartphone users today already use their phone to look after their health.” Ida Tin, CEO, Clue According to the World Bank, 49.5 percent of the world’s population in 2015 was female, but the IT industry with its mostly male founders, investors and engineers has tended to ignore this half. The first Apple iPhone tracking functions for example included everything that men consider important when it comes to fitness and health. There was no option to collect data about menstrual cycles. Enter the femtech firms that count on tech-savvy female customers. “Sixty percent of smartphone users today already use their phone to look after their health,” said Ida Tin, chief executive of Clue, a startup that also offers a cycle-monitoring app. The Berlin-based company also has options to monitor pain during the period. “Women can take this data to the doctor and analyze them together to get better treatment,” Ms. Tin said. And the femtech services don’t stop at fertility and health concerns. Women have their own idea of good sex? How about a smart vibrator that adapts to individual preferences, as offered by California-based start-up Lioness. Need to work while pumping breastmilk? The U.S. firm Willow Pump offers a model that can be worn in the bra and leaves the mother’s hands free for other tasks. Some of the female entrepreneurs have had trouble selling their ideas to mostly male financiers. Miki Agrawal, whose New York startup Thinx sells period-proof underwear that absorbs menstrual blood and can be washed and reused, experienced this several times. “It was nearly impossible to raise money, because everyone we spoke to were men. Only 4 percent of women sit in senior-level, partner-level positions at funds to make these kinds of decisions,” she recently told Bloomberg. She got her first round of capital through the crowdfunding platform Kickstarter. Ms. von Bidder and her co-founders had fewer problems with financing. Ava has already attracted $12.3 million from investors and recently shifted its headquarters from Switzerland to Silicon Valley in order to become more global. The entrepreneur said she approaches potential investors confidently, partly because she’s convinced that better technology will always win out. “My co-founder’s girlfriend who was trying to get pregnant is in her 20s, and used to using apps in her daily life,” Ms. Bidder said. Measuring her temperature every morning at 6 a.m. or urinating on a stick 10 times a month to find her conception window is just not compatible with modern life anymore, Ms. von Bidder added. And the femtech products can speak to men too. Ava, for example, has a private Facebook group where customers can post about their experiences with the service. And the male partners, Ms. von Bidder said, look just as happy as the women when they announce in selfie videos that the couple is expecting a child.

(Reuters/Bobby Yip) Share Written by Josh Horwitz Obsession Shenzhen October 17, 2016 Shenzhen, China Yekutiel Sherman couldn’t believe his eyes. The Israeli entrepreneur had spent one year designing the product that would make him rich—a smartphone case that unfolds into a selfie stick. He had drawn up prototypes, secured some minimal funds from his family, and launched a crowdfunding campaign. He even shot a professional promo video, showing a couple taking the perfect selfie in front of the Eiffel Tower. (Stikbox) (Stikbox) But one week after his product hit Kickstarter in December 2015, Sherman was shocked to see it for sale on AliExpress—Alibaba’s English-language wholesale site. Vendors across China were selling identical smartphone case selfie-sticks, using the same design Sherman came up with himself. Some of them were selling for as low as $10 a piece, well below Sherman’s expected retail price of £39 ($47.41). Amazingly, some of these vendors stole the name of Sherman’s product—Stikbox: Sherman had become a victim of China’s lightning-fast copycats. Before he had even found a factory to make his new product, manufacturers in China had spied his idea online, and beaten him to the punch. When his Kickstarter backers caught on, they were furious. “You are charging double the price for what the copycats are charging, yet I seriously doubt the final product will be any better than the copycats,” one person commented. Years ago, experts in the hardware industry would have had more sympathy for Sherman. Now, no one does—not even Sherman himself. While discussions of intellectual property in China’s manufacturing centers once focused on how brands and investors could protect their designs from China’s rapacious copycats, things have changed. Startups and foreign manufacturers are embracing a new reality—someone in China is going to make a knockoff of your unique invention, almost immediately. All any company or entrepreneur can do is prepare for it. The origins of copycat culture China’s knockoffs come in many different forms, and can affect businesses large and small. In some cases, factories will make products that physically resemble ones made by prominent brands. Quality may vary—an Android phone with rounded edges and a stamped-on Apple logo will never come close to replicating the feel of an iPhone. But a counterfeit Gucci bag might easily pass for the real thing. Sometimes, as was the case with Stikbox and the hoverboard, a factory or design team will spot a fledgling new product on the internet, figure out how it’s made, and start churning out near-identical products. Other times, a Chinese partner factory will produce extra units of a product they agreed to make for another company, and sell the surplus items themselves online or to other vendors. Jack Ma, founder of Alibaba, drew criticism when he told investors in June (paywall) that fake goods “are of better quality and of better price than the real names” and come from “exactly the same factories” as authentic goods. But there’s some truth to his comments. Fake goods “are of better quality and of better price than the real names,” Jack Ma said.   Many analysts and historians have attributed Chinese counterfeiting to perceived aspects of Chinese culture like its emphasis on memorization in education, or an authoritarian government that stifles innovation. But rather than these reductions of culture, it has more to do with the evolution of China’s gadget and electronics manufacturing hub of Shenzhen, explains Silvia Lindtner, who researches Chinese entrepreneurship culture at the University of Michigan. The city’s rise throughout the ’90s and early ’00s coincided with a boom in outsourcing among global multinational corporations. Instead of overseeing all the manufacturing of all the parts inside a product, large global hardware companies signed contracts with local manufacturers in Shenzhen to make and design products piecemeal. These contractors would then turn to smaller sub-contractors to help fill orders. Many of the factories involved in these fragmented supply chains were small, family-owned entities operating without government approval. As they worked together, they realized they could do more than just supply parts that ended up in name-brand hardware. They could create rival products on their own, and reach customers who were too poor to buy a Nokia phone or Apple iPod, said Lindtner. They banded together, at times sharing the recipes for specific electronic devices on online message boards. Thus began the shanzhai phenomenon, a word that literally means “mountain fortress,” but came to stand for products that skirt existing intellectual property laws. Phones and consumer electronics with names like “aPod” and “Nokla” flooded the market in the late ’00s. A “<em>shanzhai</em>” iPhone lookalike tablet running (likely a pirated version of) Windows software. (Reuters/Bobby Yip) Open-source manufacturing The shanzhai era in consumer electronics gradually faded as incomes rose and brand-name smartphones became more affordable. But it enforced a culture of knowledge-sharing among manufacturers, wherein no single product design is sacred. Lindtner compares the culture of Shenzhen’s manufacturing ecosystem to the open-source movement among software developers. Much like how programmers will freely share code for others to improve upon, Shenzhen manufacturers now see hardware and product design as something that can be borrowed freely and altered. Success in business comes down to speed and execution, not necessarily originality. “It’s understood that re-iterating or copying is part of the culture, and whoever is better and faster is going to make the deal,” said Lindtner. Nowadays, China’s copycat phenomenon extends well beyond multinational corporations like Gucci or Nokia—startups are affected too. Thanks to the internet, factories and designers looking for the next hit product can easily turn to Kickstarter, Amazon, or Taobao to see what gadgets are hot. They message each other instantly using WeChat, China’s dominant chat app, or Alibaba’s chat software, which makes sourcing and assembly line planning even easier than in the pre-smartphone days.  Factories turn to Kickstarter, Amazon, or Taobao to see what’s hot.   “The whole Chinese system has developed around the idea that you have instantaneous communication and basically infinite information,” said Bunnie Huang, author of The Essential Guide to Electronics in Shenzhen. “Back in the ’80s people were talking about ‘just-in time’ manufacturing” as something to aspire to, he said. “But now, the Chinese don’t even know any other way.” Enforcement is impossible Businesses can take certain legal precautions to reduce the risk of getting copied. A first, crucial step, according to Song Zhu, who litigates IP disputes between US and Chinese firms at California-based law firm Ruyak Cherian LLP, is to apply for utility and design patents for a product that’s valid in the US, China, and anywhere else one hopes to sell. Entrepreneurs should also sign “NNN agreements” with potential Chinese partners before revealing any intellectual property. This contract prevents partner factories from using the intellectual property themselves after first view (“non-use”), sharing it with others (“non-disclosure”), or inking a partnership and then selling extra units on their own (“non-circumvention”). But even with these protections, there’s no guarantee that you can stop someone from copycatting your product. Zhu said that the problem lies not in China’s courts, but enforcing rulings. Winning a case against one factory is relatively easy. But suing every factory and winning is expensive and time consuming.  Suing every factory and winning is expensive and time consuming.  “There are probably hundreds of small factories who might see a product on the internet and think ‘Hey I can do this,” said Zhu. “How are you going to shut down all of them? How can you even find out where they are? And the money you spend suing them is more than you can get out of the lawsuit.” This is now the position Sherman finds himself in with Stikbox. While he hasn’t pursued legal action yet, he said he spends 20% of his time tracking down copycat factories through China’s giant e-commerce sites. It sometimes takes him up to five days to figure out one factory’s location. “The copycat factory doesn’t show its address on Alibaba, only a trading company who represents them. Sometimes you have to track down two or three trading companies before you get to the actual factory,” he told Quartz. Your great idea doesn’t matter The spread of copycat manufacturing isn’t just creating headaches for hardware companies and startups. It’s challenging traditional notions of intellectual property—specifically, what type of ideas are valuable, and what type of ideas are not. Decades ago, a company or entrepreneur might come up with an idea and then spend years securing the patents, completing the design, devising a manufacturing plan, and bringing it to market. Enforceable contracts with partners helped ensure these ideas wouldn’t leak to competitors—but so did the high cost of starting a factory, sourcing components, and managing assembly lines. Moving the world’s manufacturing center to China makes the latter hurdles nearly disappear. Factories are set up in makeshift buildings. Cheap labor is abundant. Sourcing components is easy because of online marketplaces like Alibaba. As a result, smart ideas that are easy to turn into physical products become commoditized quickly. Businesses are now forced to come to terms with this new reality. It’s not enough to create a product with a groundbreaking design or features, like a smartphone case that turns into a selfie stick. Companies dealing in the creation of physical goods now must make products that are impossible to copy exactly from the get go, by focusing on a special feature they can protect, or creating a coveted brand name consumers will pay more for. “If you have a simple product that has some market demand, you will get copied,” said Benjamin Joffe, who works with hardware startups that are manufacturing in China at HAX, a venture capital fund. “The question is more, what do you actually have that’s defensible?” What do you actually have that’s defensible?  Companies can defend themselves from copying by investing in software that complements physical hardware, and then guarding it. Apple, for example, does this with the iPhone, which carries the proprietary iOS operating system that’s unavailable on other phones. Or they can invest in well-crafted branding and marketing. GoPro, for example, has made a name for itself among its target user base of sports and photography enthusiasts. This can help insulate it from competition from Korea’s LG, Xiaomi, and small Chinese knockoff factories. (Sure, there are plenty of fake GoPros out there, but some consumers will pay more for the real thing.) Alternatively, a company can make a product that requires sophisticated manufacturing know-how, so that the average factory wouldn’t bother trying to copy it. Hong Kong-based startup Native Union, for example, created an earpiece for smartphones that looks like an old-fashioned, crescent-shaped landline phone receiver. It was clever, but got copied immediately. Founder Igor Duc later changed the company’s direction and began making a totally different product—smartphone cases made out of Italian marble that sell for $80 each. They’re more difficult to make than the average consumer electronic device, which prevents copycats from surfacing. “When you use complicated raw materials like marble you need to have a lot of expertise about what is good quality, and you need to shave it with a very specific machine,” said Duc. “Whereas a plastic injection is easy to copy, what we do now is more complex.” The bright side of copycats Joffe, the venture capital investor, argues that some companies might even benefit from copycatting, as it can bring more awareness to the product itself. “If you have more customers buying the fake product then it creates more awareness for the real product, and it becomes an aspirational thing. At some point they might be able to afford the real thing.” This is what Sherman reminds himself of, as he scrambles to fulfil orders while his empty-handed Kickstarter backers ponder buying a fake from Taobao instead. “There are other selfie stick cases but we are the only ones that have been copied. So it shows that our product is worth being copied,” he said. “The quote that comes to mind is, ‘Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.’” Yet Sherman estimates that he has lost “hundreds of thousands” of dollars in potential revenue due to copycats. Imitation isn’t just a sincere form of flattery, it’s an expensive one as well. Most Popular Conscious consumerism is a lie.

By Aaron Brown Aaron Brown PUBLISHED: 08:16, Mon, Mar 6, 2017 | UPDATED: 08:16, Mon, Mar 6, 2017 IMRAN TAYLOR • BEHANCE • GETTYApple is expected to pull-out all the stops with its next Apple smartphone, dubbed iPhone 8 Apple is believed to be hard at work on its next flagship smartphone, which will be marketed as either iPhone 8, or iPhone X – due to the smartphone's release celebrating the 10th anniversary of the iPhone. There have already been a steady stream of rumours about the upcoming flagship phone. Apple is expected to introduce a radical new industrial design, with Chief Design Officer Jony Ive purportedly designing the phone so that it resembles "a single sheet of glass". The new smartphone is believed to include a new dual-curved edge-to-edge display. Apple is hotly-tipped to ditch the physical Home Button from the front of the smartphone, so that it can reduce the bezels around the display. But the dramatic changes planned for the next iPhone will simply be surface deep. Apple iPhone 8 - Leaked photos, concept images, and renders Sun, January 1, 2017 iPhone 8 is shaping up to be one of the most impressive Apple smartphones to date, with glass panels on the front and rear of the device, a curved borderless OLED display and no Home Button Play slideshow VENIAMIN GESKIN • TWITTER • CONCEPT IMAGES 1 of 21 Apple iPhone 8 will debut a brand-new all-glass look, with a curved OLED display and no physical Home Button According to a new research note from UBS, Apple has put together a team of more than 1,000 engineers working on Augmented Reality (AR) technology ready for the iPhone. Augmented Reality sees artificial elements – like video footage, CGI animation or GPS data – placed on-top of real-world elements. Pokémon Go is probably the best known example, which lets players use the camera to search for CGI monsters within the world around them. Apple CEO Tim Cook is very interested in AR and has spoken at length about the potential for the technology. “I regard it as a big idea like the smartphone," Mr Cook said in an interview earlier this year. "The smartphone is for everyone, we don’t have to think the iPhone is about a certain demographic or country or vertical market: It’s for everyone. I think AR is that big, it’s huge." GETTYiPhone 7 Plus is the first Apple phone to ship with dual cameras – a feature that could be for AR According to Business Insider, Apple now "may have over 1,000 engineers working on a project in Israel that could be related to AR". The same UBS research note claims Apple will include Augmented Reality technology inside its best-selling smartphone as early as the iPhone 8. If Apple keeps to the same schedule as previous years, iPhone 8 will be launched in September. Renown analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities claims Apple will incorporate the Touch ID fingerprint sensor, usually located in physical Home Button, beneath the glass display in the next iPhone. According to Kuo, the current system Apple uses for its fingerprint recognition functionality will not allow for its revolutionary all-glass design. GETTYApple CEO Tim Cook is a big proponent of Augmented Reality Apple iPhone 7 - you won't believe these pictures have been taken on a smartphone Mon, January 30, 2017 APPLE'S iPhone 7 has an all-new camera and these pictures show off its stunning low light abilities. Play slideshow APPLE 1 of 24 One Night Campaign shot on iPhone Instead, Mr Kuo claims, the new fingerprint sensor will require optical sensors to read the print resting on the display. The complicated new display set-up, which presumably will still need to incorporate the pressure-sensitivity debuted with the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus, will require a number of new, custom solutions from the panel manufacturers. However the KGI Securities research report states that Apple has enough clout within the industry to get the system built ready for the new iPhone. Alongside the new fingerprint recognition technology, the iPhone 8 could also see Apple introduce facial tracking sensors into its flagship smartphone, Mr Kuo has claimed. These could be used to scan users' faces to help verify identification. IMRAN TAYLOR • BEHANCE • CONCEPT OF IPHONE 8The iPhone 8 is widely-tipped to include a new edge-to-edge display Mr Kuo believes the fingerprint recognition system will "ultimately be replaced by a facial recognition system" in an effort to make the iPhone even more secure. "However, if the technical challenges cannot be overcome, we believe a combination of fingerprint and facial recognition is another possible solution," he writes. Elsewhere, Apple is reportedly looking to distance itself from the curved aluminium design language it has used for the past three generations of iPhone, first introduced with iPhone 6. With the Home Button gone, Apple can extended the display to the bottom of the phone – reducing the chunky bezels around the screen, and shrinking the overall footprint of the device. The new 10th anniversary edition of the iPhone is also expected to be modelled with an all-glass design, similar to the iPhone 4 and 4S. Apple is expected to debut its new industrial design language early next year with a refresh of its iPad range.

Assuming you weren’t born last year, you’re undoubtedly familiar with Apple’s famous ad campaign. Running from 2006-2009, the campaign pit a “hip” Justin Long against an “uptight and nerdy” John Hodgman. Over that time Apple accomplished two things: Confusing the entire world. A Mac is a PC. Made Justin Long look cool. Well done. Ever been to a tech festival? TNW Conference won best European Event 2016 for our festival vibe. See what's in store for 2017. LEARN MORE You might also think this started the whole Mac vs PC debate. You’d be wrong. Apple and Microsoft fanboys have been around for decades, and the debate over which is better starts with the origin of each company. Specifically, who copied whom when it came to delivering their respective operating systems. Luckily, Bill Gates knows a thing or two. During his Reddit AMA, Gates did his part to put at least part of the debate to rest for good. When asked about copying, Gates was quick to point out that he and Steve Jobs both copied. But not from each other. From Xerox. Gates said: The main ‘copying’ that went on relative to Steve and me is that we both benefited from the work that Xerox Parc did in creating graphical interface – it wasn’t just them but they did the best work. Steve hired Bob Belville, I hired Charles Simonyi. We didn’t violate any IP rights Xerox had but their work showed the way that led to the Mac and Windows. There you have it, fanboys. If you’re still pissed about Apple/Microsoft copying the work of the other it’s time to put it to rest. Xerox fans, it’s time to revolt.

Yet one of the smallest start-ups there, Lumos – with nine staff in Hong Kong and Shenzhen and headquarters the size of a single parking space – recently did the unthinkable, defeating the US$40 billion Tesla in an international design competition. The Lumos smart cycling helmet edged out the latest Tesla Model 3 to win the Beazley Design of the Year awarded by the Design Museum in the United Kingdom in the transport category. “Tesla was one of the companies I admire the most, so that was very meaningful to me,” Eu-wen Ding, CEO and co-founder of Lumos, told the Post. But his role model is not Elon Musk, founder of Tesla. “Everyone looks to Apple and Steve Jobs as their hero. We want to be the Apple of our category.” Its category is cycling safety accessories. The winning idea was to have LED left/right/stopping lights visible on the back of a helmet. With a built-in accelerometer, Lumos detects when a cyclist is slowing down and automatically displays a brake light and turn signals, allowing vehicles behind to know the intention of the cyclist and reduce the chances of a collision. Ding felt it solved “a real, very obvious problem in a hopefully elegant and well-designed way”. The prize was perhaps the biggest triumph so far for Ding, 31, who took a gamble when he decided to quit a Harvard University MBA programme half way about two years ago. Ding, a mechanical engineer who used to cycle to study and work in Boston and San Francisco, said he kept a list of ideas in his notebook, including a helmet with lights. “What I love doing is to build things that I think are really interesting.” He teamed up with co-founder Jeff Chen Hao-ren from Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, who was at Harvard as a visiting student, to start the business by designing, making and marketing cycling helmets. They could have chosen to start the business in other places, such as the US where the two founders met), Singapore (where Ding comes from), or mainland China (where Chen is from). But they decided to build the business from Hong Kong, for reasons that illustrate the city’s attractiveness as a place for innovation start-ups. “Hong Kong is the middle ground. Our engineering team and manufacturing are in Shenzhen and we need to go there weekly, and our main market is North America,” Ding explained. “Most of our marketing is done online by Facebook and Google, which are not available in China.” Hong Kong student helps turn bright idea into a safer bicycle helmet And Science Park offers a helping hand too. “Our rent here is about HK$2,500 per month for our office that can sit six people,” Ding said. While Lumos has already overachieved in its crowdfunding by raising US$800,000, it needs further funding to achieve its ambitions. Ding admitted there was a lot of hard work between designing a good product and making it in the market, although he said the company was already “operationally profitable”. A survey by InvestHK found there were 1,926 start-ups in the city in 2016. A study in 2015 by the San Francisco-based research firm Compass found Hong Kong to be the 5th fastest growing start-up ecosystem globally. How Hong Kong can join the global pursuit for truly useful technology Albert Wong, CEO of Science Park, said: “There are already a number of successful technology start-ups in Hong Kong, such as bio-tech firm Vitargent, Insight Robotics and logistics company Lalamove. They have achieved impressive footprint in the global market place. “One of the most important needs of start-up companies is to get sufficient funding support.” Funding remains one of the biggest challenges for start-ups. Ben Chan Han-pan, a member of the Legislative Council’s panel on information technology and broadcasting, said: “Hong Kong still lags behind in terms of angel funding, the money that venture capitals put into promising start-ups. The lack of government support is also an issue.” Eric Mak, head of Sunlight Eco-tech, said one of the biggest difficulties was the risk-averse nature of government funding. “The process of government funding is bureaucratic and against the spirit of innovation,” he said. “The process of innovation is long and painful. Start-ups always face risks, and the government doesn’t want to support anything risky. “But that is the price to pay to create a concrete innovative technology sector.” This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: Start-up firm enjoying the ride in Hong kong   Most Popular Viewed 1 Hong Kong the most expensive Asian city to build anything in, survey reveals 2 Malaysia’s PM says North Korea is holding citizens hostage 3 Cathay Pacific training flight makes emergency return to HK 4 Is murder of Kim Jong-nam forcing China’s hand against North Korea? 5 Death by a thousand job cuts: the human cost of China’s zombie firms Shared 1 Hong Kong the most expensive Asian city to build anything in, survey reveals 2 Banned shark fins ‘discovered’ in cargo of freight companies 3 How China’s Airbnb clones went from copycats to copied 4 Malaysia’s PM says North Korea is holding citizens hostage 5 Cathay Pacific training flight makes emergency return to HK Commented 1 Hong Kong chief executive sues lawmaker for defamation 2 Three donations to jailed Hong Kong policemen’s fund rejected 3 Police round up 11 thought to have helped mainlanders get UK visas 4 Hong Kong the most expensive Asian city to build anything in, survey reveals 5 Police urged to reject ‘questionable’ cash for jailed officers’ families       You may also like China Beijing pledges more tax cuts ... but can they jump-start China’s economy? 6 Mar 2017 - 11:23pm 5 Useful gadgets?

Rating: 4 out of 5 Written by Swapnil Mathur | Updated: March 6, 2017 11:49 am Sony NW-A35 is quiet a compact little device with a small touchscreen to help you navigate your music library. There was once a time when Sony was considered the king of audio products. It was “cool” to be seen with a Sony Walkman, their ostentatious music systems that loudly proclaimed 2000 watts of output were a staple in almost every household. Then the iPod happened. Apple’s portable music player single-handedly killed not just every other portable audio product in the market, but also started a digital revolution, where people moved away from cassettes and CDs in favour of mp3 files. Now we listen to music through our phones and over the years, the quality of the audio experience has only deteriorated. Going from CDs to compressed mp3’s to streaming music that’s optimised for poor bandwidth, there’s not a lot out there that would appease an audiophile. Enter Sony and its attempt to regain the hearts of music lovers with their line of high-resolution audio players. Watch all our videos from Express Technology Specifications: 3.1 inch 800×400 TFT colour display | 16GB on-board storage (expandable to 128GB) | weighs 98 grams | Physical playback buttons |Proprietary multi-function port | Price: 15,990 Sony NW-A35 Walkman Sony claims that thanks to the built-in Digital Sound Enhancement Engine, the player is able to scale the resolution of an audio file by up to three times the fidelity. The Sony NW-A35 Walkman is the newest addition to the company’s small portfolio of dedicated, high-resolution audio players. The NW-A35 is quiet a compact little device with a small touchscreen to help you navigate your music library. It weighs just enough to feel hefty and sturdy, without seeming heavy. We reviewed the portable music player to see if it made any sense to carry an additional device just to play music. Through our review, we used multiple earphones and headphones, used both mp3 and high-resolution audio and tested playback quality on various devices. Sony claims while the NW-A35 can play high resolution files in their true fidelity, where the layer shines is in upscaling the quality of mp3 files. Sony claims that thanks to the built-in Digital Sound Enhancement Engine, the player is able to scale the resolution of an audio file by up to three times the fidelity. The feature does have its limitations, in the form that if you’re trying to upscale mp3 files with a 128kbps bitrate, the mode isn’t going to automatically turn the file into a superior file. There’s a lot going on with the NW-A35, so we’ll just break down the essentials for you What’s good?  Sony claims that thanks to the built-in Digital Sound Enhancement Engine, the player is able to scale the resolution of an audio file by up to three times the fidelity. The NW-A35 supports a multitude of file formats such as AAC (Non-DRM), AIFF, ALAC, DSD, FLAC, HE-AAC, Linear PCM, MP3, WMA (Non-DRM). If you’re an avid music listener, chances are you’re either listening to mp3 or Apple’s AAC formats. For anyone with a serious love for listening to music, the support for DSD, FLAC and ALAC formats is a blessing. It is likely that your Android phone supports these formats too, but  the hardware inside the NW-A35 is what really extracts the most out of audio files. In order to test the Sony NW-A35 Walkman, we used over seven different earphones and headphones to compare the audio coming out of the Walkman with the output of a OnePlus 3T, a Google Pixel XL and an iPhone 7. We played back FLAC files (16bit-44KHz and 24bit-96KHz), mp3 files (ripped from CD at 320kbps, constant bitrate). Consistently, the NW-A35 sounded noticeably better across all formats. While we expected better FLAC playback, turning on the DSEE mode for enhancement of files that weren’t high resolution audio files also enhanced the quality of the music. They even bring back the old “hold” button which disables the physical buttons to avoid any changes due to accidental pushes. The other thing that we really liked was the physical playback controls. If you’re the kind of listener who would put something on and then let the playlist progress on its own, you’re going to get a lot of mileage out of the battery. If you prefer to occasionally skip, pause or repeat a track, the Sony NW-A35 has physical buttons for all that and even for adjusting volume. They even bring back the old “hold” button which disables the physical buttons to avoid any changes due to accidental pushes. In our test, we peaked the battery life at about 19 hours of playback with mixed media files. Lastly, the Walkman also comes equipped with NFC and Bluetooth for easily connecting wireless speakers or earphones. We tested this feature out with Sony’s own XB50BS Bluetooth earphones. Connecting using NFC was easy and playback was strong throughout our use. There were no skips, but this could be attributed to the Walkman never being more than 4 feet away from the earphone. The quality of the audio was not as great as we got from wired earphones and headphones, so we’d honestly recommend skipping the NW-A35 if your primary need is wireless playback. What’s not so good?  The touchscreen was occasionally non-responsive, sometimes scrolling through songs wasn’t seamless and the software as a whole. ( Source: Press photo) While the Sony NW-A50 excels as a music player, we encountered some issues with it as a holistic device. For starters, the touchscreen was occasionally non-responsive, sometimes scrolling through songs wasn’t seamless and the software as a whole could use some improvement. Our second issue with the NW-A35 is the fact that it comes with just 16GB of on-board storage and if you’ve got a library of FLAC files, you’re going to be annoyed by this. We had to add a 32GB microSD card to the Walkman in order to fit our library onto it. It’s a shame that Sony doesn’t bundle a microSD card with this otherwise excellent Walkman. Speaking of things not being bundled, the Sony NW-A35 Walkman comes as a standalone device, that is, there are no earphones in the box. We were disappointed to see that there’s no case, pouch or even a screen protector in the box. In comparison, the MDR-EX750NA (noise cancelling high-resolution earbuds) that cost less than the Walkman, come with a carrying pouch. We feel that for a device that costs Rs 15,990, a screen protector or a carrying pouch would have been a nice touch. Who should buy it, Who should steer clear? High-resolution audio players, as much as we’d like them to be a staple in everyone’s hands, are not so. This Walkman is a great tool for anyone who really enjoys the experience of good quality music. What that means is if you enjoy listening to the intricacies of instrument arrangement, or want to hear music the way the musician intended it to be heard, you’re going to need FLAC files and the NW-A35 will help you get the most out of them. You should be ready to invest in some good earphones or headphones as well because listening to high-resolution audio on bad earphones/headphones is like trying to drive a Ferrari through the busy streets of Chandni Chowk. You don’t need to go overboard with expensive equipment, but a decent pair of buds will definitely help you get more out of your player. If you’re the kind of person who would download low-quality audio files ripped from streaming websites, the NW-A35 can’t do anything to improve your audio experience. If you’re okay with streaming music from various services, then the NW-A35 can’t do anything for you as it cannot stream music. The Sony NW-A35 Walkman is a device not for everyone. Those who listen to music for recreation, as active listeners are the ones who would benefit from being able to enjoy higher fidelity music than their phones are capable of delivering (maybe except for the LG V20). For the price, the Walkman is good value for money. However, we wish that it had come with at least a carrying pouch, and a decent pair of earbuds. © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd Tags: Sony Election 2017 UP polls 2017: In his last appeal, Modi talks jobs, empowerment for farmers UP polls 2017: In this village of soldiers, families that lost sons can’t agree on Army and strikes UP elections 2017: At ghats, they revel in arguing about Ganga, politics and Modi Best of Express SportsIndia vs Australia Live Score EntertainmentNoor trailer: Sonakshi Sinha says Mumbai is killing her.

(BigStock Image) More schools are using tablets and laptops in classrooms than ever before, and, in the U.S., Google is leading the charge. Last year, more 12.6 million mobile devices were shipped to schools around the United States. Google Chromebooks accounted for more than half of those, while Microsoft and Apple fell behind, according to a new report by Futuresource Consulting. Google’s growth in the U.S. education technology sector has been quick as well – in 2013, Chromebooks only made up 38 percent of the market. (Futuresource Image) Google’s grip on the education market can be largely attributed to price. Chromebooks remain the most affordable option for schools, with devices costing as low as $120 in some cases. This price point makes them more appealing for schools that have to worry about devices getting lost or broken. Other technology companies now have to lower their price to remain competitive. In January, Microsoft announced Windows 10-powered partner devices that will cost as little as $189. These devices will include the recently launched Microsoft Classroom and the central Microsoft management platform Intune for Education. A cloud-based device management system has been Google’s edge in the sector. It allows schools to easily set up students’ devices remotely and means students can store documents in the cloud and access them from whichever device is nearby. Chromebooks also feature the G Suite productivity tools and Google Classroom.  Microsoft has made huge strides in developing its education ecosystem offering in the past year, with major announcements on both the devices and platform side. Mike Fisher, Futuresource’s associate director of education, said that, while Microsoft is improving its education tools, schools continue to prefer Google’s platform because of its simplicity. “Microsoft has made huge strides in developing its education ecosystem offering in the past year, with major announcements on both the devices and platform side,” Fisher said in a news release. “To date however, these developments have not stopped Google’s momentum within the US K-12 market. Microsoft continues to face challenges to win back end-user mindshare.” In classrooms abroad, however, it’s a different story. Microsoft dominates the international education sector, accounting for 65 percent of all mobile device sales abroad last year. Overall device sales to schools outside of the U.S. fell 26 percent last year, with only 13.6 million units sold. This likely is due to a variety of factors, Futuresource said, including fewer national projects focused on deploying mobile devices. Microsoft led the market in international mobile device sales to schools, with Google coming in at less than 30 percent. Much of Google’s and Microsoft’s growth has come at the expense of Apple, which has seen a significant decrease in its grip on the education market. In the last three years, sales of iPads to classrooms have steadily fallen. Apple devices accounted for only 14 percent sales in the U.S. in 2016. While iPads have long appealed to classrooms with younger children, older students need keyboards to do work. Apple doesn’t offer an affordable option in that area. Microsoft and Google, however, are creating 2-in-1 products that feature a keyboard and stylus for under $300. Overall, Futuresource notes in the report, this competition between companies has made mobile devices more accessible to schools. “PC provider’s laser focus on the education sector is good news for schools and students,” Fisher said. “2017 will see wide ranges of computing devices, designed specifically for education and at competitive price points, entering the market and vying to be the device of choice for learning.” Jillian Stampher is a journalist based out of Seattle with a focus on breaking news reporting and digital media.

But at this year’s proceedings, the artificially intelligent voice-based service struggled to be heard above the din of an army of rival assistants that will soon jostle for attention on smartphones. As the event kicked off Sunday, the search giant announced the Google Assistant would ship on all new phones running its popular Android operating system. The same day, Motorola said its latest Android phones would come with Amazon.com Inc.’s Alexa voice-based helper, Google’s nemesis. Executives at Motorola parent Lenovo Group Ltd. explained later that consumers who buy the latest Motorola phones can use both Alexa and Google’s assistant. Soon, they’ll even have a third option: the Chinese manufacturer plans to roll out its own AI-powered service on its devices this year. “I don’t really believe in the supremacy of one assistant,” Lenovo Vice President of Product Dan Dery said in an interview, describing the plan as “bringing AI to hardware.” Google’s version represents one of the company’s biggest bets since it began building a novel web search engine in 1998. It wants to remain the main source of digital information as people talk to their computers more, rather than type. That will require its assistant to be on as many gadgets as possible. But Google’s hardware partners are also betting voice-based computing could be the next big thing, rivalling the mobile boom. VoiceLabs estimates 24.5 million voice-based devices will ship this year in the US, up from 6.5 million in 2016. Amazon leads, while Google is trying to catch up quickly. There’s also a rush to deploy AI techniques, resulting in a Mobile World Congress awash in digital helpers. South Korea’s SK Telecom Co. displayed “Nugu,” an internet-connected speaker akin to Amazon’s Alexa-powered Echo. Line Corp. introduced “Clova.” Deutsche Telekom AG had “Tinka,” a customer service chat bot.  Last month, HTC Corp. introduced Sense Companion, a personal companion service with voice-recognition, on its newest Android phone. Even Will.i.am, a hip hop star-turned-tech-entrepreneur, is working on an assistant. When a reporter asked for a demonstration at the conference, the service struggled to follow commands.  Aside from Apple Inc., smartphone makers have largely failed to wring profit from software-based services and lessen their dependence on hardware businesses beset by shrinking margins. Samsung Electronics Co. built its own mobile operating system, with little success, and Samsung Pay vies for mobile purchases with Google’s Android Pay on many smartphones. Samsung is trying again with assistants. In the fall, it acquired Viv Labs, a startup formed by the creators of Apple’s Siri assistant, and is expected to release a digital helper with its newest phone in March. Android chief Hiroshi Lockheimer denied these efforts undercut Google’s assistant. ”A lot of [original equipment manufacturers] will choose to do that because they see value in assistants,” he said in Barcelona. “Competition is good.”  Privately, other Google employees said they are less concerned that hardware or telecom companies will build a better digital assistant. Google’s search engine provides ready answers to millions of questions for its voice-based service, and the company has thousands of skilled engineers working on the project — resources that these other firms may struggle to match. A larger concern is Amazon. The e-commerce giant has built a network of software development partners for Alexa, a service that, like Amazon’s flagship online shopping service, could dent Google’s core business of finding and delivering information. If Alexa is on a lot of Android phones, alongside the Google Assistant, which service will answer when people ask their devices valuable questions like which nearby restaurant to book or what holiday gifts to buy? In January, Amazon announced it was bringing the service to Huawei Technologies Inc. phones sold outside of China. Then came Lenovo at MWC. The story of the Chinese company’s Motorola division is a painfully familiar tale for anyone involved in Android. While it’s the most popular software for running phones, Android manufacturers have struggled to make money on hardware, while Google scoops up billions of dollars from mobile services and related ads flowing through the devices.  Lenovo bought the Motorola hardware business from Google in 2014 and the integration has been tough: in the third quarter, Lenovo reported a US$112 million (RM499 million) loss from its mobile division, compared with US$30 million a year earlier. Dery, a former Motorola Vice President who returned to the brand in July, is tasked with breathing new life into the business.  Digital assistants are key to his plan. Lenovo’s coming voice-based service will rely on a personal identifier attached to all users of its hardware, allowing it to work consistently across Lenovo phones, tablets, desktop and laptop computers, said Dery. Dery described this as a supplement to the assistants from Amazon and Google. While those two services mostly respond to queries and commands, Lenovo’s will send notifications and alerts based on predictions about users’ behaviour and needs, according to the executive. “We don’t like to call it an assistant because it’s misleading in a way,” he said. “This is something which is always aware, in the background, syncing for you.”  By Dery’s telling, Amazon was quite pleased to hear about his broader AI strategy. “We shared that whole plan with Amazon and they realised, ‘Wow, this is exactly the missing piece for putting Alexa in everyone’s pocket,’” he said. Google wasn’t upset by the move either, he insisted. “They know our plan as well,” Dery said.Still, the more digital assistants get crammed into devices, the more crowding for Google. — Bloomberg                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week From voice to written notes via Ukrainian Senstone device (VIDEO) Google vows fix for ‘inappropriate’ search results Consumer Reports to consider cyber security in product reviews ‘Pokemon Go’ player dies from heart attack after catching rare Lapras in Singapore China’s TCL brings back physical keyboard in new BlackBerry China’s TCL brings back physical keyboard in new BlackBerry Apple ‘spaceship’ headquarters readies for boarding Google adds new languages, voice dictation to its iPhone keyboard ‘Pokemon Go’ player dies from heart attack after catching rare Lapras in Singapore Axiata Digital, Huawei sign MoU to bring Internet of Things capabilities across Asia Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Related Articles Google vows fix for ‘inappropriate’ search results Five trends at Mobile World Congress Spotify hits 50 million paid subscribers, lifting music industry Amazon reveals 2017 pilot season lineup Ancient human tree cultivation shaped Amazon landscape Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

Apple’s got an iOS 10.3 update in beta and it will bring more than just bug fixes and security patches to iOS 10 users. It’s loaded up with new features including a new Find My AirPods options, AFPS (Apple File System), and Verizon Wi-Fi calling for iCloud-connected devices. The company hasn’t confirmed an iOS 10.3 release date just yet but we, and many others, are expecting it to make its debut alongside new hardware at an Apple launch event. Last March, the company confirmed the iOS 9.3 release date alongside its iPhone SE and a new 9.7-inch iPad Pro. With the iOS 10.3 beta making significant progress (we’re now on beta 4 and seeing simultaneous releases for developers and the public) and the release getting close, we want to help you prepare for Apple’s iOS 10.3 release. You’ll want to start by avoiding some of these mistakes on release day. Here are a few rules of thumb and you’ll want to keep these in mind as we push into March. Get Familiar with iOS 10.3 Right Now   1 / 5 If you haven't dug into the many changes coming with the iOS 10.3 update, now would be a great time to do so.  Blindly installing iOS updates isn't wise and it's a mistake many iPhone and iPad users make when a new iOS update is released. You don't want to be caught off guard by any of the changes the update brings to your device.  This is where the iOS 10.3 beta comes in handy. Those of us testing the early version of iOS 10.3 have discovered a long list of changes coming with the upgrade.  So far, most of the changes appear to be solid. That said, there are some small tweaks that have the potential to annoy you if you aren't prepared. For instance, there are some huge UI changes to CarPlay that you'll want to get familiar with before the iOS 10.3 update arrives. That's just one example.  iOS 10.3 is packed with changes, big and small, and we highly recommend getting acquainted with them before the update arrives and/or before you install iOS 10.3 on your phone.  We also recommend digging into early feedback about iOS 10.3's performance on your device. This could alert you to potential benefits, and issues, ahead of the iOS 10.3 release date.    1 / 5 One Response 03/03/2017 Jim Boarman Reply Unbelievable article!! Adam Mills, a journalism major, who bought an iPhone and iPad, has used them for a few years, is now smarter and more knowledgable than all the software engineers, programmers and managers thereof at Apple regarding software updates and new OS versions for your iPhone. Adam, do you really think Apple designs software updates without considering what impact it will have on current users? Your statement “Blindly installing iOS updates isn’t wise…”, is pompous and specious. People in the medical, engineering, legal, accounting, etc., fields that require prerequisite education and registrations get put in jail for masquerading as something they are not; because they are a danger to society. You fall into this category, however, because anyone that knows how to type can do what you do, unfortunately there are no laws against it. As I have asked you many times before, please get a job doing something you know about. IT is not that area!! Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

Spotify has done just that. The Swedish-based music streaming service has become the first to pass the 50 million paying customers mark after adding 10 million subscribers in less than six months. The sudden burst of new downloaders has kept the company ahead of its closest rival, Apple Music, which had about 20 million subscribers by December 2016, some 18 months after launch. In the UK, where the service costs £10 a month, Rihanna was the most streamed female artist in 2016, as well as worldwide, with 2.5 billion streams, finishing ahead of Sia, the Australian singer, songwriter, record producer and video music director.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Business Image Source: HOSLET/EPA/REX/Shutterstock Bill Gates just solved the very first Apple vs. Microsoft fanboy debate Zach Epstein @zacharye February 28th, 2017 at 12:38 PM Share Tweet Back before iOS and Android were even a glimmer in anyone’s eye, there was another fanboy rivalry that, at times, was even more heated than the bizarre debates over smartphone allegiance we see today. It’s crazy to think that any fanboy arguments could be more intense than the clashes seen all over the web between Android addicts and iPhone lovers, but it’s true. Apple and Microsoft each played a key role in the proliferation of personal computers, and both brands formed very loyal fan bases that constantly bickered about which company was superior. They argued over nearly every topic you can imagine, but the very first Apple vs. Microsoft fanboy debate focused on one question in particular: When it comes to the companies’ very first graphical user interfaces, who copied whom? Well, after decades of back and forth, we finally have an answer — and it comes straight from the horse’s mouth. Don't Miss: WSJ says iPhone 8 will have a curved display, but I’m not buying it On Monday, Microsoft cofounder, renowned philanthropist and all-around awesome guy Bill Gates conducted his fifth “Ask Me Anything” session on Reddit, where he has become something of a hero. For those somehow unaware of Reddit’s popular AMA series, these threads are conducted by a person or group, typically in the public eye, and they encourage users on the site to ask any questions they want. Gates’s fifth AMA was wildly popular, of course, and more than 17,000 comments were ultimately posted in the thread. We could spend weeks talking about all of the great answers Gates provided, but one was of particular interest in the context of this site. Reddit user HalesOwnShrek asked this brief question: “Did you copy Steve Jobs or did he copy you?” The question was brief indeed, but it’s based on decades of back and forth between Apple and Microsoft fans. Gates took the time to respond, and his response puts an end to the debate once and for all. “The main ‘copying’ that went on relative to Steve and me is that we both benefited from the work that Xerox Parc did in creating graphical interface – it wasn’t just them but they did the best work,” Gates wrote on Reddit. “Steve hired Bob Belville, I hired Charles Simonyi. We didn’t violate any IP rights Xerox had but their work showed the way that led to the Mac and Windows.” So there you have it, fanboys. The debate is over. When it comes to the companies’ original GUIs, Microsoft didn’t copy Apple and Apple didn’t copy Microsoft. They both copied Xerox.

As much as Amazon's (AMZN)  Echo home speaker/voice assistant has turned into a surprise hit and yielded a blizzard of positive media attention, the Alexa voice assistant powering Echo hardware is still in key respects at a strategic disadvantage relative to Alphabet/Google (GOOGL) , Apple (AAPL) , and Microsoft's (MSFT)  rival offerings. Google and Apple's assistants each shipped with hundreds of millions of mobile devices last year, and Microsoft's perhaps on close to 200 million PCs. By contrast, Echo sales (judging by estimates) were likely only in seven figures. In theory, that would leave Google/Apple much better-positioned to create powerful third-party ecosystems for their assistants, as well as to optimize them in response to user voice commands. In practice, Amazon's all-out push to both improve Alexa and place it within as many devices as possible is making for a very interesting battle. Earlier this week, Lenovo's Motorola Mobility unit announced it plans to bundle Alexa with "most" of its phones going forward. Since then, Re/code has reported Amazon plans to launch one or two Alexa devices this year that will "allow people to initiate phone calls by voice," as well as let multiple devices function as a home or office's intercom system. And Amazon hardware news site AFTVnews has come across an image on Amazon's site that suggests the company plans to launch a home security camera with Alexa built in. All of this comes less than two months after dozens of Alexa-powered devices were shown off at CES by companies not named Amazon. These included Alexa-powered speakers, robots, refrigerators, TV sets and alarm clocks, as well as a Huawei Android phone. In addition, dozens of home electronics and appliance makers announced that their latest products can be controlled via Alexa. That last fact underscores how successful Amazon has been at creating a giant hardware, app and Internet service ecosystem for Alexa. At CES, Amazon announced Alexa now supports over 7,000 third-party "skills," up from just 1,000 last June. They cover everything from playing games to ordering Uber rides and Domino's pizzas to controlling home lights and thermostats to hearing sports scores and news stories. Google and Apple have taken a slower approach to building out their voice assistant ecosystems. Some Android developers have taken advantage of Google's Voice Interactions API, which launched in 2015 and lets users issue voice commands for third-party Android apps. And in December, Google Assistant, the next-gen service that evolved from the older Google Now, was opened up to developers. But currently, developers can only support interactions with the Google Home speaker. Android phone support will arrive later. Apple finally opened up Siri to developers last June, after having previously integrated the assistant with a handful of third-party apps. But for now, only six types of apps -- calling, messaging, payments, photo, workout and ride-hailing apps -- are supported. Apple has also seen a measure of adoption for its HomeKit platform, which launched in 2014 and allows smart home devices to be controlled via Siri commands. However, launches of Alexa-capable smart home products have been outpacing those of HomeKit-capable products, thanks in no small part to the fact that Apple places much stricter requirements on hardware partners than does Amazon. Amazon, meanwhile, seems intent on spending and partnering its way to success. Last May, Jeff Bezos said Amazon had over 1,000 people working on Alexa and the Echo line. A LinkedIn job search for "Amazon Alexa" currently turns up 896 openings at Amazon and a pair of subsidiaries. A search for "Amazon artificial intelligence" turns up 157 openings at the company, including many for Alexa units. That said, Google still appears to be a very formidable rival. In addition to being able to bundle Assistant with the world's most popular mobile operating system, the company's ability to integrate Assistant with Google Search and its massive Knowledge Graph, as well as with other Google services such as Maps and Gmail, is a valuable advantage. So are its tremendous AI investments, which help with things like maintaining a conversation with a user and understanding the meaning of natural-language commands. Apple, on the other hand, might be in a tougher spot. While Siri is guaranteed to maintain a large user base as long as it remains built into Apple hardware, even many Apple fans have been complaining it has been falling behind its rivals in both accuracy and functionality. And unlike Alexa or Google Assistant, it's unlikely that Siri will be baked into third-party smart home devices, given Apple's product philosophy. The stakes in this battle are pretty high, as more and more consumers warm to voice as a computing interface. Though they'll never fully replace the use of touchscreens, keyboards and mice, the enhancements (via AI algorithms and other means) made to voice search and assistant platforms as they take in more user data, along with their growing usefulness as more products and services join an ecosystem, is clearly producing a sea change. In May, Google disclosed a fifth of all the searches it handled via its mobile app and Android devices involved voice. For Google, the rise of voice presents some monetization challenges, since it can lower the number of times a user making a query sees the text-based search ads that remain by far Google's biggest profit engine. But the company is clearly better off embracing the trend with a service that integrates Google Search -- and in many cases turns up a search results page to go with a voice reply -- rather than ceding the space to rival services. Google, for its part, argues that a lot of voice search activity complements rather than cannibalizes text-based searches, and thus expands its addressable market. Amazon, meanwhile, benefits from Alexa's growing popularity both via hardware sales and the integration of its e-commerce and digital content services with the platform. Indeed, it might be a little too easy to place an Amazon order via Alexa. In addition, Amazon Web Services (AWS) powers many third-party Alexa Skills through its AWS Lambda service, though it's also possible for developers to use another cloud provider. Given what we've seen over the first couple months of the year, it's likely many more home and mobile devices featuring Alexa will be unveiled over the next 10. It's also likely that makers of smart home products will start to treat Alexa integration as no-brainer, and that the number of total skills supported by the platform will surge past 10,000. This is a battle where Amazon, ironically, has been more of a plucky upstart than an entrenched giant. But it can no longer be considered much of an underdog.

Spurned beau Juan Thompson, 31, of Missouri was arrested in his home city of St. Louis and slapped with cyberstalking charges after a months-long crusade of bomb threats, the feds said. Thompson — a former online investigative reporter for The Intercept who got the boot there for creating fake news — is accused of making at least eight threatening calls to Jewish Community Centers in Manhattan, Dallas, Michigan and San Diego. SEE ALSO Disgraced journalist threatened Jewish centers to get back at ex: FBI 0:0 A disgraced Missouri reporter has been busted for unleashing a... He also sent an e-mail warning of an upcoming “Jewish Newtown’’ — masquerading as his 32-year-old former gal pal when he sent it to try to get her in trouble for supposedly lying about him, officials said. Authorities said they believe Thompson got the idea to target Jewish organizations simply after seeing news reports of scores of other anti-Semitic threats called in since the beginning of the year. Ian D’Emilia, Thompson’s former roommate at Vassar College, told The Post that he was surprised the suspect had targeted Jewish people. “He was dating a Jewish girl at Vassar,’’ said D’Emilia, 26, of Haddonfield, NJ. That woman was not the Brooklyn girlfriend who jilted him. D’Emilia added, “we both had senses of humor that were sometimes off-color. He said it was good that he was dating [the girl] because he needed to date a white woman and she was Jewish and her family had money. But I took those comments in the spirit of he was joking around.” Thompson briefly appeared in court Friday afternoon wearing khakis, boots and a button-down blue shirt. He was shackled at the wrists and ankles, according to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. The former reporter had been fired from The Intercept in January 2016 and then got his walking papers from his Brooklyn girlfriend in July. The day after she broke up with him, Thompson allegedly began terrorizing her, spewing hate-fueled e-mails and faxes to her employer accusing her of drunken driving and spreading STDs. He sent her naked photos of herself and threatened to make them public, authorities said. He anonymously contacted a national children’s welfare organization, lying that she had kiddie porn on her phone, the feds said. When NYPD detectives later spoke to Thompson on Nov. 22 about the accusations, he reportedly claimed to have been hacked. On Feb. 7, Thompson sent an e-mail from an anonymous account to a Manhattan JCC — using his own name and birthdate in the attempt to trick authorities into thinking his ex was trying to frame him, according to a federal criminal complaint filed by the US Attorney’s Office in Manhattan. “Juan Thompson [birthday] put two bombs in the office of the Jewish center today,” the e-mail allegedly read. SEE ALSO Arrest made in connection with bomb threats at Jewish centers 0:0 A man has been arrested in connection with phoning in... “He wants to create Jewish newtown tomorrow,” it said, referring to the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre in Newtown, Conn. Thompson made a similar bomb threat to the Jewish History Museum in Manhattan, authorities said. Thompson also most recently sent an e-mail from an anonymous account to the Anti-Defamation League’s nation office in Midtown Manhattan last month, saying his girlfriend was behind the bomb threats, officials said. “She lives in nyc and is making more bomb threats tomorrow,” the e-mail read. Thompson’s hate spree allegedly made it across the country. On Feb. 20, a JCC in San Diego received an e-mail claiming that the disgraced journalist’s ex had planted a bomb inside the building in hopes of killing “as many Jews asap,” the Dispatch reported. Weeks earlier, a Jewish school in Farmington Hills, Mich., got a call from Thompson saying he had placed two bombs somewhere inside, officials said. But as late as last week, Thompson, who is black, was still claiming that it was all his white girlfriend’s evil handiwork, authorities said. The Jewish Community Center on Amsterdam Avenue.Gabi Porter He allegedly seethed on Twitter that his ex “seemed like a cool Brooklyn white radical. There [were] warning signs though. “She didn’t tell me she had herpes until AFTER we hooked up . . . and she called herself captain save-a-thug — a reference to the type of black men she dated.” At one point, he allegedly posted her name, photo, telephone number and home address online. She works for a Manhattan non-profit. Thompson’s next court appearance is set for Wednesday. The judge is expected to decide if he will be transferred to New York to face charges. D’Emilia, his former roommate, described Thompson as charismatic, intelligent and funny — although also an oddball. For example, he said Thompson wouldn’t tell anyone his age. After Thompson’s fraudulent reporting was spotlighted in an in-depth piece by Riverfront Times reporter Doyle Murphy in February 2016, two local reporters received an anonymous e-mail from someone claiming that Murphy had committed a crime against her. No evidence was ever found to support the claim.

Live Watch Steve Jobs Kept Private Life Closely Guarded Secret By Colleen Curry Close More from Colleen Oct. 6, 2011 0 Shares Email Star PlayABCNEWS.com WATCH Steve Jobs in 60 Seconds 0 Shares Email Though he was one of the world's most famous CEOs, Steve Jobs kept his private world -- wife and family, illegitimate daughter, father who gave him up for adoption, long lost sister -- hidden from public view. Since the founding of Apple Computer in 1976, fans and the media grasped for any hint at the personal life of the man in the black turtleneck, trying to piece together what they could of the reclusive innovator. PHOTOS: Steve Jobs Through The Years But Jobs was so successful at keeping the details of his life out of the celebrity pages that a Pew poll in June 2010 found that only 41 percent of Americans correctly identified Jobs as head of Apple. A CBS poll that year concluded that 69 percent of Americans didn't know enough about Jobs to have an opinion about him. In the wake of his death, stories about Jobs' private life once again became fodder for his fans, who wondered, in part, where Jobs' $6.7 billion fortune would land. Steve Jobs Secretive Private Life Jobs most public display of a personal life included his wife, Laurene Powell, and their three children: Reed Paul, Erin Sienna, and Eve. Powell and Jobs had been married for more than 20 years. The two were married in a small Buddhist ceremony in Yosemite National Park in 1991, and lived in Woodside, Calif. But prior to married life, Jobs had played the field. In college, Jobs dated singer Joan Baez, according to Elizabeth Holmes, a friend and classmate. In "The Second Coming of Steve Jobs," Holmes tells biographer Alan Deutschman that Jobs broke up with his serious girlfriend to "begin an affair with the charismatic singer-activist." Holmes confirmed these details to ABC News. Deutschman's book also says Jobs went on a blind date with Diane Keaton; went out with Lisa Birnbach, author of "The Preppy Handbook;" and hand delivered computers to celebrities he admired. He also had a less well-known family life. He has a daughter, Lisa Brennan Jobs, born in 1978 with his high school girlfriend, Chris Ann Brennan. Fortune magazine reported that Jobs denied paternity of Lisa for years, at one point swearing in a court document that he was infertile and could not have children. According to the report, Chris Ann Brennan collected welfare for a time to support the child, until Jobs later acknowledged Lisa as his daughter. Jobs' reluctance to accept Lisa is ironic since he was given up for adoption as a child and has refused to speak to his biological father, despite the father's efforts to contact Jobs. Abdulfattah "John" Jandali, a Syrian man who fathered Jobs, had emailed his son a few times in a tentative effort to make contact. The father never called the son because he feared Jobs would think the dad who had given him up was now after his fortune. And Jobs never responded to his father's emails. "I really don't have anything to say," Jandali, vice president at Boomtown Hotel Casino in Reno, Nev., told the International Business Times when asked about his son's death. Jandali, a Syrian immigrant, had been quoted by the New York Post recently saying he didn't know until just a few years ago that the baby he and his ex-wife, Joanne Simpson, gave up grew to be Apple's CEO. Jandali told the Post that had it been his choice, he would have kept the baby. But Simpson's father did not approve of her marrying a Syrian, so she moved to San Francisco to have the baby alone and give him up for adoption. Jandali, who is 80, said at the time that he would have been happy to just have a cup of coffee with the son he never knew before it was too late. Stories of Jobs' battle with a form of pancreatic cancer and his liver transplant were public and Jobs' health had deteriorated to the point where he was forced to resign as CEO of Apple. READ MORE: Steve Jobs' 20 Best Quotes He was quoted as saying, "This might sound strange, though, but I am not prepared, even if either of us was on our deathbeds, to pick up the phone to call him." Jobs also had a biological sister with whom he became close in later years. Mona Simpson, the acclaimed writer of books like "Anywhere But Here," offered Jobs information on his birth parents and wrote a book based on their relationship entitled "A Regular Guy." Though Simpson had a relationship with their 80-year-old biological father, Jobs rebuffed him to the end. 0 Shares Email Star Comments Steve Jobs' Secret Personal Life +Steve Jobs, Apple Founder, Dead at 56 +Steve Jobs Resigns as Apple CEO.

A friend sent the group a link to the Indivisible Guide, which television talk show host Rachel Maddow explained for her viewers on her MSNBC show Jan. 6. By then, Lisenbery, of Huntington Beach, decided to check out the Indivisible site. It offered two options at the time: talk to your congressperson or start a group with 5-10 like-minded citizens. Lisenbery started a Facebook page for the 48th Congressional District, whose voters from Seal Beach to Laguna Beach re-elected Dana Rohrabacher last November. “It had 200 members in the first week,” he said. His conversion to activist took a push from Sharon Toji, of the Indivisible OC 45. That group is pressing Rep. Mimi Walters, of the 45th Congressional District in south county, to hold town hall meetings. Toji encouraged Lisenbery to start Indivisible OC 48. Since the November election, political neophytes such as Lisenbery, who once regarded voting the extent of their public duty, have slowly evolved to step into leadership roles within fledgling protest groups in order for their voices to be heard by their elected officials. Like Lisenbery, the Indivisible team are all volunteers “Our only goal is to help the real leaders on the ground who are resisting Trump’s agenda on their home turf,” the website says. The Indivisible; A Practical Guide for Resisting the Trump Agenda came on line, by the authors’ own description, as a poorly formatted, typo-filled, Google doc in December 2016. To date it has been downloaded over 1 million times by 4,500 groups in nearly every congressional district in the country, the board of indivisibleguide.com claims. The Guide is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial- ShareAlike 4.0 International License. Former congressional staffers who witnessed the rise of the Tea Party are the authors of the Indivisible Guide, which is a 25 page, step-by-step playbook for individuals, groups, and organizations looking to replicate the Tea Party’s success in getting Congress to listen to a small, vocal, dedicated group of constituents, their website says.

Sue Dvorak, of Newport Beach, attended the women’s march in Santa Ana after Inauguration Day. It was her first political event, but now she’s one of the principal organizers in OC 48. “This is a 100 percent grassroots movement; we are all volunteers,” she said. Now with 1,500 Facebook page members, the group is working to refine its focus on health care and the environment. She said attendance at meetings of Newport Beach’s Democratic Club has doubled. A similar phenomenon is taking place in Laguna Beach and San Juan Capistrano, according to Fran Sdao, chair of the county Democratic Party. At a well-attended meeting of the Laguna Beach Democratic Club preceding the women’s march, some members brought their adult daughters, recalled Audrey Prosser, a club member. “We all shared our feelings about the election and the younger women were energized to get involved,” she said. Speech therapist Lynn Epstein, who joined other Laguna Beach residents at the women’s march in Washington, D.C., also recently joined the local Democratic Club. There, she learned of another grassroots movement, WAVE4all . Women of America for Values and Ethics is comprised of 80 people and was started by a San Juan Capistrano attorney after learning that some of her friends voted for Trump, Prosser said. Epstein plans to check out that group as well. The WAVE group and the Laguna Beach Democratic Club along with the Rancho Santa Fe Democratic Club have planned an “activist training day,” Take Back the House in 2018, for Sunday, March 5, at the Newport Dunes Bayside Pavilion. Organizers hope to at least half fill the 900-person venue at $15 per person to hear Sara El-Amine, the director of Organizing for Action, a 20 million-person strong grassroots movement which advocated for former President Barack Obama. Another local activist group plans the Courage Campaign, which will send “search parties” and hold vigils outside the homes of California Congress members who have not scheduled town hall meetings during this week’s congressional recess. Ed Royce of Fullerton and Rohrabacher’s homes are on the list. Laguna local Carrie Reynolds’ first activist move was mobilizing friends to attend the Jan. 21 march in the nation’s capital. Now she plans to attend the training day in Newport. The Laguna Beach Democratic Club draws a standing room only crowd at a strategy meeting earlier this month. Patti Jo Kiraly, a 32-year Sawdust Festival exhibitor and past president of the Laguna Beach High School PTA, says she’s never before been involved in politics beyond voting. “I am not an activist, really,” she said. Nevertheless, she’s marched in Washington, attended a Democratic Club meeting which she described as “packed,” and participated in one visit to Rohrabacher’s office to request he hold a town hall meeting. “I was curious to find out what our representatives are doing,” said Kiraly, adding that while she did not vote for him, she’s had no particular complaint against him. Kiraly hopes the March 5 training will emphasize peaceful and respectful activism. Prosser says the training goal is to be “effective and strategic.” With the skill sets of newer and younger Democratic Club members, “we now have the tools to make change,” she said.     About the Author Previous Story DUI Arrests Drop as Ride Sharing and Enforcement Picks Up Next Story Decorated War Pilot Returns to the Spotlight 6 Comments Jason February 26, 2017 at 7:31 pm Great article thank you. Its nice to hear that our efforts are voluntary. Your description of the voter only turned activist is my story too.

I am in HB Onice March 1, 2017 at 7:07 am Thank you for sharing the reality behind the bogus “paid protesters” claim. I have never been politically active before, but now I find myself knowing who my congressman and senators are, attending rallies and indivisible meetings. I think a lot of us have simply been propelled into action. Andrea Adelson March 2, 2017 at 8:18 am Hi Judy: please sign up for the Firebrand newsletters at the homepage and like us on Facebook.
