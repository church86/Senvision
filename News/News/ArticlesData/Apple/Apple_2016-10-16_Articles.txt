(GPRO) Stock Slammed by Karma Drone Recall Recent Posts: Why Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Ended the Free Supercharger Ride Apple Inc.’s (AAPL) New MacBook Pro Is Actually a Monster Hit GoPro Inc. (GPRO) Stock Slammed by Karma Drone Recall View All Posts In a blog post, Microsoft Corporation’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) Windows and Devices team announced the company will be holding a special event on Oct. 26. It has been a while since MSFT made any major product announcements, so what can we expect to see two weeks from now? Source: Microsoft There are plenty of theories, but here are a few of the most likely. New Surface PC to Take on the iMac Photos have leaked online of a new Surface-branded keyboard and mouse. The company has been always offered a range of wireless accessories. And recently, in wake of vulnerabilities discovered in millions of older wireless keyboards, MSFT has been heavily promoting its line of AES encrypted keyboards. However … Given the credibility it has gained as a premium hardware designer after the release of the Surface Pro tablet, then the Surface Book laptop, a new Surface All-in-One PC seems highly likely. That keyboard and mouse may sell separately, but would likely be pack-ins included with the new desktop computer. The 10 Best Dividend Stocks for Every Retirement Portfolio PC sales have been in the dumps, but MSFT has proven it has the design chops to steal premium device dollars from its OEMs in the Windows tablet and laptop spaces. It’s only natural it would want to take on the desktop PC as well. But by going the route of releasing a minimalist, All-in-One Surface PC, Microsoft gets a device that looks infinitely sexier than just a box. Just as importantly, it would have an option to take on rival Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and its popular iMac line. A Surface PC using the All-in-One approach — which actually shows up in a patent filing uncovered by Windows Central — would have appeal to professionals, especially when paired with a Surface pen for interaction. Apple’s iMac lacks this capability altogether. Windows 10 The Verge and other outlets are looking for the Microsoft Event to include a Windows 10 component. Specifically, MSFT is expected to outline its plans for two major feature releases in 2017, code-named “Redstone 2” and “Redstone 3.” The general theme of the Windows 10 presentation is expected to be the operating system’s tight integration with Widows devices. MSFT will be pushing this as a productivity and convenience advantage. There could also be some Xbox gaming news, focused on Windows 10 integration. Surface Pro 5, Surface Phone, Band 3? Nope, Nope and cancelled (supposedly). It looks as though MSFT isn’t going to show off a refreshed Surface Pro — or Surface Book, for that matter. Instead, rumors have Microsoft playing nice with its OEM manufacturing partners (perhaps repairing some damage done by the news of the new Surface PC), instead featuring their laptops onstage. MSFT may still be planning to take on Apple and Alphabet Inc’s (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google with a flagship Surface smartphone, but don’t expect to see it at this Microsoft event. The Microsoft Band 3 fitness tracker apparently exists — at least spy shots have leaked of it — but the device has been cancelled, at least for now. Microsoft has gone on record saying existing Band 2 inventory has been sold through with no plans to replace it this year. Additionally, the company has removed the Band SDK for developers and is purging references from its webstore.

For all the details without having to listen to two hours of how cool Windows 10 is or how the new Surface PC is going to kick the iMac off trendy desktops everywhere, check back here for our post-event wrap-up. As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

M Monday, Nov 14 2016 | Updated at 01:40 AM EST Stay Connected With Us F T R Opinion Academics Students Special Reports Sports Finance Tech Career College Video Oct 17, 2016 12:56 AM EDT By Beth Golden, UniversityHerald Reporter Apple Launches New macOS SIerra: Cool Features and Upgrading Tips Just In Time For School AN FRANCISCO, CA - JUNE 13: Craig Federighi, Apple's senior vice president of Software Engineering, introduces the new macOS Sierra software at an Apple event at the Worldwide Developer's Conference in San Francisco, California. Thousands of people have shown up to hear about Apple's latest updates. (Photo : Andrew Burton/Getty Images) Last month, the tech giant deployed the recent upgrade for their Mac product line: macOS Sierra. In their annual upgrades, Apple claims that Sierra is built with the users in mind. The upgrade is now available on the App Store and it comes with both big and subtle changes, so if you haven't made the switch yet, here are somethings you might want to know. Advertisement First off, it was announced earlier this week that Apple will begin downloading macOS Sierra today, it won't automatically install itself but if you'd rather install the update at your own leisure, we suggest checking your apps and update preferences. The Mac Observer also reported earlier this week that one reason you may want to upgrade to the new operating system sooner is security. It notes some issues about El Capitan and Yosemite and also mentioned these and earlier versions of OS X might share the same security issues with the iOS. The article in The Mac Observer suggests that if you don't have any mission critical apps that might affect your work and other projects, then you should go ahead and upgrade. If you are concerned whether or not critical mission apps installed to your Mac will be affected by the upgrade then it's highly recommended to get in touch with vendors and developers to get some advice on the issue. Before you go ahead and download, check your disk space and more importantly, check your Mac's compatibility with the new OS. Apple decided to continue with their recent streak of naming their OS after California landmarks: Yosemite, after the Yosemite Valley, El Capitan, one of the iconic rock formations in the valley and now, Sierra after the Sierra Nevada mountain range. The biggest change is Siri. Yes, Apple's digital assistant makes its debut on Mac. It has the same capabilities it did with the iOS and a few more like displaying your computer's content or checking its status. The next coolest innovation is the ability to copy and paste universally. This means that you can copy a picture from your Apple mobile device and paste it to a presentation or document you're working on in your MacBook or iMac. If you own an iWatch, another great feature is that you can now use your iWatch to unlock your apple computer with Sierra. Advertisement Mac users will now also have the ability to customize the menu bar and rearrange icons to their liking. With Sierra, it's also possible to share notes in iCloud. What's more is that you now also have the ability to sync your entire desktop with iCloud. Tags mac, apple, macos sierra, Siri, iWatch, iOS © 2016 University Herald, All rights reserved.

The latter is, of course, highly anticipated as it brings the much talked about Portrait mode for the iPhone 7 Plus dual-lens camera.  According to MacRumors, this new beta is likely to contain bug fixes for issues found in previous versions and the ones identified since iOS 10 was released to the public. It is also expected to bring under-the-hood improvements that would be noticeable to developers and beta testers.  Related Stories Apple CEO Tim Cook Teases ‘Deep Engineering’ Plans For Japan Facility Disgruntled Samsung Customers Are Not Buying Phones From Apple Rival Again Patent Reveals New Apple Watch Wristband Technology The new iOS 10.1 beta 4 is available to download from the Apple Developer Center. Registered developers can get it from there. On the other hand, beta testers can download this new software from the Apple Beta Software Program. Both developers and beta testers can also rely on the over-the-air software update as long as proper configuration profile has been installed on their test devices.  Aside from the new beta, Apple has also released a software update that’s exclusive to iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus devices. This update, iOS 10.0.3, is said to be the tech giant’s answer to complaints that the handsets regularly suffer cellular connectivity problems, as per AppleInsider.  Per previous reports, Verizon and AT&T subscribers were complaining about difficulties in establishing stable LTE connections with their iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus handsets. Apple then promised to fix the problem through an update.  Owners of Apple’s newest iPhone models can download iOS 10.0.3 with build code 14A551 from iTunes when their devices are connected to a Mac or PC. They may also simply resort to clicking Software Update in the Settings menu. Once downloaded, the software will automatically be installed to the device.  Join the Discussion Most Read Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.

An AppleCare+ support page for the United Arab Emirates, shared by 9to5Mac, mentions AppleCare+ options for the "Apple Watch" and "Apple Watch Victory," a product that does not exist. On a similar page for Canada, the "Apple Watch" and the "Apple Watch Nike+" are listed in the same text, suggesting Apple perhaps planned to call the Apple Watch Nike+ the Apple Watch Victory at some point before changing the name to something more brand oriented. United Arab Emirates AppleCare+ support page on top, Canadian AppleCare+ support page on bottom It's possible "Apple Watch Victory" is an unreleased product, a scrapped product or an alternate name for a different version of the Apple Watch, but given the evidence of the two similar AppleCare+ pages, it seems most likely "Apple Watch Victory" was a code name or an alternate name considered for the Apple Watch Apple designed in collaboration with Nike. Apple's AppleCare+ support page for the Apple Watch in the United States is worded differently, referring only to the Apple Watch without a mention of specific models in the section in question. While inconsequential, it's always interesting to get an inside look at the changes that a product goes through before release and a glimpse at one of the names that Apple used as a code name or considered using for the Apple Watch Nike line. The Apple Watch Nike+, which is an Apple Watch Sport model with Nike branding, Nike software, and a unique perforated Sport Band, officially launches on Friday, October 28. 38mm models are priced at $369 and 42mm models are priced at $399. Update: The "Apple Watch Victory" mention has been removed from Apple's website.

Behind Apple’s Scaled-back Car Plans -- Mark Gurman and Alex Webb at Bloomberg Technology report on how Apple has scaled back its automotive ambitions from becoming an outright competitor to Tesla Motors to developing an underlying self-driving car platform for now. The Project Titan team has suffered from hundreds of layoffs, reassignments, and engineers leaving on their own, and the refocused team reportedly has a year to determine the feasibility of the platform and decide on whether to design its own vehicle or partner with existing carmakers. It’s possible that Apple waded into the murky automotive waters with an overinflated view of its ability to reinvent a complex and entrenched industry, but we can hope that Apple’s continued presence will at least spur carmakers to improve the software aspects of their automobiles. Read/post comments iPhone 7 Offers a Virtual Home Button When the Real One Fails -- Ever wondered what happens if the solid-state Home button on the iPhone 7 fails? 9to5Mac reports that iOS 10 puts a virtual Home button on the screen so you can keep using your iPhone (presumably in conjunction with your passcode, if the Home button’s Touch ID sensor is also broken). This virtual Home button is similar to the on-screen Home button provided by Assistive Touch (in Settings > General > Accessibility > AssistiveTouch), except it’s affixed to the bottom-center of the screen. With rumors swirling that Apple may be planning to ditch the physical Home button entirely, this could be a first glimpse at the future of the iPhone. Read/post comments Tim Cook Bullish on Augmented Reality -- Two of the hottest technologies at the moment are virtual reality (VR), which isolates users in an entirely virtual world, and augmented reality (AR), which overlays virtual elements on top of the real world. In an interview with BuzzFeed News, Apple CEO Tim Cook expressed a clear preference for AR, saying, “VR has some interesting applications, but I don’t think it’s a broad-based technology like AR. Augmented reality will take some time to get right, but I do think that it’s profound.” Why? Cook said, “There’s no substitute for human contact, and so you want the technology to encourage that.” Read/post comments Amazon Prime Reading Provides Kindle Books for Free -- Voracious readers take note: Amazon has added another perk to its $99-per-year Amazon Prime program. Prime members can now download over 1000 books, comics, and Kindle Singles to their Kindles or Kindle apps for free. This benefit comes on top of Amazon Prime’s free 2-day shipping, free video streaming for thousands of movies and TV shows, free streaming of over one million songs, and more. The book selection is unsurprisingly random, with a few best-sellers like “Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone” and “The Hobbit” mixed in with titles and authors looking for an audience. On its own, Prime Reading isn’t a good reason to subscribe to Amazon Prime, but if you’re already a subscriber, it might be a good way to get something to read when you’re out of books. (The link goes to the list of Prime Reading books, something that’s otherwise hard to find.) Read/post comments   Make friends and influence people by sponsoring TidBITS!

Apple will see 5 million to 7 million iPhone 7 orders from ex-Galaxy Note 7 users, wrote Ming-Chi Kuo, a notoriously accurate analyst at KGI Securities, according to 9to5Mac. Those orders are likely to focus on the higher-end iPhone 7 Plus, thanks to its dual camera, 9to5Mac's Benjamin Mayo reports, citing Kuo. Samsung recently expanded its existing recall of 1 million phones in the U.S. amid continuing reports that the batteries overheat, catch fire and explode in a handful of cases. Kuo's report reiterates other Wall Street predictions that Apple will win millions of mobile customers from the recall of the now-discontinued phone. For instance, Brian White, a Drexel Hamilton analyst, estimated in a research note that Apple could pick up at least 8 million extra unit sales this calendar year, out of the 10 million to 14 million Galaxy Note 7 phones he expected to be sold in the second half of the year. Chinese manufacturer Huawei also stands to gain, the report said. That company was already third behind Apple and Samsung in worldwide smartphone shipment volume in the second quarter, according to IDC estimates.

That grew into a whole ecosystem that can be kind of confusing until you understand what’s going on with the different apps Apple gave us. Read on to get the lowdown on HealthKit, Health, and Activity. Sorting out HealthKit, Health, and Activity What is HealthKit? Apple introduced HealthKit with iOS 8 as a unified platform for managing all of our health and fitness data. HealthKit is essentially a standardized database tracker apps and devices can feed information into—like how far you walk in a day, how much you weigh, and how well you sleep. It’s also a secure platform for sharing that information privately and securely with healthcare providers. Apps that write information to your HealthKit database ask for permission first, and you can revoke that permission later if you change your mind. What is Health? Health is Apple’s own app for viewing your HealthKit database. It also lets you set which apps can read from and write to your HealthKit database, and lets you set up your emergency contact information. Health doesn’t handle fitness tracking, but instead gives you a way to view the data other apps and devices added to your HealthKit database. What is Activity? Activity is Apple’s fitness tracking app for the Apple Watch and iPhone. It shows the data the motion sensors in both devices collect and write to the HealthKit database, and lets you set daily fitness goals. The nice thing about Activity is that it gives you a similar interface on your iPhone and iPad for seeing your activity and fitness goals. The bad thing is that it’s confusing for some people because it shows the same data as the Health app, but with a different look. Activity also lets you start and track different types of workouts such as weight lifting, running, and swimming. A good rule of thumb is to use the Health app for a quick overview of your health and fitness activity, and use the Activity app to see how you’re doing throughout the day. What about other fitness apps? Since other health and fitness tracking devices can write to your HealthKit database, it stands to reason other apps can access that data too—and it turns out there are loads of devices and apps capable of doing just that. The Nike+ Run Club app and Runkeeper, for example, can add your runs to HealthKit and display information from the database, too. The Health Mate app from Withings logs data from devices such as the Body smart scale and Activité fitness tracker watch. If Apple’s own Health and Activity apps don’t show your fitness data the way you like, other developers are at the ready with alternatives. HealthView and FitPort, for example, give you strikingly different views into your HealthKit data and fitness goals. If you decide later a third party app or device shouldn’t get access to your HealthKit database, head over to the Health app and tap Sources. Uninstalling an app will revoke its HealthKit access, too.

So… Activity is a separate app but it is only visible through Health? That’s odd, but OK. Nutrition is the same I assume, but I can’t figure out how to enter anything directly into it. I downloaded a recommended App, (Calorie Counter and Diet Tracker by MyFitnessPal) but it would not talk to Health. None of the data showed up in Nutrition, though it did record my steps. Then the price turned out to be absurd, ($13.99CDN/Month) so I deleted the app. Not sure what I’m supposed to do with Sleep or “Mindfulness”, whatever that is. So I have a long way to go to figure this out. October 17, 2016 at 7:20 EST PM Add a Comment Click here to cancel reply.

Citing unnamed sources, the report said that Apple has reassigned employees and is focusing solely on developing an autonomous software system. Furthermore, the company’s executive team has imposed a deadline of the end of 2017 to determine the viability of that system. But, Apple Car isn’t necessarily dead. Bob Mansfield I’ve made this point many times when writing about Apple Car, but it bears repeating: Bob Mansfield is a bad-ass. His task, as we understand it, was to figure out what to do with Project Titan—Apple’s codename for its car. He’s known for pulling the plug on projects that need to die. The fact that he hasn’t says just as much as the changes he has wrought. You’ll see headlines saying that Apple Car is dead, but pay little heed to them. I’m not saying it’s not dead, I’m saying that its moot. The team has until the end of next year to figure out if its autonomous software works. If it does, that’s when Apple will decide what to do with it. According to Bloomberg, options include partnering with automakers and revisiting the idea of Apple making its own car. Consider it Schrödinger’s Car. Right now, Apple Car is both alive and dead, and only when viewed at some specific point in the future will we know which. Team An interesting tidbit from Bloomberg’s report is that the Project Titan team has remained consistent at around 1,000 people. Considering that aspects of the project have been terminated, some employees have been reassigned, and still more left Apple entirely, it means Apple has continued to hire even while scaling back. That means Apple remains commited to playing a larger role in the auto industry. Apple may still ditch that role, and it may or may not end up making its own car, but Project Titan continues as of now. Best Guess for Apple Car All that said, I would now be surprised if Apple ended up making its own automobile. I was confident Apple was working on its own car when this story first broke in February of 2015. And it turned out Apple was doing just that. But things change. While Apple could come back to the idea of making its own car, it now seems a lot more likely the company will eventually partner with one or more automakers. And the thing is, that will still be cool. An Apple-designed autonomous vehicle software system could still improve the driving experience, and having a better driving experience was always what excited me about Apple Car. Jeff Gamet, John Martellaro, and I discussed this topic on Monday’s Daily Observations. Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn Reddit Add a Comment Click here to cancel reply.

_ Macworld Australia MAC iPad iPhone iSnap App Guide Gadget Guide mResell HOME NEWS FEATURES REVIEWS HELP/TIPS BLOGS Mac In Business Communications Productivity Security Workflow FORUM MAGAZINE Digital Subscription Current Issue Back Issues Report: Apple slams the brakes on electric Apple Car to focus on auto software Ian Paul 18 October, 2016 View more articles fromthe author AAA Comments News Apple’s car project is reportedly being scaled back. The effort, codenamed Project Titan, will now focus on creating an autonomous driving software platform as opposed to a full-blown car, according to Bloomberg. The latest report from Bloomberg basically confirms the news organisation’s own suspicions back in July. At that time, Apple hired Dan Dodge, creator of BlackBerry-owned QNX automotive software platform, which Bloomberg believed signalled a stronger focus on software. However, Bloomberg said at the time that Apple was not abandoning car development, which no longer appears to be the case. Project Titan has been scaled back with ‘hundreds’ of job cuts, and a declaration by project leader Bob Mansfield that Apple was shifting to focus on the platform, Bloomberg reports. The original plan – or so the rumours say – was for Apple to roll out its own car around 2021. In recent months, the general consensus was that this car would be of the self-driving kind. Autonomous vehicles are seen as the future of the car industry and many companies want a piece of that future. Google has been working on autonomous cars for years, more and more traditional car companies are working on autonomous vehicles, and even Uber has plans for an autonomous car by the 2020s. As it stands right now, however, Apple’s self-driving plans will be more about partnering with other companies, or rolling out its own car at a much later date. That’s if Project Titan even gets out of the development phase. Bloomberg says Apple executives have put Titan on a deadline. If the group can’t prove the “feasibility of the self-driving system” and “decide on a final direction” by late 2017, Project Titan may never surface. Why this matters: Just like any other technology company, Apple develops and prototypes devices and software all the time. Much of that effort never ends up as a fully realised product – the oft-rumoured Apple television set is a good example of that. The Apple Car is a little different since there’s so much research and development into self-driving cars.  Apple may feel a little more pressure than usual to keep pace with so many rivals hard at work on autonomous cars.

_ Macworld Australia MAC iPad iPhone iSnap App Guide Gadget Guide mResell HOME NEWS FEATURES REVIEWS HELP/TIPS BLOGS Mac In Business Communications Productivity Security Workflow FORUM MAGAZINE Digital Subscription Current Issue Back Issues How to undelete and re-delete mail in iOS Glenn Fleishman 18 October, 2016 View more articles fromthe author AAA Comments Help An iOS hidden feature surprised P M Wright. She had deleted an email in iOS and a pop-up appeared that asked if she wanted to ‘Undo Trash’. She’d never seen it before, and wondered what precise action it would accomplish – undo the deletion of all her deleted email? And where does deleted email wind up and for how long? A series of excellent questions that all involve implicit behaviour that average users aren’t required to learn about and Apple doesn’t fully expose, because it’s not typically necessary to understand. The Undo Trash message is a ‘hidden’ feature: after taking an action in many Apple and third-party apps, you can shake your iPhone gently, which the built-in accelerometer detects. Software that supports undo can then display a message. It’s nifty, but if you don’t know about it, a surprise! Tapping Undo in any app typically is a single operation. Only the immediately previous action gets reverted. In this case, the message you just trashed gets restored to the mailbox from whence it was plucked. But this brings up the deeper question P M asks: where does deleted email go and when is it removed from one’s email account? With most modern email accounts, when you delete a message it’s moved from a mailbox, like your Inbox, to another mailbox labeled Deleted Messages, Deleted Items or something similar. But it remains on the system that you interact with to retrieve mail, whether that’s Apple’s iCloud, Google’s Gmail or another. iOS doesn’t store mail locally on a permanent basis the way that macOS does. iOS Mail always considers itself to be looking at a retrieved, temporarily cached copy of your central email storage. macOS can retrieve mail and store it in local folders and then either retain it on the server or delete it. You can also keep all email on the server and move specific messages (like archives) from the server to local folders in Mail to reduce online storage requirements. As a result of this conceptual difference, iOS always moves deleted mail into a Deleted Messages folder when you trash it, while macOS lets you choose to leave mail on the server in a mailbox (which can vary by name depending on your email service), or delete it from the server and move it to a Junk mailbox on your Mac. If you choose Junk, you can’t retrieve a deleted message from iOS or another Mac; you have to retrieve it from the Mac on which you deleted the message. (You can also opt to not have a trash mailbox at all, in which case messages are instantly and permanently deleted from macOS.) Both iOS and macOS’s Mail apps automatically delete email from active email accounts they routinely check for new messages after a preset period of time. The default for iOS is one week; the default for macOS is one month. To change the iOS setting, you have to dive deeply. Open Settings, and then tap Mail. Tap the Accounts link at the top, tap the account for which you want to change the setting, swipe down to the Advanced section at the bottom and tap Mail, swipe down to the bottom and tap Advanced, and then you can finally tap the Remove item below Deleted Messages. This lets you change the automatic deletion period. In macOS, select Mail > Preferences, select a mail account at left, and then click Mailbox Behaviors. From the Trash Mailbox menu, you can select how frequently and to which mailbox to delete messages.   Related Tags:  Share: Comments Related Posts Random Posts Apple removes negative app reviews caused by update crashing bug Evernote can now remind you to update your notes PADACS UltraCharge Mini Blackbox i10 active noise cancelling earphones for iPod Foxconn has ‘significant issues’ around working conditions Leave a Comment Click here to cancel reply.

October 17 AAPL: 117.55 -0.08 References to ‘Apple Watch Victory’ model spotted on Apple’s website Jordan Kahn - 4 weeks ago @JordanKahn Apple View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit When a few 9to5Mac readers noticed references to “Apple Watch Victory” on Apple’s website today, which seemed to hint at a previously unknown Apple Watch model, we were obviously intrigued. Is Apple Watch Victory indeed an upcoming Apple Watch model, or something else? One possibility is that Apple Watch Victory is an early name considered for the recent Apple Watch Series 2 refresh and was simply on some webpages as a placeholder that someone forgot to remove. More specifically, it looks like it might have been an early name considered for the new Apple Watch Nike+ model… After some digging, it seems Apple’s website for some countries lists the “Apple Watch Nike+” model in place of where the “Nike Watch Victory” name appears for others. On its webpage for AppleCare plans in the United Arab Emirates (pictured above), for example, Apple lists the “Apple Watch Victory” under hardware coverage, while on its Canadian page it has the known Apple Watch Nike+ model in that paragraph. The “Victory” name also of course aligns nicely with Nike’s branding, with Nike being the goddess of Victory and Nike itself already using “Victory” branding for many of its own products. The new Apple Watch Series 2 models, which feature a GPS chip for standalone fitness features and enhanced waterproofing, first launched in September alongside the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. The new Nike+ Apple Watch model, however, will go on sale in the US and elsewhere later this month starting October 28. We went hands-on earlier this month with Apple Watch Nike+, showing off the unique watch faces, perforated sport band, and other features that make the special edition model differ from the rest of the Series 2 Apple Watch line: While there is still a possibility that ‘Apple Watch Victory’ is a product Apple has yet to reveal, if our theory is right, it’s likely just a rare look at a product name Apple considered but that ultimately didn’t make the cut. If that’s the case, we’d expect Apple will soon remove the text from its website and likely replace it with the Nike+ branding. Update: Apple removed mention of “Nike Watch Victory” on its website and replaced it with Apple Watch Nike+, seemingly confirming our theory. blog comments powered by Disqus Submit a Tip cancel Submitting a tip constitutes permission to publish and syndicate.

He will continue to teach at Carnegie Mellon, but will also serve as "Director of AI Research" at Apple. In his tweet, Salakhutdinov says he is seeking additional research scientists with machine learning expertise to join his team. An included job posting asks that candidates have experience with Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Optimization, and/or Data Mining. Salakhutdinov specializes in statistical machine learning and has authored many papers on neural networks, deep kernel learning, reinforcement learning, and other related topics. His expertise may be used to improve services like Siri, which has been in the spotlight recently after journalist Walt Mossberg wrote a piece calling the personal assistant "limited," "unreliable," and "dumb." Siri is powered by a neural network and uses machine learning techniques to improve over time, as do other Apple features like Spotlight, QuickType, Photos, autocorrect, Maps, and more. Salakhutdinov's hiring comes as rumors suggest Apple is aiming to improve Siri as part of an effort to build the personal assistant into an Amazon Eco-like smart home product that would be able to do things like control smart home accessories. Apple is also on the verge of finishing an R&D research center in Yokohama, Japan, which will focus on "deep engineering" and developing Apple's artificial intelligence services.Tags: Siri, machine learning, artificial intelligence Discuss this article in our forums » View on web 0 shares Share on FacebookShare on TwitterPost on  RedditShare by Email   Source: Wochit News - 2 weeks ago< > Embed Will Gene Editing Cure Sickle Cell Anemia? 00:52 A research team of scientists from Carnegie Mellon and Yale Universities have tested the next generation of gene-editing technology.

Thanks to the Amazon Echo’s popularity, Alphabet, Google’s parent company, is about to unleash a voice-powered speaker of its own, the Google Home. Next year, Apple could also join the fray and release a similar product, this one powered by Siri. Amazon Echo - White Amazon Echo - White Plays all your music from Amazon Music, Spotify, Pandora, iHeartRadio, TuneIn, and more using just your voice Buy Now At Amazon $179.99 In this article, you’ll learn the differences between the Amazon Echo and Google Home. We’ll also take a look at what features an Apple speaker may include. Hi, Alexa Amazon’s Echo ($179/£150) is one of three speakers that now make up Amazon’s lineup of Alexa-powered home devices. Joining the Echo earlier this year were the Amazon Tap ($130) and Amazon Dot ($50/£50). We’re mentioning these speakers only to illustrate the challenges Google Home faces as it heads for release. It’s not just competing against one device, but rather three, each available at different price points. Despite this, from here on, we’ll limit our discussion to the Amazon Echo, as it relates to Google Home. Hardware The Echo features seven microphone sensors embedded under a LED ring at the top of the device. These sensors use what Amazon calls “beam-forming technology,” allowing it to hear from any direction. Ads by Google As a long-time Echo user, I can confirm that it’s a wonderful listener even when there is background noise. It reacts to everything, as long as the questions and comments begin with “Alexa,” which is the device’s default wake word. You can also call the Echo “Amazon,” by changing a setting in the Alexa app. Amazon Echo - Black Amazon Echo - Black Plays all your music from Amazon Music, Spotify, Pandora, iHeartRadio, TuneIn, and more using just your voice Buy Now At Amazon $179.99 Although voice largely controls the Echo, the device also contains three input controls on the top. The first of these is the LED ring, which you can turn left and right to change the speaker volume. There’s also an action button and mute button. The former provides a way to disable a timer or alarm. The latter turns Alexa’s ability to listen on and off. Inside, the Echo includes a 2-inch tweeter and 2.5-inch woofer. This combination makes for a pleasant sound. The Echo is currently available in black and white. If you want a speaker that blends into the background, I’d suggest the black model. If you’re feeling like a rebel, go with the white. Software Alexa, like Google Assistant, processes data in the cloud. Without an internet connection, the Echo becomes a very dumb device. When it is connected online, Alexa can do a lot. Music With Alexa Voice Service, you can ask Alexa to play music, provide information, news, sports scores, weather, and more. To get started, you need to download and install the free Alexa app. From there, you’ll be asked to connect the Echo to your local Wi-Fi network and verify your Amazon account. Echo provides hands-free voice control for many of the most popular music streaming services, including Amazon Music, Prime Music, Spotify, Pandora, iHeartRadio, and TuneIn. Because Echo also works as a Bluetooth speaker, you can also stream from other services like iTunes from your phone or tablet. It’s very simple to use Echo as a music speaker. Alexa does a great job at finding songs and playlists. You can give Alexa Music-related commands, such as, “Alexa…” “… turn it up.” “… play the Beatles playlist.” “… play Today’s Hits from Pandora.” Having a speaker to listen to music is one of the main reasons for buying an Echo. However, thanks to Alexa, Echo is much more than a reasonably-priced home speaker. Amazon Apps Alexa Skills are apps that work with Amazon hardware to give you a more personalized experience. To date, there are over 3,000 Alexa Skills 7 Creative Uses for Amazon Echo and Alexa 7 Creative Uses for Amazon Echo and Alexa You’ve seen the ads starring Alec Baldwin, but you're still not sure what Amazon Echo does or whether you need one in your home. We’re about to find out. Read More and counting, courtesy of the Alexa Skills Kit (ASK), which allows third-parties to create these skill sets. Alexa doesn’t have these skills automatically. Instead, you must install them from the Alexa app. For example, you can ask Alexa to order a Domino’s pizza or request an Uber. When you’re bored, challenge Alexa to a game of Jeopardy! When you’re looking for a fancy meal to prepare, ask Alexa to read back the Food Network recipe on the TV right now. One important aspect of Alexa Skills is the Smart Home Skill API. With this tool, manufacturers can have Alexa communicate with their smart appliances. As a result, you can talk to control lights, door locks, thermostats, fans, and more. The biggest players in the smart home industry have products that interact with Alexa, including Philips Hue, Ecobee, and Samsung SmartThings. Amazon is so serious about the Alexa Skills program that it’s begun courting would-be hardware partners with its $100 million Alexa Fund. With this fund, venture capital funding is being provided to fuel voice technology innovation. In other words, you should expect the number of Alexa Skills to continue to rise in the coming years. Being Prime Amazon provides a few extras for Echo users who are also Prime subscribers. You can enjoy hands-free shopping with Alexa on millions of items on Amazon as an exclusive benefit of your Prime membership. You can also listen to unlimited Prime Music, which also includes original audio series and playlists handcrafted for every interest. “OK, Google” Google Home ($129) was first teased in May at Google I/O The Best of Google I/O 2016, Nokia Makes a Comeback... [Tech News Digest] The Best of Google I/O 2016, Nokia Makes a Comeback... [Tech News Digest] Google reveals new products and services at I/O 2016, Nokia comes alive once more, a reminder that Facebook Live broadcasts are public, and the first teaser for the new Star Trek TV series. Read More . Five months later, it was officially demoed, with a public launch date of November 4. Here’s what we know about Google Home before its release. Hardware Google Home probably isn’t going to win any design awards thanks to its funny exterior that looks like a two-toned air freshener. At the top, you’ll find two far-field microphones alongside four LED lights. This location also serves as a touch surface, where you can play or pause music, change the volume, or mute the system. The base of the device is covered in gray fabric, although you can change this using one of the extra bases Google plans on offering. These come in both fabric and metal varieties. Inside, Google Home features an integrated “high-excursion” speaker that’s supposed to deliver “crystal-clear highs and rich bass.” Better still, Alphabet promises that multiple Google Home devices can be grouped together to enjoy the same song in every room. This feature is a big deal. Alexa speakers don’t communicate very well with one another. Plus, you can’t use two or more Amazon Echos to play stereo sound. Software Google Home’s killer feature could turn out to be Google Assistant. Like Alexa, Google Assistant uses a cloud to answer your questions. Unlike Alexa, Google Assistant uses natural language processing, which is supposed to improve reliability. As a bonus, the appliance can also access your Google account for information about your daily schedule, assuming that you use Google Calendar. Music At launch, Google Home is compatible with Google Music, YouTube, Spotify, Pandora, and TuneIn. For those who have never had a YouTube Red Is YouTube Red Worth the Money? 7 Things You Need to Consider Is YouTube Red Worth the Money? 7 Things You Need to Consider YouTube Red has made headlines, both good and bad, but is the $10-a-month subscription service actually worth the money? Here, we look at the facts, and draw some conclusions. Read More subscription, Google offers a free six-month subscription with every Google Home purchase. You’ll need this subscription to listen to YouTube Music on the device. During the Google Home launch event, Google showed how natural language performs when trying to find a song. In the example, a user said, “OK, Google, play that Shakira song from Zootopia.” Google Assistant was able to figure out the song was “Try Everything” and began playing it through the YouTube integration. This example suggests that Google Home’s approach is more advanced than Alexa. Smart Home Google Home also has a smart home component similar to what you’ll find on the Echo. At launch, Google Home works with Philips Hue, Samsung SmartThings, and IFTTT. There’s also compatibility with other Alphabet products, including Google Chromecast 7 Things You Didn't Know You Could Do With a Chromecast 7 Things You Didn't Know You Could Do With a Chromecast You have finally taken the plunge and bought yourself a shiny new Chromecast, but what happens next?

For example, you can throw a song from your smartphone to a better speaker in your home, simply by tapping the Cast logo within a supported app. This process works on any Chromecast-connected device, including televisions. Welcoming Developers A specialized Google developer kit helps would-be companies to integrate their products with both Google Assistant and Google Home. The Actions Kit comes in two flavors: direct and conversational. Direct Actions are for straightforward tasks, such as turning on a light in the bedroom or playing a song from YouTube. More complicated Conversational Actions require some back and forth between you and Google Assistant. For example, you might want to set your Nest Thermostat to a certain temperature for X number of minutes. Again, this type of interaction sounds more advanced 20 Echo Skills That Show Alexa's Not Always So Smart 20 Echo Skills That Show Alexa's Not Always So Smart Despite all the things that you can do with Alexa out of the box, its extensibility via Skills is far more intriguing. Here are 20 Echo Skills that may surprise you! Read More than what Alexa has to offer. However, until Google Home arrives in the wild (and more developers sign up for the service) comparing both products is somewhat difficult. Up Next: Siri? Apple is notorious for keeping secrets, so we don’t know what form a Siri-powered device for the home would take. And yet, we probably have a good idea what the device will be able to do whenever it does arrive. HomeKit On iOS, Siri works with HomeKit Getting the Most Out of Apple HomeKit and the iOS 10 Home App Getting the Most Out of Apple HomeKit and the iOS 10 Home App In this article, you’ll learn about the growing list of HomeKit-related products and how to control them.

It also lets manufacturers of existing equipment make gateways that connect to HomeKit.

In other words, the Siri speaker will almost certainly be able to control home appliances. No doubt, the Siri speaker will also heavily integrate with iTunes and Apple Music. Yes, just like the other two products. Differences According to Bloomberg, Apple hopes to use more advanced microphone and speaker technology. Some of the current prototypes also include facial recognition sensors, “which may help the device act based on who is in a room or a person’s emotional state.” Other features may include being able to process Siri commands currently available on the iPhone, integrated mapping information, and more. Apple’s voice-activated device could arrive as early as next spring. Which One Should You Buy? There are many differences between the Amazon Echo and Google Home. The Amazon Echo offers more features overall. However, I would expect Google Home to play catch up very quickly thanks to Google Assistant. Committed Apple users will have wait to see what the iPhone maker plans on bringing to the market. For everyone else, weigh the pros and cons between the Echo and Google Home and make an informed choice. If possible, buy one of each and see which one you like best. Echo is available exclusively through Amazon. You can pre-order a Google Home through the Google website.

With the holidays approaching some people might want to buy a Google Home or Amazon Echo. It's important for them to know, however, that Apple could also be introducing a similar product as early as next spring. Reply Bruce Romond October 18, 2016 at 11:46 am The article does not mention that Echo can access Google calendar. Also fyi there is a third que word...."echo" to wake up Echo.

While most retailers are increasing security in order to deter thieves, Apple is actually decreasing security in order to improve the overall shopping experience. Which is a bold move. If you walk into your local Apple Store, you’ll notice everything is essentially nailed down. All of those expensive Macs and iPhones are tethered to the tables to prevent customers from simply walking out with them. So far, so good. And pretty much standard across the retail world. However, Apple is now actively removing those security tethers from the iPhones on display in its stores. It’s starting with the recently refurbished Regent Street store in London, along with a couple of other stores in the UK and Canada. If you walk into one of these stores, you’ll be able to pick up the new iPhone 7 Everything You Need to Know About the iPhone 7 & iPhone 7 Plus Everything You Need to Know About the iPhone 7 & iPhone 7 Plus No headphone port, water and dust resistance, and Apple's best camera yet -- this is the iPhone 7.

But you could, if you were a despicable human being, also walk out of the store with that display model. You shouldn’t, but you could. Bricking Your Illicit Booty There’s a definite risk of this happening, and Apple knows it’s likely to occur on a semi-regular basis. However, Apple also knows that stealing an iPhone display model would be a pretty pointless exercise. Ads by Google First, an alarm would sound as the immoral idiot stealing the iPhone display model left the store. At which point security would pounce on them. And, even if they did manage to get away with their illicit booty intact, Apple would simply brick the iPhone from afar by placing it in Lost Mode using Find My iPhone How To Use Find My iPhone To Get Your Stolen iPhone Back How To Use Find My iPhone To Get Your Stolen iPhone Back Long story short: my wife had her iPhone stolen when she misplaced it at work the other day.

But it’s sure to roll it out to other stores in the future. So just remember not to walk out of your local Apple Store with an iPhone in your pocket. Whether accidentally or on purpose. What do you think of this effort to improve the overall Apple Store experience? Are you more likely to buy an iPhone you can handle without having to wrestle with a security tether? What would you do if you saw someone stealing an iPhone from an Apple Store? Please let us know in the comments below!

"Hey, where are all the iPhones?" "Uh....I think that dude over there has them." "All of them?" "Yes. He wanted to see how all of them felt in his pockets." OK. So this probably won't happen, but don't you think it's weird to potentially have to walk up to someone and ask if it can be your turn to see an iPhone. I'm sure there will be controls in-place, but it does make you think. Reply James Bruce October 17, 2016 at 12:40 pm I'd say it's pretty cunning PR move: "Look, our phones are so useless to thieves that we're gonna let anyone steal them to try". I know from experience that you *can* recover a stolen iPhone using Find my Phone, and it works. I knew before my wife called me that her phone had been stolen, and I was following it on a map until I had their address. Reply Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Won't Benefit Much from Samsung's Note 7 Disaster Either way, investors have already benefited from the storyline. Evan Niu (TMFNewCow) Oct 17, 2016 at 4:52PM iPhone 7 Plus dual-camera system. Image source: Apple. In the wake of Samsung's Galaxy Note 7 disaster, the prevailing sentiment has been that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands to be one of the key beneficiaries. The iPhone 7 Plus is a pretty compelling alternative phablet to the Note 7, and Android switcher rates continue to rise, according to Apple execs on every conference call. A direct rival's loss should be the Mac maker's gain, right? Not so fast. Word on the Street Nomura analyst Jeffrey Kvaal has put out a research note (via Tech Trader Daily) that suggests Apple may not be as big of a beneficiary as you might think. Contrary to popular thinking, Kvaal does not expect any material upside related to the Galaxy Note 7 recalls and subsequent discontinuation. The analyst cites strong loyalty among Samsung customers, based on reports that 80% to 90% of customers returning a Note 7 are picking another Samsung device as a replacement. It's usually the Galaxy S7 Edge that people are picking. It does so happen that Samsung is offering $75 promotions for people to stick with the brand, a move that could very well be paying off. On top of that, it's not like consumers can readily get their hands on an iPhone 7 Plus, which remains heavily supply constrained. While the smaller iPhone 7 has better availability, the 5.5-inch model is rather hard to come by and new orders don't ship for three to four weeks. Customers that are returning the Note 7 need a replacement phone now, and can't wait that long. Overall, Kvaal is still quite bullish on Apple, maintaining a buy rating alongside a $135 price target. A second opinion In contrast, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo does believe that Apple will grab some defectors. Kuo is expecting Apple to win an additional 5 million to 7 million iPhone 7 unit sales from consumers coming off a Note 7. The dual-camera system could be a strong selling feature, and the analyst believes many users will be disenchanted with Samsung after the ordeal. These estimates are just the latest guesses to come from the Street. Earlier estimates ranged anywhere from 8 million to 15 million incremental iPhone sales that Apple could grab. It's also not as if we'll be able to go back and track how many buyers actually did switch, so I wouldn't worry too much about the specific unit estimates. Still, just the likelihood that Apple will be able to poach some Note 7 users has reinvigorated the broader iPhone 7 optimism that has pushed Apple shares higher over the past month. The stock is now trading near 52-week highs after stumbling for most of 2016. Investors have already benefited quite a bit from the debacle. Evan Niu, CFA owns shares of Apple.

Ruslan Salakhutdinov, an associate professor at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, will assume the new position, which is meant to help the company make sure that Siri and its other products make use of the fundamental breakthroughs coming out of academic AI research. Salakhutdinov will talk about his research at EmTech MIT 2016, an MIT Technology Review conference held this week. Salakhutdinov researches very large neural networks used in a technology called deep learning, which lets a computer learn to perform a difficult task by consuming copious training examples. He will continue to work part time at CMU and will hire a team of researchers to work with him at Apple. The move is part of Apple’s effort to catch up in the race with Google, Facebook, Amazon, and other tech companies to gain an edge through recent advances in AI and machine learning. In particular, it is becoming increasingly important that software be able to learn for itself how to perform a task, using techniques like deep learning. The latest AI techniques are used in Google’s new smartphone, Pixel, for example. Its voice helper, called Assistant, will go head to head with Apple’s Siri, using machine learning to try to understand users’ spoken queries. Excited about joining Apple as a director of AI research in addition to my work at CMU. Apply to work with my teamhttps://t.co/U2hQl2GdhA— Russ Salakhutdinov (@rsalakhu) October 17, 2016 Salakhutdinov’s work on cutting-edge machine-learning techniques could help drive progress in AI, and it could be applied in many different areas, including computer vision, natural language processing, and even robotics. Speaking recently, Salakhutdinov said that there are three big areas where AI is progressing: giving computers better language understanding; enabling them to learn through repetition and positive reinforcement; and developing ways for machines to learn from unlabeled data. He also highlighted the work he’s doing on teaching machines to learn from unstructured data on the Web, something that could conceivably help make a product like Siri more intelligent. “We’re working on the idea of trying to use external knowledge bases,” he said. “If I ask you something about a particular thing, can your system basically go to Wikipedia, read a few different articles, learn some facts about the world, and provide you with the right answer?” Salakhutdinov’s recent work has also focused on enabling machines to learn from different sorts of data, and on ways for things learned in one context to be applied in a completely new one—areas known, respectively, as multimodal learning and transfer learning. He also collaborated on a project that showed, by taking inspiration from cognitive science, how computers can learn from relatively small amounts of data (see “This AI Algorithm Learns Simple Tasks as Fast as We Do”). In recent years, competitors such as Google and Facebook have hired leading figures in deep learning to lead their AI efforts. Apple has a much less prominent AI research effort than competitors, and some have suggested that its traditional secrecy has made it difficult for the company to recruit the best researchers in the field. Deep learning has gained prominence in recent years, after proving spectacularly good at enabling machines to recognize objects in images and spoken words in audio. Google and Facebook use the technology to automatically caption images. And it has made Siri and other voice-activated products better at recognizing words. Parsing the meaning of those words remains a grander challenge, however (see “AI’s Language Problem”). Weren't able to make it to EmTech? We've got you covered.

Based on recently published emails, Philip Elmer-DeWitt over at Apple 3.0 reports that Cook in mid-2015 had a private meeting with John Podesta, formerly Bill Clinton's Chief of Staff and the current chairman of Hillary Clinton's 2016 Presidential campaign. DON'T MISS: A month with the iPhone 7 Details surrounding Cook's meeting with Podesta were unearthed in the wake of Wikileaks publishing thousands of emails from Podesta's private Gmail account. Elmer-DeWitt provides some context for the emails and the parties involved: The meeting came up in a hacked e-mail exchange conducted in late June 2015 between Podesta, former Google executive and current Clinton CTO Stephanie Hannon, and chief fundraiser Lindsay Roitman. Also mentioned is Erika Rottenberg, former LinkedIn general counsel, who was hosting a fundraiser that week. As for the content of the emails, one exchange sees fundraising wizard Lindsay Roitman advise both Podesta and Hannon that they shouldn't come on too strong with Cook given his relative inexperience in the political sphere. The full email reads: Tim’s office requested a 1:1 meeting today, which was a nice way of saying “no staff”.   I think this is one we should proceed cautiously. He’s supportive but new to this so I think we shouldn’t come on too strong. Steph, thanks for circling back, see you tomorrow night. While the specific topics covered in the meeting remain unknown, some hot-button tech topics referenced in other Podesta emails include the proper balance between surveillance and national security, patent reform and net neutrality. On a final note, it's worth noting that Cook two months ago held a fundraiser for Hillary Clinton where tickets ranged anywhere from $,2700 to $50,000. All of the proceeds were earmarked for the Hillary Victory Fund.

A detailed new report from Bloomberg details the recent goings on at Apple’s top secret ‘Project Titan’, including upheaval in the management ranks and a mass exodus of engineers. An unidentified source has told the business publication that hundreds of employees assigned to the project have either been let go, reallocated elsewhere in the company, or walked. Another source says that head count has been kept roughly the same thanks to new members joining from elsewhere within Apple. Originally conceived in 2014 as a revolutionary electric vehicle with either a semi-autonomous or fully autonomous driving system, the project has now been scaled back to a self-driving car platform that will be on-sold or licensed out. Project leaders have reportedly been given a deadline of the end of 2017 to prove the architecture’s viability, and to outline a case for further progress. Above: Apple ‘Project Titan’ test mule. Battles about the project’s direction — whether it should be a complete car or just a platform — began surfacing in 2015, and came to the fore this year. Steve Zadesky, formerly an engineer at Ford, headed up ‘Project Titan’ until early 2016 when he was effectively replaced by Bob Mansfield, who was brought out of semi-retirement and was involved in the development of the first-generation iPad. The issues reportedly encountered by Apple during the time when ‘Project Titan’ was envisioned as a challenger to the Tesla Model S included the complex regulatory environment, and difficulties in accepting the low margin nature of the automobile market. Another key problem was the automotive supply chain. Bloomberg believes that suppliers were unwilling to commit to delivering low quantities of highly specialised parts to Apple. Unlike their counterparts in the tech world, they couldn’t be bullied into lowering costs or offering exclusive access.

Russ Salakhutdinov said on Monday that he’s joining the Cupertino, California-based company as a director of AI research, in addition to his role at the university. He posted a link to an Apple job application page seeking machine learning specialists. Apple is seeking scientists with “experience in Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Optimization, and/or Data Mining,” it said in the job listing. The iPhone maker has been on an acquisition spree to beef up its artificial intelligence capabilities over the past 12 months, buying at least a half-dozen startups including Seattle-based Turi Inc. Apple’s penchant for secrecy has burdened efforts to improve AI offerings and hire the best talent. That’s because researchers in the field like to publish their findings, something Apple has frowned upon in the past. Machine learning has gained mounting importance for tech companies to improve their research and enable virtual assistants such as Siri to better anticipate and predict users’ needs. Siri is competing with the Google Assistant, Microsoft’s Cortana and Amazon’s Alexa to become the virtual assistant of choice and the access point for users seeking online services. Salakhutdinov joined Carnegie Mellon, a respected AI research centre, earlier this year after spells at the University of Toronto and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. His research has been funded by Google, Microsoft and Samsung Electronics, among others, according to his personal website at the Pittsburgh-based university. Salakhutdinov has published extensively on neural networks, a branch of AI critical for voice and image recognition technology, collaborating with top researchers from academia and Google parent Alphabet Inc.   Most Popular Viewed 1 China’s 30-year long march to its biggest ever rocket launch 2 China’s most powerful rocket lifts off from island launch centre 3 China, Russia join the crowded sky: widebody planes to cut reliance on Airbus, Boeing 4 Two-thirds of smartphone users now paying by mobile 5 6 ways parents in Hong Kong and everywhere can help teens addicted to mobiles Shared 1 China’s 30-year long march to its biggest ever rocket launch 2 Two-thirds of smartphone users now paying by mobile 3 China’s most powerful rocket lifts off from island launch centre 4 6 ways parents in Hong Kong and everywhere can help teens addicted to mobiles 5 China, Russia join the crowded sky: widebody planes to cut reliance on Airbus, Boeing Commented 1 Beijing interpretation on Legislative Council oath taking rattles Hong Kong 2 Hong Kong oath-taking saga shows ugly side of city’s colonial legacy 3 Mainland paper slams Hong Kong independence advocates in 1,000-word commentary 4 Youngspiration duo increasingly isolated by pan-democratic allies, as antics cause harm and chaos 5 Time to resume talks, Taiwanese president tells the mainland Promotions Order your FREE copy of the MICE BIZ 2016 2H       You may also like China How new Xinjiang party boss became front runner in race to be one of China’s most powerful men 30 Oct 2016 - 11:24pm 2 Shaping up: Home-grown app, Green WALK Hong Kong, is the pick of the mobile apps In partnership with: HKT PREMIER Why bankers and cocaine are best of friends 30 Oct 2016 - 8:46pm 9 American Express corporate payment solutions help businesses drive savings for growth Presented by: American Express Hong Kong Illegal fees, little rest and no documents: domestic helpers in Hong Kong continue to fight for their rights 30 Oct 2016 - 8:07am 21 Hong Kong Should history lessons in schools include details about Hong Kong’s 1967 riots? 30 Oct 2016 - 10:29pm 9 China A billion billion calculations per second: where no computer has gone before 29 Oct 2016 - 8:00am 4 Hong Kong Meet Viveca Chow, Broadway musical star from Hong Kong Oct 28th 2016, 11:57pm World Plane bursts into flame at Chicago airport Oct 29th 2016, 3:45pm China China has world’s most skewed sex ratio at birth – again 27 Oct 2016 - 10:04pm 2 Post Magazine The Asian men who buy sex with Cambodian virgins 28 Oct 2016 - 10:54am 3 Post Magazine With the paedophile-hunters on the streets of Phnom Penh 28 Oct 2016 - 10:55am 1 South China Morning Post Stay connected Facebook Twitter Hong Kong Politics Economy Health & Environment Law & Crime Education & Community News China Hong Kong Asia World China Policies & Politics Diplomacy & Defence Money & Wealth Society Economy Tech Business Companies Markets Property Investor Relations Mutual Funds Economy China Economy Money & Wealth Country Reports Tech China Tech Enterprises Social & Gadgets Start-ups Apps & Gaming Innovation Leaders & Founders Science & Research E-Commerce Lifestyle Arts & Entertainment Health & Beauty Film & TV Food & Drink Families Music Fashion & Luxury Books Travel & Leisure Watches Sport Hong Kong China Golf Racing Rugby Soccer Tennis Boxing Comment Insight & Opinion Harry's View Blogs Polls Letters Multimedia Video Photos Infographics SCMP Chronicles Magazine Post Magazine Style Good Eating Destination Macau HK Magazine Archive Other Weather Most Popular 7 Days Index Country Reports Crossword Promotions Directories Luxehomes At your service Business Services Directory MICE Biz Restaurant Directory Information Buy SCMP Photos Copyright Licensing RSS Feeds SCMP.com search Historical Archive Print Subscription Advertising Opportunities Contact our Advertising Sales HK Rate card Overseas Rate Card China Rate Card The Marketer SCMP Marketing Solutions SCMP Outdoor Advertising Recruitment Advertising Events SCMP Events Operation Santa Claus Other Sites CPJobs.com Education Post Young Post Cosmopolitan CosmoGIRL!

The Pixel XL's closest relative is the Huawei-manufactured, Google-overseen Nexus 6P. What are the differences between last year's well-reviewed Nexus 6P and the first phablet to bear the Google name? Size If the Pixel is XL, then the Nexus 6P is ... jumbo? The 6P is nearly 3-percent taller and wider than the Pixel, though they are of equal thickness. Both phones fall squarely in phablet territory, with big screens great for internet use and video playback, but are perhaps too large to fit comfortably in smaller hands or tote along during a workout. Weight While the Nexus is just a little bit larger, it's almost 6-percent heavier. Build Both phones are built with an aircraft-grade aluminum unibody. Pixel's take is a little more understated and minimal, with a simple "G" logo and a glossy section at the top portion of the back. The Nexus 6P is more adventurous, with a glassy black camera bump-out and prominent branding. Colors Both phones stick to the neutral/metallic color palette we're used to seeing in smartphones. The Nexus has more options, but Pixel offers a blue color, which is the most novel variant of the bunch. Water resistance Even though this year's flagships from Apple and Samsung both have water resistance ratings, these Google-spawned phones need to stay high and dry. Display size The few millimeters in extra height and width afford the Nexus a 3.5-percent larger display. Display resolution Both displays have 2,560 x 1,400 Quad HD resolution. Since the Pixel has a smaller display, its pixels are slightly more dense. Display type Both flagships choose AMOLED technology over IPS displays. Pressure-sensitive display Unlike Apple, Android manufacturers have yet to incorporate pressure-sensitive displays into their phones. Apple uses this technology to enable 3D Touch, a navigational feature that prompts different shortcuts depending on how hard you press the touchscreen. Camera megapixels Google touts the Pixel's camera as the "highest rated smartphone camera. Ever." But until we take a few test shots, it's unclear how it surpasses the very good camera in last year's Nexus 6P, with which it shares several matching specs. Camera aperture (rear) Camera aperture has a big impact on how well a smartphone is able to shoot in low light conditions. Both of these phones have a f/2.0 aperture. Although that's fairly large, it's not industry-leading. Optical image stabilization Optical image stabilization is conspicuously absent from these phones. When it comes to battling camera shake and unwanted photo blur, you'll need either an exceptionally steady hand or a stable stand to shoot from. Dual-lens camera Both of these cameras have standard single-lens rear cameras, so don't look for the kind of dual-lens engineering seen in the iPhone 7 Plus or Huawei Honor 8. Battery Although these two batteries look identical (both are a rather large 3,450 mAh size) their estimated battery life does not compare. Pixel XL users can expect up to 32 hours of talk time and up to 14 hours of internet use or video playback. On the other hand, Nexus 6P offers up to 23 hours of talk time and up to 10 hours of internet use or video playback. Clearly, battery size alone does not a long-lived smartphone make. Charging/data port Both phones use the newer, reversible USB-C port over proprietary cables like Apple's Lightning or older technology like microUSB. Fast charging According to Google, the Pixel XL will get up to seven hours of use from a 15-minute charge. Nexus 6P makes the same claim, but in 10 minutes of charging. Wireless charging Nexus has toyed with wireless charging in the past, but that feature didn't make the cut for either of these phones. Processor The Pixel XL has a newer Snapdragon chip with a higher clock speed. RAM The Pixel is also better equipped for rigorous software applications, with 4-gigabytes of RAM to the 6P's 3-gigabytes. Internal storage Both phones are available in 32- and 128-gigabyte sizes. The Nexus adds an intermediary 64-gigabyte option as well. External storage Serious Android users may be vexed to learn that neither of these devices have expandable storage. The Samsung Galaxy S7 series may be your best option if you need microSD to manage your content. VR-ready VR compatibility is one of the major differentiators between these two flagships. Thanks in part to its updated processor and ample RAM, Pixel XL is Google Daydream-ready out of the box. The Nexus 6P should not be considered Daydream-ready. This may come as a surprise, considering that the 6P is currently the only supported headset phone in the Daydream development kit. But as Google tells developers, the "6P's thermal performance is not representative of the consumer Daydream-ready phones ... expect the 6P to thermally throttle CPU and performance after a short period of use, depending on workload." Headphone jack No need to plan for a new set of earbuds or an intermediary adapter. These phones have the tried-and-true designated headphone jack. Fingerprint sensor It's safe to say that fingerprint sensors are sticking around for the foreseeable future. Both phones place theirs on the back. Home button Neither phone has a physical home button. Instead, the home buttons are onscreen, taking up a small bit of real estate at the bottom of the display. Mobile payments Both phones are NFC-equipped, so you can use Android Pay at participating retailers. Virtual assistant Google Assistant is another one of the Pixel's distinguishing characteristics. The Pixel and Pixel XL are the first phone to have this spiffed-up Siri alternative built in. From what we can tell, Google Assistant is a more ambitious version of Google Now. We'll certainly include our thoughts on Google Assistant when we post our full-length review of the Pixel in the near future. Operating system As the first Google-branded phone, the Pixel is at the forefront of Android operating system updates. It launches with Android 7.1, the absolute latest in Nougat. It is guaranteed to receive all software updates for two years and security updates for three years (from launch). Prior to Pixel, Nexus always carried the torch for Android software releases. In the near future, we expect it to continue to be ahead of the curve, even if it is a little behind the Pixels. As of now, Nexus 6P is still running 7.0 Nougat, with a 7.1 update expected near the end of the year. Release Pixels are just starting to ship now. Nexus 6P is already a year old. Starting price (full retail) Based on specs alone, these two phones are quite competitive. That's why it can be downright surprising to discover that Pixel XL is almost US$200 more than the Nexus 6P. And that's based on full retail pricing – now that the Nexus is a year old, it can easily be found at a discount. On paper, the Pixel's biggest advantages are Google Assistant, VR compatibility and a little more processing power. It may be easy to dismiss those features in favor of a little extra cash in your wallet, especially considering that when all is said and done, the Nexus 6P is an excellent phone. However, we do expect the Pixel to have some advantages that don't translate into facts and figures. Since it's the first phone to bear the Google banner, we are eager to see if it provides a hardware/software harmony that edges out other Android environments and challenges Apple's iOS walled garden.

Talk about having courage. Following its bold and ballsy decision to remove the headphone jack from its latest iPhone, Apple is getting rid of something else: security tethers in its retail stores. That's right, kleptomaniacs: If you want an iPhone for free, there's nothing beyond your own morals and the law stopping you from going to an Apple store and taking one. The Cupertino tech giant this weekend reopened the doors of its newly renovated Regent Street store in London, England, where visitors can play around with the latest iPhones without unsightly and cumbersome security cables getting in the way, according to CNET. //Related Articles Angry Customer Smashes Devices in French Apple Store "Apple says this is to allow people to hold them properly, try cases on them and even see how they feel in your pocket," CNET reports. If you try to take off with one, an alarm will sound and Apple will brick the device. According to MacRumors, Apple is also offering this tether-free environment at its Yorkdale store in Toronto, Canada, and at two other stores in the UK. Whether Apple will unhook its iPhones at stores here in the US remains to be seen. Meanwhile, Apple recently opened the doors of its new retail store in the heart of Silicon Valley.

Evan Niu (TMFNewCow) Oct 17, 2016 at 3:34PM Image source: Apple. It's been about two years since Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) reportedly greenlit Project Titan, its secretive electric car project. Over that time, investors have seen a steady stream of leaks regarding the status of the project. Just over the past couple of months, there seems to be doubt as to whether or not the company actually wants to build a car. Instead, Apple is said to be changing the strategic direction, perhaps pursuing a very un-Apple strategy of focusing only on autonomous driving software instead of an integrated package. Bloomberg is out with a fresh report this morning, reiterating this theme and providing additional details. A fork in the road The current thinking within the Project Titan team does not include physically building an Apple Car. Instead, Apple is indeed focusing more heavily on making an autonomous driving system. However, the tech titan is keeping the idea of designing its own car on the table for now. The company has set an internal deadline of late next year to make the final call of which direction to take. In no uncertain terms, Project Titan sounds like a mess. The team's leadership has faltered and turned over, there is disarray around what strategic direction is best, there have been rounds of job cuts and resignations, and there would be significant margin dilution concerns for investors. If Apple does choose to build a car, it would have to face the incredible capital inefficiency associated with automotive manufacturing. Be more like Alphabet? If the challenges associated with building a car prove insurmountable and Apple indeed only pursues the software route, its strategy would more closely resemble Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL). Of course, Google has been working on its own self-driving car project for the past seven years, giving it quite a head start. Over that time, Google has now accumulated 2 million miles of self-driving experience for its vehicles, which primarily rely on LIDAR systems to perceive the environment. Google recognized early on how hard auto manufacturing is, and as such has chosen to partner with existing companies to build limited numbers of prototypes. It should be clear that once Google feels that its autonomous technology is ready, it would choose to license the technology to other companies instead of building the vehicles and selling them to consumers. That would be the platform play, which worked wonders with Android. Unlike Android, Google could probably extract a hefty licensing fee since cars are so expensive. Alternatively, it could use the Android-esque strategy of offering the software for free in order to grab as much market share as possible. But licensing software to run on other people's hardware is about as un-Apple as it gets, and it goes against Apple's core principle of designing integrated hardware and software. For now, Apple's car dreams appear utterly lost. Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors. Evan Niu, CFA owns shares of Apple.

Salakhutdinov says he is excited to join Apple as a director of AI research, even as he continues his work at CMU. He also extended an invitation to other researchers to join his team. The Register understands that since the summer Salakhutdinov has been working with Apple on a part-time basis – one day a week, essentially – as part of an effort to improve the company's relationship with academia. Last year, Bloomberg reported that Apple's culture of secrecy made it harder for the company to recruit technical talent from academic institutions, where the publication of research and the sharing of information is critical for professional recognition and advancement. At the time, Apple researchers had not published a single academic research paper on AI. Meanwhile, the iThing maker had 42 open positions that mentioned artificial intelligence on its job website and 120 that mentioned machine learning. Presently, Apple has 56 open positions that list artificial intelligence and 129 that include machine learning. Technology companies like Apple, Google, IBM, Intel, and Salesforce have been buying up AI startups at a rapid pace in an effort to integrate AI-related technology – machine learning, computer vision, and the like – into products and services. Apple this year acquired machine learning companies Turi and Tuplejump. Its 2010 acquisition of Siri remains its highest-profile investment in AI. And its recently curtailed self-driving car initiative, Project Titan, also depends upon AI. According to research firm CB Insights, there have been 140 acquisitions of AI-oriented startups since 2011. Apple, however, has not been active in releasing AI-related software. While Baidu, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft have released projects like Warp-CTC, FBLearner Flow, TensorFlow, and CNTK – releases that mix altruism with cloud business lead generation – Apple has kept its AI technology to itself. Late last month, Amazon, Google, Facebook, IBM, and Microsoft announced the formation of the Partnership on Artificial Intelligence to Benefit People and Society, a group that aims to benefit businesses investing in AI by influencing the development and regulation of cognitive technology. Apple remains conspicuously absent from this group. Apple's decision to open source the Swift programming language last year suggests the company isn't entirely hermetic. Asked about this, Apple did not respond to a request for comment. ® Sponsored: The state of mobile security maturity Tips and corrections 3 Comments More from The Register Dell/Quest Software plans layoffs and relocations – source Some products may go, too, once private equiteers take over 3 Comments Springpath to focus on Cisco OEM development Go-to-market machine is in gear 2 Comments Liberal Party of Australia: why are you paying so much for ancient software?

An Apple store in New York. Credit: Victor J. Blue/Bloomberg Most Popular The days of just selling stuff are long gone. Today, in the race for consumers, marketers need to create entire, cohesive ecosystems in order to provide the most value. Brand consultancy Interbrand recently released its 2016 Best Global Brands report, ranking the top 100 most valuable brands for the 17th time. For the fourth year in a row, Apple and Google snagged the top spots—Apple's brand value rose 5% to $178,1 million, and Google's grew 11% to $133.3 million, Interbrand found. But the report found that a big part of what makes brands like Apple valuable is their cohesiveness as a connected business system. Apple communicates with its customers through its hardware, software, and retail stores to deliver one consistent narrative or ecosystem, said Josh Feldmeth, chief executive, North America at Interbrand. Related Stories One-Fifth of Apple iOS Users Avoid Ad Targeting in Apps: Report Amazon's New Music-Streaming Service Goes Up Against Spotify, Apple A Crisis Gone to Waste: Why Samsung Shouldn't Have Canceled ANA Presentation "These companies are growing because they're building ecosystems around human beings and natural behavior—it's about adding a set of products and services that are relevant but doing it in a connected way," he said, noting that the issue has risen in importance in recent years with the increase in digital and social media. "With brands like Apple and Amazon, or any of these amazing ecosystems, the deeper you go or the longer you stay, the more value you receive as a customer, and that's how they're driving growth." Car companies are also trying to evolve their technology to offer more solutions to shoppers. Interbrand chart Credit: Interbrand According to an Interbrand chart, the most cohesive brands are Apple, Colgate, and Adobe. Google is a little less cohesive, and Xerox, is in the least cohesive realm. Mr. Feldmeth noted that being cohesive can be challenging for marketers. "In a more linear model, marketers could operate more or less independently," he said, noting they were under pressure from C-suite colleagues but that was it. Today, they need to "integrate functionally around the customer," which requires collaboration, interdisciplinary skill sets and technology fluency, he said. Interbrand found that, in addition to Apple and Google, the top five most-valuable brands included Coca Cola, Microsoft and Toyota. Tesla and Dior made the list for the first time this year.

October 17 AAPL: 117.55 -0.08 Apple releases iOS 10.1 beta 4 with Portrait camera for iPhone 7 Plus Greg Barbosa - 4 weeks ago @gregbarbosa iPhone iOS 10.1 View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Apple has released the fourth iOS 10.1 beta which includes the Portrait camera for iPhone 7 Plus that applies a DSLR-like blur effect over photos using the dual lens system. iOS 10.1 beta 4 is available to registered developers. The fourth beta is also available to public beta testers on iOS 10.1 today. Portrait mode is a feature that was demonstrated at Apple’s keynote earlier this month, but the major new feature wasn’t ready for primetime when the iPhone 7 Plus initially launched. Portrait still isn’t in the release versions of iOS, but developer and public betas released last month include a beta version of the feature which works well already. Aside from Portrait mode, we noted the changes includes in the first beta last month: There’s a new toggle setting in Accessibility called Auto-play Message Effects. This is related to Reduce Motion disabling Messages bubble and screen effects but the functionality does not seem to be implemented yet. According to the developer release notes, iOS 10.1 includes a fix for motion handling. Developers will be able to access barometric pressure data for iPad Air 2, iPad mini 4 and iPad Pro. For the impressive new Portrait mode in Camera, we went hands on with the new feature using the beta in our initial walkthrough. Zac also wrote about the new feature here and took some example images here. Check out Jeff Benjamin’s video demonstration below: The previous version, iOS 10.1 beta 2, included changes to Messages and other bug fixes. Although iOS 10.1 beta 4’s release notes don’t note any new features or changes, be sure to let us know if you find anything!

Registered developers can download the new iOS 10.1 beta from the Apple Developer Center or over-the-air once the proper configuration profile is installed. Public beta testers can download the update over-the-air after installing the configuration profile from Apple's beta testing website. iOS 10.1 introduces a new "Portrait" mode for the iPhone 7 Plus that allows it to use the two built-in cameras to create shallow depth of field portrait photos with blurred backgrounds. Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel for more videos. To achieve the blurred look, the image signal processor in the iPhone 7 Plus uses the wide-angle camera to create a depth map, dissecting the different layers of the photo to decide what to blur. It works on people, pets, and objects, but does require good lighting to achieve the proper effect. The update also likely includes bug fixes and other under-the-hood improvements to address issues that have been uncovered since iOS 10 was released, such as an ongoing CallKit bug that has caused CallKit to function unreliably. iOS 10 has been described by Apple as the "biggest release ever" for iOS users, with features that include a redesigned Lock screen, a Siri SDK to allow third-party apps to integrate with Siri, and a completely overhauled Messages app with stickers, a full App Store, Digital Touch, Bubble Effects, and more. Other features include a dedicated "Home" app for HomeKit users, new facial and object recognition capabilities in Photos, and redesigned Maps and Apple Music apps.

It bugs me that I type something, use a character like a comma, and after hitting space it doesn't switch to a letter. It stays on the punctuation keyboard. Also, safari doesn't auto scroll comment boxes when posting replies. That's not a big issue since I can just zoom out, but for some it may bother them. Rating: 10 Votes swordfish5736 4 weeks ago Anytime I open the multitasking tray or close apps, I have a terrible lag between when I push the home button and the phone actually performing the task. My wife's 7 has no issues at all, it's very responsive. I also have the connectivity issues that this release is supposed to correct. Do you use the triple click accessibility shortcut? If so thats what causes it, the phone is waiting to see if you are going to click the button a third time.

Not likely, why bother with 10.0.3, if 10.1 is done. Rating: 4 Votes C DM 4 weeks ago Apple used to be known for flawless software. Now they only release software with tons of bugs. Things were never flawless. Some people had that idea because they didn't run into issues themselves or because they just heard of things, but the reality is that there have always been issues here or there for various people.

Rating: 2 Votes DavisEngeler 4 weeks ago Holy crap, thanks for the advice about disabling the triple-click accessibility shortcut. I've been annoyed by the slow animation speed for a long time now. More than a year I'd say. Never thought about the fact that it's waiting for a third press and causing it to feel sluggish.

Apple Seeds Fourth iOS 10.1 Beta, iOS 10.0.3 for iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus GO iOS 10.0.3 update addresses Verizon LTE connectivity issues Oct 17, 2016 20:15 GMT  ·  By Marius Nestor  ·  Share:  Today, October 17, 2016, Apple seeded the fourth Beta build of the upcoming iOS 10.1 mobile operating system for supported iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch devices to developers enrolled in the Apple Developer program, as well as public beta testers. iOS 10.1 Beta 4 comes exactly one week after the release of the third Beta build, and it introduces the brand-new Portrait camera functionality for iPhone 7 Plus devices, allowing users to finally take amazing photos with a bokeh effect (clear and sharp front subject with out-of-focus background). As mentioned before, the fourth Beta build is now available for both public beta testers and application developers with a paid account, who can download it via OTA updates on their registered devices, as well as IPSW images from the Downloads section of their Apple Developer account. Two builds are available, 14B72 and 14B72b. iOS 10.0.3 out now for iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus devices If you're new to the iOS 10 Public Beta program and you'd like to try out the upcoming iOS 10.1 operating system on your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch devices, we've prepared an in-depth tutorial that will help you achieve just that. However, please make sure to first make a backup of all your important files, as iOS 10.1 is not a stable release yet, and you may end up with an unresponsive device or a buggy iOS experience. In related news, Apple pushed earlier today the third maintenance update to the iOS 10.0 series of the mobile operating system in an attempt to fix LTS connectivity issues for iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus devices that users of the Verizon mobile network reported lately. Again, the iOS 10.0.3 update is available only for iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. #iOS 10.1 Beta 4#iOS 10.1 Public Beta 4#Apple#iOS 10.0.3#iPhone 7 subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Apple Has a Backup Solution If the iPhone 7 Home Button Breaks Down Apple to Officially Kill Off the iPhone 4 on October 31 Apple Workers Accused of Taking and Sharing Close-up Photos of Female Customers Apple Seeds Third Developer Beta of watchOS 3.1 Apple Watch Operating System Five Great Calendar Apps for Android HP Elite X3 with Windows 10 Mobile: The PC Experience Motorola DROID Turbo 3 with 16MP Hasselblad Camera Leaks in Press Renders New Photo of the x86 Windows 10 Mobile Phone Gets Leaked Nikon Updates Firmware for Its COOLPIX A300 Camera - Get Version 1.2 Microsoft Releases Interactive Mail Notifications for All Windows 10 Users KDE Neon Users Urged to Upgrade Their Systems or Reinstall the Linux Distro Budgie 11 Desktop Environment to Feature a Dock Mode for the Panel, Richer UI - Exclusive    iOS 10.1 Beta 4 released new ios apps NeuroNation: Train your brain to improve your memory and focus with NeuroNation Flipagram: Create cool videos by mixing up your photos with music Timer+: Set up dozens of timers and control them all with ease Nutshell Camera: Create some pretty cool videos with Nutshell Camera IKEA Catalogue: Check out the IKEA Catalogue for more than just furniture Complete: Complete puts a social twist to your regular to-do list/ task manager WebMD Baby: WebMD Baby offers help in how to best tend to your baby Reader comments Apple Seeds Second Beta of iOS 10.2, watchOS 3.1.1 & tvOS 10.1, Adds New TV App more on: iOS 10.2 Beta 2 i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

But despite rounds of layoffs and shifting gears on the scope of its Project Titan, Apple seems to have finally zeroed in on what it should be, what it shouldn't, and when it should be ready. MORE: 10 Best High-Tech Cars on the Road According to an in-depth report by Bloomberg, Apple execs have given the remaining team a deadline of late 2017 "to prove the feasibility of its self-driving system and to decide on a final direction for the project." Note that this deadline isn't for a final shipping product. It's for figuring out where Apple is going next. But that direction seems fairly clear at this point. We're likely not talking about a vehicle but the brains for one. Although more than 120 software engineers have reportedly been cut, those who are still on board are working on testing an underlying platform that other automakers could use. The ingredients for Project Titan include autonomous programs, vision sensors and various simulators. It's possible that Apple may still decide to move forward with an actual car, but the company seems to be gearing up to take on Tesla's Autopilot by teaming up with other automakers who want to compete in a world that's moving towards self-driving vehicles. The problem is that several other companies, including GM, Volvo and Audi, have their own self-driving systems. For instance, Uber worked with Volvo to roll out self-driving vehicles for a test in Pittsburgh, PA. Meanwhile, Google already has years of self-driving experience under its belt for its own fleet of cars. Come this time next year, we should have a much clearer picture of what the Apple Car will be, but the company may have a difficult time holding on to the talent it needs to cross the finish line.

Bringing iOS 10 to version 10.0.3, it seems like the firmware update is particularly useful for Verizon customers. According to the Verge, iOS 10.0.3 was rolled out mainly to fix the LTE connectivity issues experienced by iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus owners on Verizon. “Apple released an iOS update today to address the complaints of thousands of Verizon customers who were experiencing signal drops and unexplainable issues with GPS when using the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus,” the report specified. Complaints were reported late last month that the iPhone 7 units on Verizon were erratically dropping the LTE signal, reverting to 3G or 2G connection, or showing the “No Service” icon when users try to use Waze or Google Maps. It seemed like the problem has something to do with the phone’s interaction with the Verizon network, with theories that it could be how the Big Red “handles transmitting voice and cellular data simultaneously,” the Verge further explained. Based on how frequently I am without service now, having already replaced the phone once: I must recommend against buying a Verizon iPhone 7 pic.twitter.com/a77SbDahli — Kristian Claus (@KristianClaus) October 7, 2016 .@verizon admits known issues of iPhone 7 unable to stay on LTE. My $700 phone continually on 3G. Says it can’t offer bill credit. — Christopher J. Ortiz (@ChrisJOrtiz) October 12, 2016 This iPhone 7 Verizon LTE issue is getting annoying. Often find I'm on 3G until I cycle airplane mode. Anyone else? — Chris Wagner (@cwagdev) October 7, 2016 It was mentioned by Apple Insider that the issue was also experienced by some AT&T customers though not that rampant compared to those subscribed under Verizon. A temporary fix discovered was to toggle the “Enable LTE” function to “Data Only” in the settings menu, but with the iOS 10.0.3 update now available for the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, the LTE connection should already work smoothly. [Image by Joe Raedle/Getty Images] The firmware update is available only to Apple’s newest smartphone offering, which means those who own previous iPhone models will not receive the update. To install iOS 10.0.3, head to the Settings panel of the smartphone and then select General. Tap Software Update to start the download and installation of the firmware with build number 14A551. Another way to access iOS 10.0.3 is to connect the iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus to iTunes on a Mac or PC. Another major iOS update is expected to arrive soon to iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, and other compatible Apple devices. iOS 10.1 is currently in testing, with the beta version now available to registered developers and public testers. A previous report from the Inquisitr noted that one of the biggest highlights of iOS 10.1 will bring in a new feature to the iPhone 7 Plus’ camera. The forthcoming version of iOS 10 is set to add Portrait mode in the camera settings of the bigger iPhone 7 variant. Through the bokeh effect, which results in having a blurred background and more focused subject, the mode allows users to take better photos using the dual camera setup of the rear-facing primary shooter. <noscript><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/H5drvRTBuqk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></noscript> Apple has yet to announce the official release date of iOS 10.1, but it is reportedly coming later this October. For non-developers wanting to experience iOS 10.1 as early as now, the first step needed to access the beta is to sign up with Apple’s official Beta Software Program. Enroll the iOS device afterward. Tech website GSM Arena has this to say for those looking into getting the iOS 10.1 Beta. “Note that this is still in ‘Beta’ mode, which means there could be bugs and inconsistencies, or limited features (such as inability to record video in this mode) when using the iSight Duo camera in Portrait Mode.” “iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus dramatically improve every aspect of the iPhone experience, reaching a new level of innovation and precision to make this the best iPhone we have ever made,” Philip Schiller, the senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing for the Cupertino-based tech giant, shared via Apple Newsroom. “The completely redesigned cameras shoot incredible photos and videos day or night, the A10 Fusion chip is the most powerful chip on any smartphone while delivering the best battery life ever in an iPhone, and an entirely new stereo speaker system provides twice the sound, all within the first water and dust resistant iPhone.” [Featured Image by Sean Gallup/Getty Images] Now Read This: Samsung Galaxy S8, S8 Plus, And Galaxy Note 8 Model Numbers Leak Share 1 Tweet 0 Share 0 Share 0 Pin It 0 Author Venus Montalbo Tags: Apple, firmware update, ios 10, iPhone 7 Comments LATEST HEADLINES Michigan Police Officer Suspended After Driving With Confederate Flag Near Anti-Trump Protest [Video] Angelina Jolie Moves On After Brad Pitt Gets Cleared Of Child Abuse Charges ‘Deadliest Catch’ News: Jake Harris Beaten, In Hospital As Brother Josh Gives Updates New School Dormitory Doors Vandalized With Drawings Of Swastikas EXO And BTS Will Be At ‘MAMA 2016’ — Both Popular K-Pop Boy Bands Will Headline The ‘2016 Mnet Asian Music Awards’ Luc Besson, Director Of ‘Valerian’ And ‘Fifth Element’, Discusses Connecting The Beatles’ Song To Trailer ‘Halo’ 15th Anniversary To Be Celebrated Next Week, Developer 343 Talks Event And Teases Future ‘Halo 5’ Plans Did Kylie Jenner Slam Rob Kardashian, Blac Chyna’s New Baby?

Valve shows off new VR controller prototypes Mystery Shopper: London's West End by Sophia Murray Thursday, October 13th 2016 at 10:34AM Print this page Email Share on Twitter Share on Facebook Share on Google Share on LinkedIn Our Mystery Shopper visits London’s iconic West End, home to numerous flagship stores and attracting shoppers from all over the world, in search of a MacBook Air with a budget of £800-1,000.   Selfridges – 5/10 After seeking some guidance from a member of staff at customer services, I am directed down into the basement where all the tech items – from laptops to TVs to spy pens – are located.  Advertisement This iconic retailer is not renowned for its technology or electronics, but with a large section on the lower level and an adventurous feeling, I decide to take my chances.  Entering the department, I ask for further assistance from a security guard as to where the MacBook Airs and other Apple devices are located.  I am directed over to a Stormfront store-in-store which looks like a slightly mishapen Apple store. After that point, there is no more assistance and I am left to my own devices.  Only the top of the range MacBooks Airs are on display here. The cheapest costs £849 and is a 13-inch. I look to see if anyone is around to provide me with any assistance or advice but to no avail. With no-one around I’m left feeling underwhelmed, unimpressed and disappointed with the entire experience.   Currys PC World – 6/10 It does not take me very long to attract the attention of a very friendly shop assistant who is more than happy to offer me any help and advice. I tell the sales associate that I am looking for a MacBook Air and I have a price range of £800-1000. I am concerned then when the first thing they talk about is purchasing a beefed up iCloud storage package.  “You’ll need this package if you want to save any documents or images,’’ then the prices directly follow. Trying to get back on track, I quickly divert the conversation to the different MacBook options. The 11-inch looks good and is at the bottom end of my budget. I am keen to find out more and I’m told that it comes with 256 GB of storage at £764. That’s the most about the device as I’ll get out of the assistant who is quick thereafter to offer me a Microsoft Office 365 package. Enthusastic staff, but far too much time was spent selling subscriptions instead of the product I want.   Electronics Outlet – 6/10 Within seconds of entering the store and striking up a conversation with the shop assistant – who is determined to tell me why I shouldn’t be purchasing a MacBook – I know that this will not be the best place to buy the particular MacBook Air that I am looking for.  An 11-inch MacBook for £650 is the best the store could do. I am instead told I would be better off getting a 15.6-inch Lenovo which comes with 1TB of storage at a much cheaper price than even a refurbished MacBook.  This level of honesty is something that I would not expect to find elsewhere in the area and it is exemplary of why people have such strong faith in indies.  In contrast to a lot of major retailers, the shop assistant here is not trying to push one product in particular. I feel reassured as a customer that I will be able to walk away with the best product at a reasonable price. Even though I did not find a MacBook Air here, I am impressed by the refreshing honesty from the staff.   Argos – 7/10 Argos has drastically changed its practices and image in the past few years. I was mistaken in expecting paper catalogues, pens and smiling sales assistants. Instead, I am met by a touchscreen catalogue that shows me an array of MacBooks Airs from which I can. At the very top of my budget is a 13-inch, 256 GB MacBook Air. At the lower end is the 11.6 inch model with 128 GB of flash storage.  The range to choose from is impressive, but some of the MacBooks are ‘delivery only’. If I was planning to purchase on the spot, I would have to choose from one of the few models that are actually available in-store.  This store has done well to shake itself up in order appeal to the e-commerce shopper, employing a model closer to click-and-collect. It is no longer a standard bricks and mortar store, instead it is something that has moved with the times for customers to experience something of a hybrid between online shopping, and doing it the ‘old fashioned’ way.   Summary The West End is a vibrant consumer destination where roads like Regent Street, Oxford Street, Tottenham Court Road and Bond Street draw hundreds of thousands of shoppers every year. Perhaps it is the more tourist-centric nature of the area that made tracking down a reasonably priced MacBook Air difficult. The lack of staff interaction in Selfridges’ technology department was lacklustre, considering how bustling the store itself is. Argos had the best selection of MacBook Airs, but depended too much on touchscreen catalogues and not enough on quality customer service.  Currys PC World also had a good selection, but the staff member’s ‘sell, sell, sell’ attitude was more than enough to put me off. It was only when I arrived at the independently run Electronics Outlet that I was shown a good level of customer service – despite not even having the item I wanted in stock. Apple is a name synonymous with the high street, so I was more than a little disappointed by the lack of options in the West End when it came to MacBook Airs.

Apple Evan Selleck Contributing Editor | October 17, 2016 55 shares 47 7 0 1 0 0 0 0 0               Ahead of the announcement of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, expectations were pretty low as far as design was concerned. All of the leaks and rumors suggested that Apple would be effectively “taking a break” from any real changes when it came to the overall design of this year’s iPhone, and that it would be a similar handset to the iPhone 6s – and the iPhone 6. Apple has itself to blame for this, simply because we’re creatures of habit and the company set us up in a nice little routine. We simply didn’t just want Apple to have a bold new design for the iPhone 7, something different from last year’s handset, but we expected it, because that’s what the company has done for years now. Introduce a design, release it again with more impressive software/hardware features in the next year, and then launch a handset with a redesigned body after that (with new software and hardware tricks for good measure). Of course, it should go without saying that it’s Apple’s phone, and release cycle, so they can do whatever they want. They don’t have to stick to any patterns. But the end result was actually quite a bit different when it comes to specific parts. Yes, the iPhone 7 shares overall design similarities to the two previous iPhone generations, but it also makes some stark differences that certainly make it stand out. One of those was the new Home button that isn’t a button at all. The company brought over its haptic feedback from the Force Touch trackpad present in the 12-inch MacBook, and the newer MacBook Pro models, and implemented it in the one feature that hasn’t changed the longest. The Home button on the front of the iPhone helps give the device its familiar aesthetic. You know it’s an iPhone by looking at it. But everything changes eventually, and here we are with a sensor that looks like a button, just to keep up with the aesthetic, but isn’t a button at all. The new iPhones have been out now for a month, which means those who’ve picked up the latest Apple flagships have had time to find out if they like the new Home button-not-a-button or not. I’m genuinely curious how iPhone owners are adapting to the new design choice. Are you a fan of the new Home sensor? Or would you prefer to see Apple make a return to the actual button? Do you think this design decision is a sign of things to come in future iPhones? Let me know!

Follow TechnoBuffalo Apple knows Siri needs some serious work. It falls short compared to other search assistants available. The company certainly doesn’t want to be left behind, either, and by all accounts AI is the future of computing. Google has Google Assistant, Microsoft has Cortana, even Amazon has Alexa which works surprisingly well. Apple looks to be making an effort to fix Siri. It has been snatching up a handful of firms that are involved in the field. The company just hired Carnegie Mellon University professor Russ Salakhutdinov to lead the AI research team. Salakhutdinov made the announcement in a recent tweet. Apple isn’t done with just the one hire either. It’s  looking to hire a bunch of research scientists in the fields of “deep learning, machine learning and artificial intelligence”.

Apple Pushes Out Update To Fix Verizon Customers’ iPhone Connection Issues Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Apple Pushes Out Update To Fix Verizon Customers’ iPhone Connection Issues Image courtesy of YouTube October 17, 2016 3:02 pm EST By Ashlee Kieler@akieler where's the signal? verizon Security Update connectivity issue fixing the problem lte complaints iPhone 7 iphone apple Earlier this month, Verizon Wireless users complained that they were experiencing connection issues with the newly released iPhone 7. In an attempt to fix this issue, Apple has just released an update to the iPhone’s operating system. Apple released a security update Monday that addresses an apparent bug that causes some devices to unexpectedly drop the LTE signal and GPS, regardless of local signal strength. The update, identified as 10.0.3, is solely focused on fixing the cellular connectivity issues for the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. This means that the update will not be pushed out to older iPhones, according to The Verge. While it’s still unclear what caused the phones on Verizon’s network to experience the connectivity drop, thousands of customers described the issues in comments on Apple and Verizon forums. In many cases, customers said the outages come and go on their own, with “No Service” messages popping up often when they are running apps that use GPS such as Waze or Google Maps. “I keep having issues with my network dropping for a few minutes at a time with a Verizon iPhone 7,” customer Mike said. “This is particularly troublesome when driving in an unknown area and using Waze or Google maps for directions. The signal will just drop entirely for two to three minutes. This may happen three or four times on a 60-minute drive.” The issue also seems to be occurring in areas where customers say they previously had strong service with older iPhones. “I just completed a 200-mile trip, all interstate with 95% LTE coverage,” one person wrote on a Verizon forum. “iPhone 7+ would drop service every few minutes/miles. Other devices on iOS 9. (6s, 6+) as well as MiFi were able to maintain continuous service. Comparing coverage when service would drop showed iOS 9 maintained 3 bars, so not spotty coverage area.” Apple issues iOS update to fix iPhone 7 cellular connectivity issues [The Verge] October 17, 2016 By Ashlee Kieler@akieler where's the signal? verizon Security Update connectivity issue fixing the problem lte complaints iPhone 7 iphone apple Tell a friend: Share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window) Click to email (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Related where's the signal?

Home Industry Companies Apple Hires Carnegie Mellon AI Academic to Push Machine Learning Apple Hires Carnegie Mellon AI Academic to Push Machine Learning Apple Inc. hired a prominent artificial intelligence researcher from Carnegie Mellon University as it seeks to regain lost ground against competitors such as Google, Microsoft Corp. and Amazon.com Inc. in machine learning By: Bloomberg | Updated: October 18, 2016 2:05 AM Apple is seeking scientists with “experience in Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Optimization, and/or Data Mining,” it said in the job listing. (Reuters)  Apple Inc. hired a prominent artificial intelligence researcher from Carnegie Mellon University as it seeks to regain lost ground against competitors such as Google, Microsoft Corp. and Amazon.com Inc. in machine learning. Russ Salakhutdinov tweeted on Monday that he’s joining the Cupertino, California-based company as a director of AI research, in addition to his role at the university. He posted a link to an Apple job application page seeking machine learning specialists. Apple is seeking scientists with “experience in Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Optimization, and/or Data Mining,” it said in the job listing. The iPhone maker has been on an acquisition spree to beef up its artificial intelligence capabilities over the past 12 months, buying at least a half-dozen startups including Seattle-based Turi Inc. Apple’s penchant for secrecy has burdened efforts to improve AI offerings and hire the best talent. That’s because researchers in the field like to publish their findings, something Apple has frowned upon in the past. Machine learning has gained mounting importance for tech companies to improve their research and enable virtual assistants such as Siri to better anticipate and predict users’ needs. Siri is competing with the Google Assistant, Microsoft’s Cortana and Amazon’s Alexa to become the virtual assistant of choice and the access point for users seeking online services. Salakhutdinov joined Carnegie Mellon, a respected AI research center, earlier this year after spells at the University of Toronto and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. His research has been funded by Google, Microsoft and Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd., among others, according to his personal website at the Pittsburgh-based university. Salakhutdinov has published extensively on neural networks, a branch of AI critical for voice and image recognition technology, collaborating with top researchers from academia and Google parent Alphabet Inc.

Although Apple’s tax structure in Europe itself and the question of whether they could have recorded the profits in the countries where the sales were actually generated, are not issues covered by EU State aid rules, the Commission stated its readiness to assist Member States in their investigation into whether the commercial risks, sales and other activities of Apple should have been recorded within their jurisdictions. Having regard to all the above, and given that Greece is currently forced, owing to the prolonged economic crisis, to overtax citizens and businesses located there: 1. Has Greece or any other Member State requested a report on the Commission’s investigation with a view to calculating how much tax Apple avoided paying in its jurisdiction? 2. Does the Commission know how much in total Apple earned during the period under investigation in the profits from selling products and services in Greece that have been recorded in Apple Sales International and Apple Operations Europe in Ireland?

What is at issue here is the need to move towards a fairer, more consistent and, above all, more harmonised tax system to avoid the concentration of certain companies in low-tax countries, and therefore to rebalance tax systems at European level. What solutions could the Commission propose to move towards a harmonisation of European tax systems, or at least towards rebalancing them, in order to overcome the inequalities between Member States which could ultimately lead to economic and social difficulties?

The iPhone and Mac maker’s planned research center in Japan will play a role in those plans, and the country could be at the forefront of plans to push Apple Pay as the standard for a no-cash world. Apple has big plans for artificial intelligence Mr. Cook is currently touring Japan ahead of the December opening of Apple’s Yokohama advanced research and development center. He told the Nikkei Asian Review the facility will focus on “deep engineering.” He add that artificial intelligence, or AI, crosses all products and is used “in ways that most people don’t even think about.” Instead of making users more aware of what AI is doing for them, he sees a future where it handles tasks transparently, like remembering where your car is parked, or suggesting songs you’ll likely enjoy. The AI concept Mr. Cook described is less C-3PO or Tony Stark’s J.A.R.V.I.S. and is more behind the scenes intelligent task manager. In essence, an AI we don’t have to think about interacting with, and that is far more proactive than reactive. That doesn’t mean Apple is off the hook for improving Siri. The company’s spoken interface platform is currently seen as lagging behind Amazon’s Alexa and Microsoft’s Cortana, and no matter how good Apple’s AI is at anticipating our needs we’ll still need an effective way to interact with it. Hopefully Apple is working on an AI system that excels at anticipating our needs and interacts with us in a natural and human way. Don’t show me the money Mr. Cook also sees Apple Pay as the future of a cashless society, and Asian markets as the catalyst. The iPhone 7 is gaining support for Japan’s FeliCa contactless payment standard this month, which just the next step in moving away from cash. Mr. Cook added, We would like to be a catalyst for taking cash out of the system. We don’t think the consumer particularly likes cash. Moving away from cash does offer both convenience and security. You don’t need to remember to get cash from an ATM, and you don’t have any money to get stolen or lost. Still, moving to a truly cashless society isn’t as easy as adopting a standard. There are still a significant number of people who don’t want or can’t get a bank account, and that’s currently a necessary part of the cashless and mobile payment system. Abandoning cash will also disenfranchise homeless populations as well as the under employed and unemployed who may not have bank accounts. Without any way to pay rent or buy food, those groups will get pushed even farther into the fringes of society. Unless technology companies, banks, and governments can find a way to address the bank account issue, we’ll end up with a new caste system: those who can pay cashless, and those who can’t. That’s an interesting problem for Mr. Cook and Apple to overcome. Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn Reddit Tags: AI, Apple, Apple Pay, Japan 5 Comments Add a comment Jamie October 17, 2016 Good points. I don’t know that a cashless society is really something that would benefit everyone, either. Additionally, I really don’t care to live a curated life, they can keep their recommendations, thanks! I think it’s time we stop turning to Silicone Valley for solutions, technology is not a panacea, and none of these proposals actually address root causes, just symptoms, and as you have pointed out yourself, even on that level, issues are only being addressed for a smaller percentage of people. It’s nonsense bordering on madness. Even Apple is beginning to fail to understand the human experience at this point, something they used to do very uniquely and effectively. It’s sad to me, vision for technology is really in the toilet these days. October 17, 2016 at 12:14 EST PM geoduck October 17, 2016 A cashless society won’t happen until I can pay at the farmers market, buy something from a small artist, pay a busker, buy a box of Girl Guides cookies, or have somebody mow my lawn without cash. October 17, 2016 at 12:48 EST PM brett_x October 17, 2016 Many of our local farmers’ markets here in Maine even accept the EBT cards that are used for food stamps / other assistance (welfare) these days. I’m guessing many of those people do not have bank accounts. So I think this indicates that we’re not that far off. A cashless society won’t happen until I can pay at the farmers market … Geoduck, my wife and I vacationed in Nova Scotia this summer and rarely had to dig for cash, even at the farmers’ markets and small vendors. So even Canada isn’t that far off. (Admittedly, they’ve been way ahead of the game with the chip cards anyway.) October 17, 2016 at 2:16 EST PM Lee Dronick October 18, 2016 A cashless society? Well that would be gold mine for data miners. Not mention what would happen should the system go down. October 18, 2016 at 3:43 EST PM Scott B in DC October 19, 2016 @geoduck is right. Although I use a card reader for my collectibles business, when I go to shows over 90-percent of my customers pay cash. I can make $500-600 a day and carry home almost all of it in cash. Studies have shown that 33-38 percent (depending on the study) of all transactions in the United States are made using credit or debit cards. I have never seen a study that claims over 40-percent were non-cash transactions including the studies made by the Payment Card Industry. In the view of the people with first-world problems, I see their point. For those of us who deal with the masses, cash is king!

Citing unnamed sources, the report said that Apple has reassigned employees and is focusing solely on developing an autonomous software system. Furthermore, the company’s executive team has imposed a deadline of the end of 2017 to determine the viability of that system. But, Apple Car isn’t necessarily dead. Bob Mansfield I’ve made this point many times when writing about Apple Car, but it bears repeating: Bob Mansfield is a bad-ass. His task, as we understand it, was to figure out what to do with Project Titan—Apple’s codename for its car. He’s known for pulling the plug on projects that need to die. The fact that he hasn’t says just as much as the changes he has wrought. You’ll see headlines saying that Apple Car is dead, but pay little heed to them. I’m not saying it’s not dead, I’m saying that its moot. The team has until the end of next year to figure out if its autonomous software works. If it does, that’s when Apple will decide what to do with it. According to Bloomberg, options include partnering with automakers and revisiting the idea of Apple making its own car. Consider it Schrödinger’s Car. Right now, Apple Car is both alive and dead, and only when viewed at some specific point in the future will we know which. Team An interesting tidbit from Bloomberg’s report is that the Project Titan team has remained consistent at around 1,000 people. Considering that aspects of the project have been terminated, some employees have been reassigned, and still more left Apple entirely, it means Apple has continued to hire even while scaling back. That means Apple remains commited to playing a larger role in the auto industry. Apple may still ditch that role, and it may or may not end up making its own car, but Project Titan continues as of now. Best Guess for Apple Car All that said, I would now be surprised if Apple ended up making its own automobile. I was confident Apple was working on its own car when this story first broke in February of 2015. And it turned out Apple was doing just that. But things change. While Apple could come back to the idea of making its own car, it now seems a lot more likely the company will eventually partner with one or more automakers. And the thing is, that will still be cool. An Apple-designed autonomous vehicle software system could still improve the driving experience, and having a better driving experience was always what excited me about Apple Car. Jeff Gamet, John Martellaro, and I discussed this topic on Monday’s Daily Observations. Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn Reddit Add a Comment Click here to cancel reply.

He will continue to teach at Carnegie Mellon, but will also serve as "Director of AI Research" at Apple. In his tweet, Salakhutdinov says he is seeking additional research scientists with machine learning expertise to join his team. An included job posting asks that candidates have experience with Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Optimization, and/or Data Mining. Salakhutdinov specializes in statistical machine learning and has authored many papers on neural networks, deep kernel learning, reinforcement learning, and other related topics. His expertise may be used to improve services like Siri, which has been in the spotlight recently after journalist Walt Mossberg wrote a piece calling the personal assistant "limited," "unreliable," and "dumb." Siri is powered by a neural network and uses machine learning techniques to improve over time, as do other Apple features like Spotlight, QuickType, Photos, autocorrect, Maps, and more. Salakhutdinov's hiring comes as rumors suggest Apple is aiming to improve Siri as part of an effort to build the personal assistant into an Amazon Echo-like smart home product that would be able to do things like control smart home accessories. Apple is also on the verge of finishing an R&D research center in Yokohama, Japan, which will focus on "deep engineering" and developing Apple's artificial intelligence services.

Rating: 9 Votes macduke 4 weeks ago Siri was cool in 2011, but is currently where I expected it to be in 2013. They haven't kept up with the rest of the industry. Why? Secrecy. The culture for all of these researchers is collaborative, open source work where they share results and help each other iterate and build better software. I read somewhere that Google's people are regularly contributing to the community of research around AI, machine learning, neural networks—whatever it may be. Secrecy is a big deal with Apple, but the type of people who are passionate about this aren't interested in working at places like that. They don't thrive in a vacuum isolated from their peers.

Apple is now pushing iOS 10.0.3 to the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. If you’ve got a different iPhone model, this update doesn’t apply to you. According to Apple, this update “fixes bugs including an issue where some users could temporarily lose cellular connectivity.” To update, go into Settings > General > Software Update on your iPhone. Following the launch of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus last month, some Verizon customers began having issues with their new phones that’d result in a loss of LTE connectivity. iPhone 7 owners on other carriers later determined that they were being affected by the bug, too. With today’s update, those cellular connectivity problems should be taken care of. Apple is also prepping an iOS 10.1 update. Beta versions of iOS 10.1 have been going out to testers in recent weeks, but it’s unclear when that update will be released to the public.

October 17 AAPL: 117.55 -0.08 Apple bolstering Siri intelligence by hiring expert to lead AI research team Edoardo Maggio - 4 weeks ago @northead Apple AI Machine learning View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit One of the areas where Apple has seemingly fallen behind its competition — or, more likely, not yet ready to disclose its technology’s full potential — is artificial intelligence. However, there’s no denying that the company is pushing hard towards bettering its existing products (like Siri) behind closed doors, and the latest AI hire is but another proof of such commitment… The Cupertino firm has just hired Carnegie Mellon University professor Russ Salakhutdinov, who will lead an “AI research” team as director. To announce the news was none other than Salakhutdinov himself, who took to Twitter to express his excitement. He also took advantage of the platform to post a job listing link, asking for people interested in joining his team to head over to Apple’s website and apply. It is not yet clear, but chances are that Salakhutdinov’s team will work closely with the recently-set up Turi division, and by extension other teams behind Siri and various core services. In the recent months, Apple — in its typical “occasional purchase” fashion — also gobbled up Tuplejump, Perceptio, VocalIQ, Mapsense, Emotient, Coherent Navigation and Semetric, just to name a few, to remain at the forefront of AI, machine learning and other similar, relatively new-wave technologies CEO Tim Cook deems to be part of “an incredible future”. However, it remains to be seen whether their continuous push towards privacy will prove not to be too much of an impediment in the years to come, as well as the secrecy the company is known — and, at times, criticized — for, despite the more open (and indeed more welcomed) approach as of this year. Excited about joining Apple as a director of AI research in addition to my work at CMU.

However, 9to5Mac now reports that Apple has several implementations in place to prevent this from happening. As many know, Apple has been using special OS images for its devices for quite some time now. For example, users can’t set a passcode on iOS devices and then lock it, Macs also revert back to their original state after a reboot. The images on the devices are regularly updated as well. For example, users aren’t capable of setting the Home page in Safari, or be able to move or delete apps on demo devices. One specific security feature in the special OS images is that both iOS and Mac devices are rendered useless if they are removed from the store. Citing sources familiar with the matter, Apple has a ‘kill switch’ in Software that disables the devices once they get out of range of the store Wi-Fi. This means that Apple doesn’t need to use Find My iPhone to disable these devices. While devices used for workshops have a different image on them, they still have the kill-switch to prevent them from theft. A former Apple Store employee said that special OS images were on Macs before iOS devices. Nothing that users would take dozens of photos throughout the day and they had to delete them all manually every night. People would take photos with the demo iPhones, and we had to manually delete them all at the end of the night!

Certain countries, however, do not and the only way to search for them is to fly the country in person to do a search. Jamaica is one of these countries that don’t post their trademark registrations online. For Apple, they do their trademarks in those countries first, wait six months and then apply in the U.S. (via Quartz). As per typical Apple, the company uses shell companies to file its Jamaican applications, so that nothing is listed under its own name. While most big tech companies do this, Apple does it more often than most, according to former USPTO trademark examiner Roberto Ledesma. Some companies avail themselves of section 44(d) more than others. Apple, for example, has lodged more than three times as many foreign trademark filings as Google, the next in the ranking. A legal expert says the reason why only big companies do this is because doing so is not cheap. “I haven’t seen this technique applied in a really pervasive way—I think it’s quite an obscure approach,” says Madhani of Alt Legal. “It’s generally going to be used by companies with real legal resources … and the willingness to spend to protect something for six months.” While going this route isn’t fool proof, it does give Apple some security from its competitors. Regardless, Apple has the financial and legal resources to push through as it would be a “we can’t always win” situation.

CEO Tim Cook told the Nikkei Asian Review that the firm believes consumers want to live in a cashless society and will use Apple Pay to make it happen. Cook made these comments just a month after the iPhone 7 became the first iPhone to support FeliCa, the contactless payment standard used in Japan.  Scroll down for video  CEO Tim Cook told the Nikkei Asian Review that the firm believes consumers want to live in a cashless society and will use Apple Pay to make it happen. Cook made these comments just a month after the iPhone 7 became the first iPhone to support FeliCa in Japan HOW APPLE PAY WORKS  Apple Pay works by holding the phone up to a card reader and pressing a finger on the TouchID button. This confirms the person's identity, and the payment is made as if the user had presented and signed their card. All details are encrypted and the system stores payment information securely. If an iPhone is lost, users can suspend all payments via the Find my iPhone service. 'We would like to be a catalyst for taking cash out of the system,' Cook told Waichi Sekiguchi with Nikkei. 'We don't think the consumer particularly likes cash.' Apple Pay is a mobile and digital wallet service that lets users with certain Apple devices, such as iPhones and Apple Watches, make contactless payments. Investment in contactless debit and credit card payment technology has already paved the way for Apple Pay, as much of the necessary infrastructure is already in place.  Apple Pay was first released to US iPhone owners in 2014 and it hit the UK market just last year.

Share this article Share 42 shares Once a card is connected and verified, the phone's NFC chip can be used on contactless card readers in certain stores, restaurant, for public transportation and even at Walt Disney World.  Experts have also revealed that Apple Pay is as safe as using a chip and pin card - if not safer, as it is harder to fake a fingerprint than guess a PIN code.  Apple Pay was first released to US iOS owners in 2014 and it hit the UK market just last year 'We would like to be a catalyst for taking cash out of the system,' Cook told Waichi Sekiguchi with Nikkei. 'We don't think the consumer particularly likes cash' HOW TO SET UP APPLE PAY   To use Apple Pay, iPhone owners need to update to the latest iOS software. This is accessed in the Settings menu, under General and Software Update.  To update, make sure the phone is connected to Wi-Fi, plugged into the mains and all data on it has been backed up.  Apple Pay is a mobile and digital wallet service that lets users with certain Apple devices, such as iPhones and Apple Watches, make contactless payments. Experts have also revealed that Apple Pay is as safe as using a chip and pin card Once updated, go to the Passbook app and the option to set up Apple Pay should appear at the top.  Click 'Add Credit or Debit Card'.  Users can then manually enter their credit or debit card details, or take a photo of the front of the card using the phone's camera.  Once a card is connected, the phone's NFC chip can be used on contactless card readers in stores, in tube stations and on buses where available.  It works in the same way as a contactless card and the money is deducted from the connected account automatically.  The service is compatible with the iPhone 6, 6 Plus, iPhone 6S, 6S Plus, 7, 7 Plus, iPhone SE, iPad Air 2, iPad Pro and the Apple Watch. Users with iPhone 5, 5C, 5S, 6, 6 Plus, 6S, 6S Plus, 7, 7 Plus and iPhone SE can use the service through an Apple Watch, though it lacks Touch ID security.   Your card details are not stored on your phone, watch or iPad, so if a thief gets hold of one of them they cannot access your bank account.  Instead, your bank, MasterCard, Visa and Apple create a unique, encrypted code that is sent to your phone. There will also be no record of your card details on Apple's databases, so if the company computers are hacked, your money is not at risk. The technology is also clever enough to spot if you are making an unusual or large transaction.  Apple Pay is only accepted at certain stores, restaurant, such as Starbucks (pictured) and even at Walt Disney World. Cook also revealed that Apple is working on more advanced AI that can improve your phones' battery life, recommend music and help you find parked your car During the same interview with Nikkei, Cook touched on more technology Apple foresees in the near future that can improve our lives - artificial intelligence (AI). Cook said Apple has plans to open a research and development center in Yokohama, Japan to work on'deep learning' technologies. However, the CEO declined to tell Nikkei any specifics or details of the work. He did note that the firm wants to use AI to give improve your phones battery life, recommend music and 'help you remember where you parked your car'.    Read more: Interview: Tim Cook says Apple¿s aim is a cashless society; working to boost the role of AI | 9to5Mac Interview: Apple CEO says iPhone's future is in AI- Nikkei Asian Review Share or comment on this article e-mail 42 shares Most watched News videos SNL mocks confident Clinton supporters with Dave Chappelle Havelock resident shocked as he films earthquake hitting NZ Trump supporter spews ignorant racist rant at young woman Adorable boxer dog jumps far better than the John Lewis dog Mother kicks her young child out for voting Trump in school Michael Moore tries to meet with Trump at Trump Tower Clinton makes final appearance at campaign headquarters Nigel Farage avoids questions as he enters Trump Tower Dashcam footage captures moment van swerves before crashing SNL mocks government shutdown with Gravity skit Terryfing video of ground shaking as earthquake hits Christchurch Malcolm Turnbull accuses Lisa Wilkinson of 'interrogating' him Trump says he will 'immediately' deport two to three million...

Russ Salakhutdinov tweeted on Monday that he’s joining the Cupertino, California-based company as a director of AI research, in addition to his role at the university. He posted a link to an Apple job application page seeking machine learning specialists. Apple is seeking scientists with “experience in Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Optimization, and/or Data Mining,” it said in the job listing.

Apple’s penchant for secrecy has burdened efforts to improve AI offerings and hire the best talent. That’s because researchers in the field like to publish their findings, something Apple has frowned upon in the past. Machine learning has gained mounting importance for tech companies to improve their research and enable virtual assistants such as Siri to better anticipate and predict users’ needs. Siri is competing with the Google Assistant, Microsoft’s Cortana and Amazon’s Alexa to become the virtual assistant of choice and the access point for users seeking online services. Salakhutdinov joined Carnegie Mellon, a respected AI research center, earlier this year after spells at the University of Toronto and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. His research has been funded by Google, Microsoft and Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd., among others, according to his personal website at the Pittsburgh-based university. Salakhutdinov has published extensively on neural networks, a branch of AI critical for voice and image recognition technology, collaborating with top researchers from academia and Google parent Alphabet Inc.

Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple, has told Asia’s Nikkei news agency that consumers aren’t too keen on physical currency, and that they'd much rather use cashless services such as Apple Pay. “We'd like to be a catalyst for taking cash out of the system,” Cook was quoted as saying. “We don’t think the consumer particularly likes cash." His comments came as Apple prepares to launch Apple Pay in Japan this month. At the time of the announcement, Cook said: “We're incredibly excited to bring iPhone 7 to customers in Japan so they can experience the magic of Apple Pay. Apple Pay will transform your daily routine, from making your commute easier and more convenient than ever with Suica [a contactless smart card used to pay train fares in Japan] right on your iPhone 7 and Apple Watch Series 2, to using your favourite cards to make secure and private purchases with a single touch." Apple's CEO Tim Cook speaks out against physical currency Apple Pay launched on 20 October 2014, arriving as one of the first modern, smartphone-based contactless payment systems. It’s currently supported by most recent Apple smartphones, as well as the Apple Watch and several versions of the iPad. It makes use of a built-in near-field communication (NFC) antenna, as well as a dedicated chip that stores encrypted payment information. But Apple isn’t the only company offering cashless solutions. Google launched its own Android Pay mobile payments platform in the UK earlier this year, while Brits are still waiting around for Blighty's Samsung Pay debut.

Ming-Chi Kuo, a respected Apple analyst at KGI Securities, believes that between 5 million and 7 million lost Note 7 orders will become iPhone 7 sales instead. And the majority of these new orders will go to the iPhone 7 Plus thanks to its unique dual-camera configuration, apparently. That’s according to an investor note penned by Kuo and revealed by 9to5mac. Today's report notes: “KGI says Note 7 users will have lost faith in the Samsung brand and have a tendency to like iOS and camera features, making the new iPhone an attractive sale.” Kuo says that Apple will snag around 50% of the ex-Note 7 customers (estimated to number around 12 million in total), while the rest will be shared out among prominent Android manufacturers such as Huawei. It’s also expected that a number of Note 7 customers will jump ship to Google’s new smartphones – particularly the Google Pixel XL, which is the larger of the two models the search giant is releasing. Could Disenfranchised Note 7 owners flock to Apple's iPhone 7 Plus? Samsung announced the Galaxy Note 7 on 2 August, with the handset arriving to critical acclaim from reviewers who praised the impressive hardware, software and design. But exactly one month later, Samsung issued a global recall for the new phone after an internal investigation uncovered a serious battery flaw that was causing some users’ handsets to spontaneously catch fire. Samsung is still trying to deal with the fiery Note 7 fiasco, with engineers reportedly struggling to pinpoint why even "fixed" handsets appear to be catching fire. As a result of the latest fires, Samsung has vowed to stop manufacturing and selling the handset, and is urging all Note 7 customers to turn off their phones indefinitely.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Video: New Ad Promotes BeatsX Wireless Headphones & More | Main | Apple Granted 47 Patents Covering Apple Store Fixtures and More the Day after Fortune Interviews Angela Ahrendts » October 17, 2016 Class Action Brought by Apple Store Specialists against Apple Begins Tomorrow   In 2013 Patently Apple posted a report titled "Apple Store Employee Files Class Action Lawsuit over Lost Wages." The report covered a full-time non-exempt Apple Store Specialist who worked at both Spokane and San Francisco stores over a two year period has filed a Class Action lawsuit against Apple on behalf of himself and all non-exempt employees who are employed by Apple as non-exempt Specialists, Lead Specialists and Expert Specialists and non-exempt Managers, Senior Managers, Developmental Managers and Business Managers. Specialists and Managers are collectively referred to as Hourly Employees. The nuts and bolts of the complaint revolved around the fact that employees that are paid hourly wages should be compensated for the time lost waiting in lines for mandatory Apple security checks every day. Considering this is a requirement by Apple, employees should be compensated. Apple was sued in a similar case in July by two former Apple Store employees from New York and Los Angeles. Our report covers the full basic complaint filed with the court in San Francisco." The case finally begins tomorrow in San Diego's Superior Court.   About Comments: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit comments.

(NASDAQ: AAPL) should begin selling a monthly subscription model. According to Manjoo, it's "hard to see" what exactly Apple can introduce to the market that already doesn't exist from the likes of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX). He added that any content that is exclusively available on Apple's device is "an odd thing." Related Link: Apple Prime? Goldman Sachs Says Apple Has A $19 Billion Bundle Package On Its Hands "It's unusual in our media world to have a TV show that only works on an Apple device - or a certain kind of device," he said. "Even exclusive subscriptions like Netflix and Amazon work on pretty much all devices, so it would be an unusual media deal." Manjoo also pointed out that Apple's executives have touted its Services segment as being its fastest growing part of its overall business while also pulling in a profit. However, as Apple may be tempted to push further into the Services segment with streaming video, it comes at a time when there is a lot of competition and it's "hard to see what it is they can do that is better." Bottom line, Apple has proven it isn't "best of breed" in other Services sectors such as cloud and Siri so they "have to get much better than they are right now."

 If you have an iPhone 7 on Verizon, you need the latest software update Kif Leswing Oct. 17, 2016, 1:41 PM 3,188 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple If your Verizon iPhone 7 seems to be stuck on 3G, it's not your fault — it's an Apple software issue. Apple rolled out a new version of iOS, 10.0.3, on Monday, to fix it.  Since the iPhone 7 first came out last month, Verizon customers have complained that their phones seemed to be stuck getting slow internet from their network. Instead of LTE speeds, users complained they were only getting 3G speed. According to forum posters, representatives have said it's a "known issue," and it even effects GPS accuracy. Apple has finally addressed the issue, with a patch that "fixes bugs, including an issue where some users could temporarily lose cellular connectivity." One Apple employee tweeted that yes, the update should solve Verizon LTE connectivity issues.  So if you've got an iPhone on the Verizon network, you should update your device now. To do so, head to Settings > General > Software Update.  EXCLUSIVE FREE REPORT: 25 Big Tech Predictions by BI Intelligence.

Post-Explosion Drama: 1 in 2 Samsung Galaxy Note 7 Owners to Switch to iPhone 7 GO Top Apple analyst believes Apple will score big with the iPhone 7 thanks to Samsung’s Galaxy Note 7 fiasco Oct 17, 2016 17:42 GMT  ·  By Bogdan Popa  ·  Share:  Samsung has already given up on the Note 7 series, but the fiasco isn’t over just yet, as the firm is still struggling to recover and reduce the damages that its explosive phone has created. One of the priorities for the South Korean company right now is to convince Note 7 owners to stick with its devices, and although Samsung executives previously bragged with a very loyal userbase, a top Apple analyst believes that the iPhone 7 lineup is going to score big thanks to Samsung’s drama. KGI analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said in a note to investors that approximately 50 percent of those who ordered a Note 7 are now very likely to go for an iPhone 7, as customer trust is collapsing in the Samsung ecosystem and all these buyers are no longer planning to stick with phones manufactured by the South Korean firm. Between 5 to 7 million Note 7 orders are likely to transfer to Apple, the analyst says, and the iPhone 7 Plus is expected to be the main model benefitting from this transition. Google, Huawei to also experience boost in sales Other Android phone manufacturers, including Huawei, are also likely to benefit from Samsung’s fiasco, and Google itself could also record an increase in Pixel sales following the Note 7 demise. But Apple will certainly take the lion’s share here, mostly thanks to the iPhone 7 Plus currently being positioned as a direct rival to the Note 7. A study that was conducted recently by Branding Brand revealed that 40 percent of Samsung customers who ordered a Note 7 are ready to jump ship to a different manufacturer, with 30 percent of respondents explaining that the iPhone is very likely to be their next destination. Only 8 percent of them picked the Google Pixel, but what’s good for the ecosystem is that 62 percent of the users said they wanted to stick with Android. Samsung itself expects the worst to happen, even though the company has already boosted S7 Edge production in anticipation of growing demand from Note 7 owners. The firm estimated a loss of $3 billion in operating profit for the last quarter of this year, as it struggles to recall defective phones. #Apple#iPhone 7#Samsung#Note 7 explosion#Note 7 subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Apple Has a Backup Solution If the iPhone 7 Home Button Breaks Down Apple to Officially Kill Off the iPhone 4 on October 31 Apple Seeds Third Developer Beta of watchOS 3.1 Apple Watch Operating System iOS Far Behind Android Despite Strong iPhone SE Sales Five Great Calendar Apps for Android HP Elite X3 with Windows 10 Mobile: The PC Experience Motorola DROID Turbo 3 with 16MP Hasselblad Camera Leaks in Press Renders New Photo of the x86 Windows 10 Mobile Phone Gets Leaked Nikon Updates Firmware for Its COOLPIX A300 Camera - Get Version 1.2 Microsoft Releases Interactive Mail Notifications for All Windows 10 Users KDE Neon Users Urged to Upgrade Their Systems or Reinstall the Linux Distro Budgie 11 Desktop Environment to Feature a Dock Mode for the Panel, Richer UI - Exclusive    Tim Cook can only be pleased with such news new ios apps NeuroNation: Train your brain to improve your memory and focus with NeuroNation Flipagram: Create cool videos by mixing up your photos with music Timer+: Set up dozens of timers and control them all with ease Nutshell Camera: Create some pretty cool videos with Nutshell Camera IKEA Catalogue: Check out the IKEA Catalogue for more than just furniture Complete: Complete puts a social twist to your regular to-do list/ task manager WebMD Baby: WebMD Baby offers help in how to best tend to your baby Reader comments Load old comments   iPhone 8 to Launch with Curved 5.0-Inch and 5.8-Inch Displays and No Bezels more on: Apple i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

With multiple rounds of recall, confusing emails from the company and few ways to get face-to-face with a Samsung employee, Note 7 customers have to rely on often haphazard responses from the Korean electronic giant's competitors, carriers and retailers. Before an official expanded recall was announced last Thursday, CNBC saw the customers turned away from the company's fancy showroom in New York City, told to get a box and shipping label and call Samsung or go online. While many were able to navigate the process, numerous customers at carrier retail locations reported inconsistent upgrade fees, taxes or restocking fees on online forums or social media. Tweet: @verizon I just walked into vzw store trying to return my Note7 and the rep wanted to charge me a restocking fee. Really? #Verizon #Samsung Mail carriers also announced their own special guidelines for returning the phone, while Amazon issued special packaging to customers. Justin Chin | Bloomberg | Getty Images An employee, left, assists a customer as he looks at smartphone cases inside a Samsung Partnership retail store in Hong Kong. The process seemed to further aggravate some Samsung customers, many of whom were returning their Note 7 for the second time in a matter of weeks. At Best Buy, a customer told Money Magazine that the "ill-equipped" employees there caused him to lose trust in Samsung. After carriers had already begun pulling the phone from shelves, Samsung announced an expanded official recall last Thursday, offering $100 bill credits to customers that exchanged for another Samsung phone, and a $25 bill credit for customers that asked for a refund. It also offered thermally insulated boxes so customers could safely return their phones, recalled amid reports of batteries overheating and catching fire. But the announcement followed a dramatic and confusing few weeks for customers, who had already begun dealing with third parties. "I'm not saying that third parties are not going to do their best, but if you walk into an AT&T store, you have Samsung devices, Apple devices and other devices, the full lineup," said Andres Mendoza-Pena, a partner in the retail practice of at A.T. Kearney, a global strategy and management consulting firm. "For a mobile operator, assuring that a customer is satisfied with the mobile service is the first objective. Their secondary objective is their satisfaction for the device." Despite the complaints, all four major U.S. carriers — Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile and Sprint — told CNBC that customers would be able to exchange their phones without fees. Sprint and T-Mobile quickly responded to online complaints, saying consumers would also be able to keep their upgrade eligibility and be refunded the difference for lower-end phones. Though Samsung's approach is no different than most phone manufacturers, Samsung phones are more expensive and naturally draw comparisons to the "premium" treatment that Apple's customers get. The mobile manufacturer's recent recall highlights the advantages Apple reaps by investing in branded retail locations. "Whatever works best, that's what they're doing." -David Marcotte, Senior vice president of retail insights at Kantar Retail. "If I were Samsung, I would want to be on bended knee, in whatever form that took," said Kit Yarrow, consumer psychologist and author of "Decoding the New Consumer Mind." "In some ways, they do have more limited opportunity to do that by virtue of the fact of nonbranded retailers to assist in that process." The more sophisticated a product is, the more relevant it will be for a manufacturer to manage the relationship with the end consumer, Mendoza-Pena said. Indeed, 75 percent of consumers shopping for electronics prefer to test the product in person during the shopping process, Mendoza-Pena said. For instance, Xiaomi, once thought to be China's Apple-killer, was upstaged by vendors like Oppo and Vivo offering physical locations. When Apple first proposed the stores, it was to control an end-to-end experience for customers, writes Steve Jobs' biographer Walter Isaacson. The idea faced criticism, but today, the stores have the highest sale per square foot out of more than 200 retailers, according to eMarketer data. The success or failure of Samsung's recall, meanwhile, is likely to be comingled with the experiences consumers have in retail locations, Yarrow said. "If they're having a really positive experience — being offered compensation, feeling seen, heard and taken care of — it could be positive for everybody," Yarrow said. "Even Samsung can recover a little bit of stature by truly taking care of people. But if it is a bad experience, everybody involved takes a hit." There are plenty of good reasons for Samsung to forgo stores, said David Marcotte, senior vice president of retail insights at Kantar Retail. "Samsung has experimented with doing stores — their product portfolio doesn't lend itself to a store layout the same way that Apple does," Marcotte said. "Apple has an extremely limited number of products they sell. Samsung has a huge portfolio of home goods and other consumer electronics." Marcotte said it's an apples-to-oranges comparison between the two companies, because Apple has a strong emotional connection associated with its brand that hasn't been well-replicated by store brands like Microsoft. Plus, said Mendoza-Pena, the basic argument goes that companies should focus on their core competencies, and for a manufacturer like Samsung, that's not retail. "If you think about the opportunity to leverage and establish a network of stores with a third party, that allows you to have massive reach, without the same level of cost," Mendoza-Pena said. By vigorously investing in quality packaging, refunds and cooperation with retailers, Samsung is letting retailers run the well-oiled machine they know best, Marcotte added. "As bad as the situation is, I cant fault [Samsung] for anything they're doing at the moment," Marcotte said. "Whatever works best, that's what they're doing." — Reporting by CNBC's Courtney Reagan Anita BalakrishnanNews Associate Related Securities Symbol Price   Change %Change 593 --- SHOW COMMENTS Please add a username to view or add comments Public Username for Commenting JOIN THE DISCUSSION To learn more about how we use your information, please read our Privacy Policy and Terms of Service.

Bloomberg first reported on this back in July and now is corroborating the story along with some new details. According to the news agency, hundreds of members of Apple's 1,000-strong car team have been "reassigned, let go, or have left of their own volition" in recent months, and company executives have reportedly issued a deadline of late 2017 to decide whether it is worth pursuing further or if the project is canned altogether. The deadline comes after months of strategy disagreements, changes in leadership and supply chain challenges. The report quotes an unnamed source saying that Project Titan was "an incredible failure of leadership" until Bob Mansfield came over to lead the team. Bob Mansfield reportedly had three teams under his command — a software team, a hardware team, and a sensors team. John Wright, who was leading software efforts is now reportedly gone, while Dan Dodge, the creator of BlackBerry's QNX car platform, assumed a bigger role in developing Apple's platform architecture. Several hundred hardware engineers working on car chassis, suspensions, and undercarriages also left due to the shift in focus. Car makers and several tech firms are racing to develop autonomous driving technologies, which are widely expected to shape the future of private and public transportation. Google has been working on autonomous cars for years, traditional car companies are either pursuing similar projects on their own or by tying up with a tech firm, and even ride hailing companies like Uber and Lyft have plans for an autonomous car in the next 5 to 10 years.

Reports from Bloomberg suggest that the company has restructured its driverless cars division, cutting hundreds of jobs in the process. Departing members of Apple’s car team have either been reassigned or let go. While the moves aren’t public, the company’s initiatives have reportedly shifted from building a car from the inside out to building the software that powers a driverless car. This way, Apple will likely have more opportunity to partner with existing car companies. Bloomberg attributes the change in direction to new leadership, which has led to several hires which represent the department’s new direction. In addition, Apple has given the car team a deadline of late next year to prove the “feasibility of the self-driving system,” reports Bloomberg. Project Titan, the codename for Apple’s autonomous vehicle initiative, continues to evolve and shrink as Bloomberg estimates that it no longer plans to develop a electric car to compete with companies such as Tesla. Apple is not the first tech company to set its sights on partnering with members of the auto sector. Google-parent-company Alphabet and ride-hailing company Uber have taken similar paths to building out their own driverless car ambitions. Apple launched Project Titan in September of 2014, according to reports. It’s important to note that Apple has yet to acknowledge that it’s running a secret car project. While the Cupertino tech company entered the space with high hopes and lofty ambitions, it seems they may have bitten off more than they can chew. SourceBloomberg ViaThe Verge The Iceman Cometh Makes perfect sense. I think most were quite skeptical of their ability to become an auto manufacturer with all the inherent risks that comes with an already crowded market. John W Agreed 100% Can’t Fix Stupid Apple removed the headphone jack already this year, how much more innovation do people expect one company to do? St. Misery I know right? How brave can one company be? Can’t Fix Stupid Courage reimagined…. FlamesFan89 Apple has given the car team a deadline of late next year to prove the “feasibility of the self-driving system” while I get that it is directed specifically at their own team’s ability to make a driverless car, I think the feasibility of a self driving system has been thoroughly proven at this point by Tesla. They need to move past the feasibility stage and get to work on the actual product development. Can’t Fix Stupid Throw this on the pile just like the much anticipated Apple TV set. Tim Cook: “Naw, let’s just find something that we already have in the existing parts bin and call it a “Pro” and increase the price. Sure fire hit.” Smanny The thing is Google has already partnered up with Chrysler and we should see a few cars/minivans hitting the road fairly soon. The same is true for Ford as well. Uber has been looking to partner with a number of car manufacturers as well. So Apple is not only late, but they are trying to compete with a number of others. It’s kind of funny that you guys are showing a Google car for this article. Mo Dabbas Elon Musk must be laughing hard at this turnout from Apple. But I agree with the rest of the comments. I don’t see Apple able to compete against those who’s been doing cars for 50 and 100 years. Just stick with what you’re good at apple and make it better. Can’t Fix Stupid Milking the same iPhone design for 3 successive years? BetelgeuseOrion to be honest i think apple does worse than everyone else. their devices and software are so limited in functionality that it should be much easier to test and make bug proof but they still ship with ridiculous bugs and hardware issues. they have the exact same problems as every other manufacture such as batteries catching on fire in their macbooks, defective video cards which resulted in a class action lawsuit, problems with over heating and throttling. St. Misery Good idea, stick to what you do best. Leave the car making to the car makers. Sweet Ever since Tim Cook became CEO, Apple’s software quality has plummeted. It’s a big reason why I left iOS, it’s why I’ll be leaving MacOS shortly, and why I will not be going back. Even Apple fans are complaining about it. Thus I’m very pessimistic about any car software this project will produce. Instead of getting into car software, Apple should be getting out of software all together and get somebody else to write their software for them. BetelgeuseOrion so you mean.. go under haha apple doesn’t do hw at all, they may pick and choose which hw bits go where but they dont do manufacturing or the R&D behind it. apple literally has not manufactured HW since the apple II days. Raj Singh Apple and software? This’ll be interesting.

Apple has changed its plans after Bob Mansfield took the lead role back in July, (via Bloomberg). Since the project started, hundreds of employees have been re-assigned or let go with the remaining bunch working on the self-driving autonomous car platform. Apple executives have apparently set a late 2017 deadline to decide if the project is worth going through or not. Originally, Project Titan was set out to develop an electric car from the ground up, with a release date of 2020. Since then, the company has laid off dozens of employee and has rebooted the project. Apple reportedly ran into issues with the car manufacturing process. The company could not secure agreements with suppliers like they could with its iPhone line. The report says Apple execs imagined creating a car that could recognize the driver based on their biometric fingerprint. It even considered designs without a steering wheel or pedals, making the car be fully autonomous. Tags: Apple Car, Project Titan About Peter Cao Peter has a passion for music and technology.

A civil jury trial is scheduled to begin Tuesday at 9:00 a.m. local time in a courtroom presided over by the Honorable Eddie C. Sturgeon, nearly two years after Apple's appeal and motion for dismissal was denied in the case. The lawsuit, titled Felczer vs. Apple Inc., falls under the court's Department 67. The lawsuit, originally filed in 2011 and elevated to class action status in 2014, accuses Apple of failing to provide timely meal and rest breaks, failing to pay all wages due upon ending employment within the required time, and failing to provide accurate wage statements, according to court documents filed electronically. The proposed class would involve all current, former, or prospective employees in California who have worked for Apple between December 16, 2007 and the time of trial, which totaled approximately 18,000 employees as of 2014. Any settlement awarded would be divided evenly between class members. California Labor Code dictates that employees must be provided with at least a 30-minute meal break when the work period is more than five hours, and at least a 10-minute rest break for every four hours worked. The defendants claim Apple failed to always provide these breaks for at least four years prior to the lawsuit. Meanwhile, the complaint notes Apple took several weeks to send out a final paycheck to multiple employees. As a result of these unlawful business practices, the lawsuit asks for compensatory damages and repayment of all wages owed, along with interest and legal fees, but it does not specify a damages amount. Tags: lawsuit, Apple retail [ 78 comments ] Top Rated Comments (View all) gavroche 4 weeks ago I had expected better from Apple. So i presume you have already tried and found them guilty? Having been sued does not mean you are guilty (yet). I had a friend that owned a business that was brought before the labor board multiple times by disgruntled employees. Not only did he win every time after he presented his evidence, but the judge on one occasion told an employee that was saying they were not paid overtime correctly that they were in fact OVERPAID.. Lets not rush to judgement until all facts are presented. Rating: 13 Votes britboyj 4 weeks ago I worked for Apple retail for 3 years and corporate for 2, from 2008 to 2013. Breaks were mandated HARD. Like, you got written up if you didn't take them. 30 minutes if you went over 5 hours, a 15 if you were under. I wouldn't be surprised if the violations here are rogue managers. Rating: 10 Votes mi7chy 4 weeks ago Bunch of apologists. Every worker deserves their legally allowed lunch and break time including slaborers in China. With all the cash Apple has hidden away they can afford this. Rating: 9 Votes citysnaps 4 weeks ago Nice. People finding Apple guilty before the trial even begins. Shocker... Rating: 8 Votes aitachi 4 weeks ago Former Apple retail employee here. I did two stints with Apple at two different stores in two different cities in two different positions. My experience was the exact opposite of what this suits claim. Managers and Store Leaders not only required us to take our breaks on time they practically hounded us to do so, going so far as to sub employees out with someone else if they were in deep helping a customers and needed to take a break. I'm not saying this suit doesn't have merit; I have no doubt some stores and managers did not follow the law. However, to put this on the level of institutional malfeasance? I don't think so. Rating: 6 Votes keysofanxiety 4 weeks ago I just received a check for $0.04 (yes, 4 cents!) as a settlement for an AT&T class action lawsuit. :eek: Don't spend it all at once! Rating: 4 Votes ghanwani 4 weeks ago Does anything good ever come from class action suits? Maybe it helps conditions for future employees/customers/etc. I just received a check for $0.04 (yes, 4 cents!) as a settlement for an AT&T class action lawsuit. Rating: 4 Votes eebrown 4 weeks ago Why any company wants to have a business in CA is beyond me, granted you have to treat employees fair but CA seems to go overboard. My company is being sued for the same thing in that state and knowing the facts as I do with my company it is real apparent it's a money grab by the employee and the lawyers. Can't speak about the apple charges but I would assume it's blown out of portion. Rating: 4 Votes macs4nw 4 weeks ago I had expected better from Apple. Rating: 4 Votes 62tele 4 weeks ago I side with Apple. This is one of the reason why US companies move factories to China. No it's not. Employees deserve to be treated fairly and have a break. You think our citizens deserve to work in such conditions like the sweat shops in China? If so, this would be an example of US workers not being respected or valued. By your logic I suppose it's perfectly fine that top executives now earn, on average 200 to 300 times the average worker. For reference the ratio has gone up from 120-to-1 in 2000, 42-to-1 in 1980 and 20-to-1 in 1950. Count me on the employee's side.

 Apple's latest hire could signal a big shift in the company's approach to AI Kif Leswing Oct. 17, 2016, 12:50 PM 5,010 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple's Ruslan SalakhutdinovVideoLectures.net Every big company in Silicon Valley is chasing artificial intelligence, the increasingly powerful computer software that can learn from big sets of data almost like a human does.  And Apple just hired one of the big guns of AI research, as the company continues to try to prove that it is not falling behind Google and its other rivals in the hot field. Ruslan Salakhutdinov announced on Twitter on Monday that he's joining Apple as a director of AI research. Salakhutdinov will continue to do work at Carnegie Mellon University, where he advises and does research on deep learning, a key AI technique.  His hiring raises the question of whether Apple's growing AI team will take a more academic approach to AI research going forward. One of the big reasons why people believe that Apple is falling behind in the field is that Apple's researchers don't publish their research, because Apple has traditionally kept its methods secret until a new product is launched. That secretive approach may be hampering Apple's recruiting efforts in the AI field, where many of the top researchers want to see their work published. By contrast, Google and its AI subsidiary, DeepMind, publish their research all the time. Facebook's head of AI research, Yann LeCun, still puts his name on papers, including one (Recurrent Orthogonal Networks and Long-Memory Tasks) from June of this year, that are frequently published on Facebook's research page.  VideoLectures.net Apple did not immediately return a request for comment about what Salakhutdinov will be working on in his new role, though the company has numerous products with obvious artificial intelligence needs, from its Siri virtual assistant to self-driving cars. According to Salakhutdinov's faculty page on the CMU website, he's interested in deep learning, probabilistic graphical models, and large-scale optimization.  One of his recent talks discusses deep learning model that could be used to, say, write captions for various photos, a similar task to a new photo feature Apple introduced in the latest version of the iPhone software. His most recent paper discusses ways that machines can understand text and other documents.  SEE ALSO: Apple is trying to fight Google's artificial intelligence with one hand tied behind its back NOW WATCH: This hidden iPhone feature will boost your reception Loading video...

Supplier Deserves More Credit This chipmaker builds many of the less talked about chips inside of Apple's flagship smartphones. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Oct 17, 2016 at 12:22PM Image source: Intel.  It's well-known that Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd. (NYSE:TSM) is the sole supplier of Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) A10 Fusion processor that powers the recently released iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus smartphones. The chip is manufactured in TSMC's 16-nanometer technology, and according to Chipworks, it even employs TSMC's InFO chip packaging technology. (In a nutshell, this means more dollar content for TSMC beyond wafer manufacturing services.) Although much of the focus in the press is around the manufacturer of Apple's A-series processor, it's important to note that there are a lot of chips inside of a smartphone. None are as high value as the applications processor, but the content is significant nonetheless. TSMC has clearly done a good job of nabbing Apple's A-series business over the last several years, but investors shouldn't ignore the fact that it builds many of the other chips inside of Apple's iPhones, as well. Let's take a look at several examples. The cellular modem (and related RF) Apple is probably the last major smartphone vendor to use stand-alone applications processors and cellular modems. In the iPhone 7, teardown reports have revealed that Apple is sourcing cellular modems (and associated chips) from both Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), a longtime supplier of Apple modems, and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). The Qualcomm modem, known as MDM9645, is known to be manufactured in TSMC's 20-nanometer manufacturing process. The Intel modem, branded XMM 7360, is built in a foundry 28-nanometer process. BlueFin Research Partners say that this part, too, is manufactured by TSMC. Beyond the baseband processor, though, TSMC is believed to be a key manufacturer of the RF transceivers used in iPhones, as well. Chipworks says that the RF transceiver that's used in the Intel version of the iPhone 7/7 Plus is built by TSMC, and it's likely that Qualcomm's RF transceivers are built by TSMC, as well. The fingerprint sensor Back in 2015, DigiTimes reported that the fingerprint sensors inside of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus smartphones were manufactured in TSMC's 0.18-micron manufacturing technology. That same report also claimed that the second-generation fingerprint sensors inside of the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus are manufactured in TSMC's newer 65-nanometer manufacturing technology. At Apple's keynote and in its marketing materials for the iPhone 7-series smartphones, the company makes no mention of dramatic changes to the fingerprint sensor. It's likely, then, that Apple is using the same sensor in the iPhone 7-series phones as it did in the iPhone 6s-series phones. In that case, TSMC profits from the iPhone by manufacturing the Touch ID sensor, as well. The connectivity combo chip The Wi-Fi/Bluetooth connectivity combo chip, as well as the GPS chip inside of the iPhone 7-series phones, are almost certainly both provided by Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO). (Chipworks confirmed the latter, and Broadcom's public commentary confirms the former.) According to a 2014 form 10-K filing, Broadcom counted TSMC as one of its main contract chip manufacturing partners. And back in 2012, Chipworks confirmed that the Broadcom Wi-Fi/Bluetooth combo chip inside of the iPhone 5 was manufactured by TSMC. I believe that it's very likely that TSMC is one of the manufacturers -- if not the only one -- of the Wi-Fi/Bluetooth connectivity combo chips inside of the iPhone 7-series smartphones. No wonder TSMC rakes in so much from smartphones In TSMC's most recent earnings presentation, the company said that a full 60% of its revenue in the quarter came from communication products. This includes, and is likely mostly comprised of, chips that go into smartphones. It's not surprising, given how much content within major smartphones like the iPhone 7 it is responsible for manufacturing, that the company has benefited so much from the smartphone boom. Going forward, as smartphone unit shipment growth cools off, TSMC is going to have to rely increasingly on content growth within smartphones -- through share gains, selling higher value technologies, and so on -- to try to outperform the overall smartphone market.  Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel and Qualcomm.

It just added Carnegie Mellon's Russ Salakhutdinov to its research team. By Larry Dignan for Between the Lines | October 17, 2016 -- 16:42 GMT (09:42 PDT) | Topic: Innovation Apple is adding a professor at Carnegie Mellon as a director of artificial intelligence research as the company continues with a hiring spree in machine learning. In a tweet, Russ Salakhutdinov, a professor at Carnegie Mellon, said he was joining Apple to lead an AI research team and encouraged folks to apply. According to his bio "primary interests lie in deep learning, machine learning, and large-scale optimization. His main research goal is to understand the computational and statistical principles required for discovering structure in large amounts of data." Salakhutdinov also indicated that Google Research, Microsoft Research, Samsung, DARPA, and Raytheon BBN have all been funding sources for his research. The tweet from Salakhutdinov indicated that he will continue as an associate professor at Carnegie Mellon. With Google touting its machine learning and AI knowhow across hardware and software, Apple has attempted a hiring spree of sorts. A search on Apple's job board indicates that there are 129 positions open revolving around machine learning. Many of those positions were posted in recent months.

Russ Salakhutdinov said he is looking to hire more research scientists in the field to work on his team at Apple. He will continue his work at Carnegie Mellon in addition to his new role at Apple. Excited about joining Apple as a director of AI research in addition to my work at CMU. Apply to work with my teamhttps://t.co/U2hQl2GdhA— Russ Salakhutdinov (@rsalakhu) October 17, 2016 The move comes as Apple’s Siri has been criticized for having fallen behind other automated assistants, such as Amazon’s Alexa and Microsoft’s Cortana, while Google is also betting big on its Google Assistant. Apple has also made several acquisitions related to machine learning, including Seattle-based Turi, which sold for a reported $200 million. Salakhutdinov’s recent research (PDF) has included work on how to better derive the context behind the questions people pose. Jack Clark, a former reporter who works at nonprofit artificial intelligence research firm OpenAI, called the hire a “huge get” for Apple. “Russ does amazing research,” Clark said on Twitter. At the same time, he questioned what Salakhutdinov’s dual role at Apple and Carnegie Mellon will mean for his research. “Does this mean Apple will publish papers now?” he asked. “Otherwise, their gain is the world's loss.” We’ve reached out to Apple and Salakhutdinov, but have yet to hear back. recode_divider More From Recode Donald Trump says his tweeting as president will be ‘very restrained,’ even as he trolls the New York Times today Embrace anti-reality: One of Peter Thiel’s partners pens an anti-Trump manifesto that is actually sensible Should you ignore the Trump dump of tech stocks?

That was true, and the agency later opened a new L.A. office and hired a couple dozen staffers to handle the new business. Today marks the debut of Anomaly’s first work for the client, which is all about one particular aspect of Apple’s new product line: cord-free headphones. The ad is set to the maybe-classic “I’ve Got No Strings,” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a pretty clear theme: All of these famous people are doing things that might be at least a little bit more difficult if they had to wear phones with cords. We even recognized most of the seemingly random personalities who are living freer, more rewarding lives thanks to this one weird trick. It’s kind of fun to see a person like Amber Rose who specializes in self-promotion make a joke at her own expense, light as it may be. People like Conan O’Brien can make fun of Apple’s insistence on eliminating headphone cords all they want, but the company isn’t hearing it as they clearly believe the future to be 100 percent wireless. The work above also gives us a good idea as to what Anomaly’s future work for Beats will look like, given that it features lots of celebs using the products in sort-of relatable situations. One does have to wonder whether the company will change its approach after global CMO Omar Johnson leaves next month, though.

The company had planned to launch "Project Titan" in 2019. However, internal in-fighting and catastrophic leadership failures have caused it to be abandoned. At its peak, Apple had around 1,000 people assigned to Titan. Recently, "hundreds of members" of the team have been reassigned, let go or left of their own volition though, according to Bloomberg. The shakeup has been so severe that Apple has rethought the entire project. The company will no longer build its own car, instead focusing on the software that could make autonomous vehicles a reality. The original plan was to make an all-electric car that would recognise its driver using Touch ID fingerprint recognition. The car would then autonomously navigate to its destination at the press of a button, integrating with existing Apple services such as Maps and Music for the driver's convenience. The initial concept retained the steering wheel and pedals but these were dropped in later iterations of the idea to achieve a more radical first product. However, problems with the manufacturing of the car have since led Apple to drop the plan entirely. By focusing on software, it aims to deliver a quality product that could appeal to existing car brands. It will in effect create a framework enabling autonomous vehicles to be built on top of Apple technology. The new team has been given a deadline of late 2017 to prove to the company's leadership that self-driving systems can become a reality. They will then need to decide on a definitive direction for the project, company insiders told Bloomberg. The aim is to develop software that could power an autonomous car for installation on vehicles built by existing manufacturer. The approach is also flexible enough to enable Apple to restart work on Titan at some later date. According to Bloomberg, the focus shift and revised deadline have come "after months of strategy disagreements, leadership flux and supply chain challenges." The company has found it difficult to create a supply chain for automotive parts, finding it a challenge to gain the same presence as it has in electronics. Existing investors are also sceptical of the plans. Apple's used to making large profit margins whereas car manufacturers typically take less than 10 percent profit. The problems led to internal disputes that threw the entire project into disarray. For much of last year, there was no clear direction in the company's work, according to insiders. Managers argued over strategies and whether to emphasise hardware or software. A lack of coordination and a general inability to build a firm plan caused the project to gradually fall apart in "an incredible failure of leadership." Apple is known for its strong command of markets. It is a major influencer in the consumer electronics space that has almost complete control over its relationships with its partners. Its failure to unite around a single self-driving car concept indicates the challenge technology companies face when considering the automotive market. The company is not alone in being thwarted by unforeseen issues while building self-driving cars. Google's own project has also suffered from unexpected departures, rethinks and cautious investments, although it is has made it much further along the road than Apple.

Resend activation e-mail Cars Technica / All things automotive Connected cars are cash cows; low margins may have killed the Apple Car Not enough profit in cars for tech, but plenty of profit in tech for the car industry. by Jonathan M. Gitlin - Oct 17, 2016 4:18 pm UTC Login to bookmark 96 Aurich Lawson A pair of articles published on Monday by Bloomberg and Fast Company provide an interesting snapshot of the ongoing collision between the tech and automotive industries. In the former, Mark Gurman and Alex Webb provide a fuller exploration of Apple's ongoing "Project Titan" than we've read to date. The "so secret we can't talk about it" car R&D is believed to have been heavily scaled back—along with Apple's vehicular ambitions. The once thousand-strong team has now lost hundreds of members, particularly those working on a car OS, as well as chassis and suspension design, Bloomberg reports. Perhaps Apple's scaled-back plans were inevitable; according to Bloomberg, "Apple executives had imagined an electric car that could recognize its driver by fingerprint and autonomously navigate with the press of a button." Meanwhile, Rick Tetzili at Fast Company takes a look at General Motors under Mary Barra's leadership. Like others in the car business, GM has realized its future is as much in technology as it is in building the vehicles themselves. It therefore has designs on the clever young brains that currently flock to Silicon Valley and so is doing its bit to make working at GM an appealing prospect. Tech's influence is becoming more and more pervasive throughout the car industry, from open source design competitions and hackathons to virtual assembly lines and safety system demonstrations. But what the auto industry really wants is technology's profit margins. Indeed, the low returns involved in building and selling cars is put forward as one reason that Apple has changed focus for Project Titan. On the other side of the fence, every car maker that is including 4G LTE connectivity in its new vehicles can see the dollar signs—tens of billions of them by 2020, according to Ben Volkow, CEO of otonomo, a company that is working with a number of OEMs, including Daimler, on cloud platforms. The big car companies have already made the big investments: "The databases are built, the modems are in the cars, they've crossed the Rubicon," Volkow told Ars. Part of the strategy is to build ongoing relationships with their customers through services like predictive maintenance. Part of it is to profit from your data the same way Google or Apple (or your pharmacy) does. That second one is bound to set some whiskers a-twitching, we're sure. It'll probably also mean an end to vehicle data plans. After all, if my car is going to make money from me, it better not have the gall to give me a cellphone bill at the end of every month, too.

Report: Apple Taking A Big Step Back From Electric Car Plans Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Report: Apple Taking A Big Step Back From Electric Car Plans Image courtesy of (josepqr) October 17, 2016 10:23 am EST By Mary Beth Quirk@marybethquirk hit the brakes apple autonomous cars self-driving cars self-driving systems cars vehicles automobiles technology A little over a year ago, Apple was speeding up its quest to join the electric car market, announcing that it hoped to have a vehicle ready by 2019. Fast forward to today, and the company is reportedly putting the brakes on that plan. Apple no longer plans to build a car, at least not for now, those ever-insightful “people familiar with the matter” tell Bloomberg, resulting in a shakeup in the workforce attached to “Project Titan”: out of the 1,000 people on the car team, hundreds have been let go, reassigned, or have gone elsewhere on their own recently, the insiders said. There’s a new team on the project and they’re now focused on developing an autonomous driving system instead, one that would allow Apple to partner with existing carmakers or decide to design its own vehicle after all, those in the know explained. The head honchos have handed down a deadline of late 2017 to prove that a self-driving system could become a reality and decide on a final direction, insiders claim, while an Apple spokesman declined to comment to Bloomberg. Apple isn’t the only one struggling to figure out how to build a branded car, despite success in the world of mobile gadgets and technology: Google has also had issues, and has said it will work with all carmakers in its driverless car quest.

(GPRO) Stock Slammed by Karma Drone Recall Recent Posts: Why Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Ended the Free Supercharger Ride Apple Inc.’s (AAPL) New MacBook Pro Is Actually a Monster Hit GoPro Inc. (GPRO) Stock Slammed by Karma Drone Recall View All Posts Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been looking for its next big hit, and a self-driving, electric car looked to be it. However, Project Titan has been rumored to be plagued by numerous challenges that resulted in the company parachuting in new leadership for its Apple car. Source: Apple Now Bloomberg is reporting AAPL’s auto ambitions are in trouble, with hundreds of staff departures, dropped plans to build its own car and a 2017 deadline to prove the feasibility of moving forward with developing a self-driving software platform. Project Titan’s Secretive Road With slowing iPhone sales in its future, Apple was looking for a new product that would deliver serious revenue. Not Apple TV or Apple Watch revenue, but big numbers. The auto market — valued at nearly four times the size of the smartphone market and dominated by the kind of older, entrenched companies AAPL likes to shake up — was a prime target. 9 Best Stocks to Buy Amid Market Turmoil With the success of Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Alphabet Inc’s (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google self-driving car, Apple was believed to have green lit its own electric car in 2014. Under the code-name of Project Titan, AAPL began assembling a team of automotive engineers tasked with building an electric Apple car. Soon there were reports of Apple minivans prowling the streets of California, top-secret testing tracks and complaints that AAPL was poaching electric car talent from Tesla and its suppliers. The Wheels Start to Fall Off In January 2016, the 17-year Apple veteran leading up Project Titan abruptly left the company. AAPL brought in senior executive and special projects expert Bob Mansfield to take over in the summer. The hiring of a former head of BlackBerry Ltd’s (NASDAQ:BBRY) QNX auto software division marked a potential shift in focus from an electric car to a self-driving car. AAPL was reportedly targeting 2021 as an Apple car release date at this point. In September, rumors began to circulate that Apple was “rebooting” Project Titan. The challenges of building its own car, including trying to coordinate suppliers and sourcing a manufacturing partner, were proving too difficult. Now, the report published in Bloomberg and citing “people familiar with the project” says Project Titan is being scaled back in a big way. There have been hundreds of job cuts and more staff have chosen to bail. According to Bloomberg, remaining engineers are largely focusing on autonomous driving software and sensors. Project Titan appears to have been not only dramatically scaled back, but Apple’s automotive plans in general seem to be at a crossroads. Bloomberg says: “Apple executives have given the car team a deadline of late next year to prove the feasibility of the self-driving system and decide on a final direction.” As pointed out in the Bloomberg report, AAPL may be coming to grips with the reality of an automotive market that may have seemed ripe for the picking, but is in reality much more difficult to disrupt. Although the industry is expected to be worth a whopping $6.7 trillion by 2030, it’s dominated by companies like Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) that have been in business for over a century. Profit margins aren’t the 60% or more AAPL can wring out of the iPhone, they are more like 10%. And with thousands of parts and suppliers who are reluctant to commit to a low-volume new auto maker, the supply chain is far more complex than Apple has experience with. Bank of America (BAC) Stock Is a Screaming Buy After Q3 Earnings At this point, it looks as though TSLA’s place as the marquee high-tech car manufacturer is safe — at least from Apple. Instead, Project Titan is completing a pivot toward chasing Google’s self-driving car project, with the potential to license the software to car manufacturers the way it does with its CarPlay infotainment software. At least if the company ultimately decides even that is feasible… As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Hundreds of members of the car team, which comprises about 1 000 people, have been reassigned, let go, or have left of their own volition in recent months, the people said, asking not to be identified because the moves aren’t public. New leadership of the initiative, known internally as Project Titan, has re-focused on developing an autonomous driving system that gives Apple flexibility to either partner with existing carmakers, or return to designing its own vehicle in the future, the people also said. Apple has kept staff numbers in the team steady by hiring people to help with the new focus, according to another person. Apple executives have given the car team a deadline of late next year to prove the feasibility of the self-driving system and decide on a final direction, two of the people said. Apple spokesman Tom Neumayr declined to comment.

Apple isn’t the first to realise mastery of mobile gadgets and software updates is no guarantee of automotive success. Alphabet Inc.’s Google learned the challenges of building its own vehicles and has sought partners. Its car project has also suffered departures. Tech investors are dubious too. They’re used to fat profit margins, while carmakers survive on net margins well below 10 percent. “For a quality Apple-branded car they could probably get a healthy margin,” said Eric Paul Dennis, an analyst at the Center for Automotive Research. “They probably weren’t willing to compromise on quality issues" because that could hurt the perception of its other products, he added. Apple started Titan in 2014 with grand ambitions to make a dent in an auto industry that consultant McKinsey & Company estimates will be worth $6.7 trillion by 2030. The iPhone maker embarked upon an aggressive hiring spree, and an Apple-designed vehicle was targeted by the early 2020s. The hope was to revolutionise cars in the way the iPhone upended the mobile industry in 2007. Internal strife By the end of 2015, the project was blighted by internal strife. Managers battled about the project’s direction, according to people with knowledge of the operations. “It was an incredible failure of leadership,” one of the people said. In early 2016, project head Steve Zadesky, a former Ford engineer and early iPod designer, left Titan. Zadesky, who remains at Apple, declined to comment. Read also: Apple named biggest tax avoider in US Zadesky handed the reins to his boss, Dan Riccio, adding to responsibilities that already included engineering annual iPhone, iPad, and Mac refreshes. Bob Mansfield, a highly regarded manager who helped develop the original iPad, returned in April from a part-time role at Apple to lead the team. About a month later, Mansfield took the stage in a Silicon Valley auditorium packed with hundreds of Titan employees to announce the strategy shift, according to people who attended the meeting. Mansfield explained that he had examined the project and determined that Apple should move from building an outright competitor to Tesla Motors Inc. to an underlying self-driving platform. Departures In the following months, engineers started leaving. Some chose to quit amid doubts over job security and skepticism that an Apple car product would ever come to market. Others were cut. In August, a first wave of employees was let go, followed by a second round in September. More than 120 software engineers working on a car operating system and testing procedures were cut. Several hundred hardware engineers working on car chassis, suspensions, and undercarriages also left, the people said. The New York Times reported in September that Apple had cut dozens of employees from Titan. John Wright, a veteran Apple manager who led the software teams, has left the project, according to people familiar with the matter. Dan Dodge, creator of BlackBerry’s QNX car software, took a larger role developing Apple’s auto platform architecture, some of those people said. Remaining software engineers are working on autonomous programs, vision sensors, and simulators for testing the platform in real-world environments. The team also has regulatory specialists to navigate the heavily regulated auto industry, one of the people said. Far cry It’s a far cry from early plans that excited Apple executives. "The car is the ultimate mobile device, isn’t it?" COO Jeff Williams said in 2015. Soon after, CEO Tim Cook said the auto industry was "at an inflection point for massive change." Apple executives had imagined an electric car that could recognise its driver by fingerprint and autonomously navigate with the press of a button. One plan sought a partially autonomous car that still had a steering wheel and pedals, while later plans migrated toward a fully autonomous vehicle. Regardless of Apple’s struggles, established carmakers have recognised the threat posed by new entrants and have embarked on a hiring and acquisition splurge to beef up their software capabilities. They are wary of allowing technology companies to own the lucrative software component of new cars. Apple meanwhile struggled to tackle complex automotive supply chains, according to another person familiar with the situation. In smartphones, Apple wields extensive influence and often secures exclusive rights to certain parts from suppliers. For cars, the heavy investment required to make automotive parts means suppliers are less willing to commit their products to a vehicle like Apple’s which may have initially shipped in small quantities. "When they started digging into the details of what that would entail it likely became an intractable problem," the Center for Automotive Research’s Dennis said.

October 1, 2015 AAPL: 109.58 -0.72 Apple reportedly wants ‘AirPods’ trademark using shell company, suggesting Apple-branded wireless earbuds Zac Hall - 1 year ago @apollozac AirPods AAPL Company Apple Beats Wireless Comments (22) Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Even in the age of the Apple Watch which only plays music over Bluetooth, Apple has yet to produce any Apple-branded wireless headphones or earbuds, instead promoting Beats-branded earbud and headphone designs created before Apple’s $3 billion acquisition of that company last year. A new report from MacRumors suggests that could soon change, however, as it’s believed Apple may have applied for “AirPods” trademark under an alias company name. If the trademark application indeed traces back to Apple, AirPods suggest a wireless version of the Apple-branded EarPod earbuds introduced in 2012. Apple’s current in-house solution for wireless earbuds, Beats Powerbeats 2, carry a premium $199 price and have an aggressive sport look, leaving room for a more neutral Apple-designed product in the future. MacRumors believes that the company listed on the AirPods trademark application, Entertainment in Flight LLC, is an Apple shell company due to its lack of any other activity, use of a Gmail address for contact information, and a priority date request for trademarking in Jamaica where online records aren’t available, activity which it says is typical of Apple when using shell companies to hide upcoming products. The possible AirPod wireless earbuds adds to the list of potential upcoming but unannounced products including an updated Apple Wireless Keyboard and Magic Mouse 2 using Bluetooth LE 4.2 as we reported earlier this year. Although those products had an early 2016 date attached to them, FCC documents suggest they may be further along than possible wireless earbuds from Apple.

Both ports take up a large amount of space in the device, and are both hinderances to water resistance, a rumored improved feature in the iPhone 7. I discount the removal of these to make the devices even thinner, if they removed them, it would much more be about reducing the incredibly valuable internal space of the devices. If they want to reduce the bezel to minimum, internal space is vitally important, but on the other hand they could retain the physical size, and reduce bezels to minimum by going in the other direction, and increasing the screen sizes further. The AirPods could have a Smart Connector on the middle control module, which could magnetically snap to your iPhone 7’s Smart Connector, for charging of the AirPods when away from a power source. Alternatively, if the lightning connector is kept (which is likely), the AirPods could have a charging cable that has a lightning port to plug into the iPhone, (or included power adaptor) on one end, and the other end would be a magnetically attractive Smart Connector, which the AirPods module would connect to, to charge. If the iPhone removed the headphone jack, lightning connector, SIM card, and Home Button, it would be naturally far better water resistance.

We’ll reconvene on that in 2022, which is how long Apple has promised the Lightning connector to remain in service. LikeLiked by 1 person o0smoothies0o - 1 year ago Show me where they said it will be around until 2022. Hahah, are you nuts? There’s not even a remote possibility that port will be there until 2022. You realize there were only 5 iPhones with the 30pin? Now there have been 4 with lightning, it’s actually very believable they’d switch again for the iPhone 7. LikeLike Le Super Flux (@le_super_flux) - 1 year ago Well, actually, the 30-pin connector had been on the iPod since 2001… So it lived for 11 years. LikeLike o0smoothies0o - 1 year ago @Le Super Flux Actually since 2003 it was used, but that was long before the crazy speed of innovation that is required for modern day smartphones. You can’t stick with technologies that could hinder miniaturization, etc., for too long, today. I just watched the lightning portion of the 2012 iPhone 5 keynote, and while Schiller did say ‘it’s a modern connector for the next decade’, that really doesn’t mean much, as they can’t know a decade out what they are going to do. It’s very possible they find a better solution before even 5 years. If you want to keep innovating and miniaturizing, you can’t stop due to the convience of keeping a connector the same. LikeLike PMZanetti - 1 year ago The day it was introduced, it was stated to be the connector for the next years. That’s a quote. Not even a remote possibility? There is not even a remote possibility that you have any idea what you’re talking about. You haven’t even seen/used the smart connector yet and you call for it to replace Lightning. Can’t you take seriously. Not even a little. LikeLike o0smoothies0o - 1 year ago You read the part in parenthesis? And no, there is no chance it will stay until 2022. That is absolutely absurd. And mind you, they don’t know what they’ll come up with in 5 years, let alone 10 years, it’s called the future, they can’t predict it. LikeLike o0smoothies0o - 1 year ago I might also add, that, of course Schiller, the senior Vice President of worldwide marketing will introduce a new port that some will be angry about, by saying it will be around for a long time (so people don’t cry about accessories). LikeLike taoprophet420 - 1 year ago Reply Besides Apple.s patents it’s strange how little has been said of the smart connector. I would rather Apple adapt USB c headsets and ditch lightning. Lightning on the MFI program as really limited manufacturers from making products. The security elements in lightning and HomeKit has really dragged out fast rollout of devices. Back in the heyday of iPods devices quickly hit the market after school iPod release. AirPlay has never cut on much and now manufacturers are releasing lower quality Bluetooth speakers. USB c would give high quality digital audio and still get rid of the ancient headphone port. 3.5 jack is 19th century product after all.

The rumor suggests itll be apple branded (unless they go with ‘Beats AirPods’) So then Apple will be selling their headphones alongside the Beats lineup. But how long before apple wants to design ‘premium’ over-ear headphones, or something similar? then they’d be selling similar products side by side under different brands, which sounds like waste of resources in my opinion.

LikeLike rahhbriley - 1 year ago Ya….and I’m kind of with you… Obviously Apple does things with their branding cleaner and different than most. We haven’t seen the Apple logo displayed along with others’ logos except for very few exceptions. (RED), Nike, IBM, Cisco are the only ones in the modern era I can think of (and obviously this is happening more). Maybe there has been something last millennium that I’m unaware of. Beats 1, I believe, was the first Beats product Apple released under the Apple banne. But it’s a sub-service of aMusic, so it fits similar patterns. So we have sub-Apple brands/products/services already under the Apple brand with their own logos/icons; iTunes, iCloud, Beats 1, etc. I really don’t see a reason they can’t call the headphone line Beats (like the computers are called Macintosh). However, I wouldn’t expect them to keep the Beats “B” logo on the heaphones, I think they would replace it with an Apple. This would be pending Apple having their way with the engineering and design. I might expect them to keep the “beats” typeface on them. My conclusion? Sell Beats in their current form…until Apple can phase them out with a new product line of Apple Beats. However, coming back to your example, I highly doubt they desire to actively develop and sell the equivalent of a Lexus’ and a Toyota. Once they design and like the new Lexus they build (Apple Beats headphones), no more Toyotas (current Beats heaphones). LikeLike taoprophet420 - 1 year ago You forgot HP iPods.)) I was using the car market as an example of how it works for other companies. I agree that the Beats name will eventually be phased out. Didn’t take Apple long for Apple to kill the a eats streaming service. I hope Apple develops its own Sonos like speakers tied into HomeKit and Apple TV. Apple has forgot about sound systems , docks and speakers. Apple used to peddle speakers to go with your Mac. Now they just promote everyones headphones.

Features Reviews Phones Android iPhone Windows Phone Apps Computers Laptops Lenovo Tablets Windows Tutorials Events More Audio Crowfunding Design/Concepts Gadgets Gaming General Photo/Video Web Ubergizmo in French Ubergizmo in German Ubergizmo in Italian Ubergizmo in Spanish Apple Has Given Up On Its Electric Car For Now By Adnan Farooqui on 10/17/2016 08:46 PST It has been rumored countless times over the past couple of years that Apple is interested in making an electric car. The project is reportedly referred to as Project Titan internally. There have been all kinds of rumors about Apple’s car ambitions but the latest report from Bloomberg claims that Apple has given up on its electric car ambitions for now. Apple is no longer said to be making an electric car to compete with the likes of Tesla. The report says that Apple has shifted its attention from making an actual car to developing self-driving software that it can deploy in partnership with existing car manufacturers. It adds that over the past few months hundreds of members from the Project Titan team have been “reassigned, let go, or have left of their own volition.” Months of strategy disagreements, supply chain challenges, and leadership flux have apparently contributed to the decision of focusing entirely on self-driving software. Apple never really confirmed that it was working on a proper car so it’s not like the company is going to comment on this report to give the public a sense of what’s happening behind closed doors. It may have given up on an electric car for now but that doesn’t mean there’s anything stopping the company from developing one on its own at some point down the line. Filed in Apple >Transportation.

Apple has updated its product for the Nike+ edition of the Apple watch revealing that it will be available from October 28th. The watch, initially unveiled at an event in San Francisco last month, is available in 38mm and 42 mm case size, and comes in a variety of colors. The watch is compatible with Apple's watch OS3 and all the apps that run on the Apple watch. Apple unveiled its co-branded watch with Nike, a leading brand in the fitness market, to appeal to customers who want more specialized exercise tracking compared to the standard model. The watch is more intended to compete with the likes of the Fit bit, Jawbone, and Samsung, which all offer fitness trackers that double as smart watches. Advertisement The Apple Nike+ edition wrist straps don't differ much in hardware from the Apple Watch Series 2. The users are really buying this for the software, can get both Nike's running app pre-installed out of the box, as well as a pair of the exclusive watch, faces geared towards athletics that the regular Apple Watch Series don't get. The more breathable straps are helpful if you can't stand in a sweaty at the end of a workout, but not as essential. The Apple Watch Nike+, like all Apple Watch Series 2, features built-in GPS to track pace, distance, and route, so users can run without an iPhone in hand. Beside this Apple, Watch Nike+ is water resistant to up to 50 meters and perfect for swimming. The Nike Sports band is shaped from the same strong, flexible as the original Apple Watch Sports Band, but it is useful for better ventilation and sweat management. The Brand comes in four vibrant, two- tone color combinations, that a really unique. The users can get the watch in both 38mm and 42mm case sizes $369 and $399 prices as the standard series 2 watches, as reported by  Engadget. This special sporty edition new Apple Watch is designed for runners. The fitness-focused smartwatch is finally ready for your wrist.

[Photo: courtesy of Dexcom] Tim Bajarin 10.17.16 10:00 AM We all know about the market for wearable health trackers, but in my case the Apple Watch has become an indispensable health monitor. I’ve been a type 2 diabetic for about 25 years, and for most of that time I was able to control it through diet, exercise, and oral medications. But on a trip last March, my blood sugar readings skyrocketed, and no amount of medication or diet would help. When I went to see my doctor, he explained that, over time, oral drugs cease to work for many people, and when they do, it's time to move to insulin. I had been fighting this move for the previous five years, but under the circumstances, I needed insulin to get my blood sugar numbers under control. The transition to using insulin was a difficult one. It was tough to determine the right amount, based on a carb count and other metrics. I was pricking my fingers up to seven times a day. For a working person who travels a lot, doing this is difficult. That's why I've been so interested lately in a new category of health monitoring devices emerging with the Apple Watch. I’ve checked out things like the Withings Blood Pressure Cuff, where the results can be shown directly on the watch display. I’ve also tried a new Apple Watch band that can record an EKG and display it on the watch. These worked well enough, so I began searching for a blood sugar monitoring system. That's when I discovered the Dexcom G5, a mobile continuous glucose monitoring, or CGM, system. I was aware of the company’s early models but had read that they had some problems, so I was hesitant to buy in at first. When the newer Dexcom G5 came out, I saw more positive reviews. What sold me was that, in the new model, the readings could be displayed on my iPhone and Apple Watch. And as luck would have it, the system was covered by my insurance. It requires a prescription, so I asked for one from my doctor. I was pricking my fingers up to seven times a day. For a working person who travels a lot, doing this is difficult. About two months ago, I received it and started using it to monitor my blood sugars. The system, which attaches to the abdomen, consists of a small sensor and a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) transmitter. A small needle-like prong—the equivalent of two human hairs—embeds just beneath the skin (I hardly feel it going in) and checks my blood sugar fluids every five minutes, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Each sensor lasts seven days. As Dexcom explains, monitoring blood sugar fluids is a bit different than monitoring actual blood, but doing so yields readings that are accurate to within 5% to 20% of true blood sugar readings. After two months of using it, I’ve found that Dexcom readings are indeed pretty close to actual pinprick blood readings. When there is a difference, the Dexcom is off only by 10% to 15%. Those minor discrepancies are a small price to pay for the ability to monitor my blood sugar levels easily and constantly. I can look at my Apple Watch and see where my blood glucose numbers are at any time. In the past, I had no idea what the numbers were without doing a pinprick blood test. Another thing that’s been transformative is that when I eat something with carbs in it, I know how it has impacted my blood sugar numbers within 15 minutes. My target blood sugar range is between 80 and 160 Mg/dL (milligrams of glucose per deciliter of blood). I can set the Dexcom Watch app to alert me (with a loud beep) when my numbers stray from that range. I actually try to keep the numbers under 140, and this app really helps me do that. The Dexcom G5 paired with the Apple Watch could change the lives of people with type 1 diabetes who are insulin dependent. The alarms alone are worth the price. Even for me, a type 2 diabetic, the device has become a tool that I can’t live without. Sure, I could go back to pinpricks—but I could never do that all day, every day. With this new health monitoring device and the Apple Watch, I have one of the most effective tools I have ever used to help me deal with this disease in a proactive way. Today there are more than 29 million diabetics in the United States, and unfortunately that number is growing. The best thing that could happen is for science to find a cure, but in the meantime, improvements in wearables and apps make dealing with diabetes much more bearable. Never miss a story.

TIM GRAY The New York Times News Service Published Monday, Oct. 17, 2016 11:17AM EDT Last updated Monday, Oct. 17, 2016 11:17AM EDT Comments AA Many stock-picking styles have sizzled lately, with growth and value and domestic and international investing all toting up gains. Three of the better-performing mutual funds of recent months found their winners among small- and large-cap growth stocks and Chinese shares. — Hood River Small-Cap Growth Fund The managers of the Hood River Small-Cap Growth Fund — Robert C. Marvin, Brian P. Smoluch and David G. Swank — say they prefer to sleuth among small caps because they are monitored less widely than giants like Apple and Amazon. “Our typical company might have only six analysts following it, compared to maybe 50 for Apple,” Mr. Smoluch said. The Hood River managers say there is a “research gap” that they can fill, thanks to their 20 years of work with small caps. The three met in the 1990s while working at what was then Columbia Management in Portland, Oregon. In the early 2000s, Mr. Smoluch and Mr. Marvin created a predecessor to their fund at Roxbury Capital Management. A few years later, they recruited Mr. Swank, and, in 2013, the three started Hood River Capital Management, also in Portland. As stock pickers, they’re generalists, surveying all parts of the market. They will scoop up several companies in a field if they see growing companies benefiting from a broader trend. They have done that in fiber optics, with holdings like Oclaro, Fabrinet and Finisar, all recent double-digit gainers. “For a while, there was a huge overcapacity of components for fiber networks,” Mr. Smoluch said. “But you’ve had a major industry consolidation combined with accelerating demand,” as networks upgrade to meet the bandwidth needs of smartphones, cloud computing and video streaming. In researching a promising company, they talk with its competitors, customers and suppliers. They estimate they make about 1,000 calls a year. Talks with pharmaceutical and biotech executives led them to a holding in PRA Health Sciences. “It’s a contract research organization that manages clinical trials,” Mr. Swank said. “Based on our conversations, we believe it’s gaining market share, and the entire industry is being helped along by the high level of biotech financing that happened in 2015.” The institutional shares of the Hood River fund, with an expense ratio of 1.49 per cent, returned 15.01 per cent in the third quarter, compared with 3.85 per cent for the Standard & Poor’s 500 index. — Fidelity OTC Portfolio Gavin S. Baker, manager of the Fidelity OTC Portfolio, invests in growth companies, too. But to fill his fund, which contains 174 stocks and $13.6-billion in assets, he leans to large caps. The biggest components of the index are tech stalwarts like Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft and Amazon. Mr. Baker builds his portfolio around themes that he sees shaping technology and the economy, like the emergence of artificial intelligence, and seeks stocks with strategies that will play out over three to seven years. Market attention tends to be short-term, creating opportunities for people who can be more patient, he said. He has long held Amazon shares, for example, even as other investors have said they are overvalued, based on the price-earnings ratio. “Amazon has gone, over the last 15 years, from $5 to $840,” he said. “At some point, you’d think people would wear down and realize that looking at it on current-period earnings isn’t the right way to think about it.” As for artificial intelligence, the theme enters his portfolio through stocks like Alphabet and Tesla. Mr. Baker says he sees self-driving cars as an eventual safety boon, despite current problems. “More than a million people die every year driving,” he said. “Self-driving cars will never drive drunk or high or distracted. They won’t be texting and driving.” Artificial intelligence favors the biggest tech companies, he said, because it demands lots of data and cheap, powerful computing, both of which they have in abundance. Mr. Baker has managed his fund since 2009, and over the last five years, it has been one of the top performers among large-cap growth funds, returning an annualized average of 18.53 per cent. In the third quarter, it returned 11.89 per cent. The fund has an expense ratio of 0.91 per cent. — Matthews China Fund Andrew V. Mattock, lead portfolio manager of the Matthews China Fund, also invests in companies aiming to grow at faster than average rates — but his stocks all do business in China. Mr. Mattock took the job a little more than a year ago. He had previously worked as an Asia manager, based in Singapore, for Henderson Global Investors. The fund holds only 36 stocks, a deliberately focused selection, he said. “You have to choose between the last two to get down to the one you really like,” he said. For several years, worrisome economic news has streamed from China — reports of a slowing economy, overheated real estate markets and banks fat with problem loans. Mr. Mattock said such macro scares have buffeted China portfolios, on and off, for the roughly 15 years he has been investing in the country. But the “obsession with macro,” he said, has overshadowed a continued maturation of Chinese companies that offers opportunities for committed investors. “We have a lot of the big industry leaders in the portfolio, and these macro stories meant I could pick them up at a very good price,” he said. In insurance, for example, the fund owns Ping An and China Life, two of the country’s biggest insurers. In e-commerce, it holds Alibaba and Vipshop Holdings. Alibaba and Vipshop are leading e-commerce companies. The Matthews fund, with an expense ratio of 1.14 per cent, returned 14.95 pe rcent in the third quarter.

Daniel Cooper , @danielwcooper 10.17.16 in Transportation Comments 1197 Shares Share Tweet Share Save Remember Apple's ambitious, long-rumored and totally not top-secret plan to build a self-driving car for the masses? According to Bloomberg, it's dead, with several hundred employees being reassigned to other parts of the company's business. The project, codenamed Titan, has been scaled back from a full-blown vehicle to simply a self-driving system that can be sold to car makers for use in their own vehicles. It gets worse, since Titan's leaders have been told that their team needs to produce something feasible before the end of 2017, or else. We've been hearing nothing but rumors about Apple's intentions in the self-driving car space for the last few years. But apparently there's been behind-the-scenes chaos since 2015, when managers began to argue about what the Apple car would take. The report quotes an unnamed source saying that Titan was "an incredible failure of leadership" until Apple stalwart Bob Mansfield came over to lead the team. It was Mansfield who re-shaped the project, killing the idea of building a Tesla competitor and concentrate on a technology platform that could be sold to third parties. The piece also mentions how Apple's well-seasoned executives seemed to struggle with the problematic nature of automotive supply chain. The firm is famous for throwing its weight (and cash) around to secure large quantities of components for its computers and smartphones. But apparently this track record didn't carry over to manufacturers who make car parts, who weren't prepared to make the necessary investment. Coupled with talented employees going elsewhere and Apple's poor record of partnering with third parties and it looks like we can kiss our dreams of a drivable iPhone goodbye.

October 17 AAPL: 117.55 -0.08 The obscure legal mechanism Apple uses to keep its trademark filings secret for six months Ben Lovejoy - 4 weeks ago @benlovejoy AAPL Trademark View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit If you want to know what products a company like Apple plans to launch, trademark filings can be a good way to find out because anyone can search them. Apple’s registration of the trademark ‘Apple Watch’ was a bit of a giveaway, for example. But there is one way tech companies can keep them secret for the first six months, and it’s a method Apple has used no fewer than 343 times: taking advantage of section 44(d) of the US Trademark Act … Section 44(d) says that when you apply for a trademark in the USA, your protection begins up to six months before you filed for the trademark – provided you can prove you’ve already registered it in another country. As Quartz reports, most countries put their trademark registrations online, so they are trivial to search. But a number of countries don’t, and Jamaica is one of them. If you want to search trademark filings there, you have to fly to Kingston to perform the search in person. So what Apple does is to file its trademarks there first, wait six months and then apply in the USA. To provide an additional layer of security, Apple generally uses shell companies to file the Jamaican applications, so that nothing is listed against its own name. While all big tech companies do this, Apple does so more than most, says former USPTO trademark examiner Roberto Ledesma. Some companies avail themselves of section 44(d) more than others. Apple, for example, has lodged more than three times as many foreign trademark filings as Google, the next in the ranking. The reason only large companies do it is that it’s not cheap, according to one legal expert. “I haven’t seen this technique applied in a really pervasive way—I think it’s quite an obscure approach,” says Madhani of Alt Legal. “It’s generally going to be used by companies with real legal resources … and the willingness to spend to protect something for six months.” Especially as it offers no guarantee of success: there are fairly frequent leaks of trademark applications by Apple shell companies in Jamaica. This was how we first heard about the AirPods trademark a full year before the product launch, for example. But with Apple’s legal and financial resources, it doubtless falls into the ‘can’t hurt to try’ category.

Apart from riding the bullet train to travel around the country, Apple’s CEO did an interview to share some interesting things about the company’s plans for its Japan-based R&D center. Speaking with Nikkei Asian Review, Cook revealed that Apple’s R&D facility in Yokohama, which is close to Japan’s capital city Tokyo and is expected to be completed this December, will serve as the core of the tech giant’s “deep engineering.” Steve Jobs’ successor admitted that he is remaining mum about what this is all about, but he did say that Apple is capitalizing on AI in cooperation with Japanese companies.  Cook shared that they plan to make the most out of AI by crafting technologies that would be very useful, such as increasing battery life of certain products or recommending songs to Apple Music users. He added that AI could also be useful in remembering where someone parked his or her car.  According to AppleInsider, although what Cook mentioned are tasks that are mostly available to the tech giant’s platforms, such as Siri, there is still room for improvement. The Apple-centric news site also stated that Cook is simply suggesting that they are pushing the Yokohama-based R&D center to take AI research to new directions.  Related Stories Apple iPhone 4, MacBook Air Late 2010 To Be Discontinued Disgruntled Samsung Customers Are Not Buying Phones From Apple Rival Again Patent Reveals New Apple Watch Wristband Technology In his interview, he maintained that the focus of Apple’s R&D center in Japan is “very different” from the center they plan to construct in China. This is despite the ambiguity in how Japan fares in AI technology at the moment as there is no trace that the country is invested in deep learning from analyzed data, as per MacRumors.  Nevertheless, it is important to note that Japan recently opened its Center for Advanced Integrated Intelligence Research in Tokyo with the goal of developing AI systems to solve issues using “Big Data.” The institution is reportedly receiving state funding next year.  Apple’s partnership with Japanese companies have so far reaped good benefits for the tech giant. For example, its endeavor involving Sony’s FeliCa for its iPhones has been very successful throughout the country. Its partnership with Nintendo is also expected to bring “Super Mario Run” to the iPhones before 2016 ends.  At the moment, Apple is working to make its iPads quite relevant in the health care sector that focuses on Japan’s elderly through its partnership with IBM and Japan Post Holdings. Cook said that Japan is the best country to try this technology out, since its population is rapidly aging.

By Casey Schmauder October 17, 2016 all photos provided   Soergel Orchards. While all fall festivals will have acres of farmland and likely hundreds of round, orange pumpkins, Soergel Orchards stands out for the amazing food you can fill up on after you hop off the hayride.  Soergels boasts two large food areas, the Back 40 Barbeque with smoked food such as pulled pork and roasted corn and the larger Food Barn with gourmet burgers and macaroni and cheese, to name just a few items. There's also an ice cream shop, bakery, organic market and vendors selling Arsenal Cider and Arrowhead wine.     For fall fun, visitors can take a hayride to a pumpkin patch on top of a hill, and then ride back down with their purchased pumpkins to see the bouncy house, pony rides and a straw tunnel. The orchards’ fall festival, which runs every Saturday and Sunday from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. from Sept. 24 through Oct. 30, has no admission charge. A hayride runs $2, games and activities run $1-$3, and pumpkins for purchase are weighed by the pound. Soergel Orchards is located at 2573 Brandt School Road, Wexford; 724/935-1743, soergels.com.     Triple B Farms. Triple B Farms stands out for creating activities that are perfect for both kids and adults. After paying for a wristband — $13 for children and $8 for adults — families can take a hayride to the play area, where there are giant inflatables, a “mildly scary” haunted house and a slingshot where parents and children can aim at targets. You can also head over to Storybook Pumpkinland, where Triple B Farms has more than 250 pumpkins decorated as nursery rhyme or children’s movie characters on display for children or the child-at-heart.     And of course, apples and pumpkins are ripe for the picking (for an additional price). Triple B Farms’ fall events run from Sept. 24 through Oct. 30. The farm is open from 4-7 p.m. Wednesday through Friday and 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Saturdays and Sundays. Triple B Farms is located at 823 Berry Lane, Forward Township; 724/258-3557, triplebfarms.com.       Trax Farms. Trax Farms has always had a hayride and pumpkin patch, but this year, for those over 21, Trax Farms will be having an event called Hops and Hayrides every Wednesday night in October. Hops and Hayrides lets adults purchase a 6-pack from the craft beer shop and take it on the hayride to enjoy during a bonfire from 4:30-7 p.m. Arsenal cider is also sold to adults on weekends. For those looking for fun for all ages, a hayride to the pumpkin patch is $8 for adults and $6 for children, with pumpkins weighed and sold separately. There’s also a free petting zoo and pony rides for $5, as well as a rock wall, bungee jump and other kid-friendly activities.     On Oct. 29 and 30, Trax Farms is hosting a Pumpkin Carving Contest where carved pumpkins can be dropped off for judging and more than $750 in prizes will be awarded. Trax claims the Best Apple Cider in Pittsburgh, and visitors should not leave without some sort of apple-flavored treats. Trax Farms sells hand-dipped caramel apples, hot and cold apple cider, apple cider slush, apple dumplings and more. Trax Farms is open from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. every Saturday and Sunday in October. Trax Farms is located at 528 Trax Road, Finleyville; 412/835-3246, traxfarms.com.       Simmons Farm. Busy on weekend days? Simmons Farm is the only farm on our list offering fall festivities every day of the week. For $11.50, visitors can take a hayride to the activity area and participate in all activities, and for an additional $3 or a total of $14.50, visitors can do the hayride, participate in activities and go home with a pumpkin of any size from the pumpkin patch. Activities include a corn maze, a corn box — a sandbox made out of corn for the kids — a jungle gym made out of tractor tires, human hamster wheels (at an additional cost), and more.     On weekends, there is also fair food available and a butterfly house.Simmons Farm also has apple and flower picking; for separate costs, visitors to the farm can pick apples or create their own flower bouquets. Simmons Farm is open from 9 a.m. to 6:45 p.m. Monday through Thursday and 9 a.m. to 5:45 p.m. Friday through Sunday through the first weekend in November. Simmons Farm is located at 170 Simmons Road, McMurray; 724/941-1490, simmonsfarm.com.     Coolspring Corn Maze. As the name suggests, Coolspring Corn Maze is known not for its pumpkin patches, but for its Corn Maze, which USA Today recently named the No. 1 corn maze in the nation. This year, the theme is “Westward Go” — Coolspring’s playful take on Pokemon Go. It costs $9.95 for access to the corn maze, hayrides, pedal tractors and other fall activities. For an additional cost, Coolspring has attractions such as mechanical bull rides, pony rides and a pumpkin blaster which shoots pumpkins at targets up to 1,000 feet away. Also, in keeping with the corn maze’s theme, Pikachu may be walking around and available for pictures during your visit.   For those who visit Coolspring’s pumpkin patch, small pumpkins can be picked for $5 and large pumpkins can be picked for $10, but the person who finds and picks the largest pumpkin of their hayride group gets their pumpkin for only $5. Coolspring Corn Maze runs from Sept. 9-Nov. 6. Hours are 4-11 p.m. Fridays, 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. Saturdays and 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. Sundays. Coolspring Corn Maze is located at 537 Franklin Road, Mercer; 724/699-3221, coolspringmaze.com.     Edit ModuleShow Tags Advertisement Edit Module Edit ModuleShow Tags The 412 The Best Times to See The Supermoon in Pittsburgh The last time the moon was this close to earth, Harry Truman was in the White House. 6 Pittsburgh Culinary Pros Honored as Rust Belt Rising Stars They are award winners is four separate categories.

This would mean the tech giant stops providing support for the device – including servicing, software updates and spare parts. Apple Inc 1 Apple’s iPhone 4 could be about to be branded ‘obsolete’ by the tech firm Apple brands products obsolete five years after it stops producing them. The company says on its website: “Owners of iPhone, iPad, iPod, or Mac products may obtain service and parts from Apple or Apple service providers for 5 years after the product is no longer manufactured—or longer where required by law. “Apple has discontinued support for certain technologically obsolete and vintage products.” Related stories NINTENDO LINKS UP WITH APPLE Nintendo games are coming to the Apple iPhone with launch of Super Mario Run WHAT A BOOB Secret porn stash found on MILLIONS of Apple iPhones as iOS 10 update allows kids to access X-rated GIFs TOUCH-GATE Apple sued over iPhone 6 'touch disease' that's allegedly WRECKING people's phones TECH GIANT UPGRADE Apple open refurbished flagship store designed to 'feel like a town square' in Regent Street 'APPY TO HELP How do I unlock my phone and take a screenshot on iOS 10?

The 13-inch Macbook Air model that was released in 2010 is also said to be about to hit the obsolete list – with 31 October touted as the deadline date, according to Japanese site Macotakara. The latest news comes ahead of speculation that the company plans to hold an event later this month to reveal updated versions of its Macbook range – and new iPads as well. Apple has shown in the past how ruthless it is willing to be with some of its older technologies and models. The smartphone manufacturer was slammed by angry customers after its recent decision to ditch its headphone jacks in the iPhone 7. And password technology could soon be heading towards the obsolete list as well, with reports claiming the iPhone 8 will be fitted with eyeball-scanning security technology.

The changes should take effect by mid November at all stores except select flagship locations. Apple will be relegating current Lead Creatives to the role of Creative as part of the transition. A source said pay will remain the same for existing leads, but their current leadership responsibilities will be slowly removed. The move comes less than three months after Apple introduced a new "Creative Pro" position above Creative. Retail employees holding this position are considered the most knowledgable about Apple products and services, providing customers with advice and expertise about products such as the iPhone. Creative Pros are situated on the sales floor, internally described as the Product Zone.

Daily Deals: Amazon Echo $120, 23-inch HP display $87, and more   skip to main content skip to main menu     KGI: Apple could add 5-7 million iPhone sales due to Note 7 discontinuation By Christian Zibreg, Oct 17, 2016 Tweet 16 Comments Global Note 7 recall and discontinuation could prove to be a blessing to Apple, helping the Cupertino firm boost iPhone sales by five to seven million units, according to KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. In a note to clients this morning, a copy of which was obtained by MacRumors, the analyst speculates that Apple and Chinese Android manufacturer Huawei could be the primary beneficiaries of the Note 7 discontinuation, with Apple potentially seeing an influx of orders for the iPhone 7 Plus due to its dual-camera system. Kuo also cautioned that another blunder similar to Note 7—especially on the upcoming Galaxy S8 smartphone—would destroy the Samsung brand. From the report: Consumers that have switched from Note 7 to iPhone after the recall and halted production can be identified as having the following characteristics: (1) no trust in the Samsung brand anymore; (2) could be former iOS users; (3) like dual camera feature; and (4) like the subsidy packages of telecom operators (iPhone 7 and 7 Plus were the most promoted flagship models in September). Kuo thinks that Apple’s biggest benefits of the Note 7 discontinuation may have already “peaked out” because the company may need up to five weeks to fulfill iPhone 7 Plus orders from ex-Note 7 customers, especially if it “does not expand the current production capacity of the iPhone 7 Plus.” Any benefits for Apple from the Note 7 fiasco are “largely reflected in raised forecasts” rather than in actual iPhone shipping numbers, reads the report. Huawei’s upcoming Mate 9 smartphone, due later this year, also features dual cameras, making it an interesting proposition for former Note 7 owners who want to stay in the Android ecosystem. Google’s recently launched Pixel and Pixel XL smartphone family is currently out of stock, but if Google manages to ramp up production quickly it could also reap some of the Note 7 customers. Korean news site ET News reported last week that Samsung is apparently “paying extra careful attention” to Galaxy S8 development due to “huge changes” in its design and hardware. But if the forthcoming phone turns out to suffer from similar mistakes as the Note 7, the Samsung brand “will be hurt immensely,” speculated the analyst.

Went through the first recall and in my mind I was thinking just go back to apple, but the Note7 was a great phone. So I got the “good one” when it came in and we know how that went. When I returned they automatically assumed I would get a S7 Edge. I turned it down and after going to 3 T-Mobile stores I finally found a iPhone 6s (last 64gb left). And ordered a 7+. The rep that helped me most that returned theirs was getting a 6s or ordering a 7. Jamessmooth did they offer you anything to stick with samsung? MvP77 Samsung is offering $100 bill credit if you switch to a edge or S7. n0ahcruz3 Thats what i said a few weeks ago, i think i should be an Analyst lmfao Rowan09 Yes if Samsung messes up the S8 it’s basically over for them. It’s time for some other Android Manufacturer to step it up and since the iPhone 8 (or whatever it will be called) is suppose to be a huge update Samsung is in for a long year in 2017. JohnS It sounds like that’s what Google aims to do with the Pixel. I wouldn’t be surprised if the Pixel ends up becoming Samsung’s biggest competition within the Android community. Rowan09 Google is positioning itself to take out all manufacturers using Android with Nougat. They added pip, etc which essential is what Samsung had on other companies, now its baked into the OS. JohnS Yeah Google has been doing that for a long time now. When they started much of their OS and apps were open source, but every year they turn more of their open source offerings into abandonware and replace them with closed source licensed apps. They are also forcing manufacturers in the Open Handset Alliance to not build any Android handsets that aren’t using Google’s proprietary apps (which is why Amazon any of the big companies to make their fire lineup). I always have to laugh when people tell me the reason they love Android is because it’s so open because they have no idea that Google is open in lip service only. Rowan09 Exactly. IOS might be more open than Google beachside iMessage is open, Siri is open, etc since IOS 10. None of Google’s services is open. JohnS I know that the UNIX OS that powers iOS and MacOS is open source (like Google) and that some select items are also open source like HealthKit, WebKit and Swift. I wasn’t aware of those other ones being open source though. Or by open did you mean extensible? Rowan09 Extensible would be a better word since IOS 10 even call kit. None of Googles services are open source and cannot be modified. Gethro Apples just jumping up and down laughing with joy right now for the opportunity JohnS I find a certain irony in that after so many years this is the one in which the long court battle between Samsung and Apple ends, but it’s also the year that Samsung messes up and potentially looses millions of customers to Apple. It’s almost like in the end things are starting to right themselves. george That’s like saying if the iPhone 7 plus was blowing up people would switch to the note 7. You don’t understand an android power user if you think anyone can just switch to iOS and be perfectly happy. JohnS You’re correct that people who are heavily invested into an eco system are not likely to switch platforms and in the largest poll done yet on this subject 54% of Samsung users said they would be sticking with Samsung, 60% plan on staying with Android but getting something else, and 28% claim they are planning on moving to Apple. 28% of the 74 million smartphones sold would indicate that potentially around 20 million people are thinking about switching. Now granted when push comes to shove and people realize what they would have to give up to switch that number will certainly more than half. But all things considered, I don’t think 5-7 million estimated sales is a huge grasp. It will be interesting to see how it all plays out though as only time will tell. jOn Garrett I’m one of those people who actually tried to buy a Note 7 AFTER the recall–not for any particular reason, I just wanted a phone that might be hard to get.   Search Connect with iDownloadBlog Facebook Become a fan RSS Get the latest news YouTube Watch Us Twitter Stay up to date Newsletter News delivered to you Google+ Add us to your circle   The most recent headlines Wallpapers of the week: golden fields Jailbreak tweaks of the week: EmojiSuggest, PasswordRecovery, & more… Recap: the top stories of the week on iDB Rushline, Feelca B&W, Delphi, and other apps to check out this weekend AT&T to throttle streaming video next year with new ‘Stream Saver’ feature   The latest jailbreak news Jailbreak tweaks of the week: EmojiSuggest, PasswordRecovery, & more… EmojiSuggest brings iOS 10-like emoji suggestions to the predictive keyboard WiJoin lets you know what Wi-Fi network you’re connected to PasswordRecovery stores passwords and recovers them when you forget them NCTextColor lets you add vibrancy to Notification Center iDownloadBlog           iDownloadblog.com About About Advertise Contact Keep in Touch Twitter Facebook RSS Feed Newsletter Push Notifications Podcasts Let's Talk iOS Let's Talk Jailbreak Site Stuff Disclosure Privacy Policy   Copyright iDownloadBlog 2016.

Such a system could work with existing car makers, according to Bloomberg. The new, smaller automotive team has until late next year to prove the concept of self-driving technology, sources said.

Follow TechnoBuffalo The Apple Car might not ever come to fruition. A report from Bloomberg on Monday details many of the headwinds Apple has faced during “Project Titan,” its in-house car project, and what will happen moving forward. Bloomberg detailed several flat tires that inhibited the project, from “strategy disagreements” to “leadership flux and supply chain challenges.” As a result, Apple cut more than 120 engineers earlier this year and has chosen to change its strategy from building an Apple Car that we’ll drive around, to building a platform for other automakers to build on. “It was an incredible failure of leadership,” one source told Bloomberg. The Apple Car isn’t going to happen The Apple Car, as we knew it, is dead. Apple’s bare-bones team will still work on building a self-driving platform for other manufacturers to use, though that’s already a crowded market. Volvo, Google, Uber and others are all racing to create similar solutions. As a result, even the fate of the platform team is up in the air. Bloomberg said Apple will ultimately decide by the end of 2017 whether or not that project will even move forward. This just goes to show that, despite Apple’s large pile of cash and success in other markets, the auto industry seems to be quite a different beast.

But now we know when the must-have sports gadget will be available - and it will go on sale Friday, October 28. Pick from two options including the 38mm case for £369 and the 42mm case for £399. You will be able to buy it from the Apple site but if you think the price is steep there is an option to pay monthly from £17.72 pm. It is specifically made for runners and you don't need to have your iPhone with you for it to work. It was showcased at the launch of the Apple Watch Series 2, at an event in San Francisco. And the Series 2 Watch went on sale September 16. The Nike+ edition has a different strap design and specialised software to help make it easier for people to put it on quickly. With built-in GPS and water resistant technology, for up to 50 metres, you can even take a dip in the pool after your run. The watch comes in four colour options including space grey with a black and yellow band, space grey with a black and grey band, silver aluminium with a silver and yellow band and silver with a silver and white band - all of which are bright and sporty looking. It will be powered by WatchOS: 3 software and you will be able to view your running history and directly launch the Nike+ running app from your watch. Instead of using your phone you will be able to track your progress on the watch, getting details on how far you've run and the time it has taken you. You can also share progress with friends and send virtual fist-bumps to one another, as well as check the weather, so there's no excuses not to pound the pavement. In order for the watch to work you will need an iPhone 5, 5c, 5s, SE, 6, 6 Plus, 6s, 6s Plus, 7 or 7 Plus, and iOS 10 or later. If you order online it will be dispatched within 3-4 weeks with free delivery.  Share More On Apple whats-on all Most Read Most Recent ArborfieldHollywood blockbusters could be filmed at Arborfield Garrison site Part of the old garrison could be transformed into a film studio ShoppingAmazon spreads Black Friday sales over 12 days - and it starts on Monday Black Friday will be here quicker than you expect ShoppingHere's how to save money on this year's Dream Toy Christmas list - including Hatchimal, LEGO, Shopkins and more Shop smart and get the must-have toys for less ReadingChildren in Need 2015: Where can I buy merchandise?

The digital music streaming service with the largest subscriber base slumps after Amazon.com beefs up its online platform. Rick Munarriz (TMFBreakerRick) Oct 17, 2016 at 9:08AM Image source: Pandora Media. Pandora Media (NYSE:P) investors have had their share of ups and downs this year. The stock seems to move higher when buyout buzz builds, retreating when fundamentals start to slip or a competitive threat emerges. The stock slumped 10.4% last week, so you can probably guess what happened. The big reason for last week's slide is Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) rolling out a new aggressively priced premium service. The world's leading online retailer debuted Amazon Music Unlimited on Wednesday. It's an on-demand service, similar to what has helped Spotify and Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) fast-growing Apple Music attract a combined 57 million paying subscribers. Amazon's new ad-free offering is priced at $9.99 a month, just like Spotify and Apple Music, but it's also available for just $7.99 a month to the tens of millions of Amazon Prime subscribers. Pandora isn't a player in the on-demand market. Folks can't pick out the exact songs that they want to hear on Pandora, at least not yet. Pandora selects tracks tethered to a user's preferences, and it's consumed mostly as a free ad-supported platform. However, it did roll out Pandora Plus last month, an ad-free music discovery experience for $4.99 a month. It's a step up from its original Pandora One service -- offering an offline listening component and more skips of undesired tracks -- but it's not in the same league as Spotify, Apple Music, and now Amazon Music Limited. Digital music's cutthroat ways Pandora's usage growth had stalled. There were 78.1 million active listeners at the end of June, fewer than the 79.4 million it was entertaining a year earlier. The bright side is that active listeners are consuming more content. Listener hours are up 7% over the past year, and the average user is streaming more than 24 hours a month.  However, with Apple Music and Spotify growing on the premium end -- attracting 17 million and 40 million paying subscribers, respectively -- it's clear that Pandora isn't toiling away in the digital music niche that's actually growing. That will change. Pandora has inked direct licensing deals with most of the important record labels, and it's widely expected to introduce an on-demand offering to take on Apple, Spotify, and now Amazon in the coming months.  The arrival of Amazon Music Unlimited with the online retailer presumably subsidizing the platform for its growing base of Prime subscribers will make things that much harder for Pandora to gain a foothold in the on-demand market early next year. Amazon's rollout also makes it less likely that will see Pandora's waning audience resume growing anytime soon. There is still hope for a turnaround, and the lower Pandora's stock gets, the more compelling it becomes to potential buyers. Pandora reportedly rebuffed a buyout offer at $15 a share earlier this summer, and with the stock now trading nearly 15% lower than that, we will probably see a new wave of takeout chatter if the shares continue to lose steam. That may provide a floor on the slide in the near term, but Pandora investors would probably feel a lot more comfortable if fundamentals would start to improve to the point where future gains would be more sustainable than speculative.    Rick Munarriz owns shares of Apple.

 There will never be an Apple Car Matthew DeBord Oct. 17, 2016, 9:26 AM 10,918 facebook linkedin twitter email print Nope. BI Screenshot/Motor Trend Channel After about two years of steady speculation, it now looks as if the mysterious Apple Car will never actually make it to the road. According to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman and Alex Webb, Apple "has drastically scaled back its automotive ambitions, leading to hundreds of job cuts and a new direction that, for now, no longer includes building its own car, according to people familiar with the project." Citing unnamed sources, Gurman and Webb also report that the "Project Titan" team is being dismantled and reorganized, with hundreds of departures and layoffs happening. They add that Project Titan has been "re-focused on developing an autonomous driving system that gives Apple flexibility to either partner with existing carmakers, or return to designing its own vehicle in the future" and that "executives have given the car team a deadline of late next year to prove the feasibility of the self-driving system and decide on a final direction." This news follows a period of negative information and rumors about the Apple Car this year. For example, The New York Times earlier reported dozens of layoffs on the project as part of a "reboot." (Gurman and Webb reported hundreds.) My colleague Steve Kovach has also covered two swerves on Project Titan — that Tim Cook made some obscure statements that suggest a recent investment in a Chinese car-sharing service is going to provide support, somehow, for the Apple Car, alleged to arrive in 2021, a rumor that now looks baseless. The second is that Apple also put somebody with zero automotive experience in charge of the project, although he was reportedly close to Steve Jobs. Having followed the nearly inconsequential progress of the mysterious Project Titan, I'm ready to say that if you insist on thinking Apple will be selling an actual car by the next decade, you're going to be disappointed. We were already being asked to accept some strange ideas, given Apple's alleged timetable. With the Apple Car project has underway for two years, it would somehow take the tech colossus seven years to create and market an automobile to meet what had once appeared to be Cook's expectations. That would have amounted to two entire product cycles for a major automaker. Heck, Ford designed, engineered, and went racing in about a year and half with the new $400,000 Ford GT supercar — and won the 24 Hours of Le Mans in June. Ford's Le Mans winner. Screenshot via Ford Performance If it was going to take Apple that long to bring a car to market, then we could only draw two conclusions: Apple wanted to develop a vehicle to use future technologies that aren't practical or accessible today, or Apple is completely incompetent when it comes to this car project. If Gurman and Webb's account in accurate, then at one time a contingent of Apple Car staffers had some pretty futuristic concepts in play; they would have added up to a fully autonomous electric vehicle that could replace the ignition key with a fingerprint and operate at the push of a single button. It now increasingly looks as though the Project Titan undertaking is just a sort of sideline experiment to keep pace with Google and Tesla — companies that are enduring their own struggles in the automotive front at the moment. It's unclear how Google will commercialize its self-driving technology, and Tesla is both attempting to merge with solar-panel installer SolarCity and meet a 2016 vehicle-delivery target of 80,000 to 90,000 cars. For what it's worth, I continue to think that the best plan for Apple is to develop a comprehensive automotive interface of some sort — a CarPlay that takes over your entire vehicle. CarPlay is very good, and, for me, it's become a welcome — if not quite indispensable — feature of modern automotive infotainment systems. So if Project Titan can achieve a CarPlay expansion or breakout, that would be wonderful. It would also avoid the easy quip that Project Titan has become Project Titanic, because a major infotainment advance would be welcomed by consumers who are frustrated with the complexity of their in-vehicle systems. But when it comes to an actual Apple Car, we're probably not talking about something with doors and wheels and an Apple badge on the front anymore.

 Apple envisioned using your fingerprint as a car key Kif Leswing Oct. 17, 2016, 9:32 AM 901 facebook linkedin twitter email print Business Insider Apple has been working on an electric, self-driving car since 2014, but nobody outside of the company knows what specific ideas and features the company had in mind. New details about what Apple had been working on were revealed in a Bloomberg report about how Apple's car project has been wracked by internal turmoil. Turns out, Apple had a few interesting ideas about what Apple could do with a car — starting with its Touch ID fingerprint technology.  "Apple executives had imagined an electric car that could recognize its driver by fingerprint and autonomously navigate with the press of a button," according to Bloomberg. "One plan sought a partially autonomous car that still had a steering wheel and pedals, while later plans migrated toward a fully autonomous vehicle." Touch ID is a fantastic example of how Apple's vertically integrated business model and computing technology could transition to the car. Put your finger on the sensor, and have your car take you to your destination. It's also worth noting that at least at the beginning, Apple did envision a "partially autonomous" car that the driver could control. Still, from the report, it sounds as if Apple has backed away from building its own automotive hardware in favor of self-driving software. So the fingerprint-unlocked car may be mothballed for now — but it remains a great example of how cars may transform when technology companies start building them.  SEE ALSO: One of Apple's most important technology partners is suffering a brain drain NOW WATCH: How the ‘perfect body’ for men has changed over the last 150 years Loading video...

autoevolution cars moto news car reviews spyshots driven cars newspaper green Compare Cars BAC Calculator   Editorial Coverstory Motorsport Testdrives archive Auto Shows Tuning Car Finder Photo of the Day Glossary of automotive terms Masthead RSS Feeds Apple's Titan Project Is Demoted to Self-Driving Software Only 17 Oct 2016, 13:13 UTC · by Vlad Mitrache / Home / News / Industry It's been two years since Apple first announced its ambitious foray into the world of car manufacturing, and all this time we haven't really seen any concrete proof of an actual Apple car. It has now become apparent that it wasn't because of Apple's excellent ability to keep things secret - even though the Californian company is doing its best with the unmarked labs and CIA-level secrecy - but because there was nothing to see. The Apple car never existed outside the tech giant's plans. A one-month-old report suggested that some of the Titan Project's employees have been laid off, but true to the private nature of the entire affair, their names have been kept secret. You sometimes get the impression that their families are being held at gunpoint by some Apple-hired hitmen. In reality, it probably all has to do with very strict contracts and the army of lawyers that Apple possesses. In early 2016, the project saw a leadership swap which brought with it a change in mentality as well. Gone are the plans to build an electric car from scratch, with the 1,000 people involved now working on developing an autonomous driving software. Given the delay, Apple is already behind in both directions, which means it will have to play a game it's not exactly used to: catching up. After having troubles with securing a supply chain and dealing with the low-income margins (compared to the tech business) of the automotive field, Apple had to take the decision to focus solely on the self-driving platform. What exactly the company plans to do with it once it's completed, is another matter. It's difficult to imagine Apple selling its product to other car makers, particularly since most of them are already working on similar technologies of their own. That means that when the time comes, Apple will have to partner with an automobile manufacturer. Given the awareness the fruity brand enjoys, it should have no problems finding suitors. However, you can imagine Apple being pretty strict on the quality of the products it puts its logo on, so that might prove more of a challenge. The Californian company may have experience with biting things, but it seems like this time it might have gone for more than it can chew. Breaking into the automotive industry isn't as easy as designing a car, but involves a lot of work and a very big investment. According to Bloomberg, the current deadline for what remains of the Titan Project is late last year, when the team is expected to deliver a feasibility test and the general direction that are to be followed. Whether the initial final term for 2020 still stands is unclear. apple car Titan project autonomous self-driving Apple   Why Apple and McLaren Should Probably Not Hook Up Infiniti's Variable Compression Engine - Why It's Important And How It Works Coolest OEM Rims Available On Production Cars What if Jaguar and Land Rover Weren't British Anymore?

Secret driverless vehicle takes a backseat Apple Car scrapped? Secret driverless vehicle takes a backseat by Sean Keach 17 October 2016 0 shares Read Comments The Apple Car may never see the light of day, as a new report describes how Apple has "drastically scaled back its automotive ambitions". Apple has decided to pull back on the development of its long-rumoured electric vehicle, according to Bloomberg. Apparently, the iPhone maker has now decided to refocus its efforts on developing an autonomous driving system, rather than taking on Tesla with an actual vehicle of its own. This shifting of priorities has reportedly led to hundreds of job cuts in the secretive Project Titan team. According to the report, Apple is keeping staff numbers "steady" by hiring new people to work on the driverless car system, following a lengthy spate of reassignments, redundancies and voluntary departures. It’s believed that Apple started designing its own driverless electric vehicle back in 2014, with the company embarking on an “aggressive hiring spree” to meet its purported 2020 launch goal. But Bloomberg remarks that Apple began to struggle early on: “By the end of 2015, the project was blighted by internal strife. Managers battled about the project’s direction, according to people with knowledge of the operations. ‘It was an incredible failure of leadership', one of the people said. In early 2016, project head Steve Zadesky, a former Ford Motor Co. engineer and early iPod designer, left Titan.” Zadesky was quickly replaced with Apple veteran Bob Mansfield, who quietly assumed charge of the Apple Car development. But as Bloomberg explains, Mansfield quickly shuttered hopes of a vehicle: “About a month later, Mansfield took the stage in a Silicon Valley auditorium packed with hundreds of Titan employees to announce the strategy shift, according to people who attended the meeting. Mansfield explained that he had examined the project and determined that Apple should move from building an outright competitor to Tesla Motors Inc. to an underlying self-driving platform.” According to the report, Apple has particularly struggled with automotive supply chains, which is no surprise. Former GM and BMW exec Bob Lutz was one of the more outspoken Apple Car sceptics, and was quoted in February last year as saying: “When it comes to actually making cars, there is no reason to assume that Apple, with no experience, will suddenly do a better job than General Motors, Ford, Volkswagen, Toyota or Hyundai. So I think this is going to be a gigantic money pit, but then it doesn’t matter. I mean Apple has an embarrassment of riches, they don’t know where to put the cash anymore. So if they burn 30 or 40 billion dollars in the car business, no-one’s going to notice.” Related: Death by Driverless Car He added: “If I were a shareholder I’d be very upset, because they’re currently engaged in a very high-margin business; and the automobile business, at best, is a very low-margin business. And you can’t show me one company in the world that, to date, has made a nickel on electric cars. There is absolutely no reason to assume that Apple is going to be financially successful in the electric car business.” Speaking to TrustedReviews at CES 2016, Dave Anderson, senior manager of Automotive Integration at Nvidia, said that Apple would find it challenging to build a car: “The longstanding tradition of making cars is something that is a significant learning curve, and even with a company that’s as sophisticated as Apple…that process still takes time.” But others were more hopeful, including Don Butler, Ford’s executive director for Connected Vehicles and Services, who told TrustedReviews earlier this year: “We welcome others joining. We welcome the activity that’s in the space. We think it’s exciting. It’s actually chang that we are embracing. So I think Apple can do it. I think Google can do it." Bloomberg reports that Apple is trying to make sure it has the flexibility to return to designing its own vehicle in the future, but that the driverless car system is the focus for now.

October 17 AAPL: 117.55 -0.08 KGI: Apple to benefit from Samsung Note 7 recall/cancellation, estimated 5-7 million users to switch to iPhone 7 Benjamin Mayo - 4 weeks ago @bzamayo iPhone 7 View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Apple appears to the be the primary beneficiary of the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 recall blunders, with replacement devices also prone to catching fire which eventually resulted in the company cancelling production of the Note 7 entirely. This means Note 7 customers have no choice but to choose another type of phone. Obviously, Samsung hopes customers will flock to one of its other phones (like the Galaxy S7) but a report from KGI believes that Apple and Android manufacturer Huawei will be the biggest benefactors. Ming-Chi Kuo estimates that 5-7 million ex-Note 7 orders will convert into iPhone 7 sales, predominantly iPhone 7 Plus thanks to the dual camera. KGI says Note 7 users will have lost faith in the Samsung brand and have a tendency to like iOS and camera features, making the new iPhone an attractive sale. The report explains that this intersection of users have shown little loyalty to a particular manufacturer and will be easily swayed to make the jump to iOS with many having previous experience with iPhone devices. Obviously, this is largely speculative as it is hard to predict how customers will react. Some Note 7 owners are refusing to even return their current devices, due to exclusive features like iris biometrics detection. That being said, Apple is well positioned to capture this market. Out of approximately 12 million Note 7 orders, KGI claims Apple will be able to reap about 50% of the customers with the rest being shared amongst Android manufacturers like Huawei. It is also worth noting that the ‘Google Phone’, the new Pixel, is currently out of stock and a very good choice for ex-Samsung customers. AAPL company stock has steadily risen in the past month, with some of the increase accountable to the catastrophic launch of the Samsung Note 7. KGI says that the impact of the Note 7 failings will not be protracted beyond a couple of months but warns another round of similar faults would destroy the Samsung brand as a top-of-the-line phone manufacturer. Apple should see upside in the fourth quarter of 2016 as well as early 2017. The iPhone maker will report earnings results to investors next week on October 25, which includes initial round of iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus sales. Investors have become more bullish about iPhone 7 sales as time has gone on although many are still not expecting a record revenue quarter for Apple.

For me it was more than eight years ago, but I can remember the exact date: January 15th, 2008. Late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs was on stage delivering a keynote at the 2008 Macworld conference, and he pulled a shockingly thin all-aluminum laptop out of a manila envelope to give the world its first ever look at the MacBook Air. It was nothing short of remarkable, and Apple’s rivals have been chasing it ever since. I’m not yet convinced that the new Yoga Book will have the same dramatic impact on the laptop computer market. Still, the day I first set eyes on Lenovo’s new hybrid device marked the first time since January 2008 that I felt I was looking at a truly innovative laptop. Lenovo first unveiled the Yoga Book in late August ahead of the annual IFA trade show in Berlin, Germany, but I had spent some time with the device a month earlier when I previewed all of Lenovo’s IFA announcements. There was plenty to take in at that meeting, but Lenovo saved the Yoga Book for last because it was clearly the most intriguing new product in the company’s holiday lineup. I have now been using a review unit for the past week, and I’ll share my experience in this post. yoga-book-1More First of all, what’s so special about the Yoga Book? In a market flush with "hybrid" devices that combine the portability of a tablet with the versatility of a laptop, the Yoga Book is an entirely new breed of device. It still fits into the hybrid category, but just barely. While a conventional hybrid combines the form factor and functionality of two devices — a laptop and a tablet — the Yoga Book combines three different devices. Maybe we should call it a "tribrid." On second thought, maybe we shouldn’t. In addition to offering the clamshell form factor of a laptop and the touchscreen experience of a tablet, the Yoga Book also sports a pen tablet, commonly referred to as a digitizer tablet or a graphics tablet. The pen tablet occupies the same physical space as the keyboard, so the device is actually two tablets joined by a unique "watchband hinge" that sandwiches them together when closed, or places them back-to-back when rotated all the way open. Using the digitizing pad and included "Real Pen" stylus, the Yoga Book is a full featured pen tablet. You can write or draw anywhere on the surface and your strokes will be recorded and displayed on the display above. The device uses Wacom Feel technology, which supports 2,048 levels of pressure as well as 100 degrees of angle detection. As an added bonus, the Real Pen can also use an actual pen nib and you can place a pad of paper on top of the digitizer. Then, as you write or draw in real ink on real paper, your strokes are also recorded and digitized by the Yoga Book. With the quick press of a touch-sensitive button near the top of the digitizing pad, the Yoga Book’s "Halo Keyboard" is illuminated. The glowing buttons look just like the keypad on old Motorola RAZR phones, but in this case it’s a full QWERTY keyboard with a trackpad. yoga-book-4More Typing on the Halo Keyboard is nothing like typing on a typical laptop keyboard for obvious reasons — it’s a capacitive surface that recognizes touch input, not actual keys as you would find on a conventional keyboard. The device does offer feedback in the form of haptic vibrations and the typical tap sounds found in Windows 10, though you can disable either or both if you so choose. I personally like the vibration feedback, though I wish the vibration intensity was adjustable. Each vibration is actually so loud that it could easily disturb people around in a quiet room. Read More Think of the Halo Keyboard as being akin to Microsoft’s Touch Cover on its Surface tablets. It’s not quite as good as typing on a "real" keyboard, but it’s far better than typing on a virtual keyboard on a tablet’s display. It also allowed Lenovo to create a device that is far lighter than a conventional hybrid; the Yoga Book weighs just 1.5 pounds, which is less than a full-size iPad Pro that doesn’t even have a keyboard. To quickly cover some other important specs, the Yoga Book features a 2.4GHz Intel Atom x5-Z8550 processor, Intel HD 400 graphics, 4GB of LPDDR3 RAM, a 10.1-inch 1080p display, 64GB of internal storage as well as microSDXC support, an 8-megapixel rear camera, a 2-megapixel front-facing camera, Wi-Fi AC, cellular support and an 8,500 mAh battery that Lenovo says will carry you through a full day of usage on a single charge (and I indeed found that to be the case). In the end, I found that I had a much easier time using the Yoga Book than I thought I would. My review unit ran Windows 10 — Lenovo also offers an Android version with the exact same specs — and I used the device to write this very article. Typing on the Yoga Book takes a bit of getting used to, as is the case with Microsoft’s Surface tablets and Touch Cover keyboards. But once I got comfortable with the Halo Keyboard, I found that I typed much more quickly than I do on a typical tablet display. yoga-book-3More I’m no artist, but I also had a great experience using the pen tablet with Lenovo’s stylus. The pen tablet is very sensitive, as you would expect from any device equipped with Wacom tech. I also like taking notes by hand from time to time, so the ability to place a pad on the pen tablet and have it digitize my handwriting was great. Of note, switching between the stylus tip and an actual pen cartridge is fast and easy. The cap of the stylus has a built-in removal tool and the stylus takes standard ink cartridges that can be purchased on Amazon or in any office supply store. At $499.99 for the Android version and $549.99 for the Windows 10 model, the Yoga Book is priced in line with tablets. It is a tablet, but it’s also so much more. I’m not sure this is or will ever be a mass-market device like Apple’s MacBook Air, but in my eyes it’s just as innovative as the Air, provided the user has a genuine need for a hybrid device with professional-grade pen support. Both new Yoga Book models go on sale beginning Monday, October 17th on the Lenovo online store.

The digital music streaming service with the largest subscriber base slumps after Amazon.com beefs up its online platform. Rick Munarriz (TMFBreakerRick) Oct 17, 2016 at 9:08AM Image source: Pandora Media. Pandora Media (NYSE:P) investors have had their share of ups and downs this year. The stock seems to move higher when buyout buzz builds, retreating when fundamentals start to slip or a competitive threat emerges. The stock slumped 10.4% last week, so you can probably guess what happened. The big reason for last week's slide is Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) rolling out a new aggressively priced premium service. The world's leading online retailer debuted Amazon Music Unlimited on Wednesday. It's an on-demand service, similar to what has helped Spotify and Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) fast-growing Apple Music attract a combined 57 million paying subscribers. Amazon's new ad-free offering is priced at $9.99 a month, just like Spotify and Apple Music, but it's also available for just $7.99 a month to the tens of millions of Amazon Prime subscribers. Pandora isn't a player in the on-demand market. Folks can't pick out the exact songs that they want to hear on Pandora, at least not yet. Pandora selects tracks tethered to a user's preferences, and it's consumed mostly as a free ad-supported platform. However, it did roll out Pandora Plus last month, an ad-free music discovery experience for $4.99 a month. It's a step up from its original Pandora One service -- offering an offline listening component and more skips of undesired tracks -- but it's not in the same league as Spotify, Apple Music, and now Amazon Music Limited. Digital music's cutthroat ways Pandora's usage growth had stalled. There were 78.1 million active listeners at the end of June, fewer than the 79.4 million it was entertaining a year earlier. The bright side is that active listeners are consuming more content. Listener hours are up 7% over the past year, and the average user is streaming more than 24 hours a month.  However, with Apple Music and Spotify growing on the premium end -- attracting 17 million and 40 million paying subscribers, respectively -- it's clear that Pandora isn't toiling away in the digital music niche that's actually growing. That will change. Pandora has inked direct licensing deals with most of the important record labels, and it's widely expected to introduce an on-demand offering to take on Apple, Spotify, and now Amazon in the coming months.  The arrival of Amazon Music Unlimited with the online retailer presumably subsidizing the platform for its growing base of Prime subscribers will make things that much harder for Pandora to gain a foothold in the on-demand market early next year. Amazon's rollout also makes it less likely that will see Pandora's waning audience resume growing anytime soon. There is still hope for a turnaround, and the lower Pandora's stock gets, the more compelling it becomes to potential buyers. Pandora reportedly rebuffed a buyout offer at $15 a share earlier this summer, and with the stock now trading nearly 15% lower than that, we will probably see a new wave of takeout chatter if the shares continue to lose steam. That may provide a floor on the slide in the near term, but Pandora investors would probably feel a lot more comfortable if fundamentals would start to improve to the point where future gains would be more sustainable than speculative.    Rick Munarriz owns shares of Apple.

Daily Deals: Amazon Echo $120, 23-inch HP display $87, and more   skip to main content skip to main menu     Bloomberg: Apple gives up building a car, for now By Christian Zibreg, Oct 17, 2016 Tweet 13 Comments Project Titan, Apple’s ambitious initiative to build an electric vehicle by 2020–2021 reportedly fell apart amid management crisis, supply chain issues and departures, prompting the company’s leadership to shift gears and focus on autonomous self-driving software, for now. Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman reported Monday that Apple will decide fate of self-driving software by late 2017 as the new direction no longer includes building its own car. Bloomberg says that the change of plans and a tentative 2017 deadline for self-driving software came after months of strategy disagreements, leadership flux and supply chain challenges inside Apple’s unmarked car labs in Sunnyvale, California. Apple had originally envisioned an electric car that could recognize a driver by fingerprint and autonomously navigate with the press of a button, Bloomberg writes. “One plan sought a partially autonomous car that still had a steering wheel and pedals, while later plans migrated toward a fully autonomous vehicle,” reads the report. The change in direction led to job cuts as hundreds of members of the 1,000-people strong Project Titan team have been reassigned, let go or have left of their own volition in two rounds of job cuts, one in August and the other in September. More than 120 software engineers working on a car operating system and testing procedures were let go, including their lead John Wright and Dan Dodge, who created BlackBerry-owned QNX car software that powers CarPlay. A few hundred hardware engineers working on car chassis, suspensions and undercarriages also lost their jobs. From the article: New leadership of the initiative, known internally as Project Titan, has re-focused on developing an autonomous driving system that gives Apple flexibility to either partner with existing carmakers, or return to designing its own vehicle in the future, the people also said. Apple has kept staff numbers in the team steady by hiring people to help with the new focus, according to another person. Remaining engineers are now working on autonomous programs, vision sensors and simulators for testing Apple’s platform in real-world environments. Another excerpt: By the end of 2015, the project was blighted by internal strife. Managers battled about the project’s direction, according to people with knowledge of the operations. “It was an incredible failure of leadership,” one of the people said. In early 2016, project head Steve Zadesky, a former Ford Motor Co. engineer and early iPod designer, left Titan. Zadesky, who remains at Apple, declined to comment. Apple’s hardware expert Bob Mansfield was un-retired in April to lead Project Titan team. After carefully examining the project Mansfield announced a strategy shift to the team, saying Apple should “move from building an outright competitor to Tesla Motors Inc. to an underlying self-driving platform.” Source: Bloomberg Share: Tweet Follow: Follow @iDownloadBlog We Recommend Small Korean firm rumored to co-develop advanced hollow batteries for Project Titan Bloomberg: Apple’s Project Titan prioritizes autonomous driving amid new hirings Here are Gene Munster’s latest musings on Project Titan & Apple VR headset WSJ: Apple’s retired hardware chief Bob Mansfield to oversee development of Project Titan Related Topics Apple, Apple Car, Automotive, Bloomberg, Car, iCar, News, Rumors Dean Flory Lead or follow Apple.

 Apple has given up building a car — for now Sam Shead Oct. 17, 2016, 8:35 AM 5,385 facebook linkedin twitter email print Business Insider Apple has temporarily put its plans to build a car on hold, according to Bloomberg journalists Mark Gurman and Alex Webb, who cite numerous people familiar with the matter. Over recent months, "hundreds" of people on a 1,000-strong Apple car team have been reassigned or let go or have left the company of their own accord, Bloomberg's sources said. Apple has reportedly let go of more than 120 automotive software engineers, while several hundred employees who were working on the car chassis, suspension, and undercarriages have also departed. Though Apple is no longer looking to develop its own automobile, it is still interested in developing an autonomous driving system that could be sold to car manufacturers or integrated into an Apple car down the line, according to the report. Those remaining on the Apple car team — created in 2014 and said to be known internally as "Project Titan" — have reportedly been given a year to prove the feasibility of the self-driving system. Under Project Titan, the company's executives dreamed of building an electric car that would be able to recognise its driver by fingerprint and autonomously drive the person from A to B at the touch of a button, according to Bloomberg. Apple was initially hoping to start shipping the Apple car in 2019, according to a report from The Wall Street Journal in September of last year. An Apple concept car designed by Aristomenis Tsirbas, a contestant in a design contest sponsored by Freelancer.com.Aristomenis Tsirbas/Freelancer.com Apple has never publicly said it is working on a car, but the company has recruited dozens of automotive experts from companies like Ford and Mercedes-Benz, according to the Financial Times. There was a time when both former Ford engineer Steve Zadesky, who helped build the iPhone, and Johann Jungwirth, who was Mercedes Benz's research-and-development chief, were working for Apple. Bloomberg reports that the shift in direction comes after months of upheaval within Apple's secret car labs in Sunnyvale, California, which are less than 5 miles from the company's headquarters in Cupertino. Bloomberg specifically cites "strategy disagreements, leadership flux and supply chain challenges." In April, a local news report from Frankfurter Allgemeine suggested that Apple was also using a team of engineers in Berlin to develop the Apple car. Silicon Valley heavyweights like Google and Uber are carrying out their own research into autonomous cars, as are many of the traditional car manufacturers, including BMW, Daimler, and Volkswagen. Apple did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment. NOW WATCH: A hacker reveals a simple way to come up with a strong password that's easy to remember Loading video...

By Mark Gurman and Alex Webb. Added by Agency Staff on 17 October 2016. Saved under Editor's pick, World Tags: Apple, Bob Mansfield, Ford, Tesla, Tesla Motors, Tim Cook Tweet Image: Tsahi Levent-Levi Apple has drastically scaled back its automotive ambitions, leading to hundreds of job cuts and a new direction that, for now, no longer includes building its own car, according to people familiar with the project. Hundreds of members of the car team, which comprises about a thousand people, have been reassigned, let go, or have left of their own volition in recent months, the people said, asking not to be identified because the moves aren’t public. New leadership of the initiative, known internally as Project Titan, has refocused on developing an autonomous driving system that gives Apple flexibility to either partner with existing car makers, or return to designing its own vehicle in the future, the people also said. Apple has kept staff numbers in the team steady by hiring people to help with the new focus, according to another person. Apple executives have given the car team a deadline of late next year to prove the feasibility of the self-driving system and decide on a final direction, two of the people said. Apple spokesman Tom Neumayr declined to comment. The new shift and deadline come after months of strategy disagreements, leadership flux and supply chain challenges inside Apple’s unmarked car labs in Sunnyvale, California, a short drive from its Cupertino headquarters. Apple isn’t the first to realise mastery of mobile gadgets and software updates is no guarantee of automotive success. Google learnt the challenges of building its own vehicles and has sought partners. Its car project has also suffered departures. Tech investors are dubious, too. They’re used to fat profit margins, while car makers survive on net margins well below 10%. “For a quality Apple-branded car, they could probably get a healthy margin,” said Eric Paul Dennis, an analyst at the Centre for Automotive Research. “They probably weren’t willing to compromise on quality issues” because that could hurt the perception of its other products, he added. The car is the ultimate mobile device, isn’t it? Apple started Titan in 2014 with grand ambitions to make a dent in an auto industry that consultant McKinsey & Co estimates will be worth US$6,7 trillion by 2030. The iPhone maker embarked upon an aggressive hiring spree, and an Apple-designed vehicle was targeted by the early 2020s. The hope was to revolutionise cars in the way the iPhone upended the mobile industry in 2007. By the end of 2015, the project was blighted by internal strife. Managers battled about the project’s direction, according to people with knowledge of the operations. “It was an incredible failure of leadership,” one of the people said. In early 2016, project head Steve Zadesky, a former Ford engineer and early iPod designer, left Titan. Zadesky, who remains at Apple, declined to comment. Zadesky handed the reins to his boss, Dan Riccio, adding to responsibilities that already included engineering annual iPhone, iPad and Mac refreshes. Bob Mansfield, a highly regarded manager who helped develop the original iPad, returned in April from a part-time role at Apple to lead the team. About a month later, Mansfield took the stage in a Silicon Valley auditorium packed with hundreds of Titan employees to announce the strategy shift, according to people who attended the meeting. Mansfield explained that he had examined the project and determined that Apple should move from building an outright competitor to Tesla Motors to an underlying self-driving platform. In the following months, engineers started leaving. Some chose to quit amid doubts over job security and scepticism that an Apple car product would ever come to market. Others were cut. In August, a first wave of employees was let go, followed by a second round in September. More than 120 software engineers working on a car operating system and testing procedures were cut. Several hundred hardware engineers working on car chassis, suspensions and undercarriages also left, the people said. The New York Times reported in September that Apple had cut dozens of employees from Titan. Apple CEO Tim Cook John Wright, a veteran Apple manager who led the software teams, has left the project, according to people familiar with the matter. Dan Dodge, creator of BlackBerry’s QNX car software, took a larger role developing Apple’s auto platform architecture, some of those people said. Remaining software engineers are working on autonomous programs, vision sensors and simulators for testing the platform in real-world environments. The team also has regulatory specialists to navigate the heavily regulated auto industry, one of the people said. It’s a far cry from early plans that excited Apple executives. “The car is the ultimate mobile device, isn’t it?” chief operating officer Jeff Williams said in 2015. Soon after, CEO Tim Cook said the auto industry was “at an inflection point for massive change”. Fully autonomous Apple executives had imagined an electric car that could recognise its driver by fingerprint and autonomously navigate with the press of a button. One plan sought a partially autonomous car that still had a steering wheel and pedals, while later plans migrated toward a fully autonomous vehicle. Regardless of Apple’s struggles, established car makers have recognised the threat posed by new entrants and have embarked on a hiring and acquisition splurge to beef up their software capabilities. They are wary of allowing technology companies to own the lucrative software component of new cars. Apple, meanwhile, struggled to tackle complex automotive supply chains, according to another person familiar with the situation. In smartphones, Apple wields extensive influence and often secures exclusive rights to certain parts from suppliers. For cars, the heavy investment required to make automotive parts means suppliers are less willing to commit their products to a vehicle like Apple’s which may have initially shipped in small quantities. “When they started digging into the details of what that would entail, it likely became an intractable problem,” the Centre for Automotive Research’s Dennis said.  — (c) 2016 Bloomberg LP Share this article Tweet Connect with TechCentral Follow TechCentral on Twitter Connect with TechCentral on Facebook Connect with TechCentral on Google+ Subscribe to our newsletter Articles by comments (7 days) 19Why Eskom’s nuclear plan is toxic 13Social media analysis pointing to Trump upset 9Brian Molefe quits as Eskom CEO 9New ICT BEE code comes into force 8Trouble brewing in Android land Home About Advertise Newsletter Contact RSS ↑ TechCentral TechCentral Log in - (c) 2009 - 2015 NewsCentral Media

Will the iPhone 8 come with an AI-assisted boost to battery life? by Joe Roberts 17 October 2016 0 shares Read Comments This year saw the the launch of what might just be the most underwhelming Apple handset ever, with the iPhone 7's minimal design improvements failing to impress many fans. And while the phone's unexciting debut seems not to have damaged its popularity, its abysmal battery life made it the first iPhone we at TrustedReviews have not recommended. But we're holding out hope that next year's iPhone installment, likely to be the iPhone 8, will bring the design overhaul and new features we've been waiting for, with patents and rumours suggesting Apple will opt for a bezel-less full-face screen. Related: iPhone 7 The iPhone 7 And it seems, along with the new design, we might see some novel AI-based features arrive with the iPhone 8, if Tim Cook's latest statements are anything to go by. The Apple CEO spoke to Japanese site Nikkei during a trip to the country to open new a research and development facility in Yokohama. Hinting at possible future innovations, Cook told the site that the new facility would be woking on developing "deep engineering" for its AI systems, saying AI "is horizontal in nature, running across all products". Perhaps most interesting, however, was his comment that Apple wants "the AI to increase your battery life," hinting that future iPhones could come with some form of AI-assisted battery saving features. And while further details are, of course, non-existent at this time, we're hoping Apple figures out how to implement such a feature very soon, if only to make up for the iPhone 7's poor battery performance. The only further information Cook provided was that the company also has ambitions to make an AI that will "help you remember where you parked your car." With Google making big developments in AI, most notably with its DeepMind division which produced the artificial inteligence system that beat a Go world champion this year, and Microsoft restructuring to create a new AI division, Apple will face a lot of competition when it comes to artificial intelligence. But we're excited to see what comes out of its research in the near future, beyond an iPhone with a decent battery life.

My primary phone, for all intends and purposes, is one that runs Android OS. And it is not the OnePlus 3. Also Read: OnePlus 3 review: Flagship killer that will make you want to settle Now that we have that out of our way, let's jump straight to what this piece is all about. It's about how the best of Apple, which in this case is the iPhone 7 (and the iPhone 7 Plus), and one of the best Android phones -- the OnePlus 3 -- compare. Before we dive deep, it is rather easy to see how this comparison is going to play out. The iPhone 7 (and the iPhone 7 Plus) is a fantastic phone. But the OnePlus 3 is  almost equally good and a much better -- no read it as unbeatable -- value for money. It is one hell of a phone for Rs 27,999 and it matches the latest iPhones in a way that is commendable. iPhone 7 is bright but where are the pixels? Apple (still) loves smaller iPhones, because well, people (still) love smaller iPhones. The very existence of the iPhone SE was (is) based on this observation, although I am not sure how many people are still buying the iPhone SE. The iPhone 7 (similarly) is still a 4.7-inch phone like its predecessor iPhone 6S. Now, I am not against smaller phones. I love smaller phones. But 4.7-inch is a little too small, especially in 2016, when 4G and streaming services seem to be the only buzz word. A 5-inch phone still makes a lot of sense, but 4.7-inch is not what you can call ideal. Of course, if you're someone who liked the 4-inch iPhone SE, this argument holds no ground. If you're someone who liked last year's iPhone 6S, again, this argument should hold no ground. Provided, you're someone who now wants a bigger screen because well, you want to do more on your phone for which more real estate is essential. For those of you looking for a bigger option, Apple has you covered with the 5.5-inch iPhone 7 Plus. Remember, it will cost you more but then again someone who is already invested in the idea of an iPhone (and iOS) wouldn't mind spending a little extra cash to get their hands on a bigger iPhone that also has two cameras and a bigger battery in comparison. Size isn't the only problem that the iPhone 7 ships with though. It's the screen resolution that keeps you asking for more. Even though the screen of the iPhone 7 is extremely bright and shows accurate colours down to the t, it can only boast of a display resolution of 750x1334 pixels which roughly translates to 326 ppi pixel density. At the same time, Apple has moved the white point of the display in the iPhone 7 to a more neutral 6600K which means that it is more pleasing and less straining to the eyes. The latter part applies to the bigger iPhone 7 Plus as well. Both these factors have long-term implications. A 750p display (no matter how bright and accurate) is simply no match for a 1080p screen (the one that the larger iPhone 7 Plus ships with) and just because the iPhone 7 has significantly lower pixel density (than the iPhone 7 Plus) means it is far less ideal for virtual reality scenarios. Even 1080p display is considered less than ideal -- ideally, the screen should be at least 2K -- but 1080p is always better than 750p. Just like Google which is using a 1080p display in the Pixel (and a 2K screen in the Pixel XL), it seems Apple also wants only its larger iPhone 7 Plus to be cream of the crop as far as VR is concerned. If you want to do VR, well, you need to spend more money. It's only that way or the highway, so it seems. Users can, however, contend with the lack of formidable VR experiences on the iPhone 7 (and the Google Pixel similarly) but the fact that Apple has moved the white point to a more neutral setting in the iPhone 7 (and the iPhone 7 Plus) also means some users may find it too yellowish (warm) compared to the more bluish screen of the previous iPhones. The difference is more pronounced if you're someone who has used an Android phone with an AMOLED display. You know those screens with notorious deep blacks. The OnePlus 3 comes with a 5.5-inch 1080p Optic AMOLED display and a 401 ppi pixel density. It's every bit as bright and punchy, if not the most accurate sometimes. iOS 10 is cool, but it's still very limitingiOS 10 is perhaps the biggest (and most well-thought-out) update ever to Apple's iOS. It's fantastic. I like the new lock screen and how Apple (finally) gives users access to a lot more widgets. I like how emojis form an integral part of communication now and how Siri is being opened to third-party developers after all this time. It all adds up you know, the bits and pieces, to form the bigger picture. iOS 10 is cool, but you can't help but notice, it's still very limiting. There is still only so much that you can do, apart from what Apple wants you to do on an iPhone. The OnePlus 3, on the other hand, runs Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow-based OxygenOS version 3.1.2. OxygenOS sticks dangerously close to stock Android and offers an almost bloat-free experience out-of-the-box. The only extra apps it chips in is a file manager, gallery and a music player. Think of it as a third-party Nexus (now Pixel). Even though OxygenOS stays true to Google's OS most of the times, it has added a few in-house features that although more a novelty, are useful nonetheless. Key among them is Shelf, a home screen that holds all your recent apps, quick contacts, custom widgets, memos and reminders, all in one place. A system wide Dark theme, manual Night mode and gesture support are other notable inclusions. Being close to stock Android means, key Marshmallow takeaways like Doze, improved RAM management and app permissions come baked into the software. Moreover, Android Nougat will bring in a few more, more importantly, multi-tasking and dual window support among other things. And just because, there is minimum third-party skinning involved, things are bound to stay smooth and seamless for a very long time on the OnePlus 3 (as compared to other Android phones that involve additional skinning). Additionally, the OnePlus 3 also offers an unlocked bootloader. This means you can root it, ROM it as and when you like and it won't void the phone's warranty. That's like a geek paradise, to say the least. iPhone 7 doesn't have a headphone jack, and that makes me sadThe iPhone 7 does not have a 3.5mm audio jack. Alas! Instead, the phone comes with a single connectivity (lightning) port for charging, data syncing and audio out. The company has designed wireless EarPods called AirPods for the new iPhones. For those of you looking to connect your regular 3.5mm headphones to them, you get a lightning to 3.5mm adapter inside the box. Regular Bluetooth headphones should work fine with the new iPhones though. The AirPods (including charging case) will be available for Rs 15,400 in India. Meanwhile, Apple will include EarPods with Lightning Connector and a Lightning to 3.5 mm Headphone Jack Adapter inside the box. The iPhone 7 doesn't have a headphone jack, and that makes me sad because I own a few really cool wired headphones. I can't use them with the iPhone 7. Well I can, but, I will need to carry a dongle with me everywhere I go. The EarPods with Lightning Connector that Apple ships in the box are just bad (like previous EarPods) and those AirPods are mighty expensive and also mighty ugly. Not to mention, I am bound to lose them. I can use my Bluetooth headphones, sure, but at the end of the day, all this is so -- for the lack of a better word -- taxing. You know, not everyone has the luxury of owning both wired and wireless headphone (s) to choose from, for convenience purposes. Not everyone would want to carry a separate dongle in support of Apple's courageous act. Not everyone would want to pay Rs 15,400 to get a hold of those wireless AirPods either. But maybe Apple thinks if someone can afford to buy its iPhone, the person can and will buy everything that comes along. It's a package deal, the iPhone 7. I love the new stereo speakers though. They are out of this world really. People who buy iPhone 7 will never know what Dash Charging is all aboutThe iPhone 7 is backed by a 1,960 mAh battery and Apple claims that it has the longest battery life ever in an iPhone which is true. Battery life of the new iPhone 7 is better than the battery life of the iPhone 6S before it, but only marginally. It will depend on how you use your device, obviously, but most users with a more generalised usage pattern should get close to one full working day's battery life out of the iPhone 7. If however, you're looking for a bigger battery (and a better battery life) the iPhone 7 Plus (with a 2,900mAh battery) will get the job done. It's actaully quite good at that. The OnePlus 3 meanwhile backed by a 3,000mAh battery. The OnePlus 3 has decent battery life (above-average), if not the best. It is still better than the iPhone 7 though, but only marginally. But while the OnePlus 3 supports fast charging, the iPhone 7 doesn't. The OnePlus 3 is OnePlus' first phone that supports its in-house fast charging technology -- or fast charge in general -- called Dash Charging. The accompanying Dash Charger is capable of charging the phone to up to 60 per cent in just 30 minutes. And it does. 45 minutes or so is all it takes to fully charge the phone. Moreover, the Dash charger has been built in a way that shifts most of the power management processes from the phone to itself so the phone doesn't get hot while charging. And it doesn't. The OnePlus 3 stays surprisingly cool even when charging. This means you can continue to use the phone even while it's charging. OnePlus 3 costs half as much the iPhone 7. It's not a bad deal, I say!The iPhone 7 starts at Rs 60,000 for the base 32GB version and goes all the way up to Rs 80,000 for the top-end 256GB model. The iPhone 7 Plus starts at Rs 72,000 and goes all the way up to Rs 92,000. The OnePlus 3 6GB RAM and 64GB memory variant meanwhile has been priced at Rs 27,999. But OnePlus 3 is no iPhone. So they sayAs Apple used to put it back in the day, "If you don't have an iPhone, well you don't have an iPhone" and quite rightly so, it doesn't get any better than the iPhone 7 if you absolutely have to have the best. The iPhone 7 broadly focuses on durability, photography and audio aspects. It is the first iPhone ever to come with IP67 certification for water and dust resistance. It is the first (smaller) iPhone ever to come with optical image stabilisation. And it is the first iPhone ever to come with stereo speakers. Performance, as expected, is top-notch. Its cameras are just fantastic. And iOS is clearly headed in the right direction. But don't forget, the OnePlus 3 is no slouch either. Thanks to Qualcomm's top-tier Snapdragon 820 processor clubbed with 6 gigs of RAM, and software that is as close as it gets to stock Android, the OnePlus 3, scored an impressive 8.5 in our review. The OnePlus 3 is one of those rare case studies where it's hard to find a catch, simply because there isn't any. It's not perfect, but hey, the iPhone 7 isn't perfect either as is evident from the above observations. What's important is that Android is finally catching up. It's catching up pretty fast and some of these phones are doing that at half the cost. That's something to ponder over. Peace!

In case it stops working, a quick fix will be implemented until repairs are made.  ( iwayne | MacRumors ) Advertisement Apple made a lot of changes and improvements to the iPhone 7, with perhaps the most discussed variation being the removal of the headphone jack. One other major change that Apple implemented with the iPhone 7 is the new home button. Previously a physical button that users can press, the home button in the company's latest flagship smartphone has been changed into a non-physical, solid state pressure sensitive button that sits on the surface of the device. In a post made on the MacRumors forum, user iwayne revealed that the new iPhone 7 home button comes with a quick workaround, as implemented by Apple, in case it stops working. In an image of the iPhone 7 lock screen that he uploaded, a message stating that the home button may require service is shown, which apparently pops up if the smartphone's system detects something wrong. The quick workaround is that, if such a problem is detected, an onscreen home button is automatically shown on the smartphone's screen, allowing iPhone 7 owners to keep using their smartphone until they get the home button repaired. The onscreen home button itself is not a new feature for the iPhone, as it can be activated through the Accessibility options of the iOS. Tapping on it reveals a variety of functions to users, and it can be dragged to any point of the screen. Apple made the decision to replace the physical home button with a non-physical one because without any mechanical parts, the new home button for the iPhone 7 has less chances of failing compared with the home buttons of previous iPhones. In addition, with no physical home button, the iPhone 7 was able to achieve an IP67 waterproof rating. The instant activation of the onscreen home button in case of failure presents another advantage that the new home button has over the old one, as users are provided that extra confidence in making the most out of their iPhone 7. One disadvantage that a non-physical home button has, however, is that the user needs to create skin contact with his or her fingers to activate it. This would become a problem in instances when the user is wearing gloves, which is a necessity during the cold months of winter. The replacement of the physical home button for the iPhone 7 is rumored to be a sign of an even bigger change coming to Apple's flagship product, and that is the removal of the home button altogether.

By Alistair Charlton October 17, 2016 13:38 BST Once thought to be much more advanced than CarPlay (pictured), Apple's car project is now software-onlyApple After hundreds of job cuts and a significant scaling back of operations, Apple is no longer planning to build its own car. Instead, the iPhone maker will refocus its secretive automotive division on the burgeoning autonomous software industry. People familiar with Project Titan – as the vehicle was known internally – have said hundreds of the thousand-strong team of engineers working on it have been laid off, or moved to other parts of the business. Speaking to Bloomberg, the same insiders have said Apple is now working on developing autonomous driving software, giving the company the flexibility to either partner with an existing carmaker (like Google has with Fiat Chrysler and Uber with Volvo), or return to creating its own car at a later date. After the widespread culling, Apple is now working to keep staff numbers at the scaled-down Project Titan department stable, the people said. New hires are being made, but only if they fit the new direction that the company is taking. Sources claim that Apple executives have given the team behind Project Titan, led by former executive Bob Mansfield, a deadline of late 2017 to prove the feasibility of the self-driving system they are creating. Then, Apple bosses will make a final decision on the fate and ultimate direction of Project Titan. The changes, Bloomberg claims, come after months of disagreements over strategy, changes in leadership, down scaling and supply chain issues within Apple's secret car labs, located in Sunnyvale and a short drive from the main campus at Cupertino, California. History of Project Titan Project Titan kicked off in 2014 and quickly grew to a team of more than 1,000 employees. It is understood Apple was planning to produce its own electric vehicle to compete with Tesla. The car was intended to launch at the end of the decade with partial autonomy, then if a commercial success it would be followed by a fully autonomous car sometime after 2020. Apple had made some major hires from the automotive industry in the last 18 months. The most high profile being British-born Chris Porritt, former vice-president of vehicle engineering at Tesla and chief engineer at Aston Martin during the development of the DB9 and One-77 cars. Formerly of Tesla and Aston Martin, Chris Porritt now works at AppleYouTube/Tesla Other new staff included Jonathan Cohen, an artificial intelligence expert who was the director of deep learning at Nvidia, five former employees of A123 Systems, an electric car battery maker; Doug Betts, a former senior vice-president of Chrysler Group, and Rónán Ó Braonáin, an Irishman who used to work at BMW and more recently at Reviver, a company which created the world's first digital car number plate. Ó Braonáin's LinkedIn profile says his job title at Apple is 'Secret Agent'. Tesla chief executive Elon Musk described Project Titan in January 2016 as "an open secret". He told the BBC it was "obvious" that Apple was working on an electric car, adding: "It's pretty hard to hide something if you hire over a thousand engineers to do it." It was reported in 2015 that Apple was keen to work with BMW and use the platform of its electric i3 city car for its own vehicle project. Tim Cook was reported to have visited the i3 production line to learn more about it. However, discussions broke down and Apple was more recently believed to be looking to work with Magna, a Canadian-Austrian construction company which currently assembles the Mini range for BMW. In late September, 2016 Apple was reported to be interested in buying McLaren, the British sports carmaker, Formula One team owner and advanced technology company. Talks between the two companies took place at the carmaker's Woking headquarters earlier in the year, but have since 'stalled', insiders claim.

Cook said that even though the iPhone turns ten next year, the technology is anything but mature. Smartphones are 9 years old, he noted. "We are not even teenagers yet. We just got going." Given the promise of AI and other new technologies, Cook said, "I think there is an incredible future ahead."   Cook also revealed that one of the many focuses of research that will take place at the new Apple R&D center opening in Yokohama in December will be artificial intelligence. It will be an R&D center for 'deep engineering' and very different from the R&D that they'll be doing in two of their new Chinese facilities (one and two).   Cooks said that "I cannot tell you the specifics. The specific work is very different." However, Cook did say that Apple intends to capitalize on AI in various ways, in cooperation with Japanese companies. AI is "horizontal in nature, running across all products" and is used "in ways that most people don't even think about," such as increasing device battery life, asking Apple Music to recommend new music to subscribers or help you remember where your car is parked.   Beyond that, Cook suggested his company wants to use Apple Pay, the iPhone and the Apple Watch to promote a cashless society. "We would like to be a catalyst for taking cash out of the system," he said. "We don't think the consumer particularly likes cash."   Lastly, Cook seemed unperturbed by criticism that Apple has produced few innovative products in recent years. He emphasized the company's strategy of expanding the scope of smart devices from accessories for life to tools for business, medical care and other purposes.   You could read more about his interview with Nikkei here.

The team leading the project has refocused on developing an independent driving system that gives Apple the choice to partner with existing automakers or return to designing its own vehicle down the road, according to Bloomberg, citing sources familiar with the project. A spokesman for Apple declined to comment. Last month, The New York Times reported that the tech giant started to rethink its strategy and had laid off dozens of employees on its self-driving car project, including shuttering parts of its project completely. Apple reportedly started Project Titan in 2014 to make a mark in the auto industry. Apple's stock was trading slightly higher in premarket trade Monday. The stock is up more than 11 percent year to date. Read the full report from Bloomberg here.

There are also not many mass market products undergoing the kind of technological innovation we're seeing right now in the smartphone market; Apple's flagship product, the iPhone, is about to get a major facelift in 2017 and even more exciting new tech is expected soon after. The auto industry fits the bill in both cases, so it's not exactly a mystery why Apple is reportedly working on making an entrance at some point in the coming decade. The cars of tomorrow will look, function and perform like nothing on the market today, and there is a tremendous amount of money to be made by the companies that lead the way. Some might say the auto industry has "Apple" written all over it right now. According to a new report, however, Apple's efforts to build and release its own car have been halted. DON'T MISS: New report suggests the mysterious new Apple product we told you about is the real deal Apple had reportedly assembled a team to secretly work on "Project Titan," the company's internal codename for its automobile project. Numerous reports have stated that the company was working toward producing a fully electric car with next-generation features that would include advanced self-driving technology. Apple is already falling behind in this area, considering how many millions of miles self-driving car solutions have recorded on public roads from rival companies at this point, but Apple rarely concerns itself with being first to market when developing new products and solutions. Instead, the company works to build the best product it can. When it comes to self-driving technology, building the best product may have become the sole purpose of Apple's internal team that has been working on Project Titan. A new report from Bloomberg on Monday morning reiterates that Apple's Titan team has undergone a big shift that resulted in hundreds of employees having been reassigned or let go. That shift, according to the report, moves the team's focus away from building a car and onto the development of a self-driving autonomous car platform. Apple initially assembled a team of about 1,000 employees to develop, build and release a car by 2020, according to reports that first began to surface last year. But now, according to Bloomberg, the team's primary goal has changed: They will have to develop an autonomous driving solution and prove its feasibility by the end of next year.

Comments Computerworld | Oct 17, 2016 4:11 AM PT RELATED TOPICS Apple iOS Artificial Intelligence Mobile & Wireless Apple iOS 9 iPhone 7 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Comments Pixar founder George Lucas may have given the world the word “Droid” before he sold the company to Apple’s Steve Jobs, but Apple CEO Tim Cook makes no secret that he wants his company to play its part in making intelligence in machines a reality. Smart business Cook talked up Apple’s efforts in augmented reality just last week. This week he’s spilling at least some of the beans on his company’s plans for Artificial Intelligence, though his vision seems more connected to machine intelligence and pattern recognition than the evolution of a smart bot like C3PO, at least right now. “A.I. is horizontal in nature, running across all products,” he told Nikkei. He said it is used "in ways that most people don't even think about." What kinds of uses is he talking about? Cook gave us three specific examples, all of which belong firmly in the pattern recognition and machine learning fold, rather than the neural intelligence bracket: A.I. to increase battery life Apple Music recommendation Remember where you parked the car Which all sounds pretty promising until you recognize he actually didn’t tell us anything at all – Apple’s already doing all of these things in iOS. ‘Deep engineering’ The company has bigger plans. Cook visited Japan last week and while there revealed plans to open a new R&D base in Yokohoma, Japan, later this year. This will supplement its other R&D bases focused on A.I., with one thought to be in Seattle following its earlier purchase of Turi. The CEO said the new Japanese R&D center would be for “deep engineering,” which could mean anything but I can’t help thinking about deep learning systems, based entirely on the way he phrased that. Deep learning systems are the kind of neural network intelligence IBM has been working on with Watson. These self-learning machines are able to acquire new skills and make autonomous decisions, which distinguishes them from dumb, script-based bots you may find on Fcebook, responsive voice assistant solutions like Siri or single-use robots used on production lines. The idea is you can put deep learning inside anything and it will be able to improve what it does over time, responding to your needs, the local situation and contextual events. The ability to respond to events in a contextual fashion is what will eventually separate truly smart machine intelligence to what we have at present, though evolving these solutions will take much more time than the hype would have you believe. Hype machine The hype surrounding A.I. right now actually does all the firms involved in it a disservice. The modest kind of aims Cook told Nikkei about are tangible and possible using current technologies, but the hype machine means people already expect flawed man-machines desperate to open the cabin doors for some geezer called “Hal.” That’s not to say even the machine intelligence that’s being created at this moment won’t leave millions on the planet unemployed – it will, and right now there seems little political will to deal with that looming problem. Returning to Apple’s adventures in A.I., Cook noted that his company has teamed up with IBM to develop health care solutions for the elderly. That’s part of an international effort on the part of Apple, with big hospitals placing iPads and other Apple kit on wards, providing everything from patient information to patient entertainment and more. When it comes to care for the elderly, there are implications for use of Apple Watch as a tracking device for those suffering memory loss, medication reminders or even as panic alarms for those wishing to live independent lives. On another tangent to machine intelligence, Cook also discussed the Didi investment. The ride sharing economy is of “great interest to us,” he said. “[China’s] middle class will want a much better way of moving around.” The implication across all of this is that while the technologies that will enable truly autonomous road transport, Memories identification in Photos, proactive health care monitoring or even the place you parked your car can all be seen as some form of A.I., Apple’s intention is to deploy intelligent assistance in subtle yet profound ways. Apple’s A.I. will not be technology for the sake of it and the company wants to protect your privacy while it brings you convenience. There are some say Apple is late to this party. They are wrong. The evolutoin of real machine intelligence is going to take time yet, and while first stage machine intelligence is already transforming lives (for good and for ill) those who claim victory in that race today should simmer down a little; this industry's barely left the starting grid, the finishing line is some way ahead.

(GPRO) Stock Slammed by Karma Drone Recall Recent Posts: Why Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Ended the Free Supercharger Ride Apple Inc.’s (AAPL) New MacBook Pro Is Actually a Monster Hit GoPro Inc. (GPRO) Stock Slammed by Karma Drone Recall View All Posts If there was an iPhone 7 “feature” that was going to be a PR headache for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), most people would have picked the decision to ax the headphone jack. While that move has been far from popular, it’s now being overshadowed by complaints that the new iPhone’s home button doesn’t work with gloves — even the special ones made for use with touchscreen devices. Source: Apple It also won’t work with many waterproof and full-screen protective cases. Why the iPhone 7 Home Button is a Problem AAPL made a big change with the iPhone 7 home button. It left the button there and it looks the same as before, but the physical mechanism is gone. Instead, the iPhone 7 home button is solid state. There’s no click, it acts like a touchscreen and responds with haptic feedback. Immediately after Apple’s launch announcement, there was grumbling about that feedback being unnatural. However, it wasn’t until the new iPhone got into the wild that people starting picking up on the fact that the new home button appears to only work with direct skin contact. Many gloves and full-screen, protective/waterproof cases won’t work with it. 10 Growth Stocks That Will Outrun Google So who cares if the iPhone 7 is essentially incompatible with many waterproof cases? After all, water resistance is one of the big selling points of AAPL’s new iPhone. There’s a difference between water resistant and waterproof, however. A waterproof case lets you spend time underwater with a smartphone while water resistance provides protection to survive an accidental dunk. There are also specialized cases that offer full-device protection, including a touch-compatible film over the home button. These are especially popular with outdoors enthusiasts, people who work in physically demanding jobs and kids. Some iPhone users are going to be put out and case manufacturers will be scrambling to figure a way around this technical curveball. The bigger problem for most people may be the incompatibility with gloves. On the surface, this sounds like a minor issue, and if you live in a temperate climate it may be. But if you live anywhere that it gets cold in the winter — like a large swath of North America — it’s much more than that. An entire industry has grown up around gloves that can be used with touchscreens. They were the missing link as smartphones exploded in popularity and consumers discovered they couldn’t use their new apps or even make a phone call without removing their gloves and exposing their bare hands to the freezing temperatures. The development of touchscreen-friendly gloves, with fingertips coated with a capacitive material, was a big win for those living in northern climes. Reports that many of these gloves don’t work with the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus aren’t going over well. AAPL iOS 10 Changes Make the Problem Worse A longtime iOS feature was ditched in iOS 10, making the home button problem even worse. A side swipe of the iPhone screen traditionally brings up the pass-code entry screen to unlock the device, bypassing Touch ID. If that were still the case, iPhone 7 users would be safe even in the winter. Their touchscreen gloves would still let them swipe, enter their passcode as usual and carry on. But in iOS 10, Apple ditched this feature, relying on a home button click to either unlock using Touch ID or bring up the passcode screen. Since the iPhone 7 home button won’t work with most gloves and many waterproof cases, owners can’t even get to the passcode screen. Is There a Solution? Using the iPhone’s AssistiveTouch mode can be a workaround, although it’s kludgey. Apple may also release an iOS 10 update if the outcry gets bad enough. Apple Inc. (AAPL): How the iPhone Changed the World, 10 Years Later Also, because some capacitive gloves apparently do work with the iPhone 7 home button, glove designers will likely be able to figure out what works and what doesn’t to produce new iPhone 7-friendly versions. However, that would mean new gloves for a lot of people and will take time. Then again, after ditching the iPhone headphone jack, AAPL clearly doesn’t have a big issue with nudging people into upgrading their accessories. As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

October 17 AAPL: 117.55 -0.08 Apple reportedly halts development of electric car, Project Titan focusing on autonomous self-driving platform ‘for now’ Benjamin Mayo - 4 weeks ago @bzamayo Apple Car View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Apple has reportedly changed its near-term plans for the Project Titan electric car project, moving away from the development of a vehicle for the time being. After Bob Mansfield took the helm in July, Apple changed its outlook for the team according to Bloomberg. Hundreds of employees have been let go or re-assigned with the remaining members focusing on development of a self-driving autonomous car platform. In the future, Apple may return to developing its own vehicle or could partner with an existing car manufacturer. Apparently, executives have set a late 2017 deadline for the team to “prove the feasibility” of the autonomous driving system. Reports about the project shifting gears towards the software stack first surfaced in July. The initial vision for Project Titan back in 2014 was for Apple to develop its own electric car from the ground up, with a target release date of 2020. The team comprised about 1000 employees in total. Bloomberg says that that headcount is about the same because the company has hired people focused on its new AI efforts, despite the aforementioned layoffs. A New York Times article  in early September also claimed that Apple had laid off dozens of employees as it rebooted the car project. The report says Apple ran into issues with the car manufacturing process. It could not secure agreements with suppliers over components in the same way Apple dominates the supply chain for the iPhone. Project Titan was also stranded in the middle of leadership battles. Steve Zadesky stepped down from leading Project Titan in early 2016, as part of an “incredible failure of leadership”. The report says Apple executives had imagined creating a car that could recognize the driver based on biometric fingerprint. Apple was considering designs that didn’t even include a steering wheel or pedals, such that the vehicle was fully autonomous. It remains to be seen what will happen next with Apple’s electric car efforts, as Apple is unlikely to be developing a self-driving platform with the intention to license it. If the “feasibility” of the technology is affirmed, it seems likely that Apple will have to decide how it wants to make the hardware once again, potentially through a partnership with an existing auto-manufacturer. The 2020 launch date bandied about by previous rumors has most likely slipped giving these latest developments, if indeed Apple is halting product development on anything but the self-driving system until late next year. Right now, Apple’s public-facing involvement with the car revolves around the CarPlay media interface (pictured above) and new proactive features in iOS 10 that help users find their parked car.

October 17 AAPL: 117.55 -0.08 Interview: Tim Cook says Apple’s aim is a cashless society; working to boost the role of AI Ben Lovejoy - 4 weeks ago @benlovejoy AAPL Apple Pay AI View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Tim Cook has told the Nikkei Asian Review that the company hopes that Apple Pay will help to bring about a cashless society. The statement was made a month before the iPhone 7 becomes the first iPhone to support FeliCa, the contactless payment standard used in Japan. We would like to be a catalyst for taking cash out of the system. We don’t think the consumer particularly likes cash. Cook also spoke rather mysteriously about the work that will be performed by the R&D center the company is building in Yokohama, expected to open in March … The facility — the first of its kind outside the U.S. — will develop new component technologies. Cook described it as a center for “deep engineering” and said it will be “very different” from the R&D base Apple plans to build in China. “I cannot tell you the specifics,” he said. “The specific work is very different.”  It does, though, seem that broadening the role played by AI across all Apple products may be the primary focus. Cook said that most people only think of the more explicit examples of machine learning, like Siri, where the reality is that AI runs across all products in all kinds of ways. “We want the AI to increase your battery life” and recommend music to Apple Music subscribers, he continued. As another example, he said AI could “help you remember where you parked your car.” iOS currently relies on the rather crude method of noting a disconnection from CarPlay or an in-car Bluetooth audio unit to detect when you’ve parked your car. Cook is currently touring Japan – surprisingly, his first visit since becoming CEO. He has so far met with Nintendo execs and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. [Update: Nikkei originally reported that the new facility would develop ‘AI and other technologies’ before updating the report to say ‘new component technologies.] Guides AAPL Get the latest AAPL stock and company news View THe Guide Apple Pay Apple Pay is Apple's mobile payments solution first introduced in 2014.

This GT3 RS PDK has been given an Apple Computer makeover, thus reminding us of the Porsche 935 K3 racecar Apple sponsored back in the 80s. As a reminder, we're talking about an 800 hp Le Mans animal that could easily make the GT3 RS we have here look tame. Returning to the 991, we'll mention the design of the wrap mixes the Apple Computer take with a beater approach, as if the car had spent years on the racetrack. The styling comes from digital artist Skepple, whose work we've featured before. The level of details on this wrap is simply amazing and you can spend quite some time immersed in the visual experience. As those of you following our wrap stories know, the mix involving a racing livery and a motorsport patina take seems to be the latest trend these days. Interestingly, while the car left the factory dressed in Viper Green, which is already one of the wildest Porsche shades out there, its owner seemes to have enjoyed giving his rear-engined coupe a fresh appearance. In fact, we've added some photos coming from the man's Instagram below, so you can see all the visual stages the track-savvy machine has been through so far. Notice that, just like the Porsche Exclusive (the carmaker's individualization arm) specialists recommend, the driver of this GT3 RS also likes to match the... livery of the key fob with that of the car. Then again, when your car has the ignition switch on the "wrong" side of the steering wheel, it's impossible to overlook the endurance racing heritage that led to this feature, so we can easily understand the guy's taste in colors.   A photo posted by @slipr35 on Oct 13, 2016 at 10:31pm PDT   A photo posted by @slipr35 on Oct 15, 2016 at 9:59am PDT   A photo posted by @slipr35 on Oct 15, 2016 at 10:45am PDT   A photo posted by @slipr35 on Oct 15, 2016 at 10:44am PDT   A photo posted by @slipr35 on Oct 15, 2016 at 10:42am PDT   Thanks to @jamie_gt3 the #Porsche #991gt3rs is breathing easy with Dundon long tube headers.

Tech-Recipes: A Cookbook Full of Tech Tutorials Tech-Recipes: A Cookbook Full of Tech Tutorials Contact Us About Us Advertise Android Apple Windows Internet Database Programming Apps How to Disable Press Home to Unlock on iPhone iOS 10 Posted October 17, 2016 by Leomar Umpad in Apple iPhone, iPad When Apple first introduced iPhone, defective Home buttons were not uncommon. Because it is used so often, the Home button could be damaged from overuse. The problem is so prevalent that Apple introduced Assistive Touch – an on-screen button that serves as an alternative to the physical Home button. Another alternative the Home button Touch ID which uses your finger print to unlock your device. With the update to iOS 10, Apple now requires users to press the Home button to unlock their iPhones. Many are frowning on this change because of concerns that it could affect the Home button’s durability in the long run. This tutorial explains how you can disable the Press Home to Unlock option on iPhone and enable Rest Finger to Open (Touch ID). How to Enable Rest Finger to Open on iPhone Now that the design and materials used on recent iPhones have been upgraded, the Home button can outlast the device itself. However, some users would rather not risk wearing theirs out.

According to a report from Bloomberg, the company is no longer attempting to build its own electric car to compete with companies like Tesla, but is instead focused on developing self-driving software it can deploy in partnership with existing carmakers. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman and Alex Webb write that in recent months, hundreds of members of Apple's 1,000-strong car team have been "reassigned, let go, or have left of their own volition." Company executives have reportedly issued a deadline of late 2017 to decide on the car's final direction, with this change said to be triggered by "months of strategy disagreements, leadership flux and supply chain challenges." Apple originally started Project Titan in 2014, and had ambitious plans to shake up the auto industry as it had the mobile business. As Apple's COO Jeff Williams said in 2015: "The car is the ultimate mobile device, isn’t it?" However, it seems the company underestimated the complexity of the task, particularly the challenges of automotive supply chains. Today's report follows a similar story from Bloomberg in July and another from The New York Times in September. Apple, meanwhile, has yet to even acknowledge that it has a secret car project, although CEO Tim Cook did allude to it at the company's most recent annual shareholders' meeting. "Do you remember when you were a kid, and Christmas Eve, it was so exciting, you weren’t sure what was going to be downstairs?" said Cook in February. "Well, it’s going to be Christmas Eve for a while." Now though, Apple risks disappointing fans when they do finally get a look at what's under the tree.

 Apple wants to use AI to turbo-charge your iPhone's battery life Rob Price Oct. 17, 2016, 7:35 AM 3,234 facebook linkedin twitter email print Will Wei/Business Insider Apple wants to use artificial intelligence (AI) to turbo-charge the battery life of your iPhone. In an interview with The Nikkei Asian Review published Monday, CEO Tim Cook said that the company is looking at integrating AI technology across its products to improve them. While the tech is most commonly associated with chatbots like Apple's Siri or Google's Assistant, it can be used "in ways that most people don't even think about," Cook said. A key example he gave was making your devices last longer in between charges: "We want the AI to increase your battery life." Earlier this year, Google announced it had integrated AI into its power-hungry data centres — and it managed to produce savings of up to 40% by automatically figuring out the most efficient way to run things. Apple (and others) could try and achieve similar gains in smartphones and other commercial devices by using AI to optimise battery life and reduce power consumption. Battery life is a constant pain for just about every smartphone on the market. The iPhone lasts around a day, and even the most energy efficient consumer devices only last 2 or 3 — far less than dumbphones from before the smartphone era, that could last a week or so on a single day. The race for ever-thinner and more-powerful devices means that any gains in energy efficiency or battery tech from year to year typically just result in more features being crammed into a device, rather than meaningful improvements in battery life. As such, any improvements — whether from AI, or anywhere else — will be sure to be welcomed by consumers. EXCLUSIVE FREE REPORT: 25 Big Tech Predictions by BI Intelligence.

Master Herald Sports Technology TV Social Cars Politics Middle East Pulse Menu Sports Technology TV Social Cars Politics Middle East Pulse Apple’s iOS 10 Jailbreak Release Date Rumours, Updates, The OS To Be Released Only After Apple. Inc Announces Its Update! Posted By: Arash FekriPosted date: October 18, 2016In: Technology Page 1 of 212» After Apple rolled out updates for the OS, iOS10 Jailbreak is still out of sight.  These updates were released to block out jailbreakers like Pangu. However, it is believed that other hackers including Pangu, have been quietly developing a jailbreak for the OS update. All the while, Apple keeps on releasing more updates, in hopes of staying ahead of the game, and slow hackers down.In the meantime, staying on previous OS versions will expectedly allow iOS users to sustain the majority of their jailbroken apps on their devices. Pangu is believed to have quite a serious bit of work cut out for them. As jailbreaking the newly launched Apple iOS 10 is not exactly a piece of cake. The present scenario shows that the renowned jailbreak group is unable to make an iOS 10 Jailbreak. The trouble in the making of the iOS 10 Jailbreak appears to be because of the update speed of the new operating system. This seems to be a huge hurdle in the progress of the creation of an iOS 10 Jailbreak. The infamous jailbreak group has been silent for a while now, which further facilitates the rumors of their failure in coming up with a Jailbreak iOS 10. This tradition of keeping mum started way back since the iOS 9.3 was released. This was an OS, which was capable of countering jailbreak, and the subsequent operating systems that followed were the same. Apple even went as far as absolutely discrediting the digital signing of iOS varieties younger than the iOS 9.3. This step made it impossible for handset operators to go back to the version of iOS that has a functioning jailbreak. The iOS 9.3 jailbreak that Cydia had errored in was deemed as risky for use. The iOS 10 Jailbreak that we have today seems to be in a sticky situation; as so far there has not been any group to effectively produce a working and safe iOS 10 Jailbreak. It appears that Apple has finally been able to thwart jailbreaking for their new iOS, and seemingly for those to come in the future also. The developers of iOS 10 jailbreak are reportedly waiting for iOS 10 updates to slow down a little. What this would mean is that the hackers would get sufficient time to build the jailbreak, without having to worry about a fresher update launching. According to reports, the sole way of maintaining tweaks and apps with Cydia would be to remain with the iOS 9.3.2 or iOS 9.3.3 jailbreak phones. Now, even though we know that the jailbreak group is maintaining silence, this could also mean, however, that the coming of the iOS 10 Jailbreak, was neither denied, nor confirmed.  They might be occupied trying to find ways around the new security measures that the Cupertino-based tech giant, has set up to counter their efforts. According to iJailbreak.com, that is exactly the situation that Pangu is waiting for. By that same report, it is now being believed, after a demonstration of Cydia running on iOS 10, which is concrete evidence that the OS can be jailbroken. People are hence speculating that Pangu has finished its work. But the group will only make its next move after the big signal from Apple. In case one is wondering what, the next move might be, only one thing comes to mind – the announcement of iOS 10.1.  In the previous two versions of the OS, it’s highly probable that the Apple has included patches intended to close the exploits that jailbreak developers have been working on.
