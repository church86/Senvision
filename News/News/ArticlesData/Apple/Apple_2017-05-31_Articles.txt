The Case For The Touchscreen Mac Anthony Caruana Jun 1, 2017, 3:30pm ⋅ Filed to:  apple Australian Stories mac touch screens Share Image: Supplied Next week, Apple will be running its annual developer shindig, the Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC). This is the event we get to see the next versions of Apple's operating systems. Apple now has four distinct hardware platforms, each running its own OS. Traditional computers get macOS, phones and tablets get iOS, watches get watchOS and tvOS looks after the company's set-top box hobby. But what if this year's WWDC is the start of a consolidation, with iOS and macOS pulling back together? When the first iPhone was released, its software was a new set of modifications to the Darwin Unix distribution that OS X (later renamed macOS) came from. In that sense, iOS is really a fork from macOS. The two computing platforms share a common foundation. This week, according to French site Consomac, Apple registered some new product numbers that fit into the Mac and iPad product lines. apple is usually very coy about making announcements or commenting on unreleased products (their "Apple doesn't comment..." response to media is well known). But given the success of 2-in-1 computers with business and consumer users, and how Windows 10 has filled the breach between tablet and traditional computer devices, it would not be surprising to see Apple push back into that space. Over the last few years, we've seen both macOS and iOS lose some of their 3D styling with buttons, window design and other UI elements becoming flatter. macOS also has Launchpad, which looks a lot like an iOS home-screen lending further support to the potential for a touchscreen Mac. Whether that starts with portable of desktop systems is anyone's guess. The Surface Studio is a sensational device and I'm sure there are a few designers in Cupertino smarting over how Microsoft has kicked their arses with that design. My gut feeling is Apple is going to release a new platform next week, one that brings touchscreen capability to macOS. What do you think?

Apple could debut the speaker as soon as its annual developer conference in June, but the device will not be ready to ship until later in the year, the people said. By: Bloomberg | Published:June 1, 2017 11:08 am Apple has started manufacturing a long-in-the-works Siri-controlled smart speaker, according to people familiar with the matter. Related News Google expands paid carpooling across California YouTube app for Android gets new UI, adds bottom navigation bar Google’s Nest Labs wants your home security camera to recognise you Apple Inc. is already in your pocket, on your desk and underneath your television. Soon, a device embossed with “Designed by Apple in California” may be on your nightstand or kitchen counter as well. The iPhone-maker has started manufacturing a long-in-the-works Siri-controlled smart speaker, according to people familiar with the matter. Apple could debut the speaker as soon as its annual developer conference in June, but the device will not be ready to ship until later in the year, the people said. The device will differ from Amazon.com Inc.’s Echo and Alphabet Inc.’s Google Home speakers by offering virtual surround sound technology and deep integration with Apple’s product lineup, said the people, who requested anonymity to discuss products that aren’t yet public. Introducing a speaker would serve two main purposes: providing a hub to automate appliances and lights via Apple’s HomeKit system, and establishing a bulwark inside the home to lock customers more tightly into Apple’s network of services. That would help combat the competitive threat from Google’s and Amazon’s connected speakers: the Home and Echo mostly don’t support services from Apple. Without compatible hardware, users may be more likely to opt for the Echo or Home, and therefore use streaming music offerings such as Spotify, Amazon Prime Music or Google Play rather than Apple Music. “This will be a platform for developing Apple’s services,” says Gene Munster, a co-founder of Loup Ventures and former Apple analyst. Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller declined to comment. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook has emphasized Apple’s services businesses over the past 18 months as iPhone sales slowed. He expects service revenue to double by 2020 from last year’s $24 billion. A speaker may help keep customers loyal to service products such as Apple Music, a subscription music streaming offering that costs $10 per month. The speaker would likely be tucked into Apple’s “Other Products” category, which currently includes devices like the Apple Watch, Apple TV and AirPods. That set of products generated $11 billion in sales last year. Inventec Corp., the Taipei manufacturer that already makes the AirPod wireless headphones, will add the speaker to its Apple repertoire, the people said. Apple employees have been secretly testing the device in their homes for several months, they said. The Siri speaker reached an advanced prototype stage late last year, Bloomberg News reported at the time. An Inventec representative didn’t respond to a request for comment outside normal business hours in Taiwan. This year’s developers conference will be the first since 2013 to introduce new hardware. Apple could announce updated iPad tablets at the conference, one of the people said. Apple last updated the 9.7-inch iPad Pro in March 2016 and hasn’t refreshed the larger 12.9-inch model since its November 2015 debut. Planned Mac updates will include refreshed versions of the MacBook and MacBook Pro with faster Intel Corp. processors, Bloomberg News reported earlier this month. Apple hopes that more advanced acoustics technology will give the speaker an edge over competitors, according to people with knowledge of the product’s development. Along with generating virtual surround sound, the speakers being tested are louder and reproduce sound more crisply than rival offerings, the people said. Apple has also considered including sensors that measure a room’s acoustics and automatically adjust audio levels during use, one of the people said. Apple will also likely let third-party services build products for the speaker. Last year, Apple opened up Siri on the iPhone to the likes of Uber Technologies Inc. and Facebook Inc., allowing a user to order a ride or send a WhatsApp message with a voice command. The device will be a hub for Apple’s HomeKit home automation system, letting users control devices such as lights, door locks and window blinds. At present, an Apple TV or iPad is required to control that equipment from outside the home or automatically. The Echo and Google Home both support third-party services and smart home appliances. Ahead of Apple’s launch, the competition has upgraded their speakers with support for making voice calls, while Amazon’s gained a touchscreen. Apple’s speaker won’t include such a screen, according to people who have seen the product. An Apple-designed speaker with high-end sound quality that fits perfectly into the Apple ecosystem is a familiar pitch. In 2006, Apple unveiled the iPod Hi-Fi, a battery powered speaker designed to cast a shadow over the thriving iPod third-party accessory market. With its bulky size and high price point, the Hi-Fi flopped and was discontinued within 18 months of launching. With Siri and a clear hole in its ecosystem, Apple is banking that its second try at a speaker product will do better.

');//--> } Home Invest with Barry Speaking Book Contact WWDC: 13 Million Nerds Apple’s Counting On May 31, 2017 7:00pm by Barry Ritholtz   This is very interesting, via Bloomberg: Investment managers are doubling down on the hottest stocks of 2017 — and it’s paying off. Funds tracked by Bank of America Corp. own the highest percentage of technology stocks on record compared to their benchmark. It’s a sector that’s carried U.S. stocks to new highs, leading the S&P 500 Index with a nearly 20 percent gain in 2017. And it’s giving active managers a boost they haven’t seen in more than two years. Of course, not all technology stocks are created equal. The returns in tech are top-heavy, dominated by Facebook Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Netflix Inc. and Google’s parent Alphabet Inc., also known as the FANG stocks, as well as Apple Inc. Those five companies alone account for more than a quarter of the S&P 500’s advance this year. Here is the write up at Soundcloud: If you own an iPhone, chances are you’ve used Apple’s App Store to buy and download apps. For years, while iPhones were flying off the shelves, Apple had the power to dictate the rules of how software developers all over the world made those apps– and made money from them. Now, with the global market for smartphones slowing, the iPhone maker is looking to sweeten its relationship with the 13 million developers it relies on to generate revenue from the App Store. The inner workings of Apple’s business are notoriously opaque, but this week Bloomberg Technology’s Alex Webb and Brad Stone take you into the world of the developers themselves, to hear what it’s actually been like to work with Apple– and to find out how the world’s most valuable company is trying to change that.

There has been a flurry of iPhone 8 leaks ranging from renders to alleged schematics. Of course, these are meant to inform and excite hardcore Apple fanatics. While most leaks have shown what the tenth anniversary iPhone might look like, none of them have clearly shown how it compares to other phones in the market. Fortunately, the people at iDrop News were kind enough to show just how big, or small, the iPhone 8 will be. The comparison shows the iPhone 8 with the current iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. And from there, it can be seen that is is only slightly bigger than the iPhone 7. In addition to the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, the upcoming flagship is also compared with the Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8+. Compared to the Galaxy S8, the display is slightly wider as it is taller. On the other hand, the iPhone 8 and the Galaxy S8+ are roughly the same width in display. iPhone 8 compared with iPhone 7 and 7 Plus (via idropnews.com) iPhone 8 compared with Galaxy S8 (via idropnews.com) Readers should note that these images are based on the iPhone 8 schematics that were leaked last week. As can be seen in all of the photos, the top most part of the screen has a cutout for the front 3D camera sensors as well as the speaker grilles and the infrared sensors. It should also be noted that these images are not to be confused with what Apple might envision the phone will be. Apple has remained tight-lipped with all the leaks that have gone out so far, as it always had been. Consumers should not expect an official comment from the company regarding these renderings for you will not be getting one. On the other hand, Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference is happening early next week. At the said event, the company is expected to announce its next iteration of iOS, the iOS 11. Perhaps there might be a chance, no matter haow slim it is, that Apple will show just a glimpse of the iPhone 8. However, do not take our word for it.

That would explain the MateBook X, the Chinese company's first laptop. However, as it tends to happen with Huawei (and a few other Chinese companies) for its first device it has looked at Apple for some inspiration, copying the design of MacBook in the MateBook X. However, similar designs aside there is one major difference between the MateBook X and the Matebook. The Huawei laptop is powered by Windows whereas the Apple MacBook uses Apple's own macOS. In terms of design, the Huawei laptop not only looks very similar to the MacBook, with the similar edges, lid design and metal body but also seemingly copies the keyboard design and large trackpad from Apple's machine. The result is that the MateBook X looks like a very attractive laptop, although we must caution that good looks are no guarantee for good performance or features similar to what Apple offers in the MacBook. In the last few years, starting with Intel's Ultrabooks, we have seen again and again companies trying to copy Apple's laptop design but failing to match the high-standards that MacBooks set in the mobile computing. In terms of specifications, the MateBook X looks like a competent laptop. It has a 13-inch screen and weighs 1.05 kilograms. It also comes with a Core i7 processor, 512GB or 256GB internal storage, and 8GB or 4GB RAM. One highlight of the MateBook X that its screen has a high resolution of 1440P, which is something still a rarity in the 13-inch laptops. It also comes with a fingerprint scanner and it uses Windows 10 Home edition. For now Huawei hasn't announced the price of the MateBook X. Along with the X variant, the company has also announced the D variant (bigger) and E variant (cheaper with cheaper hardware). However, pricing and launch details of the all the laptops are not yet revealed. It is safe to assume that the MateBook X and the other laptops in the series will first hit the global markets. Although Huawei often brings its latest smartphones to India with some urgency, the company may not show the same for the MateBook considering the fact that premium laptop market in India is still relatively small.

Click to Skip Ad Closing in... Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Business Image Source: Essential Andy Rubin’s new company already got screwed by Apple Chris Mills @chrisfmills May 31st, 2017 at 5:31 PM Share Tweet Andy Rubin, the former Googler who founded Android, is no stranger to fighting with Apple. After all, he and his mobile platform have been locked in an unending battle with the iPhone for the last ten years. But even though his new company doesn’t have much to do with mobile operating systems, it’s already lost out because of Apple. During a talk yesterday evening, Rubin confirmed that Essential, his new company, lost out on a $100 million investment because of a perceived conflict with Apple. For a company that’s technically a startup, a $100 million investment is nothing to laugh at. Don't Miss: T-Mobile is having one of its biggest ever giveaways Rubin basically confirmed a story first reported by the WSJ in March: Essential was close to a deal with SoftBank’s Vision Fund for a $100 million investment, which would have valued Rubin’s startup at $1 billion. The paperwork was reportedly in the final stages when SoftBank decided to pass, thanks to SoftBank’s ties to Apple. The Vision Fund is a $100 billion fund that invests in new technology, and Apple has previously put $1 billion into the fund. If the deal between Essential and SoftBank had gone through, that would’ve meant that Apple would have a (tiny) stake in a rival smartphone maker. Although Apple didn’t object to the investment, SoftBank didn’t want the conflict to happen. The deal mattered less for the money, and more for the platform that SoftBank could have provided. Essential found investment cash elsewhere, but SoftBank had promised a major marketing push for the new Essential smartphone in Japan. As is, Essential is launching worldwide with zero support for major carriers. It’s difficult to overstate how hard it is for a luxury smartphone manufacturer to crack the market in the US. Apple and Samsung have near-total control over the luxury smartphone market, thanks to the long-established recognition the two brands have. The only hope a competitor has is to sell through carriers: virtually no-one buys a smartphone up-front off the internet, so sales through carrier-owned retail stores are often the only physical push a new phone has. A deal with SoftBank could have given Essential an in. SoftBank is the second-largest carrier in Japan, and also owns Sprint. A deal might have pushed Essential as the new kid on the block through SoftBank’s retail stores, giving the phone at least a chance to take on Apple and Samsung. As is, it looks like the Essential smartphone — which appears to be technologically stunning — is an expensive, splashy way of launching Essential Home, the company’s smart home play. Internet-connected gadgets are all good, but the big money is still in smartphones, and I’m not sure Essential would have spent all the money to develop a new flagship and not bother working with any carriers. Reading between the lines, it seems like Apple’s mere reputation might have killed a new competitor before it launched one single product.

Skip to content Fone Arena The Mobile Blog Menu Main Site Phones Gadgets About Media Coverage Advertising Contact Tip Us Twitter FB Youtube Apple is reportedly working on Siri powered smart speaker to take on Amazon and Google In a bid to compete with Amazon and Google, Apple is working on a smart speaker that will be powered by Siri, according to a latest report from Bloomberg. Apple is expected to announce the smart speaker at WWDC 2017 next week but it will not ship the device until later in the year. T The smart speaker will use Siri, the voice assistant software on the iPhone and Mac. Citing people familiar with the matter, the report said the smart speaker will come without a touchscreen. It will have a superior sound quality thanks to the virtual surround sound technology which is not present on Google Home and Amazon Echo Show. It will come with Apple Music integration and function as a HomeKit hub. This will most likely allow users to ask Siri to turn on the lights, play a specific song or adjust the home temperature. Apple will also reportedly let third parties build services for it. The Siri speaker is being manufactured by Inventec, the same company that makes the Apple’s AirPods, according to KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.

(Albany County Sheriff's Department) Photo: Karlin, Rick Sheriff sees drones as lifesaving tool 1 / 5 Back to Gallery Voorheesville With the possibility that rock climbing may eventually be permitted on the sheer limestone cliffs that plummet below Thacher State Park, it was as good a place as any to demonstrate what the Albany County Sheriff's Office has in mind for its new pair of unmanned aerial vehicles, or drones. "We can cover a lot of ground," Sheriff Craig Apple said, minutes before one of the department's three certified pilots, Lee Borman, launched the drone, which is about the size of a beach ball and equipped with four rotors and an airframe that can carry a camera and a mechanical hand. Borman demonstrated how the drone could carry a rescue rope over the 100-foot cliffs just yards away. Or, using an infrared sensor, it could spot a lost hiker and drop a phone, water bottle or radio to the person, as rescuers use the onboard GPS software to pinpoint a location. The drones can also be valuable in winter if someone falls through ice in a lake or other body of water. Rather than having rescuers risk falling through the ice, a drone can fly a rescue line out from the safety of the shoreline. Drones also can hover over burning buildings to help see where there are hot spots or people who may be trapped, and they can dip into hazardous material spills with sensors to see if any toxins have been released. They can be equipped with radiation detectors as well. "You can only do so much with a chopper,'' said Apple, adding that the drones can provide assistance that keeps rescuers out of harm's way. But the drones are not equipped with weapons. Apple stressed their use as crime-fighting tools has limits, due to the evolving nature of case law regarding the legal use of a drone in a criminal investigation. If police want to use a drone to view a criminal suspect's property, for example, they may need a search warrant because of the invasive spying capabilities of the devices. "Case law is going to determine that down the road,'' Apple said. "There are a lot of legal grounds that will have to be tested in years to come." Still, Apple didn't rule out their use in criminal cases and said he could see the drones being useful in situations in which someone may barricade themselves in a structure or used traps intended to harm someone. Drones can also scan large crowds and keep an eye out for potential problems or disturbances. The sheriff's office has also flown drones over the Albany County jail, but they need special permission from the FAA since the facility is so close to the Albany International Airport – an area that is generally off limits to drones. Another possible use is helping to recreate auto accident scenes from an aerial vantage point, said Edward Capovani, a Scotia-based consultant who was at Wednesday's demonstration. The drones aren't overly expensive – the DJI Inspire 1 used by the sheriff's office, a model also popular among hobbyists and photographers, lists for less than $2,000. But accessories including chemical sensors, high-resolution or infrared cameras, as well as GPS mapping gear, can raise costs to near $20,000. Apple said their department is outfitting the drones with seized criminal assets. He noted the cost is still a fraction of the $1,000-plus per hour it can cost to keep a helicopter in the air. The sheriff's office is one of several law enforcement agencies flying drones these days. In May, several local and state agencies attended a Homeland Security training session in Oneida County and one of the exercises included using drones in a mock manhunt through a forest. A week ago, State Park Police and sheriff's deputies from Livingston County used a drone to help find a dog that was stuck halfway down the 400-foot-deep Letchworth State Park gorge. The drone was able to pinpoint the dog's location and a parks' officer was then lowered by rope to retrieve the canine. At Wednesday's demonstration, officials from the state Department of Corrections and Community Supervision as well as State Police attended along with representatives from the state parks and environmental conservation departments. Also on the scene was Emily Barrett, from the University at Albany's College of Emergency Preparedness, Homeland and Cyber Security. The school, which has attracted hundreds of students who want to learn about disaster response and security, is looking at developing courses in the use of drones, she said. Thacher Park has been the scene of several drone flights recently. The park has undergone renovations with a new visitors center and there are plans to possibly open rock climbing routes on the cliffs, which are known as the Helderberg Escarpment. It wasn't immediately clear when the climbing might be allowed. The drones aren't totally foolproof, and they can't always outwit Mother Nature. Apple said another agency was recently testing one at Thacher Park when a hawk swooped down and brought the machine to the ground. The drone came though relatively unscathed since, presumably, the raptor quickly realized it wasn't edible and lost interest, he added. rkarlin@timesunion.com • 518-454-5758 • @RickKarlinTU News Videos Most Popular 1 Guilderland teen girl, 17, dies from crash injuries 2 Video captures theft by Albany bar patrons 3 17-year-old boy killed in Schaghticoke head-on crash 4 Authorities: 19 charged in New York mob takedown 5 Damaging winds, hail could hit Albany Wednesday 6 4 women offered illegal massages, Colonie police say 7 Video shows fight reported inside Rivers Casino View Comments © 2017 Hearst Communications, Inc.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Site Archive Apple Valley: Some mail-in ballots returned to Measure F voters Wednesday May 31, 2017 at 8:54 PM May 31, 2017 at 8:54 PM Matthew Cabe Staff Writer @DP_MatthewCabe APPLE VALLEY — An issue with a machine at the U.S. Post Office here has resulted in the return of some mail-in ballots for the June 6 special election on Measure F, sparking concern in the community. Apple Valley resident Carolyn Forston said both her and her husband’s ballots — postmarked May 27 — were returned Tuesday. “I thought I might have forgot to put a stamp on it, but it was all right,” Forston said. “The person helping me at the Post Office (on Wednesday) said, ‘You're the third one today.’” The returns worried Forston, who said many voters rely on mail-in ballots. “There are people out there who don't drive and that's why they have a mail-in ballot,” she said. “Because they don't have the means to take it in themselves. It doesn't say why it's returned, it's just returned. How would they know?” James Salley, customer service supervisor at the Post Office located off Highway 18, told the Daily Press one machine incorrectly read the barcodes on a small number of ballots. Those ballots were returned to voters. Salley described the situation as being “a luck of the draw” insofar as which ballots were processed incorrectly. “When it doesn’t read correctly, (the ballots are) being sent back (to the voters),” he said. “There’s no telling exactly what caused it … Better (for the voters) to bring it in themselves and drop it off.” A co-worker who handles a majority of the mail-in ballots said about 15 barcodes were read incorrectly, according to Salley, who added that he wasn’t aware of any voters dropping off mail-in ballots on Wednesday. The San Bernardino County Elections Office has issued 22,867 mail-in ballots in the town since April, according to data provided by Registrar of Voters Michael Scarpello, an increase of more than 4,500 since Apple Valley’s last special election in 2013. There are currently 36,608 registered voters in Apple Valley; nearly 63 percent have mail-in ballots. Scarpello said the county Elections Office is in talks with the town’s Post Office to determine if further issues exist. He described the situation as “a very isolated incident.” “We’ve only heard from one voter who said they had their ballot returned to them,” Scarpello said. Meanwhile, initial reports that returns also occurred during last year’s June primary and November general election were deemed false by Salley. “We had no problem with the ballots in November,” Salley said. “It's only affected the current mail-in ballot.” Some ballots were mailed back to voters last October, though, according to Scarpello, but he noted the issue stemmed from incorrectly placed stamps that resulted in faulty processing. “In this particular case, that would be a voter error, not a machine error,” he said, adding that the Post Office closely monitored that situation and instructed staff to deliver those ballots to supervisors rather than back to voters. Measure F could decide the fate of the town’s ongoing attempt to take Liberty Utilities’ water system by eminent domain. A “yes” vote would allow the town to borrow up to $150 million to acquire the system should a court grant that right; a “no” would likely end the takeover bid. Thus far, 6,305 Measure F ballots have been received by the Elections Office, according to Scarpello. Town spokesperson Charlene Engeron said the Town Clerk’s office has been in contact with the Registrar of Voters and the Post Office regarding the mail-in ballot issue. “One thing that's important ... is obviously if somebody gets their ballot back on June 7,” Engeron said. “Elections Code says (the ballot) has to be postmarked by June 6, so if they don't get it back before June 6, we’ll have to talk to Registrar of Voters.” An exact number of returns was unknown late Wednesday; however, for town voters whose ballots were returned, Scarpello suggested taking them back to the Post Office. The Elections Office is awaiting response from the Post Office on additional remedies. In the interim, mail-in ballots can also be taken to drop-off locations before June 6 and at polling places on Election Day, according to Scarpello, who said those locations are available on the Elections Office website, Scarpello said.

(Photo: Daniel Mears / The Detroit News)Buy Photo CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Jim Hackett, the newly appointed CEO of Ford, has the challenge of a lifetime. Ford right now is Nokia back when Apple and Google were building smartphones. Nokia was a world leader in mobile telephony but was disrupted by two Silicon Valley companies that had never built a phone before. Hackett’s challenge is simple: does Ford become the Nokia or Apple of transportation? Over the next decade and a half, the automobile business as we know it will vanish, and a new model of transportation will take its place. As we detail in Rethinking Transportation 2020-2030, a new report from the independent think tank RethinkX, autonomous electric vehicles (AEVs) will destroy individual gas-powered vehicle ownership. We anticipate that within 10 years of widespread regulatory approval of driverless vehicles, 95 percent of U.S. passenger miles will be traveled in on-demand AEVs providing transport as a service (TaaS). To survive, automakers will have to build new business models, becoming low-margin, high-volume assemblers of AEVs. Cost per mile will soon be the new metric for success, and focusing on driving down operating costs and increasing vehicle lifetimes is a key imperative. This transition is already in play. Volvo, now owned by Chinese automaker Geely, has announced they will not develop new diesel internal combustion engines and instead will focus investments on electrifying their fleet. New entrants are streaming into the industry. LG supplies the Chevy Bolt Powertrain, which accounts for more than half the value of that car. Hundreds of electric car, truck, and bus companies, as well as current Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers, are potential competitors in this space. To thrive automakers need to become high technology companies and get into the business of providing transportation as a service. This is where real opportunities will be found. Automakers must understand that the most value will be created by computer platforms, software and business model innovation. They will need creative thinking and quick execution — understanding the new revenue generating opportunities that come with a new mobility platform — from advertising, data monetization and entertainment to product sales, grid support, and other unseen opportunities. Self-driving technology will be a must, not an option. This will be one of the deepest, fastest and most profound disruptions of transportation in history. If automakers don’t react fast, they risk going out of business — playing catch up is extremely difficult. Nokia’s last CEO Stephen Elop said, “we didn’t do anything wrong and somehow we lost.” Ford’s board of directors will need to measure Hackett’s success using the new metrics of TaaS, cost per mile, rather than the old metrics of the auto industry, numbers of cars sold. Hackett will also have to ignore the mainstream experts and analysts who forecast a slow transition to AEVs, rather than the exponential rates of growth that are typical in technology disruptions. When Apple’s iPhone came out, a Bloomberg analyst mocked it, saying that its influence would be minimal and not impact Motorola and Nokia, since it would only appeal to “a few gadget freaks.” TaaS will be dramatically cheaper than individual car ownership, right from the start. Because of the extended vehicle lifetime of an EV, which can easily travel over 500,000 miles, and significantly lower fueling and maintenance costs, TaaS will be four to 10 times cheaper than individual vehicle ownership, rendering traditional metrics useless. The high utilization rates of TaaS vehicles — each capable of traveling 100,000 miles per year — will drastically reduce the number of passenger vehicles on U.S. roads, from 247 million in 2020 to 44 million in 2030, with production volumes dropping 70 percent. When technology disruption looms, it can be difficult for people with a vested interest to see it coming. Vehicle autonomy is the key uncertainty. Making investment decisions and balancing the needs of the existing business with the need to invest in the future, in the face of uncertainty, makes Hackett’s job even harder. Pure-play autonomous and electric vehicle companies have an advantage here: they don’t have to protect the sunk costs in the old business model. They see only opportunities. The transport as a service disruption is imminent. Fortune will favor those who see it not as a threat, but as the opportunity of a lifetime. Will Hacket be more like Apple’s Steve Jobs or Nokia’s Stephen Elop? You’ll know when you use that Ford TaaS app in your smartphone rather than Lyft or Uber to order a car to take you to work, home, or school on a daily basis. Tony Seba and James Arbib are co-authors of Rethinking Transportation, and co-founders of RethinkX.

Four recent tech breakouts — Apple (AAPL) iPhone supplier Analog Devices (ADI), Micron Technology (MU), Marvell Technology (MRVL) and Paylocity (PCTY) — remain in buy range. XAutoplay: On | Off During Wednesday's regular session, the major averages reversed lower as oil prices fell and bank stocks tumbled. But while financials remained weak, the S&P 500 and other key index closed with slim losses, capping a solid tech-led month of May. S&P 500 and Dow industrials futures rose more than 0.1% vs. fair value Thursday morning while Nasdaq 100 futures climbed climbed 0.3%. Futures briefly pared most of their gains following the private-sector Caixin survey that showed Chinese manufacturing activity contracting for the first time in nearly a year. That follows slow-but-steady growth from official government data, out earlier in the week, that focuses more on state-owned enterprises. China's Shanghai composite slid 0.5% Thursday intraday. Japan's Nikkei advanced 1.1% as the yen weakened. IBD'S TAKE: Chinese regulators, worried about soaring credit growth, are starting to crack down, having an impact on the world's No. 2 economy in short order. That's the focus of our latest cover story: "Here's Why China's Latest Growth Scare Should Worry You." Analog Devices Analog shares rose 2.4% to 84.80 on Tuesday, just moving beyond an 84.34 buy point. On Wednesday, the Apple iPhone supplier shares shot up as high as 90.49, but closed at 85.76, just a 1.1% gain and near session lows. That's not great action, and investors should be cautious. However, shares are well within the 5% chase zone from the entry point. What sparked Wednesday's big move? Analog Devices reported strong earnings and bullish guidance before the market open, though revenue was essentially in line. Analog Devices has been touted as a likely big winner from the upcoming Apple iPhone 8, due out later this year. As for Apple itself, shares dipped 0.6% on Wednesday, continuing to trade tightly over the last few weeks, close to record highs. Apple does not have a potential buy point current after a long run. Analog Devices has a best-possible 99 Composite Rating, which means it outperforms 99% of all stocks based on a variety of IBD proprietary fundamental and technical data. Big-time winners tend to have Composite Ratings of 95 or more near the start of their runs. Paylocity Paylocity, the lone non-chipmaker highlighted here, is a cloud-based human resources software firm. Paylocity cleared a 45.71 buy point from a cup-with-handle pattern on May 25, and shares have remained above the entry since then. Shares fell intraday Wednesday but closed up 0.2% to 46.85. Other cloud-based HR software peers include Paycom (PAYC) and Workday (WDAY). Paycom has been hovering around a three-weeks-tight follow-on buy point, while Workday is modestly extended from a breakout. Workday, which competes against Oracle (ORCL) and SAP (SAP), is expected to report a 220% EPS gain late Thursday. Paylocity has a 97 Composite Rating. Micron Technology The memory chipmaker cleared a 29.97 flat base buy point on Tuesday, then edged up 0.2% to 30.77 on Wednesday, still well within buy range. Industry demand and pricing is strong, boosting profits of other memory chip players such as Samsung Electronics and Western Digital (WDC). Micron's CR Rating is an 89, reflecting a poor run of earnings until recently. Memory chip makers' fortunes tend to be highly cyclical, so stocks often start to move on indications of improving industry fundamentals before big earnings come in. Micron is reporting strong results now. Marvell Technology Marvell cleared a 16.82 buy point on May 25, then reported strong earnings after the closing bell that session. The next day, shares popped to just out of buying range, but shares have come back modestly this week to 17.24 on Wednesday. Marvell has a 92 Composite Rating.

Could the long-rumored iPad Pro 2 or Siri Speaker be in attendance? It’s very possible. Read on for a full guide to everything that we might see when WWDC 2017 kicks off on June 5 at the McEnery Convention Center in San Jose. Cut to the chase What is it? Apple's software-focused conference When is it? June 5 - June 9 2017 iOS 11 While many things are rumored for WWDC 2017, iOS 11 will almost certainly be shown off. Rumored highlights of the new version include lots of upgrades to Siri, focused on making it learn your habits and respond to questions faster. We’re also hearing that Apple Pay could get an upgrade, allowing for peer-to-peer payments, while FaceTime audio calls could become the default when calling someone else who uses an iPhone, so you don’t eat into your minutes. Apple might also launch a sleep tracking app with iOS 11, plus, Apple Clips could get more features, low-power mode could get better by learning your habits and location, a Dark Mode could be added, and communications may even be consolidated into a single menu – so you can see emails, SMS messages and social network communications with a given person all in one place. Not only will iOS 11 probably be announced at WWDC, but you’ll even likely be able to grab a beta version of it – though the final, finished version probably won’t arrive until mid-September. Here's everything we expect to see on iOS 11 watchOS 4 As well as a new version of iOS, Apple might also launch a new watchOS, specifically watchOS 4. Not much is known about what this will bring yet, but given that Apple has bought a company that makes sleep trackers there’s a good chance a sleep tracking feature will be added to watchOS. We also might see the ability to track more activities, with skiing and snowboarding being tested according to Gizmodo. iPad Pro 2 While software is usually the focus of WWDC, we do sometimes get major hardware announcements too, and this year the iPad Pro 2 could be the headline announcement. There’s not a huge amount of evidence that we’ll see it at WWDC 2017, but it’s clearly in the works, and respected analyst Ming-Chi Kuo reckons there’s around a 70% chance of a 10.5-inch iPad Pro 2 showing up. That’s one of two or three iPad Pro 2 models that we’re ultimately expecting to see, and along with the new screen size it’s rumored to have a powerful new A10X chipset, a bigger battery and a new and improved Apple Pencil. Here's what we know so far about the iPad Pro 2 iPhone SE 2 Although the iPhone 8 probably won’t land until September, the iPhone SE 2 might arrive at WWDC. If and when it does launch, it’s likely to replace the original iPhone SE as Apple’s most affordable handset but with a very different design, complete with an all-glass back. Not much else has been rumored about the iPhone SE 2 yet though, which makes us doubt a WWDC unveiling is actually on the cards. Here's everything we know about the iPhone SE 2 MacBooks Not one but three new MacBook models are rumored to be arriving at WWDC 2017, with the MacBook Pro, MacBook Air and 12-inch MacBook all potentially getting refreshed. But refresh is the key word, as sources suggest that while the specs will be getting a bump, there won’t be much change to the design or features. Apparently, the new MacBook Pro will house the latest Intel Core i processor series, with the 12-inch MacBook being similarly spec’d. Siri Speaker Apple is heavily rumored to be working on a Siri-powered smart speaker, designed to compete with the Amazon Echo and Google Home, and one analyst reckons there’s a 50% chance we’ll see it at WWDC 2017. The Siri Speaker (which probably won’t launch under that name), is rumored to have some kind of touch panel, and potentially even a built-in camera, perhaps so that it can recognize users. It may even be able to sense emotions – though we’re not yet sure what it would do with that ability. Apple TV and tvOS We wouldn’t count on seeing a new Apple TV at WWDC 2017, but it’s possible and could well come with support for 4K and HDR content. Whether or not a 5th gen Apple TV lands we might see a new version of tvOS. This might sport better Siri integration and come with more and better content. macOS Finally on the software front, a new version of macOS is likely to be announced at WWDC 2017. It hasn’t been officially named yet, but it will probably be version 10.13. Nothing is really known about it yet, and while it might well be previewed at WWDC, a final release probably won’t land until later in the year.

Soon, a device embossed with “Designed by Apple in California” may be on your nightstand or kitchen counter as well. The iPhone-maker has started manufacturing a long-in-the-works Siri-controlled smart speaker, according to people familiar with the matter. Apple could debut the speaker as soon as its annual developer conference in June, but the device will not be ready to ship until later in the year, the people said.  The device will differ from Amazon.com Inc.’s Echo and Alphabet Inc.’s Google Home speakers by offering virtual surround sound technology and deep integration with Apple’s product lineup, said the people, who requested anonymity to discuss products that aren’t yet public. Introducing a speaker would serve two main purposes: providing a hub to automate appliances and lights via Apple’s HomeKit system, and establishing a bulwark inside the home to lock customers more tightly into Apple’s network of services. That would help combat the competitive threat from Google’s and Amazon’s connected speakers: the Home and Echo mostly don’t support services from Apple. Without compatible hardware, users may be more likely to opt for the Echo or Home, and therefore use streaming music offerings such as Spotify, Amazon Prime Music or Google Play rather than Apple Music. “This will be a platform for developing Apple’s services,” says Gene Munster, a co-founder of Loup Ventures and former Apple analyst. Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller declined to comment. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook has emphasized Apple’s services businesses over the past 18 months as iPhone sales slowed. He expects service revenue to double by 2020 from last year’s $24 billion. A speaker may help keep customers loyal to service products such as Apple Music, a subscription music streaming offering that costs $10 per month. The speaker would likely be tucked into Apple’s “Other Products” category, which currently includes devices like the Apple Watch, Apple TV and AirPods. That set of products generated $11 billion in sales last year. Inventec Corp., the Taipei manufacturer that already makes the AirPod wireless headphones, will add the speaker to its Apple repertoire, the people said. Apple employees have been secretly testing the device in their homes for several months, they said. The Siri speaker reached an advanced prototype stage late last year, Bloomberg News reported at the time. An Inventec representative didn’t respond to a request for comment outside normal business hours in Taiwan. This year’s developers conference will be the first since 2013 to introduce new hardware. Apple could announce updated iPad tablets at the conference, one of the people said. Apple last updated the 9.7-inch iPad Pro in March 2016 and hasn’t refreshed the larger 12.9-inch model since its November 2015 debut. Planned Mac updates will include refreshed versions of the MacBook and MacBook Pro with faster Intel Corp. processors, Bloomberg News reported earlier this month. Apple hopes that more advanced acoustics technology will give the speaker an edge over competitors, according to people with knowledge of the product’s development. Along with generating virtual surround sound, the speakers being tested are louder and reproduce sound more crisply than rival offerings, the people said. Apple has also considered including sensors that measure a room’s acoustics and automatically adjust audio levels during use, one of the people said. Apple will also likely let third-party services build products for the speaker. Last year, Apple opened up Siri on the iPhone to the likes of Uber Technologies Inc. and Facebook Inc., allowing a user to order a ride or send a WhatsApp message with a voice command. The device will be a hub for Apple’s HomeKit home automation system, letting users control devices such as lights, door locks and window blinds. At present, an Apple TV or iPad is required to control that equipment from outside the home or automatically. The Echo and Google Home both support third-party services and smart home appliances. Ahead of Apple’s launch, the competition has upgraded their speakers with support for making voice calls, while Amazon’s gained a touchscreen. Apple’s speaker won’t include such a screen, according to people who have seen the product. The most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter. Sign Up An Apple-designed speaker with high-end sound quality that fits perfectly into the Apple ecosystem is a familiar pitch. In 2006, Apple unveiled the iPod Hi-Fi, a battery powered speaker designed to cast a shadow over the thriving iPod third-party accessory market. With its bulky size and high price point, the Hi-Fi flopped and was discontinued within 18 months of launching. With Siri and a clear hole in its ecosystem, Apple is banking that its second try at a speaker product will do better.

After your motherboard and CPU, the next crucial component to consider is your graphics card. Let’s go over the five best Hackintosh graphics cards. Choosing from the available Hackintosh graphics cards is tricky, but we take the pain out of it for you What’s the Big Deal About Hackintosh Graphics Cards? This is a tricky decision, because you have to worry about what’s going to perform best at a good price. When looking at Hackintosh graphics cards, you also have to worry about what’s fully supported and what isn’t. Apple tends to favor Nvida graphics chipsets, but only certain ones. Luckily, Nvidia has begun releasing its own drivers for macOS, and you can even utilize up to three Nvidia cards at a time. So, with that in mind, let’s go over the top choices to choose from. You might be asking why all of the Hackintosh graphics cards listed here are Nvidia. The reason is simple: Nvidia is what Apple is using the most now. Other chipsets are supported, such as AMD’s ATI Radeon, but they have serious compatibility issues on a Hackintosh. Even though Apple has included support out of the box for nearly every relevant AMD graphics chipset out there, recent versions of the operating system need further hacks to work properly. These problems, and others, are why I’ve focused on Nvidia. If you prefer AMD Radeon for your graphics, TonyMacX86 does an excellent job of offering workarounds for the majority of the issues. What is CUDA? Here’s another reason I’ve focused on Nvidia cards for a Hackintosh: CUDA. CUDA is: a parallel computing platform and programming model invented by NVIDIA. It enables dramatic increases in computing performance by harnessing the power of the graphics processing unit (GPU). With millions of CUDA-enabled GPUs sold to date, software developers, scientists and researchers are using GPU-accelerated computing for broad-ranging applications. In other words, this allows your graphics card to handle much of the work your CPU would otherwise have to do for mathematical and other computations, speeding things up considerably. EVGA GeForce GTX Titan Superclocked First, we have the EVGA GeForce GTX Titan Superclocked gaming card. This video card is a dual-slot add-on to your build, so make sure you have the room for it. It’s definitely worth the room and the cost, simply because of what it offers you. This card uses Nvidia’s Maxwell architecture, and is capable of resolutions of 4K and beyond. It’s also virtual-reality ready, so it’s got to be powerful. This graphics card has 12GB of DDR5 RAM, and a clock speed of 1127MHz. It provides 3,072 CUDA cores for processing mathematical computations with the GPU instead of your CPU. Also, output ports are there for all of your display needs: HDMI, DisplayPort X3, and DVI. The only real downfall to this card is the price—$1,699 on Amazon—but it’s well-worth the investment if you can include it in your build budget.

I also think that the higher end Maxwell GPU’s are also great in a Hackintosh. My best one that my son now uses was a GTX 980. I also would look at the used market as gaming cards get turned over quite a bit and you can find bargains on used older generation cards from people upgrading their gaming rigs. There is one thing I would mention is Mac People are not used to having to worry about the power supply and the power consumption of the GPU. Be careful that you have sufficient power to the GPU Thank you so much for writing this. –Rick– May 31, 2017 at 4:27 EDT PM Jeff Butts May 31, 2017 Thanks, Rick! The last card in the list is actually a real budget buy. I think the current price on Amazon is only around $120. May 31, 2017 at 5:41 EDT PM Add a Comment Click here to cancel reply.

Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman reported that Apple has begun manufacturing the device, with Taiwan’s Inventec being that manufacturer. Apple’s Siri Speaker (an unofficial name) would have surround sound, integration with Apple devices, and no touch screen. The first two would set it apart from Alexa and Home, while the third might be surprising. Voice Control Touch Screens Apple senior vice president Phil Schiller said earlier in May that voice-control devices often need a screen. Many interpreted that as an indication that Apple was planning to introduce its long-awaited entry to the home automation control market with a device that had a display. And right on cue, Amazon announced the exceedingly ugly Amazon Echo Show, an Alexa-powered speaker with a touch screen. But, Mark Gurman reported that, “Apple’s speaker won’t include such a screen, according to people who have seen the product.” Reading the tea leaves, I suspect that means Apple’s Siri Speaker will be able to display information on your Apple TV or iOS device. That would be classic misdirection from an Apple executive on what the company is working on. Pony Up Meanwhile, there’s that surround sound tidbit. Eagles to bagels says Siri Speaker won’t be cheap like Amazon’s Dot ($49.99), Google Home ($129.99) and maybe not even like the original Echo. It will, however, sound better, which isn’t a high bar to meet. Other tidbits from the report include the reality that Apple has been working on this product for a long time. The company has also considered including sensors in the device that would allow it to tune itself to whatever room it’s in. It’s unclear if that’s actually in the works or was discarded. Apple’s Siri Speaker Is Happening While the device is being manufactured, it won’t ship until later this year. Whether it will be shown at June’s World Wide Developer Conference (WWDC) is also unclear, but I’ve got fingers crossed. If Apple is committed to shipping it, a great Siri Speaker pre-announcement would fire up Apple’s developers and fans alike, and blunt the momentum of the other devices out there. One way or another, I’m now at 100% on this product’s existence. The Siri Speaker rumor mill has critical mass and enough details to have reached viability.

Skip to content comics cosplay tv/film games Submit tip Contact CGC Insider Search for: Home > Games > Nintendo vs. Apple: The Battle For Spare Parts Nintendo vs. Apple: The Battle For Spare Parts Posted by Gavin Sheehan May 31, 2017 Comment That headline may sound funny, but it’s no laughing matter as Apple and Nintendo are currently at odds with each other on the production side of things. After the Switch became a hit, Nintendo has shifted focus to ramp up production and create more units to ship out. Unfortunately, some of the parts they need are also used by Apple for their iPhones, and according to a few different sources online (WSJ and Game Rant), there’s just not enough to go around. The crux of the matter is that Apple and other companies that make mobile devices are better positioned to make better deals with manufacturers when it comes to getting their money’s worth. That’s a battle for needed parts that Nintendo just can’t win, so rather than being able to skip to the front of the line because they have the new hotness on the market, they’re stuck in line with everyone else. It’s not like Nintendo hasn’t faced this hurdle before when it came to producing the 3DS and the Wii U, but back then there wasn’t as high a demand for either system like there is now for the Switch, which puts the company in a weird spot as they try to supply that demand. While it may not be a great concern at the moment, it’s going to become one very quickly once the Splatoon version is released, and will only continue to grow as we slowly march toward the holiday season. Nintendo has already made fans irate over the cancellation of the NES Classic Edition, which people were waiting to give Nintendo money hand over fist for. What will happen come fall if Nintendo clearly won’t have enough to appease everyone who said to themselves “I’ll just wait until December” back in March?

According to information obtained by French website, Consomac, Apple has registered new model numbers with the Eurasian Economic Commission. The assumption is that these numbers coincide with new Macs and new iPads being announced at WWDC next week. Russia requires companies to register all new products that utilise encryption tools. Five model numbers (A1289, A1347, A1418, A1419 and A1481) belong to products running macOS 10.12, possibly a 13- and 15-inch MacBook Pro, a 12-inch MacBook and perhaps a refreshed MacBook Air. However, MacRumors pointed out that these numbers don’t have the same AXX prefixes for current MacBook models. In addition, Apple registered four model numbers (A1671, A1709, A1670 and A1701) that corresponded to iOS 10 devices. This seems to corroborate the rumoured launch of the new 10.5-inch iPad Pro next week. Consomac also discovered a model number (A1843) belonging to a spare part for the Mac, which could possibly be a new wireless keyboard. The story behind the story: This is not the first time that we’ve heard evidence of potential new hardware coming out of WWDC. Bloomberg originally suggested that Apple was gearing up to launch three new laptops: A MacBook Pro sporting Intel’s Kaby Lake processor, a 12-inch MacBook with a faster CPU and a 13-inch MacBook Air. We’ve heard reliable information about new iOS devices, as well. KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo told his clients to expect a new 10.5-inch iPad Pro model to complement the current 9.7-inch and the 12.9-inch models Related Tags:  Share: Comments Related Posts Random Posts Buzz Contacts Logging into apps with Facebook just got less creepy Skype for Mac updated How to capture a sense of speed with panning Microsoft’s anti-iPad marketing revealed Leave a Comment Click here to cancel reply.

_ Macworld Australia MAC iPad iPhone iSnap App Guide Gadget Guide mResell HOME NEWS FEATURES REVIEWS HELP/TIPS BLOGS Mac In Business Communications Productivity Security Workflow FORUM MAGAZINE Digital Subscription Current Issue Back Issues Report: Apple’s screen-less Siri Speaker is now in production and could debut at WWDC Oscar Raymundo 1 June, 2017 View more articles fromthe author AAA Comments News By the end of the year, Apple will have a Siri Speaker to compete against Amazon Echo and Google Home. According to a new report from Bloomberg, Apple has started overseas production of its Siri-enabled smart speaker. Apple could unveil this highly-anticipated Siri Speaker onstage during the WWDC keynote taking place on Monday 5 June, but the all-new device won’t be ready to ship until later this year. The Siri Speaker has been designed to compete against the Amazon Echo and Google Home. To differentiate itself from those other products, the Apple smart speaker will boast virtual surround sound and will be seamlessly integrated with Apple products and services, like Apple Music. In addition, the Siri Speaker will give Apple users a new hub for controlling HomeKit-enabled devices around their home. Bloomberg also revealed that Apple won’t integrate a screen in its first iteration of the Siri Speaker. Earlier this month, Apple’s senior vice president of marketing Phil Schiller said that he wasn’t a fan of Amazon Echo or Google Home because they lacked screens. Days later, Amazon introduced Echo Show, a version of its flagship smart speaker with a touchscreen. The Siri Speaker is being produced by Inventec, the Taipei-based manufacturer already responsible for making the wireless AirPods. According to Bloomberg, the Siri Speaker has been in development for a long time, reaching the advanced prototype stage late last year. For several months now, Apple employees have been secretly testing the device in their own homes. Why this matters: Apple is banking on a smart speaker with superior sound quality and deeper ties to the Apple ecosystem. Those two features seem certain, given the Beats ownership and the new W1 chip that can pair devices seamlessly. In addition, the Siri Speaker could include sensors to measure indoor acoustics and automatically adjust audio levels. But will that be enough to make the Siri Speaker a must-have? Amazon is already ahead in bringing third-party apps to its Alexa-powered Echo devices, even Apple services like iCloud calendar are being brought to the fold. Meanwhile, Google has recently made its AI assistant available on iOS, pointing out some serious Siri fails. And HomeKit devices can already be operated using an iPhone, iPad or Apple TV.

According to Business Insider, the state-controlled tech industry of the country has previously produced iMac and iPhone knock-offs. Also, the state’s official operating system, Red Star OS, is a version of Linux that looks a lot like macOS. It had originally copied the Windows 7 UI but gave it a Mac-like look a few years ago. While imitation may be akin to flattery, the regime’s latest knock-off is blatant trademark infringement. Myohyang IT has just unveiled its newest tablet called the "iPad." Well, officially it is the Ryonghung iPad, but still, “i” + “Pad” = Apple trademark. While it may share the name, the tablet is anything but an ineffectual attempt to mimic Apple’s brand and the specs prove it. Here are the tablet's specifications compared to the latest version of the Apple iPad in parenthesis: 1 GHz CPU (1.8 GHz) 512 MB RAM (2 GB) 8 GB internal memory (32/64 GB) 16 GB external memory (N/A; actually, up to whatever capacity you can AirDrop to) 8-inch display; resolution unknown (9.7-inch, 2048x1536) The only category that the Ryonghung iPad beats its namesake is in weight. At 250 grams, the Korean copycat weighs about half that of a real thing (478g). Ironically, North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un praised his country's IT manufacturers for their "creative ingenuity" when they duplicated an iPhone in 2014. So far, Apple has not commented on this glaring infringement. Being that trade embargoes cut North Korea off from the rest of the world, it is not likely that the device will even escape the country. Other than as a novelty, it does not seem to pose any threat to Apple. So legal actions, if even possible or enforceable over there, are probably not worth the effort.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « A Major Roundup of the Latest Samsung Smartphone Designs from the U.S Patent Office | Main May 31, 2017 News of Inventec Winning the Contract for Apple's version of a Home Speaker Device with Siri Resurfaces   On May 3, 2017, Patently Apple posted a report titled "Inventec Lands First Order for Apple's Echo-Like Home Device with Siri." Now all of a sudden Bloomberg wakes up to tell us the big scoop that we already knew for almost a month. Yet the Bloomberg report did add that "Apple hopes that more advanced acoustics technology will give the speaker an edge over competitors, according to people with knowledge of the product’s development. Along with generating virtual surround sound, the speakers being tested are louder and reproduce sound more crisply than rival offerings, the people said. Apple has also considered including sensors that measure a room’s acoustics and automatically adjust audio levels during use, one of the people said." That could be referring to Apple's latest audio invention. You could read the full Bloomberg report here.   Earlier today Patently Apple reported that HP is going to debut a home speaker device this fall with Microsoft's Cortana. The report also illustrated that Samsung is working on a similar idea and that in general, the AI wars are reaching a fever pitch level with all major device makers jumping on the speaker device trend that could be the heart of any future smart home system.   Even start-up Essential Products that's run by former Google Executive Andy Rubin introduced a home hub speaker device with a unique 5" round display ahead of Apple. Ouch.   We can only hope that Apple, almost being last to the party, can deliver a superior home device with clear cut advantages and not just a me-too product. Will Jony Ive deliver? Only time will tell.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

We've already heard that it will unveil a revamped MacBook lineup, a new iPad Pro, and the oft-rumored smart speaker with Siri built-in on that occasion. Today a new report says the Siri speaker has entered production, following a very long development period. The information allegedly comes from unnamed "people familiar with the matter". Once again it's revealed that an official debut at WWDC is likely, but even if it does get presented on June 5 the speaker will only start shipping "later in the year". Unlike Amazon's Echo line of smart speakers and Google's Home, the Siri device will offer "virtual surround sound" and, of course, deep integration with Apple's other products and services. That's kind of the point, since Apple feels that if it doesn't step into this nascent market people who have other Apple devices will choose to buy an Amazon Echo or Google Home, and thus use services such as Prime Music or Play Music on those speakers. With its own smart speaker, it can ensure that Apple Music customers remain loyal. The device will be manufactured by Inventec, the same company making the AirPod wireless headphones. Apple employees have been testing the speaker in their homes for several months now. It's said to feature better sound than its competitors, and it's also louder. Apple has reportedly considered adding sensors that measure a room's acoustics and can automatically adjust audio levels during use, but it's unclear if those will be in the final product. It's likely that Apple will let third parties develop services for the speaker, just like Google and Amazon. The Siri speaker will also serve as a hub for HomeKit, being able to control lights, door locks, window blinds, smart home appliances. The device will not have a screen, unlike the recently unveiled Amazon Echo Show.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 1 June 2017 by Maciej Heyman Apple Reports Second Quarter Results CUPERTINO, California — May 2, 2017 — Apple today announced financial results for its fiscal 2017 second quarter ended April 1, 2017. The Company posted quarterly revenue of $52.9 billion and quarterly earnings per diluted share of $2.10. These results compare to revenue of $50.6 billion and earnings per diluted share of $1.90 in the year-ago quarter. International sales accounted for 65 percent of the quarter’s revenue. “We are proud to report a strong March quarter, with revenue growth accelerating from the December quarter and continued robust demand for iPhone 7 Plus,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “We’ve seen great customer response to both models of the new iPhone 7 (PRODUCT)RED Special Edition and we’re thrilled with the strong momentum of our Services business, with our highest revenue ever for a 13-week quarter. Looking ahead, we are excited to welcome attendees from around the world to our annual Worldwide Developers Conference next month in San Jose.” Apple also announced that its Board of Directors has authorized an increase of $50 billion to the Company’s program to return capital to shareholders and is extending the program timeframe by four quarters.  Under the expanded program, Apple plans to spend a cumulative total of $300 billion by the end of March 2019. “We generated strong operating cash flow of $12.5 billion and returned over $10 billion to our investors in the March quarter,” said Luca Maestri, Apple’s CFO. “Given the strength of our business and our confidence in our future, we are happy to announce another $50 billion increase to our capital return program today.” As part of the latest update to the program, the Board has increased its share repurchase authorization to $210 billion from the $175 billion level announced a year ago. The Company also expects to continue to net-share-settle vesting restricted stock units. The Board has approved a 10.5% increase to the Company’s quarterly dividend, and has declared a dividend of $0.63 per share of the Company’s common stock, payable on May 18, 2017 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on May 15, 2017. From the inception of its capital return program in August 2012 through March 2017, Apple has returned over $211 billion to shareholders, including $151 billion in share repurchases. The Company plans to continue to access the domestic and international debt markets to assist in funding the program. The management team and the Board will continue to review each element of the capital return program regularly and plan to provide an update on the program on an annual basis. Apple is providing the following guidance for its fiscal 2017 third quarter:   revenue between $43.5 billion and $45.5 billion gross margin between 37.5 percent and 38.5 percent operating expenses between $6.6 billion and $6.7 billion other income/(expense) of $450 million tax rate of 25.5 percent Apple will provide live streaming of its Q2 2017 financial results conference call beginning at 2:00 p.m. PDT on May 2, 2017 at www.apple.com/investor/earnings-call/.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 1 June 2017 by Maciej Heyman Nokia and Apple sign agreement, settle all litigation Cupertino, California and Espoo, Finland — Nokia and Apple announced today that they have settled all litigation related to their intellectual property dispute and agreed a multi-year patent license. “This is a meaningful agreement between Nokia and Apple,” said Maria Varsellona, Chief Legal Officer at Nokia, responsible for Nokia’s patent licensing business. “It moves our relationship with Apple from being adversaries in court to business partners working for the benefit of our customers.” Under a business collaboration agreement, Nokia will be providing certain network infrastructure product and services to Apple. Apple will resume carrying Nokia digital health products (formerly under the Withings brand) in Apple retail and online stores, and Apple and Nokia are exploring future collaboration in digital health initiatives. Regular summits between top Nokia and Apple executives will ensure that the relationship works effectively and to the benefit of both parties and their customers. “We are pleased with this resolution of our dispute and we look forward to expanding our business relationship with Nokia,” said Jeff Williams, Apple’s chief operating officer. “This agreement will strengthen our collaboration,” said Basil Alwan, President of Nokia’s IP/Optical Networks business. “We look forward to supporting Apple.” While details of the agreement remain confidential, Nokia will receive an up-front cash payment from Apple, with additional revenues during the term of the agreement. The value of the agreement will be reflected partially as patent licensing net sales in Nokia Technologies and partially as net sales in other Nokia business groups. Nokia will follow its existing practices for disclosing patent licensing revenue in its quarterly announcements and expects that revenues for the agreement will start to be recognized in the second quarter of 2017, including an element of non-recurring catch-up revenue. Due to the up-front cash payment from Apple, Nokia intends to provide a comprehensive update of its capital structure optimization program in conjunction with its third quarter 2017 results. Apple revolutionized personal technology with the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984. Today, Apple leads the world in innovation with iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch and Apple TV. Apple’s four software platforms — iOS, macOS, watchOS and tvOS — provide seamless experiences across all Apple devices and empower people with breakthrough services including the App Store, Apple Music, Apple Pay and iCloud. Apple’s more than 100,000 employees are dedicated to making the best products on earth, and to leaving the world better than we found it.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 1 June 2017 by Maciej Heyman Here’s Why Apple Stock Has Been Crushing the S&amp;P 500 This Year Shutterstock photo While it never seems to leave the spotlight for too long, Apple AAPL is currently hogging the attention of investors around the world as we prepare for the company’s annual Worldwide Developers Conference next week. Speculation about what Apple might announce at the latest WWDC is abound, but it seems likely that we will see some form of Siri-based home assistant device, as well as the debut of iOS 11. And as the anticipation of these announcements continues to ramp up, now seems like a good time to reflect on Apple’s insane stock performance so far this year. It wasn’t long ago that were talking about Apple „losing its magic” after the company posted its first annual sales decline since 2001, but the stock has significantly outpaced the S&P 500 recently, leaving many investors to wonder how exactly Apple got its groove back. Of course, we all know that AAPL has been one of the most incredible stocks to own over the years. Thanks in no small part to the genius of co-founder and longtime CEO Steve Jobs, the company was able to consistently deliver value to shareholders-at the same time that it was revolutionizing consumer electronics. But things start changing after the passing of Jobs, and the story took a major turn last year when sales of Apple’s marquee product, the iPhone, started slipping for the first time. For much of 2016, the stock barely kept pace with the S&P 500, a benchmark that Apple investors had grown accustom to crushing. Apple shares ended the year up about 12.15%, meagerly ahead of the S&P’s 11.96% gain. Nevertheless, things have changed quickly yet again. So far this year, AAPL has soared more than 33%, while the S&P 500 has gained just less than 9%. So what happened? Well, Apple’s rebound really started earlier this year when the company reported the results of its holiday quarter. iPhone sales are always the key to Apple’s reports, as the product accounts for roughly 60% of its total revenue, and the December quarter-which saw Apple post 5% growth in this segment-broke a streak of three-straight periods of iPhone sales declines. Another encouraging aspect of this report was the growth of Apple’s Services unit, which includes things like Apple Care, Apple Pay, Apple Music, and the App Store. The company marked Services growth of 18% in the first fiscal quarter, and it was able to maintain that growth rate in its latest quarterly report as well. Interestingly, Apple’s second-quarter report marked a return to iPhone sales declines. Unit sales slipped 1% year-over-year to 50.8 million, which missed our consensus estimate of 51.2 million and continued the sharp decline from 2015’s peak of 61.2 million. But none of this really gets to the root of why Apple has been on such a roll. No, in my view, Apple’s recent performance has nothing to do with its results; instead, it has everything to do with anticipation. As mentioned, this year’s WWDC is garnering a lot of buzz, and it seems like it will be a monumental moment for the company to display some of the work it has been doing in the worlds of AI and IoT. Some analysts have also murmured about a possible MacBook upgrade. What’s more, this year is the ten-year anniversary of the iPhone. Whether it be the iPhone 8, a combination of the 7s models + the iPhone 8 later in the year, or even a special iPhone X edition, we can rest assured that a monumental new phone is coming soon. This effect is two-fold. First of all, it lightens the relevancy of the 1% drop in iPhone sales in the most recent quarter. We can easily blame that slump on people holding out for the next announcement. Also, we can see that investors think the iPhone 8 is going to be huge, as the stock has been moving with every rumor and leak that spills out. So far, it seems like the next iPhone will have an all-glass body, an edge-to-edge display, no home button, wireless charging, and new OLED technologies. Tack this anticipation onto the overall strength of the technology sector, as well as Wall Street’s hopes for corporate tax reform, and it’s easy to see why Apple shares are soaring. Let’s just hope Apple can live up to the expectations. Want more stock market analysis from this author? Make sure to follow @ Ryan_McQueeney on Twitter!

Follow @pinknews News News Home UK US World Trans Politics Education Law Religion Business Entertainment Trans Opinion Travel Life Life Home Health Sport About Advertise Contact Privacy RSS Search Home UK US World Current Affairs Entertainment Opinion Travel Features Trans US Tech giants warn Texas over anti-trans bathroom law Elena Cherubini, PinkNews 31st May 2017, 2:48 PM Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook CEO, also signed the letter against the "bathroom bill" (David Ramos/Getty Images) Google, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon and others urged Texas to not adopt a “discriminatory” anti-trans “bathroom bill”. If approved by the Governor, anti-LGBT legislation in Texas would require transgender people to only use public bathrooms corresponding with their sex at birth. The tech companies have lobbied against the proposal and have wrote a letter to Texas Governor Greg Abbot demanding him to stop pursuing the bill. Governor Greg Abbott may to call for a special legislative session to pass the bathroom bill The letter was signed by the CEOs of Amazon, Facebook, IBM, Apple, Microsoft, Gearbox Software, Google, Celanese Corporation, Salesforce, Cisco, GSD&M, Silicon Labs, Dell Technologies and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HP). The CEOs wrote: “We are writing to express our steadfast opposition to the introduction and passage of any discriminatory legislation in Texas. “Such laws are bad for our employees and bad for business.” Since Texas has a unique political system, the state legislature only meets every two years for a period of maximum 140 days. The state legislature ended this Monday and a partial version of the bill, limited to students in public schools, was passed by lawmakers. However, now that the session has been adjourned there’s talk that the Gvoernor may call for a special legislative session to pass a broader anti-trans bill. Abbott has insisted that passing the bathroom bill was his “top priority”. “As large employers in the state, we are gravely concerned that any such legislation would deeply tarnish Texas’ reputation as open and friendly to businesses and families,” the letter continues. “Discrimination is wrong and it has no place in Texas or anywhere in our country.” The ending of the letter clearly states the opposition of the tech companies for the bill. “We strongly urge you and the Texas legislature not to further pursue legislation of this kind.” North Carolina,the only state in the US that had a “bathroom bill” in place, repealed it earlier this year, but the decision sparked controversy as the partial-repeal left some discriminatory policies in place. Governors in Arkansas, Kentucky, and South Dakota have rejected this type of law. Earlier this month Texas passed a bill that allows adoption agencies to discriminate against LGBT people. The same legislature also passed a bill banning ban transgender athletes from competing. 0 reader comments Share on Facebook Share on Twitter More like this What is a gender-neutral bathroom?

While WWDC is typically a software-only affair, rumor has it that Apple at WWDC this year will have a slew of hardware announcements. In addition to a brand new edgeless 10.5-inch iPad and a refreshed MacBook line, there are rumblings that Apple will introduce a Siri-based speaker next week at WWDC. Don't Miss: Aerospace exec says aliens not only exist, they’re living on Earth right now According to reports which surfaced over the past few weeks, Apple’s Siri-based speaker will compete with Google Home and Amazon’s Echo. Feature wise, the product will reportedly incorporate Beats audio technology and will offer users a premium acoustic experience. As for how Apple’s offering might differ from existing smart speakers already on the market, there are rumblings that the device will feature a touchscreen, a design that Apple executive Phil Schiller arguably confirmed just earlier this month during an interview. “So there’s many moments where a voice assistant is really beneficial, but that doesn’t mean you’d never want a screen,” Schiller said a few weeks back. “So the idea of not having a screen, I don’t think suits many situations.” Additionally, a new Bloomberg report sheds some more light on how Apple may carve out space for itself in a market currently dominated by Google and Amazon. Specifically, the report relays that Apple’s Siri speaker will feature virtual surround sound technology and will be tightly integrated with the entirety of Apple’s ecosystem. Apple hopes that more advanced acoustics technology will give the speaker an edge over competitors, according to people with knowledge of the product’s development. Along with generating virtual surround sound, the speakers being tested are louder and reproduce sound more crisply than rival offerings, the people said. Apple has also considered including sensors that measure a room’s acoustics and automatically adjust audio levels during use, one of the people said. This is all very intriguing, but it remains to be seen if the acoustic features Apple might deliver will prove to be enough of a draw for users who might reasonably prioritize functionality over premium acoustics. In other words, a top of the line acoustic experience might be an altogether moot point if Siri performance can’t keep pace with what Amazon and Google are able to deliver. The upside, though, is that a Siri speaker will be able to incorporate larger and more advanced microphones which should help processing. What’s more, there are rumors that Apple at WWDC this year will introduce an enhanced version of Siri. On a related note, Apple is supposedly working on its own neural network that will reportedly help bolster Siri’s artificial intelligence capabilities significantly. With WWDC set to kick off this coming Monday, we won’t have to wait too much longer to find out.

Apple plans to go after both Amazon Echo and Google Home with its own assistant-enabled speaker. There have been several leaks and reports about this unconfirmed device, which you can read all about here in Pocket-lint's round-up, but strangely, we've yet to see any images of it leak out through the press. Nevertheless, Bloomberg said it is still coming and that Apple has started manufacturing it. Most people think it could be announced at WWDC 2017, Apple's annual developers conference that kicks off in June. But if it's only now entering production, don't expect to buy one right off. Apparently, the speaker "will not be ready" to ship until later in the year, but it'll be louder and better-sounding than the existing competition, as it will offer up a "virtual surround sound" - whatever that means. We're thinking it can just fill a room with sound, like 360-degree speakers do. Apple reportedly has also mulled the idea of including sensors that auto-adjust sound levels based on room noise, which means it might be able to lower music if you're talking, but that's not confirmed. It would also integrate with Apple's ecosystem, so you should be able to control HomeKit-capable smart home devices. Curved OLED iPhone 8 confirmed by Samsung? Apple will officially test its self-driving tech on this car in California Apple and Nike made a new Apple Watch called NikeLab and it's limited If it does work with third-party services as well, then we should definitely hear something about it at WWDC, because that would give developers time to offer support before the speaker launches. Although WWDC doesn't usually include hardware, there are other reports claiming that Apple may use the show to update its Mac and iPad lineups. Check out our WWDC guide for more details on that.

Apple has started manufacturing a long-in-the-works Siri-controlled smart speaker, according to people familiar with the matter. The Cupertino company could debut the speaker as soon as its annual developer conference in June, but the device will not be ready to ship until later in the year, the people said. The device will differ from Amazon.com’s Echo and Google’s Home speakers by offering virtual surround sound technology and deep integration with Apple’s product lineup, said the people, who requested anonymity to discuss products that aren’t yet public. Latest business videos Introducing a speaker would provide a hub to automate appliances and lights via Apple’s HomeKit system, and establish a bulwark inside the home to lock customers more tightly into Apple’s network of services. The Home and Echo mostly don’t support services from Apple, which can lead their users to stream music from such services as Spotify, Amazon Prime Music or Google Play rather than Apple Music. Insider trading Dublin man gets indicted Dublin resident Saleem Mohammad Khan was arrested Wednesday in connection with an insider trading scheme that involves an unnamed co-conspirator, authorities said. Khan, 53, was indicted on charges of conspiracy and seven counts of securities fraud, U.S. Attorney Brian Stretch and FBI Special Agent in Charge John Bennett said in a news release. The San Francisco grand jury indictment alleges that Khan received inside information about the financial performance of Ross Stores Inc., which then had its headquarters in Pleasanton. Khan allegedly bought and sold shares of the stock, sometimes using the brokerage accounts of other people. The indictment says that from 2009 through 2012, Khan and others generated illegal profits of more than $8.2 million from the scheme. New York Group wants Lyft probe A New York labor organization is calling for an investigation of Lyft and other ride-hailing services for allegedly cheating drivers. The Independent Drivers Guild said Wednesday that Lyft has been engaged in “large-scale deception” by improperly deducting more than 11 percent from drivers’ fares on interstate trips. In effect, the San Francisco company is stealing wages by collecting taxes and surcharges on trips out of state that should apply only to in-state trips, and then disguising those charges as administrative fees, the labor group says. Drivers have also accused Uber, Juno and other ride-hailing services of being less than up-front in their dealings with their citizen drivers. “There is no merit to this allegation,” Lyft spokesman Adrian Durbin said Wednesday afternoon. “Our driver agreement lays out what commissions and fees apply to driving on the Lyft platform, and we’ve consistently abided by the agreement since entering the New York market in 2014.” New York drivers found that Lyft appears to be deducting a state sales tax on out-of-state trips that should be applied only to rides that begin and end in New York, the drivers guild says. The service also appears to be improperly collecting a surcharge for the Black Car Fund on out-of-state trips.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: 3 Value Stocks for the 2nd Quarter Looking for value stocks to add to your portfolio this quarter? We have some great suggestions. Kristine Harjes, Rich Duprey, and Brian Feroldi (TMFAnchor) May 31, 2017 at 5:02PM Value investing is one of the surest strategies for building wealth: Find companies that are being priced below their true worth in the market, buy shares, wait for sentiment to change, and reap the rewards. In addition to trading at below-average multiples, these companies often pay dividends, so you're rewarded for your patience. This quarter, follow in the footsteps of famous investors such as Benjamin Graham and Warren Buffett and scoop up shares of the best value stocks. To help identify them, we've asked three Foolish contributors to highlight their favorite value stock to buy right now. Read on to learn why Nike (NYSE:NKE), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Rush Enterprises (NASDAQ:RUSHA) are three great value stocks for the second quarter. Image source: Getty Images. This powerhouse brand is on sale Brian Feroldi (Nike): North American retail sales have been in a funk lately. Many big-box retailers have reported weak results and have decided to close down hundreds of stores. That weakness has caused investors to sell off shares of many companies that have North American retail exposure, which includes apparel giant Nike. Given the pullback, I think value investors should give this megabrand a closer look. Nike's recent results show that the company is still firmly in growth mode. Total sales rose 7% on a currency-neutral basis, thanks to strong growth in international markets. While Nike's margin took a dip, the company's bottom line soared 24% higher from the year-ago period. Those are numbers that any retailer would kill for. However, the market appears to be laser-focused on the company's futures orders. This figure declined 1% on a currency-neutral basis last quarter, which hints that future results won't be so rosy. While that may be the case for the next few quarters, I think the decline in understandable given the wave of store closings. After all, those big-box retailers have to right-size their inventory levels before they place reorders. Despite the near-term headwinds, the company's results show that Nike's brand remains as strong as ever and that its international opportunity continues to be huge. With its shares trading around 21 times next year's earnings estimates, I think it's a fine time for potential shareholders to step up to the plate. Most valuable value stock in the world Kristine Harjes (Apple): Earlier this month, Forbes named Apple the most valuable brand in the world for the seventh consecutive year. With that kind of strength, it's no wonder the company has been able to sell its smartphones for an average price of $695, giving it a mighty 92% dollar share of this market. Some analysts have been criticizing Apple for a lack of innovation, but there's no denying that Apple is a cash-flow machine. The iPhone, Apple's bread and butter, is responsible for roughly two-thirds of Apple's total revenue and raked in $33 billion last quarter alone. Despite having other well-known products such as the iPad and the MacBook, the second most important revenue driver is the services segment (think App Store), which has been seeing double-digit growth rates. I have a hard time believing the bears who say that Apple's glory days of innovation are behind it, and I'm optimistic that future revenue growth will be bolstered by any one of several innovative moonshots. Apple has an absolutely monstrous amount of cash on its balance sheet -- in fact, its $67 billion of cash and short-term investments is larger than the GDP of two-thirds of the countries in the world. Jaw not on the ground yet? Consider that $67 billion is enough for a cash purchase of a company the size of Tesla. While that comparison is just for perspective, there is a great deal of speculation about whether Apple might use all that cash to make a splashy acquisition. At the very least, it's a huge asset to have the flexibility to go out and buy growth if management spots an enticing opportunity. Looking for more proof that Apple's a buy? The company led by the world's best-known value investor, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, has built a massive stake in Apple, making it one of Berkshire's largest holdings. Apple is currently trading at under 16 times free cash flow, making the second quarter a great time to buy shares of what could very well be the first trillion-dollar market cap company. Trucking's Monster Jam Rich Duprey (Rush Enterprises): Texas trucker Rush Enterprises continues to be pressured by a sluggish energy sector, a choppy freight environment, an excess of tractor-trailer capacity, and low used-truck values that are hurting truck and parts sales, as well as service revenue. That all makes it a great pick for value-oriented investors. RUSHA data by YCharts The truck market has been especially hurt by oil prices that remain at less than half their peak of $107 a barrel in June 2014, though they also recovered a lot of ground from their lows. But trucking fleets expanded during the oil boom years, as tractor-trailers were in high demand to transport oil and equipment. Today, not so much. Those spasms hit heavy truck makers such as Rush hard, which led it to close numerous dealerships last year. Still, it operates the largest network of commercial vehicle dealerships in North America, and with the energy and construction sectors beginning to tick up, Rush Enterprises is looking for a better-than-expected year this year, which will help in its parts and service business that accounts for 67% of total revenue. Where it has been seeing some strength is in medium-duty trucks, particularly in the vocational area and small fleets, though they've been lower-margin ones. Because the business looks like it's coming back in a healthy manner, if not overtly robust, Rush Enterprises stock looks particularly attractive even though its stock is up 70% over the past year. Shares trade at 28 times earnings and 19 times next year's estimates, making it look fairly valued, but it also trades at a minuscule fraction of its sales and just five times the free cash flow it produces, making it exceedingly discounted. With analysts predicting Rush Enterprises can grow earnings at 18% annually for the next five years, it would the pullback its stock has experienced after hitting its 52-week high makes it a good candidate to watch this quarter.  Brian Feroldi owns shares of Apple and Nike.

My FOIA request sought a copy of any and all rules of judicial conduct, ethical policies and/or codes of professional or judicial conduct that apply to Administrative Patent Judges (APJs) of the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB). Earlier today I received a response from the USPTO informing me that the information I requested is indexed and publicly available at the USPTO website link: https://www.uspto.gov/patents-application-process/patent-trial-and-appeal-board/ethics-guidance The website link provided by the USPTO contains no rules of judicial conduct or codes of judicial conduct, which means that the USPTO has indirectly confirmed that there are no rules or codes of judicial conduct that apply to Administrative Patent Judges (APJs) of the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB). All that appears at the webpage provided, which the USPTO characterized as containing the information responsive to my FOIA inquiry, are general ethics rules that apply to all employees of the USPTO. None of the documents specifically mention the Board, the PTAB, judges, Administrative Patent Judges, or APJs. To call this revelation by the USPTO shocking is an understatement. 37 CFR 11.803 clearly contemplates the existence of rules of judicial conduct applicable to APJs, which obviously do not exist. According to §11.803, a practitioner commits an breach of the rules of ethics applicable to the practitioner if the practitioner becomes aware that an APJ has violated the “applicable rules of judicial conduct” and does not report such violation to the appropriate authority. How a practitioner could inform the USPTO of a breach of applicable rules of judicial conduct violated by an APJ when no such rules exist is a mystery. The lack of any judicial rules of conduct or ethical rules specifically tailored for judges on the PTAB is highly informative, and explains why it was possible for at least two PTAB judges to decide post grant challenges filed by former patent defense clients. Over the last month we have written several times (here, here, here and here) about a Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) situation that, in my opinion, symbolizes everything that is wrong with a tribunal that is out of touch with reality. Prior to being hired in March 2013 by the U.S. Department of Commerce to become an Administrative Patent Judge (APJ) on the PTAB, Matthew R. Clements represented Apple as patent infringement defense counsel while working for Ropes & Gray. Since September 2014, APJ Clements has been assigned to numerous petitions, mostly CBMs but some IPRs, filed by Apple, his former client. Clements’ record in deciding cases, perhaps predictably, is tilted overwhelmingly in Apple’s favor. Similarly, APJ Stacy Beth Margolies has served as an APJ on at least two IPRs petitioned by Apple, both of which challenge patents owned by Voip-Pal.com, a developer of Internet telecommunications technologies. According to information from PACER, Margolies represented Apple as counsel in Fast Memory Erase LLC v. Spansion Inc. et. al. (ND Tex 3:08-cv-00977)(see screenshot). It is practically unbelievable that the USPTO allows for a PTAB judge to decide petitions filed by their former patent infringement defense clients after a 1-year recusal period. See Disqualification and Recusal.  These rules absolutely must be changed. They are wholly and completely inconsistent with any sensible notion of what it means to have a conflict of interest. PTAB vs. Practitioner Ethics The rule adopted by the USPTO to deal with ethical obligations to former clients is found at 37 C.F.R. 11.109, which reads in part: “(a) A practitioner who has formerly represented a client in a matter shall not thereafter represent another person in the same or a substantially related matter in which that person’s interests are materially adverse to the interests of the former client unless the former client gives informed consent, confirmed in writing.” The comments to ABA Model Rule 1.9 are instructive, because in 2013 the USPTO adopted the ABA Model Rules to govern patent practitioners. The comments to Rule 1.9 read: “Matters are ‘substantially related’ for purposes of this Rule if they involve the same transaction or legal dispute or if there otherwise is a substantial risk that confidential factual information as would normally have been obtained in the prior representation would materially advance the client’s position in the subsequent matter.” It also says: “knowledge of specific facts gained in a prior representation that are relevant to the matter in question ordinarily will preclude such a representation.” Clearly, in defending Apple for patent infringement the attorneys would learn all kinds of confidential and sensitive information about Apple, their business and legal philosophies, how they treat patent owners, litigation strategies, whether they intend to settle or take licenses ever, whether they will engage in a war of attrition, etc. etc. There is no way that any attorney could represent a party adverse to Apple in a patent infringement matter after having represented Apple. First, Apple would never allow it. Second, there is no way you could competently represent the new client without using knowledge of confidential and sensitive information learned, period. Had either Clements or Margolies not been a member of the PTAB and one of the patent owners in the cases they were deciding had come to seek representation in a PTAB proceeding against Apple, the conflict of interest question would have been a much easier question. Having represented Apple previously as defense counsel the duty to a former client under 37 CFR 11.109 would prevent them from representing the patent owner adverse to Apple and now charging Apple with patent infringement, which is a prerequisite to the filing of a CBM petition. Had representation been accepted on behalf of a patent owner in proceedings brought by Apple there would be a direct and irreconcilable violation of the ethics rules applicable to patent attorneys and patent agents. Importantly, there is no time limit on a duty to a former client, at least if you are a patent practitioner. So the 1-year recusal period is wholly without precedent and inappropriate for PTAB judges. Thus, it seems clear that the ethical bar the USPTO sets for its own Administrative Patent Judges is lower than the ethical bar set for judges of the PTAB, which is pathetically sad. In what universe does it make any sense to have a lower ethical bar for judges deciding cases than for patent practitioners? PTAB vs. Ethics for Federal Judges Canon 2A of the Code of Conduct for Article III Judges, under the title “Respect for Law,” says: “A judge should respect and comply with the law and should act at all times in a manner that promotes confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary.” The commentary that goes along with Canon 2A begins by tackling the issue of an appearance of impropriety. The comment, in relevant part, reads: An appearance of impropriety occurs when reasonable minds, with knowledge of all the relevant circumstances disclosed by a reasonable inquiry, would conclude that the judge’s honesty, integrity, impartiality, temperament, or fitness to serve as a judge is impaired. Public confidence in the judiciary is eroded by irresponsible or improper conduct by judges. A judge must avoid all impropriety and appearance of impropriety. This prohibition applies to both professional and personal conduct. A judge must expect to be the subject of constant public scrutiny and accept freely and willingly restrictions that might be viewed as burdensome by the ordinary citizen. Canon 3C of the Code of Conduct for Article III Judges, under the title “Disqualification,” reads in relevant part: “A judge shall disqualify himself or herself in a proceeding in which the judge’s impartiality might reasonably be questioned…” In the situation where there is not a per se disqualification under Canon 3C, such as for personal bias, the judge served as a lawyer in the same controversy, or the judge or a family member has a financial interest, the judge may disclose the reason disqualification would seem appropriate under Canon 3C and leave it up to the parties to decide. In this situation, however, the rules are very specific. The judge may participate in the proceeding if, after that disclosure, the parties and their lawyers have an opportunity to confer outside the presence of the judge, all agree in writing or on the record that the judge should not be disqualified, and the judge is then willing to participate. The agreement should be incorporated in the record of the proceeding. Of course, a federal judge could (and perhaps should) conclude that adjudicating a matter involving a former client creates a personal bias, which creates a per se disqualification. If that is not the case, then the parties would have to be notified and given the opportunity to discuss outside the presence of the judge. If and only if all parties agree in writing can the judge continue on the case. Thus, the rules of conduct applicable to a Article III Federal Judge are dramatically more strict than the measly 1-year recusal period the USPTO places upon PTAB judges. Conclusion PTAB judge are appointed by the Secretary of Commerce, which makes them far more than mere employees of the USPTO. They should be held to a higher standard than a generic all employees ethics policy. It is also unacceptable and completely nonsensical for APJs to have less stringent conflict standards than for the attorneys appearing before them. President Trump campaigned on draining the swamp that is Washington, DC. Many on the left and the right have tried to do so in the past, so many are understandably very skeptical. If President Trump is at all serious about draining the swamp and preventing insiders from accessing influence, how can the Department of Commerce justify allowing hand-picked PTAB judges to hear and decide cases dealing with the interests of a former defense client? The post grant challenges ushered in by the America Invents Act (AIA) were intended to be an alternative to district court litigation. As we have learned over the last 4+ years, many of the procedural protections Americans are used to in federal district court do not apply at the PTAB, which can for example simply decide not to consider evidence timely submitted. But a lack of a code of judicial ethics applicable to PTAB judges is a bridge too far and simply cannot be the type of district court alternative that Congress meant to create, is it?   The Author Gene Quinn is a Patent Attorney and Editor and founder of IPWatchdog.com.

Name withheld to protect the innocent May 31, 2017 6:18 pm To call this revelation by the USPTO shocking is an understatement To one unfamiliar with the USPTO, this should be shocking. However, for those of us that have dealt with the government behemoth named the United States Patent & Trademark Office (USPTO) and, the Board of Patent Trials and Appeal (PTAB or “Board”) in particular, this is not surprising. Playing fast and loose with the rules/law appears to be part of the culture at the USPTO. The Board has been characterized as a group of attorneys that finds way to invalidate (hold unpatentable) patent claims. Many of them have a cavalier approach to the law and wanton misrepresentation of case law is the norm. The Board’s approach to their “precedential” decisions is very illustrative. The USPTO (and hence the Board) is not permitted to make substantive law. However, the Board has promulgated many precedential decisions that involve more than Board procedure (i.e., what should be the proper scope of the Board’s precedential decision). Recent decisions such as this include Ex parte Schulhauser (claim construction) and Ex parte Mewherter (statutory subject matter). These decisions are substantive law making, which is out-of-bounds for the USPTO. The antipathy that the Board has towards Patent Owners is well-documented. For example, the Board’s implementation of the AIA’s inter-parte reexaminations is heavily slanted against the Patent Owners. Almost all of this happened during the reign of Michelle Lee, who worked for Google for nearly 10 years and was head of the Patents and Patent Strategy. As is extremely well known in the patent circles, Google would like nothing more than to eviscerate the patent system, and Michelle Lee’s actions at the USPTO reflect that strategy. Bluejay May 31, 2017 6:26 pm I hope this fact makes it into the merits brief when Oil States is heard by SCOTUS. This is another reason why SCOTUS needs to put PTAB out of business.

Shares closed at $153.67 Tuesday, and according to UBS analyst Steven Milunovich, they could climb as high as $190. The average analyst 12-month price target for Apple's stock is $163.80, according to Bloomberg data. In a note sent out to clients on Wednesday, Milunovich wrote he expects an iPhone "supercycle" to drive higher revenues for Apple. The iPhone 8 is rumored to be more of an upgrade than the previously released iPhone 7, which could lead to more consumers upgrading when the device is released later this year. The iPhone 8 is expected to be sold at a higher price than previous versions, leading to higher revenues, according to Milunovich. His analysis is based on sales growth of 15%, at an average selling price of $730 per phone. The analyst consensus estimate for gross margin in 2018 is 38.2%, while UBS estimates it will be higher at 39-40%. UBS raised its price target to $170, with an upside of $190.  View photos aapl MI screenshotMore (Markets Insider) NOW WATCH: Yale history professor: Trump's path to tyranny is unfolding More From Business Insider These undershirts solve one of the biggest problems guys have with them 50 must-have tech accessories under $50 The CEO of a massive Christian-owned craft store had a surprising response when asked about maternity leave Reblog Share Tweet Share Recently Viewed Your list is empty.

GE Digital, General Electric’s software unit, is planning to adopt it for deploying edge data center solutions for users of Predix, its industrial Internet of Things platform. Whether it’s collecting and analyzing sensor data from a chemical manufacturing plant, from an off-shore oil rig, or from a jet engine, near-real time feedback based on the analysis means there has to be some computing muscle close to where the data is generated. Even with the fastest networks, the amount of time it would take for data to travel from a factory or an aircraft to a central data center hundreds or thousands of miles away and back would be simply too big. “We have 1 to 2 millisecond latency [limit] to figure out if a turbine’s going to start malfunctioning,” Darren Haas, GE Digital’s senior VP for cloud and data, said in an interview with Data Center Knowledge. Haas joined GE last year after six years as head of cloud engineering at Apple, which he joined after Apple acquired Siri, Inc. He was part of the original team of engineers that built the technology that powers the world’s most famous virtual assistant. GE’s solution to the latency problem is to ship a “Predix box,” which will combine all the hardware and software needed for processing the data on-site, to whatever location a client needs that computing muscle in, Haas said. “We’re going to get Predix completely loaded on it and just drop-ship them everywhere. The locations we’re looking at are all across the world.” GE has a lot riding on Predix, the crown jewel of a software unit it expects to grow from $6 billion last year to $15 billion in 2020. Industrial IoT is viewed as core to the next chapter in the American titan’s history. Predix is a global cloud platform designed for developers to build and deploy industrial IoT applications. GE uses Microsoft Azure and may use Amazon Web Services in the future to host the core Predix platform, which will communicate with edge nodes at customer sites, Haas said. He expects LinkedIn’s hardware standard, called Open19, to make the process of deploying those edge nodes easier, because the hardware will be the same, regardless of where it’s being installed. Predix is designed to enable developers to build software that can move between different “form factors, environments, and regions, but we still wrestle with different standards and systems by node, region, and vendor,” Haas said in a statement. The standard will “allow us to deliver racks quickly, reduce deployment costs, and have a wider inventory, making sourcing easier than custom solutions, regardless of environment.” In other words, if numerous hardware makers around the world adopt the standard – and several of them have already put that process in motion – GE will not be limited to the sales and manufacturing cycles of one or two suppliers and their ability to deliver globally. The Ecosystem is Everything Open19 describes a cage that can be installed in a standard 19-inches-wide data center rack and filled with standard “brick” servers of various default widths and heights (half-width, full-width, single-rack unit height, double height). It also includes two power-shelf options, a single network switch for every two cages, and cable-less power and network connectors on the servers that plug into a shared backplane. A data center technician can quickly screw the cage into a rack and slide the bricks in, without the need to connect cables for every box. Hardware based on the standard isn’t yet production-ready, Yuval Bachar, LinkedIn’s principal engineer for global infrastructure architecture and strategy and Open19’s key advocate, said. Earlier this month, LinkedIn, together with GE, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, and a number of other hardware and software makers, launched a non-profit foundation to oversee further development of the standard and, importantly, build an ecosystem of vendors and end users around it. If that ecosystem doesn’t gain a certain critical mass, Open19 will remain little more than LinkedIn’s custom hardware spec. In other words, not a standard. But there’s a lot of excitement about the effort among vendors, with Flex, the electronics manufacturing giant formerly known as Flextronics, using it as a platform to enter the data center market as a vendor that sells hardware directly to end users rather than simply manufacturing it on behalf of other sellers. HPE is planning to make its line of hardware products for hyper-scale data centers called Cloudline compliant with Open19, Kara Long, an HPE senior director who oversees hyper-scale product management, said. Both Flex and the Chinese hardware maker Inspur had prototype Open19 gear on display at the foundation’s launch event held at Flex offices in Santa Clara, California. Vendors involved in the launch also included Supermicro, Wiwynn, hyve, QCT, Broadcom, Marvell, Cavium, Schneider Electric, and Vapor IO, among others. OCP-Like Prices at Lower Purchase Volumes After conversations with vendors about Open19 hardware for Predix, Haas expects to buy it at a price that’s competitive with hardware designed to specifications of the Open Compute Project, an established open source hardware design community spearheaded by Facebook. But vendors selling OCP gear (many of them are now also involved in Open19) are mainly interested in selling large volumes to hyper-scale buyers, such as Facebook and Microsoft, at steep discounts that come with large-volume orders. Unlike most OCP-compliant products, designed for custom OCP racks and electrical distribution, LinkedIn developed Open19 so that it can be deployed in any standard data center, making it more feasible for vendors to manufacture and sell the gear in smaller volumes. And Haas expects to get OCP-like prices with “very minimal purchase size.” GE needs to start rolling out the edge infrastructure for Predix fairly quickly, he said. Read more: LinkedIn’s Data Center Standard Aims to Do What OCP Hasn’t Zero-Touch Edge Nodes with AI Capabilities The plan is to make Predix boxes as hands-off for customers as possible. “We don’t want any of the people that we drop these boxes on to have to do anything, so it has to be zero-touch, full automation,” Haas said. Many of the edge nodes will have to provide high enough performance to handle Machine Learning workloads, he said. Several people involved in Open19 have indicated that high-density GPU servers for Machine Learning that are compliant with the standard are being considered. Late last year, GE Digital acquired a startup called Wise.io to accelerate development of Predix Machine Learning capabilities. While a lot of the development and training of Machine Learning models for Predix will be done in the cloud, with the final models shipped out to the edge, Haas expects some of those edge workloads to require lots of compute muscle per square foot, with power densities going north of 20kW per rack in some cases. “We’re working on some pretty crazy modeling at the edge,” he said. See also: Micro-Data Centers Out in the Wild: How Dense is the Edge? The Flexibility Trade-off While GE’s strategy for Predix computing at the edge makes sense, committing to a single hardware standard has its pros and cons, Ashish Nadkarni, computing platforms program director at the market research firm IDC, said. On the one hand, by participating in the standard’s development you can push it in a direction that’s suitable for your needs, or design custom hardware that’s compliant and can be delivered by multiple vendors; on the other hand, a standard is only as good as the ecosystem around it. LinkedIn and GE are for now the only hardware customers who officially support Open19. Yes, there is a number of vendors who are involved, but more buyers will have to join for those vendors to stay committed and for new ones to sign on. The fact that LinkedIn is now owned by Microsoft, one of the two biggest users of OCP gear that’s standardized on OCP across its entire global cloud infrastructure, adds another element of uncertainty. Will its new parent company eventually decide to consolidate LinkedIn’s infrastructure into its own facilities, depriving Open19 of its core founding user? Microsoft hasn’t yet made a decision either way, but that kind of consolidation is a common step for companies. For the strategy to work, GE will also have to sell its Predix customers on Open19, Nadkarni said. “That’s going to ultimately decide how Predix pans out.” A better strategy, in his opinion, would be to make edge software for the IoT platform independent of the type of hardware it runs on, he said. Whether that’s possible technically, given GE’s plans for a zero-touch, fully automated solution and sophisticated Machine Learning workloads at the edge, is unclear. (Haas mentioned plans to work with hardware vendors on a software layer underneath Predix that would ensure the compute and memory resources deliver the kind of performance necessary for those workloads.) “The GE Predix strategy [for edge computing] has to be more flexible,” Nadkarni said. “It has to be independent of a data center rack standard.” Previous Article Morgan Stanley's 16,000 Human Brokers Get Algorithmic Makeover Tweet Get Daily Email News from DCK!Subscribe now and get our special report, "The World's Most Unique Data Centers."

Newslook A man takes a selfie while waiting for the start of an Apple event at the Worldwide Developer's Conference on June 13, 2016 in San Francisco, California. (Photo: Andrew Burton/Getty Images) 1633 CONNECTTWEET 13 LINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE FOSTER CITY, Calif. — We’re in the heart of the tech conference season, in which giant players including Microsoft, Google, Facebook and next, Apple, lay out their visions for where their company futures—as well as the tech industry as a whole—are headed. Looking at what’s been discussed to this point (and speculating on what Apple will announce at its Worldwide Developer Conference Monday), it’s safe to say that all of these organizations are keenly focused on different types of artificial intelligence, or AI. What this means is that each wants to create unique experiences that leverage both new types of computing components and software algorithms to automatically generate useful information about the world around us. In other words, they want to use real-world data in clever ways to enable cool stuff. You may hear scary-sounding terms like convolutional neural networks, machine learning, analytics, and deep learning associated with AI, but fundamentally, the concept behind all of them is to organize large amounts of data into various structures and patterns. From there, work is done to learn from the combined data, and then actions of various types—such as being able to better interpret the importance of new incoming data—can be applied. While some of these computing principles have been around for a long time, what’s fundamentally new about the modern type of AI being pursued by these companies is its extensive use of real-world data generated by sensors—such as still and moving images, audio, location, motion, etc.—and the speed at which the calculations on the data are occurring. When done properly, the net result of these computing efforts is a nearly magical experience where we can have a smarter, more informed view of the world around us. At Google’s recent I/O event, for example, the company debuted its new Lens capability for Google Assistant, which can provide information about the objects and places within your view. In practical terms, Lens allows you to point your smartphone camera at something and have information about the objects in view appear overlaid on the phone screen. Essentially, it’s a form of augmented reality that I expect we will see other major platform vendors provide soon (hint: Apple). Related: Inside Mark Zuckerberg's vision for your Facebook augmented reality Google I/O: Here are the big changes coming to Google Siri vs. Google Assistant on the iPhone: here's who's talking Microsoft to sell mixed-reality headset and controllers for $399, undercutting Oculus Behind the scenes, however, the effort to make something like Lens work involves an enormous amount of technology, including reading the live video input from the camera (a type of sensor, by the way), applying AI-enabled computer vision algorithms to both recognize the objects and their relative location, combining that with location details from the phone’s GPS and/or WiFi signals, looking up relevant information on the objects, and then combining all of that onto the phone’s display. Of course, there are thousands of other examples of potential AI-driven experiences, each of which requires different combinations of computing components and software. In fact, in this new computing era, we’re starting to see a remarkably diverse set of technologies being developed and used to enable these new activities. Here are some of the companies involved. On the chip side, for example, instead of just thinking about CPUs in the devices that are driving these experiences, we’ve seen companies like Nvidia successfully demonstrate how GPUs, which are traditionally only used for doing computer graphics, can be powerful new AI computing tools. Other GPU providers, such as AMD and chip intellectual property-licensing firm ARM have also started to introduce new offerings that are focused on artificial intelligence-based applications. Not all artificial intelligence-based applications are primarily suited for GPUs, however. Companies like Qualcomm are also starting to demonstrate how components like DSPs (digital signal processors) can be very power-efficient tools for doing AI. Not be outdone, chip powerhouse Intel now offers an entire range of different chip architectures, including dedicated AI chips from recently purchased Nervana, to FPGAs (field programmable gate arrays) and, yes, CPUs for doing different types of AI work.

And Apple is  working on a Neural Engine chip specifically for doing AI on future generation iPhones and other devices, according to Bloomberg. Ironically, in the midst of all this new technology, one of the other intriguing aspects of AI-driven applications is that they’re pushing our traditional computing devices into the background. Sure, we’re still often using things like smartphones to enable some of these experiences, but the ultimate goal of these advanced AI computing architectures is to make our technology become invisible. Voice-based computing and digital assistants are a step in this direction, but we’ll eventually see (hopefully!) small, discrete head-mounted displays and other new methods of interacting with a computing-enhanced and more contextually aware view of the real-world around us. Though some have voiced concerns about the rapid encroachment of computer-driven artificial intelligence, it’s actually leading us to a very different type of computing future that promises to be less intrusive and more useful than what we’re currently experiencing. And that’s something to be excited about.

According to a new report from Bloomberg, Apple has started overseas production of its Siri-enabled smart speaker. Apple could unveil this highly-anticipated Siri Speaker onstage during the WWDC keynote taking place on Monday, June 5, but the all-new device won’t be ready to ship until later this year. The Siri Speaker has been designed to compete against the Amazon Echo and Google Home. To differentiate itself from those other products, the Apple smart speaker will boast virtual surround sound and will be more seamlessly integrated with Apple products and services, like Apple Music. In addition, the Siri Speaker will give Apple users a new hub for controlling HomeKit-enabled devices around their home. [ Further reading: The best home water leak detectors ] Bloomberg also revealed that Apple won’t integrate a screen in its first iteration of the Siri Speaker. Earlier this month, Apple’s senior V.P. of Marketing Phil Schiller said that he wasn’t a fan of Amazon Echo or Google Home because they lacked screens. Days later, Amazon introduced Echo Show, a version of its flagship smart speaker with a touchscreen. The Siri Speaker is being produced by Inventec, the Taipei-based manufacturer already responsible for making the wireless AirPods. According to Bloomberg, the Siri Speaker has been in development for a long time, reaching the advanced prototype stage late last year. For several months now, Apple employees have been secretly testing the device in their own homes. Why this matters: Apple is banking on a smart speaker with superior sound quality and deeper ties to the Apple ecosystem. Those two features seem certain, given the Beats ownership and the new W1 chip that can pair devices seamlessly. In addition, the Siri Speaker could include sensors to measure indoor acoustics and automatically adjust audio levels.  But will that be enough to make the Siri Speaker a must-have? Amazon is already ahead in bringing third-party apps to its Alexa-powered Echo devices, even Apple services like iCloud calendar are being brought to the fold. Meanwhile, Google has recently made its AI assistant available on iOS, pointing out some serious Siri fails. And HomeKit devices can already be operated using an iPhone, iPad, or Apple TV.  To comment on this article and other Macworld content, visit our Facebook page or our Twitter feed.

By Rene Ritchie Wednesday, May 31, 2017 at 12:30 pm EDT 1 Comment Come Monday, the WWDC 2017 Keynote will be set in stone. Now, though, I can speculate about anything — including the potential for an augmented reality framework. "And to show it off, I'd like to welcome onto the stage John Hanke, CEO of Niantic." "Thanks, Craig. Hello, everyone! Now, remember what it used to look like when you were playing Pokémon Go and you caught a Tyranitar in AR mode? Well, with Apple's new augmented reality framework, ARKit, now it looks like THIS!" No one outside a very small group of people at Apple know for certain what we'll see at the WWDC 2017 keynote taking place this coming Monday. Even then, plans can and do change up until the last possible moment. So why speculate now? Because it's the best possible time. Come Monday afternoon, the myriad lines of dream and expectation will have been canceled out into a few hard facts. Everything will be known. Until then, though, I get to wonder out loud about anything and everything — including augmented reality (AR). Many of the other tech giants already have AR technology in the field. Google had Glass and Android has a variety of headgear and built-in apps. Microsoft has HoloLens. HTC has Vive. Snapchat has Snapticles — er, Spectacles. Facebook has Oculus and is rolling out more. And the list goes on. Apple, as usual, has been quiet about future plans and projects. But not completely quiet. AR is big Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, has been more willing to discuss AR than any other special project currently underway at Apple. Talking to The Independant on February 10, 2017: I'm excited about Augmented Reality because unlike Virtual Reality which closes the world out, AR allows individuals to be present in the world but hopefully allows an improvement on what's happening presently. Most people don't want to lock themselves out from the world for a long period of time and today you can't do that because you get sick from it. With AR you can, not be engrossed in something, but have it be a part of your world, of your conversation. That has resonance. I regard it as a big idea like the smartphone. The smartphone is for everyone, we don't have to think the iPhone is about a certain demographic, or country or vertical market: it's for everyone. I think AR is that big, it's huge. I get excited because of the things that could be done that could improve a lot of lives. And be entertaining. I view AR like I view the silicon here in my iPhone, it's not a product per se, it's a core technology. But there are things to discover before that technology is good enough for the mainstream. I do think there can be a lot of things that really help people out in daily life, real-life things, that's why I get so excited about it. On October 13, 2016, while speaking to BuzzFeed: "There's no substitute for human contact," Cook told BuzzFeed News. "And so you want the technology to encourage that." It's not the first time Cook has indicated that Apple might favor AR. "We are high on AR for the long run," Cook said during an earnings call this past summer. "I think AR can be huge." "VR has some interesting applications, but I don't think it's a broad-based technology like AR," Cook explained. "Augmented reality will take some time to get right, but I do think that it's profound. We might … have a more productive conversation, if both of us have an AR experience standing here, right? And so I think that things like these are better when they're incorporated without becoming a barrier to our talking. … You want the technology to amplify it, not to be a barrier." During Apple's Q2 2016 conference call on July 26, 2016: In terms of AR and the Pokémon phenomenon, it's incredible what has happened there. I think it's a testament to what happens with innovative apps and the whole ecosystem and the power of a developer being able to press a button, so to speak, and offer their product around the world. This certain developer has elected not to go worldwide yet, because of the pressure on their servers, etc. because of the demand, but I'm sure that they will over time. It also does show, as you point out, that AR can be really great and we're— we have been and continue to invest a lot in this. We are high on AR for the long run. We think there's great things for customers and a great commercial opportunity. So we're investing, and the number one thing is to make sure our products work well with other developers kind of products like Pokémon. And that's the reason you see so many iPhones out in the wild right now chasing Pokémon. You know, I know there's people that want to call it a new computer platform, and we'll see. I think there's a tendency to call everything new the next computer platform, however, that said, I think AR can be huge. So, we'll see whether it's the next platform. Regardless, it will be huge. Bits before atoms There have also been rumors of iPhone 8 being AR-capable and even of Apple making its own AR glasses. But those are products and if there's on thing we've seen with Apple, it's that products are made great not just through gorgeous atoms but through highly integrated bits. So if Apple is working on AR, the company is no doubt also working on "ARKit", or whatever the name will be for the frameworks that drive it and the apps that will, eventually, bring it to life. The way SpriteKit addresses 2D objects and SceneKit, 3D. That's the way WWDC works, after all. Sometimes, before we ever see hardware, we see frameworks. Look no further than size classes, released at WWDC 2015, just a few short months before iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. Apple doesn't have to show off AR hardware at WWDC. Not if they have some killer software ready to show. How could Apple demonstrate AR frameworks without demonstrating AR gear, though? Through existing gear and AR apps. Tim Cook has name-dropped Pokémon Go a couple of times over the last year. Sundar Pichai as recently as last month's Google I/O credited that game, rather than his own company's Glass, as starting them down the path of AR. Not the Pokémon point It doesn't have to be Pokémon Go specifically, of course. Maybe it's some similar game based on Harry Potter's Fantastic Beasts or another compatible franchise. It just has to be a great demo on stage. John Hanke, or someone like him, just has to get up and talk about how ARKit (or whatever it's called) allows Pikachu (or some other character) to better and more easily track motion and integrate with real-world environments than anything that's come before. If the company simultaneously announces the new Gym system or, even better, a brief window of player vs. player exclusivity on iOS, then the sizzle is so hot people won't even pay attention to the steak. And Apple gets AR bits going without having to reveal a single atom before its time. That's a really bad example, of course, because Pokémon Go uses Unity and so likely couldn't adopt Apple-specific technologies (regardless of how much better it would make the experience); so much of its player-base is on Android, even a brief window of exclusivity likely wouldn't go over well. But I picked on Pokémon Go because I'm still sore Ninatic took the stage at WWDC 2016, showed off a Snorlax, and yet didn't make one spawn for all the grizzled reporters and seasoned analysts who'd suddenly grasped for their phones, eyes lit up in anticipation. And, of course, Niantic was on stage at the iPhone 7 event in Sepetmber as well, showing off the Pokémon Go app for Apple Watch. Again, it could be any game that demos great. That is, if AR is a game Apple wants to get into this summer. iPhone 7 iPhone 8 Roundup iPhone 7 Review iPhone 7 Buyers Guide iPhone 7 Users Guide iPhone 7 News Hub iPhone 7 Discussion Pokemon Go Pokémon Go Ultimate Guide Pokémon Go tips and tricks Pokémon Go cheats Where to find rare Pokémon How to catch rare Pokémon How to hatch Pokémon Eggs faster Best Pokémon to evolve and power up Best Pokémon movesets Fix Pokémon Go problems Pokemon Go help and discussion forum Reader comments If — big if — Apple wants to show off ARKit at WWDC 2017, here's how they could do it! 1 Comment View All Comments Log In to Comment Register Sort by Date Sort by Rating gpdawson My biggest problem with AR is that current generation device compasses (magnetometers) are prone to jumping and jitter. Whilst the use of gyroscopes (by combining it with the magnetometer data) has helped this to some degree, by smoothing out the short-term changes, never-the-less the heading accuracy reported by iOS (and Android devices) from their sensors is typically at best only within a few degrees (i.e. when recently calibrated and not subject to external magnetic influences), but more typically can have errors of 10 degrees or more. This may be of little consequence for certain AR applications such as games, but is a substantial issue for AR applications that require high directional precision, such as apps like "Sun Seeker" that show the solar path in AR view. In fact I would go so far as to say that this issue is the single biggest "pain" point of users of AR apps. I personally would be delighted to see more accurate sensors becoming available to phone manufacturers, although I'm not aware of anything new along these lines at this point. Any chance Apple might have a big new reveal along these lines? :-) 0 4 hours ago Reply Menu Log in or Sign up Search Apple Apps & Games Accessories & Toys Photo & Video Health & Fitness Movies & Music Transport Security Rumors Analysis How To The Best Reviews Deals Newsletter Forums Podcasts Android Central WindowsCentral iMore CrackBerry Connectedly TeslaCentral VRHeads MrMobile Modern Dad About Contact Us Jobs Privacy & Terms Mobile Nations 500M Consumers Reached Yearly Copyright 2017 Mobile Nations Terms and Conditions Privacy Policy Careers: Writer | Dev Licensing External Links Disclosure Advertising Partner

It could debut in June during the annual developer conference. Despite that, it won’t be ready to ship. This speaker will have a virtual surround sound technology. It’s also integrated with the product lineup of the company. When it launches, it serves several purposes. But the main thing is to provide a connection to automate appliances and lights through the HomeKit system. It can also lock customers tightly to Apple’s ecosystem. With those things in mind, it could compete effectively with the connected speakers of Google and Amazon. Currently, the Home and Echo aren’t compatible with Apple services. But without compatibility, users are more likely to choose Echo or Home and use other streaming services than Apple Music. As iPhone sales slowed down, Tim Cook focused on the company’s services businesses. He states that the service revenue might double three years from now. With the Siri-controlled speaker, it may help in keeping their customers to be loyal to the service products. For months now, Apple employees are testing the device in their homes. Late last year, the speaker has reached an advanced prototype stage. The annual developer’s conference this year will introduce new hardware. It’ll be the first since 2013. The company might also announce its updated tablets. The last updated iPad Pro was seen in March 2016. It also hasn’t refreshed its 12.9-inch model since 2015. During the conference, the company will introduce latest versions of its MacBook and Pro. These versions will use faster Intel processors. Virtual Surround Sound Apple will add a more advanced sound technology to give its speaker an edge over its competitors. It’ll be louder, and the sound is crisper than its rivals. It may also include sensors that can measure the acoustics of the room and adjust the sound level automatically. The company may also allow third-party companies to build products for it. Uber and Facebook are the first two companies that developed products for Siri enabling users to request a ride or send a WhatsApp message using a voice command. With this speaker, users can control its devices, such as windows blinds and door locks, through HomeKit automation system. Currently, iPad is needed to control them when users are outside their home. But Google and Amazon are already upgrading their speakers ahead of Apple’s launch. Google Home offers support so users can make voice calls. Amazon’s speaker, on the other hand, has a touchscreen. But Siri-controlled speaker won’t have this type of screen, unfortunately. It’s not the first time that Apple offered its customers speakers with excellent sound quality. In 2006, it introduced iPod Hi-Fi. However, the company discontinued it because of its high price and huge size. With this new speaker, Apple may do better. Apple’s WWDC keynote will happen this Monday. Every person who loves Apple products would like to know what the company has in store for its loyal users. Will it introduce its long-rumored speaker or it could be something else?

While the firm will announce its usual updates to its operating systems, it might also announce a new standalone Siri-powered speaker, similar to Google's Home, Amazon's Echo, and Harman Kardon's Cortana-powered Invoke. The report comes from Bloomberg, and the device has allegedly already entered production. Unfortunately for those that want to get their hands on such a speaker, it won't ship until later on this year. The speaker will offer "virtual surround sound technology", which would be a differentiator from its competitors. Naturally, its other differentiators would be Apple services, such as Apple Music, and integration with the company's devices. The firm will also likely offer developers the opportunity to implement third-party "skills" with the device, as its competitors already do. This is why WWDC seems like a natural time for Apple to announce such a device, as it's a developer conference, even if the speaker isn't slated to actually be released until the end of the year. Nevertheless, Apple should have quite a bit lined up for its day one keynote on Monday. Aside from major updates to iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS, the company is also rumored to be announcing new hardware, including new iPad Pros and new MacBooks.

Will Apple announce an Amazon Echo rival? Tyler Lizenby/CNET Smart Home by Megan Wollerton 30 May 2017 11:41 pm BST @meganwollerton Top 5 features a Siri-powered speaker needs Apple is reportedly working on an Amazon Echo competitor. Here's what it would need to be a success. by Iyaz Akhtar 2:09 Close Drag Autoplay: ON Autoplay: OFF Apple holds its annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) confab on Monday, June 5. Will the company use the stage to show off its rumored rival to the Amazon Echo and Google Home? For Apple, a smart speaker would be a long time coming. Its smart home platform, HomeKit, was announced at WWDC 2014 -- months before the surprise unveiling of the first Amazon Echo. Three years later, we're still waiting for Apple to introduce a voice-control speaker that isn't tied to its mobile software iOS. Related stories Apple exec mocks Google Home and Amazon Echo Apple's Siri speaker could debut at WWDC Apple's Echo rival could see you with built-in camera Apple building Amazon Echo competitor, says report Voice-control speakers like the Amazon Echo and the Google Home have gone a long way to help unify our connected devices. Not only is voice control an easy entry point to device control for most family members, standalone speakers also help bring the functionality to the center of the home in a way that Apple's iOS-based HomeKit has not yet managed to do. You can ask Amazon's Alexa to set a 15-minute kitchen timer, to remind you to give your dog his heart worm pill -- and even to adjust the thermostat. You can use Google's Home to follow along with a recipe or to turn on your favorite Netflix show (with help from Chromecast). Apple's HomeKit can do a lot of the same things through its iOS 10 Home app and Siri, but input is limited to mobile devices, including the Apple Watch. (As of last year's MacOS Sierra update, Siri is on the Mac, too -- but it's far more limited.) Adding a standalone speaker to compete with Amazon and Google could go a long way to making Apple more competitive in the smart home space. If anything, the delay has helped fuel speculation about Apple's plans. Here's an overview of all of the rumors we've heard in the months leading up to WWDC 2017. (Note that Apple did not immediately respond to our request for comment.) 15 Look inside this $1 million Apple smart home Is it really happening? May 31, 2017: Apple has begun production on a smart speaker, according to a Bloomberg report published Wednesday. The article cites "people familiar with the matter," who said the device could be unveiled as early WWDC, but that it won't be available to customers until later this year. The Amazon Echo and Google Home rival will supposedly have surround sound and work with Apple HomeKit products.  An integrated touchscreen? May 6, 2017: Apple SVP of worldwide marketing Phil Schiller suggested he wasn't impressed with the Amazon or Google speakers in an interview with India's Gadgets 360. "Well, I won't talk to either one specifically, [I] don't want to. My mother used to have a saying that if you don't have something nice to say, say nothing at all," Schiller said. He went on to address the importance of interacting with a screen. "There's many moments where a voice assistant is really beneficial," he said, "but that doesn't mean you'd never want a screen. So the idea of not having a screen, I don't think suits many situations." Amazon unveiled the $230 Echo Show on May 9, a touchscreen-equipped Alexa device that you can use for video calls or to view live security camera feeds. Google's Home speaker doesn't come with an integrated touchscreen. I personally don't like the idea of having a screen sitting on my coffee table or kitchen counter 24/7. I imagine the next step will be a Alexa-enabled control panel you'd hardwire like the Wink Relay or the Lucis NuBryte Touchpoint. Apple's speaker likely to debut at WWDC May 1, 2017: Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said, "We believe there is an over 50 [percent] chance that Apple will announce its first home AI product at WWDC in June," in a MacRumors report. The story also claimed Apple's speaker will cost more than the Amazon Echo and work with AirPlay. If that price point is correct, Apple's speaker could cost more than any of the models sold today. Here's an overview of the current smart speaker lineup: Amazon Echo Show: $230 (available for preorder) Enlarge Image The $50 Amazon Echo Dot is the most affordable voice assistant available today. James Martin/CNET Amazon Echo Look: $200 (available by invitation) Amazon Echo: $180 Amazon Echo Dot: $50 Amazon Tap: $130 Google Home: $130 Read CNET's post on this news. A built-in camera? May 27, 2016: CNET reported that Apple's smart speaker might have an integrated camera. According to sources familiar with Apple's plans, the product would be able to recognize who's in a room via facial detection tech. Imagine walking near the device, having it recognize you and then automatically adjust the lights -- or the music to suit your preferences. Amazon introduced its camera-equipped $200 Echo Look back in April. Rather than being marketed as a security camera, the Echo Look is supposed to act as your very own style consultant. Google's Home doesn't currently have an integrated camera. The beginning May 24, 2016: Talk of a standalone Apple speaker, powered by Siri, was first reported by The Information. The story claims Apple had been discussing a developer-friendly version of Siri for years, before deciding to go ahead with the device. In addition, The Information reported that Apple's upcoming Echo and Home competitor would have a speaker and a microphone that you could use to play music, listen to news headlines -- and even control HomeKit-enabled devices.

Among those urging President Trump to keep the United States in the Paris climate agreement are Cook, Tesla’s Elon Musk, and Dow Chemical’s Andrew Liveris… Spigen TEKA RA200 Airpods Earhooks Cover Cook reportedly placed a call to the White House yesterday, during which he pleaded with the president to keep the United States in the climate change agreement. Meanwhile, Liveris was behind a letter from 30 major company executives supporting the agreement and Musk took to Twitter to say he has done all that he can to advise the president on the matter. It has been reported by several outlets that President Trump currently intends to leave the pact, while Trump himself has teased on Twitter that he will announce his decision “over the next few days.” The Paris climate agreement is supported by 195 countries around the world and centers around reducing greenhouse gas emissions to negate the impact of climate change. The only two countries in the United Nations that are not currently in support for the agreement are Syria and Nicaragua. Tim Cook has long been a proponent of clean energy, working to power Apple’s operations by 100 percent renewable energy. In its 2017 Environment Responsibility Report released earlier this year, Apple said that it powers its facilities by 96 percent renewable energy, up from 93 percent in 2017. Furthermore, Apple has pushed its suppliers to be more aware of their impact on the environment. Currently, seven of Apple’s major suppliers have promised to use renewable energy by the end of next year. Perhaps most notably, Apple recently announced its plans to stop mining the earth and build all of its products from recycled materials. “Climate change is undeniable. Earth’s resources won’t last forever. And technology must be safe for people to make and use. We don’t question these realities — we challenge ourselves to ask what we can do about them in every part of our business.” Tim Cook is strong believer in putting differences aside to work with President Trump and his administration. Cook attended a meeting at Trump Tower late last year, while he also had dinner with Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump.

Report: Apple’s Version Of A Connected Speaker To Debut Later This Year Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Report: Apple’s Version Of A Connected Speaker To Debut Later This Year Image courtesy of Håkan Dahlström May 31, 2017 5:08 pm EDT By Laura Northrup@lnorthrup apple speakers ispeaker HomeKit Smart Homes hubs apple speaker apple Apple makes phones, tablets, computers, headphones, and even easy-to-lose wireless earbuds, but there’s one thing missing. Unlike Google and Amazon, Apple doesn’t sell a smart speaker that also serves as a smart home hub. That’s reportedly about to change, and factories are starting to crank out Apple’s take on the hot products. Those ever-wise “people with knowledge of the matter” told Bloomberg News that the speaker is coming, and is made by Inventec, which also makes AirPods. While the speakers wouldn’t go on sale until later this year, they could be announced in June at Apple’s developers’ conference. According to the sources, the speakers are powered by the Siri virtual assistant that’s available on Apple’s phones, tablets, and computers. Apple hopes to differentiate its version of a common product with better sound quality, and features like virtual surround sound and sensors that are able to measure a room and adjust the acoustics accordingly. It would also help make Apple’s HomeKit smart home software more useful, since users now have to coordinate their devices with an AppleTV or an iPad. In addition to controlling HomeKit-compatible third-party smart devices, Apple will reportedly also let third-party developers create voice functions for the speaker. Last year, Apple began preparing for this by letting developers in to use Siri and make iOS voice commands do something useful. If the unnamed speaker does launch in June, it would be the first new piece of hardware announced at Apple’s WWDC since 2013, when the cylindrical Mac Pro was introduced.

And according to a new report, Apple will be joining the competition soon, too. Apple has started production on a smart speaker powered by Siri and it could announce the device as soon as WWDC next week, say sources speaking to Bloomberg. However, the speaker may not be ready to ship to consumers until later in 2017. Apple will reportedly focus on the speaker’s sound quality as a way to help it stand out from competition like Amazon’s Echo and Google’s Home. Apple’s device will reportedly offer virtual surround sound and advanced acoustics technologies, and the speakers that Apple is currently testing are said to be louder and crisper than competing products. Other rumored features of this Apple smart speaker include integration with smart home devices that support Apple’s HomeKit, giving users control over lights, door locks and more. Apple may also let third-party services build products for its speaker. If Apple is indeed planning to introduce its smart speaker at WWDC, it’s possible that the company hopes to launch the device at its annual fall iPhone event and give developers a few months’ time to build apps for it. As for the speaker itself, a focus on high-quality audio could be a good way to help it stand out. While the Amazon Echo and Google Home can play music, they aren’t considered to be high-quality speakers, so Apple could use improved sound quality as a differentiator since many folks use these speakers in places like the kitchen.

The report comes after KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said in May there’s a more than 50 percent chance Apple will unveil its Siri speaker at the Worldwide Developers Conference. Tuesday’s report said the device will debut as soon as WWDC next week, but the gadget will not be ready to ship until later this year. Read: James Corden Carpool Karaoke Apple Music Spinoff Debuts In August It was reported earlier this month that Apple employees were testing the Siri speaker in their homes for several months. The device reportedly entered an advanced prototype stage last fall.   Apple’s Siri Speaker Rumors, Features Bloomberg’s recent report said the device will have an engraving that will say: “Designed by Apple in California.” Here are more features that could be included in the Siri speaker: Read: Apple Will Introduce New MacBook Lineup At WWDC, Could Debut Revamped MacBook Air Better Sound Apple is looking to differentiate the Siri speaker from its competitors, including Amazon’s Echo devices and Google Home gadgets. The iPhone maker’s new device will offer “virtual surround sound technology and deep integration with Apple’s product lineup,” the report said. The company hopes advanced acoustics technology will propel the gadget above its competitors. Apple is testing speakers that generate virtual surround sound, greater volume and crisper sound than rival products. The iPhone seller also reportedly has considered including sensors that measure the environment’s acoustics and automatically adjust audio levels. Controlling Home Appliances Apple also wants Siri speaker owners to use the device for their homes by allowing customers to control appliances and lights through the company’s HomeKit system. The use of HomeKit potentially could lock in customers to Apple’s network and keep them from using Amazon Echo or Google Home devices for those tasks. Apple Music The speaker could also be a way to boost Apple Music subscriptions and steer consumers away from rivals, including Spotify and Amazon Prime’s streaming service. Apple has been pushing original content on Apple Music lately. The company is expected to release as many as 10 original shows and documentaries by the end of this year, including will.i.am’s "Planet of the Apps" and documentaries about hip-hop label Cash Money Records and music impresario Clive Davis. Apple might also let third-party services develop products for the Siri device, the report said. Apple Siri Speaker Price, More Rumors Kuo said earlier this month the Siri speaker will cost more than the Amazon Echo. He added the gadget will support AirPlay and will have a performance similar to the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6S. As of now, it’s not clear whether Apple’s speaker will come with a built-in display, like Amazon’s Echo Show, which was unveiled this month. Apple marketing chief Phil Schiller said recently he thinks voice assistant devices are beneficial, but that doesn't mean you'd never want a screen. If the Siri speaker is revealed at WWDC, it will follow Amazon’s Echo Show and the Echo Look, which were unveiled late last month.

Bloomberg sources say the Cupertino giant could, as previously rumored, choose to introduce the Amazon Echo rival less than a week from now during its Worldwide Developers’ Conference on June 5. According to the people ‘familiar with the matter’ Apple will be able to differentiate itself from the Echo and Google Home by offering ‘virtual surround sound tech’ and ‘deep integration’ with other Apple products. That last part appears to be crucial. As well as a home hub for HomeKit-enabled devices, Apple is also hoping this device will help keep customers ‘locked in’ to its wider ecosystem, according to the report. For example, the Google Home and Amazon Echo don’t support Apple Music, which may lead consumers to stream from Spotify, rather than sign up for Apple’s platform. This hardware could ward off that threat. Related: Amazon Echo vs Google Home The sources say the speaker will be louder and ‘reproduce sound more crisply’ than the Echo and Google Home, neither of which are too hot as standalone speakers. The company is also looking to tailor the audio to users’ living environments by adding sensors to measure room acoustics, according to today’s piece. If today's report proves accurate. Apple will also embrace third-party services through the Siri-controlled speaker, as it did within iOS 10 last year. Users will be able to book an Uber or send WhatsApp messages, the report suggests. In another interesting note, according to the report, Inventec, the company behind the recent release of AirPods is said to be in charge of the production. Has the delay in entering the market allowed Apple to get this release just right?

The iPhone-maker has started manufacturing a long-in-the-works Siri-controlled smart speaker, according to people familiar with the matter. Apple could debut the speaker as soon as its annual developer conference in June, but the device will not be ready to ship until later in the year, the people said. The Siri speaker will allegedly differentiate itself from the Amazon Echo and Google Home devices by offering virtual surround sound technology and deep integration with the Apple ecosystem. It will of course be able to control devices via Apple HomeKit and allow users to access Apple services such as Apple Music. As we previously reported, Inventec is said to have landed orders for the new speaker which reached an advanced prototype stage late last year.

In addition to generating virtual surround sound, the speakers are purportedly louder and more crisp than rival offerings. The company also considered including sensors that would measure a room's acoustics and automatically adjust audio levels. Notably, while Apple has questioned the utility of such a device without a screen and rival Amazon has just launched its Echo Show, Apple's speaker will not have a display, according to people who have seen it.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Hardware Image Source: Niels Epting It sounds like Apple’s Siri speaker will be worth the wait Yoni Heisler @edibleapple May 31st, 2017 at 4:17 PM Share Tweet With WWDC just around the corner, we’re just a few days away from Apple unveiling iOS 11 along with new versions of macOS, tvOS, and watchOS. While WWDC is typically a software-only affair, rumor has it that Apple at WWDC this year will have a slew of hardware announcements. In addition to a brand new edgeless 10.5-inch iPad and a refreshed MacBook line, there are rumblings that Apple will introduce a Siri-based speaker next week at WWDC. Don't Miss: Aerospace exec says aliens not only exist, they’re living on Earth right now According to reports which surfaced over the past few weeks, Apple’s Siri-based speaker will compete with Google Home and Amazon’s Echo. Feature wise, the product will reportedly incorporate Beats audio technology and will offer users a premium acoustic experience. As for how Apple’s offering might differ from existing smart speakers already on the market, there are rumblings that the device will feature a touchscreen, a design that Apple executive Phil Schiller arguably confirmed just earlier this month during an interview. “So there’s many moments where a voice assistant is really beneficial, but that doesn’t mean you’d never want a screen,” Schiller said a few weeks back. “So the idea of not having a screen, I don’t think suits many situations.” Additionally, a new Bloomberg report sheds some more light on how Apple may carve out space for itself in a market currently dominated by Google and Amazon. Specifically, the report relays that Apple’s Siri speaker will feature virtual surround sound technology and will be tightly integrated with the entirety of Apple’s ecosystem. Apple hopes that more advanced acoustics technology will give the speaker an edge over competitors, according to people with knowledge of the product’s development. Along with generating virtual surround sound, the speakers being tested are louder and reproduce sound more crisply than rival offerings, the people said. Apple has also considered including sensors that measure a room’s acoustics and automatically adjust audio levels during use, one of the people said. This is all very intriguing, but it remains to be seen if the acoustic features Apple might deliver will prove to be enough of a draw for users who might reasonably prioritize functionality over premium acoustics. In other words, a top of the line acoustic experience might be an altogether moot point if Siri performance can’t keep pace with what Amazon and Google are able to deliver. The upside, though, is that a Siri speaker will be able to incorporate larger and more advanced microphones which should help processing. What’s more, there are rumors that Apple at WWDC this year will introduce an enhanced version of Siri. On a related note, Apple is supposedly working on its own neural network that will reportedly help bolster Siri’s artificial intelligence capabilities significantly. With WWDC set to kick off this coming Monday, we won’t have to wait too much longer to find out.

In a new Apple ad, a thief breaks into “your phone” but struggles to get into an iPhone. Here’s how it plays out in the real world. By Emily Bary May 31, 2017 2:14 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large Apple wants to give you a new reason for buying the iPhone. The company’s latest ad campaign features a thief who’s able to break in and steal things from “your phone,” but the line gets drawn -- quite literally -- at an iPhone. In the ad, a thief tries to enter an iPhone space but gets rebuffed and quickly gives up. The iOS versus Android security debate has been playing out for years, but Apple thinks it has enough of an edge now to make it part of the iPhone’s marketing campaign -- a reason for consumers to switch, presumably from an Android device to an iPhone. We wondered how the iOS/Android security question plays out in the real world and dialed up an expert to find out. There are several reasons why iPhones are more secure than the various phones running Android software, according to Mike Johnson, who runs the security technologies graduate program at the University of Minnesota. Johnson has used both Android and iOS devices, but he has an iPhone because of its security edge. For one, the old rule about PC viruses seems to be holding true with mobile phones, as well. Android phones make up more than 80% of the global smartphone market, and hackers are more likely to succeed if they write programs for these devices, just because of sheer numbers. “Criminals are going to target the thing that provides them the most return,” Johnson says. Plus, he says, the process of “patching” security holes is easier on iOS devices. Apple’s iOS operating system only runs on iPhones, while Alphabet’s Android software runs on phones made by numerous manufacturers. It’s more complicated to deliver patches, or bug fixes, that work across so many device makers and carriers. Android can release a patch, but it won’t necessarily be available on all devices right away. “Fragmentation is the enemy of security,” Johnson says. There’s a financial way to measure vulnerability, as well. So-called “zero days” are exploits discovered by hackers and security researchers that remain unknown to the software developer. When developers don’t know about them, they can’t issue a patch. That makes the exploits valuable to the intelligence community, and government agencies will sometimes buy those zero days to monitor suspected criminal behavior. Last year, Wired magazine reported that one security firm was offering up to $1.5 million for the most serious iOS exploits and up to $200,000 for an Android one, a sign that iOS vulnerabilities are rarer. Every device is at risk, Johnson notes, and there will be malicious apps in the App Store in addition to, say, the Google Play store. But, he says, Apple “has the right and edge to say we are more secure,” because its users are ultimately less vulnerable to hacks. Whether the security angle will draw in more users remains to be seen. Ordinary users tend to pay attention to other factors -- like cameras and screens -- when they choose new phones. Both of which are likely to get big upgrades in the next iPhone -- and surely their own ad campaign.

By Oscar Raymundo Staff Writer, Macworld | May 31, 2017 12:49 PM PT Credit: Adam Patrick Murray More like this New iPad rumors: Planned Apple Store outage on Tuesday—could it be new iPads? New 10.5-inch iPad may debut alongside Siri Speaker at WWDC iPhone 8 rumors: Delayed production schedule could result in blockbuster... Video Is Snapchat building the iPhone killer? WWDC is typically a software show, but there’s now more evidence that Apple is planning to announce new hardware as well. According to information obtained by French website, Consomac, Apple has registered new model numbers with the Eurasian Economic Commission. The assumption is that these numbers coincide with new Macs and new iPads being announced at WWDC next week. Russia requires companies to register all new products that utilize encryption tools. Five model numbers (A1289, A1347, A1418, A1419, and A1481) belong to products running macOS 10.12, possibly a 13- and 15-inch MacBook Pro, a 12-inch MacBook, and perhaps a refreshed MacBook Air. However, MacRumors pointed out that these numbers don’t have the same AXX prefixes for current MacBook models. In addition, Apple registered four model numbers (A1671, A1709, A1670, and A1701) that corresponded to iOS 10 devices. This seems to corroborate the rumored launch of the new 10.5-inch iPad Pro next week. Consomac also discovered a model number (A1843) belonging to a spare part for the Mac, which could possibly be a new wireless keyboard.  The story behind the story: This is not the first time that we’ve heard evidence of potential new hardware coming out of WWDC. Bloomberg originally suggested that Apple was gearing up to launch three new laptops: A MacBook Pro sporting Intel’s Kaby Lake processor, a 12-inch MacBook with a faster CPU, and a 13-inch MacBook Air. We’ve heard reliable information about new iOS devices, as well. KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo told his clients to expect a new 10.5-inch iPad Pro model to complement the current 9.7-inch and the 12.9-inch models.

 Expect Apple's first smart speaker to take on Amazon Echo later this year Kif Leswing May 31, 2017, 4:04 PM 2,020 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple's last speaker product, Apple Hi-Fi, which launched in 2006.Flickr/teezeh Apple has started manufacturing its long-rumored smart speaker, and it could start shipping the gadget later this year, according to a published report.  The speaker, which will go up against Amazon's Echo and Google Home, will use Siri, the voice assistant software on the iPhone and Mac, according to the report from Bloomberg, which was published on Wednesday. Like its rivals, Apple's screenless speaker will answer users' questions, turn on smart lights or lock automatic door locks on command, and play music.  Apple hopes to distinguish its gadget with superior sound quality. The speaker will sport "virtual" surround-sound technology and will work with Apple services such as Apple Music, according to Bloomberg. Indeed, the company's impetus for producing a smart speaker may be to help it lock users to those paid services. CEO Tim Cook has recently touted Apple's online services business, which also includes iCloud and its App Store, as a growth engine for the company. The Siri speaker is being manufactured by Inventec, the same company that makes the Apple's AirPods, according to KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. The wireless earbuds have been a surprise hit for Apple. Although the company hasn't released sales numbers for the AirPods, they have been backordered on its website since they first went on sale.  WWDC, Apple's annual conference for software developers, is scheduled to kick off next Monday. The iPhone maker is expected to unveil new hardware there, including updated laptops and iPads.

Apple has begun manufacturing the speaker and could find its debut at this year’s WWDC 2017, according to Bloomberg. Bloomberg sources stated that the Apple smart speaker will differ from its competitors by bringing in “virtual surround sound technology” and deep integration with Apple’s current lineup. Prototype testing began months ago as Bloomberg also previously reported. The manufacturing company behind Apple’s AirPods will also be responsible for building out the new speaker. According to Bloomberg sources, the audio technology within the speaker is what Apple hopes will give it the competitive advantage. Sources also shared that the speakers are louder and “reproduce sound more crisply” then rivals, and that Apple has considered measuring room acoustics to adjust sound levels. As the smart home speaker battle continues, different companies are vying for competitive advantages. While the Amazon Echo and Google Home have become a staple for many, new competitors like the Essential Home shows the market is still new. By bringing a smart home speaker to market, Apple will be able to tightly integrate it within its own ecosystem of services. In a note to investors earlier this year, Amit Daryanani shared that he believes Apple’s services category could become a $50 billion business by the end of 2020 fiscal year. If Apple is to truly track in that direction, competing within the home will be a major step. HomeKit is already a significant addition in Apple’s ecosystem, but a smart speaker would bring Apple’s Siri assistant home. Integrating neatly within services like HomeKit and Apple Music would make the speaker all the more attractive. As different rumors have heated up around the speaker, we put together everything we currently know. Apple’s developer conference is set to kick off next week unveiling MacBook upgrades, a potentially new 10.5-inch iPad, and new iOS, watchOS, tvOS, and macOS updates across the board.

While Elgato has diversified into other Bluetooth HomeKit accessories such as light switches and outlets, the company returns to its roots with Eve Degree, essentially a redesigned and more elegant version of Eve Weather that not only reports temperature, humidity, and air pressure data to HomeKit, but provides an LCD display for viewing this information, and looks good while doing it. The first thing we noticed about Eve Degree is that it’s significantly smaller than we expected. While Eve Weather certainly wasn’t huge, Elgato has managed to shrink the size down of Eve Degree to about a quarter of that of its predecessor — 2.1” on each side and 0.6” deep — while still fitting an LCD display inside. This is probably also helped somewhat by the switch from AA batteries to a CR2450 coin battery, which Elgato promises offers about a year of battery life. There’s not much to the Eve Degree hardware; the face is dominated by a non-backlit LCD display surrounded on the sides by an anodized aluminum frame. On the rear you’ll find the battery cover, a button for switching modes or resetting the device, and a hole for mounting Eve Degree on a wall or other surface. Eve Degree also has the same IPX3 waterproof rating as Eve Weather, so you can mount it outside. The HomeKit pairing code is located on a sticker on the bottom edge, as well as in the accompanying quick start guide; the sticker can be easily peeled off once you’ve paired the device with HomeKit. Eve Degree works right out of the box as a simple digital thermometer/hygrometer thanks to the integrated LCD display; even without pairing it with HomeKit, the button on the back will toggle between displaying temperature in celsius, temperature in fahrenheit, and relative humidity. The device however also becomes immediately discoverable over Bluetooth for the usual HomeKit pairing process. While this can be accomplished through Apple’s iOS 10 Home app or any other third-party HomeKit app, this is a situation where it’s really best to use Elgato’s own Eve app as it provides the ability to set the elevation for accurate air pressure measurements — this can be dialed in manually or set automatically based on your current location. As a HomeKit device, Eve Degree works in exactly the same manner as Eve Weather, providing temperature and humidity information that can be viewed in Apple’s Home app or many third-party HomeKit apps, queried via Siri, or used as conditions or triggers in automation rules (so you could, for instance, adjust a HomeKit thermostat or turn on a fan outlet based on temperature). Unfortunately, HomeKit still leaves out support for air pressure data, so as with Eve Weather you’ll still need to go into the Eve app to see this information. That said, you’ll probably want to use Elgato’s Eve app anyway, as it also provides the ability to track environmental conditions over time in visual graphs by hour, day, week, or month, compare data from different time periods, and even export data so you can pull it into a spreadsheet or use it elsewhere. It’s worth noting that as with all of Elgato’s other Eve devices, Eve Degree uses a Bluetooth Low Energy connection, rather than Wi-Fi. This has the advantage of allowing it to be battery-operated, but it does come with some range limitations. That said, Bluetooth LE generally has a much longer range than traditional Bluetooth speakers or headsets, and we couldn’t find anywhere in our medium-sized house or even our back deck where Eve Degree couldn’t reach the Apple TV home hub in our living room; on the other hand, if you’re looking to use it farther out in your back yard, or you have a larger house, you may want to wait until some of the recently announced HomeKit Bluetooth range extenders become available. Taken purely as a sensor, Eve Degree doesn’t bring anything new to the table compared to Eve Weather — both devices can provide the same temperature, humidity, and air pressure information, and looking at the data or your iPhone you’d be hard pressed to tell the difference between the two. However, a major advantage of Eve Degree is the built-in LCD display that allows you to see temperature or humidity information at a glance without having to resort to pulling out your iPhone, and we also can’t understate how much more attractive the design of is either — it’s a significant improvement over Eve Weather’s more utilitarian look. Eve Weather remains a solid solution for anybody who just wants to collect weather data into HomeKit, but Eve Degree builds on that feature set with a more elegant device that lets you also see current conditions at a glance, eliminating the need for a separate digital thermometer/hygrometer. Further, now that Apple’s HomeKit technology has caught up with actually being able to use the information these sensors can provide to automatically control other HomeKit accessories, Elgato’s entire Eve sensor lineup has become eminently more useful.

The speaker could be unveiled as early as next week at the company’s WWDC conference, but may not ship until later this year. Apple didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Apple’s speaker is going to use the company’s Siri assistant, and will be capable of controlling internet-connected appliances through Apple’s HomeKit platform, according to the report. The device will reportedly also offer simulated surround sound. There have been reports for some time that Apple may be ready to enter the smart speaker space, a market that has thus far been dominated by Amazon and its Alexa assistant. The company has been dabbling more actively in the audio space ever since it acquired Beats in 2014. In fact, Beats was already working on an internet-connected speaker when the company got acquired by Apple. That product was designed to more closely resemble a Sonos-like Wifi-connected device without a smart assistant, and was killed by Apple following the acquisition. Variety was first to report about that project in 2015. Apple has invited developers to its annual WWDC conference next week, where it is expected to also introduce new versions of iOS and OS X. However, industry sources have told Variety that the company likely won’t show off a new version of its Apple TV device until later this year.

Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman has learned from people familiar with the matter that the new smart home appliance won’t be ready to ship until later in the year. However, Apple could debut the gadget during next Monday’s keynote presentation at WWDC. People who have seen it told Bloomberg that the product won’t have a touchscreen, unlike what KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo speculated. Taipei-based AirPods manufacturer Inventec has been tapped as the sole manufacturer of the Siri speaker. Bloomberg previously reported that Apple employees have been secretly testing the device in their homes for several months. The forthcoming Siri gadget reached an advanced prototype stage late last year. Apple is reportedly seeking to differentiate the Siri speaker from Amazon Echo and Google Home by offering virtual surround sound technology, Apple Music and other integrations. The Siri speaker would also act as a HomeKit hub to let users remotely control smart home appliances such as lights, door locks and window blinds, a feature that currently requires either a fourth-generation Apple TV or an iPad. Here’s an excerpt form the article: Along with generating virtual surround sound, the speakers being tested are louder and reproduce sound more crisply than rival offerings, sources in the know said. Apple has also considered including sensors that measure a room’s acoustics and automatically adjust audio levels during use, one of the people said. “This will be a platform for developing Apple’s services,” says Gene Munster of Loup Ventures. Gurman speculated the Siri device could be tucked into Apple’s $11 billion “Other Products” category along with other devices like Apple Watch, Apple TV, AirPods and Beats accessories. Apple declined to comment. Siri speaker mockup via iFunnyVlogger on Twitter.

Wednesday, May 31, 2017 [Tweets] [Favorites] A Year of Google Maps & Apple Maps Justin O’Beirne (Hacker News): According to Google Analytics, that essay has received more than 1,000 hits from computers on Apple’s corporate network, mainly Apple’s Sunnyvale and Cupertino campuses. Yet nearly a year later, Patricia’s Green still isn’t green. […] Google has distinct locations for each. But Apple plots them at the same location... […] ...and as the months pass by, Apple cycles through all three – padding our addition/removal counts[…] […] Speaking of place labels, did you notice that halfway through the year, Google’s changed in appearance? […] And in addition to the color changes, Google also flattened the map – eliminating the coastline dropshadows it had added just a couple years ago and removing most of the road casings[…] […] And speaking of places, Google has also been increasing the variety of places it shows. Nick Heer: I hope Apple’s on-the-ground data collection indicates that they’re pushing for a big improvement soon. But, while they may be working really hard, Google’s designers and engineers aren’t twiddling their thumbs either, and Google is starting with a much stronger base. This article is so good that Apple could almost use it as a todo list. And they probably should. O’Beirne was apparently the “Head of Cartography” at Apple, but given this essay and the one last year, it sounds like he no longer works there.

After reading her note Apple Music changed their policy and in light of the company deciding to pay artists during the trial period, Taylor has allowed her LP 1989 to stream with them. “After the events of this week, I've decided to put 1989 on Apple Music...and happily so,” she wrote on Twitter Thursday. “In case you're wondering if this is some exclusive deal like you've seen Apple do with other artists, it's not. “This is simply the first time it's felt right in my gut to stream my album. Thank you, Apple, for your change of heart.” In her Tumblr letter, Taylor explained she was fighting more for up-and-coming artists than herself. Within 24 hours of the blog entry going viral, Apple’s senior vice president of internet services and software Eddy Cue announced a change in policy. "When I woke up and read Taylor's note, it solidified quickly that we needed a change," Eddy told Rolling Stone. "Music is a big part of our DNA and we always strive to make sure artists are paid for their work." Taylor was thrilled by the confirmation and immediately took to her own page on the social media site to express her joy. "I am elated and relieved. Thank you for your words of support today. They listened to us," she wrote last weekend. Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Entertainment Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry! There was a problem. Please try again.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « The Day after the Essential 'Phone' Unveiling we take a Peek at their Patents and a Possible Future Project | Main | A Major Roundup of the Latest Samsung Smartphone Designs from the U.S Patent Office » May 31, 2017 HP Chooses Microsoft's Cortana for their new Smart Home Speaker Device as Revealed at Computex   Earlier this month Patently Apple posted a report titled "AI Wars are almost reaching Fever Pitch with new Home Devices and Apple Fans look to WWDC 2017 for Apple's Response" Apple fans are hoping that they'll see a new home device from Apple that will compete directly with Amazon's Echo-Show, Google Home and a barrage of new devices headed for the market this fall. Today we're learning that Microsoft's Cortana was chosen by HP for their new home speaker device launching later this year.   According to C/NET, "HP first announced earlier this month that it would be building a Cortana speaker just days after the Harmon Kardon Invoke was shown off. At the time, the concept was very under wraps, but at today's keynote address at the Computex conference, Microsoft unveiled some artist renders of the device.   The speaker will serve as an input device for Microsoft's Cortana virtual assistant, which looks to be making yet another play for the smart home -- territory firmly held by Amazon's Alexa and Google Home."   Last Friday I noted in a report that even Samsung has a home device on the drawing board that they won a design patent for that will be backed by their digital assistant 'Bixby.'   With Apple being caught off-guard with the introduction of the original Echo device that took digital assistants to a new level, they'll be one of the last to get onboard this device trend. Will Apple join this wave or buck it? We may very well get the answer to that question as early as Apple's WWDC keynote scheduled for June 5.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Even apps that have versions for both iOS and Android are generally better on the iPhone to me. There’s still an opportunity for Apple to let you do more with those great third-party apps, however, like replacing stock apps and making them easier to launch… Sony A6500 This is one area where the Mac is just more mature than iOS. You can use Google Chrome or any other web browser as the default app that macOS uses when you click a link, but that’s still not possible on iOS. The same is true for email where the Mac can ignore Apple Mail if you assign a third-party app like Airmail as your default mail client, but you can’t assign Airmail for iOS as your default email app. Apple appeared to be setting the stage for allowing third-party apps to replace stock apps when it added the ability to delete (okay, really just hide) stock apps from the Home screen, but you just can’t use an email link if you don’t have Apple Mail enabled even if you only use a third-party app. This could work by apps assigning a category like browser or calendar or camera, then only those apps in each category could be default options. Behind-the-scenes, it could be more complicated, but that’s as much as the user should need to know. I would also love to be able to assign the apps and functions currently on Control Center. When you swipe up on the iPhone, you see four options: flashlight, timer, calculator, and camera. I use flashlight regularly but the other three go unused most of the time for me. I take tons of photos, but I usually raise-to-wake and swipe over from the right to launch the Camera on the lock screen most of the time. Apple already mixes specific functions and general app launching in Control Center, and both options could exist with customization added. I’d love to put Apple TV Remote and maybe Sonos Controller in Control Center, and a third-party camera like the new Halide app would be way better if it could be launched as fast as the default Camera. Timer is an interesting example in Control Center, too, because it launches a specific tab of the Clock app. The other way to do this from the Home screen is to 3D Touch on the Clock app icon and pick Start Timer. This same concept could be applied to any app with 3D Touch Quick Actions. Visually, the current Control Center uses special glass-like icons for the four apps and dropping the default app icon in that place would look wrong. Apple already supports a different icon type with actions in the Share Sheet, however, so apps could include Control Center icons too without changing how it looks now.

Apple designed the Safari Technology Preview to test features that may be introduced into future release versions of Safari. Safari Technology Preview release 31 includes fixes and improvements for Web API, Javascript, Layout and Rendering, CSS Grid, Font Variations, Web Inspector, Media, Web Driver, WebCrypto, and Security. The Safari Technology Preview update is available through the Software Update mechanism in the Mac App Store to anyone who has downloaded the browser. Full release notes for the update are available on the Safari Technology Preview website. Apple's aim with Safari Technology Preview is to gather feedback from developers and users on its browser development process. Safari Technology Preview can run side-by-side with the existing Safari browser and while designed for developers, it does not require a developer account to download.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars TRANSPORTATION How Apple CarPlay radically improves this small sport utility vehicle John Brandon@jmbrandonbb May 31, 2017 12:10 PM Image Credit: Chevy Simplicity in design. That’s what has made Apple the powerhouse it is today. Things just work. Not every product lives up to this lofty ideal (don’t get me started on the Apple Watch), but many of them do, including the iPhone, the MacBook, and the iPad. One of the somewhat overlooked product segments where Apple has played a big role recently is with CarPlay, the syncing technology it provides to automakers like Ford and GM. When you connect your iPhone using a USB cable, you see a series of icons on the car display. You can quickly select from your music library, activate Siri, and check your text messages by voice. Recently, I tested CarPlay in a small sport utility vehicle, the redesigned 2017 Chevy Trax. This nimble compact SUV, similar to the Honda CR-V, has a base price of $21,000. It’s designed to fit into small spaces, like the parking spot I found at Barnes and Noble and in my own garage. I’ve tested CarPlay before, but not with quite so many passengers. I took three people on a spin around the Twin Cities, demonstrating all of the features so they could give me their impressions. None of them knew anything about CarPlay, but they are all iPhone users. They didn’t realize you could talk to Siri and play an artist by speaking the name. In many cars over the past 10 years or so, that doesn’t always work. You say “Coldplay” and the car hears something completely different. What makes CarPlay and Siri so effective in this particular vehicle is that it’s more of an entry-level vehicle — Chevy makes no bones about that. At $21,000, it’s not supposed to be a luxury SUV. That means you do hear road noise. Yet, in multiple tests all day, Siri never missed a command. I asked about destinations several times, and the car understood me perfectly every time. I also asked about a place to eat for lunch (Green Mill’s pizza is the best) and had no problems. When I had a passenger in the backseat try it, asking about directions back to an office, it also worked. In many ways, accuracy is a safety issue. When a car can’t understand you, it get frustrating and you get distracted. When you know it will work, you keep your eyes facing forward, hands on the wheel. You punch a button on the steering wheel (long press to activate Siri) and it works without any complications. Everyone liked the easy nav as well. During one trip, we were able to play music off my iPhone 7 Plus and could still hear the turn prompts easily. One tap on the 7-inch screen, new for this model year, and the voice guidance stopped so we could use visual cues. I had no trouble browsing my music (including recently additions), listening to my text messages, replying to them by voice, and even streaming Pandora from my phone. CarPlay worked so well it made the Trax more enjoyable to drive and even safer during my day trip. For a lower-priced vehicle, it made an even bigger impact in terms of making technology easier to use. Above: VB Profiles Connected Cars Landscape.

The Galaxy Note 8 and the iPhone 8 – or iPhone Pro, if you prefer – are rumored to come with displays that cover nearly their entire frontside. As for the Essential Phone – we found out earlier this week that Andy Rubin wants to bring the fight right to the doorsteps of both of the biggest names in mobile. First we’ll have a peek at the specifications of the Essential Phone. Because this device has been revealed by the Essential company officially, we have a pretty good idea of what’ll actually end up being inside. This is a device that aims to break with the past by offering some of the most hearty specifications ever packed into a smartphone. Essential Phone (Official) • Display: 5.71-inch 2560 x 1312 (2K) CGS/LTPS • Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 • RAM: 4GB • Internal Storage: 128GB • Camera: Dual 13 MP, RGB / Mono camera with “image fusion technology”, f/1.85 lens, Phase Detection, IR Laser Assist Focus, 4K video at 30fps, 1080p 60fps, 720p 120fps • Front-Camera: 8 MP, f/2.2 lens 4K video at 30fps, 1080p 60fps, 720p 120fps• Battery: 3000 mAh • Battery: 3040mAh • Connectivity: USB-C, Bluetooth 5, Wi-Fi, 4G LTE, 3G, nanoSIM, NFC • Additional: Fingerprint Scanner, 6 Gbps Wireless Accessory Connector, 2x accessory power pins As such, the Essential Phone isn’t particularly cheap. The one model – with 128GB of internal storage – will cost a cool $700 – or around $750 with a magnetic 360-degree camera add-on accessory. The Essential Phone will come in four colors, starting with black, white, and gray, followed later by a green called “Ocean Depths.” Next is the iPhone 8, or iPhone OLED, or iPhone Pro, or iPhone Edition – whatever you’d like to call it. This smartphone has not yet been revealed by Apple, but we’ve seen plenty of leaks about it. This would be the most extravagant iPhone ever released by Apple, and the most powerful of the three models made available in the year 2017. Apple iPhone 8 (OLED MODEL) (Hypothetical) • Display: 5.8-inch OLED display • Processor: Apple A11 chip • RAM: 4GB • Internal Storage: 64GB, 128GB • Camera: Dual 12 MP, (28mm, f/1.8, OIS & 56mm, f/2.8), phase detection autofocus, 2x optical zoom, quad-LED (dual tone) flash • Front-Camera: 7 MP, f/2.2, 32mm, 1080p@30fps, 720p@240fps, face detection, HDR, panorama • Battery: 3000 mAh • Connectivity: Lightning Connector, Bluetooth 5, Wi-Fi, 4G LTE, 3G, nanoSIM, NFC • Additional: Hidden Fingerprint Scanner, Iris Scanner, IP68 water/dust resistance, Wireless Charging As it is with the specs below, the iPhone 8 specs we have here are based on rumors and anonymous tips. We do not yet have the full picture – nor does anyone else outside of Apple’s own design teams. It’s possible Apple might not even release a third iPhone this year, and just stick with the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus – two more phones that have not yet been officially revealed by Apple. Details aren’t quite as mysterious with Samsung’s next major smartphone release, but the device remains in the “not quite official” pile for now regardless. Samsung will likely reveal the Galaxy Note 8, as it’s probably called, at or around the same time as the Galaxy Note 7 was revealed – August of 2016 then, August of 2017 now. Samsung Galaxy Note 8 Specifications (Hypothetical) • Display: 6.2-inch Super AMOLED Quad HD+ display (2960×1440, 529ppi) • Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 PRO processor (if they make one) • RAM: 6GB • Internal Storage: 64GB, 128GB • Camera: 12 MP, f/1.7, 26mm, phase detection autofocus, OIS, LED flash, 8MP secondary • Front-Camera: 8 MP, f/1.7, autofocus, 1440p@30fps, dual video call, Auto HDR • Battery: 4000mAh • Connectivity: USB-C, Bluetooth 5, Wi-Fi, 4G LTE, 3G, nanoSIM, NFC • Additional: Hidden Fingerprint Scanner, Iris Scanner, IP68 water/dust resistance, Wireless Charging If what we thought of the Galaxy Note 7 was any indication, the Galaxy Note 8 will be one of (if not THE) most excellent Android of the year. We’ll have to see whether it’s ready to take on the futuristic ways of the Essential Phone when both are actually out in the open, for sale, and on the market. Pricing on the Galaxy Note 8 will probably match that of the Galaxy Note 7 – or surpass it somewhat. The Galaxy Note 7 was released for around $880 off-contract with 64GB of internal storage. The iPhone 7 Plus with 32GB of internal storage costs $770 USD right now off-contract, while the 128GB version costs $870 USD. That might be a good place to look for a starting price for the iPhone 8/OLED/PRO. The iPhone with OLED display will aim at a completely different crowd from the Galaxy Note 8. The Galaxy Note 8 will attract the fans its had before, plus those that’ve been waiting to get their Note back since last year’s fiasco. Without a stylus, the Essential Phone isn’t quite what the Galaxy Note will be – but it might end up being more attractive to those looking for something that feels a bit more new than Samsung’s tried-and-true Note formula. It all begins later this month when the first of these three – the Essential Phone – is released to the public!

Required fields are marked * Comment Some HTML is OK Sign me up for the Money Morning newsletter Name * Email * Website four  +  7  =  When you pick up shares of the best dividend stocks to buy now, you get two things – profits as share prices rise, and cash. As you know, companies that have dividend policies pay you money each quarter just for holding their stock. You can take the cash or reinvest it (which is an incredibly profitable strategy that we outline for you in this video). Video How Do Dividend Reinvestment Programs (DRIPs) Work? The best dividend stocks (like the ones we're about to show you here) also outperform the broader stock market because they're financially stable. For example, one of the most stable and popular dividend stocks is McDonald's Corp. (NYSE: MCD). Shares of this company are known for being unaffected by broader market volatility. During the financial crisis that lasted roughly from Aug. 10, 2007, to March 6, 2009, the Dow Jones plunged 46.8%. On the other hand, MCD stock actually gained 7.4% over the same period. McDonald's is also a "dividend aristocrat." This refers to an S&P 500 company that's hiked its dividend at least 25 years in a row. The company has gone far beyond that minimum and raised its dividend once a year for the last 40 years. It last hiked its dividend by 5.6% on Nov. 29, 2016, from a quarterly payout of $0.89 per share to $0.94. That gave the stock a yield of 3.1% — the highest since November 2015. But dividend investing isn't as simple as picking any popular dividend aristocrat, buying the stock, and sitting back. Our Money Morning investing gurus select dividend stocks not only because they have a large dividend, but also because they're poised to keep that large dividend going forward. This ability to maintain payouts to shareholders comes from the company's presence in a strong and profitable market, which will also lead to share-price appreciation over time. Here are seven of the best dividend stocks to buy this year… Best Dividend Stocks to Buy No. 7: Magellan Midstream Partners LP Company: Magellan Midstream Partners LP Share Price: $72.79 Quarterly Dividend Payment: $0.87 Dividend Yield: 4.8% Date of First Dividend Payment: April 27, 2001 One of Money Morning Global Energy Strategist Dr. Kent Moors' favorite energy stocks also happens to boast a strong dividend – Magellan Midstream Partners LP (NYSE: MMP). Magellan is a master limited partnership (MLP), which is a company that makes 90% of its total revenue from oil or other natural resources and usually operates in the midstream sector. In other words, it stores and transports oil instead of producing (upstream) or selling (downstream). Because MLPs only rely on transporting and storing oil, they make money regardless of how oil prices are performing. As long as the oil keeps flowing, companies like Magellan keep raking in revenue. As the WTI crude oil price fell 5.8% during Q1 2017, Magellan posted income of $222.7 million. That was up 7.6% from $207 million in the year-ago quarter. But one of the biggest reasons we like Magellan in 2017 is its strong presence in the $1 trillion "Permania" oil boom. That refers to the insane output growth happening right now in the Permian Basin, which stretches across New Mexico and Texas. The U.S. Geological Survey reported in 2016 there were as many as 20 billion barrels of oil in just one region of the Permian Basin. Since Magellan is one of North America's largest oil transporters with 10,000 miles of pipelines, it stands to earn millions in revenue from this massive oil boom. Magellan is also adding roughly 1.7 million barrels of new oil capacity to its pipelines that stretch from the Permian to its Gulf Coast facilities. In other words, Magellan will be making a lot more money with newly expanded transportation capacity. The company already has a huge 36.4% profit margin, meaning 36.4% of Magellan's revenue becomes profit. As revenue increases from the Permian boom, the firm's big profit margin ensures profits will increase as well. According to a survey of Thomson Reuters analysts, MMP stock could rise 23.6% from its current $72.79 price to $90 by May 2018. And the Magellan dividend makes this an even stronger investment. It currently boasts an annual dividend of $3.48 for a yield of 4.8%. That's more than double the average 1.93% yield of the entire S&P 500. Magellan's combination of a 23.6% return and 4.8% yield make it one of the best oil dividend stocks to invest in this year. Best Dividend Stocks to Buy No. 6: American Water Works Co. Inc. Company: American Water Works Co. Inc. Share Price: $77.93 Quarterly Dividend Payment: $0.41 Dividend Yield: 2.13% Date of First Dividend Payment: Aug. 13, 2008 Freshwater is a much scarcer resource than people realize, and American Water Works Co. Inc. (NYSE: AWK) is the best way to make big returns from the growing problem. Although 70% of the Earth is covered in water, only about 2.5% of it is usable for bathing, drinking, and cooking. National Geographic also estimates that only 0.007% of the Earth's water is available to the global population of 7.5 billion people. This chart shows just how bad the problem could become… As you can see, time is quickly running out to solve the problem. According to data from the United Nations, there will be 40% less water than we need by 2030 if the problem continues at its current rate. This – combined with the global population projected to increase by 29% to 9.7 billion people by 2050 – could turn the freshwater problem into a full-blown crisis. This freshwater scarcity ties into two of Money Morning Keith Fitz-Gerald's "Unstoppable Trends." You see, the trick to making huge profits is to find "must-have" companies that fall into what Keith calls the six Unstoppable Trends: medicine, technology, demographics, scarcity and allocation, energy, and war, terrorism, and ugliness (also known as defense). The Unstoppable Trends are backed by trillions of dollars that Washington cannot derail, the Fed cannot meddle with, and Wall Street cannot hijack. The Unstoppable Trends we're targeting here are "demographics and scarcity/allocation." The demographics trend ties into the massive population growth projected by the UN. Meanwhile, the scarcity/allocation trend ties into the simple fact that Earth's resources – especially water – will run out eventually. And every resource shortage always creates a transfer of wealth that opens up huge profit opportunities for investors who know where to look. That's why Keith's recommended investing in AWK stock since December 2011. American Water Works is the largest public water utility company in the United States and serves 15 million people. It provides maintenance for wastewater facilities and sewer lines that transport water across the country. If you bought AWK stock near $31.20 in December 2011 and held it until $77.93 today, you'd have a 149.8% return. Those returns will only keep growing thanks to the company's presence in a market with everlasting demand. "American Water Works is a rock-solid choice that will shield you from market volatility," Keith said. The quarterly AWK dividend has also grown considerably over the last six years. In fact, it's nearly doubled from $0.23 per share in December 2011 to $0.41 today, currently boasting a 2.13% yield. Since its IPO in April 2008, American Water Works has raised its dividend every single year. The AWK dividend even saw double-digit increases every year between 2013 and 2016, rising 12%, 11%, 10%, and 10%, respectively. Best Dividend Stocks to Buy No. 5: Apple Inc. Company: Apple Inc. Share Price: $153 Quarterly Dividend Payment: $0.63 Dividend Yield: 1.65% Date of First Dividend Payment: Nov. 21, 1988 Yes, its 32.2% return to $153 a share this year has made it one of the most profitable tech stocks of 2017. But Apple Inc. (Nasdaq: AAPL) also boasts one of the strongest dividends on the market despite problems with its dividend policy in the past. You see, Apple paid steady dividends from 1988 to 1995. Over that time period, the quarterly payout increased 20% from $0.10 per share to $0.12. However, the company started mounting huge losses mainly due to the sales failure of the Newton, a line of personal digital assistants that sucked $100 million out of Apple during the mid-1990s. When co-founder Steve Jobs returned to the company in 1997, the dividend policy was nixed so Apple could start growing its cash reserves. By August 2012, Apple's cash reserves had reached around $100 billion. That was when the firm decided to reinstate its dividend at $0.38 per quarter – more than triple its last $0.12 quarterly payout 17 years prior. The quarterly AAPL dividend currently sits at $0.63 per share. With that, Apple is one of the only leading tech companies to pay a dividend. Other giants like Alphabet Inc. (Nasdaq: GOOGL), Amazon.com Inc. (Nasdaq: AMZN), and Facebook Inc. (Nasdaq: FB) don't have dividend policies. That's one reason Money Morning Capital Wave Strategist Shah Gilani considers Apple stock one of the best value stocks to buy. But it's undoubtedly proved to be a great growth stock as it's gained 17.2% to $153 since Shah re-recommended it on Feb. 7, when shares traded at $130.54. "Apple Inc. keeps defying gravity," Shah told Money Morning readers on Feb. 7. "Its most recent earnings story was just extraordinary. Records are just being blown away left and right. And, believe it or not (and you'd better believe it), the stock is still cheap." Apple's share appreciation and generous dividend compared to other tech titans makes it more than worth your money this year. Best Dividend Stocks to Buy No. 4: Scotts Miracle-Gro Co. Company: Scotts Miracle-Gro Co. Share Price: $86.32 Quarterly Dividend Payment: $0.50 Dividend Yield: 2.32% Date of First Dividend Payment: Aug. 16, 2005 Founded in 1868, Scotts Miracle-Gro Co. (NYSE: SMG) manufactures and sells a wide variety of garden products. The uses for its line of products have traditionally included insect control, lawn fertilization, gardening, and landscaping. While it's long been a leader in the gardening and lawn-care market, Scotts Miracle-Gro has recently been pushing into the marijuana sector. This is one of the biggest reasons why Money Morning Director of Tech & Venture Capital Research Michael A. Robinson likes SMG stock. "Scotts is already the world's largest maker of lawn-care and gardening products, and is now making a big push into indoor plant cultivation, as evidenced by its April 2015 $150 million purchase of General Hydroponics and other pot-related acquisitions," Robinson said in November 2016. Must Read: Former Google Exec Quits Dream Job to Launch Marijuana Empire The explosive growth of the marijuana market will be a huge catalyst for the SMG stock price. According to New Frontier Data's 2017 Cannabis Industry Annual Report, medical marijuana sales are expected to soar from $4.7 billion last year to $13.3 billion by 2020. The cannabis industry is also expected to create more than 250,000 jobs in the next three years – more than utilities, manufacturing, or even government jobs. A recent Yahoo Finance survey of analysts show shares of Scotts Miracle-Gro could rise to $105 in the next 12 months. That would be a return of 21.6% from the current price of $86.32. While that may not be a huge profit, SMG stock more than makes up for it with a yield of 2.32% and quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share. The firm's dividend has increased every year since 2013, rising 13.6% from $0.44 to $0.50. The SMG dividend is also bigger than those offered by close peers Central Garden & Pet Co. (Nasdaq: CENT) and Andersons Inc. (Nasdaq: ANDE). Central Garden doesn't offer a dividend, while Andersons only pays $0.16 per share for a 1.82% yield. Best Dividend Stocks to Buy No. 3: Lockheed Martin Corp. Company: Lockheed Martin Corp. Share Price: $279.88 Quarterly Dividend Payment: $1.82 Dividend Yield: 2.6% Date of First Dividend Payment: May 25, 1995 With shares currently at an all-time high and expected to go higher, Lockheed Martin Corp. (NYSE: LMT) is one of the best defense stocks to own that also happens to have a strong dividend. On Monday, May 22, LMT stock climbed 1.5% to a record high of $276.92. The gains came after President Trump made a deal with Saudi Arabia for the country to purchase more than $28 billion worth of missiles, Black Hawk helicopters, and other defense weapons from Lockheed. The Saudi government agreed to spend $110 billion overall on defense contracts, which also lifted shares of peers Raytheon Co. (NYSE: RTN) and Boeing Co. (NYSE: BA). Lockheed Martin stock is up 18.5% since May 2016 thanks mostly to Trump's promise to increase military spending by $54 billion. That – combined with clearly strong international demand for the company's products – could send the LMT stock price soaring this year. Money Morning Technical Trading Specialist D.R. Barton consistently recommends Lockheed Martin stock. Since his last recommendation on May 10, 2016, shares have gained 12.7% from $244.36 to the current price of $279.88. But shares still have more room to run. Analysts say the stock could rise to $330 per share by May 2018. This would represent a 17.9% return for investors if they buy in at the current price. On top of those solid gains, Lockheed offers shareholders a quarterly dividend of $1.82, good for a 2.6% yield. That beats out the Northrop Grumman Corp. (NYSE: NOC) dividend of $1 (1.55% yield) and United Technologies Corp. (NYSE: UTX) dividend of $0.66 (2.18% yield). With growing demand for defense weapons overseas and a big dividend to boot, LMT is a great investment for both growth and value investors. Best Dividend Stocks to Buy No. 2: Sanofi SA Company: Sanofi SA Share Price: $49.41 Quarterly Dividend Payment: $1.58 Dividend Yield: 3.19% Date of First Dividend Payment: May 28, 2003 Another one of the best dividend stocks to buy in 2017 is France's largest pharmaceutical company – Sanofi SA (NYSE ADR: SNY). This pharma giant – which is also the fifth-largest drugmaker in the world – produces some of the most recognizable and consumed medications on the market. These brands include leukemia treatment Lemtrada and sleeping medication Ambien. Michael Robinson likes Sanofi because of its huge pipeline of blockbuster drugs coming to market. Of the 44 total medications in the pipeline, 13 of them are already in phase 3 clinical trials. According to Michael, about half of those drugs in phase 3 have come from partnerships with other companies. Sanofi's collaboration with other firms is a good way to save cash that could later be used to hike its dividend or fund other projects. "This is something we're seeing more and more of in pharma these days," Michael told Money Morning readers on April 26. "In my view, it's a smart move to help split up the costs and risks of new drug development." But the even bigger catalyst for SNY stock will be the company's expansion into the Chinese market. China already makes up one-third of Sanofi's revenue and is the firm's third-largest buyer behind the United States and France. According to a March 21 report by The Wall Street Journal, the company projects sales in China will increase by at least 10% in 2017. That would be up from a strong 2 billion euros ($2.15 billion) last year. With plans to release more than 10 new drugs in China by 2020, Sanofi is perfectly poised for long-term growth just in that market alone. "Given the relative immaturity of China's biotech and generic drugmakers, it will be years until they stop looking to the West for help managing their pharmaceutical demands," Michael said. "Those years of baked-in growth suit Sanofi just fine." Sanofi provides a dividend of $1.58 per share and has a 3.19% dividend yield. For comparison, the SNY dividend beats out Merck & Co. Inc.'s (NYSE: MRK) $0.47 dividend (2.88% yield) and Johnson & Johnson's (NYSE: JNJ) $0.84 dividend (2.62%). Now, our No. 1 dividend stock pick isn't exactly a traditional stock. It primarily focuses on bonds and income investments rather than goods and services, like the previous six companies. However, this company has the highest yield out of any of our picks, meaning it's the company that's arguably the most dedicated to giving most of its profits back to shareholders. Here's our pick… Join the conversation. Click here to jump to comments… (0) COMMENTS FACEBOOK COMMENTS TAGS Tags: Dividends Leave a Reply Click here to cancel reply.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « AMD Introduces Threadripper at Computex | Main | HP Chooses Microsoft's Cortana for their new Smart Home Speaker Device as Revealed at Computex » May 31, 2017 The Day after the Essential 'Phone' Unveiling we take a Peek at their Patents and a Possible Future Project     Yesterday Andy Rubin's company Essential Products Inc. launched their new Essential 'Phone' with a 5.7" high-end display at 2560 x 1320 and other decent specifications. The company also launched other products like their 'Essential Home' device which is very much like an Amazon Echo device that offers the world's first 5" round display and their own digital assistant. Rubin told Mossberg last night during his Code Conference interview that he's trying to work with Google, Microsoft, Apple and Samsung so that their new home device will also work with the digital assistant of your choice so that you're not locked into only the Essential assistant.    Essential also launched a very innovative 360-degree camera that wirelessly connects to the phone. The accessory is held in place by magnets. Rubin demoed it during his Mossberg interview and it was really cool. He aimed it at the audience and then swiped the screen to see the image rotate a full 360 degrees. Nice accessory for a smartphone or future tablet.   I took some time yesterday afternoon to look up Essential's patents to see if they would reveal anything about their present line-up or possible future products – and this is primarily what this report is about.   The Essential 'Phone' Influenced by LG Display   While Rubin was at Google, he worked with LG display on the LG Nexus 4 released in 2012; the Nexus 5 in 2013; and the Nexus 5X in 2015. Yesterday I was given a tip (by 'Blinx182') that directed me to a 2016 LG Display granted design patent #3008810140000-(2016.11.08) from the South Korean patent office known as Kipris, for a smartphone design that is presented in-part below.   Without a doubt the face of the smartphone is in fact the design that Andy Rubin ran with and his connection to LG is well established. However, the backside of the granted design patent is shown to be completely blank. This is where Essential's secret sauce comes into play via U.S. patent 20170126268.   Essential's patent FIG. 3 noted above depicts various accessories that are attached to user devices that include wireless accessory buses; FIG. 4 includes front, side, rear views of a camera accessory having multiple digital cameras that are capable of capturing a substantially 360 degree field of view.   The mechanics of the face camera system is where Essential spent a lot of time on. In total we found five patents: 20170126868; 20170124377; 20170123454; 20170123453; and 20170123452.   One set of oddball patents stood out showing Essential's engineers were dreaming up an alternative camera design in the form of a pop-up camera found in patent numbers 20170126979, 20170126971 and 20170126937.   Essential Products Inc. Interested in Smart Glasses   In an interview with Wired published yesterday, Rubin mentioned Google Glass by stating that it "failed not because the tech was bad but because the world wasn't ready to wear them." Why did he bring that up? Well, because Essential is working on smart glasses, according to one of the patent filings. The patent figure from that patent is illustrated below.   Essential Product Inc's patent FIG. 5 noted above shows a dual-mode display with a camera placed underneath the display, according to one embodiment. Glasses #500 include one or more lenses #510 and # 520, one or more user facing cameras #530 and #540, and one or more environment facing cameras #550.   Essential engineers in describing the glasses note that "The one or more lenses can be prescription lenses, photosensitive lenses, sunglass-lenses, etc. Each lens in the one or more lenses includes a dual-mode display, with one or more using facing cameras placed within the dual-mode display. The one or more user facing cameras are oriented towards the user, and can track the direction of the user's gaze.   Augmented Reality comes into play with these glasses. Essential notes that "Based on the environment that the user sees, and based on the direction of the user's gaze, the processor can display an image to augment the environment around the user. For example, if the user is looking at a barcode of an item, the processor can display cheaper purchasing options of the same item."   The Essential Philosophy   And lastly, one of the interesting points that were revealed about Essential during the Mossberg interview was that Essential has a connection to a company called Playground. Rubin launched Playground, a venture capital firm where a few dozen engineers and designers at Playground Studios help startups build stuff. Rubin was telling Mossberg that Essential is willing and able to do things Apple won't.   He talked about how an idea from the Playground group, backed by venture capitalists, could make its way into the Essential product line so as to promote a new idea or concept that the big boys like Apple can't take a chance on for their products. Most of these ideas need a starting point prior to building volume / scale so that it could later be appealing to other Android OEMs to add to their smartphone line-up that might give them an advantage over Apple or Samsung.   Later in the Wired interview, Jason Keats, the company's head of product architecture, said that if the Essential 'Phone'' were to sell 50 million units in its debut quarter that they'd be totally screwed, adding that "Essential simply cannot produce that many phones. That's the point. We've gone after technologies and methods of manufacturing that aren't designed to support 50 million devices." Keats told Wired that he wants Essential to think like a high-end watchmaker, not a commodity gadget builder. (Granted, everyone says this, even the commodity gadget builders.) From the start, Essential's designers and engineers met with countless manufacturers in search of the most interesting technology and materials, especially stuff no one could produce at scale. "We're not for everybody," Keats says. "You know it's going to be a little exclusive."   Rubin admitted that of course Essential wants to scale up and be super profitable, but that for now, that's not the priority. The priority is about making cool products with unique features on an open source platform that encourages and promotes new ideas that are reviewed and promoted by the Playground group through Essential Product's platform. So while building a new brand is important, so is giving new ideas a chance to breathe, mature and become popular for Essential and other OEM's who want to adopt the new technologies.   In theory, it's a very interesting approach, though only time will tell if it's one that could survive. In a maturing market like smartphones, Rubin feels that being able to make a product stand out from those from Apple and Samsung will be welcomed by those that are real techies or those who love style and design.   That's why Essential is sticking with Android for hardware. It has the largest market share by far that could ensure that Essential Phone buyers won't miss out on their favorite apps.   At present no patents were found covering Essential's Internet of Things (IoT) OS called Ambient OS.   In the end, Essential is by no means a competitor to Apple. Oddly, if anything, Essential may be more of a threat to other venture capitalist firms. If an inventor has a great hardware idea that is struggling to get off the ground, inventors are likely going to make their pitch to Essential Products Inc. first knowing that it could find its way to market faster.   Then again, Essential has to first prove that consumers have any interest in their products and that's where the rubber meets the road. Taking the flip side of Rubin's analogy, in a maturing market, most consumers tend to stick with what's successful and backed by great service. That's going to be a huge wall for Essential to climb, especially against Apple. On that point, good luck.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

The company has announced Alexa now supports Apple iCloud Calendar, making it easy for users to link their accounts through the settings portion of the Alexa app. Just as with Google and Outlook calendars, Alexa users can now ask: “Alexa, what’s on my calendar.” Folks will also be able to add items to their calendar through voice commands. Related: Best Fire TV tips In a press release Amazon says: “iCloud Calendar support has been a top requested feature from Alexa customers, and we’re thrilled to bring this to Alexa devices in US, UK and Germany today. Now customers have access to five major calendaring services through their Alexa devices.” Those services are iCloud, G Suite, Google/Gmail, Office 365 and Outlook. Amazon, a pioneer in the space, is facing more and more competition from the likes of Google and Microsoft, as well as the new offering from Andy Rubin’s Essential firm. Whether Apple does launch its own voice-controlled digital assistant device next week remains to be seen, but Amazon is prepared. Is the Echo still leading the way? Or is the chasing pack about to overwhelm Alexa? Share your thoughts in the comments section below.

Share Tweet Share Tags : Articles-Articles+ Android-Android+ The tech-obsessed parts of the internet exploded yesterday when Andy Rubin's new company, Essential, debuted its upcoming first smartphone, the Essential Phone, and smart home speaker, the Essential Home. And it's fair to say most people were impressed, if a bit skeptical: even if the devices seem pretty good for a first try, this is, after all, yet another newcomer that tries to reinvent the smartphone in some way. The first thing one might notice when looking at the Essential Phone is its curious design: the large, bezel-less screen's top is cut to make room for the front-facing camera, a concept we've seen in many fan renders in the past, but not in an actual commercial product; while the device's frame is made out of titanium, a material rarely found in smartphones. But then there's also the magnetic accessory pins on the back, which allure to a bright future of effortlessly usable wireless accessories. But here's the thing: while it's hard to argue the Phone has its merits, almost everyone can agree on one thing: with a $700 price tag and several glaring feature omissions, a phone from a startup that is completely unknown to the general consumer simply won't sell that well. But rather than start writing our eulogies just a day after the phone was announced, let's instead examine the situation from a different standpoint: that the Essential Phone wasn't actually made to sell units. Follow the money In almost every industry, when a company does something curious and seemingly illogical (such as releasing a quirky-looking, expensive flagship in an oversaturated market), a good way to find out what exactly its intentions are is to simply follow the money: how and why could such a move benefit said company? So here we need to take a look at Essential – not the products, but the company itself. In an hour-long interview today (embedded above), Andy Rubin shared how Essential, as well as the titular Phone, came to existence. In short, there exists a company called Playground (also founded and led by Rubin himself), which acts as an 'incubator' for tech startups – this is where Essential got its start, as well as part of its initial funding. But here's where things get a little tricky: that startup cash may have been enough to design and launch a duo of new products (trio, if count the 360° camera as well), but it most probably isn't enough to sustain it for much longer after that. Hardware startups need capital more than they need customersAnd with the general problem of hardware startups not having a user base at all, the prospect of relying on sales profits is a pretty far-fetched one – most consumers only trust a couple of brands, and competition in the smartphone market is also especially fierce. So since sales won't make enough of a profit, more capital needs to be raised from investors to ensure the company's continued existence. But while Rubin's reputation may have been enough to raise the initial necessary cash, things should start getting a bit more complicated once an actual product gets launched: this is the stage where all the behind-the-curtain promises can be broken, and so the end product needs to be impressive. That is, few people would happily jump on board to fund yet another company that has only proved itself capable of making boring, cookie cutter devices – there's simply too much competition in this space already. The Apple factor But you know where there isn't competition? Well, you probably do, given that it's written right there in the subtitle. When it comes to smartphones, pretty much every player out there wants to become the next Apple – that's what making the best-selling product of its kind gives you. So it's only natural that Andy Rubin, the man who created Apple's biggest potential threat in the mobile space, would want to take the crown for himself. Or at least, that's what it's supposed to look like on the surface: while most people would tell you that toppling Apple over is entirely unrealistic, their opinion isn't what matters – what matters is the investors' opinion, and they're all desperately looking for the next Apple. So when you really need money, as is Essential's case, but you can't get it without convincing a bunch of very rich people they'll get a good return on their investment – why not focus your product development on proving to them you're the Next Big Thing, rather than hoping to catch the everyday consumer's eye in an already overcrowded market? So when you're looking at the Essential Phone through that lens, the similarities between it and an iPhone become not a coincidence, but rather a deliberate design choice made to appeal to a very specific circle of people. Ten years later, investors are still looking for an iPhone-like success story The unique visual design? One of the iPhone's biggest selling points is the fact that it's good-looking and immediately recognizable. So proving you can make a device that both stands out from the crowd but still looks good is, well, essential. The accessory connector on the back? iPhones have this thing called the Lightning port on the bottom, the ecosystem for which is entirely controlled by Apple, who also conveniently collects a ton of licensing fees from third-party manufacturers. And while Rubin claims the wireless connection is based on the USB standard, he certainly hasn't claimed the specs will be freely available for everyone to use. Or in other words, this is a huge potential cash cow, a thing investors love. Even the omission of a 3.5 mm headphone jack could be viewed as a cheap way to draw subliminal parallels to the iPhone 7, which sold a record number of devices without including one, either. Then there's also the top-of-the-line specs, which prove Essential will be targeting the premium market as well. So combine all these factors and you might just get a recipe for a second round of funding from investors who want a slice of that Apple pie. Sustainability But this is, admittedly, a somewhat simplistic look at Essential's business model – this approach might work for a device generation or two, but is simply not sustainable after that. So the startup also needs to capture an audience as well. Luckily for it, all the design decisions in the Essential Phone also work out to a pretty eye-catching combination as well, and if it plays its cards right, vis-à-vis software, marketing, and carrier distribution deals, users might well start noticing there's a new player in the game. And by generation two, the market might just be ready for them to enter in a serious manner. To do so, however, Essential needs to also build a better next phone, one that plugs the holes present in the current model. This presents a bit of a problem for today's potential buyers, though: when the better, flashier Phone v2 launches, will they be left behind? Essential has so far not taken any stance on software, besides saying that the Phone will run Android, so such a risk is certainly present (though the magnetic accessory connector is said to remain the same in the future). So if one accepts the theory that the Essential Phone isn't initially primed for a straight-out consumer success, buying it becomes a somewhat less enticing proposition – sure, it's an okay device, but it has a couple of big feature omissions and virtually no guarantees of support, both problems that don't exactly fit its $700 price tag. But even if its first phone doesn't turn into a smash hit, as we expect it won't, it'll still be interesting to see what's next in line for the company Editor's pick   Here's a possible iPhone 8 sandwiched between two Galaxies   A new contender appears: meet the Essential Phone Poll: do you care about 360-degree cameras? 31 May Prev news 5 of the best MMO games for Android and iOS (2017) 31 May Next news Close newer posts OnePlus CEO says OnePlus 5 will be "the thinnest flagship phone" 31 May New iPhone camera app bets on pro-level controls, clever interface 31 May Canceled Microsoft Lumia 960 flagship smartphone makes appearance 31 May 5 of the best MMO games for Android and iOS (2017) 31 May Now reading: The Essential Phone was designed to flop The Essential Phone was designed to flop 31 May Poll: do you care about 360-degree cameras? 31 May 5 Essential phone ideas we'd like to see in the next iPhone... and 5 we 31 May It is real: a hands-on with the Essential Phone, presented by Andy Rubin 31 May Bezel-less is not a thing, and here's why it shouldn't be 31 May Sony announced US prices and release dates for the Xperia XZ Premium, Touch, 31 May older posts Related phones Essential Phone Compare Specifications News[14] Rivals Photos Size it Videos Phone Related News   The Essential Phone will (probably) receive monthly security updates   5 Essential phone ideas we'd like to see in the next iPhone... and 5 we don't   Andy Rubin's Essential Phone should be released next month, will feature a new digital assistant   U.S. carriers confirm the Essential Phone will work on their networks, but none will offer it directly (UPDATED)   Here is why the Essential Phone exists: 6 principles that make it different from others   The Essential Phone has a weird cutout display 57 Comments Options Close Follow › Following Show comments: default show moderated comments Display mode: Threaded Chronological Newest first Always view all comments Save 1 2 Next » posted on yesterday, 09:32 10 Reply 1. dubaiboy78 (Posts: 238; Member since: 19 Sep 2014) Camera location in front of screen is f**king ugly! posted on yesterday, 09:56 5 Reply 8.

This smartphone has cat 16 LTE or 1 gigabit, Bluetooth 5, USB-C, QHD display wit 85% screen, dual 13 mp cameras, a 8 mp front facing camera, Android Nougat 7.1. If any phone is missing the essentials, then it's clearly​the iPhone's that are missing. Especially for what Apple's selling price is. Apple is a rip off compared to this smartphone. posted on yesterday, 14:32 0 in response to #33 in response to #33 Hide Reply 40.

The phone, while obviously missing some essentials has everything to be a hit. Futuristic design, sd 835, ufs 2.1, dual cameras, stock android, 128gig storage, 4gig ram, perfect fps placement, made of titanium (which is scratch and shatter resistant) and they still think this phone was designed to flop? Infact, i'd like to know what flagship has been better than the essential in 2017 so far. Is it the the huawei p10? g6? u11? Sony? Op5? MZ2? The gs8 is the only arguable exception tbh.. posted on yesterday, 09:37 1 Reply 4. DoggyDangerous (Posts: 989; Member since: 28 Aug 2015) Which big feature omission it has??

The iphone 4 series was a masterpiece and a design revolution, the iphone 5 series was a design masterpiece, the iphone 6 series is the most popular and most copied phone design of all time and the iphone 8 will most probably push the boundaries and be an all time design revolution too. So stop it with the ignorance. posted on yesterday, 10:42 2 Reply 21. aegislash (Posts: 951; Member since: 27 Jan 2015) Bankz, I agree with you about the iPhone having a great design...but c'mon, man, that's some TechieXP level response right there.

That's like saying the every device with a fingerprint scanner takes inspiration from the Moto Atrix. Sure, HTC did the antenna lines first...but virtually no one else did so, until Apple did it with the 6/6 Plus.

Apple chief executive Tim Cook at WWDC in 2015 Credit: Bloomberg Matthew Field 31 May 2017 • 5:47pm Apple's worldwide developers' conference is happening next week and Tim Cook is due to announce a host of upgrades to its software, as well as a host of anticipated new products. The Cupertino giant is expected to unveil new hardware at the annual event. This could include an iPad and refresh of the MacBook devices. Apple is rumoured to be working on a standalone product to house its virtual assistant Siri, which could be unveiled next week. The announcements will also feature a run down of the next generation of Apple's mobile operating system, iOS 11, as well as an upgrade for its macOS, watchOS and TV OS.     What is WWDC and when is it?  WWDC is Apple's annual developers' conference in California, which has become a platform for the announcement of its latest operating systems and products. The conference starts on June 5 and runs until June 9 at the McEnery Convention Center in San Jose, California. On the first day, Monday, Apple's chief Tim Cook will deliver his keynote speech in which he is expected to reveal the major announcements. The two-hour presentation will start at 10am PST, or 6pm in the UK. Apple WWDC How can I watch the event? You can tune in to Apple's website to watch the presentation live here, or through the WWDC iOS app. The Telegraph will be covering the event live, bringing you the most important news regarding iOS 11 and Apple's new products as it happens. What is Apple going to announce?  While last year's conference focused on software, many tipsters are predicting several hardware announcements from Mr Cook this time around.  Is Apple going to announce the iPhone 8 at WWDC?  Apple is not expected to unveil the iPhone 8 at WWDC, but will probably follow tradition and hold a separate event for the flagship device in September. The company hasn't unveiled a phone at its developers' conference since the iPhone 4 in 2010.  What will the iPhone 8 look like? The event will, however, feature the release of iOS 11, the software due to ship with the iPhone 8 when it goes on sale later this year.  iOS 11 iOS 11 is expected to  feature an update to virtual assistant Siri, as well as a refresh for Apple Music that puts the focus on original video. The recently released Instagram-rival Clips app could also be showcased, as well as an update to Apple Pay that lets users transfer money between iPhones.  For everything we know so far about iOS 11 check out our separate piece here.  Siri Speaker There is little hard news on Apple's rumoured Siri speaker, which is rumoured to be a rival to Amazon's popular Echo speaker, the recently released Echo Show, the Google Home and Samsung's new Harman Kardon speaker. Siri could be in line for an upgrade Bloomberg reported last year that Apple had started testing a prototype voice-controlled smart home device, but the rumour mill has since been fairly quiet regarding the product. Apple released HomeKit back with iOS 8, its app for a network of connected devices, but is yet to launch its own smart home device. New MacBook laptops and computers Apple is reportedly planning to refresh its most of its MacBook lineup at WWDC, fighting off competition from Microsoft, which announced a new Surface Laptop to compete with the MacBook Air. Apple's new MacBook Pro will come with the latest Intel Core i7 Kaby Lake processors, while both the 12-inch MacBook and 13-inch MacBook Air will get updates, according to Bloomberg. The MacBook Air is long overdue a refresh. Although it has not been updated since 2015, it remains one of the company's most popular laptops due to its price. The MacBook Pro range has recently had an availability update on the Apple Store, with orders held on some products until after 5 June. New 10.5-inch iPad Pro The new iPad 2017 has caused renewed speculation of an update to the iPad Pro Credit: Apple Prominent Apple analyst Ming-Chi Quo has been touting a new range of iPads this year. Back in January he predicted new releases this year for 9.7-inch, 10.5-inch and 12.3-inch iPads. The 9.7-inch iPad 2017 was unveiled earlier this year, leading to speculation that a refresh of the iPad Pro line, which was first released back in November 2015, could be on the cards. macOS and other software updates Last year, Apple updated its OS X system to macOS, now in its current 10.12.5 iteration. Apple may introduce a new update for the computer software, speculatively called macOS 10.13, but there are no hard details yet. Apple is likely to also refresh its WatchOS operating system and its TVOS.

Apple Inc., No. 2016-1599 (Fed. Cir. May 11, 2017) In a case of first impression, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has held that a patent owner's statements made in a preliminary statement during an AIA inter partes review (IPR) proceeding may create prosecution disclaimer during subsequent federal court litigation. The court ruled that IPR proceedings are administrative in nature, and the same policies that support disclaimer based on statements made during examination or reexamination proceedings equally apply to statements made during IPR proceedings. Background Aylus Networks, Inc. owns U.S. Patent No. RE 44,412, which covers systems and methods for implementing digital home networks having a control point located on a wide area network. Aylus filed an action against Apple Inc. in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, alleging that Apple's AirPlay feature infringed the '412 patent. Apple responded to the lawsuit by filing two petitions with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office seeking inter partes review of claims in the '412 patent. During the IPR, Aylus filed a preliminary response arguing why Apple's petitions should not be instituted. The preliminary responses included statements concerning one limitation in the '412 patent claims, "wherein the CPP logic is invoked to negotiate media content delivery between the MS and the MR[.]" The Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) instituted review on some challenged claims, but denied review on other claims. After institution, Aylus voluntarily dismissed the district court infringement action as to the claims on which the PTAB instituted review, but continued to litigate two claims as to which the PTAB did not institute review. Apple then filed a motion for summary judgment of noninfringement of the non-instituted claims. Apple argued that the claims should be construed in light of statements Aylus made in its preliminary response to the Patent Office, and under Apple's proposed construction the accused AirPlay device did not infringe. The district court granted summary judgment, adopting Apple's proposed construction of the disputed term and ruling that Aylus' statements in the IPR response were "akin to prosecution disclaimer." Aylus appealed the summary judgment ruling to the Federal Circuit. Federal Circuit Rules that Even IPR Statements May Constitute Disclaimer On appeal, the Federal Circuit affirmed the district court. In a panel decision written by Circuit Judge Stoll, the court held that statements made during IPR proceedings, including in the patent owner's preliminary response, can be used to construe a patent's claims, and may result in a disclaimer of claim scope if the statements are a clear and unmistakable surrender of claim scope. Prosecution disclaimer occurs when a patent owner, through amendment or argument, "unequivocally and unambiguously disavows a certain meaning to obtain a patent[.]" Slip op. at 8, quoting Biogen Idec, Inc. v. GlaxoSmithKline LLC, 713 F.3d 1090, 1095 (Fed. Cir. 2013). In that event, "the doctrine of prosecution history disclaimer narrows the meaning of the claim consistent with the scope of the claim surrendered." Id. The Federal Circuit noted that although prosecution disclaimer first was recognized for statements made during examination, it has been applied in other PTO proceedings, including reissue and reexaminations. The court noted that, "[o]ver time, prosecution disclaimer has become a fundamental precept in our claim construction jurisprudence, which promotes the public notice function of the intrinsic evidence and protects the public's reliance on definitive statements made during prosecution." Slip op. at 9 (quotation omitted). The court ruled that, for the same reasons, statements made during IPR proceedings may result in prosecution disclaimer: It follows that we should apply the doctrine in IPR proceedings before the PTO. Extending the prosecution disclaimer doctrine to IPR proceedings will ensure that claims are not argued one way in order to maintain their patentability and in a different way against accused infringers. In keeping with the underlying purposes of the doctrine, this extension will "promote[] the public notice function of the intrinsic evidence and protect[] the public's reliance on definitive statements made during" IPR proceedings. [Omega Eng'g, Inc. v. Raytek Corp., 334 F.3d 1314, 1324 (Fed. Cir. 2003)]. Slip op. at 10-11 (citation omitted). The court rejected Aylus' arguments to the contrary. First, the court noted that an IPR proceeding is essentially an administrative, not an adjudicative, proceeding, and thus is similar to examination or reexamination. The court observed that in Cuozzo Speed Technologies, LLC v. Lee, 136 S. Ct. 2131 (2016), the Supreme Court characterized IPR proceedings as a "reexamination" or "second look" at an earlier examination. This, the Federal Circuit concluded, Because an IPR proceeding involves reexamination of an earlier administrative grant of a patent, it follows that statements made by a patent owner during an IPR proceeding can be considered during claim construction and relied upon to support a finding of prosecution disclaimer. Slip op. at 12. The appeal court also rejected Aylus' argument that the preliminary statement could not create a disclaimer because it preceded the actual IPR institution decision. For purposes of disclaimer, however, the court found that distinction irrelevant: An IPR proceeding is a two-step process: the Director's decision whether to institute a proceeding, followed (if the proceeding is instituted) by the Board's conduct of the proceeding and decision with respect to patentability. We have said that an "IPR does not begin until it is instituted," Shaw Indus. Grp., Inc. v. Automated Creel Sys., Inc., 817 F.3d 1293, 1300 (Fed. Cir. 2016), but for the purposes of prosecution disclaimer, we find the differences between the two phases of an IPR to be a distinction without a difference. A patent owner's preliminary response filed prior to an institution decision and a patent owner's response filed after institution are both official papers filed with the PTO and made available to the public. In both official papers, the patent owner can define claim terms and otherwise make representations about claim scope to avoid prior art for the purposes of either demonstrating that there is not a reasonable likelihood that the claims are unpatentable on the asserted grounds or demonstrating that the challenger has not shown by a preponderance of the evidence that the claims are unpatentable on the asserted grounds. Regardless of when the statements are made during the proceeding, the public is "entitled to rely on those representations when determining a course of lawful conduct, such as launching a new product or designing-around a patented invention." Biogen, 713 F.3d at 1095. Slip op. at 13-14 (quotation omitted). Finally, the court held that Aylus' statements in the preliminary statements were a clear and unmistakable surrender of claim scope, and thus established a disclaimer for purposes of construing the '412 patent claims. Therefore, the court affirmed the district court's grant of summary judgment. Practical Significance A patent owner faces several strategic decisions during AIA trial proceedings. In many instances, the patent owner's best chance to avoid cancellation of challenged claims is to avoid the institution of review. Thus, many patent owners opt to file preliminary statements arguing that no basis for review exists by distinguishing the claims over the prior art. The Aylus decision points out that this strategy is not without risk because any statement made in a preliminary response, including claim construction arguments, may be used later to construe claim language. The Aylus court's analysis likely applies to all statements made during IPR proceedings, as well as statements made in post grant review and covered business method reviews. In addition, although the Federal Circuit has not addressed the broader issue, patent owners should expect that short of actual disclaimer, all statements made during AIA post grant proceedings, including statements in expert reports, will be considered "intrinsic" evidence that a district court may consider, along with the patent specification and prosecution history, in conducting claim construction.

The update likely includes bug fixes and performance improvements as well as new wallpapers discovered only on the 12.9-inch iPad Pro… Sony A6500 Apple’s public beta program is free to participate in unlike its paid developer program. iOS 10.3.3 will be released to everyone likely next month, and the public beta allows more users to test pre-release versions of the software update before it’s finalized. The presence of new wallpapers only on the 12.9-inch iPad Pro (which you can download here) further suggests what analysts expect: updated iPad Pros may be coming at WWDC on Monday next week. The missing wallpapers on the 9.7-inch iPad models may suggest these will be marketing wallpapers for new 12.9-inch and the first 10.5-inch iPads.

A leaked Eurasian regulatory filing has revealed that the firm will unveil four new iPad Pros, identified with model numbers A1671, A1709, A1670 and A1701. The documents have also highlighted a next-generation wireless keyboard that is believed to be the latest version of Apple’s Magic Keyboard. Leaked Eurasian regulators filings revealed that Apple will unveil four iPad Pros, identified with model numbers A1671, A1709, A1670 and A1701. The documents also highlighted a next-generation Apple’s Magic Keyboard NEW APPLE PRODUCTS  The Russian-language filing shows a model number A1843, which references to a next-generation Apple wireless keyboard and four other numbers (A1671, A1709, A1670 and A1701) that have been speculated to be new iPad Pro models. The wirelesss keyboard would be the predecessor to the Apple Magic Keyboard, which has been unchanged since 2015.  The four new iPads, if set for the event, could be unveiled alongside a 10-in and a 12.9-in  iPad Pro that was rumored earlier this month.  It has also been speculated that Apple will debut its secretive Siri-powered smart speaker at the Worldwide Developers Conference as well.  Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) is set to kick off in San Jose, California on June 5 and last until June 9.  And over the past few months, numerous rumors have flooded the internet with speculations of new products. Now, a Russian-language regulatory filing, in the Eurasian Economic Commission database, has brought even more products to light, 9to5Mac reported. The filing shows a model number A1843, which references to a next-generation Apple wireless keyboard and four other numbers (A1671, A1709, A1670 and A1701) that have been speculated to be new iPad Pro models. Rumors surrounding the possibility of new iPads first made their way to the web earlier this month. The news came from KGI analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, which said there is more than a 70 percent chance that a 10.5-inch iPad Pro will be revealed at the conference. Kuo described the iPad as 'an all-new design', as it will have the same chassis size as the 9.7-inch model, but will boast a larger screen. It is believed that the device will mirror the design of Apple's upcoming iPhone 8. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Apple's iPhone 8 will be smaller than the 7 Plus but with a... Sound familiar?

Share this article Share A few weeks later, other sources shared two cases for the new iPad, but this time, a 12.9-inch device was added into the mix. One photo was posted on Twitter by tech journalist Shai Mizrachi, who also noted that the ‘Chinese factory already started to make it’. Two sources shared photos of cases for each of a 10-in (left) and 12.9-in (right) iPad Pro earlier this month, which could be unveiled along side the four new devices listed in the Russian regulatory filing  The filing has identified at least four new iPads (stock photo) with model numbers A1671, A1709, A1670 and A1701 The leaked case has suggested that it will mirror the design of Apple’s upcoming iPhone 8 with narrower bezels and a large screen on a small chassis – just as Kuo did. Another set of images, shared by Benjamin Geskin, depict wood and fabric cases for both the 10.5-in and 12.9-in iPad Pros. Gesik has also revealed that the 10.5-in model ‘won’t be bezel-less’ and will have a home button. But the Russian filings have proposed that there are four new iPads, which some have suggested will be unveiled alongside the 10.5-inch and 12.9-inch devices. The filing shows a model number A1843, which references to a next-generation Apple wireless keyboard - Apple Magic Keyboard. This device has been unchanged since 2015 (pictured) so an upgrade could be overdue  The documents also highlight a new Apple Magic Keyboard, which has not been upgraded since 2015. Although many iOS users are looking forward to seeing new iPads at the event, it is the Siri-powered speaker that has many sitting on the edge of their seats. Since April, it has been believed that Apple is set to release its own smart speaker at WWDC, which will feature ‘excellent’ sound with seven tweeters and a subwoofer. 'It will be positioned as a more premium product than the Echo … with a higher price tag to match, the site says. Although it is not clear if the rumors are true, if Apple's smart speaker does hit the market 'it would be Apple's most significant piece of new hardware' since debuting the Apple Watch in 2014'.  Sonny Dickson, who is known for sharing inside information in the tech world, recently shared on Twitter that the device will carry some form of Beats technology and is expected to run on variant iOS'. Dickson also told Mashable that it would have a 'concave top' with the controls, 'Mac Pro style.'  Read more: Eurasian filings indicate new MacBooks, iPads and Apple Magic Keyboard coming at WWDC | 9to5Mac Share or comment on this article e-mail 7 shares Most watched News videos Dramatic footage shows huge brawl at drinking spot in Newcastle Dashcam captures moment 'confused' driver causes three way smash Caravan dangerously sways and blocks dual carriageway Heart-stopping moment van driver pushes motorist into fast lane Topless man frogmarched down street at gunpoint by police in Marbella Heart-stopping moment lorry pushes car across motorway Moment Jeremy Corbyn fails to provide figures during interview 'Are you a moron?': Mum rebukes reckless driver that crashed Jeremy Corbyn refuses to say if immigration would fall with him as PM Hilarious moment mum outsmarts son's attempted prank Jeremy Kyle guest threatens him: 'I'll squash your nose' Is tatt permanent?

"> Nintendo is Fighting With Apple Over Switch Production News Reviews Features Guides Nintendo is Fighting With Apple Over Switch Production By Jasmine Henry | May 31, 2017   Nintendo is reportedly fighting with Apple over production of its new console, the Nintendo Switch. This information follows reports last week that Nintendo is aiming to increase production of the Switch in time for the holiday shopping season. Nintendo is apparently butting heads with technology juggernaut Apple over its production line. A new report suggests that because of its desire to increase production of the Nintendo Switch, it is having to compete with companies like Apple (as well as other smartphone makers) for production parts. However, this is a battle that the video game company may not be able to win. Analysts point out that “rivals for the sought-after parts can often offer better terms than Nintendo.” Those who make servers for data-centers “tend to use new and higher-margin components,” while smartphone makers issue “larger orders” than Nintendo. Either way, Nintendo comes up against technology rivals that can offer production companies much more money to make their goods than it can pay those same companies to make the Nintendo Switch. It’s unclear how or if Nintendo will still be successful in its efforts to ramp up Switch production as a result of this hurdle. While the company could potentially increase its offer and ask the production company to just make more consoles, therefore giving Nintendo a surplus, that could be risky. The Wii U missed its sales targets by a wide margin and no doubt has left Nintendo (and game retailers) with a lot of consoles collecting dust on shelves. While the Switch could potentially outsell the Wii U (as well its incredibly popular predecessor the Wii), it’s unclear whether the console can keep its momentum into next year and beyond. Creating many more consoles than it needs could be a big gamble right now. But on the other hand, what will happen if Nintendo doesn’t create many more Switch units in time for Christmas? Retailers have already suggested that Nintendo Switch stock shortages will continue all year – and presumably, those estimates have been made after even factoring in a reasonable amount of additional Switch shipments. On top of this, Nintendo already has a reputation of not being able to keep up with demand, as seen with the NES Classic and how many people were unable to get their hands on one before it was discontinued. Failing to make more Switch consoles would only further tarnish Nintendo’s rep, so how the company works to avoid that will be interesting to watch. The Nintendo Switch is available now.

Supply is tight, and Corning's "Gorilla Glass" remains a hit. But he thinks the shares are too pricey to buy despite all the positives. By Tiernan Ray May 31, 2017 10:34 a.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large Jefferies & Co.'s George Notter today reiterates a Hold rating on shares of Corning (GLW), despite hearing several positive things about the company and about the glass business during a conference last week, writing the price is too high for his taste but the trends are favorable. Notter attended the SID Display Week conference in Los Angeles, where he reports the "tone" was "quite positive" in both presentations and informal chats. On the Corning side specifically, he notes how prevalent the company's "Gorilla Glass" was at the show: Gorilla Glass 5 was very prevalent at the conference, especially with Samsung's Galaxy S8 which uses Gorilla Glass 5 on the front and back of the phone. Our conversations confirmed that GG5 commands a significant premium in the market – and that the premium is deserved for its improved drop performance. Everyone at the conference was extremely complementary of the newest Gorilla Glass iteration and it seems clear to us that Gorilla Glass will continue to fare very well with smartphones over the next few years. It is worth noting that the shift to flexible, foldable devices could be a risk for Corning's Gorilla Glass portfolio – although foldable smartphones are not expected to launch with mainstream brands until 2019. There were numerous presenters and exhibits at the conference focused on innovative protective covers for these new form factors. Of course, Corning does have a foldable offering – Willow glass – but it's not obvious at this point that Willow will be the cover glass of choice for these new products. Among the positives for the industry overall that he heard are that the industry's shift to OLED-based displays for smartphones has sucked up all the production capacity at the moment, mostly driven by Apple (AAPL) and Samsung Electronics (005930KS). (As far as television sets, they're not happening at the moment, he notes: "OLED is further away from meaningful adoption, not expected to gain traction until 2020 or 2021.") "As Apple is expected to move to OLED later this year, Samsung and Apple will consume most of the OLED capacity for the foreseeable future." That is coming at the same time capacity is being shifted to OLED, making overall capacity “tight," which is very good for all players: Overall, it's clear that supply is quite constrained right now across the industry. This is driving a healthier environment for panel makers who have exhibited positive revenue growth and generally improving margins over the last few quarters. We got some additional color on the trends that are behind this tightening supply – specifically at the panel level. Primarily, panel makers have been more aggressively evaluating their current capacity and selectively phasing out fabs. Some of these closures – most notably Samsung's L71 which accounts for ~3-4% of global production – will be repurposed for OLED mobile production. The capacity shortage for OLED small devices was a theme that came up repeatedly at the conference, especially as Apple is expected to adopt OLED later this year, soon to be followed by most other smartphone manufacturers. Of course, Samsung already uses OLED for their mobile phones and Samsung Display controls the bulk of OLED panel manufacturing. We had numerous conversations about Samsung strategically shifting their focus to OLED mobile devices in anticipation of more LCD capacity coming from China over the next few years. People are still concerned about China, specifically the country adding lots of new capacity, he writes. But his takeaway was that it may not be too big a concern right now because of all those capacity shortages. Despite all the positives, Corning's valuation is too rich for Notter, with the risk and reward for the company now "balanced" in his view: "The current forward PE multiple (15.5x) also tempers our enthusiasm for the shares to some degree. " "the shares are trading well above their long-term average forward PE. Our Price Target remains $27.50, or 14.5x our 2018 EPS projection – still a modest discount to the peer group – appropriate given Corning's relative earnings quality." Corning stock today is down 16 cents, or half a percent, at at $29.16.

North Korea launches its own tablet called the iPad North Korean tech firm Ryonghung is advertising new tablet called the 'iPad' Apple’s trademark guidelines prohibit any unauthorized use of its content The Ryonghung iPad is equipped with 1 gigabyte of RAM and just 8GB storage By Cheyenne Macdonald For Dailymail.com Published: 12:03 EDT, 31 May 2017 | Updated: 12:29 EDT, 31 May 2017 e-mail 26 shares 53 View comments North Korean tech firm Ryonghung has begun to advertise a new tablet, and its name may sound oddly familiar – ‘iPad.’ While the new Ryonghung iPad doesn’t boast the same specs as Apple’s product, its name appears to be a clear violation of the company’s trademark. It’s not the first time North Korea has unveiled a product that appears to mimic Apple, as it’s unlikely the firm will take action, according to Apple Insider. North Korean tech firm Ryonghung has begun to advertise a new tablet, and its name may sound oddly familiar – ‘iPad.’ While the new Ryonghung iPad doesn’t boast the same specs as Apple’s product, its name appears to be a clear violation of the company’s trademark APPLE'S TRADEMARK  According to Apple’s trademark and copyright guidelines, the use of the firm’s trademarked content for company, product, and service name is prohibited unless authorized. ‘You may not use or register, in whole or in part, Apple, iPod, iTunes, Macintosh, iMac, or any other Apple trademark,’ the guidelines state, ‘including Apple-owned graphic symbols, logos, icons, or an alteration thereof, as or as part of a company name, trade name, product name, or service name except as specifically noted in these guidelines.’ While North Korean tech companies have ripped off Apple’s ideas in the past, even once unveiling a computer that looked nearly identical to an iMac, this is the first time an internationally famous trademark has been blatantly been lifted, according to NK News. The Ryonghung iPad was popular at a national science and technology festival and product shows in North Korea in 2016, the advertisement claims. But in terms of the specs, it’s far from matching Apple’s flagship tablet. It’s equipped with 1 gigabyte of RAM and just 8GB of storage, and runs on a 1.2-gigahertz quad-core processor. The memory is loaded with ‘dictionary and other apps,’ and has network connection capabilities, according to the ad. ‘It can perform a range of functions such as reading different sources of digital information, office work, and documentation,’ according to the advertisement.

And, there have even been reports that Kim Jong Un uses an actual Apple iMac, according to Gizmodo. It’s unclear how much the Ryonghung iPad is being sold for, but the ad claims it is ‘now popular among customers.’ Read more: Legal - Copyright and Trademark Guidelines - Apple North Korean company launches own 'iPad,' ignoring Apple trademarks North Korean company advertising domestically-made “iPad” | NK News - North Korea News deadspin-quote-carrot-aligned-w-bgr-2 Share or comment on this article e-mail 26 shares Most watched News videos Cheeky monkey pulls on woman's shirt as she tries to take picture Cops SLAM teen into sand after massive brawl on New Jersey beach New video shows US intercepting fake nuke in flight test Giant octopus makes desperate bid to escape aquarium Adorable moment orphaned baby kangaroo learns to stand Pentagon successfully shoots down a mock nuclear warhead Hilarious moment mum outsmarts son's attempted prank Alligator goes into a death roll as it's removed from pool Flight attendant shows you the least glamorous part of her job Dash cam of woman hitting a biker before her car crashes BA boss denies IT glitch was due to outsourcing jobs abroad Heart-stopping moment van driver pushes motorist into fast lane South Korean president is 'shocked' his advisers did not...

MailOnline puts Sony's XB40 to the test Sony SRS-XB40 has a built-in multi-coloured line light, speaker lights and a flashing strobe. It features 24 hours of battery life and claims to be a 'mini-disco on the move'. But does it live up to the claim? Samsung's Galaxy S8: A hefty price tag and a dumb personal assistant Samsung's new Galaxy S8 phone is stunning, but its $100 price hike is hard to swallow. Overall the S8 is for those who want elegance - and are willing to pay for it. Affordable, robust and surprisingly responsive: Samsung's Galaxy A5 With the eagerly awaited Galaxy S8 having been pushed back, South Korea-based Samsung has plugged the gap with the Samsung Galaxy A5, a high-end device with a mid-range price tag. Is it really worth paying £280 for Nintendo's Switch? MailOnline's verdict While the design is impressive and easy to use, the game line up is disappointing. Google's Daydream: The $79 headset that could bring VR to the masses Google's $79 headset is superb in terms of hardware - but is currently let down by a lack of apps. However, it has absolutely huge potential to finally bring VR to the masses. Welcome Home: Google's $130 smart speaker Google's smart Home speaker still has a lot of learning to do, and loses out to Amazon's Echo in some areas - but has incredible potential 'Not quite an iPhone replacement': Google's Pixel phone Google's Pixel handset is good, and boasts an amazing camera and smart assistant. It's the king of the Android handsets - but still not great. Xbox One S review: Console that will make your 4K TV shine Microsoft's Xbox One S has shrunk the giant console by 40%, and is stunningly designed console with 4K HDR capabilities - but comes with some caveats. The $1,000 wireless speaker that really IS worth the price: Naim Mu-so Qb review Naim's incredible Mu-So Qb takes you back to the good old days - where the music captivates and enthralls, rather that simply being something in the background. The hi-tech $2,000 spin bike that really could change your life Peloton's hi-tech bike lets you stream live and on demand rides to your home - and it's one of the best examples of fitness technology out there - at a price. Apple's new 9.7inch iPad Pro is a powerhouse you can take anywhere Apple has added a few improvements to the smaller version, creating a tablet that is astonishingly powerful, but, unlike its big brother, is something you'll be able to carry everywhere. Speaker that looks as good as its sounds: B&W Zeppelin Wireless review It's not cheap, but the $699 (£500) Zeppelin Wireless is perfect for the design conscious music fan. The best all in one wireless speaker you'll ever hear: Naim Mu-so review It might not be a name familiar to the US market, but Naim is a legendary British brand hoping to make a splash with the American launch of its $1499 Mu:So speaker.

AP 28/29 'Pink Star' diamond sells for world record £57m in Hong Kong auction - Tuesday April 4 A rare pink diamond dubbed the “Pink Star” has become the world's most expensive gemstone to sell at auction, coming under the hammer in Hong Kong on Tuesday for $71.2m (£57.3m). The oval-cut 59.6 carat jewel, discovered in a mine in Africa by De Beers in 1999, is the largest fancy vivid pink diamond, categorised as “flawless” or “internally flawless”, that the Gemological Institute of America (GIA) has ever graded. It sold after a five-minute bidding war, that started at $56m, to Hong Kong jewellery retailer Chow Tai Fook at Sotheby's. AP 29/29 Stopping climate change could boost the world economy by £15 trillion - Tuesday March 21 Efforts to slow climate change won’t just keep the planet habitable. They will also boost the world economy by $19 trillion (£15.2 trillion). Investments in renewable power and energy efficiency will add about 0.8 per cent to global gross domestic product by 2050, the International Renewable Energy Agency, or Irena, said Monday in a report produced for the German government. Governments are committing resources to green energy in a bid to keep warming within 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit), of pre-industrial conditions, in accordance with the landmark Paris Agreement on global warming. Getty Smoking kills more than 7 million people a year, including around 890,000 non-smokers exposed to second-hand fumes, according to the WHO. A survey published by the European Commission to coincide with WNTD found that there has been no decrease in the number of regular smokers in the EU since 2014. Amongst 15 to 24-year-olds the number of daily smokers has gone up in that time. ”The increase in youth smoking rates illustrates the urgency for member states to enforce the provisions of the Tobacco Products Directive, which forbid attractive cigarettes aimed at enticing young people,“ said Vytenis Andriukaitis, EU commissioner for health and food safety.

It Doesn't Know Enough About You By Kevin Maney On 5/30/17 at 12:25 PM Close Tech & Science Apple big data Alphabet Amazon Facebook Microsoft Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook are the five most valuable U.S. companies, in that order. By 2025, it’s a good bet at least one will no longer be on that list. Which company will that be? Maybe the one starting to move into a $5 billion headquarters building that looks like a cross between a starship and a Bundt cake? It’s simplistic but fun to base Apple’s prospects entirely on the Edifice complex, which dictates that a company’s future success is inversely correlated to the grandiosity of its home office. A few years ago, super-investor Marc Andreessen published a list of 10 signs a company is ripe for a fall. No. 7: “Pouring huge money into overly glorious new headquarters.” This principle is why no Sears employees are still in what used to be Chicago’s Sears Tower. Subscribe to Newsweek from $1 per week But there is a more profound reason to believe Apple could be culled from the Big Five: data. Data, as pundits like to say, is the new oil. Companies with the most data will win. Sucking Up Data Data make a company’s machine-learning software get smarter so that the company can better serve customers and vacuum up more market share. Think of Amazon’s recommendation engine or the way the Google search algorithm constantly hones itself. As a company wins share, it pulls in yet more data, and the machine-learning software keeps getting smarter, further distancing the winning company from the also-rans. That spiral is why we’ve wound up with a handful of tech giants that boast a combined market value greater than the gross domestic product of the United Kingdom. Related: How AI will cure America's sick health care system The top five companies might appear to be in different businesses—hardware, search, software, retail, social media—but in fact they are competing fiercely against one another for one thing: data. Whenever you use any of their products or services, you are giving them data and making them smarter. So a primary factor in the future success of these companies is whether they can soak up more and new kinds of data about you and the world at large. An aerial view of the new Apple headquarters on April 28, 2017 in Cupertino, California. Apple's new 175-acre campus dubbed "Apple Park" was designed by Lord Norman Foster and cost roughly $5 billion. Justin Sullivan/Getty Alphabet, the second-most valuable company after Apple, operates a mind-boggling web of data-collecting services. It starts with Google’s 90 percent share of search, which acts like the company’s real-time ticker showing what the planet’s population is interested in right now. (In May, Google Trends showed a sudden spike in searches for “Richard Nixon.” Wonder why.) Add to that Google’s Chrome browser, Gmail, Google Docs, YouTube, maps, calendars, photos and Android, which runs 80 percent of the world’s smartphones and tracks a ton of data about each user. Alphabet is to data collection what a humpback whale is to krill. Facebook knows a side of you that Google doesn’t—your social interactions and, thus, a lot about your personality. It has about 2 billion active users globally, and that’s not counting WhatsApp, Instagram and whatever the company will do with Oculus virtual reality. Facebook is also becoming the world’s most powerful news service, so its software can learn about events and public sentiment from billions of clicks, likes and shares. Amazon sucks up more data than any other company about consumer habits, while Amazon Web Services (AWS)—the cloud-computing juggernaut—gives Amazon a window on how data are being used by thousands of startups and big companies such as Netflix, which host their operations on AWS. Now Amazon is betting its Alexa gadgets can become our ever-present personal assistants in the cloud, gathering data about our lives along the way. And Microsoft? Yeah, it’s more boring than the others, but it’s entrenched in the world’s business operations with Windows, Office, server software and cloud computing. Corporations would grind to a halt without PowerPoint. Much of that software gives Microsoft ways to soak up more data about how we work than any competitor except maybe Google. Can Apple Catch Up? That brings us back to Apple. Yes, we love its hardware, and we will keep buying iPhones and MacBooks and iPads—though even Apple’s hardware prowess is getting a little humdrum. The introduction of a new iPhone model used to generate goosebumps. Now the anticipation for the iPhone 8, to be unveiled in the fall, feels about on the level of excitement for a new model Chevy Camaro. More important, Apple seems to be in a data-collection corner when competing against the other four giants. Its crown jewel—the iPhone and iOS—accounts for just 20 percent of smartphones, which means Google gets the data from the other 80 percent of smartphone users. Apple has no search, no social network, no significant online retail operation, no cloud services. All its productivity software ranks behind similar products from Microsoft and Google. Apple’s Siri, once the star of commercials with John Malkovich, has fallen behind Alexa and Google’s voice services in the race to be our digital assistants. Related: Will AI robots turn humans into pets? Meanwhile, Facebook, Google and Microsoft are investing heavily in virtual reality and seem to be well ahead of Apple. Even iTunes, which once funneled vast amounts of data about media habits to Apple, has turned into a technological laggard behind the likes of Netflix, Spotify, Amazon streaming services and Google’s YouTube. In just about every avenue for collecting data, Apple has been beaten. And because, in the era of machine learning, data relentlessly increases the gap between the winners and losers, it’s hard to see how Apple can catch up to Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft and Facebook. Selling cool hardware that we all need will be a good business for a long time, just as selling cars or refrigerators can be a good business. But when it comes to inventing the data-driven, machine-learning future, four of the big five seem to be in a better position, while one is moving 12,000 employees into a steel-and-glass wheel that sports a 100,000-square-foot fitness center with a two-story yoga room that, as Wired reports, is “covered in stone, from just the right quarry in Kansas, that’s been carefully distressed, like a pair of jeans, to make it look like the stone at [Steve] Jobs’s favorite hotel in Yosemite.” Not every high-flying company tanks after building luxury digs, but it’s happened enough that people notice. Silicon Graphics built a huge campus at its peak, then abandoned it to a rising Google in 2003. MySpace signed a 12-year lease worth $350 million in Los Angeles in 2008, as Facebook loomed on its horizon. AOL Time Warner started building a massive home in the middle of New York in 2000, just before the stock collapsed and the merger got labeled one of the worst deals ever. Apple is packed with brilliant people who may surprise us with some wondrous new thing that leaves other companies far behind. It also has nearly $260 billion in cash—enough to buy General Electric, AT&T or Anheuser-Busch InBev. (Apple Beer!) But it’s just as likely that the new Apple campus will eventually seem like a monument to a great run that culminated in an $800 million market cap the moment the moving vans pulled up out front.

All the rumours you need to read about the iPhone 8 May, 31 2017 Author: Thema Newsroom It’s not gonna have WHICH iconic Apple feature? Related Which companies accept bitcoin? (list) 5 cool gadgets that will make your life easier (video) With teddy bear Bluetooth hack, 11-year-old proves IoT security is… Smartphone addiction (infographic) 8 Android tricks & tips that most users don’t know… Seeing as we’ve cracked, smashed, lost and dropped more Apple products than we can even bear to think about, you’d think we’d be put off using their phones. Right? Er, wrong – which is why we’re so interested in the iPhone 8 release and all the rumours surrounding the follow up phone to the iPhone 7s. So what can be expected from the next iPhone in the series? What will the iPhone 8 look like? Numerous publications have been referencing ‘Apple expert’ (what that exactly means, we’re not sure) Benjamin Geskin’s tweets which show a leaked idea of what the iPhone 8 will look like. As you can see, these images suggest there’ll be no Home button on the new phone (?!), and the Touch ID fingerprint scanner will be embedded within the display. Whaaaat. The handset will also reportedly have a new OLED display that will stretch across the whole front of the phone. How big will the iPhone 8 be? Rumours say the iPhone 8 will be the biggest one yet at 5.8inches – with the iPhone the iPhone 7 Plus coming in at 5.5-inches. So yeah, it’ll be pretty huge. What new functions will the iPhone 8 have? Apparently, Apple are hoping to introduce 3D scanning that will be able to see people’s faces, a “function area” at the bottom of the large screen allowing easy access to certain features – much like the new Macbook Pro’s touch bar, and extra display places for things like photos, The Independent reports. It’s thought it’ll also have a storage update (yaaas), as well as the ability to float on water, according to Tech Stuff. They say Apple previously filed a patent to create a phone with shock absorbers – and a mechanism which means the phone floats – in a bid to prevent cracked screens and water damage. A report in Bloomberg also suggested the iPhone 8 will have wireless charging abilities. How good will the selfies be? After the revolutionary introduction of the dual camera and portrait mode on the iPhone 7 Plus, are all our selfies going to get better and better from now on? 9to5Mac think it’ll remain exclusive to the bigger of the iPhone models in the future – which is great news for iPhone 8 users. There’s also talk of a “revolutionary” new selfie camera that uses infrared technology to detect the location and depth of objects in its field of vision, and a 3D camera system for 3D selfies, face and iris recognition. Instagram game, strong. When will the iPhone 8 be released? Apple traditionally release the latest iPhones during the first two weeks of September, so following that pattern would mean between 4 – 17 September 2017. But with that said, this year marks 10 years since the original iPhone first came out – with Tech Trader Daily questioning whether that means it’ll come out on the same date 29 June, or sooner that the usual September. How much will the iPhone 8 cost? According to the Fast Company, who say “a source with knowledge of Apple’s plans” leaked the price plan to them, report that the iPhone 8 will be the most expensive yet, exceeding the $1,000 (£778) mark for the first time.

The studio will be in the McEnery Convention Center Tuesday through Friday and podcasters can reserve time slots each day. Apple hosting a podcast recording studio at WWDC Podcast Studio reservations are free and time slots are good for up to 60 minutes. Apple is opening up reservations through the WWDC app at 7AM each day, so don’t procrastinate each morning or you won’t get a slot. Apple’s Podcast Studio description in the WWDC app states, Reserve time in our fully outfitted studio to record the latest episode of your audio podcast, right here at WWDC. Each 60 minute session can accommodate up to four contributors, with Apple experts on hand to help get your session up and running.

WWDC is Apple’s annual event where macOS, iOS, watchOS, and tvOS developers gather to see what’s coming in the next major software release and to learn more about coding for the company’s platforms.

US Consumer Satisfaction Among Leading Flagship Devices News provided by Strategy Analytics 31 May, 2017, 10:18 ET Share this article BOSTON, May 31, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- A new report from the Consumer Sentiment Analysis (CSA) service at Strategy Analytics "Monthly Ratings Report April 2017: US Flagship Smartphones", analyzing consumer reviews from major distribution channels in the US, has found that specific features such as battery, camera and display have become integral drivers in the satisfaction or dissatisfaction of new smartphone purchases. Click here for the report: https://www.strategyanalytics.com/access-services/ux-innovation/consumer-sentiment-analytics/reports/report-detail/monthly-ratings-report-april-2017-us-flagship-smartphones#.WS0r0esrKM8 Key report findings include: The camera was the most mentioned device feature for nearly all flagship smartphones included in this study. The camera of the Samsung Galaxy S7 was mentioned positively by 1 in 5 reviews, compared to 1 in 6 reviews of the Apple iPhone 7. Almost 1 in 5 reviews commented positively on the battery of Samsung Galaxy S7 compared to only 1 in 10 Apple iPhone 7 reviews. In comparison, while nearly 1 in 5 reviews commented positively on the battery life of the Motorola Moto Z Droid, 1 in 10 commented negatively, the most of any flagship smartphone included in this study. "High market share indicates the popularity of a brand, but it is important to note that it does not directly equate to consumer sentiment for that brand. This is especially true when investigating the correlation between sentiment and market share at the model level. The ranking of top smartphones based on consumer sentiment analysis and market share of flagship devices is quite different," commented Adam Thorwart, Lead Analyst and report author. Kevin Nolan, VP, UXIP added "This is particularly interesting when comparing the success of Samsung's Galaxy S7 to Apple's iPhone 7. Samsung Galaxy S7 consumers were more critical of battery performance than any other feature reviewed which could feed into Samsung's on-going battery challenges, not least because of the additional features which come with a S8 without incremental battery power increases. It will be very interesting to see how this is viewed because battery performance is always a critical topic."

Amazon’s Alexa app can now link Apple iCloud Calendars to enable Echo integration. Sony A6500 iCloud Calendar support for the Amazon Echo ecoystem means users can activate the Alexa voice assistant to ask about upcoming calendar events or add calendar entries hands-free. iCloud Calendar support will sync from the server to other iCloud-connected devices, too, so appointments will show up just like a Siri-added entry. Amazon says iCloud Calendar support is live now in three regions: the US, UK, and Germany. Alexa also works with G suite accounts, Google/Gmail accounts, Office 365 commercial customers with Exchange Online mailboxes, and Outlook.com email accounts (including all Outlook.com, Hotmail, Live, or MSN email accounts). As for Apple’s offering, the company is rumored to be planning to introduce its own AI home product on Monday at the opening WWDC keynote. Unique features could include HomeKit and Apple Music integration among other first-party services and technology support. Amazon’s Alexa app is available for free on the App Store. Earlier this month, Amazon announced its first Echo with a display called Echo Show which will ship at the end of next month for $229. Check out 9to5Mac on YouTube for more Apple news!

After a long, quiet spring, what will Apple announce? What innovations have they been working on? By David Gewirtz for DIY-IT | May 31, 2017 -- 14:20 GMT (07:20 PDT) | Topic: Innovation Apple is preparing for the 2017 WWDC. Apple's 2017 World Wide Developer's Conference will begin next Monday at the McEnery Convention Center in San Jose, California. Contrary to early expectations, this event is not being held at the not quite ready for prime time Apple Park. And, speaking of expectations, in this article, we're going to look at what prognosticators, predictors, and pundits think might be discussed at next week's event. Countdown to WWDC 2017 Apple confirms opening keynote on June 5 Apple needs to learn to love Android and Windows How to check if your favorite iOS apps will soon be obsolete With one small tweak, the iPad could replace the laptop Report: Apple to discontinue iPad Mini Forget Microsoft and Google, Apple's next tech arch-enemy is Amazon Not your father's MacBook: The pros and cons of Apple's tiny ultrabook WWDC is supposed to be all about developers and coding, but in recent years Apple has used it as an excuse for another announcement. In 2015, Apple announced Apple Music. In 2013, Apple announced its ill-fated trash can Mac Pro (with Phil Schiller uttering the immortal line, "can't innovate anymore, my ass."). This year, given that the company eschewed a spring launch event, it's a pretty fair guess that there will be some beyond-coding announcements in the June 5 keynote speech. Here's what we expect. Almost guaranteed Being a prognosticator is like being a TV weather announcer. It comes with some degree of guaranteed error. But even with the fact that we don't know all that much, here are the "sure bets" for what we expect to be discussed at WWDC. #1) Next MacOS update news: Apple has been updating its desktop OS, MacOS, like clockwork each year. This year will probably be no different. Of interest, though, is whether Apple will introduce any truly new or innovative capabilities, or continue its long march towards unification or parity with iOS. In past years, Apple has named its MacOS (originally OS X) versions after animals, failed presidential candidates (Mavericks -- yes, I'm kidding), and California landmarks. This year, expect another famous California name, Big Sur, perhaps. #2) iOS update: At Apple's spiritual core these days is iOS. It's time for Apple to unveil iOS 11. This is particularly interesting, because the features in the iOS update often provide indicators of what to expect from new iDevices announced the following autumn. With a big, new Anniversary Edition phone anticipated in September or October, expect developers to show rapt interest in this part of the event. #3) watchOS: The Apple Watch has continued to evolve, with fitness and health a major focus. Expect to see further discussion of fitness capabilities (plus some bragging). #4) tvOS: Ever since Apple announced the new generation of Apple TV that runs apps, app development and production has been growing for this "hobby" set top box. A broadcast-replacement play from Apple has been long rumored. Since Hulu and other companies are beginning to syndicate traditional networks, this may be an arena Apple will enter. There is also some expectation that Amazon's Prime Video will finally make it to the Apple TV this year, if the two companies can learn to work and play together. #5) News about Apple Park and sustainability: Apple is making great progress on its new headquarters. Since the company has long bragged about its environmental awareness, we're pretty sure there will be a WWDC keynote segment devoted to these two topics. Fair chance Apple hasn't been as secretive as it would like (mostly due to leaks from vendors and developer partners), so we have some expectation that we'll see mention of the following. #6) Updated MacBook Pros: Hot on the heels of what were apparently hot selling but universally panned MacBook Pros in October, the rumor mills say there might be new processors announced. Given the generally low performance and mind-boggling price of the October MacBook Pros, expect some very cranky noise from recent purchasers if that happens. #7) Updated MacBook: The Retina 12-inch MacBook Pro hasn't gotten a refresh since April of 2016, so it's a fair bet this baby will see a rev. #8) More details on Mac Pro: Ever since Apple admitted its failing with the trash can Mac Pro just a few months ago, we've been expecting more news. Is it too soon to expect more news? Perhaps not. #9) Other Macs: Filling out the Mac line, no news has definitely not been good news when it comes to the Mac mini and Retina iMac, both last updated more than two years ago. Will there be any news? The rumor mills have been silent here. #10) New iPads: Where the rumor mills have definitely not been silent is the expectation that there may be a ten inch iPad. This was first expected in April, but that didn't happen. The fate of the 12-inch iPad Pro is also an item of curiosity. This device is running on almost two years and hasn't even seen its first update. Long shots and moon shots While all rumors are rumors, there are some longer shots that have an even lower probability of ever reaching reality. This is where we start reading tea leaves. Here are a few to look for. More robotics Watch this 3D-printed robot walk on sand This is the first soft robot that can walk on rough surfaces. Read More #11) Will Apple discuss AR or VR? Augmented reality and virtual reality have been amusements for most tech companies. But since Tim Cook recently indicated an interest in AR, it's possible we'll see some of that fleshed out, at least at the developer level. #12) Will Apple go deeper into AI? Apple was one of the first big tech companies to make a public bet on AI with Siri, but recently the company seems to have slipped behind its competitors, most notably the Alexa series from Amazon. Will Apple finally add more developer access to Siri? What about other AI technologies? We'll see. #13) What about Siri in a can? With Google Home and the Alexa devices, Apple is behind the cloud-in-a-can trend. There are rumblings about a Siri speaker, so we'll see if Apple delivers. Integrating Siri further into the Apple TV, and adding microphone and speaker capabilities, would be another obvious choice. #14) What about CarPlay? Although Apple released 10.2.1 a few months ago, the company hasn't mentioned its vehicular version of iOS for over a year. Perhaps it's time. #15) Will there be a flying car? Speaking of cars, as far as we can tell, any Apple iCar is far into the future, if ever. But if there's going to be an Apple Car, why not give it four props this year, and send it up into the air? That's right. We're talking about the Apple iDrone, People Carrier Edition. All right, fine. We totally made that up. To find out what's really going to happen, you'll just have to tune into WWDC next week. See you there!

Nintendo is experiencing Switch shortages due to low supply of critical components, like memory chips that store data and liquid-crystal displays, which Apple is gobbling up for its own products, The Wall Street Journal is reporting, citing sources who claim to have knowledge of the problem. Those sources told the Journal that strong consumer demand for Apple's existing iPhone 7 line of devices, as well as work on upcoming handsets from the technology giant, leave little supply for other companies, like Nintendo. The Nintendo Switch has proven to be one of the year's biggest hits. The console allows users to play games on their televisions, but can also be detached from a dock for mobile play. The device is currently unavailable at major retailers, and whenever new stock is made available, it quickly sells out. Nintendo has said that it's working as hard as it can to get new supply to customers, but it's been slow going. Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter Nintendo (ntdoy) hasn't commented on why supply isn't ramping up to the degree some might like, and has instead touted the strong demand for its hardware. However, the Journal's sources suggest that Apple, which makes some of the world's most popular products, has far more power in the supply chain, thanks to the massive number of units it orders from suppliers. Apple's (aapl) orders, therefore, are being fulfilled before others, leaving Nintendo to wait in line. The Journal's sources said that Nintendo could respond by spending more on parts, but the move could push its console pricing to more than its current $299 price—something the company is apparently unwilling to do. Still, there are no signs of when Nintendo might overcome its Switch's supply troubles. The company has said that demand will likely will remain strong through the end of the year. Meanwhile, Apple might not present many opportunities for Nintendo to jump the line. The iPhone maker is rumored to be planning three new handsets this year, and many analysts have said that 2017 could represent a "super-cycle" for Apple due to exceedingly high demand for its next handsets.

The app’s creators – ex-Apple designer Sebastiaan de With and ex-Twitter engineer Ben Sandofsky – aim to best Apple’s own app with a focus on advanced users, whereas the inbuilt Camera app acts as more of a ‘point and shoot’ option. While Apple’s recent how-to guides give some way to improve the photography of the average user, Halide goes beyond the possibilities of Apple’s own app by offering professional tools such as focus peaking, a detailed histogram, adaptive level grid, and RAW support. Halide begins in a ‘smart automatic’ mode, but with a tap can be switched to full manual mode, giving the user control over ISO, shutter speed, white balance, and focus. The duo put huge effort in to the design of the application, even commissioning a custom typeface for the user interface, developed by Jelmar Geertsma and called Halide Router. The app uses both visual and haptic feedback, giving it a tactile quality that is unmatched in the many other camera apps available in 2017. Speaking about the work put in to the app’s design, Sebastiaan explained: Nothing matched the pleasure of using a well-built camera. Halide aims to fix that. The app is available at the time of writing for a discounted price of $2.99, rising to $4.99 in a week’s time. It can be found in Apple’s App Store – no Android release for the moment, unfortunately.

Rumors of a new 10.5” iPad Pro have been swirling for months and have been backed up more recently by alleged renderings of the device and images of cases, but even if Apple has a cellular and WiFi model of that device coming, that still leaves two more mystery iPads to come. It’s been a few years since Apple debuted hardware during WWDC and even longer since it debuted an iOS device at the event—revealing the iPhone 4 there in 2010—but respected KGI analyst Ming-Chi Kuo claims there’s an “over 70 percent” chance that Apple will debut the 10.5” iPad Pro at the event. If Apple is going to release new hardware its software event, we can’t help but wonder if they’re ramping up in anticipation of some new significant iPad-related features in iOS 11. What new hardware could actually be in store is still an open question. Despite all the talk that the company could be killing off the iPad mini in the near future due to its competition with the iPhone 7 Plus, last year Kuo also predicted that Apple would release a 7.9” iPad Pro in 2017, although he made no mention of a smaller iPad Pro in his more recent proclamations. It’s also possible that Apple has kept a refresh of the larger 12.9” iPad Pro under wraps, but only time will tell. The filings also note the addition of a new Magic Keyboard—which hasn’t been updated since 2015—but this is the first we’ve heard of it.

Click here for the report: https://www.strategyanalytics.com/access-services/ux-innovation/consumer-sentiment-analytics/reports/report-detail/monthly-ratings-report-april-2017-us-flagship-smartphones#.WS0r0esrKM8 Key report findings include: The camera was the most mentioned device feature for nearly all flagship smartphones included in this study. The camera of the Samsung Galaxy S7 was mentioned positively by 1 in 5 reviews, compared to 1 in 6 reviews of the Apple iPhone 7. Almost 1 in 5 reviews commented positively on the battery of Samsung Galaxy S7 compared to only 1 in 10 Apple iPhone 7 reviews. In comparison, while nearly 1 in 5 reviews commented positively on the battery life of the Motorola Moto Z Droid, 1 in 10 commented negatively, the most of any flagship smartphone included in this study. "High market share indicates the popularity of a brand, but it is important to note that it does not directly equate to consumer sentiment for that brand. This is especially true when investigating the correlation between sentiment and market share at the model level. The ranking of top smartphones based on consumer sentiment analysis and market share of flagship devices is quite different," commented Adam Thorwart, Lead Analyst and report author. Kevin Nolan, VP, UXIP added "This is particularly interesting when comparing the success of Samsung's Galaxy S7 to Apple's iPhone 7. Samsung Galaxy S7 consumers were more critical of battery performance than any other feature reviewed which could feed into Samsung's on-going battery challenges, not least because of the additional features which come with a S8 without incremental battery power increases. It will be very interesting to see how this is viewed because battery performance is always a critical topic."

ADVERTISEMENT From creator and executive producer James Corden and Ben Winston, "Carpool Karaoke: The Series" based on the popular "Late Late Show" segment of the same name, will consist of 16 half-hour episodes that bring together a celebrity and a musician to sing songs while driving in a car. A different group of pairings will appear each week on Tuesday including Will Smith and Corden, Miley Cyrus and her family, Shakira and Trevor Noah, "Game of Thrones" stars Sophie Turner and Maisie Williams, Queen Latifah and Jada Pinkett Smith, John Legend, Alicia Keys and Taraji P. Henson and LeBron James and Corden, just to name a few. Blake Shelton, John Cena, Chelsea Handler, Metallica, Shaquille O' Neal, Michael Strahan, Jeff Gordon, Billy Eichner and Seth MacFarlane are also set to star on the show. "The new Carpool Karaoke series features 16 celebrity pairings riding along in a car together as they sing tunes from their personal playlists and surprise fans who don't expect to see big stars belting out tunes one lane over," reads the synopsis. "I'm still going to see my kid on the weekends," Corden said previously of not having to host the series for every episode as he does on his late night show. "This just became a wonderful platform to see these people in such an intimate environment. I don't feel it's mine." Corden will still continue to produce Carpool Karaoke segments as part of "The Late Late Show." << PRIOR STORY Jennifer Lopez, Alex Rodriguez celebrate 'World of Dance' premiere NEXT STORY >> Vanessa Hudgens joins 'So You Think You Can Dance' as judge Get more Reality TV World!

Apple announced the release of the new 2018 Mac Pro with high processing performance, easier ways to upgrade and more changes to the construction of the system. Phil Schiller, marketing chief at Apple said in an interview that the company is rethinking the Mac Pro, which means it will be a lot different than the 2013 version. Apple doesn’t want people to get annoyed by the fact that 2018 isn’t exactly on the corner. So to prevent people from getting inpatient, they upgraded the 2013 model. Specifications will be announced later in 2017, providing a lot more processing power than ever, while keeping the already known slim design. Looks As the interview claimed, this device will have a modular design, meaning the users can change components whenever they please. The reason for the design changes is the thermal issue that appeared on the 2013 Mac Pro. Display Along with other new features, the Apple company revealed that they are working on a new Pro Display special for the computer including high resolution and USB C port. Hardware It said that the new 2018 Mac Pro will have strong internal components just like its rumors. It’s possible that Apple will continue using an Intel processor, but not the Xeon CPus present in current models. Considering the presence of the Xeon E3-1285 processor in the Pro iMac that will be launched in the second half of 2017, the 2018 Mac Pro is likely to have more power. When will it be coming out? Apple has confirmed that the new Mac Pro will be released in 2018. Phil Schiller stated that the whole internal development team is doing their best to create a better Mac Pro and that the good thing is even if it’s not what they expected, they learned not to be afraid to admit it and to always search for better solutions.

Apple has allowed the 15 inch MacBook Pro to be ordered on its online store for free delivery between June 6 and June 8 only in the United States. Apple claims that the new MacBook Pro and 12 inch MacBook models will be also released soon enough, on the 5th day of June. The notebooks are only getting internal improvements, along with an update to a faster Intel processor under the name of Kaby Lake. The 13 inch MacBook Pro versions are still in the stock market and available for a fast delivery in the United States and other countries as well. The confusing part is the Apple’s plans that includes the release of the 15 inch MacBook Pro next week. We don’t know for sure if only this new device will be available for purchase from the store or if the 13 inch MacBook Pro models are just being generous. The Kaby Lake processor is quickly available for the 13 inch MacBook Pro. In the past, Apple has spread out the release of the MacBook Pro, launching a 13 inch model in March 2015, while in the following year the 15 inch model has came out in May. In 2012, however, the Apple company claimed at WWDC that they decided to launch the 15 inch MacBook Pro device including Retina display in June and the 13 inch model in October within the same year. Delivery information The estimated delivery for the 15 inch MacBook Pro will take as long as it would take in the United Kingdom, Netherlands, Australia, Germany, Italy, Canada, France, Spain, Singapore, Hong Kong and more other countries eligible for the delivery. In October 2016, Apple refreshed the MacBook Pro and before that, the notebook went almost 2 years without receiving updates. There’s only a 220 days difference between the old and the new MacBook Pro model.

The WWDC 2017 schedule is here and it features an interesting new addition this year: Apple is offering up the Apple Podcasts Studio for podcasters to record their shows on site! The event is listed as a Lab in the WWDC app and includes a link to a page where podcasters can request a reservation for a 60-minute session. Reserve time in our fully outfitted studio to record the latest episode of your audio podcast, right here at WWDC. Each 60 minute session can accommodate up to four contributors, with Apple experts on hand to help get your session up and running. You will receive a copy of your session for post-production and distribution. If you'd resolved to recording your show in less-than-ideal conditions (hotel rooms, noisy hallways, or, God forbid, outdoors), you might try to get a reservation for Apple's "fully outfitted" studio instead! You'll have to have quick fingers if you want to secure your spot, though. Apple won't let you request a reservation until the day of the Lab, beginning at 7 a.m. on that day. It's nice to see Apple give a nod — if slight — to the podcasting community. Much of the discussion surrounding Apple and its products takes place on tech podcasts and many people look to podcasts for not only commentary, but information about Apple. Here's to hoping this is only the beginning of Apple's appreciation for the podcasting community.

Saving & Budgeting Getting Out of Debt Create an Emergency Fund Which Accounts Should I Use? College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: The Latest Sign That Apple, Inc. Wants to Make Its Own Baseband Modems The Mac maker makes a big hire, underscoring its cellular ambitions. Evan Niu, CFA (TMFNewCow) May 31, 2017 at 9:00AM For those paying attention, the evidence that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) intends on developing its own baseband modems has been mounting for years. As far as Apple has come over the years with its semiconductor design capabilities, the most prominent missing feature has been integrated cellular connectivity. It appears the tech titan has made another move toward achieving that goal. Image source: Apple. Switching teams Fortune reports that Apple has now hired Esin Terzioglu away from Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), where he was a vice president of engineering for Qualcomm's chip segment for nearly eight years. Terzioglu's specialties include wireless connectivity and low-power designs, among others. Poaching Terzioglu from Qualcomm appears to be a solid win for Apple, and hints that the Mac maker is indeed looking to bring modem development in house -- all at a time when the two companies are embroiled in an epic legal battle that continues to escalate. Most recently, Qualcomm sued Apple's suppliers and is seeking an import injunction because they have breached their licensing agreements, as Apple is withholding royalty payments via these suppliers. Raymond James analyst Tavis McCourt has issued a research note (via Tech Trader Daily) on the development, believing that the news is the "latest in a list of instances suggesting that Apple has plans to develop full SoCs [system-on-chip] in house for future mobile devices" and that the hire "seems to suggest that Apple is acquiring the necessary expertise to develop such technology." A cellular-capable A-series chip seems inevitable Apple's chip ambitions appear to have no bounds. Not only are there now four distinct chips that Apple designs for different purposes, it recently notified graphics architecture supplier Imagination Technologies that it would be ditching it in favor of its own in-house architecture. That move is potentially fatal for Imagination, as Apple comprises fully half of its revenue. More recently, Bloomberg reported last week that Apple is even developing a new chip dedicated to artificial intelligence applications.  Qualcomm still counts Apple as one of its largest customers, but that business is under siege on all fronts. Apple's lawsuit represents an existential threat to Qualcomm's licensing business, since Apple argues that the very structure of its royalty agreements is wholly inappropriate (despite Qualcomm having hundreds of similar agreements with smartphone manufacturers all around the world). If Apple were to win in court, manufacturers could revolt en masse, seeking more favorable terms. At the same time, Apple is actively moving its baseband modem purchases away to its newfound second supplier, Intel, and is very clearly working on its own cellular capabilities. An Apple-designed A-series processor featuring integrated cellular connectivity is still probably a few years out, but once it's ready to ship, Apple won't need to buy baseband modems from either supplier. Even if it's years away, that's a pretty massive risk factor for Qualcomm, and one that one of its former employees could be about to facilitate. Evan Niu, CFA owns shares of Apple.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Are Apple's Stock Buybacks Still Working for Investors? As Apple’s share repurchases have continued at a torrid pace even as Apple's stock price has risen, how should investors view this trend? Andrew Tonner (TMFTheDude) May 31, 2017 at 9:13AM How productive has tech giant Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock buyback program been? The short answer is that it's been extremely effective in enhancing shareholder value since its 2012 inception. The company has wisely spent money scooping up its undervalued shares, reducing shares outstanding and boosting EPS.  Yet stock repurchases have continued unimpeded in recent quarters, even as the Mac maker's stock price has soared in anticipation of the company's forthcoming redesigned iPhone. AAPL data by YCharts As great as Apple's buybacks have been, with the stock trading at highs is the company at risk of destroying shareholder value by overpaying for its own shares? Let's look at the most recent update on Apple's buyback program and consider how investors should understand it in light of the market's increased bullishness on Apple stock. Apple's buybacks continue In its recent earnings report, Apple supplied a supplemental update to its capital return program. The document shows that the pace of the tech giant's share repurchases continued at full steam during the company's fiscal second quarter. Looking back by fiscal year, we see Apple increased the pace of its buybacks by $5 billion dollars in the company's two most recent quarters, even as its stock price continued to climb. Time Open Market Purchases Accelerated Share Repurchases Total FY 2013     $9.0 $14.0 $23.0 FY 2014 $24.0 $21.0 $45.0 FY 2015 $30.0 $6.0 $36.0 FY 2016 $17.0 $12.0 $29.0   Last 12 months $16.0 $18.0 $34.0 Data source: Apple investor relations.All figures in billions. All told, Apple has repurchased a whopping $151 billion in shares since 2012. And in its latest earnings report, Apple's board of directors approved another expansion of its capital return program. The total dollar value allocation now stands at a cool $300 billion, $210 billion of which is earmarked specifically for share repurchases. Apple's buybacks have been an unequivocal boon to its shareholders since it began. A major reason for that has to do with the fact that Apple shares have been fairly cheap, often at a P/E somewhere in the low-teens in recent years. In fact, Apple's buybacks are plainly the reason that the company's EPS increased 41% over the last five years, much faster than the 14% net income expansion over the same period. But we have to ask again: With Apple's valuation metrics pushing against all-time highs, could Apple be destroying shareholder value, especially if shares continue to climb? Image source: Apple Are Apple shares still a buy?   Wall Street currently rates Apple stock as a buy, even as shares hover around the consensus 12-month price target of $154.36.  Yet Apple remains cheaper than the broader market, its P/E multiples remain well below those of the market, at 19 times current earnings and 14 times forward earnings, compared with 25 times earnings for the S&P 500. And that doesn't even back out the massive $158 billion net-cash balanceon Apple's balance sheet. The likely explanation behind the disconnect between Apple's valuation and growth potential lies in its size. As the largest publicly traded company in the world, Apple's sheer size will make growing its top line increasingly difficult in the coming years, though thankfully Apple seems have have plans in place to address this critical issue. In the medium to long term, Apple is working to establish itself in many of tech's most important future growth markets. Areas like electric vehicles, smart home operating systems and hardware, healthcare, and more are truly massive global market. As just one example, the global automotive industry drives as much as $2 trillion in annual economic output. If Apple can grab even a fraction of some of such a market, it could dramatically increase the company's sales and profit bases. And in the short term, of course, the coming iPhone 8 should trigger a wave of upgrades and new purchases that will improve Apple's financial performance even further. Truth is, investors only really have to worry about companies buying back shares if the stock is trading at an unsustainable valuation. With Apple, the story has always been management smartly buying up undervalued shares and boosting core financials.

Chip Executive The iDevice maker just snapped up a top mobile chip industry executive, but this hire might not mean what you think it does. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) May 31, 2017 at 9:15AM As noted by AppleInsider, Neil Shah of Counterpoint Research has observed  that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) successfully poached chip executive Esin Terzioglu from wireless-chip giant Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), to work as a "wireless system-on-a-chip lead." This news led a social-media account owned by semiconductor-related website WikiChip to ask if Apple is "planning on ditching Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) for their own baseband processor." Although Apple may very well be planning to build its own cellular modem technology in-house, I don't think that the company's poaching of this executive necessarily tells us that. Image source: Apple. Several possibilities The term "wireless system on a chip" may not necessarily refer to Apple's A-series system on a chip. For example, Apple may be interested in building chips with integrated wireless capabilities for other product lines, such as the Apple Watch, a product line that would probably benefit from integrated wireless technology, or future Apple W-series chips aimed at future iterations of the AirPod wireless earbuds and similar products. Or the executive could be headed to Apple to work on chips in support of a completely new product category that we simply aren't aware of yet. There is also, of course, the possibility that Apple does, in fact, want to build its own cellular and/or Wi-Fi chips in support of future iPhones. And, finally, the term "wireless system on a chip" may simply refer to a system on a chip that's used in a wireless device such as the iPhone or the iPad but doesn't necessarily include wireless capabilities. In other words, the executive may simply be working on a next-generation A-series processor. Here's the real point, though The real story here, in my mind, is that this is yet another example of Apple's ability to lure the industry's best chip talent. Although Qualcomm's chip business stumbled a bit in recent years -- the Snapdragon 810 was hardly the company's best moment -- the company generally produces leading merchant mobile processors each year. That technological leadership across various pricing tiers, from chips targeted at sub-$100 phones all the way to chips aimed at flagship devices, has helped the company maintain high unit and revenue share within the merchant mobile applications processor market. It's also well understood that Apple's mobile-chip teams are top notch, and the company has the unique benefit of needing to work on a relatively small portfolio of chips targeted at its own high-end devices. Not only that, but Apple also benefits from the fact that it tightly controls its software ecosystem and does so arguably better than any other smartphone vendor does, allowing it to tailor its chips precisely to its needs. That said, it's always good for a company to have as many of the industry's best and brightest technical and managerial minds under its wing, and it looks as though Apple has scored nicely in bringing Terzioglu into the fold. One more thing It's worth noting that chip development cycles are relatively long -- they're measured in years, not weeks or months. So the impact that Apple's new hire will have on the company's product pipeline -- if he does, indeed, significantly have an impact on it -- won't be visible to consumers orn investors for years to come.

Here's what to expect WWDC 2017 runs from June 5 to June 9 By Matt Burgess 1 day ago By Matt Burgess Wednesday 31 May 2017 If you're a developer, the early months of the year can be exciting: Google, Microsoft, and Facebook have all held their annual conferences announcing what they're working on. At the start of June, it is Apple's turn to take centre stage with its own offering. ADVERTISEMENT Europe vs Silicon Valley: behind enemy lines with the woman deciding Google's fate Europe vs Silicon Valley: behind enemy lines with the woman deciding Google's fate Politics 12 Apr 2017 The 2017 Worldwide Developer Conference, announced in February, will see Tim Cook and fellow Apple executives take to the stage to reveal the company's latest work. READ NEXT WIRED Awake: 10 must-read articles for June 1 WIRED Awake: 10 must-read articles for June 1 By WIRED When is the Apple WWDC 2017 keynote? WWDC lasts a week (June 5 to June 9), however, the headline event takes place on the first day. San Jose's McEnery Convention Center will play host to the opening keynote at 18:00 UK time. For those that want to keep up with the entire conference, Apple's WWDC app lists sessions that will be taking place. These focus on Apple's developer programme, Game Center, its TV operating system, and much more. Within the schedule of events, there's also a number of secretive sessions ('Nobody nose what to call this yet' and 'You'll slip when this is revealed') that will relate to the main stage announcements. Apple usually uses the conference to announce its latest software updates. However, there's sometimes a sprinkling of hardware included too. Here's what you can expect from WWDC 2017. ADVERTISEMENT READ NEXT EU agrees €120m funding to give free Wi-Fi to 'every European village and city' EU agrees €120m funding to give free Wi-Fi to 'every European village and city' By Matthew Reynolds iOS 11 for iPhone and iPad It's almost certain that Apple will release its latest iPhone and iPad operating system at this year's WWDC. The event, which is held around the same time each year, almost always sees a new version of the iOS released. In 2016, Apple revealed iOS 10, which included a change to how devices are unlocked, messaging animations and applications, new emoji, and a revamped Apple News section. With the launch of a new iPhone – possibly called the iPhone 8 – later this year, the new iOS will be tailored to work on the upcoming handset. This could include features that will only work on the new device. As with all Apple announcements, the details are largely being kept a secret at the moment. A number of rumours have suggested the iOS will have large Siri updates and a new edition of Apple Music. ADVERTISEMENT READ NEXT Who built Silicon Valley? Blame the hippies Who built Silicon Valley? Blame the hippies By James Temperton Based on past performances, Apple will make the new iOS free for users to upgrade and will release the final public version in autumn 2017. The 'Siri speaker' Amazon's Echo and Google's Home have created a new market for voice recognition AI assistants that are designed for the house. Apple is said to be launching its own Siri-based AI speaker at WWDC. Reports say the device will have seven tweeters and a subwoofer inside. It is expected the device will run a version of iOS and use Beats technology. Rumours about the Siri speaker, which doesn't have an official name, say the device will have a mesh outer shell and prototypes have allegedly included facial recognition, that works with integrated cameras. Apple's marketing boss Phil Schiller has previously hinted that a smart speaker from the firm will have a screen. He said: "So there's many moments where a voice assistant is really beneficial, but that doesn't mean you'd never want a screen. So the idea of not having a screen, I don't think suits many situations". ADVERTISEMENT Mac laptop updates While WWDC is best known for software, Bloomberg has reported Apple is planning to upgrade three of its laptop ranges: the MacBook Pro, 12-inch MacBook and potentially an update to the MacBook Air. As well as hardware updates, it's likely Apple will update macOS to version 10.13. TV and Watch operating systems As well as operating systems for iPhones, iPads and Macs, Apple may also be planning updates to its watchOS and tvOS. A new TV operating system could add picture-in-picture support and the ability for multiple users to connect to the device. WatchOS 3 was launched at WWDC 2016 and added new fitness features as well as a feature called Scribble that lets people write letters on the screen. It's likely this will be followed-up with a fourth version this year. Rumours around the potential new watch operating system say Siri will be improved and there will be more activities that can be tracked.

The company said at the Computex 2017 show this morning in Taipei that it will partner with PC vendors, carriers and chip makers like Intel and Qualcomm on the new initiative. Created a year ago by Apple, Samsung and other players, these SIMs are embedded directly into a device and cannot be removed. But perhaps more important than that, eSIMs are universally compatible with all carriers and as such allow customers to sign up for a wireless service right on their device. First LTE-enabled Windows notebooks featuring eSIM technology (via Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 835 chipset) are on the way from ASUS, HP and Lenovo, said Microsoft. These new Intel x86-based devices will feature Windows 10, always-on LTE connectivity and “great battery life”. Huawei, VAIO and Xiaomi are committed to Always Connected PCs using eSIM technology, too. “There is a new generation of users that need to be connected to the cloud at all times. They are students, creators, freelancers, small businesses and enterprises,” said the Redmond firm. “This means sharing experiences across screens and leveraging the latest network technology like gigabit LTE and eSIM.” The eSIM standard works virtually anywhere in the world, meaning customers are able to switch carrier instantly, no paperwork or a physical SIM card required whatsoever. Apple owns a patent for an LTE-enabled MacBook with wireless antennas integrated within a hinge mechanism, as depicted on the patent drawing below. Updated Mac notebooks are expected at WWDC next week, according to Bloomberg. Ahead of the WWDC keynote, an Apple regulatory filing in Russia has identified five unreleased Mac notebooks, plus a next-generation Magic Keyboard and new iPad Pro models. It’s unclear if these refreshed MacBooks will feature embedded LTE connectivity, but if a next-generation MacBook with an eSIM is lying around somewhere in Jony Ive’s basement now would be a good time to bring it to market.

Historically, navbars have been convenient and clear, easy to understand and easy to build. Then phones ballooned, enough that the iPhone 7 Plus supplanted sales of the iPad mini. Now, if you own a modern iPhone, navbars can feel unwieldy — literally out of touch. Burgeoning screens mean the distance between the navbar and our thumbs has grown. The screen on a 7 Plus is so tall it would take a thumb-length increase of 150 percent to reach those pesky buttons with one hand. Just another knuckle or two. Nothing weird. Hurff’s Touch Zones illustrate right-handed thumb reachability. As devices change, our visual language changes with them. It’s time to move away from the navbar in favor of navigation within thumb-reach. For the purposes of this article, we’ll call that Reach Navigation. Why the Navbar is Out of Touch The Navbar is a mainstay of the “system standard” application, used in Phone, Messages, Mail, Calendar, and countless others. There are lots of reasons it gained favor: iOS Standard Apple built the navbar to be customizable, scalable, accessible, and easy to implement. Because it’s an iOS standard, it’s recognizable across apps. Navigation The left and right sides of the navbar afford space for buttons. The left area often navigates users up in the hierarchy, and the right area is up for grabs. The back button informs users that they’re not at the root view. Title Provides a consistent location for text defining the function of the view. Since the navbar always stays on screen, it helps further establish the information hierarchy. Companion to Tab Bar If you have a row of tappable icons at the bottom of the screen (namely, a Tab Bar), putting other icons at the top of the screen helps separate the parent/child relationship. Logo Your client can put a logo here! Genius. Lol jk, I find this tacky, but I digress. Some sample navbars for your enjoyment. Oh my gosh, so many great reasons to use a navbar in your project. Except, damn! It’s hard to get your thumb up there now. That being the case, let’s talk some Navbar cons: It’s harder to go back. You can swipe from the edge, as long as the view you’re on doesn’t have anything that scrolls horizontally, but if it does then you’re in stretch-town. Naming all the views is a pain. Not all screens need a persistent title, and some require labels too long to fit. Leaving a blank navigation area wastes screen space and looks barren. Navigating requires two hands. If you can hold a device in one hand, you should be able to operate the device with one hand. It feels better, and it’s more convenient in a world full of shopping carts to push, and babies to carry. Simple apps become more complex than necessary. Navbars tend to lead to information architecture that runs deep. It’s easy to develop for horizontal progressive disclosure, which means it can be a battle to expand inline or use a sheet. All right. Now we know how navbars can be crap. So what are we doing? Reach Navigation and Apple As an iOS designer, this is the part where I support my thesis by pointing out how Apple is already incorporating Reach Navigation. Ready? We’ll start with two of the obvious ways Apple is accommodating larger mobile screens. In lieu of a back button, navigate back by swiping from the left edge. First, you don’t have to hit the back button anymore, you can navigate back by swiping from the left edge. You can also control the movement of the screen as it swipes backwards, letting you peek at a previous screen before you commit. It doesn’t work in every app, but when it does you get to watch the back label transition into the title, which is just beautiful. Lightly double-tapping the home button shifts content down. Second, iOS includes a feature called Reachability, where your screen’s contents shift down to help you reach buttons near the top when you lightly double tap the home button. Workable for now, but it feels like a Bandaid solution. Now here’s where the turn toward Reach Nav gets more apparent. Apple has already started weaning their apps off the navbar. Maps and Music both had structural redesigns for iOS 10 that diminished or removed the need for navbars. Apple Music changes from iOS 9 (left) to iOS 10 (right). Removing the Navigation Bar allowed the primary view label to increase in size. Pretty. Now both apps use a sheet you can swipe down to dismiss. Apple Maps changes from iOS 9 (left) to iOS 10 (right). The UI is almost entirely inverted. Map Settings and Lock to Current Location are harder to reach, while Search and Results are prioritized. A few back buttons in Apple Music survived the chop block for iOS 10, but they appear marked for removal in a future OS. It’s silly to earmark so much horizontal space for a button that only occupies 20 percent of the real estate. Apple Music has also reverted to a mere Back label instead of describing the return destination, a cornerstone of the back button’s functionality through the iOS 7 release. The Back button in iOS 10 is taking up a lot of real estate here. Seems temporary, no? Yes. So it seems like this is the direction Apple’s taking, which gives you a chance to shift your designs accordingly. Incorporating Reach Navigation Here are some specifics on how to incorporate Reach Nav in your apps. If you’re working on: A new app using a Tab Bar: Use sheets that pop up from the bottom and can be swiped away. Instead of putting important buttons like Filter or Change View up high , see if you can float them above the Tab Bar. Have some conversations about which features are mission critical, before you choose tabs for your most precious screen real estate. Don’t put a destination button — like Search, Cart, New Message — in the navbar. Either make a tab or embed it in the content area. A new app with no Tab Bar: Try an exposed drawer like Maps, or sheets like Mail. Do I need to say this? Prioritize placing buttons at the bottom of the screen. A revamp of a legacy design: Move the most-used items to the bottom. Make sure swiping from the edge of the screen to go back works for all views. See what you can nest to free up space in the most usable screen areas. Remove important actions from the top right navbar spot, and put them anywhere else. A quick rendition of how Safari could move the address bar to the bottom, remove the toolbar, and still maintain functionality. Finally, there are a few exceptions on putting mission-critical buttons within easy reach. If an action has serious consequences, moving the button out of reach is a way to help your user avoid a mistake. So if a case of fat thumbs might cost someone thousands of dollars, or delete an important document, move those options up a bit. Examples of Reach Nav in the Wild New Apple apps aren’t the only products that are starting to respect Reach Nav. Lyft and Pokémon Go put everything within one-handed reach. Pokémon Go and Lyft employ Reach Navigation. Some other apps like Overcast have started using sheets that let you swipe down. Overcast uses sheets that let users swipe down. The iOS Twitter app removes the need to swipe from the edge of the screen to go back, now you can swipe from anywhere. Expect to see more apps move functionality to the bottom on the most reachable part of the screen. It’s pretty easy to adapt, though apps with excessive features will have the most trouble. Stay In Touch The navbar has been essential part of iOS since Apple released the first developer kit, and it has served us well. But it’s time to let go. Let’s agree to stop sticking important buttons to the top of the screen. Better navigation is within reach.

RSS ALL ARTICLES FEATURES ONLY Search Why Does My iPhone 7 Plus Have Two Cameras? By Harry Guinness on May 31st, 2017 Apple isn’t the first manufacturer to put two cameras on their phone (LG, HTC and Huawei all beat them to it), but Apple’s iPhone 7 Plus is the first to really make a splash. But what’s the advantage of this shiny new two-camera setup? Let’s have a look. The Camera Specs The iPhone 7 Plus has two 12 megapixel cameras, side by side. The first is a wide-angle camera similar to the camera that has always been on iPhones. It’s got a lens with an aperture of f/1.8 and a focal length that’s equivalent to about 28mm on a full frame camera. If you’ve ever used an iPhone’s camera or smartphone camera in general, it will feel pretty familiar. RELATED ARTICLE How Does the “8x” Zoom on My Point-and-Shoot Compare to My DSLR? The difference is in the second camera. It’s got a lens with an aperture of f/2.8 and a full frame equivalent focal length of about 56mm. This means things will appear twice as large when shot with this camera as they do with the wide-angle camera—roughly how things look with your eyes. You can see that in the comparison shots below which were taken a few seconds apart from the same spot. RELATED ARTICLE What Is Image Stabilization, and How Does It Work? There’s one other difference between the two cameras: the wide-angle camera has optical image stabilization, while the telephoto one doesn’t. Using the Two Cameras Using the two cameras is easy. Open your iPhone’s camera app. If you’re in any mode except Portrait, you’ll see a 1x button at the bottom. Tap it to switch to the telephoto camera. When to Use Each Camera Both cameras have different uses. The wide-angle camera should probably still be your go-to. Unless you’ve a reason to use the telephoto camera, the wide-angle camera has a few advantages: it has a faster aperture, optical image stabilization, and a wider angle (which makes it more forgiving to use). RELATED ARTICLE Your Camera’s Most Important Settings: Shutter Speed, Aperture, and ISO Explained The wider aperture means that more light gets let in so your iPhone can use a faster shutter speed. The optical image stabilization keeps your photos sharp even when the shutter speed drops lower than you’d want. Finally, the wider angle means that any camera shake from your hands will have much less effect on the image. Combined, these mean that, especially in low light, you’ll get better pictures from the wide-angle camera. The telephoto camera’s advantage is that it can zoom in further while still taking full resolution images. If you want to get closer, you don’t have to crop the photo. This is great for when you can’t get any nearer with your feet like when you’re doing touristy things, watching sports from the sidelines, or trying to get a photo of a skittish dog. As long as the light is good, the advantages of the wide-angle camera won’t really come into play. RELATED ARTICLE How to Make a Smartphone Photo Look Like it Was Taken With a DSLR Finally, there’s also the iPhone’s new “Portrait Mode”, which uses both cameras together—it’s technically in beta, but works well the vast majority of the time. The telephoto camera is used to take the main photo while the wide-angle camera is used to build a depth map of the scene. This means your iPhone can selectively blur different areas and make it look like it was taken using a DSLR, an effect that until now you needed to use an app like Photoshop to achieve. You can see an example in the image above. The iPhone 7 Plus is undoubtedly a step forward for smartphone cameras. Although you should probably default to the wide-angle camera, the telephoto is really useful in certain circumstances when you can’t physically get closer, or want to use Portrait mode.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars MOBILE How ReMarkable’s targeting writers and sketchers with a $529 tablet that replicates paper Paul Sawers@psawers May 31, 2017 6:02 AM Tablets transformed the personal computer market after Apple unveiled the iPad back in 2010, but with reports suggesting tablet popularity is waning — and Apple alone recently shifting the fewest iPads in a single quarter since the device’s inaugural year — it’s easy to raise an eyebrow at any company entering the tablet fray in 2017. But that is exactly what ReMarkable is doing. However, the Norwegian startup isn’t bringing another dull Android-powered “me too” device to market; instead the company is focusing on writers, sketchers, and doodlers with a “digital paper” tablet that strives to replicate the physical paper experience. The Oslo-based firm first debuted its machine last November, bypassing Kickstarter to open preorders through its own website. The ReMarkable was offered to early adopters for $379, including a special pen and case, but until now the device hasn’t been given a public airing. Above: ReMarkable A few weeks back, however, VentureBeat managed to grab a little hands-on time with a final prototype version and garner a sense for where things are at. But first, here’s a quick recap on exactly what the ReMarkable tablet promises. The paper killer Above: Writing on ReMarkable Ultimately, ReMarkable sees its main competitor as the humble A4 notepad. It’s “an elegant tool for thinking in the digital age” and will be appreciated by those who “cherish the simplicity and power of working on paper,” according to the company’s marketing lingo. Importantly, the ReMarkable doesn’t offer web access — you can’t read tweets, argue with people on Facebook, or get directions to the pub. Instead, the device is for reading, writing, and drawing — everything you can do with standard paper. Above: Sketching on ReMarkable In terms of documents and ebooks, the ReMarkable supports PDF and EPUB formats, with users able to annotate across existing text, a feature that is aimed at professionals, such as lawyers, or at students wishing to make notes next to their academic reading material. For the product, ReMarkable worked closely with E Ink Holdings — the Taiwanese company behind many of the world’s popular e-paper products, including e-readers — to develop a proprietary “CANVAS” display that is as close as possible to paper, but without screen glare and with a higher-friction surface than you’ll be used to with standard tablets. The 10.3″ display, with a 1872 x 1404 (226 PPI) resolution, doesn’t have an on-board light — after all, neither does paper. It’s also worth noting here that ReMarkable is touting its cross-platform credentials, with syncing available via the cloud through mobile and desktop apps. The competition ReMarkable is far from the first company to offer an e-paper device for readers and writers. Sony is among the more notable brands in the space, and a few years back it launched the Sony Digital Paper DPT-S1, a 13.3″ device that started at around $1,100. Sony recently announced a joint venture with E Ink to develop new e-paper products, while just this week the electronics giant announced that a second generation of its e-paper tablets would arrive in the U.S. in June for $700. Where ReMarkable is really looking to set itself apart from others in the space is through lower latency — that is, the time it takes between a user attempting to make an impression on the tablet and the mark actually showing up. For it to replicate real paper, the latency has to be super low, and ReMarkable claims to be able to drive its latency down to 55ms, though the model we tested was around 65ms. “Every other device we have tried has had much slower latency than this, usually upwards of about 100ms, which gives the feeling that the ink is chasing the pen,” a company spokesperson told VentureBeat. Though we weren’t able to carry out a thorough latency test during our brief hands-on earlier this month, our doodling and writing did reveal a more or less undetectable gap between putting pen to “paper” and the mark appearing. It really did feel as though we were working with paper, including the friction between the pen and the tablet. The story so far During the preorder phase, ReMarkable shifted more than 27,000 units, which amounted to over $11 million in sales. Though the ReMarkable has been available on preorder for six months already, the company has now confirmed that the full pricing for the device at launch will be $529, while the pen will set you back $79. Given that the tablet relies heavily on the pen, it is a little odd that the company would provide pricing for the ReMarkable without a pen, though it did confirm that it would be announcing a separate bundled price at a later date. It does seem that the company envisages people buying a unit purely for reading purposes, even though there are better and much cheaper e-readers on the market already. As things stand, ReMarkable expects to begin shipping the first preorder units in late August, and anyone ordering from today can expect their order to arrive in October. Though it’s far too early to say whether the ReMarkable will hit the sweet spot among the world’s writers and doodlers, part of me thinks that its price point will discourage many prospective buyers — beyond a hardcore niche group — from investing in one of these tablets. At around $600 for the tablet and pen, it’s not the sort of device someone would buy as a present for a friend or family member, and those who already own a scanner may decide to stick with their trusty ballpoint pen and notepad. That’s not to say that the ReMarkable doesn’t offer a significant number of add-on features for the digital age, it’s just that $600 is perhaps a little too pricey for what may ultimately prove to be more of a luxury item than a necessity for many.

Valentina Palladino - May 31, 2017 1:04 pm UTC Enlarge Apple reader comments 27 Share this story After announcing the show last summer, Apple has finally given a release date to its Carpool Karaoke series. The show, with half-hour long episodes, will debut on Apple Music on August 8, with new episodes coming every Tuesday. Further ReadingReport: Apple will go up against Netflix, HBO, others with scripted TV shows Carpool Karaoke: The Series is a spinoff of James Corden's popular segment on The Late Late Show with James Corden. According to Apple's statement, each episode will feature a new group of celebrities singing their favorite songs together in different situations. Released images show John Legend, Alicia Keys, Michael Strahan, Jeff Gordon, LeBron James, and James Corden making appearances, while Apple revealed Taraji P. Henson, Queen Latifah, Miley Cyrus and the entire Cyrus family, and Game of Thrones' Sophie Turner and Maisie Williams will also be on the show. James Corden is the show's creator and executive producer, but it doesn't appear he'll be joining every group of celebrities in every episode. The show was supposed to debut back in April, but Apple pushed the release back for undisclosed reasons. There's no word yet on how many episodes are in the first season, nor how many more seasons could come in the future. Carpool Karaoke: The Series will be available exclusively to Apple Music subscribers in more than 100 countries. James Corden will continue to do his own Carpool Karaoke segments on his show, and those video clips regularly trend on YouTube and glean millions of views. Corden's Carpool Karaoke video with Adele was the most viral video on YouTube in 2016. Carpool Karaoke: The Series isn't Apple's only original programming endeavor; the company is also working on Planet of the Apps, a Shark Tank-like reality show in which developers pitch their app ideas to celebrities including Will.I.Am in hopes of receiving support and funding.

The company has continued to explore the idea, with a patent on the concept emerging just last year. Steve Jobs revealed in 2008 that Apple rejected the idea for a couple of reasons. First, that it would add complexity to the device, and second that it would lock customers in to a particular carrier. Neither argument applies today, and news that a number of major Windows laptop manufacturers are committed to producing LTE-equipped laptops is likely to put pressure on Apple to revisit the idea … NordVPN The complexity idea hasn’t really applied for some time. Antennas have grown ever smaller, and Apple even has a patent for hiding it within the hinge mechanism of a MacBook. Multifunction radio chips mean that it doesn’t take up any more space to add LTE capability to a device which already supports WiFi and Bluetooth. Intel has made things even easier by announcing that it is making current and future wireless chips compatible with e-SIMs, so no SIM tray will be needed – which also means Jony Ive need have no concerns about breaking up the clean lines of a MacBook. This follows a similar announcement by Qualcomm last year. And because e-SIMs offer worldwide cross-carrier support, there’s no danger of being locked into a single provider. So there’s no reason not to do it – and there are clear arguments for doing so. Microsoft has just announced that six major PC manufacturers are committed to producing LTE-capable laptops. We are collaborating with our ecosystem on a shared vision. This starts with a close partnership at the silicon layer, with Intel and Qualcomm and with our mobile operator partners to provide seamless eSIM connectivity. Microsoft device partners ASUS, HP, Huawei, Lenovo, VAIO, and Xiaomi, are committed to this new category of Always Connected PCs using eSIM technology. In addition, Microsoft announced Always Connected devices will be coming from ASUS, HP, and Lenovo on the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 chipset. These new devices will feature Windows 10, always-on LTE connectivity and great battery life. So LTE laptops are about to go from a niche product category to something very, very mainstream. It could well become a feature that laptop buyers quickly come to expect as standard, which could leave Apple looking decidedly behind the times if it doesn’t join the party. Last time we asked you, some 42% thought Apple would definitely or probably make an LTE-enabled MacBook. This time we’re asking how many think it’s a good idea. Given the built-in e-SIM capability and multifunction radio chips, it’s extremely unlikely that the feature would add more then pennies to the production cost, so it shouldn’t impact prices. Assuming that to be the case, how many of you would like to see LTE capability added to future MacBooks? Please take our poll, and share your views in the comments.

Digital Trends Home > Movies & TV > Apple finally reveals ‘Carpool… Apple finally reveals ‘Carpool Karaoke’ debut date after unexplained delay By Trevor Mogg — Updated May 31, 2017 6:11 am Subscribe Share Subscribe on YouTube Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you If you're an Apple Music subscriber, the new video content will give you a little more for your money. Apple has finally set the date for the launch of its Carpool Karaoke show. The in-car, A-list celebrity sing-along made famous by James Corden on The Late Late Show will be available to Apple Music subscribers starting August 8, the tech giant revealed on Tuesday. The weekly show is set to feature a slew of famous folks from the world of music, television, film, sports, and pop culture “buckling up and belting out their favorite songs for a road trip filled with comedy, conversation, and music.” So who exactly can viewers expect to see across the 16 original episodes of the debut season? According to Apple, celebrity pairings will include Will Smith and James Corden; Miley, Noah, Billy Ray, and the entire Cyrus family; Shakira and Trevor Noah; Game of Thrones stars Sophie Turner and Maisie Williams; Queen Latifah and Jada Pinkett Smith; John Legend, Alicia Keys and Taraji P. Henson; LeBron James and Corden; and “many more.” Apple released a Carpool Karaoke teaser (above) in February ahead of an expected April launch, but it was postponed for reasons unknown. Corden and director/producer Ben Winston created the format, with the very first effort featuring Corden and the late George Michael in a sketch aired by the BBC back in 2011. Talking about The Late Late Show‘s success with Carpool last year, Corden said, “It’s the interviews that I’m most proud of. Because the question is, what makes a good interview? Seeing someone in a way that you’ve never seen them before — finding something out about someone that you’ve never known before. And I feel like when I watch the interviews that we’ve done in cars with people, I’m like, ‘Oh, I’ve never seen the Red Hot Chili Peppers like that before,’ or, ‘I’ve never seen Elton John like that before.’ That’s it.” Carpool will also continue to appear as part of The Late Late Show on CBS.

India has offered its own electronics manufacturing road map to global tech giant Apple to comply with as it kick-starts local production of its flagship product iPhone and carve up a larger chunk of the country’s fast-growing smartphone market. “We have drawn a road map of indigenisation, in consultation with the industry over the past two years. We have shared it (with Apple) and asked them to align with it… we don’t need to give them any separate concessions. Apple said they will examine this and get back,” said Aruna Sundararajan, secretary to the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology. Apple did not comment. It had requested the government to grant it 15 years of duty-free import of components to assemble its iPhones in the country, sharing a road map to slowly indigenise products. The government has instead chalked out its own National Policy on Electronics to achieve its goal of a $400-billion market in the sector by 2020. Earlier this month, the Cupertino-headquartered firm conducted a trial run for producing its low-cost iPhone SE at Taiwanese contract manufacturer Wistron’s facility in Bengaluru. Apple in a statement said its “Made in India” iPhones would hit store shelves in late May. “They have big plans for India and they definitely intend, as they have told us, to make all their products in the next phase, for which they are evaluating various options. The first thing they had requested was 15 years of duty-free imports of their components,” said Sundararajan. India has maintained that it would not offer any concessions specifically to Apple produce smartphones locally, but would instead come up with concessions that would benefit all smartphone makers looking to set up manufacturing operations in the country. It also rejected Apple’s request to set up local plants to refurbish used iPhones, which it intended to offer to local customers at lower prices. As it looks to expand its share beyond the 2-3 per cent in India’s 100-million smartphone market, Apple is looking at localisation of production in order to compete with Chinese rivals such as Xiaomi, Oppo and Vivo, apart from its primary rival Samsung. Currently, Apple sells four-year-old models such as the iPhone 5S to compete in India’s mid-level smartphone segment. “We continue to strengthen our local presence across the entire ecosystem, and we’re very optimistic about our future in this remarkable country with its very large, young, and tech-savvy population, a fast-growing economy, and improving 4G network infrastructure,” Tim Cook told investors during Apple’s most recent quarterly earnings call. The firm is looking at India as its next big market, at a time when iPhone sales have begun dropping in its two largest markets - the US and China.

That’s because Apple is expected to announce a refresh of the series at its WWDC 2017 keynote. While the company hasn’t explicitly stated that it’s doing so, it is offering a clue in that regard indirectly through its website. MacRumors reports that Apple’s US online store is now showcasing a free delivery estimate of June 6 to 8 for the 15-inch MacBook Pro, much longer than the standard same day or next day timelines usually offered. The dates clearly coincide with the WWDC, leading many to believe that the company is preparing to launch new laptops at the event. The 13-inch MacBook Pro notably isn’t facing any such delays in delivery. The version without a Touch Bar may just get a price cut post WWDC since it’s apparently not doing as well as the variants with the feature. Apple apparently hopes that the drop will help sales. Also See: Apple patent transforms your iPhone or iPad into a MacBook Rumors so far have indicated that the new MacBook Pro models will mostly boast of internal upgrades rather than major design changes. This makes sense since it hasn’t even been a year since the 2016 edition of the notebooks came out. Apple had previously left a gap of nearly 1.5 years between MacBook Pro upgrades. The shorter update timeline may have something to do with the heavy criticism the 2016 model received in the months since its launch. The 2017 variant will likely address those criticisms with more efficient Intel Kaby Lake processors and up to 32GB of desktop-class RAM. Other than its MacBook Pro range, Apple may also upgrade its 12-inch MacBook series at the WWDC. We’ll keep you updated as and when more details unfold on June 5.

Mortgage lending grew £2.7bn, the least since April 2016, new data from the Bank of England shows.

Meanwhile, consumers took advantage of low interest rates to rack up an extra £1.5bn of unsecured debt in April. Consumer credit has risen by 10.3 per cent in the past twelve months, the Bank of England said.  That suggests shoppers may be compensating for rising prices by taking on cheap debt to finance purchases.

The “exceptionally-sized” stone was presumed not to be real because 19th Century diamonds were not cut to show off their brilliance like today's gems.

The ruling is the latest in a long running legal battle between the Swiss-based company and its rival Cadbury. Nestlé argues that the KitKat’s shape is “iconic” and should be protected by law but Cadbury objects. On Wednesday, the Court of Appeal ruled in favour of Cadbury, dismissing the claim. iStock 9/29 Yorkshire is the best region in the UK for workplace happiness - Tuesday 16 May The best region in Britain for workplace happiness and satisfaction is Yorkshire and the Humber, according to new research.

The supermarket said on Friday that it would start selling the misshapen and superficially blemished fruits for 39p each or £2.40 a kilogramme in the majority of its stores across the UK starting from 15 May until the end of the summer.

On Tuesday, the World Trade Organisation ruled that Mexico is allowed to impose $163m (£127m) a year in sanctions against the US on trade in tuna, ending a years-long dispute.

The oval-cut 59.6 carat jewel, discovered in a mine in Africa by De Beers in 1999, is the largest fancy vivid pink diamond, categorised as “flawless” or “internally flawless”, that the Gemological Institute of America (GIA) has ever graded.

Getty Consumer demand is not slowing as rapidly as a slump in official first-quarter retail sales data had previously suggested, though rising inflation - fuelled by increased energy costs and the pound's slump after the Brexit vote - has not yet fully filtered through to households. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown said: “The one saving grace for UK consumers is mortgage interest rates are still at extremely low levels, highlighting the bind that the Bank of England finds itself in.  “Despite rising inflation it’s really in no position to raise interest rates anytime soon without damaging the engine of the British economy. Consequently we can still expect UK interest rates to remain low for some considerable time yet.” More about: Mortgages housing market Brexit Consumer Credit Reuse content Comments Most Popular Video Sponsored Features Follow us: User Policies Privacy Policy Cookie Policy Code of Conduct Complaint Form Contact Us Contributors All Topics Archive Newsletters Jobs Subscriptions Advertising Guide Syndication Evening Standard Novaya Gazeta Install our Apps We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

International Business Times UK UK World Business Politics Fintech Technology Science Sport Entertainment Opinion Video Pictures Log out Newsletter Signup Smartphones Cybersecurity Innovation Social Media Games Motoring Technology Buying a new MacBook this week is a really bad idea - here's why Apple is expected to update its MacBook range at its annual WWDC event on 5 June. By Alistair Charlton May 31, 2017 13:13 BST Put that MacBook down. Apple is set to update its laptop range on 5 JuneReuters Step away from the Apple Store and put your credit card away, because now is a really bad time to buy a new MacBook. Let us explain. Apple's annual Worldwide Developer Conference, or WWDC, kicks off on 5 June with a keynote address led by company CEO Tim Cook. New products are always expected from WWDC, but this year the volume of rumours surrounding an update to Apple's laptop lineup mean you should hold off for now. The MacBook Pro, MacBook Air and regular MacBook lines are all expected to be updated at WWDC, according to Bloomberg, which has a strong track record for Apple gossip. The website reported: "Apple is planning three new laptops, according to people familiar with the matter. The MacBook Pro will get a faster Kaby Lake processor from Intel Corp...Apple is also working on a new version of the 12in MacBook with a faster Intel chip. The company is also considering updating the aging 12in MacBook Air with a new processor as sales of the laptop, Apple's cheapest, remain surprisingly strong, one of the people said." By adopting Kaby Lake processors, the MacBook Pro range is expected to get a boost to both performance and battery life. The entire Mac lineup is marked as 'don't buy' or 'caution' by the MacRumors buying guide, which tracks how often Apple traditionally updates each product, then states how many days it has been since the last refresh and whether consumers should buy now or wait. At the time of publication, the MacBook, Apple's smallest laptop, has not been updated for 407 days compared to an average of 375 days. The MacBook Air, however, has gone 814 days since an update compared to an average of 350. The MacBook Pro is the newest of the Apple laptop family, having seen an update 216 days ago. This is just over 100 days short of the computer's average, but MacRumors has applied a caution note to it regardless. Further evidence of a refresh comes from the online Apple Store, which reports a week-long delivery time for some models of MacBook Pro, suggesting that stock is drying up in anticipation of something new. As Apple blog 9to5Mac states: "When shipping dates lapse at the Apple Online Store, it is often a good indicator that a new version is coming soon. When those dates coincide with an Apple event, it's an even stronger signal." The iMac, Apple's desktop computer, is also well overdue an update at 596 days compared to an average of 317 and the Mac Mini sits at 958 days, over double the average update cycle. But, for now, all rumours point towards WWDC 2017 being about MacBooks - and an Amazon Echo rival dubbed the Siri Speaker.

Where will the iPhone 8 be built? Donald Trump wants Apple to build its iPhones in the US. Can he succeed with the iPhone 8? by David Price | 31 May 17 Donald Trump spent much of his presidential campaign complaining about Apple and its offshore manufacturing operations, and promising he would make the company build its iPhones in the US. Now he's trying to make his promises a reality. In this article we discuss where the iPhone 8 is likely to be built. Read more: Where are Apple products made? Speaking to the New York Times, Trump claimed to have spoken on the phone with Tim Cook and reached a degree of understanding about the matter. "I got a call from Tim Cook at Apple," reported Trump, "and I said, 'Tim, you know one of the things that will be a real achievement for me is when I get Apple to build a big plant in the United States, or many big plants in the United States, where instead of going to China, and going to Vietnam, and going to the places that you go to, you're making your product right here.' He said, 'I understand that.'" Apple has its reasons for building its smartphones in Asia, of course: labour costs are lower and there is, according to Cook, a shortage of relevant skills in the US. Moving manufacturing to America would lose Apple a lot of money. But Trump thinks he can sweeten the deal. "I said: 'I think we'll create the incentives for you, and I think you're going to do it. We're going for a very large tax cut for corporations, which you'll be happy about.' But we're going for big tax cuts, we have to get rid of regulations, regulations are making it impossible." What Trump did not claim - and past behaviour suggests he'd be singing it from the rooftops - is that Cook actually agreed to any of this, even in principle. Since then, Trump has stated in an interview with Axios that Tim Cook has his "eyes open" to the idea of building iPhones in the US, and that he "really believes [Cook] loves this country and I think he'd like to do something major here", whatever that means. Foxconn's US expansion There was another twist in this tale when it emerged on 7 December 2016 that iPhone manufacturer Foxconn is indeed pondering an expansion of its (currently relatively small-scale) US operations, in a move that is apparently expected to involve $7bn of investment and create 50,000 jobs. Eagle-eyed journalists spotted that paperwork being shown off to publicise SoftBank's US investment deal also featured Foxconn's logo, and appeared to suggest that the second figure in each pair of numbers referred to that company.

"While the scope of the potential investment has not been determined, we will announce the details of any plans following the completion of direct discussions between our leadership and the relevant US officials," the firm said in a statement, according to Reuters.

Like past many years... Read More NEW DELHI: The latest leak related to the upcoming Apple flagship smartphone -- iPhone 8 -- hint at a shape change. The leaks come courtesy one of the Apple's biggest manufacturing partners, chipset maker TSMC. TSMC reportedly indicated these design changes of the 'iPhone 8' at its recent 'TSMC 2017 NA Technology Symposium' held in Taipei earlier this month. According to a report in DigiTimes, Apple iPhone 8 could come with a completely new design with an elongated display. The report says that the smartphone will have an 18.5:9 aspect ratio, similar to the one in the Galaxy S8 and LG G6 smartphones. View As Photolist » 7 'new features' iPhones may get in September 18 7 'new features' iPhones may get in September Apple recently announced the dates of WWDC 2017, its biggest software event of the year. Like past many years, this time too the event will see the company unveiling the next- generation of its iOS operating system, iOS 11. The iOS powers the company's iPhones and iPads. The all-new iOS will debut with the company's 2017 edition of iPhones in September and will also be rolled out to previous-generation (eligible devices) iPhones. Here are seven 'new features' that Apple iPhones are speculated to get in September 2017. Transcribe Voicemail into text While this feature is already available in iOS 10, its limited to the OS’ beta versions only. It allows users to transcribe all their voicemails to texts. 'All-new' Siri Rumours claim that the Cupertino-based technology giant is planning a slew of changes for its digital assistant. These reportedly include ability to use Siri offline. Another rumoured feature is Siri may get across-platform support, which means it can follow a command you gave on your iPhone on your iPad. The company is also said to be working on changing the voice of Siri. Reports claim that Apple is working on making Siri sound more natural and less robotic. Augmented Reality This is supposed to be one of the biggest features of the upcoming iPhones. The company is said to be betting big on it. Earlier this year, CEO Tim Cook termed AR 'as a big idea like the smartphone'. The famous Apple analyst KGI Securities Ming-Chi Kuo too said that Apple's upcoming iPhone, dubbed iPhone 8, will support 3D sensing, AR and biometric authentication. In a note to clients, Kuo reportedly wrote that a pair of sensors on the FaceTime camera will help iPhone 8 provide features ranging from 3D sensing and modelling to advanced biometric authentication. Drop support for 32-bit Apple is reportedly all set to drop 32-bit support with the iOS 11 release. The company has been warning about this to developers since February this year. This means that the apps that haven't been updated to support 64-bit processor will not work on Apple's next version of operating system, iOS 11. Some 200,000 apps on App store are said to be become obsolete due to this. (Image Courtesy: findicons.com) Dark Mode iOS 11 may finally bring ‘Dark mode’ to iPhones and iPads. The feature is already available in beta version(s) of iOS 10 and may finally be rolled out to all users with the new mobile operating system. Group FaceTiming calling Group FaceTime calling is one of the biggest features of Microsoft's Skype that has been missing in Apple's chat app Facetime. With iOS 11, the company is speculated to add 'group calling' to Facetime. Improved Maps Attempting to catch up to rival Google Maps, Apple is reportedly planning to use a fleet of drones to improve its mapping data. The company is believed to have assembled a team of data collection experts and robotics, responsible for mapping location and map data using drones, instead of the regular mini vans with cameras and other sensors. The new aspect ratio will reportedly help the manufacturers to increase the size of the display without hampering its one-hand usage. But at the same time, it is also expected to make app developers to rework on the user interface. As they will need to customize their apps to utilise the new display size and aspect ratio. The extended display is being rumoured to be called as the 'function area'. The report further adds that Apple is also removing the 'home button' in its upcoming iPhone device. Scheduled to be rolled out in the second half of 2017, the company is expected to integrate Touch ID right into the display. Apple iPhone 8 rumours hint at an 'optical fingerprint sensor' The new iPhones are also expected to sport infrared image sensors ‘to enhance the functionality of high-pixel camera’ and for augmented reality applications, as per the report. Earlier rumours have claimed almost a bezel-less design for the 2017 edition of Apple iPhones. Past alleged leaks and renders have shown designs with a display extanding all the way from top to bottom, including the area where the home button lies. Quoting TSMC an iclarified report also says that the new iPhone devices "will also come with invisible infrared image sensors to enhance the functionality of high-pixel camera and to enable AR applications." Recently, a tipster going by the name Benjamin Geskin (@venyageskin1) on Twitter said that the launch keynote of iPhone 8, 7s and the 7s Plus will take place on September 17. It has been further mentioned that the device's sales will begin on September 25. However, it's still not clear if this is the date for the US or other regions and for which model.

Palo Alto-based Essential said the new Essential Phone features an edge-to-edge screen, a titanium-and-ceramic case and dual cameras. The phone sells for $699 and will run the Android operating system. The price pits it against high-end smartphones including Apple’s iPhone and Samsung's Galaxy S8. Essential also launched a household assistant called Home that looks like an angled hockey puck with a screen. The device will compete against the Amazon.com Echo and Alphabet's Google Home speaker, which are powered by the Alexa and the Google Assistant voice services respectively. Essential confirmed the Home device will let the user choose between Alexa, Google Assistant or Siri. It was not immediately clear how Siri would be available on Essential. While Amazon and Google have released the software needed to embed their assistants on devices they do not make, Apple has not done so. Essential declined to elaborate on how it plans to embed Siri on the device, and Apple declined to comment. The Essential Home takes a page from Apple's privacy playbook. Like an iPhone, the Home will do much of the processing for voice and image recognition on the device itself rather than sending data to remote servers. Essential also said the Home device will communicate with home appliances like lights and thermostats directly over the home network, rather than sending data to remote servers. Apple's HomeKit system takes similar approach. Rubin, Essential's CEO, co-founded Android and sold it to Google in 2005. He ran Google's mobile efforts until 2013 before a brief stint running the firm's robotics division. He left Google in 2014 to focus on starting hardware companies. Investors in Essential include Chinese tech company Tencent Holdings, iPhone contract manufacturer Foxconn, Redpoint Ventures and Altimeter Capital. Essential plans to announce a ship date for the devices in the next few weeks. The company did not say whether it planned to sell the phone directly to customers online or in physical stores. Essential for the first time revealed its staff on its website, listing Wolfgang Muller as head of channel sales. Muller previously ran North American retail operations for phonemaker HTC, according to his LinkedIn profile, suggesting that Essential plans to sell phones through retail stores, carriers or both.

The company updated online availability of its 15-inch MacBook Pro with OLED Touch Bar, with the device now estimated to be shipped between June 6 to June 8 in the US. Generally, Apple takes a day or two to ship the laptop at your doorsteps. Apple typically uses the annual developers’ conference to unveil new software updates to existing devices. However, for a change, Apple could introduce new MacBook models at this year’s WWDC. The 13-inch MacBook Pro is still in stock; unfortunately, you can’t buy a 15-inch MacBook Pro from the company’s online store in the US. This seemingly confirms new models might be on the way next week. While Apple recently updated its MacBook Pro lineup at the end of last year, it’s being said that the company is planning to upgrade the internal specifications across the board. The step might entice many of its core professional users who initially considered the MacBook Pro to be underpowered. Most of the updates are said to improve internal hardware, instead of tweaking the design. The 2017 MacBook Pro is currently powered by Intel’s Skylake processors, which were initially unveiled way back in 2015. A Bloomberg report earlier this month revealed that Apple would announce updates to its MacBook Pro lineup at WWDC 2017 in June. The report stated that Apple might launch the new MacBook Pro, the 12-inch MacBook, and an update to the MacBook Air. Apple’s entire MacBook Pro lineup will be powered by Intel’s Kaby Lake processor series. At this year’s WWDC, we’re likely to see the latest version of macOS, iOS 11 and new software updates to tvOS and watchOS. We may also see the launch of the company’s Siri-powered smart speaker system.

Once circulated, an initiative petition must receive the signature of registered voters equal to eight percent of ballots cast in the 2016 governor’s election in six of the state’s eight U.S. congressional districts. One ballot title now being circulated in the public is the brain child of Winston Apple, a retired high school teacher from Independence.  Apple ran for lieutenant governor in last year’s primary election as a Democrat. His proposal for next year’s ballot would rearrange the state legislature and alter the election process. First, the number of state representatives would be reduced from 163 to 80, with 10 per congressional district. Perhaps the most significant change would be that candidates would be competing for district wide seats.  Currently, state House members represent much smaller sectors of the public amounting to roughly 30,000 people. Further, Missouri state Senators would no longer have districts, but would run in statewide elections.  With 17 of the state’s 34 Senators running for election every two years, Apple contends a candidate could win a seat with just under 6 percent of the vote. Primary elections for state House and Senate would result in an ordered list of candidates for each office.  In the general election, a voter would cast a ballot for one political party’s ordered list. Finally, the proportion of votes received per political party would determine the candidates elected from each party’s list, in the order on the list. If a district voted 60% for Republican candidates, the GOP candidates with the six highest vote totals would win election.  If the state voted 60% for Republican Senate candidates, the GOP would control 60% of the upper chamber’s seats. If a district had a 65%-35% composition, voter turnout would play a key role in determining whether the party with the voting edge would elect six or seven of its candidates. Apple calls the changes his offering would make to the voting process “proportional representation”.  He contends the current single member district with a winner take all system is flawed. “If you are a Democrat living anywhere other than Kansas City or St. Louis, you’re not very well represented in Missouri” said Apple.  “And if you’re a Republican living in the first or fifth district in St. Louis or Kansas City, you’re not very well represented.” A Pew research poll taken in May of 2016 showed the largest percentage of American voters identified as Independents (39%) followed by Democrats (32%) and then Republicans (23%). Apple claims that under proportional representation, the parties would have to do a better job of attracting voters because there would be more choices than Republicans or Democrats. “If you don’t do a good job of addressing the problems we face in representing the needs of everyone, promoting, the general welfare to quote the preamble of the U.S. Constitution, then you’re not going to get as many seats and these third parties would start to make major inroads.” Much has been written about the ugliness of last year’s Republican governor’s primary in Missouri, where four candidates demonized each other before Eric Greitens emerged as the nominee.  The general election for governor saw a record $54 million spent. Apple thinks elections have been reduced to mudslinging followed by endless fund raising and advertising.  He says campaign tactics would massively change for the better with proportional representation. “What we’d have instead is a very dynamic primary campaign within each party followed by a campaign focused on issues and the problems we face, and which party’s candidates have the best solutions to those problems.” He claims the ordered list of party candidates from which a voter would cast a ballot in the general election would be instrumental in changing the complexion of elections. “The big, big payoff in the general election is you’re focused on the party and its platform.” If Apple’s proposal were adopted in Missouri, state government legislative operating costs costs could decrease nearly $7 million.  However, state and local governments could incur unknown election related costs. Apple has approximately 11 months to collect the necessary signatures to get the initiative placed on the November 2018 ballot.   Share this: Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Filed Under: Legislature, News, Politics & Govt Sports Lindenwood’s run for a D-II baseball championship comes to an end Lindenwood … [Read More...] Mansfield cruises to Class 2 baseball title Mansfield … [Read More...] The Bill Pollock Show–#Chiefs players feel the need to defend Alex Smith, #Royals rookie cool under fire (PODCAST) Last week … [Read More...] Columbia College softball survives and advances Facing … [Read More...] Bell City takes Class 1 baseball state title in six innings.

Palo Alto-based Essential said the new Essential Phone features an edge-to-edge screen, a titanium-and-ceramic case and dual cameras. The phone sells for $699 (£547) and will run the Android operating system. The price pits it against high-end smartphones including Apple's iPhone 7 and Samsung's Galaxy S8 . (Photo: Essential) Essential also launched a household assistant called Home that looks like an angled hockey puck with a screen. The device will compete against the Amazon Echo and Google Home speakers, which are powered by the Alexa and the Google Assistant voice services respectively. Essential confirmed the Home device will let the user choose between Alexa , Google Assistant or Siri . Read More Android user? Apple's new 'Switch to iPhone' campaign wants to convert you It was not immediately clear how Siri would be available on Essential. While Amazon and Google have released the software needed to embed their assistants on devices they do not make, Apple has not done so. Essential declined to elaborate on how it plans to embed Siri on the device, and Apple declined to comment. The Essential Home takes a page from Apple's privacy play book. Like an iPhone, the Home will do much of the processing for voice and image recognition on the device itself rather than sending data to remote servers.

Apple's HomeKit system takes similar approach. Rubin, Essential's CEO, co-founded Android and sold it to Google in 2005. He ran Google's mobile efforts until 2013 before a brief stint running the firm's robotics division. He left Google in 2014 to focus on starting hardware companies. Investors in Essential include Chinese tech company Tencent Holdings, iPhone contract manufacturer Foxconn, Redpoint Ventures and Altimeter Capital. Essential plans to announce a ship date for the devices in the next few weeks. The company did not say whether it planned to sell the phone directly to customers online or in physical stores. Essential for the first time revealed its staff on its website, listing Wolfgang Muller as head of channel sales. Muller previously ran North American retail operations for phone maker HTC , according to his LinkedIn profile, suggesting that Essential plans to sell phones through shops, mobile operators or both.

As per the leaks, the purported iPhone 8 is said to come with an OLED panel, new in display Touch ID paired with facial recognition, updates to 3D Touch, improved waterproofing, wireless charging, and more. Stay tuned to GizBot for more updates! Major Overhaul! As per the report, Apple is said to be testing more than 10 prototype iPhone models, so we are not sure about the final product. The so-called iPhone 8 will have an edge-to-edge display with Touch ID built into the screen itself. Moreover, the rumor suggests that device will be sporting a 5.8-inch display out of which 5.1-inch will be usable and rest dedicated to virtual buttons. As the company is opting for OLED panel, it helps the company to provide a thinner device with low battery consumption, and a better display with high contrast ratio.   Like iPhone 4 Talking about the body, the iPhone 8 will be having glass body similar to that of iPhone 4 that will be built around a polished stainless steel frame. SEE ALSO: Apple iPhone 8: illustration suggests an all new design IP68 feature Like its predecessor, iPhone 8 is also expected to be water resistant that might hold up to rain, splashes, and brief submersion in water. Faster and efficient chipset The yet-to-be-launched iPhone 8 is expected to come with a 10-nanometer A11 chip that will be faster, efficient, and supports wireless charging as well. iPhone 8 will be also supporting iris, facial, or gesture recognition. 3D sensing capabilities Moving on to the camera, both the dual camera setup will be having an optical image stabilization feature. Also, the front camera of the device might also have 3D sensing capabilities that use technology by PrimeSense, allowing it to find the location and depth of objects. Coming to the pricing now, the iPhone 8 will be sold more than $1000, which is quite costly when compared to its predecessor.   Stay tuned to GizBot for more updates!

Here’s what the Macworld staff and readers would like to see. Email a friend To Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Privacy Policy Thank you Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. By Glenn Fleishman Senior Contributor, Macworld | May 31, 2017 3:00 AM PT Credit: Rob Schultz More like this How iCloud Photo Library matches up to Google Photos Photos for iOS and macOS: The limits of liked photos How to turn your Mac into a digital video recorder for over-the-air TV Video MacBook Pro review: The Touch Bar bridges the gap between iPad and Mac Everyone has their gripes about macOS, even if they mostly like it. It’s the rough edges on a product that’s matured and refined over time that keeps scratching at us, though, making us ask for better. I asked people what they’d like to see in macOS 10.13 and added my suggestions from my experience and from reading thousands of your emails over the last few years to our Mac 911 column. (While macOS 10.13 doesn’t yet have a name, I’m going to pretend it will be called Joshua Tree, as Apple has a habit of installing unwanted U2 things.) iTunes Apple The biggest blemish in macOS remains iTunes, something Macworld writers have spilled virtual ink about for years and years. iTunes was an odd choice to add more and more features, but a necessary one, back when iPhones could only sync over USB to a Mac. That was six years ago when that changed. It’s extremely difficult for many users to figure out where any particular feature is and how to manage it if they don’t use it regularly, and the app is simply bloated and out of date. As many readers may know, a lot of iTunes is a wrapper around what are effectively web pages, resulting in slow and erratic display and interaction. Native apps that work as well as those in iOS seem respectful to Mac users. Because iTunes remains deeply integrated across macOS and with iOS, macOS has to be updated to allow an iTunes break up. Many readers want iTunes to more closely resemble iOS organization: Store for managing purchases and your account. Music to handle Apple Music, Internet radio, and one’s own locally stored collection. Video for purchased, rented, and owned movies and television programs. Podcasts for, uh, podcasts. Sync/Backup for those who still use USB with their iPhones or for local backups. (Remember iSync?) Apple downloads iOS apps into iTunes, which is useful only for providing a central place to sync new versions and when restoring from an iTunes backup. It seems unlikely that Apple would add a TV app like that on the Apple TV and in iOS, because its strategy is to push those experiences to mobile or an Apple TV. Allowing a Mac to have the equivalent of Front Row, discontinued in 2011, would blur the lines. Apple could finally put photo and album direct sync into Photos, instead of keeping it stuck in iTunes. One of the biggest single areas of questions we receive to Mac 911 relate to managing albums and other media sync, because the iTunes interface is so terrible. Yes, Apple is pushing iCloud Photo Library as the one true answer; no, it doesn’t work as a good solution for everyone. Photos While Photos seems like a standalone app that Apple could improve separately at any time, and while the company has pushed out sometimes substantial updates since Photos 1.0 between macOS release cycles, it’s deeply connected enough with macOS that major changes come with the system update. Apple I’d estimate about half the questions to Mac 911 relate to the Photos app—or dealing with moving from iPhoto to Photos, or staying on iPhoto because of still-missing Photos features. The wishlist for Photos is mostly a list of what it needs to get right, rather than new features that it could add. Fix your flagship People feature. With some degree of excitement, Apple talked about its new machine-learning-based facial recognition features in Photos for macOS and iOS. And, at release, some of the documentation stated that identified faces and your refinements to that recognition would sync. It doesn’t. It needs to. There’s no sense in having a feature that works with the same library across devices that requires you perform identical pattern-recognition tasks on each device. Apple has been mum when I asked about it. It’s a glaring hole and makes the People feature effectively useless unless you pick a single device to invest your time into organizing faces. Many people still have People stall in recognition. There’s no way to intervene and restart this. There’s troubleshooting in Photos for rebuilding the library; there needs to be troubleshooting for People, too. Sync likes/faves across OSes. You can share photos through iCloud, but Apple runs two incompatible systems for marking favorite photos. Favorites works in iOS and macOS and syncs across iCloud Photo Library, but doesn’t appear in shared albums. You can Like a photo in a shared album only in iOS, even though you can view the album in macSO and at iCloud.com, and those likes don’t carry through. There’s no way to sort or select liked or most-liked media in Photos for iOS, either. Improve album organization. Another key reader complaint is how difficult it is to order albums the way they want and to sort photos within albums. Photos 1.0 was very thin in that regard, and Apple bolstered options over time. But it’s still inadequate compared to the last release of iPhoto, and clearly compared to users’ needs. Revamp the Media picker. Did you ever try to use the Media option at the bottom of any Open dialog box? It’s a hot mess, and if you have a substantial number of photos and videos in iPhoto or Photos, or you have a Mac that’s not among the newest, your system can churn for tens of seconds or longer before starting to display a terrible interface for picking from your library. The integration, speed, and interface all need a re-work to make it easier to include media from apps, rather than exporting or using limited Share options. Integration across OSes Ah, it was only yesterday—well, last fall—that Siri came to macOS after many years of iOS inclusion. And besides Siri’s overall poor quality for common requests, the version in macOS lacks robustness and integration with iOS and tvOS. Generally, macOS should be better connected to the entire ecosystem. Right now, AirDrop and AirPlay remain the most extensively cross-platform implemented options, and as any regular user of them knows, neither is terrific. AirDrop improved a few releases ago to be more reliable, but when it doesn’t work, there’s no way to find the problem. (More generally, Continuity and Handoff have a lot of great cross-platform and cross-device features which work inconsistently for me and many readers who write in.) Safari to iOS and tvOS. AirDrop lets us push web pages, but why can’t we broadcast or display Safari tabs in iOS or tvOS? Colleague Steven Schapansky notes that Google Chrome can “cast” a tab to its Chromecast hardware. Given Apple controls macOS, Safari, tvOS, and iOS, couldn’t Mac users get the same feature? AirPlay is a poor substitute, requiring pushing the whole macOS interface and then arranging full-screen mode. tvOS. A Mac-based remote control is not a terrible idea, even if it’s the form of a limited version of the TV app, as discussed above. While Apple might not want to provide a full version, being able to browse, select, and organize, and then use the Mac interface to control what’s happening on the Apple TV. HomeKit. Confess it: it’s a little silly that you can use an iOS device to control home-automation and smart devices, but your Mac just sits there. And that you need an iPad or Apple TV to act as a hub for HomeKit when you may have an always-on Mac. HomeKit should be just as available as Siri on a Mac, even if you primarily use it through iOS. Mac as an AirPlay destination. Reader Joel Bernstein expressed a common desire that a Mac shouldn’t require special software (like Reflection or Airfoil) to be a video or audio destination for AirPlay. You may not always need to stream from iOS to macOS or between two Macs, but it should be a trivial option for Apple to offer to please those users. Touch ID for more Mac purposes. Sure, Apple built Touch ID into the MacBook Pro, but it did a beautiful job of integrating Touch ID with Apple Pay on the web with Safari, too. For accessing passwords and other kinds of verification, I’d like to see Apple rely on Touch ID as a way to validate someone possesses a device and has the authority to use it. For instance, a broadly supported industry initiative called U2F (Universal Second Factor) allows a USB key and similar devices to act as a strong second factor added to a password by using two-way cryptographic confirmation. After setting up a login with U2F at a website or other service, when you visit again, the site makes sure you are who you say you are, while your side of the transaction validates that the site is real and not spoofed. Apple could build this functionality into iOS and make it a perfect pair with macOS and iOS for highly secure validated logins, important in an era of frequent phishing and cracking attempts. Network help Apple Apple has long offered some of the best features for networking for individuals and small businesses of any computer company. But it’s fallen behind in providing features modern users need. Overhaul file server access. The Finder has long featured two separate ways to connect to networked file servers, but neither is particularly intuitive. While it’s been a long time since the Chooser in pre-OS X days, and nobody wants the Windows approach to network resource selections, Apple could do more to expose available resources on a network and make it easy to connect, maintain a connection, and safely disconnect. Throttling. Many users either have home networks with overage fees or tether to a cellular connection for Internet connectivity at times. There are no individual or collective macOS and iOS features to help manage this. An iCloud-linked approach (including with Family Sharing) that let you tune how much data was used and monitor it across network types could control costs and reveal “chatty” apps and services. Better screen sharing. Compare TeamViewer and Apple’s built-in screen sharing, and you might be shocked at the difference. Among other things, TeamViewer’s more robust networking approach allows it to tunnel out of “double NAT” situations, where a router feeding out private addresses is unfortunately behind another router doing the same. (I have this on my network, where an ISP-supplied router isn’t the one I want to use for my network, but it provides the connection.) iOS support for screen sharing. Third-party apps again offers this, but given Apple’s ecosystem control, why not make it easy for people to work entirely within the company’s apps? Enhance Time Machine. Another creaky part of the Mac world is Time Machine, its integrated backup system. Many readers write in with the desire to control what’s backed up, have better insight into what has been stored, and repair broken sets. It’s a long time coming for Apple to rethink and upgrade this, including offering local encryption options without encrypting the entire backup drive. Why not add backup? While several high-quality Internet backup services offer Mac clients, only a fraction of people who should back up critical data do so. Apple expects people to use iCloud Drive and storage as a quasi-backup, but a more explicit way to back up (not just sync or shift) documents and other files would tie in neatly as an added value for Apple’s iCloud storage. I would wager most people have in the low gigabytes of data they need to backup outside of photos and video.

Image: iDrop News The rendered images were created by Apple updates site iDrop News, which also reported on the iPhone 8’s leaked dimensions. According to the report, the iPhone 8 will be much heftier and larger than the iPhone 7. The iPhone 8 body is said to measure 143.59 x 70.94 x 7.57 millimeters.

Coincidentally, the practically bezel-less screen on the rendered iPhone 8 bears a resemblance to the recently introduced Essential phone by Android co-creator Andy Rubin.

Prasad told the publication that “once things are formalised, we shall come up with a structured response.” The IT minister told ET that while government is listening to Apple’s demands, it too “will need to look towards the Indian market as well.” The news comes after the Press Trust of India reported that Apple has already begun selling its iPhone SE model in India with the “Made in India” label on the back, in small batches. An industry source had pointed out that the batch was a result of a limited trial run and that the phones were manufactured in limited quantities. The same report also pointed out that these were being manufactured by Apple’s Taiwanese manufacturing partner, Wistron Corp. There have been reports that the Indian government has partially given in to Apple’s demands. Back in 23 May this year, a top government official told Reuters that the government had offered Apple Inc the option to import mobile handset components intended for use in local manufacturing tax-free. The tax concessions will be subject to the condition of increasing local value addition over a period of time. Among a set of tax concessions, Apple had initially sought a 15-years tax holiday for all components that it would import for setting up a manufacturing facility in India. A panel of ministries rejected that demand and has offered a phased programme to increase the share of local production in the manufacturing, Aruna Sundararajan, Secretary at the Ministry of Electronics and IT said. Whether or not Apple ends up manufacturing in India. The benefits of the same seem to be far and few. Apple seems to gain more out this deal than its customers in India, who will barely see a price difference when these locally manufactured smartphones go on sale officially.

Macs & Mac OS X | 15 May 2017 | Print  | Comment (11) Apple Releases macOS 10.12.5, iOS 10.3.2, watchOS 3.2.2, and tvOS 10.2.1 by Josh Centers Focusing on bug and security fixes, Apple today updated all of its operating systems: macOS 10.12.5, iOS 10.3.2, watchOS 3.2.2, and tvOS 10.2.1. As always, it pays to wait at least a few days to install these updates. We haven’t heard of any problems out of the gate, but Apple was so parsimonious with release notes that it’s hard to muster much enthusiasm for updating right away. It’s best to err on the side of caution this time. macOS 10.12.5 -- macOS 10.12.5 Sierra is available via Software Update, where it’s a roughly 894 MB download. Alternatively, you can instead download a delta updater (for 10.12.4, 2.15 GB) or combo updater (from any version of 10.12, 2.15 GB). Release notes are sparse, but practically long-winded compared to the notes for the other OS updates. Identified improvements include a fix for an issue where audio may stutter when played through USB headphones, a mysterious claim of enhanced Mac App Store compatibility with future updates, and added support for media-free installations of the Windows 10 Creators Update in Boot Camp. macOS 10.12.5 includes 30 security fixes. iOS 10.3.2 -- The roughly 200 MB iOS 10.3.2 update can be installed in Settings > General > Software Update or via iTunes. However, the release notes say only, “iOS 10.3.2 includes bug fixes and improves the security of your iPhone or iPad.” Remember when we reported on the bugs that caused Mail to ignore named anchors like the article list at the top of TidBITS issues (see “Mail in El Capitan and iOS 9 Ignores Named Anchors,” 5 January 2016)? Apple did fix the problem in Mail in Sierra at some point, but the company didn’t address it in iOS 10, and it remains unfixed in iOS 10.3.2. If only we could make the case that it was a security vulnerability. iOS 10.3.2 integrates 23 security fixes. watchOS 3.2.2 -- Don’t expect more detail from the watch OS 3.2.2 release notes, which offer only the even terser, “This update includes improvements and bug fixes.” You install the 41.7 MB update via the Watch app on your iPhone (in Watch > Settings > General > Software Update). Remember that the Apple Watch must be on its charger, charged to at least 50 percent, and within range of your iPhone, which itself must be on Wi-Fi. Don’t start installing if you’ll want to use the watch again within an hour or so — watchOS updates take surprisingly long to load. watchOS 3.2.2 features 10 security fixes. tvOS 10.2.1 -- With the tvOS 10.2.1 update, Apple is willing to cop only to “This update includes general performance and stability improvements.” You can get the tvOS 10.2 update on your fourth-generation Apple TV via Settings > System > Software Updates > Update Software. tvOS 10.2.1 offers 14 security fixes.   READERS LIKE YOU!

It was, and the iPad otherwise seems in working order too. Phew. Reply Dennis B. Swaney  2017-05-15 19:08 Hmmm, if the fixes aren't important enough for Apple to list, then they aren't important enough for me to waste time installing them and the possibility they will brick my iDevices. Reply Simon  2017-05-15 19:46 I'd have to agree with that. Apple not telling people what they update (a simple list would be fine) but expecting users to just follow blindly is simply rude. No wonder power users are so cautious to update. Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-15 20:22 From the bug fix standpoint, that's certainly true, and we don't recommend installing it now. But you really do want to install it at some point, since there are a bunch of security fixes, which Apple does describe. Reply Phil Seymour  2017-05-15 21:43 I read the 30 security fixes for OSX or whatever they want to call Sierra these days. It seems that the same sloppy coding that doesn't enable all the functions in software programs since the last update is responsible for a bunch of holes in the security of most everything. It's a good thing I did a complete backup last night so I can reinstall some previous version in case this update is just like the last one. Reply B. Jefferson Le Blanc  2017-05-15 23:39 Right. Backing up is good to do, or something like that. It should go without saying that heads-up TidBITS readers always back up before applying an update/upgrade, unfortunately that's not the case. Forewarned is forearmed, however. If you don't back up your system before one of these updates, any trouble you encounter is your own darn fault. Your negligence is not Apple's responsibility. Of course we'd like to know if you do run into trouble so we can know what to look out for. It's also good to know what's fixed. For instance, has Apple resolved any more of the issues with PDFKit? I would hope to hear about this from some TidBITS contributors who have reported on the problems with recent versions of the macOS and PDF documents. Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-16 10:26 What I'd really hope is that TidBITS readers would know to have a backup strategy that involves a constantly updated Time Machine backup, a nightly bootable duplicate, and an off-site backup done via CrashPlan or Backblaze. Then, no matter what, it's easy to restore even if things go south with an upgrade. :-) Reply nick304  2017-05-17 18:53 Totally agree about not knowing about PDFKit. This is the one thing which has totally stopped me from upgrading to Sierra, and I won't do so until I know for certain that the PDFKit problems have been resolved. It really frustrates me that Apple do not acknowledge the problems and address the status of the fixes in their release notes. I know they don't like admitting fault, but I depend on PDFs and need to know the OS is not going to screw them up - I can't afford the hassle of them being broken. Reply Jon Hall  2017-05-16 06:20 That list of changes is a sight for sore eyes. Long may they continue (and grow in substance)! Thank you, Apple! Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-24 17:05 I've now checked in with my sources, and the word on PDFKit changes in 10.12.5 is that there don't seem to be any. No one saw any fixes, either to older bugs or those introduced in 10.12.4. See http://tidbits.com/article/17152 Reply Duane  2017-05-24 18:57 Obviously others have had better results, but I've tried to install the latest Mac OS update, and the Mac won't complete the installation or boot. I had to boot from a Carbon Copy clone and copy it to the internal disk. I also tried using the recovery disk to do a complete system install, with the same result. I'd be glad if anyone can suggest a solution. Reply To leave a comment, click Add a Comment and then enter the text, your name, and your email address (which won't be displayed).

Apple has set a new premiere date for its Carpool Karaoke spinoff series after delaying the show's spring release.  The program is now set to debut Aug. 8 on streaming service Apple Music. Carpool Karaoke, which will expand the popular segment from CBS' The Late Late Show With James Corden into 16 half-hour episodes, will pair celebrities as they drive around town together. Corden is expected to appear in an episode but will not host the series, which instead will feature celebrity pairings including Shakira and Trevor Noah; Game of Thrones stars Sophie Turner and Maisie Williams; Queen Latifah and Jada Pinkett Smith; John Legend, Alicia Keys and Taraji P. Henson; and Miley, Noah, Billy Ray and the entire Cyrus family. Corden will be paired with Will Smith and LeBron James for separate installments. The series was first announced in July last year and was planned for a spring release. But in late April, Apple canceled a party tied to the show's premiere and a spokeswoman said that it would be released "later this year."  Produced by CBS Television Studios and Fulwell 73, the production company of Late Late Show executive producer Ben Winston, Carpool Karaoke is part of a original programming push at Apple, which has been looking for music-related series and specials to bulk up its Apple Music offering. The company is also planning the launch of Planet of the Apps, a competition series featuring mentors including Gwyneth Paltrow, Jessica Alba and Will.i.am. Apple had said that Planet would debut this spring, but has yet to announce a premiere date. Dr. Dre, who along with Jimmy Iovine sold headphone company Beats Electronics to Apple in 2014, also has a semi-autobiographical drama in the works with Apple, which has yet to confirm its plans for the project.  When Carpool Karaoke premieres, it will be made available to subscribers of Apple Music, which costs $10 per month. New episodes will be released every Tuesday.  FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Natalie Jarvey [email protected] NatJarv Comments comments powered by Disqus The Hollywood Reporter © 2017 The Hollywood Reporter All rights reserved.

Wall Street Daily Home Innovation GeoMacro Special Situations Contributors Free Reports Archives About Us Home Innovation GeoMacro Special Situations Contributors Free Reports Archives About Us WSD Team Contact Us Archives Ensure Email Delivery Frequently Asked Questions Broker Listing Investors Pull off the Impossible With Apple Shares Published Wed, May 31, 2017  |  Jonathan Rodriguez, Senior Analyst Low volatility spawns new opportunity. The impossible becomes a reality in one simple move. The best way to play Apple’s coming historic moment. Also recommended: Blue chip stocks get small-cap makeover. It’s getting tougher than ever to pay up for pricey stocks. As I write, the S&P 500 is trading at 19.7 forward earnings — just below a 10-year high. Of course, that’s not to say that bargains can’t be found in the market or that some stocks haven’t earned a premium valuation. But as senior analyst Jonathan Rodriguez pointed out last week, the lack of volatility in the stock market presents investors a unique opportunity. He revealed a little-known trading strategy that helps investors bypass lofty stock valuations and significantly increase their returns over stocks, too. Today, he’ll dive even deeper and show you exactly how to grab these gains… Ahead of the tape, Louis Basenese Chief Investment Strategist, Wall Street Daily Why Low Volatility Is Your Friend, Not Foe I’m sure you’re constantly hearing financial talking heads warning about the “dangers” of low market volatility (low vol). Granted, it’s true that investors should keep an eye on the force of market moves. But make no mistake, low vol offers far greater rewards than risks. One such reward is the stock replacement strategy. As you recall, this strategy uses long call options in place of stocks during periods of relative calm in the market. This strategy is incredibly useful for investors who want to cash in stock gains near a market top — but still want exposure to any potential upside. It’s also great for investors who want to forcefully multiply their returns on stock moves. Either way, now is the perfect time to implement the strategy. As I noted in last week’s column, there are two ways you can do it… An in-the-money (ITM) call option. (Current stock price is above the option’s strike price.) An out-of-the-money (OTM) call option. (Current stock price is below the option’s strike price.) Here’s what a stock replacement strategy might look like on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL), which is well on its way to becoming the first $1 trillion company in history. Technique #1: ITM call Donald Trump… The Best President EVER? They said Trump would only help the top 1%… But he’s already helping everyday Americans get rich. What you’re about to see could cement Trump’s legacy as the greatest president EVER. Click here to see what’s STUNNING liberals across the country. Right now, Apple is trading around $154. The stock trades at about 15 times forward earnings but also at a whopping 3.5 times forward sales. That’s a 78% premium to the S&P 500 and 14% above Apple’s five-year average. But thanks to low market volatility, options on the stock are reasonably priced — if not a little on the cheap side. A quick look at an options chain will show you that ITM calls are more valuable than those that are out of the money. Without getting into the weeds of option pricing, this is because ITM calls have intrinsic value. If you execute a call option that’s in the money and purchase the shares, you can immediately turn around and sell them for a profit. Calls that are out of the money require the underlying stock to rise above the strike price before a trader earns a profit on the shares. Now, you may recall that I drew your attention to an option’s “delta” last week. Put simply, delta is the correlation between the price of an option and the price of the underlying stock. The more valuable an option is, the higher its delta will be. Why is a high delta important for call options? Well, the higher an option’s delta, the more closely it tracks the underlying stock’s moves… Take a Bigger Bite out of Apple The Apple $120 calls expiring in January 2018 presently cost about $35. This means that one option (a contract to purchase 100 shares of stock) runs investors $3,500. Compare that with buying 100 shares of Apple outright, which would cost $15,400. So the option represents an $11,900 discount to owning shares and leverages investors more than four times to the stock’s gains. But where does delta come in? Well, the options boast a delta of 0.92. So every $1 move in Apple’s shares would generate a move of about $0.90 for the call options — a very tight correlation. These calls break even at expiration as long as the stock remains above $155 ($120 strike price + $35 option premium). That’s just slightly higher than the stock is trading right now. With a move in the underlying shares to $191 — a mere 24% gain — the option doubles in value. Better still, using a 50% stop loss on the trade risks just $1,750 of capital with the option. Using the same stop on the stock would deliver a loss of $7,700. Not a bad way to juice your upside on stocks and lower your risk at the same time. OK, let’s recap… The chief advantage of ITM calls over OTM options is that ITM calls benefit from a higher delta. Meaning that they earn more for every uptick in the underlying stock. The key downside is that ITM options are significantly more expensive than OTM calls. However, investors are well compensated with a much higher reward-to-risk ratio. Next week, we’ll break down OTM calls in more detail.

Reuters/Albert Gea With the Worldwide Developers Conference fast approaching, most are keeping their fingers crossed for the much-talked about release of an upgraded MacBook Pro. While most know that the refreshed notebook will most likely sport an Intel Kaby Lake chipset, it seems logical that an eventual MacBook Pro 2018 will come with a more powerful chipset. Coffee powered MacBook Pro in 2018? According to Apple Insider, the Cupertino company teased the potential release of a MacBook Pro 2018 backed by an Intel Coffee Lake SoC. This would be Intel’s 8th generation processor, pegged to be 30 percent faster than the current Intel Kaby Lake chipset.  Those should be angles worth looking into, though the amount of power in the Intel Coffee Lake chipsets comes a bit of a surprise. This is mainly because of the fact that Intel previously claimed that the next chips would offer performance improvement of only 15 percent.  Intel brands the Intel Coffee Lake as an optimisation of the current Intel Kaby Lake. They are targeting the second half of 2017 to release these new chips.  Going back to the fate of future MacBook Pros, the release date of the Intel Coffee Lake will be crucial. Most know that the Intel Skylake-backed MacBook Pro 2016 garnered disappointment. A lot of it had to do with the timing of the release of the Intel Kaby Lake chipset, something that only stabilised earlier this year.  The 16 GB RAM problem is back While the added power to a MacBook Pro 2018 should be something, there may be bumps ahead. The problem rekindles an issue tied to the MacBook Pro 2016 – the RAM.  In the event that the MacBook Pro 2018 comes with Intel Coffee Lake, it will not include support for LPDDR4. This means that such would allow quantities of memory to be used without requiring the use of a new RAM controller. Instead, it may be best for the MacBook Pro 2018 to consider using the Intel Cannon Lake. These are chipsets produced using a 10-nm process – something that offers a reduction in power usage. The only problem is that there is no certainty when these chips will be shipped.  For now, it would be best to focus on whether an upgraded MacBook Pro 2017 will be shown at the WWDC 2017 on June 5. A launch could hamper the regular schedule of the Cupertino company and may eventually dictate when to expect a MacBook Pro 2018.

By David Glance. Added by David Glance on 31 May 2017. Saved under In-depth, Top Tags: Apple, David Glance, Google, Qualcomm Tweet Apple is reportedly working on a chip called the Apple Neural Engine, which would be dedicated to carrying out artificial intelligence (AI) processing on its mobile devices. The addition of this type of capability would catalyse the use of AI on mobile devices. Although it is already being used extensively to power digital assistants like Siri and Google Assistant, these technologies rely on computer servers to process data sent to them rather than the processing happening on the mobile device itself. Augmented reality and digital assistants are not the only applications of AI that will become important on mobile devices. Once the capability is made available to all mobile application developers, it will bring new types of capabilities to mobile devices. Health applications, for example, will be able to tell when body readings from sensors on the phone or associated wearable devices are abnormal and need acting on. But the uses are potentially limitless and will bring about a new phase in how we rely on applications and our mobile devices in everyday life. And they will work, even when the device is not connected to the Internet. Strictly speaking, a specific processor is not an essential requirement for using AI on a mobile phone. Chip maker Qualcomm, for example, has provided a software-based approach, called the Snapdragon Neural Processing Engine, to allow developers using their chips to incorporate AI into their software. An example of this is a car that monitors the driver using a camera and warns when they are using their smartphone or driving erratically. Specific AI hardware, however, greatly speeds up the process called “machine learning” and allows for more sophisticated types of AI to be used. Google’s AI hardware, called the Tensor Processing Unit, is 15 to 30 times faster than the fastest computer processors (CPUs) and graphic processors (GPUs) that power computers today. These TPUs were what gave Google’s DeepMind its ability to beat the world champions of the Chinese game of Go. These TPUs also have vastly improved Google’s automated language translation software, Google Translate. The inclusion of AI in mobile software is going to massively increase the potential usefulness of that software and through that, how much we come to depend on the mobile phone. Our state of health, for example, is really about how we are doing relative to how we normally feel. Changes in behaviour can signal changes in mental health, including conditions like dementia and Parkinson’s. They can also be precursors of illnesses such as diabetes as well as respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. Our phones could monitor patterns of activity and even how we walk. This ability would be based on the software learning our normal patterns and once having detected a change, decide what to do about it. The phone would be part of a self-directed ecosystem of intelligent and autonomous machines, including cars. Not only is the driving of autonomous cars completely dependent on AI to function, it is likely that people will eventually share the use of these cars when needed, rather than owning one themselves. AI will again be essential for managing how this sharing functions to manage the most efficient distribution of cars, directing which cars need to pick up which clients. To do this, the scheduling AI service will need to liaise with AI software on everyone’s phones to determine where and when they will be at a given location and where they need to get to. AI on a mobile device will also increasingly be used to keep the device protected, checking if applications and communications are secure or likely to be a threat. This technology is already being implemented in smart home appliances, but as software. The addition of special AI chips will allow them to be much faster and to do more. Researchers are also looking at analysing the way we move as a means of uniquely identifying the wearer of a device. AI will essentially be able to fill in and apply the understanding and knowledge that not everyone possesses. Even if they do, remembering to do something, even when it is in your own best interest, is sometimes hard. There is a counterargument to the benefits of increasing the intelligence of mobile devices, however. This is the fear that as we come to rely on devices to do things, we will lose the ability to maintain that skill and that this will eventually impact on a person’s overall cognitive ability, or at least on their ability to operate without the AI. The successful outcome of having an AI assisting depends on the user following its advice, and this is something that people may not be that good at doing.

For the Android creator's vision for consumer devices to pan out, he needs to get tech giants and wireless carriers to reach a level of kumbaya. It's no easy feat. Phones by Richard Nieva 31 May 2017 6:26 am BST @richardjnieva Android creator Andy Rubin shows off his newest creation: The Essential phone Asa Mathat/Vox Media Android creator Andy Rubin early Tuesday unveiled his vision for the future of consumer devices: Phones with software that's not consumed with bloatware or extra features from carriers like AT&T or Verizon. Devices in your home that all connect and communicate with each other, regardless of whether they're made by Apple or Samsung or Google. His new company has an equally audacious name: Essential. But how can he succeed where so many others have failed -- to make his brand pro-consumer in a way that makes all the other tech and wireless giants play nicely? For now, his answer isn't very specific.  "I'm trying as hard as I can," Rubin said Tuesday evening at Recode's Code Conference in Rancho Palos Verdes, California. He was answering a question about preventing carriers from adding bloatware -- extra apps from handset makers and carriers -- to your phone. Earlier in the day, Rubin gave us our first glimpse at Essential. So far there are two main products: A high-end titanium phone with attachable components, like a 360-degree camera. The second is a smart home hub called Home, which competes with the Amazon Alexa and Google Home. Other devices are expected in the future. During the Code Conference interview, Rubin said the goal for his smart home devices is to create an open ecosystem that supports different standards and protocols. To do that, he's created a new operating system called Ambient OS, though details about it are still scant. The hope is for Home to support the digital assistants from all the various tech titans: Amazon's Alexa, Google's Assistant, Apple's Siri -- not to mention a new assistant from Essential. There's a "trick" to that, he said, by plugging into those companies' developer tools, which allow app makers to build for those ecosystems. Still, getting a company like Apple to open up its platform is no easy feat. "I'm going to offer to support all those," he said. "And it's really up to the companies that support all those ecosystems if they want to work with me." Representatives from Apple, Google and Amazon didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. The uncertainty over being able to work with big tech companies underscores just how hard it is to make a dent in the consumer electronics market. Newcomers have to navigate a space occupied by powerful tech giants with can have tight control over how their devices work with other products. "Everybody's creating an island by creating their own ecosystem," Rubin said. "Building bridges is the best way to describe what we're doing with the Home device." For Rubin, Essential is a test to see if he can make lightning strike again. As the creator of Android, he brought the smartphone to the masses. In 2005, he sold the startup to Google for $50 million and shepherded it to the most dominant mobile software in the world. Android now runs on 2 billion devices and almost nine out of every 10 smartphones shipped on the planet runs Android. Rubin left Google in 2014, where he had most recently been running the company's nascent robotics division. His followup act was Playground Global, a tech incubator -- techspeak for a company that nurtures young startups -- that specifically helps firms creating hardware products. Essential itself is one of Playground's portfolio companies. On Tuesday evening, Rubin showed off the Essential devices for the first time publicly. He also gave a few other tidbits about devices. The attachments connect through magnetics and wireless USB, and they attach in a way that if Essential radically changes the physical design of the phone, the attachments would still be usable. For now, he's said he's selling the devices on Essential's website but later will get distribution through carriers and other retailers. But he still doesn't have many specifics on how he'll get the tech giants and carriers to get on a kumbaya level. What he will say, though, is that he doesn't want Essential to be just a niche brand. "We're going for it," he said. "We're swinging for the fences." It's Complicated: This is dating in the age of apps. Having fun yet? These stories get to the heart of the matter.

Here's how it compares against Apple iPhone 7 Plus and Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus, which are the top-end smartphones Written by Shruti Dhapola | New Delhi | Updated: May 31, 2017 12:57 pm Andy Rubin’s Essential smartphone is a premium one with a Titanium body, an edge-to-edge bezel-less display, and the option of adding a 360-degree camera. Related News Apple to launch new MacBook Pro next week, official announcement to be made at WWDC 2017 India’s tablet market declines by 18 per cent on an yearly basis: IDC Samsung Notebook 9 Pro with Windows 10, embedded S Pen launched at Computex Android’s co-creator Andy Rubin is back with a new smartphone called Essential. The Essential smartphone sports a premium design and look, and a price tag of $699. While Rubin’s blog post says they want to offer “premium materials and true craftsmanship,” and this should not be limited to a few people, the pricing of this phone clearly puts it in the league of the top-end smartphones of the world. The Essential smartphone is a premium device with a Titanium body, an edge-to-edge bezel-less display, and the option of adding a 360-degree camera that will just snap onto the phone. How does the Essential smartphone stand against the two premium smartphones in the market, namely the Apple iPhone 7 Plus and Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus? Here’s a quick look at the detailed features. Essential PH-1 vs Apple iPhone 7 Plus vs Samsung Galaxy S8+: Display, Design  Now when it comes to display and design, Essential PH-1 smartphone has something new on the cards. Essential PH-1 smartphone sports a 5.71-inch full edge-to-edge display with “radiused corners,” and a resolution of 2560 x 1312 pixels, which is QHD and the aspect ratio is 19:10. This has a brightness of 500 nits. Dimensions of the Essential smartphone are 141.5 mm (5.57-inches) x 71.1mm (2.79-inches) x 7.8mm (0.3-inches). Despite the big display, the phone is only 5.5-inches in size, thanks to the bezel-less screen. Essential PH-1 also doesn’t come with any case, because the company is so confident of the design. The other interesting bit on the Essential PH-1 smartphone is that it sports a ‘Titanium’ body and not the regular aluminium body we see on devices like Apple’s iPhone 7 Plus, or an all glass and metal one like the Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus. Essential PH-1 also doesn’t come with any case, because the company is so confident of the design. Oh, and there’s Corning Gorilla Glass 5 on top of the display.  Essential also has a “Click cordless connector” for wireless charging your phone, but this will have to be purchased separately and is not on sale yet. Also, the Essential smartphone doesn’t have a headphone jack just like the Apple iPhone 7 series, but the company is providing for a Headphone Adapter (Type C to 3.5mm) in the box. The phone doesn’t have water or dust resistance support like the Apple iPhone 7 Plus or Samsung Galaxy S8+ either. The fingerprint scanner is placed at the back, and there’s no home button on the front of this phone. Samsung Galaxy S8, S8+ also come with an Iris Scanner and Face Recognition feature for unlocking and the ‘Infinity Display.’ Samsung’s new Galaxy S8+ along with the Galaxy S8 come with an ‘Infinity Display’. There are no bezels on the side, but the phone has bezels on the top and bottom. Samsung has done away with the home button on the front, and placed the fingerprint scanner the back of the phone, right next to the camera module. However, this placement hasn’t found so much approval. Samsung Galaxy S8, S8+ also come with an Iris Scanner and Face Recognition feature for unlocking. In terms of specifications, Samsung Galaxy S8, S8+ have much bigger displays at 5.8-inch and 6.2-inch respectively, but again the the bezel-less sides means the overall body size has not increase drastically. Both are 2K SAMOLED screens. The S8’s dimensions are 148.9 x 68.1 x 8.0 mm and while the Samsung Galaxy S8+ has 159.5mm x 73.4 x 8.1mm dimensions. Samsung Galaxy S8+ also has IP68 rating, which means it is water and dust-resistant. The Galaxy S8+ still has a headphone jack for those who care, and the familiar glass and metal design, which does make this phone a bit more fragile. Apple iPhone 7 Plus comes with a 5.5-inch full HD resolution display, and there’s a Jet Black colour option as well. Apple iPhone 7 Plus sports the following dimensions: 158.2 mm x 77.9 mm x 7.3 mm, and comes with an aluminium chassis. Apple iPhone 7 Plus comes with a 5.5-inch full HD resolution display, and there’s a Jet Black colour option as well. The iPhone doesn’t have a headphone jack, and there’s no space for a microSD slot either. However, Apple iPhone 7 Plus comes with IP68 water and dust resistance. But with Apple iPhone 8, we could see the company introduce a bezel-less display just like these phones, though it will go for a glass design. Essential PH-1 vs Apple iPhone 7 Plus vs Samsung Galaxy S8+: Specifications, Battery Essential PH-1 smartphone runs the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor coupled with 4GB  RAM+ 128GB storage. There’s no microSD slot either. Essential PH-1 smartphone has a 3040 mAh battery with fast-charging support via USB-Type C as well as support for wireless charging. The phone also has a magnetic connector with wireless data transfer feature. Essential PH-1 smartphone runs the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor coupled with 4GB  RAM+ 128GB storage. In the US, Samsung Galaxy S8+ runs the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor, but in India this has the  Exynos 8895 processor. Galaxy S8 series comes with 4GB RAM and 64GB storage, which is expandable to 256GB via microSD. Samsung Galaxy S8+ comes with 3400 mAh battery, wireless charging support and fast charging supported. Apple iPhone 7 Plus comes with A10 chip from the company, which is a quad-core one, and has three storage options: 32GB, 128GB and 256GB. Apple iPhone 7 Plus has 3GB RAM, but there’s no support for a microSD card.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Site Archive UPDATE: Super Target shooting suspect shot by deputies Tuesday Tuesday May 30, 2017 at 12:01 AM May 31, 2017 at 9:50 AM Paola Baker Staff Writer @DP_PaolaBaker APPLE VALLEY — The man believed to be responsible for a shooting at Super Target on Memorial Day was shot and wounded by authorities Tuesday. Dearld Edward Wicker, 41, of Apple Valley, was transported to a trauma center with gunshot wounds during an incident with San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department deputies at a home in the 25000 block of Flathead Road on Tuesday evening. Wicker is accused of shooting a man in the head during an argument in the parking lot of the Super Target at 20288 Highway 18 on Monday evening. He fled the scene in a black Ford Bronco, officials said, and remained at large until Tuesday evening, when officials tracked him down to the home on Flathead Road. Sheriff's spokeswoman Cindy Bachman said deputies were in the area “conducting a follow-up” related to the Super Target shooting when they arrived to the home on Flathead Road at 6:08 p.m. Tuesday. Wicker had been identified as the suspect, officials said, and a warrant was issued for his arrest. “Upon arriving at the location, deputies made contact with Wicker, who was armed with a handgun, and a deputy-involved shooting occurred,” officials said in a statement. Apple Valley Fire Protection District Fire Chief Sid Hultquist said an AVFPD paramedic engine company was requested to respond to a call about a possible shooting victim at the location. The victim had “multiple gunshot wounds”, Hultquist said, and was taken to St. Joseph Health, St. Mary before being airlifted to Loma Linda University Medical Center for treatment. Bachman said it appeared only one deputy was involved in the incident. He was uninjured in the incident, Bachman said, and no other injuries were reported. Homicide detectives were requested to respond and are currently conducting the investigation. Authorities did not provide any additional information late Tuesday. The investigation is ongoing, and anyone with information is urged to contact Sheriff’s Homicide Detail, Detective Lisa Guerra at 909-387-3589.

Rumours suggest phones could come bundled with Apple Airpods (RRP £159) By Daniel Nissenbaum 31 May 2017 Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share by email Claims that Apple will include a pair of its wireless Airpod headphones in the box with the iPhone 8 have been circulating online in recent weeks. The Airpods, released last December, are specifically designed to integrate with iPhones. Apple is expected to launch the next incarnation of its iPhone in September. As usual, speculation is rife around possible new features, but one rumour, based on an investment analysis by bank JP Morgan, suggests that Apple could be preparing to raise prices for the iPhone range while including the headphones to sweeten the deal. The claims should be taken with a pinch of salt – online commentators have cast doubt on the logic behind Apple trying to shift millions of extra pairs of Airpods when there are already six-week waiting times for customers who want to buy one. The report also predicts that Apple will release upgraded versions of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, named the 7s and 7s Plus, alongside an all-new model that will be called the iPhone 8. Read our review of the Airpods to see what we thought of them when we tested them in the lab. Headphone reviews – find out how the Airpods compare to all the models we’ve tested What are the Airpods? The Airpods are Apple’s first official wireless headphones. They were announced alongside the iPhone 7 last year, which famously ditched the 3.5mm headphone socket, leaving users the choice between connecting via the Lightning port or going wireless. Supply issues meant that the Airpods weren’t actually released until three months after the iPhone 7, but they are designed to work together. The headphones are touch sensitive – a double tap on an ear bud will activate the Siri voice assistant on the phone, allowing you to control your phone without it ever leaving your pocket. Initially, the Airpods were the subject of some mockery due to their unusual design – the two ear buds aren’t connected by any kind of cable at all, meaning they dangle oddly out of the ears. Other criticisms were directed at their short battery life. The ear buds will only last for three hours on their own, but they do come supplied with a case that doubles as a charger. Despite these doubts, the Airpods have sold well and early adopters seem to be impressed. A recent survey by Creative Strategies, a US market research firm, suggests that initial satisfaction levels are even higher for the Airpods than they were for other major Apple products, such as the iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch. Other options for iPhone 7 users IPhone 7 owners aren’t able to use standard wired headphones without a Lightning cable adaptor (supplied with the phone). Features such as in-line microphones and volume controls should still work through the adaptor if they were compatible with older iPhone models. A small minority of headphones are designed to use the Lightning port on the iPhone. As the Lightning connection is capable of transferring power to the headphones, these models can include features such as noise cancelling without the need for a battery. If you’re looking for some headphones to pair with your iPhone, we’ve rounded up our top picks in our iPhone headphones advice guide.

Gaming News PS4 Xbox One Nintendo PC Gaming Mobile Gaming What’s Hot Rumour Gameplay Guide Patch Tech News Mobile Tablet Desktop OS Tech Rumors Trending Anime Movies TV Series Entertainment Sports Social Media World News Contact Us The Bitbag Gaming News PS4 Xbox One Nintendo PC Gaming Mobile Gaming What’s Hot Rumors Gameplay Guide Patch Tech News Mobile Tablet Desktop OS Tech Rumors Trending Anime Movies TV Series Entertainment Sports Social Media World News Reviews Shop OS iOS 11 Release To Exclude iPhone 5, 4th-Gen iPad & More – List of Supported Devices HERE By Necta Casiple on May 31, 2017 11:35 AM iOS users can expect tons of updates when iOS 11 launches at the Worldwide Developer’s Conference next week. Apple has always been good at keeping its older products updated, so we guess it’ll still try to make most devices suitable for the newest version. However, sooner or later, some of them just get too old, making them less of a candidate for the rollout. While the tech giant maintains a strong backward-compatibility with its device lineup, there have been indications that it is dropping support for 32-bit apps altogether with iOS 11. Starting with iOS 10.3, Apple has begun notifying users when they open a 32-bit app on iOS. The alert says the app must be updated by the developer or else it may no longer work with future versions of iOS. That could mean the end of support for 32-bit devices too, which suggests the iPhone 5 and fourth-generation iPad won’t be compatible with iOS 11. (…and it sounds like future A-series chips won’t even include 32-bit support. Wonder if that’ll free up any performance/die space?) — Steve T-S (@stroughtonsmith) April 8, 2017 According to reports, iPhone 5c and iPhone 5s could also lose iOS compatibility this year. Since Apple has discontinued the iPad mini 2 and iPad mini 3, these tablets could be chopped too. However, these four retired devices are less likely to lose support than the first two mentioned above. Other retired handsets with iOS 10 compatibility, including the iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPad Air, and iPad Air 2, should all be compatible with iOS 11, alongside the current models on the market. AppDevice When is the iOS 11 release? The new OS should be shown off during Apple’s June 5 keynote. However, it won’t likely be fully released until the fall. The Cupertino-based company usually debuts the new version of iOS on or around the time it launches a new model of the iPhone. If it follows the same pattern this year, that’ll be sometime in September. There have been rumors of a possible iPhone 8 delay due to production issues, but it seems unlikely that the final iOS 11 release date would be pushed back also. What are the expected iOS 11 features? Apple always kees its cards close to its vest when it comes to software, but here are a few possibilities: Siri updates – Apple is said to pump up Siri‘s ability to communicate more naturally. In combination with the company’s heavy investments in machine learning, this could make its voice assistant more powerful than ever, able to handle complex queries in a single bound. Apple Music with video – According to Bloomberg, Apple executive Jimmy Iovine said that a version of Apple Music that “better showcases video” would be among the features of the iOS 11. Group Facetime – This is a new group chat feature, similar to Hangouts and Skype, that should be coming to FaceTime. The update will allow multiple users to join a single call; which has been the app’s most obvious missing feature. Dark Mode – Dark or Night mode changes native apps from their stark white background to something a lot darker to help with nighttime visibility. Maps improvements – Rumors have it that the company will begin using drones and indoor navigation technology to improve its still flailing Maps app. The drones would reportedly be utilized to offer up more reliable data in the app– something it still desperately needs. Person-to-person Apple Pay – One feature has been missing from the Apple Pay since its launch last year: the ability to easily send payments between users of Apple devices, so a money-swapping feature might be in the offing for this year.

The Worldwide Developers Conference event to be held in San Jose, CA on June 5 is said to the be venue for the announcement. While this may sound exciting to Apple fans, perhaps looking at what the future might bring for the MacBook 2018 might give them some more enjoyment. Intel just announced yesterday at the Computex 2017 event in Taiwan that is has successfully tested its latest processor architecture. The company registered a 30-percent performance improvement on its Coffee Lake processors. This performance boost, compared to the current Kaby Lake lineup is quite impressive in the scheme of things. In addition to announcing the said performance gains, Intel also said that it will make the Coffee Lake processors available in the market as early as the second half of 2017. MacBook lineup (via engadget.com) This could mean that MacBook 2018 releases will be able to take advantage of the new processors’ performance gains. This and longer battery life due to the improved efficiency of the new processors. At the moment, the current MacBook laptops are still on older Intel processors, mostly with Skylake architecture. Many consumers expected Apple to release the MacBook Pro on Kaby Lake processors. Unfortunately, the availability made it impossible at the time. This is why Apple is reported to be planning a release of Kaby Lake-powered MacBook laptops next month. Having an updated MacBook 2018 release is a welcomed change especially for hardcore Mac fans. For now, it is still too soon to tell whether Intel will be able to deliver its promise for the Coffee Lake processors. Last year, the company experienced some major delays in the release of the Kaby Lake processors that inevitably affected the MacBook Pro. For more updates on the MacBook 2018, be sure to check us out at TheBitbag.

Willhans Ili was appointed to the City Council in 2010 and was elected to a full term in 2011. He was unsuccessful in his bid for re-election in 2015, when now-Mayor Gloria Olmos was elected to the council. An audit of the city’s financial controls from 2013 to 2015 released last week by State Controller Betty Yee’s office showed former City Manager Anthony Ybarra and a handful of City Council members used credit cards to pay for extended hotel stays, bar tabs and expensive electronics. Ili was found to have used his card to pay for a $50 bar tab and $2,592.77 on a MacBook Pro laptop, Apple TV and accessories. In an interview Tuesday, Ili said although the audit described it as a “bar tab,” the $50 charge was for a meal at the Aria Hotel in Las Vegas, within his per diem allowance. The tab did not include alcohol. Ili said he and other council members were at the hotel for a National Association of Latino Democratic Officials conference. He also said the Apple purchases were scheduled upgrades for his city-issued laptop and iPad, which had become outdated. The Apple TV allowed him to display items from his laptop, iPad or iPhone to TV screens. He said the purchase was not for personal use. Ili said he returned the Apple electronics to the city, and provided a memo sent from interim City Manager Jennifer Vasquez requesting their return. The memo didn’t say when the items were returned. He said he believed the State Auditor’s staff was not presented enough information when they reviewed the city credit card records. “I don’t think the city kept good enough records about the purposes for charges,” Ili said. “I just think they could’ve used more information.” Also referenced in the audit were current council members Hector Delgado and Angelica Garcia. Like Ili, both were found to have made purchases of Apple products. Delgado was also found to have charged a stay at the Aria in Las Vegas for the same conference Ili attended. However, interim Vasquez disputed that Delgado made the purchase. Advertisement City Councilman Joseph Gonzales said the behavior of the city’s leaders was unacceptable. “I’m glad the State Controller’s Office looked into the credit card charges along with everything else they examined,” Gonzales said. “When I first asked them to come audit the city, we weren’t even thinking about the credit cards, but now it’s easy to see that they were handled with little oversight.” Olmos said though he was referenced in the audit, Ili would still be considered for appointment to the City Council just like all of the other candidates. But she said the audit backed up why she wouldn’t support any former city council members or mayors for the spot. “It would be a slap in the face to the voters who voted them out,” Olmos said. “People voted them out for a reason. Who am I to bring them back in?” Following the audit, Ili said he intended to remain a candidate for the vacant spot on the council. Released Thursday, the audit detailed lax oversight in South El Monte that, in addition to the abuse of credit cards, led to hundreds of thousands of dollars in spending on consulting contracts. “South El Monte officials demonstrated a culture of incompetence and blatant disregard for accountability of taxpayer dollars,” Yee said in a statement. “I am especially concerned with their exorbitant lobbying and consulting expenses that resulted in undefined benefits to the city and its residents.” Contractors hired by the city have been under scrutiny since a June 2016 audit that uncovered similar issues. That audit, conducted by a firm hired by the city, found Ybarra executed contracts with two consulting firms that never went before the council. The auditors further found that those contractors didn’t keep records of their work. The conclusion of the report was that the city left itself an easy target for fraud. One of the candidates for the vacancy Wednesday will fill the spot left by former Mayor Luis Aguinaga, who resigned in 2016. Aguinaga was the subject of a years-long FBI investigation that found he took tens of thousands of dollars in bribes from a city contractor over seven years. Aguinaga was sentenced to one year in jail in April. In addition to Ili, here’s the entire list of applicants for appointment to the City Council: • Valle Lindo School District board member Richard Angel • City Planning Commissioner Leonel Barrera, Jr. • City Patriotic Commissioner Francisco Duarte • Resident Arnold Martinez • Former City Councilman Raul Pardo • City Community Services Commissioner Gracie Retamoza • Mountain View School District board member Veronica Sifuentes • Former City Council candidate Gil Zepeda Click here to subscribe to Digital & Home Delivery - 50% off About the Author Christopher Yee is a staff writer for the San Gabriel Valley Tribune.

But the company's ability to do high volume, value-added manufacturing at a reasonable cost may cushion it from any potential slowdown in demand for iPhones in the long term, a JPMorgan analyst told CNBC. It is expected to assemble the bulk of Apple's newest smartphones due later this year, and may benefit from a supercycle. "Hon Hai, at the end of the day, is a process company," said Gokul Hariharan, Asia tech analyst and head of Taiwan equity research at JPMorgan. "If you look at the history of Hon Hai over the last 20 years, product cycle has not really mattered as much." Sean Gallup | Getty Images He explained the company has always tried to run a vertically integrated business model, where it started with connectors and other components business before going into assembly in mid-to-late 90s. First Hon Hai assembled desktops when they were still the main tech product; then it moved into game consoles, feature phones with Motorola and Nokia, and music players for Apple before moving onto smartphones. "So all along, the skill set they're providing is high volume manufacturing at a very reasonable cost and very strong execution," Hariharan said, adding the manufacturer also brings in a fair bit of technology elements into its offering. "Which is why it feels like it may not be very directly linked to product cycles in the long term." Along the way, Hon Hai added some components businesses to their operations in an attempt to maximize the value, in terms of dollar content, within any product they assemble, according to Hariharan. Last year's acquisition of troubled Japanese electronics maker Sharp meant Hon Hai now had access to two major components of a smartphone: camera modules and display. These two functionalities are usually expected to be upgraded by smartphone vendors, even when other features of handsets may remain the same. "If you look at most tech products, display is typically one of the largest cost items in terms of components," Hariharan said. Japanese business daily Nikkei reported in January that Hon Hai and Sharp were mulling over building a factory in China — where the iPhones are assembled — to make OLED display panels. The proximity could theoretically reduce components cost for making the iPhone. The next generation of iPhones are expected to come with OLED display and currently Samsung Display will provide the bulk of these panels for Apple. show chapters Cramer: iPhone 8 cycle will be a big one    Monday, 22 May 2017 | 9:16 AM ET | 01:49 Reuters reported that Hon Hai and Sharp have teamed up to bid for Toshiba's prized memory chip business. Hariharan said a potential move into the semiconductor business was underpinned by the fact that Hon Hai made close to 20 to 25 percent in revenue from enterprise and cloud; the company assembles servers, storage elements and switches for tech companies and enterprise is a big driver for NAND flash, he added. The other two major contract electronics manufacturers that assemble iPhones — Pegatron and Wistron — also remain exposed to Apple, at least in the short term. Wistron is a latecomer to the assembly equation and handles mostly the older iPhones. Hariharan said JPMorgan has a conservative view on Wistron because the company is still making the transition from producing lower-end handsets to the most advanced; it needs to build up capacity to handle the high volume seen in the first quarter of new iPhone launches, where Apple can sell more than 10 million units on the opening weekend. "If you're not a vendor who is able to support that volume ramp in that period, then you never get peak volume for your capacity," he said. Meanwhile, some of Apple's more specialized suppliers — who provide components such as camera modules — remain well-hedged in their business because they serve the global smartphone market — meaning, they were also selling into other smartphone brands. For example Samsung or SK Hynix supply memory to majority of the smartphone brands. "They don't have the same level of cyclicality," said Hariharan, but they don't enjoy the same benefits from a surge in demand for iPhones. "They won't have the same upside when you have a very strong iPhone cycle, in terms of their revenues and profits." show chapters Apple, Samsung lose market share to Chinese phone makers    Tuesday, 23 May 2017 | 4:25 PM ET | 01:03 For the moment, Hariharan expects the dynamics between Apple and its suppliers to remain in the short term: this means iPhone assemblers like Hon Hai, Pegatron and Wistron will stay exposed to the iPhone product cycle and their revenues will swing accordingly. But in the longer term, if smartphones are replaced by something bigger, Hariharan said a company with a vertically integrated business model such as Hon Hai could be the partner of choice to assemble it. JPMorgan's price target for Hon Hai by year-end is NT$112 ($3.72). On Wednesday morning at 10:40 a.m. HK/SIN, Hon Hai shares traded at NT$104.

Between 2006 and 2009, Apple ran a series of ads targeting the main competitor of the company at the time: Microsoft.   Eight years later and things are very different – the opposition has changed, and the stadium has moved. Mobile internet browsing overtook the desktop for the first time last year, and that’s a crossover point to which there’s no coming back from. In the mobile space, there’s only one rival worth worrying about, and it sure as hell isn’t Microsoft. The full statistics from quarter four last year are hidden behind that link, but to save you a click, Android had 81.7% of the market, followed by iOS on 17.9%. The remaining 0.4% was divided between Windows, “Other” and BlackBerry – the latter of which had a marketshare so small it could be rounded down to 0.0%. So it’s no surprise that Apple’s latest campaign is targeted at the rival with a marketshare worth eating away at. To that end, the company has launched a section of their site dedicated to switching to iPhone, which covers topics such as ease of use, the camera, sustainability, speed and customer satisfaction. Android is namechecked just twice in the page, though given the webpage’s title tag reads “Switch from Android to iPhone – Apple,” I think we can be pretty confident as to who they have in mind. Still, perhaps Apple’s marketing department regarded that as a bit too subtle, because they’ve now launched three new 16-second adverts on the company YouTube channel, and two of them take a pretty direct swipe at perceived weaknesses in the Android armour. First up: security. Next, Apple targets the kind of choppiness you can get on low-end Android phones (a little harsh, given that’s down to phone specifications rather than the OS itself, but that’s advertising for you): Finally, Apple provides a visual demonstration of how easy it can be to relocate all your contacts to their new home: If you’re thinking all of these are a touch underwhelming, I agree with you.  Related Articles Apple and Microsoft go head to head - again Microsoft tops Apple in tablet satisfaction survey Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, Google and more rally against Trump's travel ban In the game of warranty roulette, you either win, or you lose...

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Wednesday, 31 May 2017 | MYT 11:00 AM Apple poised to take on streaming biz as services segment flourishes by jan dawson A little more than 80% of Apple's total revenues over the past year have come from hardware sales, with iPhones accounting for nearly two-thirds of the total and iPads and Macs another 20%. But Apple's Services segment generated around 13% of the total. — Bloomberg LOS ANGELES: The vast majority of Apple's revenue still comes from iPhones, Macs, iPads and other hardware. But its Services business has become its fastest-growing segment – and hidden within that unit is a content business that's growing tremendously.  A little more than 80% of Apple's total revenues over the past year have come from hardware sales, with iPhones accounting for nearly two-thirds of the total and iPads and Macs another 20%. But Apple's Services segment generated around 13% of the total.  The segment includes iTunes, iBooks and the App Store as well as revenues from Apple Music, Apple Pay and money Google sends to Apple for featuring its search engine in its Safari browser. It's become the fastest-growing part of Apple's business, averaging 20% growth year on year even as Apple's iPhone business has shrunk a little.  The Services business has become so important to Apple that the company has set a formal target of doubling revenues from the segment between 2016 and 2020. But the segment is also something of a black box, containing many different parts of Apple's business across a range of areas, none of which Apple breaks out explicitly.  Yet it's possible to arrive at some pretty decent estimates of the size of the constituent parts and, specifically, to break out the content business. That business generated about US$15bil (RM64.21bil) in net revenue for Apple in 2016 – around 7% of its total revenues.  If we look at Apple's gross take from its content business, the number is even more impressive. On that basis, revenue was nearly US$8bil (RM34.25bil) in the March 2017 quarter, and the scale of the content business is approaching that of some of the largest congloms.  That quarterly revenue number was roughly double CBS' quarterly income; it was about the size of total 21st Century Fox revenues toward the end of last year; and it eclipsed NBCUniversal business (minus theme parks). The only major content businesses bigger were Time Warner's and Disney's. And Apple is rapidly closing in on Time Warner.  This scale and rapid rate of growth make Apple's content business unique among its peers, and that puts it in a powerful position to invest, even in original content. We're seeing the start of that effort with a series of acquisitions for videos to play in Apple Music, including a series from The Late Late Show host James Corden. But Apple could easily increase that spending if it becomes serious about a standalone subscription video offering.  So far, the company isn't trying to compete directly with Netflix, which it sees as a partner and a customer. But there's no financial reason why Apple couldn't begin to challenge not just Netflix but Amazon, HBO, Hulu and any number of other players that invest in original content. — Reuters Related Stories You May Be Interested Apple poised to take on streaming biz as services segment flourishes Four instant cameras for snap ‘n’ share summer fun Rocket Internet prepares for profit from startups by year-end Layoffs rile India’s flagship IT sector 5 ways to avoid dehydration during Ramadan Racing for a better tomorrow Others Also Read More US tourists coming to our shores soon Sports therapist Ronald Fauvel passes away Rangers sign Portuguese defender Alves on two-year deal advertisement Latest News Africans never hung up on Nokia's old brick China puts into effect new drone registration rules Parents have no right to dead child's Facebook account As China ushers in new cyber law, misgivings remain Sears says some Kmart customer credit card numbers compromised Most Viewed in Tech Parents have no right to dead child's Facebook account How good are budget notebooks really?

Club MacStoriesWeekly Extras MENU ABOUT PODCAST NEWSLETTER ADVERTISE SECTIONS APP REVIEWS IPAD DIARIES STORIES APPLE HISTORY IOS AUTOMATION GAMES Readdle Brings Split View Drag & Drop to Their iPad Apps iOS 11: iPad Wishes and Concept Video Things 3: Beauty and Delight in a Task Manager This week's sponsor Trails Your GPS Tracker and Logbook for iPhone & Apple Watch More Than Stickers: Exploring iMessage App Utilities By Ryan Christoffel It has been nearly a full year since Craig Federighi introduced the iMessage App Store to developers at WWDC. Coming out of that keynote, it was easy to guess that sticker packs might become a hit with users, but the big unknown surrounded the idea of more powerful iMessage apps. Would anyone actually want to use iMessage for anything more than basic messaging? The challenge with creating a great iMessage app is similar in ways to that of creating a great Apple Watch app. In most cases it requires taking an existing app and stripping functionality down to its simplest form, while still retaining the overall usefulness and power of the full app. And as is true with Watch apps, some iMessage apps tackle the challenge well, while others fail to be useful due to slow or overcomplicated interfaces. The first year of the iMessage App Store has been dominated by stickers, but amidst the crazy sharks and flaming pizza, there are a number of interesting and creative apps serving as helpful utilities as well. I have tried out iMessage apps for ordering food, managing files, sharing calendars, sending payments, planning meetings, and more. What follows is a list of some of my favorites. Unitrans: Unitrans is an iMessage-only app that translates your words, using a variety of language options, so you can send intelligible messages in a language that's foreign to you. It's a free download, but after you try it, the $1.99 In-App Purchase is a must. With the IAP the app will remember the default language for each conversation so you only have to select it once. Without the IAP, you'll have to manually set the correct language every time you use Unitrans, which is a terrible experience because the interface for selecting a language is painfully slow. Depending on the language you need, you have to tap the down arrow countless times to find it. The IAP limits that experience to the first time you message someone new with Unitrans, so I highly recommend it. Once you get the app set up, it is remarkably simple to use, and makes a perfect fit for iMessage. Starbucks: Although some food and drink-focused iMessage apps allow you to place a group order from within Messages, Starbucks went a simpler route. The one function of the app is sending digital Starbucks gift cards to friends – a task accomplished with ease using Apple Pay. Opening the app presents a number of gift card design options, with themes related to birthdays, congratulations, graduations, and more. Tap on the design you'd like to send, and you can choose from three amount options: $5, $10, and $25. Next you just have to hit a 'Buy' button, scan your fingerprint to authorize Apple Pay, and the gift is ready to send away. Starbucks has really nailed the presentation and ease of use here, making this app a great option when you want to surprise someone with a gift. Fandango: Fandango has packed the full ticket-purchasing experience into its iMessage app, and it works quite well. Upon opening the app, you're greeted with an assortment of movie posters that represent the top films currently showing in your area. If you don't see what you're looking for, there's a search option as well. With a movie selected, you'll see all of its showings at theaters nearby, and after selecting a showtime you're presented with two options: Buy or Send Info. The former walks you through the remainder of the purchasing process, including things like seat selection if your theater has reserved seats. Everything can be completed directly from Messages, then those tickets can be sent to your friends. If you're not ready to buy yet, you can hit Send Info to create a rich media card that can be sent to your friends. This card includes imagery from the film, the rating, running length, Rotten Tomatoes score, and the details of the showing you selected. The recipient, upon tapping this card, can hit the 'Let's Go' button or suggest a different showtime. Venmo and Square Cash: Each of these services for sending and receiving money is built around simplicity; once you have an account setup, using Venmo or Square Cash is quick and easy. It makes sense, then, that each service would work well in iMessage. Venmo has the edge, as its iMessage app allows both sending and requesting payment, whereas Square Cash only permits the former. Rumors indicate that Apple is working on a peer-to-peer payment expansion of Apple Pay, which may prove an even simpler alternative to these options. For now though, sending and receiving money doesn't get much easier than these iMessage apps. Who's In: Microsoft introduced Who's In last month as an easy way to plan outings with friends. When playing the role of event planner, you can use the app to browse restaurants, movie showtimes, or nearby attractions. Once you've found what you're looking for, making that selection will then prompt you for the date and time of the outing. Those details are sent to your friends in a rich card interface that looks great. When they receive your message, tapping the card will allow them to vote on if they're in for the plans or not. The ease of responding to a proposed event makes Who's In a clever, streamlined method of event planning. Pocket: Pocket is one of the premier read-later services available today, and its iMessage app is the best way to share articles from the service through Messages. Opening the app will present a list of recent articles saved to My List. If the article you're looking for isn't there, you can use the search box to find articles both from My List and from your Archive. Selecting an article shares its native link containing a featured image, title, and link source. Alternately, if you instead share from the main Pocket app using the share sheet, what you'll share is a Pocket-specific link that results in what you see at the top of the screenshot on the right – a pocket.co link is complemented by a second message bubble containing the page's title in plain text. The iMessage app's output, seen in the bottom half of the same screenshot, is easily the superior presentation. Dropbox and OneDrive: Both of these apps let you share files by browsing your full folder hierarchy within Messages; Dropbox has a slight edge in the field of navigation as it includes a search option, which OneDrive does not. But the way file sharing is handled is fundamentally different between Dropbox and OneDrive. When you send a Dropbox file, what you're really sharing is a file link. This allows recipients to view and download the file in question without needing to do anything extra like download an app. OneDrive opts for a different sharing route; in order to open a sent file, recipients need to have the OneDrive app installed. If they already have the app installed, though, the OneDrive iMessage app will show them a full preview of the file's contents right within Messages. Each approach has benefits and drawbacks – file previewing from within Messages is a nice user experience, and one that Dropbox doesn't have, but that benefit comes with the potential hassle of installing a new app first. Evernote: Evernote was one of the few productivity apps that launched an iMessage app on iOS 10's release day, and if you use Evernote as your primary note database, you'll likely find a lot to like here. The iMessage app allows you to see recent notes, or search for any other note from your database, and send that note through a message. The nice thing is that all note formatting is retained and presented in an attractive fashion. The one drawback is that for recipients to view a note, they have to download the Evernote app. An account isn't necessary, simply a download; but even still, downloading the app may prove an inconvenience for others. The best use case for Evernote's iMessage app is when you know someone already uses the service, as they'll be able to both view and save any notes you send with ease. Copied: Although Copied is widely considered a productivity app, its iMessage app isn't. It's such a clever app, though, that I wanted to mention it. The iMessage component of Copied won't send text snippets, as you might expect, but instead is used to access your own curated selection of images to send to others. You can set the app up to either display all images that have been saved to Copied in the past, or (my preference) a select group of images that's been organized using the app's Lists feature. Navigating between different image lists within iMessage is even possible. Essentially, this allows you to create your own "sticker packs" consisting of the images you want, organized the way you want. Developers have done an admirable job building powerful iMessage apps that can make life easier. And while it is still the early days of iMessage productivity, I believe the ceiling of iMessage productivity will ultimately be set by Apple, not developers. Building useful apps is one challenge, but conveniently accessing those apps is another. Much like the iPad's multitasking app picker, the iMessage app drawer interface has been flawed since it launched. Organizing and accessing apps is a slow process if you have more than a handful of apps installed. As a result, iMessage apps are less useful than they should be. It's easier to use Spotlight search to open the full Fandango or Venmo apps than it is to navigate the app drawer in Messages. But that can change in the future. Apple could leverage the iMessage platform as a hub for productivity, the way Slack has built a messaging platform on third-party integrations. Whether the company wants to move that direction remains to be seen; perhaps stickers are the peak of Apple's ambition for iMessage apps. It's quite telling that only two first-party apps feature iMessage support – Music and Activity – and one contains only stickers. The work third-party developers have done shows that potential still exists for iMessage apps to make a meaningful contribution to productivity on iOS. Whether that potential will be realized is entirely up to Apple.

The app has an all-new design this year. In 2016, the UI was dominated by dark tones causing speculation that it was a precursor to a system-wide dark mode that didn’t materialize. This year’s update shares some of the same design language as the Apple Music and News apps. In addition to the refreshed design, Apple has added curated video playlists focused on themes like Developing for iPad, interactive maps of the WWDC venue and surrounding area, for the first time, the ability to use of all of the app's features without signing into a developer account, and a new ‘Venue’ tab. Apple is also making a podcast studio available as part of WWDC for attendees who need a space to record shows. Though not mentioned in the release notes, the WWDC app has a little surprise in store in the form of iMessage stickers. The set includes 17 colorful cartoon-style images with an assortment of classic Apple iconography, logos for Metal and Swift, and more. The WWDC app is a free download on the App Store.
