Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Friday, 12 August 2016 | MYT 6:00 AM Apple's baby iPhone is hitting the sweet spot with consumers Little wonders: Apple's iPhone SE saw a successful second quarter in the US and in five European countries. — AFP Relaxnews Many in the tech community questioned Apple's logic in unveiling a new iPhone with a 4in screen when the rest of the industry is making smartphones that are bigger than tablets, but the iPhone SE is proving a hit, particularly in Europe. According to Kantar Worldpanel, whose research is based on responses from a worldwide panel of consumers, the proportion of people plumping for a new iOS handset rather than an Android in the US and in Europe's five main countries, has jumped noticeably over the past three months. Just under one-third (31.8%) of US smartphone sales were of the iOS variety while 18.2% of consumers in the UK, France, Germany, Spain and Italy also went for an iPhone. "In Great Britain, the iPhone SE was the top selling device in the quarter at 9.2%, followed by the iPhone 6s at 9.1%," said Dominic Sunnebo, business unit director for Kantar Worldpanel ComTech Europe. But as well as being a standout hit in the UK, Apple's smallest current handset is proving a global hit, behind only the iPhone 6s/6s Plus and the Samsung Galaxy S7/S7 Edge in terms of sales. "The iPhone SE became the third best-selling phone at 5.1%, contributing to the overall growth of iOS during the period," said Lauren Guenveur, consumer insight director for Kantar Worldpanel ComTech. However, while Apple has taken another small bite out of Android's market share in the US and Europe, its popularity is waning in China and Japan. "In contrast to the growth in the US and EU5, iOS continued to post year-over-year declines in Urban China," said Tamsin Timpson, Strategic Insight Director at Kantar Worldpanel ComTech Asia. "While the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus remain the top selling smartphones in the region, pressure from Huawei's Mate 8, P9, Xiaomi's RedMi Note 3 and Mi 5, and Oppo's R7 has led to increased competition in the market." However, Kantar notes that sales of the iPhone SE were restricted in the region over the last quarter. "[It] was not able to make the expected impact, accounting for 2.5% of smartphone sales in the second quarter," said Timpson. —  AFP Relaxnews You May Be Interested Censorship tool built as Facebook eyes China: report Yew Sin-Ee Yi continue fine run in Hong Kong Pokémon Go: Dittos are hiding in plain sight Fraud in Felda Global Ventures Rejuvenate yourself with American ginseng Apple issues recall on September, October 2015 iPhone 6S Others Also Read Bale likely to miss El Clasico with ankle injury M’sia, Thailand to begin talks on Bangkok-KL HSR project - Thai Minister Japan enlists Sailor Moon to promote safe sex advertisement Latest News Philippines money laundering body charges bankers for ignoring cyberheist Google nears tax settlement with Indonesian government: sources The new Vivo V5 takes the selfie crown Self-driving car group urges US regulators to clear road Singapore unveils self-driving scooter, ideal for phone-obsessed walkers Most Viewed in Tech Apple issues recall on September, October 2015 iPhone 6S Viral video will crash your iPhone The new Vivo V5 takes the selfie crown Pokémon Go: Dittos are hiding in plain sight Google nears tax settlement with Indonesian government: sources Self-driving car group urges US regulators to clear road Israeli firm can steal phone data in seconds Singapore unveils self-driving scooter, ideal for phone-obsessed walkers Pokémon Go says thanks and reshuffles CP Watch your self-ie!

Developers are now permitted to add previously unheard-of capabilities to Phone using Apple’s new application programming interface (API), called CallKit, allowing Voice over IP (VoIP) calls from apps like Skype and WhatsApp to behave like cellular calls. CallKit-enabled apps put contact images on the Lock screen for incoming VoIP calls and are deeply integrated with Contacts and Phone’s Recents and Favorites. Phone on iOS 10 packs in other exciting improvements that we honestly started to believe would never get implemented on the iOS platform, like voicemail transcription à la Google Voice and third-party extensions for detecting spammy calls automatically. So let’s get to it… Video hands-on: new iOS 10 features for the Phone app In addition to much tighter VoIP integration than before, iOS 10’s Phone can ask a third-party app to verify if an incoming call is possibly spam. People cards in Contacts have been revamped with blue buttons for calling people via VoIP apps of your choice and your voicemails are now available as speech-to-text transcriptions. After testing some of the above enhancements, our video editor Andrew O’Hara has put together a quick video walkthrough for those of you who may not have enough time to read through the whole article. The video runs two minutes and 21 seconds long. If you don’t see the embedded clip, watch it on YouTube.

Without further ado, here’s everything Apple has in store for the Phone app on iOS 10. First World Problems with the Phone app In the early days of the iPhone, the stock Phone app offered a good enough experience when it came to ordinary cellular calls and their FaceTime counterparts. But as VoIP apps began to take hold, the user experience gradually suffered with each passing day because the Phone app wasn’t extensible at all. For instance, apps like WhatsApp couldn’t access your Favorites or the list of recent calls. Calls made in VoIP apps didn’t register in Phone’s Favorites and Recents. You couldn’t call a person via Skype by tapping their screen name in the Contacts app. And worse of all, incoming VoIP calls would show as notifications on the Lock screen. This is what folks on pre-iOS 10 releases see when a Skype call comes in. VoIP experience on prior iOS editions left a lot to be desired. VoIP apps were even not permitted to display a fullscreen photo of the person calling on the Lock screen, let alone offer up iOS’s standard Remind Me and Message buttons. And, worst of all, answering a VoIP call from an app like Facebook Messenger from its Lock screen notification simply took you straight to the app. CallKit-enhanced VoIP apps provide the same experience as cellular calls. With CallKit, Apple aims to solve these pain points in one fells swoop. One of the few new frameworks in iOS 10, CallKit was designed to help developers integrate their VoIP apps tightly with the Phone app and the Lock screen. Introducing CallKit CallKit lets VoIP apps integrate with Phone’s interface, allowing the user to easily access any VoIP-enabled calls in Recents and contacts in Favorites. You can view and answer incoming VoIP calls like you would cellular calls. VoIP calls can be muted, put on hold, switched from audio to video and more—right in the Phone app, using its interface and controls you’re already familiar with. VoIP apps integrate with Phone without disrupting its familiar interface. VoIP calls are now allowed to associate a phone number with a name in your contacts and Phone is permitted to tap third-party intelligence to warn you that the incoming call from an unknown number is a possible spam. Other CallKit features Here’s a quick overview of some of the most important features that CallKit enables: VoIP apps take advantage of CallKit to integrate with iOS 10’s Phone app VoIP calls display directly on Lock screen VoIP calls register and are included in Phone’s Recents and Favorite tabs Launch the VoIP app right from the call Place VoIP calls from Phone’s Contacts, Favorites and Recents Mute, Call Waiting and other controls are available for VoIP calls on Lock screen VoIP entries from Contacts can be added to Phone’s Favorites VoIP calls interact with CarPlay and Bluetooth accessories VoIP calls coexist seamlessly with other active calls VoIP calls honor Do Not Disturb setting VoIP calls from people on your blocked list don’t go through User permission is required to allow CallKit-enabled VoIP apps Incoming VoIP calls are checked against your blocked numbers Just to mention briefly, Apple’s partnership with network giant Cisco will let you receive calls made to your work number right on your iPhone. This integration between the iPhone and the Cisco Spark app will be available when iOS 10 launches next month. Ways to call people via VoIP As mentioned, you can now add your VoIP-enabled contacts to your phone’s Favorites to call them like you normally would. And because VoIP calls now appear in Phone’s Recents, returning a missed VoIP call is as easy as tapping its entry in Recents. VoIP calls/contacts integrate with Phone’s Recents/Favorites. In addition to placing VoIP calls without leaving the Phone app, iOS 10 provides this elevated experience elsewhere in the system. For instance, VoIP apps which also happen to integrate with Siri will make it easy to call friends and family using your voice (i.e. “Hey Siri, call my Mom on WhatsApp”). Flow chart shows interactions between CallKit, the system and a VoIP app. The ability for Siri to call people on your behalf using a specific VoIP app will prove indispensable for times when you’re using your iPhone hands-free with a Bluetooth headset. CallKit even extends to Apple’s in-car infotainment platform, called CarPlay. With CarPlay, for example, you would tap the Skype icon, or use Siri Eyes Free, to call a desired contact through Skype. As briefly mentioned, iOS 10 lets you place VoIP calls to people from their contact cards. VoIP apps in Contacts That’s because iOS 10 lets VoIP apps nest their own buttons in contact cards. Although the Contacts app has for years supported adding screen names for chat services like Skype, Facebook Messenger, Yahoo Messenger and so forth, you just couldn’t tap someone’s Skype user name to call them on Skype. iOS 10 lets you do that because interactive buttons for VoIP apps like Skype and WhatsApp now appear on contact cards. Let me state for the record that some of these new CallKit-driven features cannot be tested until first iOS 10-enabled VoIP app updates arrive in the App Store. VoIP calls and your privacy It’s important to note that Apple won’t force you to let any VoIP app integrate with Phone without your permission. Just like you must authorize third-party apps to access your camera or microphone, CallKit-enabled apps will put up a new type of iOS prompt at first run asking for permission to use CallKit. Tap OK and the app integrates with Phone. Or, select Don’t Allow to continue using the VoIP app like before. I’m not sure who’d want to disallow CallKit access for VoIP apps and live without Phone/Lock screen integration, VoIP entries in Recents/Favorites, spam alerts and other perks. Any VoIP apps that you’ve permitted to use CallKit will honor your current Do Not Disturb setting and a list of blocked contacts. Lastly, you can revoke these permissions for VoIP apps by flipping switches in Settings → Phone → Service Providers. Spam handling Phone spam is a major problem, especially in China where it’s spreading like wildfire. iOS 10’s Phone provides an extension point for specialized third-party apps which can provide information automatically if the incoming call is a possible spam. Voicemail transcription If you missed a call from someone important and they left a message in your voicemail, you can see its transcription in Phone → Voicemail. That’s is cool if you want to see what the call was about without listening to voicemail which, by the way, requires cellular connection to download the audio files. Using Siri’s underlying speech-to-text engine, this Google Voice-like feature should do a decent job of transcribing recorded voicemails into text. Just don’t expect the transcriptions to be 100 percent reliable as their accuracy depends on a variety of factors, like pronunciation, call quality, network conditions and so forth. At any rate, it’s good to know that your iPhone transcribes voicemail in case you ever need this feature. Apple has said that voicemail transcription will launch in beta. Taking it all in Apple’s given the somewhat outdated Phone app a much-needed boost with iOS 10. The operating system integrates VoIP apps into all the right places, from your Lock screen to Phone’s Recents and Favorites to people cards in Contacts. And this shall have, methinks, some profound effects on the user experience. No longer will non-techies be wondering why calls from VoIP apps appear as unfriendly Lock screen alerts while FaceTime and cellular calls behave as expected. From a usability standpoint, there should absolutely be no difference between cellular phone calls and those made via third-party VoIP apps. Put simply, iOS 10 ticks all the right boxes when it comes to making and receiving calls and it does so without relegating VoIP apps to second-class citizens, like before. iDB previews iOS 10 We’ve explored other aspects of iOS 10 in rich detail: Beta 5 changes Beta 4 changes Beta 3 changes Beta 2 changes Messages with animated effects, stickers, apps & more Overhauled Lock screen with Raise to Wake, widgets, rich alerts & more Siri meets apps & powers smarter QuickType keyboard suggestions Bedtime and Wake alarm help keeping you well rested For other hands-ons, see our previews of macOS Sierra, watchOS 3 and tvOS 10. iOS 10 availability iOS 10 Developer Preview is available to members of the Apple Developer Program. iOS 10 Public Beta is available to non-developers who are signed on the Apple Beta Software Program. The operating system will release as a free update for the iPhone, iPad and iPod touch this fall. System requirements for iOS 10 are same as those for iOS 9, with the exception of iPhone 4s, original iPad mini and iPad 2 which are are no longer supported. Chime in with your thoughts Are you excited about the upcoming changes for iOS 10’s Phone app? I must admit I rarely use voicemail so I’m not very excited about voicemail transcriptions. On the other hand, as a heavy user of apps like WhatsApp, Viber and Facebook Messenger I’m very much looking forward to the tight integration between Phone and third-party VoIP apps. As a cherry on top of the already delicious cake, third-party Caller ID will definitely save me from the frustration of answering a spam call—that’s one less problem to worry about in dealing with persistent spammers.

The feature sends your current location to emergency officials,” Seitz reports. “Apple also has included the ability to cancel the SOS call within 10 seconds in case the dialing happened accidentally. The SOS feature also can be used for medical emergencies. It can be programmed to share a basic medical ID, giving emergency services your name, age, and listing any medical conditions. It also will automatically message the friends and family you have assigned as contacts.” Read more in the full article here.

Hopefully it doesn’t happen, but that is my worry with it. And media will have a field day with it. michaele11111 Thursday, August 11, 2016 - 9:41 pm · Reply No more so than the idiots who call now saying they can’t find their car keys.

Thursday, August 11, 2016 - 5:52 pm · Reply What will save their lives is when they wise up and quit putting themselves in these situations. It’s just a fact that there are deviants and evil people in this world who will take advantage of woman who don’t take precautions. As far as I’m concerned these women should have been trained and armed to protect their own lives. That is, if the states they live in allow them the basic right of defending their lives. Dan Uff Thursday, August 11, 2016 - 8:05 pm · Reply I don’t know how old you are, How About…but by saying “they (women) should wise up and quit putting themselves in these situations” is like saying people should know better and not get into car accidents. Even if a women takes every precaution to stay safe, that something or someone could still come into that women’s life in the blink of an eye. michaele11111 Thursday, August 11, 2016 - 9:42 pm · Reply Really, really moronic comment. MacRaven Thursday, August 11, 2016 - 10:50 pm · Reply As a female, I somewhat agree with “How about” I am always surprised to see a woman walking home late at night, alone. Or jogging in secluded areas alone. We can say women should be empowered to walk wherever they want any time they want, but the truth is a man with a weapon or a strong one without can put an end to that empowerment real fast. Truth is you have to not put yourself in a position to be easy prey for these sick individuals that do exist no matter how many Take Back the Night protests or empowerment hashtags are texted. These sicko’s don’t care about rights or rules. Women have to be smart enough to avoid risky situations. Granted some men break into homes where you are supposed to be completely safe, or other things go wrong where it should be safe. So anything can happen. It’s a sad situation that sometimes can be avoided and sometimes it’s just nothing else you could have done. But having a weapon could save her life. I don’t have one, but I applaud any woman who does get herself one. Now, Now... Friday, August 12, 2016 - 12:29 am · Reply Here is another female’s point of view… https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sEYGcXSmpQ Herself Friday, August 12, 2016 - 12:39 am · Reply Thanks. As a woman occasionally needing to walk alone at night in the city, I have relied both on my wits and on a concealed weapon. I had to talk my way out of dicey situations a few times, but the feel and sense of my Kimber hardware leant me the confidence to do that. — Before any of you lads suggest women should never walk alone, I suggest you examine yourselves. If YOU had to walk home after dark through a sketchy neighborhood, wouldn’t you welcome being accompanied by myself: armed and dangerous—?

One emergency center out of 250,000 will have the equipment to handle the calls, and that one will not have trained its personnel to operate it. ScreenPhiles Thursday, August 11, 2016 - 11:29 pm · Reply I get the feeling Apple Pay is much more accepted than you ‘re giving it credit for. Just saying. Now, Now... Friday, August 12, 2016 - 12:24 am · Reply Those two female joggers would have been better off armed with a gun and no not Apple’s stupid emoji green squirt gun. Because when seconds count, police are minutes away! David Friday, August 12, 2016 - 8:35 am · Reply Relying on police to save you is stupid 1. Don’t do stupid things with stupid people in stupid places 2. You can only rely on yourself for protection. Carry a gun. (Get training on defense shooting) trondude Friday, August 12, 2016 - 10:19 am · Reply Yup, by the time police arrived, you would be dead. A nice little snub nosed 38 special could have saved them.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search CVS Pay officially unveiled, dashing Apple Pay rumors Brittany A. Roston - Aug 11, 2016 9 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit We’ve known for a few weeks now that CVS Pharmacy has been working on making mobile payments available in its stores, and all signs pointed toward those mobile payments involving Apple Pay. While CVS had confirmed in a roundabout way that it was looking into mobile payments, it didn’t specify platforms one way or the other. Now, it turns out via an official announcement, CVS wasn’t planning to launch Apple Pay: it was developing its own mobile payments platform called CVS Pay. CVS announced the new mobile payments platform today, saying it is an end-to-end payment platform launching in CVS Pharmacy stores. CVS Pay, much like Walmart Pay before it, is part of the CVS Pharmacy app, bringing the payments system, loyalty program, and prescription pickup tools all together in a single mobile destination. Much like Apple Pay, Android Pay, and Walmart’s own version, CVS Pay has customers add their debit and/or credit cards to the CVS Pharmacy app, after which point they can hold their phone out to be scanned when checking out. The app presents a barcode, which the cashier scans. After scanning, the items are scanned, then the customer taps which payment card they want to use within the app. The app can also be used to handle all aspects of prescriptions using a single scannable barcode. In order to verify prescriptions and payments, the user has to enter some kind of detail, like a PIN and signature. Payment confirmations are delivered in-app after the payment goes through. In the present, CVS Pay is available in Pennsylvania, Delaware, New Jersey, and New York, but the company anticipates rolling it out to all stores across the nation by the end of this year. Both iOS and Android apps are supported, with the mobile payment app supporting all major credit cards, including American Express, MasterCard, Visa, and Discover. The app also supports debit cards, HSAs, and Flexible Spending Account cards.

The first one is courtesy of Device Atlas and explores website visits from different devices in Q2 2016. As it turns out Apple's iPhone has lost traffic share in 18 out of 20 countries surveyed. The two unaffected markets are Nigeria and Saudi Arabia. According to the report, the 4" iPhone footprint is still massive with over 20% in Canada, France, Japan, UK and USA. This is probably due to the iPhone SE release. Other interesting details from the study are the rapidly growing share of the Quad HD screens and the noticeable gap in the PPI density in emerging markets vs. developed markets. Finally, the report shows the top 5 most popular devices in a plethora of markets, where the iPhone 6s series and the 4" iPhone 5/SE lineup occupy most of the first and runner-up places. Meanwhile TrendForce issued a report exploring the notebook shipments in Q2 this year. Apple is up big time with sales growing 30% over Q1 thanks to the refreshed MacBook. However that didn't suffice and the company is still down 24% for the first half of 2016 compared to H1 2015. Lenovo and HP remain the market leaders in notebook shipments and both are up from Q2 2015 and H1 2015.

(Reuters/Andrew Kelly) Share Written by Ananya Bhattacharya Obsession Life as Laboratory August 11, 2016 Apple may be diving deeper into the health-care industry. The company filed a patent application for a wearable device that can measure electrocardiographic (ECG) signals through a series of sensors, according to a filing published by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) today (Aug.11). The application leaves the form of the device open ended—it could be a ring, a bracelet, a brooch, or something else—but its sole function is to monitor the heart. The company has already identified health care as an area of big potential. Last year, it released ResearchKit, an open source software framework designed to help doctors and scientists gather data from participants using iPhone apps. And wearables like the Apple Watch are natural ways to collect a variety of information. But the patent application points to something more targeted and sophisticated. Traditionally, ECG machines takes readings from multiple electronic nodes that display results that vary depending on the location of the recording in relation to the heart. Apple’s design makes the placement of the device on the body irrelevant. To calibrate the device, users must undergo an “enrollment” process where readings are taken from different parts of the body before using the device. It can use those measurements to correct abnormalities resulting from the device’s location on a person’s body. A wearable heart monitor. Rumors of the Cupertino giant creating a non-watch health-care wearable have already been circulating. In an interview with The Telegraph last year, CEO Tim Cook said didn’t want to “put the [Apple] Watch through the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) process,” but that he “wouldn’t mind putting something adjacent to the watch through it,” signaling the possibility of a device like the one in the patent filing. Apple’s dive into the medical industry has already shown promising signs. GlaxoSmithKline recently coming onboard Apple’s ResearchKit platform to run a clinical study. If it can find the right applications, the health-care industry could be a big boost for Apple’s wearables business, which so far has been far from a hit. Like many companies, Apple regularly applies for patents for products that never get made. That might be good news for those who are overwhelmed by the Apple Watch simply monitoring their pulse.

Yes, that’s right — there’s yet another way for you to pay with your phone. But CVS’ method, like that of Walmart Pay and Starbucks, is a mobile payment solution that uses a barcode. So unlike the top dogs — Apple Pay, Android Pay, and Samsung Pay — it’s not using near field communication or Magnetic Secure Transmission — you have to open the CVS Pharmacy app, add your credit card information, pull up your barcode at the register, and have the clerk scan your phone. You then choose one of the payment methods you have added and that’s it, your order has been processed and you’ll see confirmation in the app. If you’re at a CVS drive-thru, you only need to share a pickup number, and for prescriptions, you’ll need to verify your identity through the app before orders are processed. Related: Walmart Pay is here to enhance your Walmart shopping experience If you’re a CVS ExtraCare customer, you can link your ExtraCare card to CVS Pay so that you only need to use your phone to access all ExtraCare deals and rewards, and handle payment.

 Apple employees sure love Teslas Kif Leswing Aug. 11, 2016, 5:50 PM 18,968 facebook linkedin twitter email print Elon Musk has a lot of fans at Apple, apparently. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Someone who says they are an Apple employee posted a picture of what looks like an Apple headquarters parking lot to Reddit on Thursday. The picture has since been removed from Reddit, but it included a lot of Tesla cars parked right next to each other. In the photo, you can see a Tesla Roadster, the first car the company released, several Tesla Model S vehicles, and even a few Tesla Model X SUVs, which came out earlier this year. Most of Apple's offices around Silicon Valley are equipped with car chargers, and it's not entirely surprising that Apple employees would prefer Tesla cars, considering the electric-car company has drawn a fair share of inspiration from Apple. As one person in the thread says, people call Teslas the "Palo Alto Camry." And perhaps Apple is drawing inspiration from Tesla as it works on its own electric car.

(Photo: Berkeley) A few years before I became the Observer’s ‘space guy’ I had a very different career at the Walt Disney company. I like to say I was a drone and my duties included training interns from around the world to be drones too. I made no money, was headed nowhere, and was trapped to say the least. That’s until one of my idols, Steve Wozniak, invited me to dinner and substantially altered the course of my life and career. The Woz and I had exchanged a few messages on social media and on Words With Friends where we had  pretty competitive games and exchanges over the course of a couple of years. Apple’s co-founder is known for being welcoming to his fans but I wasn’t expecting to be treated to a dinner I could never afford, at a steakhouse I would never step foot in otherwise. Thankfully, Woz loves steaks. A few days before, I was at work when I heard through the grapevine that Woz would be giving the keynote address at the IBM Innovate Conference at Disney’s Dolphin Resort. This was near Epcot Center—where I worked at the time. I messaged him and asked if I could come shake his hand and say hello before his keynote. He replied right away, enthusiastically. To my surprise, he offered to have a meal with me while he was in town. I assumed it would be with a group of folks from IBM or other fans. But it wasn’t. It was just me and him in a fancy, empty restaurant—Shula’s Steakhouse. As someone who almost bankrupted his parents buying Mac after Mac as a kid, I was nervous as hell. I still have the very first iPod—the one with the wheel. You could say I was a fanboy before Macs were cool. Literally—I was born with a Mac in our house. I barely had enough money to pay for parking at the high-end resort. Woz was waiting for me by the check-in counter. IBM employees stared from across the lobby. It was a far cry from the last time I was there—when one of my bosses tasked me with tracking down an expensive piece of art that had disappeared during delivery. The Woz was gleeful and shook my hand. I suggested we hit the bar for a quick bite because I knew he had an extraordinarily busy schedule. During our previous late night games or chats, he would be in different places around the world giving talks and keynotes. Instead, he insisted we sit down for a real meal. Woz went straight for the surf and turf. I do not remember what I ordered because I so intensely trying not to look and sound like an idiot. I do recall eating some of his mac and cheese. The conversation started casually and I described as briefly as I could, my mundane work day. At the the time, my girlfriend and I had completed a Star Trek pilot in our free time and I told him all about it. He was very open to listening and gave a little feedback. Had an amazing and inspiring dinner with Steve Wozniak tonight. I really can't put into words. A photo posted by Robin Seemangal (@nova_road) on Jun 2, 2013 at 5:25pm PDT That’s when the Woz started giving me some details on Aaron Sorkin’s Steve Jobs film which was being kicked around at Sony at the time. He described having a meeting with Sorkin and joked about how intense he was. From there, Woz talked a little bit about Jobs and their time together building the first Apple computers. It was amazing and surreal. He doesn’t hold contempt for Jobs given their very public falling out in the early days of Apple but instead, reflects fondly on their days together. I was frank with Woz about my lack of formal education and the lack of direction in my career. Woz has pretty radical ideas about education and spoke about what could be the future of learning. He believed that teachers were a thing of the past and that in the future, we would be self-educating using computers and whatever technology was available to an individual student. He believed that anyone with drive would have the world at their fingertips. It’s something that he convinced me was possible and it was something I would run with following that dinner. Our discussion of technology took a surprise turn towards on encryption and privacy. Woz sounded a bit paranoid when he told me that the NSA and relating entities were aggressively expanding their reach and that most of what we thought was private, was not. I didn’t really think too much of it at that moment, until a couple of days later, Edward Snowden would make his famous leak. One fun thing that Woz told me that was relatable to my current situation, was that him and Steve Jobs came to Disney in the late eighties and met with the company about putting the first Apple store on main street at Disney’s Magic Kingdom. Jobs eventually didn’t go for it. He spoke about the constant tug of war between him and his Apple co-founder on everything from motherboard components to the overall vision of the company. I felt undeserving of the insight I was now privy to. Our dinner wrapped up and Woz told me what I assume he tells all his fans after meeting them, that I was a bright young man and he hoped I would do something better with my life. He was convincing and I needed to be convinced. I took his advice. With no money and no clear path ahead, I put in my two weeks notice and left to pursue a career as a writer. Today, I’m just one of the many lives Woz has touched and improved for the better. Even if he wasn’t trying. I may not have gotten JJ Abrams to read my Star Trek pilot, but because of Woz’s inspirational words and my editors at the Observer, I sort of live in it. I get to travel around covering NASA and some of the most interesting and barrier-breaking people on the planet. And I get paid! Happy Birthday, Woz. Thanks for dinner and everything else. Robin Seemangal focuses on NASA and advocacy for space exploration. He was born and raised in Brooklyn, where he currently resides. Find him on Instagram for more space-related content: @nova_road.

Above is a picture of the same spots (only 4 Teslas) from Google Streetview. Apple and Tesla have had a rocky relationship when it comes to poaching employees from each other, but that doesn’t mean Apple employees aren’t fond of Tesla’s work. This is very apparent by this Reddit thread, initiated by an Apple employee. The image attached to the thread shows seven Teslas parked right outside of Apple’s headquarters. The seven Teslas occupy almost all of the electric charging stations outside of Apple’s front entrance, though there are others at other various spots throughout the campus. Of the seven parked out front, there are 2 Model X cars, 4 Model S cars, and yes, even one Roadster. Teslas are incredibly popular among Apple employees and there are likely more than just these six scattered throughout parking at Apple’s HQ. In fact, on Google’s Street View for the area, you can see four Teslas parked out front. Given that Apple is working on its own electric vehicle under the “Project Titan” moniker, the relationship publicly hasn’t been the best between Apple and Tesla. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has referred to Apple as the “Tesla graveyard.” Musk’s comments came during what a poaching war between Apple and Tesla, with both companies poaching employees from the other. Musk has also said that it’s an “open secret” Apple is building an electric car.

Behold one of Apple’s first-ever computers Kif Leswing Aug. 11, 2016, 5:29 PM 24,808 facebook linkedin twitter email print Charitybuzz/Michal Cairns In the summer of 1976, two young friends in Northern California agreed to sell 50 computers to a local store for $500 each. After working for 10 days straight, they pulled it off. That computer went on to be known as the Apple-1, Apple Computer's first product. Those young men were Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs. And now, Apple is the most valuable public company in the world.  One of the computers they built during that time is now up for auction at Charitybuzz. It's an early Apple-1, and the auctioneers think it might actually be a pre-production version. It's one of perhaps 60 Apple-1 computers still in existence.  Currently, it's going for $270,000 after three bids. But the auctioneer thinks the one-of-a-kind computer could be worth as much as $1,000,000.  Take a look:  View As: One Page Slides The auction doesn't just include the computer. It also has full documentation, including an instruction manual, schematics, and tapes. Charitybuzz/Michael Cairns The Apple-1 originally retailed for $666.66. This one is currently going for over $250,000. "It’s Apple’s rookie baseball card," an appraiser said. Charitybuzz/Michael Cairns At the time the computer was built, Apple was based in the Jobs family garage. So Apple used an answering service located at 770 Welch Road, before it moved to Cupertino. Charitybuzz/Michael Cairns This logo was designed by the third Apple founder, Ron Wayne, and was used until 1977, when Apple adopted the logo of the apple shape with a bite taken out. Charitybuzz/Michael Cairns The Apple 1 used tapes with a special peripheral called the Apple 1 Cassette Interface. That doubled the Apple 1 storage capacity from 256 bytes to 512 bytes. One of these tapes contains the BASIC programming language, and the other includes a Star Trek and Blackjack program. Charitybuzz/Michael Cairns The auction comes with an original instruction manual. Charitybuzz/Michal Cairns Let's zoom in. The introduction warns: "Please read Section 1 thoroughly, before attempting to 'power-up' your system..." That's quite the opposite of Apple's approach today, which envisions products people can start using without ever reading the manual. Charitybuzz/Michael Cairns According to the auction listing, this is one of the few known Apple-1 computers to look like it started as a "blank original-run board" instead of a board from the production runs. Charitybuzz/Michael Cairns Some of the components are different from the components that were eventually included in later Apple-1 computers. Charitybuzz/Michael Cairns Some of the components have also degraded over time. Charitybuzz/Michal Cairns This is the backside of the board. YouTube/Charitybuzz It's been cleaned and cared for, and although experts think it can be powered-up, it's not advisable because of its fragility. YouTube/Charitybuzz This board was likely built in the summer of 1976. YouTube/Charitybuzz The first demonstration of the Apple-1 was in July 1976 at the Homebrew Computer Club. YouTube/CharityBuzz The Apple-1 was designed and hand-built by Apple founder Steve Wozniak. YouTube/Charitybuzz Here's the on switch. YouTube/Charitybuzz The Apple-1 was sold at the Byte Shop, in Mountain View, California. Paul Terrell, who owned the store, bought 50 Apple-1 computers for $500 each.   Other extant Apple-1 computers have sold for as much as $330,000, and many are in museums, like this one currently on display at the Sydney Powerhouse Museum. Wikipedia But that one had a case. Wikipedia 10% of the proceeds will go to the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society of Arizona. Current Apple CEO Tim Cook uses Charitybuzz too, to auction off an hour of his time and lunch. This year, lunch with Cook came out to $515,000. CharityBuzz Check out the auction here.

We actually don’t know Thursday, August 11, 2016 · 4:01 pm · 5 Comments “This week, Fast Company published a series of interviews with Apple’s executives from Tim Cook to Eddy Cue and Craig Federighi and Bozama Saint John and if there was one point that was clear across the board is it’s that Apple is built on the core principle of “making great products” but the way to deliver that greatness might look different from what it used to,” Carolina Milanesi writes for Techpinions. “This leads many to believe we are dealing with a different company altogether rather than a company that is evolving.” “Tim Cook said he does not read all the Apple coverage, which means he is possibly spared the many times the ‘Steve would not have done this’ or ‘This would have never happened under Steve’ sentences appear in a commentary,” Milanesi writes. “Aside from the obvious (we actually don’t know what Steve would have done), there is another point many seem to forget — today’s market is very different than it was when Steve Jobs was CEO.” “Different is not necessarily bad. Tim Cook has a different personality than Steve Jobs and, as we learned from this week’s interviews, a different management style,” Milanesi writes. “Apple is evolving and, in my view, doing it faster than it would have done under Steve Jobs. This is crucial for the long-term play.” Read more in the full article here. MacDailyNews Take: Apple has a lot of irons in the fire right now.

Loading... Comment Feed 5 Comments chrish1961 Thursday, August 11, 2016 - 4:28 pm · Reply One point to consider is that even if Steve were still with us, he’d have evolved with Apple. Apple’s principles haven’t changed under cook. Were he still here he’d be running a much different company than ten years ago and he’d probably be doing it much like it’s being done now. Herself Thursday, August 11, 2016 - 4:38 pm · Reply My answer to the question “What would Steve do?” is this: the same thing. First, he’d have retained Cook as COO and scaled up operations smoothly with only a bump or two along the way. Second, he’d have understood the central importance of the iPhone, and placed more focus on it as the hub, with Macs and the rest being secondary. Third, he’d have pushed the Internet of Things, with a particular interest in health monitoring and a more personal car. Fourth, he’d have hired Ahrendts, for her fashion awareness, impressive retail showcases and tailored customer-centric experiences. And finally, he viewed the BYOD movement as a Trojan Horse to breach the enterprise, and eventually win over past adversaries like IBM, partnering with them. Shadowself Thursday, August 11, 2016 - 7:47 pm · Reply “…if there was one point that was clear across the board is it’s that Apple is built on the core principle of ‘making great products’…” That used to be true. Today, the goal is to make Apple great. The premise is that a great Apple will inherently make great products. It’s a false premise. In the second Apple iteration (hell, in the early days too) the underlying premise was, “Get a product to the 95% stage and ship it. Then iterate on it and innovate on that until it becomes what everyone knew from the beginning that it could become.” (As an aside, Dell and their ilk were a “Get a product to 80% and ship it. In the next iteration let’s get it to 85%. In the next get it to 87%, And so forth.) Now Apple is about getting something to market to try to capture as much of that market as possible. Don’t worry about getting it to a 95% solution. Don’t worry about totally blowing the socks off everyone. Sure the original iMac was not perfect, but it was a 95% solution and it surprised everyone — in a good way. Sure, the 30” Cinema Display was not perfect, but it was a 95% solution (maybe 98% solution) and it surprised almost everyone. Sure the first iPod was only a 95% solution and it took a few iterations to get it close to 100% with several surprises along the way. (Remember Jobs pulling the first nano out of the watch pocket of his jeans with the comment, “I always wondered what this pocket was for.”) Sure the iPhone was a 95% solution but it surprised people and took the cell phone world into a new direction. And the list goes on. Since 2012 what Apple product fits that criterion? (Don’t even dare mention the Apple Watch which is really an iPhone peripheral masquerading as a stand alone device. It was an 80% solution that might get upgraded to an 85% solution by the end of this year.) Unless there is a course correction — which I most fervently hope there is within the next year — Apple is headed toward fitting the joke we used to tell about Microsoft products: By version 3.0 it will be usable and good enough. It will never be great. kentkd34 Thursday, August 11, 2016 - 11:46 pm · Reply 85%, 95% whatever. But I question whether the percentage is that high. Shoot for 100% even if you know its not achievable. Settle for 85 or 95 %. Really? Wow Chuckmeister Friday, August 12, 2016 - 12:21 pm · Reply We know exactly what Steve would do.

Purcher reports, “Haptic stimulation can act as notifications for one or more events, such as the receipt of an email, a text message, a news story, a stock price, a reminder, and/or a low power state of a power source in the electronic device.” Read more in the full article here.

By Amy Feldman Biography October 18, 2014 When markets are turbulent, as they’ve been lately, there’s something to be said for sticking with funds that have a long history of downside protection. Franklin Mutual Global Discovery (ticker: TEDIX), which has $26 billion in assets and a 22-year history of buying undervalued stocks, is one such fund. “Obviously, the names change, and the world changes, but our fundamental approach is very consistent,” says co-manager Peter Langerman, who is also Franklin Mutual Advisors’ CEO. The fund’s strategy, since the days when Mutual Series was run by Max Heine and legendary value investor Michael Price, has involved searching for companies, wherever they might be, that trade at a discount to what the managers figure is their intrinsic value.

Langerman and his co-managers—Philippe Brugère-Trélat and Timothy Rankin—aren’t afraid to be activists, pushing holdings to reallocate capital or make other changes to their businesses, and they’re not averse to waiting. Turnover, at 24%, is well below that of the fund’s world-stock peers, according to Morningstar. The fund’s results have been especially good in down markets, such as 2001, though performance tends to trail rival funds during rallies, as occurred in 2012. Over the past five years, Franklin Mutual Global Discovery has returned an average annualized 8.6%, versus 6.5% for the MSCI World Index. Barron’s visited the managers in their Short Hills, N.J., office, to see where they’re finding opportunities today. The global fund’s exposure to U.S. stocks has continued to climb—U.S. stocks now make up 52% of the portfolio, up from just 14% five years earlier. But they’re also finding value in global energy companies and European banks. The fund also has a cash stake of 9%, giving it the flexibility to move quickly as deals come up. Until the recent selloff, Langerman said, the fund had been trimming and getting out of positions that were approaching their target valuations. “It’s harder today than it’s been for a while,” he said then. But as the market has tumbled, it has created a better environment for these value managers to buy—and they’re searching out new ideas and adding to existing equity and debt positions on the cheap.

Sources: Morningstar; MSCI; Franklin Templeton Langerman, 59, and Brugère-Trélat, 64, have been running the fund since 2009; Rankin, 42, became a co-manager in 2010. But all three have been at the firm for many years. Langerman, a onetime bankruptcy attorney, joined the firm in 1986 as an analyst. Brugère-Trélat joined two years earlier, after French President François Mitterrand nationalized the private bank where he had been working. Rankin, 42, arrived at the firm in 1997 after a stint as an equity analyst. Today, the trio is finding opportunities in energy, which represents 10% of holdings, and includes Royal Dutch Shell (RDS.A) and Apache APA 1.6705618696974547% Apache Corp. U.S.: NYSE USD63.5136 1.0436 1.6705618696974547% /Date(1479928855654-0600)/ Volume (Delayed 15m) : 1352891 P/E Ratio N/A Market Cap 23702929193.3337 Dividend Yield 1.5725743041358704% Rev. per Employee 1322800 More quote details and news » APA in Your Value Your Change Short position (APA). Both are restructuring plays, snapped up during difficulties. “We don’t want to just make a commodity bet,” Langerman says. At Shell, for example, the managers wrote a letter to the management and board, and held follow-up calls. Today, they’re heartened by Shell’s new CEO, Ben van Beurden, who has committed to selling assets and cutting investment spending. In Europe, the managers historically owned food, drink, and tobacco stocks, but today, they’re finding better deals in financials, especially the banks. “There was a perception that the European banks were behind the curve in adapting to the new market environment, compared with the U.S. banks, both in terms of balance-sheet size and capital ratios, but there has been a tremendous change in the way banks have managed those two issues over the past two years,” says Brugère-Trélat, who also manages the Franklin Mutual European fund (TEMIX). The Global Discovery fund owns banks in France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and Italy, including BNP Paribas BNP.FR -1.3133524162316887% BNP Paribas S.A.

While clouds still loom in Europe’s low growth, many of Europe’s best banking franchises are cheap, he says. “We like very solid retail-oriented banks that are trading at a significant discount, relative to American banks. Where else can you find banks trading at a discount to book?” The trio also likes some U.S. financials, such as large banks, including Citigroup C 0.8199643493761141% Citigroup Inc.

It’s a little bit over book value at this point, and it’s got low-double-digit earnings growth per share. And they’re still in the midst of their restructuring.” Mergers and acquisitions have begun to pick up amid low growth and low interest rates, Langerman says. “We’ve been quite active,” he says. That activity has included controversial tax inversions, in which one company buys another based in a lower-tax country, with the intention of moving the joined firm’s headquarters there.

Distressed companies, historically a larger part of the fund, have been a tougher bet recently as default rates among corporate bonds have stayed at low levels. “We’re looking, and they’re chunky,” Langerman says. “It’s like M&A: You’re not doing anything, and then all of a sudden, there’s a huge deal and you can put $500 million to work. You just have to be there and be able, ready, and willing to act.” With a few billion in cash on hand, the ability to move quickly shouldn’t be a problem.

Daniel Sparks (TMFDanielSparks) Aug 11, 2016 at 4:06PM With the S&P 500 trading at all-time highs and soaring about 95% in the past five years, it's tempting to conclude that buying opportunities have disappeared. However, while there certainly may be fewer bargain investments than there were in the stock market five years ago, there are still a few enduring businesses worth buying today that could yield handsome profits for investors. Indeed, three stocks look particularly enticing after selling off in the past year: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS), and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX). ^SPX data by YCharts. All three of these companies boast focused, enduring business models with excellent track records, yet their stocks are trading at valuations low enough to make them a buy. This isn't something that can be said every day about iconic brands consumers are using on a daily basis. Here's why each of these stocks is worth buying and holding. A straight-up steal A wildly conservative valuation of Apple -- a valuation based on a forecast for growth no better than the historical rate of inflation -- pegs the stock's fair value at just under $130 per share. With shares trading at just $108 today, the stock is trading at a meaningful discount to fair value. Image source: Apple. But is such a lackluster forecast for the company's growth prospects realistic? In the past, the company has repeatedly wielded its brand recognition and pricing power in new segments, driving significant growth for the company -- and there's little reason to think the tech giant couldn't do it again. In addition, the same Apple garnering a higher switching rate from other smartphones to iPhone today than ever before will likely continue to attract new customers, keep existing customers around, and convince deeply entrenched users to keep buying new Apple products for years to come. Apple's seamlessly integrated ecosystem of hardware, software, and services has built the company both a "sticky" business model to retain its loyal customer base and a moat to keep competitors at bay. As investors fret about Apple's declining iPhone sales in 2016 as the company faces the tough comparisons to its monster iPhone 6 cycle last year, the pullback in the stock price offers investors an attractive entry point. An undervalued collection of brands and franchises Imagine if you could buy a slice of some of the world's hottest characters, brands, and franchises in entertainment -- think Disney, Marvel, Star Wars, Pixar, ESPN -- all at a bargain price. You can. Thanks to the stock's underperformance recently, investors can pick up shares of Walt Disney, which owns all of these brands and franchises, for a price-to-earnings ratio of just 18 -- a steal compared to where the stock was trading as recently as late last year. DIS PE Ratio (TTM) data by YCharts. A testament to these franchises' pricing power, Walt Disney's collection of powerful assets generated a record $9.2 billion in net income during in the trailing 12 months -- nearly doubling the company's $4.8 billion in net income in fiscal 2011. Going forward, there's no reason to believe Walt Disney won't continue to effectively squeeze everything it can out of its diversified set of powerful assets. Yes, Disney's transition of ESPN from its cable roots to an Internet-streaming future may be introducing some near-term challenges, but the dominant sports network isn't going anywhere. As investors question the future of ESPN, now is a good time to buy a slice of some of the most enduring brands in the world. A focused bet on the inevitable transition to streaming TV Netflix stock isn't cheap -- at least it's not when compared to its slower-growing peers. Its price-to-sales ratio of 5.4 is almost twice Disney's of 2.9. But a dominant player in the middle of a huge secular trend shouldn't be expected to trade conservatively. Fortunately, however, Netflix stock has been slammed recently, declining 22% in the past 12 months, making it more enticing than it was. Not only is Netflix growing rapidly, but it's building out a massive library of compelling, original content. Image source: Netflix. Living up to its valuation, the company is seeing rapid growth. On the back of an undeniable shift toward streaming TV, Netflix's total streaming members have increased from 65.6 million to 83.2 million during the past 12 months. And growth persists; in Q3 alone, the company expects to add 2.3 million more streaming members. Longer-term opportunities look significant, too. Management expects its U.S. member base will eventually peak between 60 to 90 million members -- up from 47 million today. And with just 38 million streaming members outside of the U.S., Netflix's international expansion still has significant room to run. Still, if the company's long-term potential truly is compelling, why are shares down 22% in the past year? The sell-off follows two arguably shortsighted concerns: Investors expected faster international adoption, and the company missed its second-quarter guidance for streaming members as extensive media coverage of the company's price increase sparked near-term headwinds in member churn rates. These concerns are creating buying opportunity, as both are arguably worse than they seem. In international markets, Netflix is working to localize its international offerings in order to attract more customers. And the company's price increase was actually well received by the members being un-grandfathered into the higher price; it was simply confusion among other members about hyped media coverage of the price increase that prompted the worse-than-expected churn. While they are trading lower, now is a great time for investors to buy shares of these iconic companies and hold them for the long haul. Investors who buy these stocks today may be sitting on much larger portfolios 10 years from now. Daniel Sparks owns shares of Apple.

Just last month, the country was threatening to ban the devices in what it was calling an anti-smuggling move. All that threat did in turn, however, was drive up the price of iPhones already in the country and actually increase smuggling. The trade ministry in the country has gone to the Traded Promoting Organization and requested licenses for nine Iranian companies to import Apple’s smartphone. Apple currently doesn’t have a retail presence – or any other presence – in Iran, though unofficial Apple Stores are increasingly common. Iran is preparing to allow local companies to import iPhones for the first time to try to curb the huge market in smuggled Apple products, state media reported Thursday. The trade ministry has requested licences from the country’s Trade Promotion Organisation for nine Iranian companies to import iPhones, according to the Tasnim news agency. Unofficial Apple stores are common in Tehran’s upmarket malls, and many of the country’s young and wealthy population carry the latest models of iPhone. iPhones have long been smuggled into Iran and the government has largely ignored the problem, but over the past two months the attitude had changed. The government’s original plan was apparently to ban the import and use of iPhones and focus on registering phones that were legally in the country. With the legalization of importing iPhones, however, Iran will now be able to register all mobile phones for the first time. When Iran’s plans to register all phones came to light last month, mobile operators, customers, and the union of mobile phone sellers were concerned as to how the data would be used. Those concerns appear to still be there, though, and the government has not yet commented. Further complicating the issue, U.N. sanctions against Iran mean that U.S. companies have limited ability to sell their products in Iran. Apple last year, however, started discussions with Iranian distributors hoping to ease the sanctions as time passed. Whether or not the decision to allow the importing of iPhones is a sign of easing regulations remain to be seen. Apple has not recently commented on its efforts in the country.

However, a new patent filing published this week, suggests any handset resistant to the wet stuff will also take pretty awesome underwater photos. The 2013 filing, granted in 2015 and unearthed by Patently Apple (via Wired) explains new colour-balancing editing software, which would “remove undesirable tints from objects in a scene,” to ensure the water looks blue. Related: What is IP68: Waterproof ratings explained The filing states: “Removing undesirable tints without removing the tint of the water itself results in images with more realistic coloring of people and objects in the scene, without eliminating the color cues (e.g., blue water) that indicate that the image is a photograph of an underwater scene.” Given the filing is three years old, rather than newly made, it would indicate the technology might now be ready for prime time. Of course, Apple does not roll all of its parents into real world gadgets, but there is cause to believe the company may do on this occasion. Multiple rumours have suggested next month’s iPhone 7 will be the first to officially claim water resistance. The current iPhone 6S has been shown to offer some level of waterproofing, but it’s not something Apple has ever acknowledged. While better underwater photos would be a bonus, it seems highly unlikely it’ll be a tool that can be used by divers. Most smartphones claiming water resistance only do so to depths of 1.5 metres for around 30 minutes. That would make it ideal for a scuba session at least.

Apple Evan Selleck Contributing Editor | August 11, 2016 50 shares 33 9 0 8 0 0 0 0 0               By the time Apple got around to releasing the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, big smartphones were a pretty common element in the smartphone market. Devices with 4.7-inch displays, and bigger, were all over the place, even some with screens reaching up to six inches or more. Some of you out there might even remember seeing pictures of people holding up tablets with similar screen sizes to their faces, and how silly we all thought that was back then. Here we are where five-inch smartphones being the norm, and bigger devices managing to pack in plenty of features to make the bigger screens worthwhile. I think it’s pretty fair to say that Samsung has led that charge, both in adopting bigger smartphones, and also letting even bigger “phablets” find a way into our lives, too. Of course, there is a difference between a smartphone with a big screen and a phablet, as Samsung continues to try and push with the release of its Galaxy Note phablet lineup. A combination of a tablet and a phone, there should be something that truly differentiates a phablet from a run-of-the-mill smartphone. In the case of the Galaxy Note7, for instance, and just like every previous Galaxy Note phablet before it, that differentiator comes in the form of a stylus. The S Pen has come a long way over the years, now more advanced than ever, easier to use, and probably won’t get stuck inside the device, either. The S Pen also activates specific features that aren’t readily available without it, like being able to write notes on the display when it’s locked, or being able to magnify the screen elements to get a closer look. You can even create a GIF with the help of the S Pen now. When Apple launched the iPhone 6 Plus, the company didn’t have an official stylus under its umbrella of products. Back then, in fact, a stylus seemed like an impossibility, considering the company’s staunch stance on the idea for so many years when talking about tablets. But then the 12.9-inch iPad Pro arrived with its Smart Keyboard and Apple Pencil, and suddenly the tables had turned. The Apple Pencil is an amazing accessory, one of the best stylus I’ve ever used, and the same sentiment can be heard echoed all over the place. Apple came out of the gate swinging into the stylus market with the Pencil, and it will (probably) only get better from here. So what about adding support to the 5.5-inch iPhone lineup? After some consideration, I thought this would be a pretty solid idea for the iPhone 7 Plus, and beyond, and Apple could introduce specific features within the larger iPhone that would make it perfectly suitable for the Apple Pencil as an input device. As a reference point, the Galaxy Note7 only features a 5.7-inch display, so the difference here isn’t that big. But then I weighed all those rumors about an iPhone 7 Pro – a device that would sit at the very top of the pyramid when it comes to iPhones, with standout hardware and software features when compared to its brethren. This could be one way to make the iPhone support the Apple Pencil – just make a Pro model, like Apple has done with the iPad lineup. This type of distinction between devices wouldn’t bum me out as much as a difference between the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, simply because it would be more than just a change in screen sizes that offer, for whatever reason, more features. A Pro model of an iPhone would be geared towards folks who not only need the bigger screen, but also want that support for a stylus, too. With all the rumors swirling around that an iPhone Pro exists, or has at least existed at some point, I can’t help but wonder if this is something that’s more inevitable than questionable. The Pro lineup for tablets has worked for Apple thus far, so why not extend that thinking to the iPhone family? What do you think? Would you buy a phablet iPhone with supported features and Apple Pencil support? Or should Apple keep the Pencil with the iPad lineup only? Let me know!

Jordan Kahn - 3 months ago @JordanKahn MacBook Pro Apple View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit There has been a lot of talk about the OLED touch bar rumored for the upcoming MacBook Pro refresh expected this fall. But how exactly will the touchscreen work for users? If you’ve not been paying attention, Apple is thought to be working on a new slimmer MacBook Pro that according to reports will feature a thin touchscreen on the keyboard in place (or possibly above?) the top row of the keyboard. The top keyboard row currently includes function keys, aka the F1-F12 keys that double as quick keys for screen brightness, Mission Control, iTunes media transport controls, etc. So it’s thought that the new touchscreen might replace the function keys and offer those functions as contextual buttons on the touchscreen. But surely Apple won’t JUST use the new OLED touchscreen for digital versions of the function keys it already has? Menu bar and Dock A couple of the maybe obvious options would be to bring down buttons from the menu bar or dock that maybe aren’t currently as accessible directly from the keyboard. Having the dock would allow for quick keys for access to, of course, all of the apps and windows in your dock, which I’d expect alone would be much more useful than the current function keys if they are indeed being replaced by the OLED touch screen entirely. App-specific keys But perhaps a better approach to the display will be, as we previously speculated, to offer contextually sensitive buttons, offering up different function keys depending on what app you’re currently using. Sort of like how the menu bar functions currently change in macOS depending what app you’re focused on, the OLED display could offer up app-specific commands, like media transport controls for iTunes, frequently visited sites, bookmarks or navigation controls for Safari, or customized toolbar items for other apps like Finder, Logic Pro, or Pages. The iOS keyboard, even when using an attached Bluetooth keyboard, offer similar functionality, as noted by 9to5 readers.  If Apple does take this kind of approach, and I’m hoping it does, it may or may not allow third-party developers to take advantage by building their own quick keys for the feature. Touch ID Apple is also working on integrating Touch ID functionality into the Mac, which would allow it to unlock the fingerprint-based tech for payments and authentication/unlocking of the Mac and other apps like it does on iOS devices. But the TouchID functionality according to our sources is currently being integrated into the power button of the MacBook, which would presumably be separate from the OLED touch bar. There have been rumors and Apple patents in the past detailing methods of embedding Touch ID like functionality underneath displays, but that’s something Apple has yet to introduce in an actual product. Apple is said to be planning an upgraded pressure sensitive home button for iPhone 7 with haptic feedback, but it’s unclear if that will mean physical changes to the appearance of how it’s integrated into the device.  An OLED Touch Bar for other Macs? If Apple does believe in the rumoured OLED touch bar as a serious hardware innovation for the MacBook, then what does that mean for the rest of its Mac lineup? Will the shiny new hardware be limited to the MacBook Pro? Then there was the concept above that imagined what the feature might look like on a new Apple keyboard for other Macs. If Apple does take the contextually sensitive, app-specific approach to the new hardware like I’m hoping, developer adoption for third-party apps will of course be limited by the fact the feature is only available on the new MacBook Pro at launch. How would you like Apple to take advantage of the new OLED touch screen for MacBook Pro?

VIEW ALL PHOTOS IN GALLERY Apparently, the PlayStation 4 Neo isn't the only thing we'll be hearing about on Sept. 7. Word has it that Apple is planning an event the same day. Bloomberg on Wednesday reported that the Cupertino tech giant has "an event currently scheduled for Sept. 7 to introduce next-generation versions of the iPhone." Granted, Apple has not made any official announcements, so this is not confirmed. But Bloomberg heard it from "people familiar with the matter," so it has to be true, right? Apple didn't immediately respond to PCMag's request for comment, and a spokesman for the tech giant flat-out declined Bloomberg's request. VIEW ALL PHOTOS IN GALLERY Last month, well-known and reliable leaker Evan Blass, who commonly shares inside information about upcoming smartphones on his Twitter account, tipped a Sept. 16 next-gen iPhone release. That Sept. 16 date, according to Blass, is when the phone will hit store shelves, suggesting that Apple's launch event would happen before. So Bloomberg's sources could be right about this. Last year, Apple held its fall iPhone event on Sept. 9 and released the phones Sept. 25. //Related Articles 13 Secret Codes That Unlock Hidden Features on Your Phone As for what to expect from Apple's big announcement, don't get your hopes up for any major changes. The Wall Street Journal, citing unnamed people "familiar with the matter," recently reported that Apple is planning "only subtle changes" for the upcoming models. They will likely be thinner, but with the same 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch screen sizes used for the past two years. Meanwhile, more significant changes are reportedly in the works for Apple's MacBook Pro laptop lineup. The upcoming notebooks, which are rumored to support Touch ID and have OLED touch bar where the function keys would normally be, won't be making their debut on Sept. 7, however, according to Bloomberg's sources.

Click Apple Watch Could Save Your Life With Upcoming Feature The upcoming SOS feature for the Apple Watch acts as a panic button for a wearer to call 911 from the watch. (Apple) PATRICK SEITZ 8/11/2016 Reprints The recent murders of two female joggers in separate incidents on the East Coast show the need for mobile technology that can quickly contact police in an emergency. An upcoming feature for Apple's (AAPL) smartwatch could be a lifesaver. The SOS feature in the watchOS 3 software update, due out this fall, acts as a panic button for people to call 911 from their Apple Watch. To activate SOS and call 911 for help, you only need to press and hold the side button on the Apple Watch for about three seconds. The feature works wirelessly with a user's iPhone to automatically initiate a call with local emergency services. Many joggers strap their iPhone to their arm and play music while they're running. The unsolved murders this month of Karina Vetrano in Queens, N.Y., and Vanessa Marcotte in Princeton, Mass., have served as a wake-up call to women who jog alone. In the wake of their deaths, many fitness enthusiasts likely would be receptive to any technology that could keep them safer. Apple says the feature will work in all countries where the watch is sold. The feature sends your current location to emergency officials. Shares closed down less than 0.1% at 107.93. IBD'S TAKE: With iPhone sales declining, Apple needs new products like the Apple Watch to drive growth. The N in IBD's CAN SLIM Investing System stands for "new," such as new products, services or management that can help drive profits and share prices higher. Apple also has included the ability to cancel the SOS call within 10 seconds in case the dialing happened accidentally. The SOS feature also can be used for medical emergencies. It can be programmed to share a basic medical ID, giving emergency services your name, age, and listing any medical conditions. It also will automatically message the friends and family you have assigned as contacts. Apple introduced the SOS feature in its keynote presentation at the company's Worldwide Developers Conference in San Francisco on June 13. "We're finding that people who are wearing Apple Watch wear it all the time and this opens up some new, great ways that we can help," Kevin Lynch, vice president of technology at Apple, said at WWDC. "One of these is actually getting help in critical situations, just by pushing a button that's actually on you. So you might be having a medical emergency or a safety situation (and can use SOS)." It's a feature that people will rarely, if ever, need, but it's great to have, he said.

The app was developed in conjunction with Detroit-based mobile app developer jācapps and with collaboration from Apple. “To the best of our knowledge, it’s the first for a broadcast radio station (and of course a first for jācapps),” Jacobs Media President Fred Jacobs wrote in an email.  Apple CarPlay is currently available on more than 100 car models, mimicking the touchscreen experience of an iPad or iPhone in the car dashboard. jācapps COO Bob Kernen characterized the development as putting radio “front and center on the Apple CarPlay screen” and “a giant step forward for the entire radio industry in its quest to remain dominant in today’s cars.” “jācapps’ App Everywhere platform is giving us the flexibility of distribution that our audiences are demanding in a very efficient service,” Greater Media Director of Digital Operations Steve Meyers said in the announcement. jācapps is also developing mobile apps for the Android Auto system, the first of which launched on that platform in 2015.   Receive regular news and technology updates.

MacDailyNews Take: Appel isn’t a “roadmap” company. Smart companies will have to learn to live with some element of surprise from Apple – and, in toto, they will profit from it.

All those years of building applications around IE …and then trying to fix broken compatibility. That opened up people to alternatives..I’ve heard from our IT directors. trondude Thursday, August 11, 2016 - 2:16 pm · Reply Most if not all ‘enterprise’ companies are going to go with vendors who offer support contracts. Back in 2004, Apple had such a service and it worked well. But now, they have forsaken that for the consumer market, and left MS to fill the void (among other business vendors). A company with any sense will always have support contracts in place to mitigate downtime and therefore, lost business and revenue. That is the game with enterprise IT. It isn’t just about using ios and OSX, as we know they are superior systems to MS offerings, but if you cannot get timely support (within 1 hour) then you do not know how to manage your ‘enterprise’. Apple is not in that position anymore, and that is why most are still stuck with MS and its supported business apps, etc. Danox Thursday, August 11, 2016 - 3:28 pm · Reply MS, sucks and always will, all Apple needs to do is make a very good product and sell it, simple M Thursday, August 11, 2016 - 5:00 pm · Reply True, but Apple fills a niche..meaning, limited to iOS and allowing a few Macs on the network for stuff that needs a Mac (I’m in the latter group). We aren’t talking about servers and Macs for everyone. iOS has a very strong presence in enterprise. Our facility, the largest employer in my not so small city, replaced pagers with iPhones, for example. The IT admins, engineers, even maintenance, all have iPads.

For those who aren’t in the loop, ConnectED is a program started by the Obama Administration to help provide cutting-edge technology to schools in the United States. Apple pledged $100 million towards iPads, computers, and other Apple devices. As it stands, Apple is aiding 144 schools. As of today, Apple has 32,145 iPads in the hands of students and 9,042 teachers, as a part of ConnectED program. On top of this, 4,434 hours of “Apple Professional Learning” have been taught by Apple representatives at schools. As the 2016-2017 school year kicks off, there are now 32,145 students at underserved public schools across the country who are learning, creating and exploring on iPad through Apple’s ConnectED commitment. Today, 701 students in Indianola, Mississippi, were introduced to iPad as Carver Elementary School became the 66th ConnectED school — and the first of the school year — to transform its classrooms with Apple’s cutting edge teaching and learning technology solutions. In addition to providing an iPad to every student and teacher, Apple’s ConnectED grant also includes professional learning, wireless infrastructure upgrades and ongoing support. The full breakdown can be found on Apple’s ConnectED page. Tags: Connected, Education, iPad About Peter Cao Peter has a passion for music and technology.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Earlier this week, we learned Apple might be working on a “killer” health device set to launch next year. Now a new patent application may reveal what the company is cooking up. Cupertino’s latest application for a patent details a wearable electrocardiogram (ECG) that you can wear anywhere on your body to monitor the electrical activity of your heart. The device would be able to recognize where it is in relation to your heart and then recalibrate to provide accurate data. Apple also notes that it could be fashioned into various shapes, including a watch, ring, pendant or brooch to match any outfit or activity. The company is expected to launch a new Apple Watch or two later this year, but the smartwatch probably won’t push too far into the health market. Apple has previously said it doesn’t want the device to get bogged down in a lengthy FDA approval process. Instead, the company could pack its more advanced medical technology into a separate product like the one listed in this filing, though there’s no guarantee this futuristic ECG will ever see the light of day.

Apple recently released iOS 9.3.4, which will likely be the company's final update before it comes out with iOS 10 (and possibly a new iPhone, but we'll get to that later). The official description of the update says it "provides an important security update for your iPhone or iPad and is recommended for all users." But Forbes and other media outlets have alleged that what it really does is prevent people from using a newly developed jailbreak method from Pangu. "There is nothing more to it, no performance improvements, no refinements or new features, nothing," Neurogadget wrote Thursday. It recommended users "think twice before upgrading," especially if they're interested in jailbreaking their devices. If you decide you want to update your iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch with iOS 9.3.4, you can go to Settings > General > Software Update and click "download and install." Related Stories A10 Chip, Rumored To Power iPhone 7, Appears In Leaked Photo Apple To Release Health-Centric Apple Watch Next Year However, most of the Apple fervor this week was around iOS 10, which is rumored to be coming out in September alongside the iPhone 7. iOS 10's beta 4 was released to the public to test on Tuesday, BGR reported. iOS 10 will let users write in Messages, send each other animations, exchange hidden photos, use Siri for apps, book reservations in Maps, access a redesigned News app and more, according to the Apple website. Perhaps most importantly, iOS 10 will come with dozens of new emoji. Apple will now let users choose from female athletes and more diverse characters. The gun will become a water pistol, and there will be a pride flag, TechCrunch reported. The new operating system will work on iPhone models 5 through 6s, iPad mini 2 through iPad Pro and the 6th generation iPod Touch.

Football Conference game at the Apple Bowl—they were wearing different uniforms. Harney, a defensive lineman with the Okanagan Sun, and Thompson, an offensive lineman with Westshore Rebels, played seven seasons of minor football together in their hometown of Squamish. The two were teammates again for one season of high school ball at Howe Sound, then spent both the 2014 and 2015 seasons together at Bishop's University in Quebec. After spending a decade as teammates, Harney, 20, and Thompson, 21, both made the jump this season to the B.C. Football Conference, but to different destinations. "It was a little strange to see us not with the same team, that hasn't happened too often," said Harney. "It's all about the path that each of us are taking in football, and it's good to see (Tyson) continuing on. He's a big guy, a good player and I'm proud of him. It was nice to see him." With Harney resting an injury, the two didn't get a chance to go head-to-head during Saturday night's 27-21 win by the Sun, but met on the field afterwards. "He's like a brother to me," the 6-foot-5 Thompson said of Harney. "It was really good to see him Saturday. I'm happy for him and the success his team is having, but losing tasted a little sour at the same time. "You're always friends no matter what, but you still want to win. I know James feels the same way." Harney and Thompson, who are in contact on a weekly basis, will see each other again on Saturday, Sept. 10 when the Sun travels to Victoria. This time, assuming he's healthy enough to play, Harney plans to prove a point to Thompson, who is not only his close friend but now his rival. "It's going to be fun, we're going to see who's the better player," Harney said with a laugh. "There's always a little harassment between us about who's the better football player." This weekend, Harney and the Sun will host the Vancouver Island Raiders, while Thompson and the Rebels are on the road to face the Kamloops Broncos.   We encourage an open exchange of ideas on this story's topic, but we ask you to follow our guidelines for respecting community standards.

 Why Apple's big event tomorrow is going to be exciting, even if the iPhone 7 is boring Antonio Villas-Boas Sep. 6, 2016, 11:33 AM 97,359 facebook linkedin twitter email print Martin Hajek The iPhone 7 is going to be a snooze. That's what everyone is saying about Apple's upcoming iPhone because, apparently, it won't come with a beautiful new design. That's what we'd usually expect this year, considering that the latest iPhone — the 6S — is the "tock" in Apple's two-year tick-tock cycle. Instead, the iPhone 7 will supposedly look exactly like the iPhone 6 generation, and it doesn't seem like its new features will be all that exciting. At the same time, despite the rumors of a boring upcoming iPhone, Apple's big iPhone event that's taking place tomorrow on September 7 could be very interesting, as we could potentially see a total refresh in what to expect from the company in the future. And since I'm interested in technology, I can't wait to hear how, or if, one of the biggest tech companies in the world is going to change things up about one of the most impactful pieces of technology ever released. CEO Tim Cook. Stephen Lam/Getty Images A new way of doing things For one, we'll finally find out if Apple will indeed switch up its usual two-year iPhone release cycle, which it hasn't done since the release of the iPhone 3G in 2008. Supposedly, Apple is planning to release an iPhone with a fresh new design in 2017 to celebrate the iPhone's 10th anniversary. As I mentioned above, we'd normally expect a new iPhone with a new design this year. That's significant because we might be waiting three years between each iPhone generation instead of the usual two from now on. It could change everything about how and when people buy iPhones. Will it change how often you buy one? Will you buy the first, second, or third model? The most recent supposedly leaked image of the next iPhones. Letemsvetemapplem The only hint at what the next iPhones will be called came from a sketchy rumor from a German Apple blog called Apfelpage.de, which claimed that it will be called the "iPhone SE." And there's always the chance that the three-year cycle is a one-time thing. Apple could return to the usual two-year cycle after the supposedly special iPhone that Apple has in store for 2017. No one knows, which is why I'll be listening very attentively during Apple's iPhone event. The headphone jack Pretty much every rumor is claiming that Apple's upcoming iPhone will not have a headphone jack, which sounds completely crazy because almost every device that can play music has a headphone jack. Instead, we'll either be using Bluetooth or the Lightning port to listen to music. There are several rumors and theories as to why Apple would ditch the headphone jack on the next iPhone. Some say that it'll let Apple make thinner iPhones. Others say that the digital signal from the iPhone's Lightning port makes music sound better. Austin Evans/YouTube But the only explanation that matters is the one Apple provides. Hopefully, the company will give some sort of reasoning as to why it's removing the most universal and ubiquitous connection port for listening to music. I am looking forward to understanding why I might not be able to plug in my wired headphones anymore. Apple could also not even give an explanation. Motorola didn't mention the fact that the new Moto Z doesn't have a headphone jack during its event. There was no justification, no explanation, no reasons why it's better this way. Apple's iPhone event is happening on September 7, and it'll be interesting to see how everything about the iPhone will change, even if its design this year remains the same.

Days after Apple launched its first bug bounty program, zero-day hunters Exodus Intelligence upped the ante. Apple will pay hackers up to $200,000 to identify vulnerabilities in its products. Exodus, meanwhile, is offering up to $500,000. Cybersecurity researchers are invited to participate in the new Research Sponsorship Program (RSP), which awards bounties for both zero-day flaws and exploits against patched (n-day) vulnerabilities. Currently, iOS 9.3+ flaws are going for a max of $500,000, while Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge bugs could earn you up to $150,000 or $125,000, respectively. Found Firefox vulnerabilities can net you up to $80,000, Windows 10 up to $75,000, and Adobe Reader and Flash up to $60,000 each. The firm is also offering a bonus structure for zero-day vulnerabilities, which adds to the initial payment for every quarter the exploit remains alive. "Through the launch of the RSP, Exodus is excited to be engaging the global research community in our mission to provide the highest quality of vulnerability intelligence in the industry," company president Logan Brown said in a statement. Registered users can view zero-day and n-day hit lists on the new RSP website. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. //Related Articles Uber Launches Bug Bounty Program The tech titan—a long-time holdout in the bug bounty arena—announced its new program during last week's Black Hat event in Las Vegas. Compensation ranges from $25,000 for a sandbox break to $200,000 for a secure boot hardware exploit. The program covers five issues, all on iOS or iCloud. Historically, Apple shied away from bug bounties, citing high bids from the government and black markets. And while $200,000 (or even $500,000) is a good payday, it's pennies compared to the upwards of $1 million third parties like Zerodium have paid security researchers to uncover Apple vulnerabilities. In June, Cupertino moved to an unencrypted kernel in iOS 10, allowing enthusiasts and security researchers to look inside, while also increasing device security.

On both phones the antenna strips have been moved to the top and bottom edges.  Alleged leaked picture of the front of the new iPhone, which looks identical to the current model Credit: Letem Svetem The pictures do not offer any shots of the bottom of the phone, where Apple is expected to remove the 3.5mm headphone jack. Nor do the photos elucidate whether the phone will be called the "iPhone 7" or "iPhone 6se". Contrary to some rumours, the front of the phone looks the same as the iPhone 6s, with the device maintaining the switch-like Touch ID home button.  The online store behind the alleged leaks told Letem Svetem that it also has pictures of a blue version. But reports suggest that if Apple is to release an additional colour it will be "Space Black".  The deeper shade could replace the "Space Grey" iPhone Credit: 9to5 Mac Faster processor Pictured below is a new chip that could be used in the next installment of the iPhone series, which could be even more powerful than the high-speed iPad Pro, according to tests leaked in China. The pictures of the chip don't reveal any features of the new chip, but separate leaked screenshots suggest the iPhone 7 could be up to 50 per cent faster than the current model, with 3GB of RAM and a 2.37GHz processor.  Leaked image shows an upgraded "A10" chip that could be used in the upcoming iPhone Credit: Weibo All-glass iPhone Apple moved away from a glass body for its flagship phones when it launched the iPhone 5 back in 2012, which had a metal back. But now the company is reportedly looking to reintroduce the glass chassis to the handset.  One of the manufacturing companies Apple works closely with has been developing an all-glass case for smartphones that is anticipated to be the shell of next year's iPhone.  Foxconn, whose main customer is Apple, has spent the last year designing the glass body, according to Nikkei, which could be used in the 10 year anniversary edition of the iPhone, due to be released in 2017.  The company is a key supplier of metal bodies for the iPhone 6s Plus and SE, as well as the anticipated iPhone 7 Plus. It shares orders for the iPhone 6s and iPhone 7 with Catcher Technology and Jabil.  The news lends some credibility to rumours that the 2017 iPhone will have an all-glass shell and OLED display.  A new Apple wearable?  Apple's patent for an ECG wearable that could be worn on the wrist or ankle Credit: Patently Apple Apple has patented a new wearable device that could be worn on the ankle or wrist and measure electrocardiographic signals for a more accurate heart rate.  While we can't expect such technology to make a real appearance any time soon, Apple does have some changes planned for its Watch. Reports suggest the Silicon Valley giant will release an updated version of the current model, as well as a second generation. Both Watches are expected to have faster processors and be more waterproof. The bigger changes will be reserved for the Apple Watch 2, which could have GPS capability, a barometre and a larger battery. It will probably look similar to the current Watch and will have the same screen size and thickness. As with the iPhone, Apple is expected to be holding back any major Watch design changes until next year.  These could include a front facing camera and independence from the iPhone.  About | The iPhone 7 Release date In typical Apple fashion, the iPhone 7 is likely to be unveiled in early September at an event in California, and go on sale a few days later. Reports suggest it will be held on September 7, with the new products being available from the 16. It is likely to be an action-packed event, with the company expected to unveil a new Apple Watch and MacBook laptops, as well as possibly an upgraded iPad Pro.

Apple took 17.9 percent share in the domestic market in the April-to-June period, down 1.8 percentage points from 19.7 percent a year ago, according to Kantar, a data research subsidiary of WPP. Apple’s share was also behind Huawei’s 25.7 percent and Xiaomi’s 18.5 percent, “While the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus remain the top selling smartphones, pressure from Huawei’s Mate 8 and P9, Xiaomi’s RedMi Note 3 and Mi 5 and Oppo’s R7 has led to increased competition in the (domestic) market, said Tamsin Timpson, a Kantar researcher. Huawei shipped 16.6 million smartphones in the first quarter, taking the lion’s share of China’s smartphone market, followed by Oppo, Xiaomi and Apple, according to another research firm Strategy Analytics. The Chinese market still has great potential for Apple, which is set to release new models next month, Kantar added.

Drake’s summer 2016 chart dominance has put him in rare ­company: Since 1963, only three other artists have led the Billboard 200 and Billboard Hot 100 for at least 10 weeks with an album and ­corresponding single, as the Toronto MC has done with Views and “One Dance” ­(featuring Wizkid and Kyla) this year. But unlike Adele, Santana and Whitney Houston, Drake’s mastery of an emerging platform -- streaming -- paved his way. The numbers speak for themselves: Since its April 29 release, Views has logged the six largest streaming weeks ever for an album’s tracks, and nine of the top 10. Its 20 songs have ­generated 2.1 billion on-demand audio streams through the week ending Aug. 4, according to Nielsen Music, the only album ever to pass the 2 billion mark. And 41 percent of Views’ 3.4 million equivalent album units earned to date have come from streaming units, compared to 42 percent from traditional album sales. The MC’s deal with Apple in mid-2015 aligned him with its digital power, while in May he passed Justin Bieber as the most-streamed artist in Spotify’s history. As streaming continues to become the prevalent revenue and listening model, Drake, 29, has emerged as the format’s de facto Muhammad Ali. How much of that is ­strategy, and how much is luck? Still Summer '16: Drake's 'One Dance' Holds Lead for Song of the Summer “You can’t do this with just any artist; he’s got a great team around him that delivers,” says Apple’s Jimmy Iovine. “And when you’ve got a team like that, you can have things come out at the right time.” Indeed, part of the success is down to good timing: During the first half of 2016, on-demand audio streams increased 97.4 percent year over year, according to Nielsen Music, with R&B/hip-hop leading all genres at 27.4 percent of that total. But Drake is singular in his ability to drive his fan base toward the format. Statistics from MusicWatch provided to Billboard show that 80 percent of Drake’s fans have engaged with him -- in the form of follows, retweets and likes -- on a social media platform; 26 ­percent own music by him; and 19 percent actively follow him (as opposed to merely ­listening) on streaming services. “Drake is very active on social, even sometimes controversial, and when you have an audience that reacts to social, it intersects -- it’s kind of like the 'Kardashian effect,'" says MusicWatch managing partner Russ Crupnick. “But also there’s a constant flow of quality releases, so something is always keeping fans’ interest; he’s active in collaborations with other artists; there’s always something stirring the pot.” Unlike superstars for whom every move is an event, Drake keeps his activity at a constant simmer, peaking at ­strategic moments. Before 2015, he would release tracks every couple of months through his SoundCloud account, resulting in off-cycle platinum hits such as “0 to 100/The Catch Up” and “Hotline Bling” (later included on Views). But since signing his Apple deal, he has shifted his release forum to his weekly OVO Sound radio show on Apple’s Beats 1. Drake Tops Justin Bieber as Most-Streamed Artist on Spotify, Company's Playlists Hit a Billion Weekly Streams “With OVO Sound, Drake is fully ­connecting with subscribers on the streaming service, at least on Apple,” says Rob Markman, manager of artist relations at Genius. “He’s not just delivering music, but delivering events: On Twitter when OVO Sound is airing, you can see people listening and commenting. He’s creating a culture around streaming and embracing it.” “One of Drake’s real gifts is that he doesn’t go away,” says New York Times pop critic Jon Caramanica. “That feels real and also is a strategic choice. No matter what he said last year about ­disappearing to go finish work on Views, there is no actual disappearing.” But perhaps most of all, the genre-spanning diversity of Drake’s music is key, particularly as playlists grow in ­importance. On Spotify, which receives more than 1 billion weekly streams across its in-house playlists, Drake’s music is found on Today’s Top Hits (9.8 ­million followers), Rap Caviar (4 ­million), Teen Party (2.2 ­million) and Are & Be (2.1 ­million), among others. ("He's not afraid to experiment with styles and genres; he can fit on any playlist," Markman says.) And Drake's tendency to lend verses to buzzing songs by emerging artists -- remixing hits by Migos, iLoveMakonnen and Fetty Wap in recent years -- keeps him connected to the younger demographic that represents the core of on-demand streaming's users. “You have to consider where Drake’s fans are,” adds Caramanica. “His idea of soundtracking actually lines up very neatly with a streaming economy, where you don’t have to go dig and find ­something -- this thing is there for you in the moment when you need it. Drake is the titan of that.” A version of this article originally appeared in the Aug. 20 issue of Billboard.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Stumbleupon Whatsapp Email Ads by Google For the second time this year, you’ve dropped your iPhone, causing your screen to crack like an unswept spiders web. You’re not that concerned. Like many people, you bought AppleCare+ when you picked up your brand-new handset at the Apple Store. This gives you up to two replacement devices for a $99 deductible AppleCare: What Are Your Options & Is It Really Worth It? AppleCare: What Are Your Options & Is It Really Worth It? High customer satisfaction ratings and a large network of stores capable of performing certain repairs on-site give AppleCare the edge over the average warranty - but are the benefits really worth the price? Read More . But what if you could fix your iPhone yourself Something Broken? Learn To Fix Anything With These 4 Websites Something Broken? Learn To Fix Anything With These 4 Websites You can spend hundreds of dollars to have a professional help you out, or you can learn how to fix it yourself for the cost of some tools and a couple hours of work. Read More ? What does it take to become a certified Apple repairman? And is it worth pursuing as a career? Getting Started as an AppleCare Technician Like most things in the iWorld, getting qualified as an AppleCare technician is incredibly expensive. Members of the general public have to purchase the training material that teaches you how to diagnose and repair iDevices. This is bought from the Apple Store for $299.00. Those already employed at an Apple-authorized service facility get it through their workplace. Although this is quite expensive, it’s worth emphasizing that this is the whole AppleCare training package, and includes courses on Mac repair and maintenance. If you want to just become an Apple Certified iOS Technician (ACiT), you only need to pay attention to a fraction of the material. This is listed on the Apple website. Then, you’ve got to learn it, and I don’t mean “get familiar with it” but really learn it. If you want to call yourself an AppleCare-certified technician, you’ve got to become an expert. This makes sense. Apple is effectively staking their reputation on your ability, and you’ll have to be able to independently diagnose problems, use diagnostic tools, and fix other people’s hardware. Ads by Google Once you’re confident that you know the material, you can then take your ACiT exams. There are two you’ll have to take – the Apple Service Fundamentals Exam (SVC-16A), and ACiT 2016 iOS Service Certification Exam (iOS-16A). These are grueling two-hour ordeals, and you need to score at least 80% on each exam in order to pass. On top of that, the Apple Service Fundamentals Exam contains two separate sections on electrostatic discharge precautions Your Sneakers Can Kill Your Computer: How Static Electricity Works [MakeUseOf Explains] Your Sneakers Can Kill Your Computer: How Static Electricity Works [MakeUseOf Explains] Static electricity is the number one computer hardware killer, and its everywhere!

Candidates will have to score at least 10 out of 12 on each section in order to pass the exam. The cost to take these exams depends on the country you plan to take them in. In the US, it’s $150 each, or $300 overall. If you fail the exam, you’ll have to pay to retake it. Pearson VUE administers the exams online. This means you don’t have to make the effort to go to one of their testing centers, which are typically based in nondescript office buildings or on industrial estates. The test itself is open-book, and you’re allowed to use whatever resource you want in order to answer the questions. Candidates are encouraged to use Apple references to help them answer the exam questions. You’ll then get your results on the spot. If you failed, my commiserations. These exams are hard and have a very low threshold for failure. You should get some feedback on the areas you were weakest on. Go back, study harder, and try again — but keep in mind it could be an expensive cycle if you keep failing the exam. If you passed, congratulations. You’ve got an incredible career ahead of you, and will now be a more enticing hire for SSAs (Self-Servicing Accounts – these are institutions and universities which Apple allows to service its own hardware under warranty), as well as AASPs (Apple Authorized Service Providers). How To Become An Apple Genius In the retail world, the most coveted jobs are at the Apple Store. For a great many people, Apple is a religion, and getting a job with them is akin to joining the priesthood. One of the most respected jobs you can get at Apple Retail is as a Genius. According to GlassDoor’s review system, this pays on average $20.62 per hour, with raises that keep up with inflation. For a retail job, that’s pretty reasonable money. As a result, competition is fierce. According to cultofmac.com, it can take months for Apple Retail to call a candidate in for an interview. The same article says that “job advertisements posted by Apple have usually already been filled about 80% of the time by internal candidates before they even go up.” This is because of an internal policy which says that all applications must be posted, even those that have been filled or promised to someone.  Before you start work as a Genius, you must first go through a grueling 14-day bootcamp, where you learn everything from how to diagnose broken machines Fix Your Own Mac: A Troubleshooting Guide Fix Your Own Mac: A Troubleshooting Guide Apple is known for having great customer service and repair technicians, but if you're no longer under warranty that expertise doesn't come cheap. Why not try troubleshooting your own Mac first next time? Read More , to interpersonal and customer service skills. In 2012, the Genius Training manual was leaked to Gizmodo’s Sam Biddle. It’s obvious from reading it that Apple emphasizes a standard level of customer service above pure technical skills. There are other benefits to working from the Apple Store. Of course, you get significant discounts on hardware. According to Business Insider, this can be as much as $500 off the cost of a new Mac (excluding the super cheap Mac Mini, obviously), or $250 off an iPad. There’s also a liberal work culture. As long as you’re wearing your Apple-issued T-shirt and nametag, you can wear pretty whatever you want. A prominent tattoo or facial piercing isn’t grounds for dismissal like in some jobs.

Learn To Fix It Yourself It’s also possible to fix your own equipment without having to embark upon a new career or undertaking lengthy and expensive training. Unlike Apple’s latest laptops, iDevices are surprisingly fixable, especially when compared to recent devices from HTC and Samsung. A plentiful supply of official and third-party spare parts are available online, so if you’re feeling confident you can skip the extensive training regimen and have a go yourself. Your first port of call should be iFixit, which has repair tutorials for a variety of devices, including iPhones and iPads. It also sells the tools you’ll need, as well as a variety replacement components. Fair warning though, if you go down this path, you risk damaging your device, and you’ll void any warranty (or AppleCare policy) that covers your device. Are you tempted to get Apple-certified? Is “Genius” your ideal job title?

I did pay for the apple care technician training for 299+ taxes. After I studied the material and paid 20 dollars for each exam on Pearsonvue. It is open book, but you have to pass with 80% and above. A lot higher than CompTIA exams. I am talking about the SVC-16A and the MAC-16A and now I am ACMT. I am going to take the ACit and it shows for me at 20 dollars for me. I don't know if its to detter other people. I have the receipts to prove 20 dollars per exam. Book for A+ = 30.00 Exam 901 = 199.00 Exam 902 = 179.99 (I paid for a discounted voucher from Comptia) Total 408.99 AppleCare Tech Training 299.99+taxes SVC-16A = 20.00 MAC-16A = 20.00 iOS-16A = 20.00 about 359.95 Sounds like you only read and not gone through the process.

That included CVS, who today is launching their own mobile payment service to compete with Apple Pay, Android Pay, and Samsung Pay. CVS Pay is a new mobile payment service for CVS Pharmacy stores. Built into the CVS Pharmacy app, CVS Pay works by letting a customer add their debit or credit cards to the app and then showing the app’s barcode to a cashier at checkout. The cashier scans the barcode, and after ringing up the items, the customer selects the payment method that they’d like to use in the app. The service also works in the drive-thru using a pickup number. CVS Pay also integrates prescription pickup and CVS’s ExtraCare loyalty program into your barcode scan. CVS says that its mobile payment service is now live in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Delaware. A nationwide rollout is slated for later in 2016. CVS Pay works on Android and iOS and supports MasterCard, Visa, Discover, and American Express as well as debit, Health Savings Account, and Flexible Spending Account cards. Apple, Google, and Samsung already have established mobile payment solutions, but the mobile payments game is still young, and CVS wants to see if it can gain traction with its own service rather than relying on services from other companies. We’ll have to wait and see if the strategy works out for them, but if you’re in one of the markets where CVS Pay is now live, you can go give it a try for yourself right now.

For starters, Apple has made more than its fair share of missteps when it comes to software in recent memory. From the bug-plagued roll out of Apple Maps to the frustrating, confusing and error-prone UI that accompanied the launch of Apple Music, no one would argue that Apple's software track record is flawless. DON'T MISS: One of Apple’s biggest wholesale partners is already taking iPhone 7 preorders Earlier this year, venerable tech journalist Walt Mossberg penned a widely circulated article where he argued that there has been a discernible decline in both quality and reliability across the entirety of Apple's software platforms. "In the last couple of years,” Mossberg wrote, “I’ve noticed a gradual degradation in the quality and reliability of Apple’s core apps, on both the mobile iOS operating system and its Mac OS X platform. It’s almost as if the tech giant has taken its eye off the ball when it comes to these core software products, while it pursues big new dreams, like smartwatches and cars.” Mossberg's post predictably triggered a contentious debate between those who were quick to pile on Apple based on their own software frustrations and those who felt that the narrative regarding the quality of Apple software was in dire need of a more reasoned perspective. For those in the second group, the following arguments were frequently raised to defend Apple: The software Apple ships today is incredibly more advanced than anything else to have ever come out of 1 Infinite Loop. Not only that, but some of the code Apple releases comprises some of the most advanced software on the planet. Furthermore, more people today are using Apple products than ever before, often in ways that would have seemed the stuff of science-fiction even eight years ago. Taken together, the argument goes that Apple's software, on the whole, is just fine and that we just hear more about perceived declines in software quality because Apple's user base has grown by leaps and bounds. Personally, I think it's impossible to deny that Apple's software could use a bit of refining; but the idea that Apple's software quality is much worse today than it was, say, two or even five years ago has always seemed like a reach to me. Having said all that, Apple executives Eddy Cue and Craig Federighi addressed this topic head-on as part of a wide-ranging interview the pair recently conducted with Fast Company. When asked about the idea that Apple software has more problems than in years past, Cue responded: Well, there’s more people, there’s more devices, and there’s more communications available. I actually think our products have fewer mistakes than they did in the past, and our data shows that. But, look, I tell this to my team all the time. When we were the Mac company, if we impacted 1% of our customers, it was measured in thousands. Now if we impact 1% of our customers, it’s measured in tens of millions. That’s a problem, right—things are going to be perceived differently. Our products are way better than they used to be, but there’s a higher bar, and I’m okay with that. I think that is why we’re here. That’s why I get up every day. I like that people have high expectations of us, and that they care about little things that bother them, which, in a lot of products, they wouldn’t bother about. With other companies, you think, that’s about as good as it’s going to be. With us, you want perfection; you want it to be the best. And we want that. Federighi, meanwhile, added the following: A world where people do not care about the quality of their experience is not a good world for Apple. A world where people care about those details and want to complain about them is the world where our values shine. That is our obsession. If people were like, "That’s good enough for me" . . . well, there are a lot of people who can provide that kind of experience. I think that we are focused on working hard every day to make it better. We make mistakes, things get out there, but we work incredibly hard to make things better and better. The bar does keep going up. The number of things you expect from your phone and your computer and the way they interact, and the cloud and services and the way the Internet works with them, the level of complexity goes up and up. But we’re committed to getting better and better, faster than it gets harder and harder. As a final point, it's worth pointing out that Federighi a few months bag pointed out that Apple's core iOS apps in iOS 9.0 were less prone to crashing than the most mature iteration of iOS 8.x."

That hype has gotten to a level that one Chinese wholesaler is willing to risk making Apple very upset by putting the phone up for pre-order. That takes guts, especially when the worst-case result could be as bad as Apple pulling iPhone 7 distribution deals with the wholesaler. Spotted by one eagle-eyed Twitter user, Leleda – which is China’s largest authorized Apple wholesaler – has opened up pre-orders for the new device nearly a month before Apple is suspected to even reveal the new phone. The listing by Leleda seems to suggest that the phone will indeed be called iPhone 7 when it arrives, meaning Apple may not be abandoning its traditional naming conventions with this latest installment. Though Apple has remained tight-lipped on the iPhone 7, some of the most prevalent rumors about the device claim that it’ll be arriving without a headphone jack, which is one that has left many iPhone users scratching their heads. More recent rumors indicate that the iPhone 7 could be missing a physical home button when it does appear, instead opting for a force touch home button that offers different functions depending on the intensity with which it’s pressed. Apple is expected to reveal the iPhone 7 at an event that could take place as early as September 7. It’s there we’ll see if any of these many rumors hold true, and we’ll presumably be getting a solid release date for the device once and for all. As for these early pre-orders? If you’re in China you can give it a try, but it’s probably best to wait until Apple drops some official details on the iPhone 7 before you jump to reserve one.

By Christian Zibreg, Aug 11, 2016 Tweet 8 Comments With no official invites going out yet, speculation continues to mount as to when Apple might be holding a media event to announce the next iPhone. According to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are going to be unveiled at an event tentatively scheduled for Wednesday, September 7, less than four weeks from today. His report yesterday about the next MacBook Pro with an OLED touch strip mentions as a side-note that the refreshed notebooks “aren’t likely to debut at an event currently scheduled for September 7 to introduce next-generation versions of the iPhone”. The company has not officially announced the September 7 date. An Apple spokesperson declined to comment. Although the claim is attributed to one of the “people familiar with the matter”, which is too often an euphemism for the ”rumor-mill,” Gurman is a well-connected Apple reporter who cut his teeth at 9to5Mac so there’s no reason to call his statement into question. On the other hand, he may have simply extrapolated the launch event date from prolific leakster Evan Blass’s tweet saying the forthcoming phones will hit retail stores on Friday, September 16, with pre-orders beginning on Friday, September 9. Confirmed: Pre-orders start on the 9th. You can extrapolate the launch event date from there. https://t.co/gwoPzIM1dI — Evan Blass (@evleaks) July 28, 2016 If accurate, such a schedule is somewhat unusual as it leaves Apple with just seven days to collect pre-orders for the new phones, before they land on store shelves. In the past, pre-orders for new iPhone models usually lasted for two weeks. For context, the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus were introduced on Wednesday, September 9, 2015. Apple started taking pre-orders for the devices on Saturday, September 12, ahead of their retail availability on Friday, September 25. Were Apple to collect pre-orders for the new phones during the usual two-week window between the announcement and launch—and assuming Blass’s September 16 retail availability claim is accurate—then the press event should happen on Tuesday, September 1. Apple usually sends out invites about two weeks before actual launch events so we’re expecting official confirmation early next week. So, what do you guys think? When’s iPhone 7 event going to take place, on the 1st or the 7th? Conventional wisdom tells me September 1, but my money is on the 7th.

Eliijah Moss If the rumors are correct, then the new phones will spot 3gb of rams. Not sure how much of that is true, but hey. We might not even realize any changes that’s under the hood. lou111 guess what… 🙂 the “next iPhones” will always have “more ram” and “faster chip” than older one 🙂 Jamessmooth I like sept 1, but my money is on Gurman. Mike Colacone Saal why is it unusual?

According to Doll’s LinkedIn profile, he will work in the company’s health software department. Doll apparently rejoined Apple last month as a “director of health software engineering” (via Bloomberg). Doll originally worked at Apple from 2003 to 2009 as a software engineer. At first, he was a pro applications software engineer, though he later shifted his focus to developing an operating system for the iPhone. In 2009, however, a year after the App Store launch, Doll left Apple to co-found the popular news app Flipboard. With iOS 9, Apple introduced its own News app, which Flipboard quickly responded to by noting similarities with the service and its own apps. Flipboard CEO Mike McCue seemed intent on keeping an amicable relationship with Apple, though, noting that it wasn’t a “winner take all” situation. Nevertheless, Doll departed Flipboard last September as part of a bigger exodus of executives. Doll is not the first health/fitness hire Apple has made in recent years. In 2014, Apple was hiring a multitude of higher-ups from the medical sensor field, while that same year it also hired a pair of key Nike FuelBand engineers. Those hires followed Nike FuelBand developer and fitness expert Jay Blahnik joining Apple. Apple has also hired at least one employee with a focus on FDA approvals and product testing. A vague report earlier this week claimed that Apple is working on a “killer device” in the health field that will be released sometime next year. The report, however, gave no specifics on what the device will be capable of other than tracking blood sugar and heart-rate. The suggestion of a standalone health product makes sense, seeing that Tim Cook said last year that future health products would separate from the Watch in an effort to avoid FDA approvals slowing the pace of Watch innovation. Tim Cook has increasingly touted the fitness and wellness capabilities of Apple’s product lineup, making a handful of improvements to the features with the upcoming launch of iOS 10 and watchOS 3.

Thursday, August 11, 2016 · 10:35 am · 11 Comments “The day before Apple reported earnings,an analyst came out with a bold statement and recommended investors sell Apple before going into earnings on July 26. He also cut his price target from $110 per share down to $85 per share with a Sell rating slapped on for good measure. He said, ‘Apple has peaked under the leadership of CEO Tim Cook,'” Jay Somaney writes for Forbes. “I am not a fan of Tim Cook’s leadership skills either however that research report seemed unduly harsh as far as the rating and price target.” “The next day, Apple reported earnings and investors realized that things were not as bad as the sellsiders were expecting and the guidance was even slightly higher which is very atypical of Apple’s usual subdued forecasts,” Somaney writes. “Apple shares are up almost 11.5% in the two weeks or so since that report and have not looked back. So, the question for investors is whether the worst is behind us and is Apple stock ready to continue climbing higher into the launch of the iPhone7 in early September?” Apple Analysts are “now sheepishly trying to put out optimistic reports on Apple post its June quarter results and combined with the success of Tim Cook’s trip to India and China, things for Apple and its investors have finally started looking up, no?” Somaney writes. “Finally, maybe, just maybe, peak Apple was just a pipe dream for the dark side (shorts)?” Read more in the full article here.

Michael Thursday, August 11, 2016 - 4:23 pm · Reply Tim Cook is working very hard to make the company sustainable after growing at such a rapid pace over the past several years. Sorry but when you are growing that fast it is far more difficult to “innovate”. Steve Jobs’ Apple was hailed as “innovative” because they were able to change directions on a dime. They were a fraction of the size they are now with a user base an order of magnitude smaller. More effort has to be put into getting the product into the customers hands than ever before. They’re not making millions of products, they’re producing hundreds of millions of them. Furthermore, Tim Cook is passionate and speaks about EVERYONE’s rights regarding, privacy, security, equality, safety, etc. It’s your feeble homophobic mind that you ONLY see the “gay” issue. He’s also extremely passionate about education, the environment, AND customer satisfaction (he mentions this all the time). veritas Friday, August 12, 2016 - 10:52 am · Reply Me thinks thou dost protest too much… Come out of the closet, it’s ok.

As far as I’m concerned they never lost it. alanaudio Thursday, August 11, 2016 - 11:19 am · Reply It’s always the same story. The analysts get it hopelessly wrong, but somehow it’s Apple’s fault. The analysts were saying that Tin Cook and Apple had lost their mojo and therefore the company performance was expected to decline. When the results were announced and demonstrated that Apple had been doing quite nicely after all, the analysts try to claim that it’s down to Apple suddenly getting it’s mojo back. It may have escaped the attention of the analysts ( and let’s be fair, much does escape their attention ), but if the results for the last three months were OK, then that mojo must have ‘returned’ more than three months ago without the analysts even noticing, or to put it another way, the mojo was there all along, but completely unseen by those whose job it is to spot such things. Joe Thursday, August 11, 2016 - 11:35 am · Reply He said, “Apple has peaked under the leadership of CEO Tim Cook.” Well, he nailed that part. iPhone sales were down, iPad sales were down, Mac sales were down. With all of this bad news, who could have predicted that the price of Apple stock would go up? What the analyst failed to do was predict how well Apple could spin all the bad news. With Tim Cook at the helm, it is going to get harder and harder to spin. peterblood71 Thursday, August 11, 2016 - 4:24 pm · Reply Only for the repetitious idjit trolls like you. jambro Thursday, August 11, 2016 - 2:04 pm · Reply Cook is lost without Jobs as Captain. Jobs was passionate about making great products. Cook is passionate about social and gay issues and ignores Apple. So yeah, Apple is lost. peterblood71 Thursday, August 11, 2016 - 4:26 pm · Reply Well until they’re miraculously “found” again with new products, updates and soaring sales, eh?

That time is now. Coming a month or so before the next iPhone release, many people want to know how the current-year Galaxy Note sizes up with the latest iPhone Plus – which, at this point, is going on a year old. So be sure to add many grains of salt: It's the 2016 Samsung Galaxy Note 7 vs. the 2015 iPhone 6s Plus. Size We aren't sure if it's more about how impressive it is that Samsung squeezed a big screen into a smaller device, or how unimpressive it is that Apple, a company known for minimal and efficient design, keeps releasing phones with so much space wasted on "chin" and "forehead." Despite having the bigger screen, the Galaxy Note 7 comes out 3 percent shorter and 5 percent narrower than the iPhone 6s Plus. Weight The smaller Note 7 also comes out 12 percent lighter. Build We were impressed with the Note 7's build at our event hands-on. On paper, it's the same glass and aluminum design Samsung has been using on its flagships since the Galaxy S6, but in hand this one feels better than ever, with rounded edges that could be easily mistaken for an all-glass build. Colors You have four color options for each phone. Display size The Galaxy Note 7 has a 7 percent bigger screen than the iPhone – and, again, remember that the Note is still the smaller handset. Display resolution The Note 7's screen is also 29 percent sharper, based on pixel density. The iPhone's 1080p screen still looks great, but the Galaxy's QHD resolution gives it an extra eye candy pop. HDR display Samsung's new screen is also capable of displaying HDR content, with a wide range between the lightest lights and the darkest darks. Display type It's the familiar AMOLED vs. IPS on the display panel front. Always-on display The Note 7 gives you the option of leaving its screen on while it sits on your desk, showing things like time, date and number of text messages on an otherwise black display. Curved display Unless you count the Galaxy Note Edge from two years ago, the Note 7 is the first primary Galaxy Note flagship with a curved screen. Those curves slope off a bit closer to the edge than on Samsung's previous Edge phones, though, combining with the curved back to give it that smooth rounded-edge feel. Stylus It wouldn't be a Galaxy Note without the S Pen stylus. This year the stylus is narrower, doubles its levels of pressure sensitivity over the last two models and gets its own IP68 water resistance. Samsung also added its annual set of new software-based features, including a quick translate option that lets you instantly convert a word from one language to another (just by hovering the pen over it), a GIF creation tool and a magnification tool. Pressure-sensitive display Apple's 3D Touch, which gives you iOS shortcuts by pressing deeper on the screen, has yet to be widely copied on the Android side of the aisle. Iris scanner The Galaxy Note 7 is the first mainstream flagship that lets you unlock it with your eyes. Fingerprint sensors, which require next to no effort, do most of the same things the iris scanner does, though, so we're skeptical about whether this neat-sounding new trick is something you'll want to go out of your way to get. Fingerprint sensor In addition to the iris scanner, the Note still keeps its fingerprint sensor home button as a backup. Water resistance This is the first Galaxy Note to have water resistance. Its IP68 rating means it can soak continuously in 1 m (3.3 ft) of water. Camera megapixels On paper, camera resolutions are identical. But if the new Note ends up using the same sensor as the Galaxy S7 pair (it looks like it does), then it will have the better rear camera. As we said at the top, though, that's hardly surprising given the Note is a year-newer flagship. Camera aperture (rear) Part of Samsung's superior camera quality is its low-light shooting prowess, which is largely tied to its wider aperture. OIS Both of these handsets have Optical Image Stabilization. Battery The Note 7 has a 27 percent bigger battery, which might suggest longer battery life, but we'll wait for our review benchmark before saying anything definitive on that front. Fast charging If there's one feature we think Apple "needs" to add with its next iPhones, it's some form of fast-charging. This has been a huge advantage for Android flagships for the last two years. Wireless charging The Note 7 also gives you the option of charging wirelessly. Processor The Note 7's Snapdragon 820 benchmarks a bit faster than the A9 in the 6s series, but we wouldn't be surprised if the iPhone 7 ended up being a little faster than the new Note, which is using an early 2016 CPU. RAM The Note doubles the iPhone's RAM, though iOS' excellent memory management means it still gives you silky-smooth multitasking. Storage The Note 7 quadruples the entry-level iPhone's storage. Actually, you can scratch what we said a minute ago: The single biggest feature the next iPhone needs is more than a measly 16 GB storage in the base-level tier. MicroSD The Galaxy also lets you augment its internal storage by popping in a microSD card. Mobile payments Both phones let you pay for stuff by holding the handsets up to a terminal. But Samsung Pay has an advantage over Apple Pay, in that Samsung's service can simulate the swiping of a credit card at regular payment stations that don't support Apple's required NFC. Gear VR Apple has yet to toy with the world of virtual reality (at least publicly). The Note 7 unlocks the best selection of mobile VR apps, once you plug it into Samsung's latest Gear VR. Software The Galaxy Note 7 launches with Android Marshmallow (with a generous layer of Samsung TouchWiz on top), but will likely get Android Nougat not too terribly long after its public release. The iPhone runs iOS 9 until next month, when iOS 10 launches. Release The Note 7 is up for pre-order now, and hits store shelves on August 19. This is a terrible time to buy the iPhone 6s Plus, at least at anything close to full price. A month from now, we should already know about the next pair of iPhones. Starting price (full retail) At this point, this is our biggest concern about the Note 7. In a world where you can buy a high-end flagship for US$399, Samsung actually jacked up the Note's price by $100. Is the justification the iris scanner? Water resistance? Extra storage? It's not that the Note didn't strike us as a terrific, ultra-premium phone in our event demo, it's more that its quality to price ratio could hold back our overall recommendation.

(AAPL) and Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) BABA and NVDA look ready to run higher, but keep an eye on APPL Aug 11, 2016, 10:28 am EST  |  By Johnson Research Group     The S&P 500’s ability to move above the top of its range is causing some concern among traders, especially since this August rally has gone against the historically weak seasonality that the month is well-known for. This morning’s technical landscape is starting to fill up with a number of potentially bullish breakouts, although there is one popular stock that the short-term technicals are starting to concern us. The Trinity of Technology for today includes two bulls and one bear: Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE:BABA), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA) Alibaba released a positive earnings report this morning, sending shares about 5% higher in the premarket trading. The shares have been entrenched in a technically strengthening rally that kicked-off in June and now has shares of the online retailer moving to their highest point in the last year. 7 Dividend-Paying Energy Stocks to Tap Into Now! What is more interesting about the move in the shares is that they broke above their top Bollinger Band yesterday, ahead of earnings. It suggests that the market was “buying the rumor,” which can sometimes be bad, but not likely here. Alibaba stock has a large amount of short interest positioned against it, which makes the Bollinger Band break increasingly bullish as the shorts are now facing growing losses. Technical analysts love it when a bullish chart forms and short interest is high, as it triggers a short covering rally. Right now, the charts look open to $104 for Alibaba shares. Apple Inc. (AAPL) Apple Inc. is on the other side of our list today. The stock has done well lately, rallying more than 17% from its June lows, but the rally has extended Apple shares to a likely turning point. Apple stock entered oversold territory in early August, and for a while looked like the shares would defy gravity. Now, we’re seeing a slowdown in the momentum of the shares at the same time that it continues to hover in oversold territory. In Apple’s case, traders may be holding on a while longer, as the company will reveal their newest products in about a month, but you have to remember that their “reveals” have under-impressed investors. Apple shares are trading just below their April highs that were around $110, but the momentum is shifting and trader will start to sweat a little and think about locking in a nice gain from the shares’ short-term bull run. In addition to April highs, Apple stock will face pressure from its 20-month moving average, which is at $112 and declining. For now, the technical balance of power is moving in favor of the Apple bears, though you’ll have a chance to trade this on bullishly soon. Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Nvidia is preparing their earnings release for this afternoon after the close. This stock has been a juggernaut in the market with a whopping 148% in gains over the last 12 months. The growth has been steady, except for when they announce earnings, when Nvidia shares tend to jump higher. We just preached the dangers of an overbought stock, but in Nvidia’s case overbought can and has led to even more overbought situations. As pointed out, this stock has defied gravity. Alibaba: Earnings Propel BABA Stock to New Highs The stock pulled back from the $60 level over the last few days, which is good as it suggests that some traders are paring back positions ahead of the report instead of buying the rumor. Either way, we’re interested in this stock from a technical perspective. An earnings miss this afternoon will cause a quick reversal and pullback to the $52 level, at which point the technical traders will step in at the 50-day support. A beat will continue the march higher into fresh new high territory. As of this writing, the Johnson Research Group did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Bloomberg first caught wind of Doll’s re-hiring this morning, based on his recently updated LinkedIn profile revealing his new position at Apple: Director of Health Software Engineering. He starter at Apple last month, as per LinkedIn, which doesn’t expand further on his role. During his nearly-six-year tenure at the Cupertino firm as Senior iPhone Engineer from 2003 to 2009, he helped develop the original iPhone’s operating system before leaving the company to co-found Flipboard with Mike McCue. He left Flipboard in September 2015. Apple recently hired Sage Bionetworks founder and Merck & Co. veteran Stephen Friend and former Nest Labs technology chief Yoky Matsuoka, who joined the company’s growing health team. According to industry sources who recently spoke with Taiwan’s Economic Daily News, Apple is working on a “killer new health-tracking gadget” that will use 3D Touch, debut in 2017 and “set off a new whirlwind” within the technology industry.

(Reuters/Stephen Lam) Share Written by Joon Ian Wong Obsession Messaging August 11, 2016 Apple’s App Store catalogue is exploding, and this will only strengthen the hold existing top apps have over users. The number of apps hosted on Apple’s platform is set to increase by 50% this year, from just over 2 million, according to estimates by research firm Sensor Tower. By 2020, the total number of apps will hit 5 million, or more than double the current amount. Back in 2009, the App Store had just 5,000 apps. It was relatively easy for users to browse Apple’s categories and find the ones they wanted to install. The picture today is very different. Smartphone users already devote almost all their time on their devices to just their top five apps, according to ComScore. Half a user’s time on her smartphone is spent in just one app, the same ComScore survey found. Here’s what that looks like charted: There’s a good chance that those top five apps belong to either Facebook or Google, although Google Play isn’t available to Apple’s iOS users, since it’s a portal for Android apps. Apple has taken note of the crowded app landscape. It’s opening up new ways for app publishers to make money, like through subscriptions. It’s also creating more fine-grained categories, like “Shopping,” and letting publishers advertise their wares within the App Store. Sensor Tower thinks an artificial intelligence-powered App Store assistant may be one solution Apple could try out in its effort to spread user attention across millions more apps in the near future. In the meantime, publishers must think of creative ways to get in front of users, including sneaking under the radar with novel keyboards, or hooking them with funny or glamorous stickers, as Kim Kardashian’s Kimoji app has demonstrated.

Next year’s iPhone 8 will have a damage-resistant glass face on one or both edges of the handset and replace physical buttons with digital ones that vary depending on which features in use, according to an Apple patent released to the public on Tuesday. “Edge displays may alternatively function as virtual buttons, virtual switches, or informational displays that are supplemental to front side displays,” as it states in the patent description. The innovations in Apple’s patent go beyond the curved screen and virtual side buttons of the Samsung Galaxy Edge, making the touch sensitive virtual side-display buttons interactive. And the patent illustrations suggest that if the phone is playing music, the sidewall screen would display track information; if the camera function is activated, the sidewall would display photo options.  These sort of technological leaps would seem to be a necessity for Apple, which is confronting weaker demand and stiffer competition from its top rival Samsung and China’s Huawei Technology. The company’s 13-year streak of consecutive quarterly growth ended in March, due largely to flagging iPhone sales, and its third quarter revenue continued this trend, with a 15-percent decline. And though the iPhone 7 will give a boost to Apple’s holiday sales, the handset is basically serving as a bridge to next year’s expected iPhone overhaul. There is speculation those changes could go beyond what’s shown in the patent and possibly result in an “all-glass” model in which every face is interactive. A source in Taiwan familiar with Apple’s supply chain said Hon Hai Precision Industry (aka Foxconn), Apple’s primary supplier, is developing a wrap-around glass smartphone case, which fuels the rumors that Apple is considering significant changes to its current flat, front-facing damage-resistant glass display. “Foxconn has been trying glass chassis since last year,” the source told Nikkei Asian Review. Foxconn’s all-glass chassis may or may not be part of this 10th anniversary iPhone reset, but regardless other innovations should be. Earlier this year, Gorilla Glass-maker Corning Inc. announced it had developed a way to print high-resolution images directly onto the smooth surface of its damage-resistant sheet glass. This would give Apple the ability, as its sidewall-display patent describes, to use “printed or painted masks” to distinguish sidewall display icons. For example, the current volume-control buttons could be replaced by touch-screen buttons and a printed layer on the glass could visually separate them from the virtual buttons that shift as users switch between different iPhone functions. In a sense, whether the iPhone gets the “all-glass” upgrade or merely a raft of new features on its 10th birthday may not matter — the buzz may be enough to make consumers hang on to their current phones until they see what Apple has in store.   More Angelo Young.

What makes the strip interesting is that it will change the keys available to you to reflect the context, so if you are in a movie-editing app you may be presented with a different set of Function keys than you’ll find in iTunes, and these will change again if you enter a different app.” “The report also claims Touch ID support in these machines. This will enable Apple Pay, online payments and support for third party apps supporting Touch ID authorization,” Evans writes. “Will Apple create API’s to enable Mac support for such features ported over from iOS? Not only this, but is Apple planning to introduce Touch ID support across every Mac, if so, how? (Apple Watch may be one way to enable such features through older Macs).” “The report adds: ‘The display also allows Apple to add new buttons via software updates rather than through more expensive, slower hardware refreshes,'” Evans writes. “This rather begs the question of what kind of additional control elements the company intends deploying in Macs (A Siri key, for example?)” Read more in the full article here. MacDailyNews Take: We would expect Apple to provide developers with API access to such a touch strip, so developers can make app-specific use of that input area. And, yes, a Siri softkey would be a welcome addition. These Mac notebooks are going to be very desirable!

While I assume they will open the touch bar up to third party developers, I’m guessing adoption will be slow and spotty, like Force Touch on iOS, which makes for a disappointing experience. critic2 Thursday, August 11, 2016 - 10:20 am · Reply Hopefully these keys are user definable Herself Thursday, August 11, 2016 - 12:23 pm · Reply User-definable keyboard shortcuts are built into Mac OS and into certain applications I use lots, like Excel and BBEdit. That functionality allows me to really fly when working with a full-sized keyboard. The only drawback is trying to recall my assignments of command-shift-Fn3, and similar scrinchers after a long drought away from the keyboard. Displaying text or icons solves that memory problem. Come to think of it, the emergence of the Graphical User Interface solved an almost identical problem of trying to remember commands and their syntax in DOS and other command-line interfaces. There were cheat sheets taped all over the desk and monitor to help with that—inelegant, at best. Bo Thursday, August 11, 2016 - 10:21 am · Reply Next put OLED notification or static display panels in the palm rest areas. Hey, it is called a MacBook “PRO” … geo pet Thursday, August 11, 2016 - 1:16 pm · Reply In the late 1970s, HP used softkeys in their desktop computers. Instead of the labels on the keys changing, the bottom of the screen would remind users what the functions did. Of course, it’s more elegant to have the key labels change and it saves screen space, but this idea is certainly not new. trondude Thursday, August 11, 2016 - 2:21 pm · Reply I don’t see the actual need for this, what are they trying to do, copy the stupid Galaxy edge?

Billboard The New Pioneers: Chance the Rapper Is One of the Hottest Acts in Music, Has a Top 10 Album and His Own Festival -- All Without a Label or Physical Release American Music Awards News Hot 100 Billboard 200 Charts Videos “I don’t make the type of raps where I lecture on how good I am or how I stand. I do flex a lot on being independent so other people in positions like mine see the options,” says Chance, photographed July 20 at The F Stop Studio in Chicago. Styling by Whitney Middleton.  Ramona Rosales The New Pioneers: Chance the Rapper Is One of the Hottest Acts in Music, Has a Top 10 Album and His Own Festival -- All Without a Label or Physical Release by Ben Austen August 11, 2016, 8:59am EDT Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Holed up at a recording studio in Chicago’s Near North Side, Chancelor Bennett — the local phenomenon known as Chance the Rapper — is in wise-old-man mode. Chance, 23, holds a cigarette aloft in one hand, a pen in the other, his narrow shoulders hunched over a notebook. It’s late on a Saturday night in July, and he has been working for hours, writing a song he will perform as a tribute to Muhammad Ali during the finale of the ESPY Awards, to be held in Los Angeles in a couple of days. “When I write, I work off of a theme, an emotion, a narrative — thinking of it and then expounding on it,” says Chance. “I was trying to rap with mad boxing metaphors, being very literal. It was cheesy.” Watch Chance the Rapper Perform Moving Tribute to Muhammad Ali at the ESPY Awards So instead Chance imagines the song as a letter written by his mother, Lisa, to Ali. As a girl on the South Side, she lived near the boxing legend, and she often has recounted how she braved the walk to his front door only to discover that he was out of town. But the letter isn’t right either. Chance decides the song needs to be “more sort of liturgical” after his thoughts turn to his father, Ken, a political operative who has been a deputy assistant to President Obama and more recently Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel’s deputy chief of staff. “I see so much of my dad in Ali,” says Chance. “Their voices, the physicality of them, their vulnerability.” Chance’s engineer Jeff Lane has been waiting for five hours to record the completed verses. He nods admiringly at Chance grinding inside the sound booth: “You think Rihanna does this?” Chance the Rapper: The Billboard Photo Shoot If it seems odd that a rapper who calls himself Lil Chano From 79th would be chosen to eulogize THE GREATEST, on primetime network TV, in front of the world’s reigning celebrity athletes, then consider how Chance has become an iconoclast in his own right. He emerged as 2016’s most highly praised rapper, an heir to Kanye West (his mentor) and Kendrick Lamar (who in a recent issue of this magazine named Chance as a favorite MC), all without signing a record deal or even charging money for a single song. He performed on Saturday Night Live as the show’s first-ever unsigned musical guest in December 2015, then returned to the show two months later with West, delivering a guest verse on the latter’s “Ultralight Beam” that was hailed as a poetic knockout. (It went, in part, “You can feel the lyrics, the spirit coming in Braille/Tubman of the underground, come and follow the trail.”) In May, Chance and his handpicked, mainly Chicago-based team — who put out his two earlier mixtapes as free downloads — partnered with Apple Music to release his third album, Coloring Book, as an exclusive two-week stream. (Apple put up an undisclosed sum in exchange for the exclusivity.) Coloring Book not only became the first streaming-only album to chart on the Billboard 200, it opened in the top 10 and — now that the Grammy Awards have rewritten their rules to make streaming-only albums and songs eligible for awards — is hotly tipped for a nomination. Coloring Book also proved to be Chance’s most adventurous work as an artist, with a bold turn to gospel and soul-searching lyrics to match. “This guy is the future,” says Carl Chery, head of hip-hop/R&B programming at Apple Music. “He’s the most exciting hip-hop artist of the last five years.” Chance the Rapper's 'Coloring Book' Is First Streaming-Exclusive to Top the Billboard 200 Days after he delivered the Ali homage at the ESPYs, the Olympic committee asked Chance to compose an original number for this summer’s games in Rio de Janeiro. It’s hard to imagine any other young rapper, focused on the tangled particulars of his block, who possesses the moral authority to represent the country or the world in song. But Chance’s music is uniquely inspiring, sonically and socially inviting, and blissfully religious. His hip-hop scene has the feel of a big, carousing collaboration, with him and his childhood friends living out a cross between a Christian High School Musical and a Judd Apatow film, if Seth Rogen and his stoner crew were prodigies from inner-city Chicago. It’s a balancing act he pulls off seemingly without ego or pretense. “He’s the youngest old man I know,” says Hebru Brantley, the Chicago muralist and Chance collaborator. “To be so young and so wise.” Chance named his first album, from 2012, 10 Day, because when he recorded it he was on a 10-day suspension from his test-in public high school after getting caught with weed. “It has a lot of school references, maybe too many,” he now says, laughing. The album captures the life of a black middle-class teenager who loves his family, his fellow musicians and his troubled city. It’s a complicated portrait, both juvenile and profound. There’s sex and drugs and Spanish class as well as the looming threat of violence: “Round here we lose best friends like every week/I like to think we playin’ a long game of hide and go seek.” Chance isn’t a storyteller like Eminem, and he doesn’t conjure atmosphere as a disturbance the way Lamar does. He’s more of a collagist, bringing together a series of images that are indelible for their specificity and intimacy. “For young people on the city’s South or West Side, there’s nothing coming from government, from our school system that’s bolstering the kind of pride that comes out in Chance’s work,” says singer Jamila Woods, who has worked with Chance on his albums as well as on her own newly released Heavn. Chance developed his craft at a downtown after-school program called YOUmedia and at an open-mic venue called Young Chicago Authors. These spaces exposed him, in hyper-segregated Chicago, to music heads traveling from every corner of the city. He hooked up with the members of Kids These Days, a rock-rap-jazz band that included Nico Segal, who performs with Chance as Donnie Trumpet, and the rapper Vic Mensa. “We all became friends, and that collaborative process has been the blueprint for our careers,” says Segal. Chance seems to view all his musical counterparts with the same familial spirit, eschewing beefs and rap battles. “I never really liked the idea of rap being a competitive thing. It’s not. I can’t gain anything off of anyone else not succeeding,” he says. Chance the Rapper Honors USA Basketball Teams in Nike's 'Unlimited' Film Chance’s little brother Taylor, 20, also raps, and Chance appears on his 2015 debut, Broad Shoulders. Chance’s mother works for the Illinois attorney general’s office, and his father, who left the mayor’s office this summer, is now an executive with Chicago’s tourism bureau. During the past couple of years, Chance has seen Chicago’s problems up close — “My dad is getting the call every morning, updates on how many kids got shot the day before” — and his views on issues like police brutality are nuanced. He chides Emanuel for how he responded to the killing of Laquan McDonald, who was shot 16 times by a Chicago police officer in 2014. “In a time of crisis he tried to be strategic, and he should have been more compassionate,” says Chance. More generally, he adds, “There’s a larger conversation we need to have about the role of police officers, their relationship to the people as enemy or executioner, when they’re not supposed to be either. There’s also not enough pressure on internal organizations that are supposed to police the police and on judges in the justice system who are supposed to make reasonable decisions.” At 16, with his dad following other Chicago politicos to Washington, D.C., Chance met the newly elected Obama, and this year, along with a dozen other prominent musicians, he returned to the White House to talk with him about the anti-violence initiative My Brother’s Keeper. (“I’m more confident than ever,” Chance tweeted after the meeting.) In Chicago, he has used his father’s connections and political know-how to start an open-mic for teens,  distribute a combination jacket-sleeping-bag to the homeless, sponsor events at the Field Museum and fund the church camp he attended as a child. “He’s just one of those humanitarian-type of individuals,” says Chicago singer Jeremih a couple of days after Chance joined him onstage at the Pitchfork Music Festival. “There’s not a record he can’t hop on, a genre of music he can’t relate to. I don’t know too many people who could go on Jimmy Fallon one night and go to a peace rally the next day.” Chance shopped 10 Day to most of the major and a few indie labels, expecting to sign a record deal. But while he considered offers, he sold out a 500-seat venue in Chicago and was invited on tour with Childish Gambino. He figured a decision could wait. He knew he wouldn’t need a label to produce and distribute his second album, Acid Rap (“I recorded it while on acid,” he explains simply). The month he made the mixtape available for free, he went on tour opening for Mac Miller in “midsize rooms outside the Midwest.” “The kids knew all the words to my songs,” says Chance. By then he had connected with his manager, Pat Corcoran, 26, a white North Sider with a hang-loose vibe who had been setting up shows for Kids These Days while at DePaul University. “We discovered going with a label wasn’t for us,” says Corcoran. Chance the Rapper's Chart Debut Is Latest Streaming Milestone in a Year Full of Them Chance has earned money not from 99-cent downloads but from tours, merchandise, meet-and-greets and his deals with Apple and other companies — like Bud Light and Citibank, sponsors of his upcoming Magnificent Coloring Day festival — eager to reach his many young, savvy fans. (Coloring Book also expanded to Spotify and other streaming services after the Apple Music exclusive.) “It’s not about the music being free. It’s about how it is displayed and made accessible and about artistic power,” explains Chance. “It was always about the artist-to-fan relationship.” On a recent Saturday night, Chance tweeted to his 1.9 million followers that he would be making an announcement the following morning. It turned out to be a surprise show at a Chicago club, and on Sunday he updated fans on where they could buy pairs of tickets-(including at Lou Malnati’s Pizzeria and a Harold’s Chicken). The treasure hunt ended at 2 p.m., when the venue sold out. “This is exactly why I keep my @chancetherapper Twitter notifications on,” one fan tweeted with a photo of his tickets. The Magnificent Coloring Day festival, which Chance will headline as part of his current tour, showcases his ambition and hometown love, with Alicia Keys, John Legend, Lil Wayne, Skrillex, Young Thug and 2 Chainz joining him at U.S. Cellular Field, home of baseball’s White Sox, for whom he designed a line of specialty caps. The festival has broken the ballpark’s attendance record, selling more than 50,000 tickets. “It’s bigger than me f—ing with the Sox and bigger than me being a rapper,” says Chance of organizing the festival, noting that it will create jobs and attract tourist dollars. And, he says, “I think the city needs some happy moments.” Around 2:30 a.m., at the Near North Side studio, Chance is finally ready to start recording. He stands at the mic, the room dark but for a flickering screen showing Ali fights. (“I’m a method engineer,” says Lane.) Chance shuts his eyes, listening to the opening bars of a traipsing piano and the horn that follows. Then he sings, “Steady hold, I’ve grown weary and old.” After Drake, every rapper wants to be a singer, and Chance uses the rough physicality of his voice to convey emotion, landing hard on Ali’s famous superlatives — “Ain’t no one prettier/Ain’t no one wiser/Ain’t no one better! better! better!” The song, says Chance, is about spiritual redemption, about Ali finding God, with a hook made lush by Woods: “I was a rock/I was a rock and roller/But now I’m just a rock.” Recording Academy Embraces Streaming With Rule Change The Ali tribute, like a lot of music that Chance has been writing lately, veers into gospel. On Coloring Book, he samples praise music and employs worship star Kirk Franklin. Chance attends the South Side’s Covenant Faith Church of God, meets with his pastor and is conversant enough with scripture to pack his songs with surprising Biblical allusions. “Sunday Candy,” from the Donnie Trumpet & The Social Experiment album Surf, is an exuberant hymn to Chance’s grandmother. The tune is a romp, but the pleasures described are that of his family’s black church. “You look so good with that hat on, had to match with the shoes/Came and dressed in the satin, I came and sat in your pew.” The Ali song also delivers a personal punch, with Chance as the prodigal “roller.” He moved to Los Angeles in 2014, after the success of Acid Rap, and developed what he describes as a bad Xanax habit. “I don’t want to present it as a Behind the Music thing,” he jokes. “I looked up and months had passed, and I hadn’t made enough music.” He also found that he belonged back in Chicago: “I missed a lot of weddings and funerals.” At the studio, Chance’s girlfriend Kirsten, whom he has known since childhood, shows up. They had a daughter in 2015 — tonight she’s with Kirsten’s mother — and the three now live together. Chance takes a breather, and the couple enacts a scene straight out of his song “Smoke Break” — she sits sidesaddle in his lap, pulls on a blunt and then holds it to his lips. “I understand how black women are represented in rap music, how being a baby mama is perceived,” he says. “My girlfriend and I are very conscious of how many people in our situation don’t think it can work out, when it can.” He also has become less open with his drug and cigarette use. “Kids would tell me they tried acid for the first time listening to Acid Rap, asking me if I wanted some. I realized the responsibility of being a popular artist.” Settled again in Chicago, Chance tattooed a directive above his heart: “Get back to work,” written backward so it would face him in the mirror. Chance wrote parts of five songs on West’s The Life of Pablo, observing how his idol (“I’m literally Kanye’s biggest fan”) rented out an entire studio and acted as ringmaster, simultaneously directing different rooms populated by writers, engineers, producers, seamstresses, even magicians. “I watched him knock out six, seven songs that way,” says Chance. “I stole that.” To finish Coloring Book, he rented out the Chicago studio and with his team slept there overnight on inflatable mattresses. At the Taste of Chicago, in July, Chance performs with Donnie Trumpet & The Social Experiment. With his thin frame and his White Sox cap pulled low, Chance is a sudden pinwheel of ecstatic motion. He is joined by his closest friends, old and new. The typical crowded rap stage displays strength in numbers, but Chance means to evoke a choir. “It’s about group work, harmonic collaboration,” he says. “The whole project is very loving, and shouting it in a group is powerful.” The fans sing along on “No Problem,” a joyous threat to any executive who interferes with Chance’s independence. But the set is more sacred than profane. They end with “Sunday Candy,” and the concert takes on the cast of a revivalist meeting. Palms are raised skyward, fans shouting every word. Chance isn’t merely using gospel, he’s doing its work. The people in Grant Park seem transported, ready to follow wherever Lil Chano From 79th takes them next. This article originally appeared in the Aug. 20 issue of Billboard. Main Image: “I don’t make the type of raps where I lecture on how good I am or how I stand. I do flex a lot on being independent so other people in positions like mine see the options,” says Chance, photographed July 20 at The F Stop Studio in Chicago.

In fact just last month, the major Australian banks requested permission from the country’s competition regulator to join forces in an attempt to try and negotiate with Apple collectively, as opposed to individually. Unsurprisingly Apple did not take too kindly to that, and has since fired back at the Australian banks. According to a report from the Financial Review (via MacRumors), Apple claimed that the behavior of the banks was that of a cartel. Apple says that “allowing the banks to form a cartel to collectively dictate terms to new business models and services would set a troubling precedent and delay the introduction of new, potentially disruptive technologies.” Apple also claims that some of the alternatives provided by the banks would pose a serious security risk. “Apple upholds very high security standards for our customers when they use Apple devices to make payments. Providing simple access to the NFC antenna by banking applications would fundamentally diminish the high level of security Apple aims to have on our devices.” The Cupertino company adds, “These banks want to maintain complete control over their customers. The present application is only the latest tactic employed by these competing banks to blunt Apple’s entry into the Australian market.” Of course all this back and forth only means that customers in Australia will just have to wait a bit longer for Apple Pay to be fully realized in their country, so it will be interesting to see who will give in, or if a suitable compromise can be found.

Apple remains ahead of Acer, Samsung and Toshiba. TrendForce notes that laptop sales usually peak in the second half of the year thanks to back-to-school and holiday purchases, and Apple should benefit particularly strongly as it finally updates the MacBook Pro range, which has not been refreshed since spring of last year. Apple’s MacBook shipments in the second quarter were up 30.3% versus the first quarter, placing the brand on the fifth spot of the half-year ranking. This shipment surge was generated by the release of an upgraded 12-inch model of the latest MacBook. TrendForce expects MacBook shipments to register sequential growth in the third and fourth quarter because Apple will also be releasing new products. The 2016 MacBook Pro range is expected to go on sale in Q4, with a smaller and slimmer form-factor, OLED touch panel with app-specific functions, Touch ID power button and the option of AMD Polaris GPUs. Supply chain research by TrendForce provided relatively early support for initial reports that the iPhone 7 would be a relatively minor upgrade over the iPhone 6s.

Available to download over-the-air and via the Apple Developer Center website for registered Apple developers, the new Safari 10 beta comes with some of the new features and functions of the official Safari 10 version that is slated for a fall release alongside the macOS Sierra, according to MacRumors. The fifth developer Safari 10 beta has a new Bookmarks sidebar that lets users focus in on a specific folder with a double-click. In addition, the Bookmarks display has been redesigned along with the History list. Related Stories A10 Chip, Rumored To Power iPhone 7, Appears In Leaked Photo Apple To Release Health-Centric Apple Watch Next Year Google Chrome To Block Flash Content Starting Next Month Developers who will be getting the Safari 10 beta 5 can also check out the improved ranking system of frequently visited websites, the site-specific zooming feature, the Web Inspector Timelines tab, the enhanced Autofill command that automatically fills out tabs with data from Contacts, HTML5 support and legacy Plug-ins and the new Spotlight feature that includes suggestions for Top Hits. Just like the previous betas, this new one also comes with Safari Extensions, which means developers can use the preview in making extensions for the Safari 10 app and make them available later on the Mac App Store. Though the Safari 10 beta 5 is pretty packed with many new features and improved implementations, there are still features not included in this one, such as the Apple Pay on the Web and Picture in Picture. Both features are only available on the macOS Sierra developer beta, as per 9To5Mac. Meanwhile, the official Safari 10 version that will arrive with the macOS Sierra is said to disable Adobe Flash by default and only allows users to view flash content on a case-by-case basis. This functionality is being implemented to ensure that the Web browser would function more efficiently and securely.

By Mary-Ann Russon August 11, 2016 13:46 BST A private firm is offering large rewards to hackers that report undisclosed security vulnerabilities, plus bonuses if the zero-day exploit doesn't get patched by the vendoriStock Forget about Apple's bug bounty programme – a US-based private firm is willing to offer security researchers and white hat hackers up to $300,000 (£231,000) more if they report undisclosed software vulnerabilities concerning Apple products to it instead of the technology giant. Texas-based firm Exodus Intelligence is offering to pay hackers and researchers up to $500,000 if they can provide undiscovered security vulnerabilities, also known as "zero-day vulnerabilities", specifically affecting iOS 9.3 and up, which is $300,000 more than Apple itself will pay. Even more interesting, if the zero-day exploit continues to stay alive and isn't patched or discovered by the vendor, the hacker will receive an additional bonus payment every quarter that the software vulnerability continues to exist, and the firm also wants to know about vulnerabilities that have been patched, which are called "N-days". Exodus has published a list of prices for attacks on its website, and after iOS flaws, the next most in demand are attacks for the Google Chrome web browser ($150,000), followed by Microsoft Edge ($125,000), Firefox ($80,000), vulnerabilities specifically relating to the Local Privilege Escalation (LPE) in Windows 10, and vulnerabilities affecting Adobe Flash and Adobe Reader ($60,000 each). Unlike Apple's invite-only programme, any hacker that would like to take part simply needs to register an account on Exodus' RSP platform and they will be paid by cheque, wire transfer or bitcoin if the vulnerability is accepted. Why is this a big deal? At the moment, the highest demand is for security flaws in iOS 9.3, Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge, according to Exodus Intelligencescreenshot by IBTimes UK It's long been known that there's a huge underground black market on the Dark Web for software bugs that affect crucial operating systems such as Windows, Linux (used for servers), iOS, Mac OS X and Android, as well as certain messaging apps and web services including WhatsApp, Telegram, Facebook, Twitter, Yahoo Mail and Gmail, but no one knows exactly how many there are or how much they are typically sold for – until now. The idea is that cybercriminals will pay anyone who is willing to tell them about the vulnerability and prevent the operating system or software's vendors from patching the flaw, because it's much better for the criminals if they have a consistent backdoor they can use to hack into a government or enterprise network. The cybercriminals are also often employed by nefarious clients who hire them to hack into an organisation's servers for profit or spying purposes, or the clients are willing to pay even more money to keep certain security flaws secret, so for example, if there was a flaw that would make it easy for an attacker to spy on all messages sent from any iPhone, certain parties would do anything to keep that from Apple. And it's not just the bad guys who do it – in December 2015, the FBI admitted that it too uses zero-day exploits in order to spy on potential terrorists and criminals, and it does so without informing the affected vendors either. Exodus offers a subscription-only database of software bugs that costs its customers $200,000 per annum, targeting antivirus vendors that want to keep their users safe, but the problem is, the service is also open to clients that might seek to capitalise on undisclosed vulnerabilities for whatever nefarious purpose – from hacking for profit to spying on citizens.

Wed, 07/27/2016 - 16:40 Apple AR Future: Tim Cook Believes Augmented Reality Could Be Next 'New Computing Platform' Bloomberg reports Apple is preparing the first major overhaul of its MacBook Pro line in more than four years, and that the new laptops will include a secondary display above the keyboard. According to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, Apple will reveal new 13- and 15-inch models of its high-end, retina display laptop soon, although this announcement isn’t expected to coincide with the September announcement of the iPhone 7 (which may actually be called the iPhone 6SE). However, TechCrunch “could see Apple introducing the new laptop in October.” The MacBook Pro line hasn’t seen an update of any kind in well over a year, and according to Bloomberg, part of the reason for the overhaul is that the iPad is no longer the reliable cash-cow it once was; sales were down 23 percent in the last year. “Consumers are taking longer to buy or replace iPads,” Gurman said. “Apple research suggests customers upgrade iPads roughly every three years, while they buy new iPhones every 18 to 24 months.” Perhaps the most significant design change to the new MacBook Pros comes in the addition of a secondary OLED display above the keyboard, replacing the function key row. “Instead of physical keys, a strip-like screen will present functions on an as-needed basis that fit the current task or application,” Gurman said. It’s not yet clear how the OLED strip will work, though TechCrunch predicts it could go beyond basic laptop functions to “display shortcuts and information depending on the app you’re using.” What do you think of the potential of a revamped MacBook Pro?

A Bloomberg report says Apple is planning to launch the most substantial refresh of the MacBook Pro in more than four years. “If the details are correct, it’s a really compelling upgrade,” said Jerry Zigmont, owner of MacWorks, an Apple partner based in Madison, Conn.. [Related: 5 Apple Products That Need A Refresh This Fall (Besides The iPhone)] As reported by Bloomberg, the new version of the MacBook Pro would be thinner with a wider trackpad and offer improved graphics processors. it will integrate USB-C connectivity and Touch ID fingerprint technology, and, perhaps most notably, add a touch screen “strip” above the keyboard in place of the typical row of function keys. The touch screen strip would provide functions that are tailored to the needs of the application currently in use, according to the report. “The programmable strip across the top could be a game-changer for people,” Zigmont told CRN. For instance, graphic designers might be able to customize the strip for saving time on cutting, pasting, adding new layers and other functions.  Regardless of whether or not the touch screen strip is included, upgrades to specs and hardware on the MacBook Pro would be very welcome, said Michael Oh, CTO of TSP LLC, a Cambridge, Mass.-based Apple partner. The most current version of the laptop uses Intel's previous generation of processors, for instance. “Certainly it should be a pretty big change in terms of processing and graphics power, and hopefully the form factor as well,” Oh said. “They’ve been using the same case form factor for [the past] four years. Which has actually held up really well. But it’s time for Apple to make a change.” Pages 1 2 next › last » Printer-friendly version Email this CRN article Slide Shows CRN Exclusive: HPE CEO Whitman On Cisco's 'Weakness,' the Arista Partner Opportunity, Server Sales Issues, And The Starboard Value Investment In HPE Hewlett Packard Enterprise CEO Meg Whitman spoke with CRN about competing against Cisco, HPE's partnership with Cisco rival Arista, server sales execution issues in the channel and the Starboard Value fund's investment in HPE. 12 Things To Know About Presidio's IPO Filing Here are 12 things to know about solution provider Presidio's IPO filed on Tuesday around its strategy, revenue drivers and market concerns.

Apple Macbook Pro 2016 rumor spilled by credible source stating that it will be thinner with OLED touchbar replacing function keys (Photo : Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images) Apple superfans are expecting Macbook Pro 2016 to be unveiled alongside the release of iPhone 7 on September. The latest rant on the web might make them upset but at least the expected features are going to happen. Major upgrades in Macbook Pro 2016 The next generation of Macbook Pro will receive huge upgrades. An internal source spilled the news for Bloomberg stating that Apple has been testing the advanced system since January and it won't appear in September event on iPhone 7 release. Apple rumor on Macbook Pro 2016 having OLED touchbar and thinner design could be true The source also mentioned about the specs that will equip the Macbook Pro 2016. It will have thinner design with OLED touchbar replacing physical function keys. Many rants have doubted the presence of OLED touchbar since it would be an overhaul for the device and likely to cost a fortune. The anonymous source said that the next Macbook Pro will be thinner, more powerful with an enhanced graphics, too. Previously, many have predicted that Macbook Pro 2016 will come with four USB type C ports, omitting headphone jack, Touch ID and Retina display. Another detail is about the presence of AMD chipset which allows Macbook Pro 2016 to have slimmer design but be power-efficient. AMD did describe the new chipset design as 'thinner' but refused to comment on whether it will be shipped with Macbook Pro 2016. Macbook Pro 2016 Release Date: Laptop won't make any appearance in September Rumor has it that if Apple will not unveil the laptop in September, it would likely be announced sometime in October with possible release in November. It seems that the fans will only see the iPhone 7 and probably the next generation of Apple Watch on September 7. Do you think Macbook Pro 2016 will be launched without any on-stage event? As usual, Apple declines to comment or confirm any of the rumors about its Macbook Pro 2016.   Tags Apple MacBook Pro 2016, apple macbook pro 2016 release date, apple rumors macbook pro © 2016 University Herald, All rights reserved.

Merchants are showing the way to capture the U.S. consumers' attention in use of mobile wallets, and the financial institutions facilitating the effort will be able to demonstrate continued value to their merchant clients according to this research report, Merchant Mobile Wallets: Mobile Payments in Action. Adoption of universal mobile payment methodologies such as Apple Pay and Samsung Pay continues to lag in the United States compared to developed economies in Europe and Asia. Technology companies involved in the production and distribution of mobile devices (Apple, Samsung) have assumed the mantle of lead advocate, while many major banks and mobility network providers assist in a support role. Modifying existing electronic payment methods to be mobile and reside on the near ubiquitous smartphone device, now estimated to be used by between 80% and 85% of U.S. mobile subscribers, has been an important effort in retail payments for some time. The migration of noncash payment to the mobile device will eventually be widespread, but at present it proceeds at a pace reflective of technology device upgrade. However, several players in the merchant sector have recognized and exploited opportunity to reshape payment processes and methods to their own benefit and as a marketing tool. This shift represents an opportunity for merchants and financial institutions alike, according to this research. This research report defines single-merchant and merchant-aggregator mobile wallets, profiles examples of each, and explains how these two wallet categories differ from universal mobile wallets. Coverage includes the strengths and weaknesses of the two merchant wallet styles and the characteristics of merchants that would most benefit from each style. "The technology that is prerequisite for the use of Apple Pay, Android Pay, and Samsung Pay is not held by a majority of Americans on their current smartphone devices. This creates an opportunity for merchants and their partners to create and refine business-specific payment solutions that generate richer customer engagement interactions and consumer rewards. Merchants and their partners have a chance to demonstrate added value and provide incentives for customers to adopt merchant mobile payment apps that leverage mobile technology already in their hands,", the Senior Analyst, Emerging Technology Advisory Service and author of the report. Highlights of the research note include: - The objective of the merchant mobile wallet - How the two types of merchant mobile wallets-single-merchant and merchant-aggregator-function, with profiles of examples of each type - Merits of merchant mobile wallets versus merits of universal wallets - Near-term opportunities for merchant mobile wallets - Estimates of merchant mobile wallet spend in the United States Key Topics Covered: 1.

Every year, the build-up to the launch of the new iPhone creates great hype, and according to the latest reports, this year's event might take place on September 7. According to a report earlier this week by Bloomberg, this year's iPhone launch event will take place on September 7. The launch events usually take place in the first half of September and therefore the information is certainly credible, and author Mark Gurman has in the past been a reliable source of Apple rumours. However, there has been no official word from the Cupertino tech giant about the launch event as of now. The company is rumoured to be working on new MacBook Pro models but according to the report, the MacBook models will not be announced at the iPhone launch event.In other leaks, images of alleged 'A10' processor, which is rumoured to be used on the upcoming iPhone models, have been leaked on Chinese website Weibo (via 9to5Mac). The name of the processor is very much in line with previous processors used by the company however, the credibility of the pictures is not yet concrete. The upcoming iPhone models are rumoured to lack a 3.5mm headphone jack, and feature redesigned antenna lines. The phones are also expected to pack improved hardware including the camera, while some leaks have also suggested that there might be a Pro version in the works. Last week, it was suggested that apart from the colour variants available on iPhone 6s, a 'Space Black' variant of the phone will also be available with the new iPhone models. Despite the recent surge in Apple's stock prices after it reported its third-quarter earnings, Apple is not seen in a purple patch by the industry experts. Stuart Frankel's Director of Institutional Sales Steve Grasso in a statement to CNBC said that Apple will "underperform perpetually" and also added that the upcoming iPhone is also likely to disappoint.

The latest rumour surrounding the iPhone 7 is that Apple is moving from an aluminium to an "all glass" design. Apparently, this will be a change for 2017's version of the iPhone rather than the one we're expecting to see in September. It also comes at the behest of Foxconn, Apple's China-based manufacturing partner. Read More iPhone 7: Release date, rumours, leaked images, price and all the latest news about Apple's next iPhone According to a source speaking to Japanese website Nikkei : "Foxconn has been trying glass chassis' since last year." Read More Hackers are tricking iPhone users into handing over their Apple IDs - don't fall for the scam Another source told the site: "It is only natural that Foxconn is trying to come up with glass chassis as the capabilities to provide more components will bolster its standing within the supply chain and help with more orders." Read More iPhone 7 launch date CONFIRMED - Apple to unveil its new smartphone next week (Photo: Martin Hajek) This isn't the first time the all-glass rumour has surfaced. Back in April, a tech analyst called Ming-Chi Kuo published a report saying the same thing . Apple has used glass in its iPhones before. The iPhone 4 and 4s had glass front and back panels, with a stainless steel band sandwiched between the two. Read More Samsung's latest smartwatch designs look A LOT like the Apple Watch - and it hasn't gone unnoticed The arguments to be made for a glass smartphone include better antenna reception and more options for wireless charging. Some gadget fans have said that since other manufacturers are embracing aluminium casing it would be a way for Apple to differentiate itself. (Photo: Yasser Farahi) "Market watchers suggested that Apple's new iPhones would adopt glass casings with metal frames and advanced organic light-emitting diode (OLED) panels, a design Samsung already uses for its premium handsets," reported Nikkei.com.

Three iPhone 7 mock-ups give us in-depth look at Apple's next phone (Photo: Youtube/Bshop Kuwa) Of course, as with any pre-release iPhone "leak" this is just speculation at this point. But we're not sure how an all-glass iPhone 7 would cope if you accidentally dropped it. Although many are expecting the iPhone released in September 2016 to be called the iPhone 7, some leaks suggest that Apple may opt instead for the "iPhone 6SE" moniker .

Analysts have been saying for some time that Apple is planning to move to a three-year design refresh cycle, suggesting the next major update would come in 2017. poll loading What should the next iPhone be made out of? 0+ VOTES SO FAR Aluminium Glass Plastic Wood Like us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter Daily Newsletter Follow @MirrorTech Subscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribe Comments Show more comments More On Apple iPhone iPhone rumours Smartphones iPhone 7 tech all Most Read Most Recent Black FridayWhere to find the best Playstation deals online on Black Friday 2016 Have you got your eye on anything in particular for Black Friday?

More than just technology news Home Tech Reviews Science Games Culture Video Stay Connected Facebook Twitter RSS Updated Hot Tags Pokemon Go Pokemon Sun And Moon Apple Pokemon Sun And Moon news Pokemon Go Update MacBook Pro Update: Apple To Release 13-inch and 15-inch Versions With Touch ID Sensor And OLED Mini Screen Jaswin Singh First Posted: Aug 11, 2016 06:58 AM EDT The new MacBook Pro to have better features than the last one. (MacBook Pro website) A major update will happen with MacBook Pro. The new MacBook Pro will now have touch screen strip for function keys. It will also have more power and efficient graphics processors for expert users such as video gamers. Apple will launch a new 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pro laptops with retina displays soon. They are also planning to have it with Touch ID sensor and an OLED mini screen above the keyboard. Apple is really upping their game with this MacBook Pro release. Tech Crunch said MacBook Pro will be a lot lighter and thinner this time. It will also not be like MacBook Air with its wedge-shape design. MacBook Pro will utilize the Touch ID sensor that will protect the laptop. It will be more secure and it will be easier to open one user's own account with it. Also, the OLED mini screen keyboard is still a wonder to many. As to how Apple will incorporate the said new feature will be a surprise. The said feature will replace the physical function keys and will let the user control basic laptop functions using the screen. It will also add other short cut keys that will let the user do other functions when logged in to some things. Steve Jobs said before that iPad will be the "post-PC" gadget that people will need. However, with the release of the MacBook Pro, things will change. Bloomberg reported that the sales of MacBook Pro are continually rising in the last couple of years compared to iPads. Moreover, research shows that people are using their iPads longer than MacBooks so Apple is taking advantage of this and will release the new MacBook Pro. MacBook Pro will not be released at the same time with the new iPhones. It will take longer to complete its designs and features as Apple wants it to be almost perfect for the users.  Related Articles Japan Parades 1,000 Pikachus For Pokemon Fans Sony To Reveal PlayStation Neo In September Video of Rumored iPhone7 Lightning Earpods Leaks On The Internet TagsMacBook Pro Update, macbook pro, MacBook Pro Touch ID Sensor, MacBook Pro OLED Mini Screen, MacBook Pro retina display, Apple Get the Most Popular iTechPost Stories in a Weekly Newsletter © 2016 iTech Post All rights reserved.

Eric Jhonsa Aug 11, 2016 9:26 AM EDT Report: Apple is prepping MacBook Pros with touch panel strips, will unveil iPhone 7 on Sept. 7 Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, who developed quite the track record for providing Apple  (AAPL) scoops while at 9to5 Mac, reports Apple is prepping its first major MacBook Pro overhaul in four years. The new Pro models will reportedly be slightly thinner than their predecessors, sport Touch ID fingerprint sensors and (perhaps most importantly) do away with standard function keys in favor of a touch panel that will "present functions on an as-needed basis that fit the current task or application," and whose functions can be updated via software. Apple also reportedly plans to provide a Pro model that features a high-performance AMD (AMD) GPU based on the chipmaker's new Polaris architecture. AMD's efforts to make Polaris very power-efficient reportedly helped win Apple over. Apple is coming off a third quarter in which its Mac sales fell 13% annually to $5.2 billion. The company's retina MacBooks (launched last year and refreshed this year) have won praise for their form factor and battery life, but their performance limitations and reliance on a sole USB port for power and data have been deal-breakers for many Pro owners. Thus a major Pro refresh could be well-received by Apple's base. Separately, Gurman reports the iPhone 7 is set to be unveiled at an event on Wednesday, Sept. 7. Given Apple's launch history, that suggests the iPhone 7 will ship on Friday, Sept. 16, which in turn would allow Apple to record two weeks of iPhone 7 sales during its September quarter.

According to a Bloomberg report that cited people familiar with the matter, the MacBook Pro line of notebooks won’t debut on Sept. 7 when Apple unveils its next-generation iPhone. Everyone had been expecting the iPhone 7 to be launched in the fall, but now, there appears to be a firmer date. Apple has reportedly been testing the new MacBook Pros since earlier in the year and are aimed at boosting sales of notebook computers, which have taken a big hit as consumers’ love affair with smartphones and tablets trumps their desire for a laptop. The apparent release date for the new iPhone 7 comes at a time when Steve Grasso, director of institutional sales at Stuart Frankel, said in a CNBC segment that Apple’s stock is going to underperform “perpetually.” Grasso pointed to Apple’s reliance on the iPhone as one problem hurting the stock. That’s because analysts are bracing for the iPhone 7 to not be as big of a hit as its past iPhone iterations. “Right now, everyone is looking forward to the iPhone 7 … I think it can only disappoint,” Grasso was quoted as saying in the report. He said investors are better off going with Facebook or Amazon if they are looking for growth stocks. Meanwhile, Craig Johnson, an analyst at Piper Jaffray, agreed that, for investors looking for a growth stock, Apple isn’t the place to invest their money. Unlike Grasso, he thinks there’s upside to shares of Apple but said it will be a winner over the long term. “The stock has been very resilient; it’s found support four times at that $90 level,” Johnson said. “[There’s] more upside to come, but again, this isn’t going to be one of those big long-term winners.” Related Items:Apple, iPhone, MacBook Pro, What's Hot Share Tweet Share Share Share Email Recommended for you Apple Re-Joins Black Friday, Deals And Details Not Yet Unveiled Uber Of X: Rent-A-Ref, Sports Officials For Any Game Or Tournament PYMNTS Daily Data Dive: India’s Rupee Update Get our hottest stories delivered to your inbox.

The firm explained in a blog post on Tuesday that it’s also willing to pay up to $125,000 for Microsoft Edge exploits, as part of what it called its “Research Sponsorship Program” (RSP). That’s a huge mark-up on the $1500 Microsoft is prepared to shell out. Apple’s top payment is a more hefty $200,000 but this still falls some way short of the amount Exodus is prepared to pay out. “For each new Zero-Day acquired, Exodus will offer the researcher an initial payment, received after the request is reviewed and accepted. Once accepted, the researcher could receive payments every quarter the Zero-Day exploit is still alive,” it explained. “The specific values of the initial payment and quarterly bonus will be included in an offer presented to the researcher, following the review of their work. Additionally, Exodus also offers payment in the form of Bitcoin for Zero-Day research.” Apple announced its bug bounty program last week, claiming it would only be open to a few dozen researchers to begin with. The top award of $200,000 is reserved for those who find serious vulnerabilities in the iOS secure boot firmware. The firm probably feels the need to crowdsource bugs in this way as it is under increasing pressure from US law enforcers keen to crack its handsets in order to access data they believe is vital to ongoing cases. It emerged in April that the FBI might have paid hackers in excess of $1 million to source a zero day vulnerability which allowed it to access the device of one of the alleged San Bernardino shooters. That followed a major stand-off with Apple in the courts which the tech giant eventually won, claiming that engineering backdoors in any of its products would set a dangerous precedent.

A wearable device can be affixed to a limb of the human body such as a wrist or ankle, as an example. The wearable device can be worn on the left or right wrist, or even on the right or left ankle. The reason the patent application emphasizes use on either left or right side of the body is that the patent focuses on an issue that can arise when taking readings from only one side of the body … Since electrocardiographic measurements can depend on the electrode’s relative position to the heart being measured, and since the electrodes can be affixed to the wearable device, changing the device’s location from right to left, or wrist to ankle, can have an impact on the acquired electrocardiographic measurements. As an example, wearing the device on the left wrist vs. wearing the device on the right wrist can produce electrocardiographic measurements that are inverted relative to one another. The device Apple describes can recognise when readings are inverted, and automatically correct them. Readings are taken by placing a finger on a surface electrode. The patent outlines a calibration phase, in which the user is initially prompted to take readings from a variety of locations on their body – such as left wrist with right finger and right leg with left finger – to achieve baseline readings from which it can interpret subsequent tests. Our usual disclaimer applies: just because Apple patents something doesn’t mean it will ever make it into product form. The company does, though, have a keen interest in the health field, with Tim Cook last year hinting at new health-related hardware. He said then that the company didn’t want Apple Watch innovation held up by the need for FDA approvals, hence the appeal of separate hardware. Just a few days ago, a vaguely-worded Chinese report claimed that Apple was working on a new ‘killer device’ in the health field Guides Health View THe Guide blog comments powered by Disqus Submit a Tip cancel Submitting a tip constitutes permission to publish and syndicate.

Megha Kedia First Posted: Aug 11, 2016 06:20 AM EDT Logitech has launched its “Create” backlit keyboard case for Apple’s 9.7-inch iPad Pro. (Photo : Rachel Murray/Getty Images for Mediaplacement) Logitech has reportedly launched its "Create" backlit keyboard case made specifically for Apple's 9.7-inch iPad Pro. Last year it was Apple's 12.9-inch iPad Pro which got a compatible keyboard case from the accessory maker. Advertisement Talking about the new Logitech "Create" keyboard case, it has been designed to work exclusively with Apple's new Smart Connector. The keyboard case automatically powers on and pairs with the iPad Pro when a user snaps it into place. It doesn't require pairing with the Bluetooth. The case is 9.8 x 7.0 x 0.9 inches (248 x 178 x 23 mm) in size and weighs just under a pound: 15 oz. (426 g). The keyboard backlights enables the use of the accessory in any lighting condition. The Smart Connector draws power from the iPad and uses it to illuminate the backlit keys, reported MacWorld. The "Create" features a row of dedicated iOS shortcut keys which enable users to quickly adjust brightness, control media, open a web browser or go back to the home screen. The keyboard case also has a built-in slot that securely holds Apple Pencil and keeps the stylus within easy reach at all times so it is there when one needs it. "CREATE is like the Swiss Army Knife of keyboard cases," said Michele Hermann, vice president of tablet accessories at Logitech, reported Business Wire. "It puts all the tools you need at your fingertips, and the keyboard charges through the Smart Connector so you can just set your iPad Pro into a typing position and go. It brings typing on the iPad Pro to a whole new level." According to the Verge, Logitech "Create" for iPad Pro 9.7 is comparatively better than Apple's Smart Keyboard. In terms of pricing, the keyboard case costs $129.99, which is $19 less than Apple's Smart Keyboard which sells for $149. The Logitech "Create" keyboard case is currently available for purchase in in two color options- black and blue- from Logitech or Apple's website. Did You Try Logitech "Create" for iPad Pro 9.7?

That could benefit Microsoft's search engine. Sam Mattera (TMFMattera) Aug 11, 2016 at 6:22AM Image source: Apple. Later this year, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) will release macOS Sierra, the next version of its Mac operating system. Sierra will bring a number of notable improvements to Apple's PCs, including support for Apple Pay and deeper integration with iOS devices. It also brings Siri, Apple's digital personal assistant. Siri made her debut back in 2011, but it's taken Apple a full five years to bring her to the Mac. Nevertheless, her introduction could dramatically improve the productivity of Mac users, and give them a new way to interact with their machines. It could also pose a threat to Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google. Siri comes to the desktop Once they've installed Sierra, Mac users will be able to call on Siri by speaking to their machines. It's a bit of a shift from the familiar mouse and keyboard, but impressions have been generally favorable. Wired's David Pierce described the process of using Siri on the Mac as "almost natural" and "definitely useful." Ultimately, he concluded that Siri may be better on the Mac than she is on the iPhone. In addition to her standard functionality, Mac Siri can conduct special Mac-related tasks, like searching local files or changing settings. iPhone users often find Siri most useful when they aren't actually using their phones at all -- Apple has trumpeted Siri's hands-free features as a key selling point in recent years. But on the Mac, she offers the prospect of improved multi-tasking. A Mac owner can use Siri to change a setting, play a song, or find a file without leaving their current application. The inclusion of Siri probably won't help Apple sell that many more Macs, as competing machines running Windows 10 have something similar. Still, it does enhance Apple's offerings and ensures that the company is keeping pace with its rivals. Cortana has helped Bing capture share Perhaps more interesting is what Siri could do to the search market. Beyond finding files and changing settings, Siri can be used to scour the web. Since 2013, she's relied on Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Bing to do so. Unless you specifically request Google, simple commands such as "find me chicken recipes" will result in Siri conducting a Bing search. Last December, research firm Kantar found that Siri relied on Bing frequently. Analyzing the behavior of 3,000 different Siri users, Kantar found that Bing powered 63% of the searches Siri conducted. Microsoft's share of the U.S. search market has been rising in recent quarters. In July, 2015, Bing captured 20.4% of the U.S. desktop search market, according to comScore. Google's share was more than three times higher, at 64%. But over the last year, the gap has closed a bit. In June, comScore reported Bing's market share at 21.8%. Meanwhile, Google stood at 63.8%. That shift has been driven by Windows 10 -- last quarter, over 40% of Microsoft's search revenue came from Windows 10 devices. Like macOS Sierra, Windows 10 includes a digital personal assistant: Cortana, which, unsurprisingly, is also powered by Bing. Cortana is integrated directly into the Windows 10 taskbar, and on many PCs can be summoned with a quick voice command. To date, Windows 10 users have asked Cortana more than 8 billion questions, and 100 million Windows 10 users rely on her each month. Siri's addition to the Mac could have a similar effect. There are fewer Mac users than Windows users, obviously, but Siri could shift some search queries to Bing in the months ahead. If Bing's share of the search market continues to rise, Microsoft may have Apple to thank. Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

Get Smart With Stacey: Is Apple HomeKit Worth the Hype? By Stacey Higginbotham August 10, 2016 10 Comments This week, Stacey tackles temperature sensors and whether Apple HomeKit is a good investment. The smart home is gaining ground, but it's still a muddle of confusing standards, competing platforms, and gadgets that don't do what you might expect. But the promise of products that can make your life a little easier is hard to resist, so I'm here to answer the inevitable questions that arise. Whether it's figuring out the best connected door lock to assembling the right recipe to wake you up with a faux sunrise at the optimal moment based on yourfitness tracker's data, I've got you covered. As the host of The Internet of Things Podcast, I install a lot of gear and spend hours testing hardware and software to see what works. Smart homes are still pretty dumb, but I want to help you feel smart. If you have smart home questions you'd like me to answer, send an email to questions@iotpodcast.com. I'm looking to purchase a few temperature sensors to use around my home, and I was wondering if you have reviewed any or had any recommendations? Have you heard if the Wireless Sensor Tag sensors work well? I couldn't find many reviews. Thanks. —Adam K. Knoxville, Tenn. One day, every connected device will have a basic temperature sensor in it, if it doesn't already. The real magic comes from not just sensing the temperature, but sharing that information with devices that need it. That's actually harder than you might imagine since we don't have an accepted discovery and communications protocol for the smart home. So, you may already have temperature sensors around your home. For example, Zuli, a connected outlet and presence sensor, has a temperature sensor inside that works with the Nest Learning Thermostat. The Leeo smoke alarm detector ($50) also has a temp sensor in it that gets shared with If This Then That. Most security devices such as the Canary also have a temp sensor inside that you can check via the app. If you don't have any other devices in your home, you may want to prepare yourself for a few. Most temperature sensors require a hub of come sort to talk to the Internet and other devices. That's because they forgo the power-gulping Wi-Fi radio in exchange for ZigBee, Z-wave, or a proprietary technology that can last longer on battery power. The Wireless Sensor Tags you've mentioned fall into this category, as do the Aeotec Z-wave sensors and Fibaro sensors. Those sensors range from $25 for the Wireless Sensor Tag to $50 for the Fibaro and Aeotec sensors equipped with a temperature sensor. The Wireless Sensor Tag hub is $54 and other Z-wave hubs range from $70 to $100. For the dedicated Apple fan who wants to use HomeKit, Elegato makes a line of sensors called Eve with two temperature-sensing options. The Eve Room ($79.95) indoor air quality-monitor tracks temp, humidity, and volatile organic compounds such as VOCs such as alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, organic acids, and aromatic hydrocarbons. The Eve Weather ($49.95) works outdoors and tracks, temperature, humidity and air pressure. But before you settle on a sensor, ask yourself what you want to it to do. For now, you probably just want something that shows you the temperature and maybe ties into an A/C system or activates a fan. If you want it to tie into your A/C, then you probably need to pick something that is designed to work with your thermostat, because the manufacturers have worked to build integrations that take temperature settings into account to influence their devices. For something like controlling a fan or closing blinds, an If This Then That recipe or programming a smart hub with a rule should work. One day, I hope sensors will be built into walls and we'll have standards. Then all of this effort will seem silly. As a serious Apple fan-boy (I'll admit), am I shooting myself in the foot by wanting to make sure all my smart home appliances are HomeKit (or at least HomeBridge) compatible? I want to be able to control everything from everything, and more importantly to get my wife to do it, too. The current market fragmentation has me wondering just how much smart home compatibility and use is "hacky." It seems to me like HomeKit is the answer to that, but Oh Em Gee, it's slow! —Adam D., the UK I don't know about shooting yourself in the foot, Adam, but you are going to be buying into an unknown with HomeKit. But before you worry too much, basically all of the smart home tech out here is an unknown at this point. We simply have no idea what is going to work for the long term, which is how we like to think of our house-related investments. //Related Articles Get Smart With Stacey: How Do I Set Up Automatic Blinds? So, if you can handle spending some cash on a relative uncertainty, then HomeKit feels as good a choice as any in the market. Apple has focused initially on security and ease of connection with its smart home efforts. This means every HomeKit-certified device has a special chip inside. So if you have older gear that isn't HomeKit certified, it won't work. But if you haven't started buying connected devices yet, and you're a big Apple lover, then starting with HomeKit-certified products isn't too crazy. I have two caveats, though. The first is that Apple hasn't really shown us a compelling or exciting UI for the smart home that's radically different from the existing products. So if you (or your wife) isn't a fan of the user interface that's out there today, then HomeKit isn't going to change things. The second caveat is that Apple's stance toward controlling the hardware has led to some platforms refusing to work with HomeKit at all. So it's possible that some devices may never make the leap to HomeKit. A final word of caution. Tying your home automation, which should last for five or 10 years, to a device and operating system that you replace every 18 months to two years may eventually cause problems down the road. For example, what if you switch to an Android phone? As I said at the beginning, there are a lot of unknowns about the smart home that make it hard to invest. That hasn't stopped me, but I'm content with "hacky" solutions and have a husband who is resigned to living in a lab. Back to top Previous : Get Smart With Stacey: How Do I Set Up Automatic Blinds?

Apple is maintaining utmost secrecy on the release of the iPhone 7, however, reports have claimed that it will happen in a few weeks. Raymond Ronamai   August 11, 2016 16:09 IST 2 Shares 2 Shares Amazon Prime offers best deal on iPhonesREUTERS/David Gray All eyes are on Apple's upcoming flagship smartphone iPhone 7 as its release date is drawing near. Expectations from the device is huge this time, more so because of a decline in sales of iPhones for two consecutive quarters. Now, the big question is whether the iPhone 6s successor will bail the company from poor sales. The Cupertino giant is maintaining utmost secrecy on the release date of the iPhone 7, but Bloomberg has claimed in a report that it will be released on Sept. 7, the same day when Sony has scheduled its PlayStation event. It contradicts an earlier claim made by leakster Evan Blass aka @evleaks that the device will be announced on Sept. 12. Why advertise with us? Related How will Apple's iPhone 7 Plus stack up against Samsung Galaxy Note 7? How will Apple's iPhone 7 stack up against iPhone 6s? Apple's share in Indian smartphone market is getting thinner instead of increasing, considering growth of smartphone users in the country. According to market research firm Strategy Analytics, Apple sold only 0.8 million iPhones in the Q2 this year in India compared to 1.2 million units sold in Q2, 2015. The company's share in Indian smartphone market has dropped to 2.4 percent from 4.5 percent in Q2 last year, which will worry Apple's think-tanks. It is to be seen if the upcoming iPhone 7 will boost sales of the Apple smartphone in India, but if not this time, it will become even harder to make its presence felt in the country, as Android's dominance is palpable with 97 percent smartphones running on the OS as of Q 2, 2016, compared to 90 percent in the corresponding period last year. Apple is expected to announce iPhone 7 with a 4.7-inch screen, and iPhone 7 Plus with a 5.5-inch display and dual camera. Both the models are expected to share other specifications like A10 chip, iOS 10 software, 3GB RAM, and camera with OIS feature. It is also expected to feature a capacitive touch button and replace the 3.5mm headphone jack with a lightning jack.

Apple’s recent foray into this field is already bringing out the wolves, with one offering double if you don’t tell Apple what you know. Last week, Apple announced a bug bounty program targeting kernel exploits and data security. It’s top-end payout is $200,000 for exploits related to boot firmware, and scales down to around $25,000 if you discover an issue with its sandboxing process. TNW Answers Your questions answered by founders, experts and thought leaders in business, design and tech. Join a chat It’s fairly run-of-the-mill stuff; hackers discover a problem, report it back to the company and make money for their work while helping the community at-large. A company named Exodus will pay over double — $500,000 — for exploits, but is vague about what might earn you that much cash. The company operates on behalf of private firms, and has no apparent interest in the greater good. That’s made more evident by its payout structure. On top of whatever the company will pay upfront, Exodus offers to pay quarterly if a discovered hack goes unnoticed by others. It even pays via Bitcoin, and has a ‘hitlist’ for “software targets of immediate interest.” All told, Exodus wants hackers to become hired guns. Exodus also doesn’t say why they’d pay so much or keep paying if a vulnerability went unnoticed. It’s likely the company is simply shoring up exploits its customers (which Motherboard reports pay up to $200,000 to retain Exodus’ services) may have before selling your discovery to Apple themselves, but that’s speculative.

Apple will pay up to $200,000 USD to researchers who discover and report iOS and iCloud bugs and security vulnerabilities. Apple is also offering successful researchers the option to donate bug bounty payments to charity which, at the company’s discretion, the company will match donations. Apple’s upcoming bug bounty program will initially be invite only with a select group of researchers providing reports on discovered bugs and security vulnerabilities. Screenshot of Apple iCloud - Image Credit: Apple Apple has categorized iOS and iCloud bugs and security vulnerabilities included in the program into five specific categories although the company may consider paying for other critical vulnerabilities. The highest paying category is “secure boot firmware components” which pays up to $200,000 USD. Researchers will need to report in detail the bugs and security vulnerabilities they discover and bounties will be based on a number of factors such as severity, how the bug or vulnerability is triggered, and how well the researcher describes the flaw. Apple is lagging behind when it comes to bug bounty programs as numerous technology companies including Facebook, Google, Microsoft, and Uber have been offering bug bounties for quite some time now. A great many companies have benefitted from their bug bounty programs providing financial and other types of incentives for white hat hackers to help improve the security of devices and applications. Apple plans on launching its new invite-only bug bounty program in September. Apple is starting out small with its bug bounty program; however, the program may be open to a greater number of participants in the future.

(CCM) — The future of Apple's bug bounty program has been plunged into doubt following the revelation that an exploit broker is offering more than twice as much as the company for information about vulnerabilities in iOS. Apple's bug bounty program, unveiled last week, provides rewards of up to $200,000 for vulnerabilities found in iOS, but Exodus Intelligence is offering up to $500,000 for previously unknown software flaws in iOS 9.3 or later versions. Exodus' "research sponsorship program" is open to anyone, and the company is willing to make payments by check, wire, Western Union, and Bitcoins, the latter of which allowing the recipient to remain anonymous. Contributors can choose to receive either a one-off fee for a vulnerability or periodic payments until the vulnerability is fixed. Corporate bug bounty programs such as Apple's are increasingly encountering competition from exploit brokers who buy vulnerabilities and sell information about them to clients and security companies, organizations that buy vulnerabilities to sell to hacker groups, and governments and law enforcement agencies that buy them for their own purposes. The FBI reportedly paid over $1 million for a vulnerability that enabled it to access the locked iPhone belonging to San Bernardino gunman Syed Farook.

The Indian Express Nation World Opinion Entertainment Lifestyle Technology Viral Photos Videos E-Paper Apps RSS Home Compare News Mobile & Tabs Gadgets Science Indian Express Home Home Technology Mobile & Tabs Apple’s iPhone 6s series beats Samsung Galaxy S7 in US sales: Kantar Apple’s iPhone 6s series beats Samsung Galaxy S7 in US sales: Kantar Apple's iOS saw growth in US and Europe's five big markets, thanks to the smaller iPhone SE, says Kantar. By: Tech Desk | Updated: August 11, 2016 4:07 pm Apple iPhone SE’s sales numbers have helped boost iOS growth in US, Europe. (Source: Reuters) Apple’s iPhone sales might be down, and there’s a lot riding with the iPhone 7 for Cupertino, but it appears the picture is not as bleak for the company. Apple’s iOS saw growth in US and Europe’s five big markets, with sales rising in the second quarter of 2016,  according to data from research firm Kantar Worldpanel ComTech. Kantar’s data says Apple iOS sales accounted for 31.8 per cent in US, and 18.2 per cent sale in Europe’s big main markets which includes, Britain, Germany, France, Italy and Spain. Interestingly the data shows iPhone SE, the 4-inch screen phone launched in March, became the third best-selling phone at 5.1 per cent in the US, which also added to iOS’s growth. The data adds iPhone 6s, and iPhone 6S totaled 15 per cent sales for the second quarter in the US making them the top selling devices for the quarter, while the Samsung Galaxy S7/S7 edge accounted for 14.1 per cent of sales. “In the US, iOS grew 1.3 percentage points year-over-year, accounting for 31.8% of smartphone sales in the second calendar quarter of 2016. Android accounted for 65.5% of smartphone sales, a small decline from the 66.1% of the same period a year ago,” reported Lauren Guenveur, Consumer Insight Director for Kantar Worldpanel ComTech. Interestingly in Great Britain, iPhone SE was the top-selling device in the quarter at 9.2 per cent, followed by iPhone 6s at 9.1 per cent. Both added 3.1 percentage points for iOS’s growth of 37.2 per cent in the quarter.

In Germany, iOS sales increased for the first time since the third quarter of 2015, up one percentage point to 14.2% of smartphone sales from 13.2% in the June period last year. These three markets combined, plus very slight declines in Italy and Spain, led iOS to grow across the EU5 by 0.7 percentage points. This represents the first period of increase since the three months ending November 2015,” said Dominic Sunnebo, Business Unit Director for Kantar Worldpanel ComTech Europe. Kantar’s numbers show iOS is increasing base in the developed markets, and iPhone SE appears to be an important device boosting this growth. However developing market like China are still seeing an year-on-year decline, shows Kantar’s data. Also see: Apple iPhone sales are down in Q3, and there’s a reason to worry “17.9% of smartphone sales in the period were iOS, a drop of 1.8 percentage points from 19.7 in the second quarter of 2015. What’s more, iOS share decline has also pushed Apple behind Huawei at 25.7% and Xiaomi at 18.5%,” said Tamsin Timpson, Strategic Insight Director at Kantar Worldpanel ComTech Asia. But iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s plus are the top selling smartphones in the region, though they face intense competition from Chinese players like Huawei, Xiaomi and Oppo. Also iPhone SE was unable to make an impact in the quarter due to constrained supply, says the research firm. Kantar says iOS growth will be interesting in Q3, especially if supply constraints are reduced further. The firm notes, iPhone 7’s upcoming launch in September means it will be a “weaker summer period for iOS.” But data also shows 49 per cent of US iPhone owners and 51 per cent of Chinese iPhones owners are on an iPhone 5s or older, meaning the opportunity to upgrade exists, says the research firm. For Apple, upgrade cycles are what boosts its numbers in the October-December quarter, although with iPhone 6s series it has not been so high. Apple CEO Tim Cook also admitted the iPhone 6S upgrade cycle was not as great as the iPhone 6 had been, which explains the slowdown to some extent. Apple has not given numbers of the iPhone SE sale for last quarter, but based on Kantar’s numbers it appears the phone has helped stem a drop in sales in Europe and US. © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd Express TechIE Samsung Galaxy S7 Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 Gionee S6 Xiaomi Mi 5 Best of Express 26/11 Stories of Strength presented by The Indian Express, Facebook & Instagram IndiaPakistan says three of its soldiers killed in cross border firing; 'response to ceasefire violations,' says Army BusinessHuge surge in Jan Dhan account deposits, Rs 21,000 crore mobilised IndiaNavjot Kaur Sidhu, Pargat Singh will join Congress on Nov 28: Amarinder Singh IndiaDemonetisation logjam: Govt reaches out to Opposition, PM likely to attend RS tomorrow BusinessFormer Tata Steel honcho rebuts Cyrus Mistry charges on Corus buy EntertainmentAlia Bhatt is like Jennifer Lawrence: a star who’s also terrific actor EntertainmentBefikre's song Khulke-Dhulke: Ranveer Singh, Vaani Kapoor and a Bollywood Punjabi wedding, watch video EntertainmentBaahubali 2 leaked scene may have done more good than harm EntertainmentSalman Khan meets his onscreen son Ali Haji after nine years.

Apple Declines, Samsung Grows, but iPhone Still Dominates Mobile World - Study GO Web traffic share shows changing trends in mobile business Aug 11, 2016 09:45 GMT  ·  By Bogdan Popa  ·  Share:  Apple has had a hard time keeping the iPhone a compelling product this year, especially following the arrival of the all-new Samsung Galaxy S7, and this struggle has reflected in the first declining quarter for iPhone sales since its official launch in 2007. And new research conducted by DeviceAtlas and analyzing web traffic share shows that the iPhone is indeed on the decline while Android in general, and Samsung in particular, is growing bigger these days. First and foremost, it’s worth noting that Apple continues to be the number one smartphone maker in several countries, but at the same time, the company also experienced declining numbers in Q2 in 18 out of the total 20 countries included in the survey. For instance, it lost 10 percent in the UK, 6 percent in Germany, and 4 percent in the US. Samsung, on the other hand, improved significantly during the quarter, and it posted impressive growths, exceeding 10 percent in countries such as France, the UK, and Australia. Saudi Arabia and Egypt are the only two countries where Samsung declined year-over-year. All hail the iPhone SE The arrival of the iPhone SE is keeping the 4-inch screen alive, and statistics show that an important part of today’s web traffic share goes to devices of this size. For example, 4-inch phones are the leading choice in Canada and very close to the top option in France, the UK, and the United States. “The web traffic share of the 4-inch screen size remains at a very high level in several countries, even though you might expect it to drop because there were very few 4-inch phones on offer. This is popularity is likely due to the newly released iPhone SE which is now the only widely sold 4-inch device,” the study shows. As for the battle between iOS and Android is concerned, you know the drill. Android is overall number one, but there still are countries where iOS is leading, according to these stats. For example, Australia, Canada, the UK, and the US are all about iPhones, DeviceAtlas claims, which somehow contradicts figures provided by other market research firms. But this is where it gets interesting. Data shows that the iPhone continues to be the most popular smartphone model around the world, despite new product launches from Samsung and other Android device manufacturers. This is because there are so many Android phones out there, the research shows, while in the case of iOS, it’s pretty easy to choose an iPhone because there are only a few options. And yet, Samsung has become the leading name in the Android world, but it’s still struggling to get closer to the iPhone, which continues to dominate the majority of mobile markets out there.

Home Business Software Chips Mobile Internet Security Review Desktop Software Graphics cards Laptops Mobile apps Mobiles Peripherals Storage Tablets Workstations TechEye Home Business Software Chips Mobile Internet Security Review Desktop Software Graphics cards Laptops Mobile apps Mobiles Peripherals Storage Tablets Workstations Menu Apple goes to war Posted on August 11, 2016 by Nick Farrell - News, Products Fruity cargo cult Apple has decided to weaponise some of its driving technology. The outfit has just scored a patent on a “steering device” on large vehicles with pivot joints to help them turn. While the idea is commonplace, Apple has tried to patent its use in a “war situation”. It all seems a bit weird.  In fact the US  Patent and Trademark Office granted the patent originally to BAE Systems Hägglunds Aktiebolag, a Swedish subsidiary of the huge global defence company which makes a little more sense. However somehow Jobs’ Mob has got in on it.  Neither BAE or Apple are saying anything so we are just left guessing. The invention is designed to better connect and steer two compartments of a vehicle inside a special “ballistic protection” enclosure.  It is a bit similar to the Swedish Army’s Bandvagn 202, an all-terrain truck which is two different vehicles tied together. The new tech will help steer the front and back units simultaneously. So why is Jobs’ Mob going to war?  The theory is that this sort of tech is designed first for defence departments but might be adapted for civilian purposes later.  So it could be used to drive an Apple Truck or Bus which we personally find more horrifying than a weapon designed by Jobs’ Mob.   Tags: apple, bae, weapon Search for: Recent Articles CIA-backed monitoring group fires half its staff A CIA-backed internet monitoring group has been forced to fire half its staff after it lost rights t[...] Aussies giving up piracy for legal streaming Aussie content pirates are giving up their torrenting now that big content has made legal streaming [...] Google is not a search engine for Nazis Google’s search engine might be part of a cunning liberal plot to suppress right wing thought, if a [...] Breitbart purged from advertising network One of the largest online advertising networks has purged Breitbart News due to hate speech.

Apple iPhone 7 Could Launch on September 7 GO Sales might begin in the week of September 12 Aug 11, 2016 09:23 GMT  ·  By Bogdan Popa  ·  Share:  Apple is expected to launch the new iPhone generation next month, and now, thanks to people with knowledge of the matter, we also have a date when this could happen. Bloomberg reports that September 7 is very likely to be the day when Apple will take the wraps off the new iPhone, but what’s important to know is that this is only the unveiling date, and not the one when the device will become available for purchase. Citing sources familiar with Apple’s plans, Bloomberg writes that “the new MacBook Pros aren’t likely to debut at an event currently scheduled for September 7 to introduce the next-generations versions of the iPhone,” so Apple is expected to use this event for the new iPhone exclusively. Sales starting in the week of September 12? Evan Blass, who keeps good track of information about unreleased mobile phones, including Apple’s iPhone, said in July that Cupertino planned to launch the new model in the week of September 12. Given this new Bloomberg report, this is very likely to be the time when pre-orders of the new device could begin. There are certainly many unknown details about the unveiling of the new iPhone, as there are sources claiming that the Apple Watch 2 could also be presented alongside this device, but for the moment, there’s still no confirmation from Cupertino (which obviously keeps everything secret and doesn’t want to spill the beans ahead of the public launch). Furthermore, there are many rumors regarding the name of the iPhone, as Blass himself has suggested that it’s unlikely to be called “iPhone 7,” since Apple wants to hold back this name for the 2017 model that’ll celebrate the 10th anniversary of the iPhone. As a result, names such as iPhone 6 SE are making more sense now, but once again, take everything with a little bit of skepticism, given Apple’s typical secrecy regarding upcoming products. #Apple#iPhone 7#iPhone#Apple Watch 2 subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news iOS Back to Growth As iPhone 6s Overtakes Samsung Galaxy S7 The “Jaw-Dropping” 2017 iPhone Will Be Fully Made of Glass Apple Wanted to Launch an iPhone 7 Pro This Year but Ditched the Plan - Report How the New iPhone 7 Dual-Camera System Could Work iPhone 8 to Feature Traditional Wireless Charging like the Samsung Galaxy S7 Lenovo Builds a New Microsoft Surface Clone and It Looks Fabulous Anonymous Hackers Want McAfee to Be Trump’s Security Adviser, Call for March Hackers Could Infect Headphones to Spy on You HTC Desire 650 Announced, a Low Mid-End Smartphone for the Masses Glossy Black Galaxy S7 edge Leaks in Live Pictures Download Windows 10 64-bit Drivers for Acer’s Aspire TC-710 Desktop Model Intel Rolls Out Several New BIOS Versions for Its NUC Kits and Compute Sticks    Alleged schematic of the new iPhone new ios apps NeuroNation: Train your brain to improve your memory and focus with NeuroNation Flipagram: Create cool videos by mixing up your photos with music Timer+: Set up dozens of timers and control them all with ease Nutshell Camera: Create some pretty cool videos with Nutshell Camera IKEA Catalogue: Check out the IKEA Catalogue for more than just furniture Complete: Complete puts a social twist to your regular to-do list/ task manager WebMD Baby: WebMD Baby offers help in how to best tend to your baby Reader comments Apple Discontinues AirPort and Time Capsule Products, Entire Division Disbanded more on: Apple i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

Skip to content Patent Blog Jobs Ethics Journal America's leading patent law source Search for: Apple v. Samsung: Justifying Profit Disgorgement August 11, 2016PatentDennis Crouch Apple has filed its merits brief defending the longstanding principle of profit-disgorgement as a remedy for design patent infringement. [AppleResponse] The statute states that an adjudged infringer “shall be liable to the owner to the extent of his total profit.” 35 U.S.C. 289.  Apple argues that the lower courts are correct in finding that Samsung should be liable for profits associated with sales of its Galaxy phones that were adjudged to be infringing Apple’s iPhone design patents. Apple writes: The only issue before this Court is whether Samsung will be able to avoid fairly compensating Apple for its adjudicated infringement. Samsung takes aim at 35 U.S.C. § 289, which provides that a design patent infringer is “liable … to the extent of his total profit” on the “article of manufacture” to which the patented design has been applied. Congress enacted this remedy because it recognized that “it is the design that sells the article” and, because profits attributable to design are often “not apportionable,” “[i]t is expedient that the infringer’s entire profit on the article should be recoverable, as otherwise none of his profit can be recovered.” 18 Cong. Rec. 834 (1887). As the Solicitor General correctly notes (Br. 10-15), Samsung’s effort to read an apportionment requirement into § 289 is at odds not only with the statute’s plain language, but also with Congress’s contemporaneous explanation that the remedy was enacted in response to decisions of this Court taking exactly the approach Samsung now advocates. And as the government also correctly explains (Br. 16-31), identification of the relevant “article of manufacture” on which § 289 allows an award of total profit is a factual question for the jury on which the defendant bears the burden of proof. . . . Samsung invokes highly speculative policy grounds that it believes justify upending the settled interpretation of a statutory remedy first adopted in 1887, readopted in 1952, and left unchanged since then. Samsung’s arguments are addressed to the wrong branch of government: It is not for this Court to decide whether to alter the statutory balance that Congress has chosen and left undisturbed for decades. Samsung’s farfetched hypotheticals are just that; and they ignore the reality of this case. Samsung is a sophisticated company that chose to copy the design innovations of its biggest competitor and profited significantly from doing so. That is precisely the type of conduct Congress long ago decided deserves an effective remedy. What makes this case so big is the numbers involved – Here, the profits disgorged are hundreds of millions of dollars. Noted design patent attorney Perry Saidman filed an amicus brief supporting Apple’s case on behalf of a group of companies that rely upon design patents in their business.  Saidman argues that design patents are critical to allow companies to protect ‘visually striking products’, and that the profit disgorgement “gives teeth to design patents” in a way that promotes settlements.   [AppleSaidman] An additional supportive brief was filed on behalf of a group of “113 distinguished industrial design professionals and educators.”  The brief – filed by Mark Davies – argues that a product’s visual design is critically important in the sales of complex products. “[A] product’s visual design has powerful effects on the human mind and decision making processes, and eventually comes to signify to the consumer the underlying function, origin, and overall user experience of that product. [AppleDesigners] The these two friend-of-the-court briefs are interesting in that they essentially make the same argument that I made in my old paper on Design Patents as Trademarks. = = = = = Oral arguments for the case are set for October 11, 2016 in Washington DC.

Samsung: Justifying Profit Disgorgement” 7 J says: August 25, 2016 at 8:06 am I’m curious to everyone’s opinion: with trade dress, what exactly IS the purpose for granting design patents? 6 MM says: August 11, 2016 at 6:52 pm I’d be curious to know what design patents looked like in, say, 1885 (when this portion of the statute was apparently drafted), how many patents were applied for, how many were granted, what the examination was like, and what sort of lawsuits were being filed. Did Ford ever get sued for infringing the ornamental design of, say, the steering wheel or door handles on the Model T? Anybody know? Or maybe Ford just settled with the patentee because of the massive potential damages? 6.1 Pilgrim says: August 12, 2016 at 5:55 pm You can see images of early design patents using the PTO’s patent number search. For example, “D2” is a design patent from 1843 for a design impressed into a metal comb “which consists of a female figure having in her hands and over her head festoons of flowers in which is inscribed the motto ‘Forget me not’ …” D016000 is from 1885 – a floral design for carpets 6.1.1 MM says: August 12, 2016 at 6:43 pm Wow. Actual ornamentation. And nothing at all like Apple’s junk. 6.1.1.1 anon says: August 12, 2016 at 9:53 pm What…? No indignation at someone grubbing, er, grabbing a design patent for a female figure or for floral designs….? Maybe some samples from Ancient Greece are in order…. 6.1.1.1.1 MM says: August 13, 2016 at 5:34 pm No indignation at someone grubbing, er, grabbing a design patent for a female figure or for floral designs….? I haven’t seen the claims. I wasn’t referring to their potential obviousness. I was referring to the fact that the designs are ornamental in character. You know, as opposed to a handheld computer display that’s (be sure to sit down!) rectangular with curved corners. Maybe some samples from Ancient Greece are in order…. Go for it. 6.1.1.1.1.1 anon says: August 13, 2016 at 6:32 pm You do not think that the (arbitrary) shape of and object is ornamental…? O Rly? Just what does your “junky” meter run on? Never mind – I really don’t want to know. 6.1.1.1.1.1.1 MM says: August 15, 2016 at 2:31 pm (arbitrary) shape LOL! Love the parentheses. Love them! Sure, rounded corners and a rectangular shape are totally arbritary choices for a display. LOLOLOLOLOLOL But you’re a very serious person. … anon says: August 15, 2016 at 2:46 pm Once again, your “poker tell” gives you away. You really need to work on that. 5 A plurality of thresholding units says: August 11, 2016 at 11:29 am Saidman argues that design patents are critical to allow companies to protect ‘visually striking products’ Visually striking, you say. You mean like round corners? 5.1 Paul F. Morgan says: August 11, 2016 at 11:57 am That is actually arguing that a proper 103 test for design patents is the issue that should be before the Supremes here, rather than just design patent infringement damages. You are not the only one who thinks that, but it cannot now be done in this case. WHY not is a very good question for Samsung’s attorneys. 5.1.1 MM says: August 11, 2016 at 12:19 pm Refresh my memory: did Samsung pile a petition for cert on the obviousness issue? 5.1.1.1 Perry Saidman says: August 12, 2016 at 6:46 am No. They agreed the patents were valid and infringed. 5.1.1.1.1 MM says: August 13, 2016 at 5:41 pm PS They agreed the patents were valid and infringed. … after spending a zillion dollars arguing that the patents weren’t valid or infringed. “Agreed” kinda fudges the history here. The actual facts are more like “Samsung made a business decision that continuing to fight over those issues wasn’t worth the expense.” 5.1.1.1.1.1 anon says: August 13, 2016 at 6:34 pm There is no “fudging history” except your attempt to somehow not come to the proper conclusion of things. Another instance of inconvenient facts for you there Malcolm. 5.1.1.1.1.1.1 MM says: August 15, 2016 at 2:32 pm There is no “fudging history” Because “anon” said so! And he discussed this history himself, after all. Oh, except that he didn’t. Oops! Probably just forgot. Sure he did. He’s a very serious person! … anon says: August 15, 2016 at 2:49 pm The history and point that you are avoiding HAS been presented at 5.1.1.1: “They agreed the patents were valid and infringed.” That’s not something that you can make disappear with snippets of the case. 4 MM says: August 11, 2016 at 10:44 am From Apple’s brief: Congress enacted this remedy because it recognized that “it is the design that sells the article” Sometimes. It depends on the nature of the article and the specifics of design. For utilitarian objects, it’s almost always not the design that sells the article. Anybody who tells you otherwise has been sm0king way too much design patent crxp. What sells utlitarian articles in most cases is (1) a lower price with similar functionality compared to competitors and (2) product placement/advertising/packaging. Nobody’s paying $20 more for a thumb drive because, e.g., they like the cute star embossed on the surface. because profits attributable to design are often “not apportionable,” In fact they’re just as apportionable as utility features. You just have to poll prospective consumers and ask the right questions, e.g., “How much more would you pay if the object had this design?” Maybe back in 1887 this seemed super mysterious but it doesn’t anymore. Again: this problem is going to be fixed and, at the end of the day, it really doesn’t matter what Apple or some “distinguished industrial designers” think about the “value” of their designs. 4.1 anon says: August 11, 2016 at 10:53 am What exactly is this “problem to be fixed”…? Methinks that you might think that the problem is the law itself. That’s just not something for the courts to fix. No matter how that makes you feel. 4.1.1 MM says: August 11, 2016 at 10:58 am Methinks Nobody cares what you think about anything, “anon.” 4.1.1.1 anon says: August 11, 2016 at 11:44 am Maybe you should – since this is a blog on patent law and not patent “feelings,” you would do well to pay attention. 4.2 Ned Heller says: August 11, 2016 at 11:13 am MM, “For utilitarian objects, it’s almost always not the design that sells the article. ” Obviously, MM is not a girl. 4.2.1 MM says: August 11, 2016 at 12:15 pm Ned: MM, “For utilitarian objects, it’s almost always not the design that sells the article. ” Obviously, MM is not a girl Right. I’m an adult with a budget. Let’s get some history straight: was Apple able to get its initial foothold in the public education system, where many peopel first were exposed to its operating system, because of the ornamentation of its computers? Of course not. How did it happen? Jobs lobbied legislatures for new laws that would give the company a tax credit for donating computer equipment to schools. And then Apple gave their computers away. So much for the power of those “striking designs”. See, e.g.: link to hackeducation.com for more info. Corporations create myths about themselves and they spend hundreds of millions of dollars shoving those myths into your brain. Some of Apple’s ornamentation is nice. But a lot of their ornamentation was (and is) b u t t u g l y. 4.2.1.1 6 says: August 11, 2016 at 12:31 pm “Right. I’m an adult with a budget.” MM has a budget? I’m calling BS. Either way, I think it’s fair to say that I likely bought my old Iphone likely because it looked the cools (ornamentation). The google androids were out too at that time and I didn’t get one of those. 4.2.1.1.1 MM says: August 12, 2016 at 2:25 pm I likely bought my old Iphone likely because it looked the cools (ornamentation). The particular degree of curvature of those rounded corners really impressed you, huh? I bet you’re a big connoisseur of d00rknobs, too. link to mcsweeneys.net Bruce Gerrie is the organizer of “Jewelry for Buildings: The Art of Antique Doorknobs,” an exhibit that examines doorknobs within an historical and technological context, addressing design, craftsmanship, function, and classification. … Q: So has the doorknob been improved since the early 1900s? Gerrie: I don’t think so. There was tremendous quality control back then. Craftsmen were interested in doing their best. They were more concerned with the quality than the cost. Along with technology and catalogs, quality is what got doorknobs into people’s houses. 100 years of design patents => squat Clearly we need more of them! And more damages. Lots more damages. This has nothing to do with David Kappos trying to line his wallet. Nope. 4.2.1.1.1.1 anon says: August 12, 2016 at 5:13 pm What? People want to use patents to make money? O h N o e s ! ! ! ! ! /off sardonic bemusement 4.3 Ned Heller says: August 11, 2016 at 11:22 am Actually, Steve Jobs sought to differentiate (Apple) products from other, similar products, based on design, particularly of their casings. He succeeded. 4.3.1 MM says: August 11, 2016 at 11:58 am Ned: Steve Jobs sought to differentiate (Apple) products from other, similar products, based on design, particularly of their casings. He succeeded. I’m not suggesting that people haven’t succeeded in branding or distinguishing their products with a design choice (I’m pretty sure nobody is suggesting that). The issue is : to what extent were purchases of a device driven by the ornamental design of some aspect of the device? Years ago, did I buy Apple’s u g l y and functionally counterproductive teardrop shaped wireless router because it was “visually striking”? Nope. I bought it because I thought it would be the easiest and most reliable router for my Mac. That was a poor decision and a waste of money, by the way. 4.3.1.1 6 says: August 11, 2016 at 12:32 pm “my Mac” This explains many of MM’s views on compooting. 4.3.1.1.1 MM says: August 11, 2016 at 12:45 pm LOL 4.3.1.2 Ned Heller says: August 11, 2016 at 1:44 pm MM, one of the things I have found out about Apple is that they do not always or even usually put the best technology into their products, especially if that technology has nothing to do with “look and feel.” 4.3.1.3 Ned Heller says: August 11, 2016 at 1:52 pm On the “prove the demand” issue, I think the reforms of 1887 or such were intended to remove that item of proof and provide instead a categorical presumption that the reason for the purchase by the consumer was because of the patented design. 3 MM says: August 11, 2016 at 10:31 am As summarized, Saidman’s brief presentes little more than a generic excuse for raising damages across the board, in every case. More people will settle … because higher damages! design patents are critical to allow companies to protect ‘visually striking products’ Whether or not that’s true, it has nothing to do with this case. Neither Apple’s design nor Samsung’s design is “visually striking” (not when compared to the prior art, anyway). And the designs (“rounded corners”, as I recall) are not what’s motivating people to pay hundreds of dollars for either company’s phones. There was also nothing “visually striking” about the placement of hinges on Nordock’s “dock leveler”. Nobody purchased either party’s “dock levelers” because they were impressed by the “ornamantal” choice of hinge location relative to competing brands. US design patent law is a j0ke and the system is staring at the abyss, ready to melt down just as the utility patent system did when Judge Rich and Kappos opened the gates to litigious vermin without a clue. If the Supreme Court doesn’t fix this silliness, then Congress will have to do it. [shrugs] 3.1 anon says: August 11, 2016 at 10:41 am “If the Supreme Court doesn’t fix this silliness, then Congress will have to do it.” Let’s use the proper means to your desired ends. See post 1 below. 3.2 Perry Saidman says: August 12, 2016 at 7:06 am MM: show me the prior art that contained an array of colorful icons, a visually striking, groundbreaking, earth shattering design if there ever was one, a design that (the evidence clearly showed) Samsung intentionally copied to stay in the smartphone game, a design that was patented by Apple and intentionally infringed by Samsung, who now complains that they should not have to pay the piper for having its hand caught in the cookie jar. The original 2007 iPhone was an incredible visual advance – who doesn’t remember the photo of someone’s right hand (the fingers on the left side of the phone, the thumb on the right side) holding the iPhone showing the array of colorful icons? Regarding Nordock’s dock leveler design, the court disagreed with you: check out footnote 32 of my brief. 3.2.1 anon says: August 12, 2016 at 7:52 am B-b-but Perry, Malcolm’s feelings are all the evidence he needs (all that he has!) to prove that he is right (in his own mind) as usual. He has chosen “noble” ends, so it just does not matter the means to those ends. 3.2.2 MM says: August 12, 2016 at 10:16 am the prior art that contained an array of colorful icons That would be my desktop display. visually striking, groundbreaking, earth shattering design We’re talking ornamentation here. From an ornamentation perspective, here’s absolutely nothing “groundbreaking” or “earth shattering” (LOL) about a hand-sized rectangular box with round corners. Of course it displays icons. Everybody knows what icons are for. a design that (the evidence clearly showed) Samsung intentionally copied There’s nothing wrong with copying obvious ornamental designs. People do it all the time. 3.2.2.1 anon says: August 12, 2016 at 11:04 am Maybe you missed the part where Samsung admitted to the design patent being valid…. (Kind of changes the “just copying” thing) 3.2.2.1.1 MM says: August 12, 2016 at 2:12 pm Maybe you missed the part where Samsung admitted to the design patent being valid…. Can you remind everybody: was that before or after Samsung argued in court that the patent wasn’t valid? Deciding not to appeal an issue really doesn’t mean squat, particular when the company is patenting the exact same kind of junk. This is not a new concept in the patent legal world. Apple wants a chunk of Samsung’s hide is really all that’s going on here. Put the shoe on Apple’s foot and Apple will happily shoot it full of holes if it makes business sense for Apple. link to theverge.com [Samsung’s expert] showed four examples of prior art when discussing the iPhone, including two Japanese design patents, a Korean design patent, and the LG Prada — all of which pre-dated the iPhone. All of the examples feature rectangular shapes with rounded corners and centered screens. 3.2.2.1.1.1 anon says: August 12, 2016 at 3:44 pm You seem to be having trouble with the concept of “They admitted that the patent was valid and infringed. You look real cute parsing parts of the case, but you missed a pretty important one (and I love the insinuation of some grand scheme that everyone wants design patents so no one is going to “fight” too strongly – that’s a real winner, right next to your pointy shiny aluminum hat). 3.2.2.1.1.1.1 MM says: August 13, 2016 at 5:49 pm You seem to be having trouble with the concept of “They admitted that the patent was valid and infringed./i> Not at all. People “admit” all kinds of stuff in court, for all kinds of reasons. Have you heard of plea bargaining? Look it up. More importantly, you’re the one who seems to be “having trouble with the concept.” Here it is again: there’s nothing wrong with copying an obvious design. I did it just now! You say you have a design patent on what I just did? That’s nice. If you sue me, you’re going to be forced very very quickly to drop the case or engage in sanctionable behavior. And you’ll be paying my fees. Do you understand “the concept”, “anon”? Gee, I hope so. After all, the “concept” has been crushing your dreams for years now. But keep pretending otherwise! You’re a very serious person. [shrugs] … anon says: August 13, 2016 at 6:37 pm Lol – lots of words – meaning nothing (hint; your poker tell of “so serious” have you away again – you should work on that). 2 paul szabo says: August 11, 2016 at 7:28 am Apple’s brief is grossly misleading. It states right up front: “Whether 35 U.S.C. § 289, which provides that a party that infringes a design patent may be held “liable … to the extent of his total profit” on articles of manufacture to which the patented design is applied…” That is a false an misleading recitation of the statutory language. The statute actually discusses the application of a patented design to article of manufacture, then says, “shall be liable to the owner to the extent of his total profit, but not less than $250, recoverable in any United States district court having jurisdiction of the parties.” Thus, the statute does not say “total profit on the article of manufacture”. Rather, it leaves open the question of what the profit is ON—that is, what is the base on which the profit is to be figured. An example where this distinction comes into play is the common patent license agreement provision that calculates a royalty on the “value added to a retail product by applying a patented invention”, rather than on the full retail price of the entire product. Have I missed something? Has this point been parsed before in court cases? If not, then why is Apple intentionally misleading the Supreme Court? 2.1 anon says: August 11, 2016 at 8:10 am Paul, I do not see the addition of the “floor” amount as in any way creating the “falsity” that you claim to be present. Can you explain why you feel the brief is misleading with a little more particularity? (The brief counters your “value add” directly, by the way) Thanks 2.1.1 paul szabo says: August 11, 2016 at 4:25 pm Yes, as explained in the note below, the Apple brief (at least the first page) states that the statues provides for “total profit on article of manufacture”. That is an incorrect recitation of the statue, and to my mind is intended to mislead. They are eliding the entire point of the case: what base is the profit be be counted on ? Just shifty lawyering, I guess, but it sure puts a bad taste in this reader’s mouth,. 2.1.1.1 anon says: August 11, 2016 at 4:44 pm Their position is that the statute does NOT leave open what base the profit is to be on. That is not a misreading of the statute (contrary to your desired read – which every bit can be taken as a misread). 2.2 alex s. says: August 11, 2016 at 9:54 am Whoever during the term of a patent for a design, without license of the owner, (1) applies the patented design, or any colorable imitation thereof, to any article of manufacture for the purpose of sale, or (2) sells or exposes for sale any article of manufacture to which such design or colorable imitation has been applied shall be liable to the owner to the extent of his total profit, but not less than $250, recoverable in any United States district court having jurisdiction of the parties. Nothing in this section shall prevent, lessen, or impeach any other remedy which an owner of an infringed patent has under the provisions of this title, but he shall not twice recover the profit made from the infringement. I agree the statute does not explicitly connect the “total profit” to the “article of manufacture”, but that doesn’t mean the courts are free to disregard the other language present. An alternate way of understanding the statute is to connect total profit to “for the purpose of sale, or (2) sells or exposes for sale” (which makes sense because sale = profit, usually) and the sale phrase is directly connected to articles of manufacture. 2.2.1 Tal Benschar says: August 11, 2016 at 11:54 am ” to the extent of his total profit” What is the word “total” meant to convey? It sure sounds like an expansion over some alternative, less-than-total amount. Any legislative history about what “total” was meant to do? How does Samsung’s position account for that word? 2.2.1.1 Perry Saidman says: August 15, 2016 at 8:25 am Total means total. Which means no apportionment. Samsung wants apportionment. Congress said no apportionment back in 1887 when they adopted the total profit remedy. If Samsung wants that changed, go back to Congress (which is likely where Samsung is heading regardless of what happens in SCOTUS). 2.2.1.1.1 Tal Benschar says: August 15, 2016 at 12:36 pm Yes, that is Apple’s position, and I agree that the word “total” is a strong argument for it. Question in my mind is how does Samsung account for that word. I have yet to see that addressed. If Samsung can’t deal with that word, then I think it will and should lose. 2.2.1.1.1.1 anon says: August 15, 2016 at 1:11 pm If they can’t – or won’t – deal with it, maybe they should be sanctioned… 1 anon says: August 11, 2016 at 6:25 am “Samsung’s arguments are addressed to the wrong branch of the government. It is not for this Court to decide whether to alter the statutory balance…” Where have seen this concept before? Ah yes, 35 USC 101. See Chakrabarty. Contrast with the dissent dressed as a concurrence in Bilski. 1.1 Paul F. Morgan says: August 11, 2016 at 12:10 pm Chakrabarty specifically lists as exceptions to 101 the several prior Sup. Ct. decisions on unpatentable subject matter. 1.1.1 anon says: August 11, 2016 at 1:00 pm What else does it say, Mr. Morgan? Comments are closed.

More than just technology news Home Tech Reviews Science Games Culture Video Stay Connected Facebook Twitter RSS Updated Hot Tags Pokemon Go Pokemon Sun And Moon Apple Pokemon Sun And Moon news Pokemon Go Update Logitech Creates Keyboard For The 9.7-inch iPad Pro, Makes It Lightest Laptop Available Adie Pie First Posted: Aug 11, 2016 03:50 AM EDT An Apple Inc. iPad Pro 9.7 inch is displayed at the company's Omotesando store on March 31, 2016 in Tokyo, Japan. Apple Inc. launched its iPhone SE and iPad Pro 9.7 inch on March 31, 2016 in Japan. (Tomohiro Ohsumi/Getty Images) Earlier this month, Apple released a campaign that claimed the iPad Pro was as good, if not better, than a computer. Of course, using the gadget as a notebook means that there is a need for a complimenting accessory. Fortunately, Logitech has released the ideal and most efficient partner for the 9.7-inch iPad Pro. The Verge notes that Apple actually released the larger 13-inch iPad Pro with a snap-on keyboard of its own. However, it somehow defeated the purpose of a more portable device, simply because the iPad itself was relatively large. In addition, there were issues with the Apple-issued keyboard itself. The Apple keyboard was uncomfortable to the touch, lacked backlighting and was absent of any iPad-specific control keys. Apple's release of the 9.7-inch iPad Pro solved the size issue. Unfortunately, there was still that same, inefficient keyboard - it was just smaller. The wait was relatively a long one, but a company has finally released an ample keyboard. Logitech created tha Create 9.7, which not only suits the 9.7-inch iPad Pro better, but also costs less than Apple's own Smart Keyboard. The Logitech device is only $129.99, fitting the Apple gadget perfectly at 7.0 in x 9.8 in x 0.9 all around and weighing in at only 426 grams. It comes in a black and blue variant. Logitech also created a keyboard that is compatible with the 12.9-inch iPad Pro and is priced at $149.99. This one is 12.4 in x 9.05 in x 0.78 in and is 725 grams. It comes in a red/gold, blue/silver, black/silver, violet/black and pure black options.  The Logitech Create has plenty of features that the Apple Smart Keyboard does not have. Firstly, it has real, movable keys, which give the user the same feeling as if typing on a real laptop. Second, it has a backlight and an Apple Pencil holder, which make it very efficient. Lastly, it has a row of shortcut keys which include brightness, volume and media playback. Related Articles iPad Pro 2 To Make 2016 MacBook Pro Obsolete Before It Even Hits The Market?

But now a Bloomberg report more than confirms it. It says that Apple will launch iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Pro on September 7. Some earlier reports had suggested that the next generation of iPhones will hit stores from September 9 or September 16. But this report seems more in line with Apple's way of doing things. The company had launched iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus on September 9 last year, which was also a Wednesday. While there's no end to rumours surrounding iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, some of them have appeared so often that it'd be a surprise if they don't come true. Also read: Update MacBook Pro with radical new design, features coming soon: Report Another Bloomberg report has left close to no doubts about the upcoming iPhones. According to the report, the iPhone will have dual camera but no there will be no 3.5mm audio jack. The report suggests that the bigger iPhone, which we believe is called iPhone 7 Plus, will have a dual-camera setup on the back, while both the iPhones will come with a redesigned home button. Unlike iPhone 6S and 6S Plus, the home button in the upcoming phones will not be a clickable button. Instead it will be flush with the phone's body and will respond to pressure rather than a physical click. The home button is expected to carry the fingerprint scanner inside. The report suggests that the phones will look similar to iPhone 6 and iPhone 6S with incremental changes in design. The company also plans to keep the 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch screen sizes for the new phones. Leaked photos of the phones show a few changes in the design. Both the phones are expected to have antenna lines shifted towards the edges. While there's little known about the innards of the phone, reports have suggested that iPhone 7 will come with A10 processor, which could be as powerful as iPad Pro tablet.

Reuters/Stephen Lam Apple has lashed out at three of Australia’s biggest banks for refusing Apply Pay and attempting to access iPhone’s digital wallet access. Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA), National Australia Bank (NAB) and Westpac Banking Corp want their own digital wallets access on iOS, but Apple has argued against it. The three banks have appealed to the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission to allow them to challenge Apple’s monopoly of its iPhone digital wallet. They want the ACCC to intervene on their behalf and force Apple to open the access to its NFC antenna. Apple doesn’t want to do that, saying it would compromise the security of its smartphone system. In a letter response to ACCC’s invitation to express its views, the company said it would not allow external parties to determine its hardware and software decisions. “Apple strongly urges the Commission to reject the request of the applicants for interim authorisation,” it wrote in the letter. “If granted, the request would harm consumers, lead to less competition and less innovation, and create troubling precedent.” It explained that the banks have little knowledge into Apple Pay or Apple’s terms, citing a case wherein one unnamed applicant bank has refused to enter into a confidentiality agreement with the company before participating in Apple Pay, The banks, which Apple claimed have formed a “cartel” against it, have threatened to collectively boycott the service. As Digital Trends explains, the banks do not want to forfeit the millions of dollars they would earn through interchange fees, which would go to Apple. Hence, they want the Cupertino, California, company to bend to their terms, which would therefore allow them to charge people who use Apple Pay. “Now they ask the ACCC for explicit permission to negotiate with Apple as a collective group. The goal of which is to force Apple and other third party providers to accept their terms, allow them to charge consumers that choose to use Apple Pay, and force Apple to undermine the security of its mobile payment service by opening access to the NFC antenna, placing at risk the consumer experience of a simple, secure and private way to make payments in store, within applications, or on the web.” ACCC plans to announce a decision on NFC next month, but Apple wants to delay it to accommodate the 6-month statutory period for assessment. Apple Pay is available in Australia through ANZ, the only bank that entered a deal with the company. It is understood that ANZ shares its interchange fees with Apple, although the terms of their contract are not disclosed.

By Aimee Chanthadavong | August 11, 2016 -- 07:24 GMT (00:24 PDT) | Topic: Banking The South Australian Small Business Commissioner John Chapman has signalled he opposes giving some of Australia's big banks the authority to collectively negotiate with third-party mobile wallet providers, such as Apple, on conditions relating to competition, best practice standards, and efficiency and transparency. The Commonwealth Bank of Australia, National Australia Bank, Westpac, and Bendigo and Adelaide have all lodged applications collectively requesting for the ACCC to grant initial interim authorisation within 28 days to allow them to commence negotiations on limited issues while the consumer watchdog considers the application for authorisation. Latest Australian news ​Government should protect Australian businesses from cybercrime: Shorten eSafety commissioner to organise uniform penalties for revenge porn Cronulla Sharks chose the data-driven road to an NRL grand final victory NBN signs NetComm Wireless for FttDP equipment ​Flights resume after Melbourne Airport 'network connectivity' issue The main goals the banks want to achieve through negotiations include ensuring there will be non-exclusive access to a mobile near-field communication (NFC) chip, which would open up opportunities for other third parties, such as retailer loyalty programs or transit companies, to access the wallet; standardised security standards across the mobile payment system; and price transparency for payment system transaction costs in Australia, which is in line with the Reserve Bank of Australia's policy. In his initial submission to the ACCC, Chapman has raised questions around why the banks have deliberately avoided the "thorny issue" of fee negotiations from their application, leaving fee negotiations up to individual banks to negotiate with wallet providers. "To me, the applicants' reluctance to agitate the fees that they may need to pay to Apple (or how those fees might need to be recouped for their shareholders), is a telling indicator of the applicants' reluctance to shine any light on issues that may have the potential to cause them public discomfort," he said. Chapman believes the banks, including ANZ -- currently the only bank out of the big four supporting Apple Pay in Australia -- will inevitably seek to recoup any fees or charges they give up to Apple, by recovering them from merchants, consumers, or both. He said this inkling of how attached the banks are to fees and charges in their "relentless pursuit of profits" was exemplified when ANZ recently won a long-running class action battle on fees in the High Court that resulted in them able to continue charging customers late payment fees. In turn, Chapman has urged for the ACCC to include fee negotiations as part of its final decision. "Whilst the applicants have declined to include fee negotiations in its application, it is my submission that this is an extremely relevant matter which should properly be within the contemplation of the ACCC in its deliberation. Chapman also pointed out the authorisation may potentially backfire on the banks as it is currently unclear whether Apple would even enter into negotiations if the ACCC granted them interim authorisation. Additionally, Chapman raised doubts around the need for the urgent authorisation that would also allow the banks to put their mobile banking apps onto the iPhone, saying how the CBA, for instance, has already "identified and implemented a practicable and effective 'work around' solution" with its PayTag sticker, designed to be stuck on the back of iOS devices to enable customers to tap and pay. "In my view this is simply a case whereby powerful banks are simply not used to having to accede to another, more powerful organisation -- Apple, a global company that has the smarts and the resources to be able to simply ignore the banks' demands," he said. This was a similar argument Apple made in its submission to the ACCC accusing the banks' real motivation behind their request is to "maintain complete control over their customers", and force Apple and other third-party providers to accept their terms, which it believes would allow the banks to charge consumers that choose to use Apple Pay. "The present application is only the latest tactic employed by these competing banks to blunt Apple's entry into the Australian market," it said.

X Apple’s difficulty could be rival Samsung’s opportunity The two companies have been battling to be top smartphone maker for several years Thu, Aug 11, 2016, 05:48 Ciara O'Brien Samsung has had its tough spells in recent years as some of its flagship handsets failed to hit the market with consumers, but the current Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge is galvanising the company A visitor tries a Galaxy Note 7, the newest phablet from Samsung Electronics, submerged under water in Taipei Previous Image Next Image         For a while there Apple could do no wrong. The company was turning in incredible sales and growth figures every quarter for the iPhone and iPad, investors were happy and its stock price rocketed. It was the most valuable company in the world, overtaking Exxon and holding off brief challenges from Google’s parent Alphabet. But it was a trajectory that couldn’t last. At some point the sales were bound to plateau as Apple saturated the market with its products, limiting Apple’s potential to grow sales, and put in the kind of figures that kept investors happy. That much was evident in the past couple of quarters, when Apple turned in sales figures that were lower than previous reporting periods and failed to meet investor demands for ever higher growth. In the second quarter of the year the company saw its sales growth stalled for the first time since the launch of the iPhone in 2007. It sold 51.2 million iPhones in the three-month period, some 10 million fewer than the previous year. Expectations The third quarter, reported last week, fared a little better. Apple sold 40.4 million iPhones, in line with expectations, and net profit was $.8 billion (€7.1bn) in the quarter. That was a drop of 15 per cent and 27 per cent respectively. Part of the decline is being attributed to the tick-tock approach Apple has to product development: a new product, such as the iPhone 6 one year; the internal overhaul a year later. Regardless, the end result is Apple’s previously smooth path has become a little rocky of late. Contrast that with Samsung’s latest results. The Korean company reported second-quarter profit that beat expectations, with stronger sales of the S7 smartphone and aggressive cost-cuts helping lift results. Net income was 5.83 trillion won (€4.66bn). ADVERTISEMENT Does Apple’s difficult period present an opportunity for rival Samsung? The two companies have been battling for the title of top smartphone maker for several years, and it has become an increasingly bitter war. Not only has it been fought in the consumer arena, but it has been dragged into the courts too, with patent infringement actions coming from both sides. Clever cube makes for easier shared viewing Instagram takes on Snapchat with live, ‘disappearing’ video How to . . . help out your smartphone battery Samsung has had its tough spells in recent years as some of its flagship handsets failed to hit the market with consumers, but the current Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge is galvanising the company. And now it has the Note 7, which was announced earlier this week. Like Apple with the tablet sector, the “phablet” sector, as it has come to be known, is something that Samsung has been involved in from the very beginning. It was its first Note device that began Samsung’s march toward larger screened devices, and as other manufacturers followed suit, Apple was eventually forced to fall in line, launching the iPhone 6 Plus in 2014. Samsung is concentrating, like Blackberry, on a few of Android’s perceived weaknesses. The new Note comes with beefed up security, using Samsung Knox to lock down your private files and encrypt the system. Prying eyes There is also Secure Folder, an area where you can drop your files and apps that you want to keep away from prying eyes. It’s easy enough to do. In a demo a Samsung rep showed how to transfer photos through selecting the images you would like to move, pressing the menu button and selecting the option to move them to a secure folder. Of course, live demos being live demos, it wouldn’t work when screen mirroring was switched on, but performed fine once it was disabled. It’s not just about hiding files, though. You can have an email account in there on an app, while having a separate account on the same email app outside the secure folder. The system essentially duplicates the app and maintains both as if they are two separate programmes. This will come in handy for those using this as both a work and personal device, with more sensitive email accounts and files living inside this secure folder. Samsung is also trying out new security features such as the iris scanner that will allow you to unlock your phone without laying a finger on it. Once you have your iris registered all it takes is a press of a button to wake the phone, look at it, and it unlocks in seconds. Encryption Apple, for its part, has been vocal about respecting consumers’ privacy and security, and has backed up its words with actions. It fought back against FBI requests to break encryption on iPhones in the investigation into the San Bernadino killings because of the implications for other users. One thing that is tough to overcome is the fierce loyalty that Apple inspires from its fans. And while there is a core of Apple users who would never consider jumping ship to another platform, not everyone is of the same opinion. Apple chief executive Tim Cook was keen to highlight the strong “switcher” market in the last quarter, where Android users were abandoning Google’s platform and moving to iPhone. Apple introduced an app that would help with migrating user information from the rival platform. There are few figures to indicate what the shift is like the other way, although anecdotal evidence shows that it happens. With the newly announced Note 7, Samsung may have the momentum to carry it through to the next major announcement – the upcoming iPhone, which is expected early next month. ADVERTISEMENT If everyone who wants an iPhone has an iPhone, what can Apple do to grow its sales? New products that will push people to upgrade is the obvious answer. New markets is the other. Apple has done both, with varying degrees of success. The iPhone SE was intended to tap into the 30 million iPhone users that Apple believed did not want the larger screened iPhone 6s, because they simply prefer a smaller phone. That seems to have paid off for Apple, with SE sales described as strong in the third quarter of the year. Rumours But Apple is still perceived to have an innovation problem. The 3D Touch on its 6s phones has not been as compelling as it would have hoped, and rumours that the company is about to ditch the headphone jack on the iPhone in favour of lightning compatible headphones have not been well received. If Apple follows its previous cycles the next launch should be a new device rather than an upgrade, but the rumours are that the iPhone 7 will be held until next year for the 10-year anniversary. That will leave this year with another evolution of the current handsets. Apple has been pushing hard in China in the hopes of winning over the market. While initial growth was strong, that has fallen off a little. The latest results showed a decline in sales of more than a third. In the second quarter China sales were down 26 per cent. However, chief executive Tim Cook said that the underlying business in China was stronger than the results imply, and he was encouraged about growth. Investor Carl Icahn sold his entire Apple stake this year, citing China as the chief reason. Slowing economic growth and potential government interference that could make doing business more difficult are major worries. Samsung, on the other hand, is still upbeat about its prospects and plans an exclusive Galaxy phone for the China market. But there are some things that should be noted. Apple has now sold a billion iPhones. That’s a milestone for any company. Its profit figures are also more than Samsung’s despite Samsung’s sales figures and market share. If Samsung does manage to capitalise on Apple’s troubles, perhaps it should look closely at how the company is handling the current lull. It may well need to follow a similar path in years to come.       Topics: Carl Icahn Tim Cook Apple Exxon Mobil Google Samsung China Read More Three UK hit by data breach but no risk to Irish customers This week we’re talking about . . . fakebook Get smart with the Science Gallery Podcast Review: Vivofit Jr, an activity tracker for kids Online reviews: what you read isn’t always what you get Research finds way to curb racist tweets Angry Chef debunks ‘clean’ eating movement Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Commercial Property Solicitor entitled to damages in Anglo case Technology Clever cube makes for easier shared viewing English Soccer Ex-England player David White reveals sexual abuse by coach Business Pharmacist taking skincare back to its natural source Sponsored A bank-beating foreign exchange proposition How ‘nudge theory’ can improve pension provision Black Friday: what is it and how to prepare for it Send an AdMailer Christmas card and help a homeless charity ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Commenting on The Irish Times has changed.

By: Tech Desk | Updated: August 11, 2016 12:27 pm Apple MacBook Pro will launch with new processor, thinner design this year, but not at the iPhone event, says a new report. (Source: Reuters) Apple iPhone 7 will launch on September 7, but the company is also planning to refresh its MacBook Pro laptop, which will be first major upgrade since the last four years, says a report in Bloomberg by Mark Gurman, who is known for his accurate Apple scoops. However, the report adds the new MacBook Pro won’t be making an appearance at the iPhone 7 event, although Apple has been testing this laptops for sometime now. The Bloomerg report says Apple’s new MacBook Pro will come with a OLED touchpanel on top, which will replace the function keys. The report says this ‘smaller display’ will present functions as needed, something that was reported earlier by KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo as well. In June, CultofMac had put out pictures which showed the OLED Touch Bar; the pictures were sourced from Apple’s manufacturing partners in China. The report had also claimed the 2016 MacBook Pro series will come with four USB-C type connectors. According to the latest Bloomberg report, Apple will also offer a more powerful processor, possibly an AMD graphics processor, which is also thinner. AMD refused to comment on the report. Design wise, these new MacBook Pros are expected to be slightly thinner than the present models, but not as thin as the MacBook Air or new MacBook. A pressure sensitive touch panel as well as the Touch ID fingerprint scanner is also expected, and Apple has started testing for this as well, adds Bloomberg. Apple’s Macs have seen a decline in sales at a time when the entire PC market faces a tough future. Apple’s iPad has also seen sales decline over the past couple of quarters. In case of the iPhone 6s, the sales have not lived up with Wall Street expectations, and the company saw its first ever decline in revenue this year.

According to rumours, iPhone 7 will ditch the headphone jack, and come with a dual-rear camera setup on the bigger version of the smartphone. However, analysts say iPhone 7 will be a comparatively muted upgrade cycle, and Apple is saving the bigger changes for iPhone 8, which could feature a curved edge OLED display, and totally new glass body design. While iPhone 7 rumours have been flooding the internet for more than a year, MacBook leaks have been muted with the OLED panel one of the more prominent ones. It was also rumoured that Apple could end the MacBook Air line, especially now it has Pro versions of the iPad, which is quite powerful. It will be interesting to see how soon the new MacBook Pro is revealed for the market, and what sort of design changes Apple introduces with these. © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd Express TechIE Samsung Galaxy S7 Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 Gionee S6 Xiaomi Mi 5 Best of Express 26/11 Stories of Strength presented by The Indian Express, Facebook & Instagram IndiaPakistan says three of its soldiers killed in cross border firing; 'response to ceasefire violations,' says Army BusinessHuge surge in Jan Dhan account deposits, Rs 21,000 crore mobilised IndiaNavjot Kaur Sidhu, Pargat Singh will join Congress on Nov 28: Amarinder Singh IndiaDemonetisation logjam: Govt reaches out to Opposition, PM likely to attend RS tomorrow BusinessFormer Tata Steel honcho rebuts Cyrus Mistry charges on Corus buy EntertainmentAlia Bhatt is like Jennifer Lawrence: a star who’s also terrific actor EntertainmentBefikre's song Khulke-Dhulke: Ranveer Singh, Vaani Kapoor and a Bollywood Punjabi wedding, watch video EntertainmentBaahubali 2 leaked scene may have done more good than harm EntertainmentSalman Khan meets his onscreen son Ali Haji after nine years.

(AFP) Apple Inc is threatening to crash Samsung's expensive Olympics party. Samsung is mobile phone sponsor of the Rio Games and sells its handsets exclusively to hundreds of thousands of visitors flocking to Olympic venues - but Apple is tempting some of them outside with its own unofficial Games merchandise. It is using an Apple Store about six miles (10 km) from the main Olympic park as the sole outlet for special-edition Apple watch bands. Some buyers, including top athletes, have been proudly advertising their new bands on social media. The watch bands do not feature the iconic Olympic rings logo or the word "Olympics", which are for the exclusive use of sponsors like Samsung. Instead, they come in a choice of 14 national team colours, including the United States and Canada. A Brazil-themed nylon band was close to selling out this week. "While they don't appear to be breaking any rules, they appear to be getting really close to the edge of ambush or guerilla marketing," said Jeff Benz, who arbitrates disputes for international dispute-resolution firm JAMS and is a former general counsel at the U.S. Olympic Committee. Neither Apple nor Samsung responded to requests for comment on the bands, which are selling for 296 reais ($92.80) each - and only from the U.S. tech giant's store in Barra de Tijuca. Another top Olympics sponsor, Swatch Group's Omega, which makes an Olympic watch and is Games timekeeper, showed no concern. Omega president Raynald Aeschlimann said that unlike his firm, Apple could not talk about its Olympics history. Apple is also not permitted to display its limited-edition bands alongside the Olympics logo, or any other obvious Games symbol, but that has not stopped some Apple fans from doing so. U.S. sprinter Trayvon Bromell has tweeted a photo of himself wearing the USA-themed band of red, white and blue on the same arm as his Olympic rings tattoo. Defending decathlon champion Ashton Eaton has also shared a photo of himself on Twitter wearing the band. Top Olympic sponsors can pay about $100 million over four years to the International Olympic Committee for exclusive marketing rights to the Games, and they keep a close watch for any guerilla marketing during the event by their rivals. So far, Apple is in the clear. "As long as they do not use the Olympic logo, the Rio 2016 logo or our look, there is no infringement," said Sylmara Multini, director of licensing and retail for the Rio 2016 organizing committee. Athletes can also fall foul of Olympic rules if they market a non-official sponsor's products during the Games - but not if they do it well before the event. Bromell shared his photo of the Apple band and his Olympic tattoo on July 21, six days before the blackout period began. Apple is not promoting the new bands directly - many buyers say they are reading about them on blogs - but at least one customer says he regards the band as Olympics merchandising. Nelson Imana, a visiting sports fan from Chicago, bought two bands on the way to watch Olympic volleyball. He said they reminded him of the kind of exclusive merchandise sold at the Masters golf tournament in Augusta, Georgia. "If you see somebody with Masters gear, they'll ask youabout it because you can only buy it there," Imana said. "So if they see this band, they'll say OK, you've probably been to Rio and the Olympics."

The new computers have been in advanced testing within Apple since earlier this year, said one of the people, who didn't want to be identified discussing products before their release. The MacBook Pros aren't likely to debut at an event currently scheduled for September 7 to introduce next-generation versions of the iPhone, according to one of the people. Apple spokesman Bill Evans declined to comment. Apple co-founder Steve Jobs heralded tablets as possible laptop replacements by calling the iPad a "post-PC" device after it launched in 2010, but products like the MacBook Pro have shown surprising resilience. Sales of Macs, including the Pro line, rose 6% to $25.5 billion in the last fiscal year, while iPad sales fell 23% to $23.2 billion. READ ALSOApple's iPhone marketshare falls by 35% in India: ReportThis year's MacBook Pro overhaul is aimed at increasing notebook sales at a time when consumers are taking longer to buy or replace iPads. Apple research suggests customers upgrade iPads roughly every three years, while they buy new iPhones every 18 to 24 months, according to a person familiar with Apple's strategy , which helps explain why iPad sales numbers have fallen from a peak in 2013. Apple will also release a new version of its Mac operating system named Sierra this fall that brings Siri, new messaging and photo-management features, deeper iCloud integration, and more efficient file storage to Apple's desktops and laptops, the company said in June. Apple's shares have begun to recover after tumbling to as low as $90.34 in May amid concerns of slowing iPhone sales. They are up 3.4% now for the year to $108.81.

I explored some of the issues myself last year in: “What Would Happen if a Future Apple Autonomous Car Made a Very Bad Decision?” There I addressed, to first order, some of the liability and political issues. Going forward, the specific details of a moral decision about life and death decisions presents a difficult problem that involves quantifying then instantiating into software logic for these important decisions. It would be nice for society to have more time to ponder, but the pace of technology leaves us precious little time for that. In what follows, I’ll look at the research then toy with a variation of Asimov’s Three Laws of Robotics in order to pose the Big Question. First off, I should emphasize that this is a subject that is being scrutinized more and more. Research is being done, thousands of automotive engineers at the major car companies plus Google, Tesla, and likely Apple are working on the problem. And it’s fascinating. Other entities are looking into the morality issues surrounding autonomous vehicles. I would think that state and federal government, the insurance companies, and the U.S. Society of Automotive Engineers are pondering the issues. And so some fanciful notions that I present later are simply to get more discussion going. Here are some current, candidate mechanism for developing autonomous vehicle morality. 1. Prescribed Morality There are several ways to attack this problem. One, perhaps the most traditional and obvious way, is to create a set of man-made rules. The problem with that is that different people have a different point of view, and there may be reasons to believe there is no practical resolution that fits all. In 1942, the distinguished scientist, a Ph.D. in biochemistry and science fiction writer, Dr. Isaac Asimov ginned up the Three Laws of Robotics. My perception has been that the original motivation was to simply support his sci-fi writing. Later, the real prospect of actual robots in this century has cast his laws from the realm of fiction to serious conversation for 21st century robot developers. Alas, that was 3/4 century ago, and we have new tools at our disposal as well as new ways of handling technical issues. What seemed simple and decisive then may not apply today. Also, deference to the wisdom of a few experts is not as popular nowadays, and yet there may still be valuable insights to harvest. 2. Crowd Sourcing One of the ways modern researchers are attacking this issue is to conduct situational experiments with a large number of people in order to understand, in a statistically valid way, the most prevalent moral values of human drivers. That can product interesting results. For example, in this article at Scientific American: “Driverless Cars Will Face Moral Dilemmas,” the following result was cited. Most of the 1,928 research participants in the Science report indicated that they believed vehicles should be programmed to crash into something rather than run over pedestrians, even if that meant killing the vehicle’s passengers. Yet many of the same study participants balked at the idea of buying such a vehicle, preferring to ride in a driverless car that prioritizes their own safety above that of pedestrians. Humans don’t always crystalize their values in consistent ways. More on that later. Along that line, an article at the MIT Technology Review is entitled “Why Self-Driving Cars Must Be Programmed to Kill.” That seems callous, but it’s an emerging fact. The question is, “Who and under what circumstances?” 3. Morality Engines A third related avenue is to build AI agents that are able to, by exposure to a great number of test case human scenarios, learn to build an ethical foundation and then exercise it. See: “When should driverless cars kill their own passengers?” To quote: The Machine is comprised of a series of ethical dilemmas, most of them making me feel uneasy when answering them. For example, what do you do when a driverless car without passengers either has to drive into a stoplight-flaunting dog or an abiding criminal? One of the virtues (or drawbacks, depending on one’s point of view) of a morality engine is that the decisions an autonomous vehicle makes can only be traced back only to software. That helps to absolve a car maker’s employees from direct liability when it comes life and death decisions by machine. That certainly seems to be an emerging trend in technology. The benefit is obvious. If a morality engine makes the right decision, by human standards, 99,995 times out of 100,000, the case for extreme damages due to systematic failure causing death is weak. Technology and society can move forward. Very likely, the evolution of autonomous car morality will be a mixture of methods #2 and #3 above. It’s a technique that both reflects the values of people polled and instantiates that morality into an AI agent that does the best possible job. Even so, I am going to go out on a limb, for the sake of exploration and discussion, and propose a starting point for method #1. I’m doing this because the best way to start a discussion is to built a straw man.

Can’t see the trucking industry getting on board with this due to union issues as well as insurance and safety issues for another 10 to 15 years at least. Not sure how you came up with a 5 year time plan. Way too ambitious of a time plan. August 10, 2016 at 6:46 EST PM nehawalia August 11, 2016 Good Topic……. August 11, 2016 at 4:42 EST AM Jamie August 11, 2016 I don’t know how many times this needs to be said, but I guess it bears repeating because engineers seem to either keep forgetting or fail to grasp the concept all together: morality is derivative of human compassion and it is not a faculty of logic. AI will never be in possession of ‘morality’, just its facsimile. *Anything* that it does will be the result of programming by us, at least at the root level, autonomy is a misnomer (something the silicon valley hype train excels at). So the answer to this question is a resounding no. By its very nature (which is math-based and therefore logic based) software will never be capable of ‘morality’, only what we tell it morality is (and yes, human beings are capable of spontaneous compassion in spite of their ‘programming’, software never will be capable of spontinaety, period). Look no further than collateral damage from drone strikes for evidence, and those are by and large still mostly human controlled. It’s science fiction, folks, and it would be the epitome of stupid to think otherwise. August 11, 2016 at 9:17 EST AM Lee Dronick August 11, 2016 Spot on Jamie! August 11, 2016 at 9:39 EST AM gnasher729 August 11, 2016 Your’e looking at the problem from the complete wrong angle. There is no matter of morality here. There are some people _talking_ very loudly about moral problems, and for some reason they get a lot of attention, but looking at the problem this way is wrong. The first law and only law of a self driving car is: Avoid hitting things. That’s it. To implement the first law of driving, the self driving car isn’t allowed to drink and drive, and it’s not allowed to drive blindly, and it isn’t allowed to go into tricky situations at high speed. You may say that hitting a lamp post and hitting a child are different things, but as long as you avoid hitting them you are fine and no distinction is needed. Now collisions will not be totally avoidable, because the self driving car is surrounded by idiots. Every driver knows the feeling 🙂 By driving carefully, the self driving car will avoid situations where it causes damage. It may react better in situations where a human driver just thinks “oh shit oh shit oh shit what am I doing now” – I’ve had situations like that, and I suppose a self driving car would know at all times what’s left, right and behind and would often be able to take evasive action that I couldn’t. Now accepting that collisions are not totally avoidable, we can add a rule: “When hitting things, minimise the damage. Damage is calculated from speed, whether the thing looks human, and whether the thing looks big and hard”. If done right, a self driving car will never get into a situation where “morality” would come into play. If it does: The highway code (or whatever it’s called in the USA) doesn’t mention morality. The rules that I learned: Don’t hit people. Don’t put people into danger. Watch out for elderly people and children. That’s all humans need to know, no morals needed. That’s all that a self driving car is needed. August 11, 2016 at 10:04 EST AM daemon August 11, 2016 Morally speaking, the only moral death is the one you choose for yourself that saves the lives of those with you. Machines aren’t alive and thus cannot make a moral choice of death. All machine choices that end in death are by definition immoral. August 11, 2016 at 12:55 EST PM John Creamer August 11, 2016 I keep seeing articles positing moral choices for automated vehicles, but they miss the point. We would no more program a vehicle to make such choices than we would teach drivers to. We don’t tell teenagers in Driver’s Ed to hit one pedestrian in order to avoid a group of three. We teach teenagers to drive responsibly in order to avoid such dilemmas. Automated systems need to be (and in practice are) designed to operate within safe boundaries or not to operate at all. The whole challenge is in determining the conditions under which the system can function safely. Tesla’s mistake was in designing a system that requires human supervision without designing into the system a mechanism to ensure that the driver was always paying attention. This is why we have regulations that set minimum performance requirements for safety. August 11, 2016 at 1:08 EST PM bleddy August 11, 2016 @gnasher729: I agree with your like of thinking. Much is said of the “morality” of the machines and worry that it will be less than that of a human driver. We all see (nearly everyday) human drivers operate their current machines in arguably immoral ways. Speeding, sudden lane changes, ad nausium. The vast majority of us really try to do the best we can when driving but as humans, when faced with the time constrained choice of “who do I hit?” are unlikely to make a substatially better choice than a machine following yours or some other set of rules. I quibble with the order of your set of rules, however. (This is where we get into societal norms) I would move rule 1 to position 2 or even 3. The passengers are responsible for choosing to go by way of car (autonomous or otherwise ). I think they bear the primary responsibility for initiating the journey and should bear the greater risk.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Thursday, 11 August 2016 | MYT 9:00 AM Fitness bands and smartwatches: Where are they now? by jennifer van grove Limited use?: Marlbrough wears his Apple watch to keep track of appointments. — San Diego Union-Tribune/TNS SAN DIEGO: A seemingly simple quest to find a way to track jogs without lugging around an iPhone morphed into a complex realisation.  For years now, wearables have been touted as the next big thing in tech, yet even the trend-defining Apple has struggled to produce a device that resonates with the masses.  This industry, with all the promise in the world to make us healthier, more informed human beings, still seems to be nothing more than a sleepy tech segment, one that certainly hasn't lived up to its initial hype.  After all, the runaway leader in the category, Fitbit, sold a modest 4.8 million connected devices during the first three months of the year. The company's stock has been on the struggle bus this year, and Fitbit's market capitalisation is well shy of its value after its initial public offering last June.  "We are after square one," Ramon Llamas said of the wearables space. Llamas is the wearables research manager at International Data Corp. "But we're still in the initial stages."  The firm estimates that vendors shipped nearly 20 million wearables in the first quarter of 2016. Though that's a 67% increase over a year ago, it is a meagre number compared with the more than 334 million smartphones vendors shipped during the same period.  The comparison is, of course, unfair. In this day and age, almost everyone requires a smartphone – if only to participate in the Pokémon Go craze. On the other hand, no one truly needs a smartwatch or fitness band, especially since many of us long ago ditched our more traditional wristwatches. And phones do an acceptable job of counting steps.  Still, there seems to be a gradual, growing acceptance of at least the most basic of fitness trackers. Though they have a singular purpose, to track your fitness, and they offer the same features on day 100 as they do on day one, they are approachable to regular folks.  "Fitness trackers are more popular than smartwatches," said Llamas. "They are things that people really get. You can wrap your brain around how many steps you've taken, how many calories you've burned. And the price point is reasonable to most. ... Whereas with a smartwatch, people sometimes don't get it."  Apple shipped 55% fewer watches in the second quarter than it did a year ago, according to the firm. The electronics retailer was also the only smartphone vendor among the top five to experience an annual decline in shipments.  Still, with 47% market share, Apple is the leader in the smartwatch sector. And some people really swear by their Apple Watches.  Take Rob Marlbrough, a 45-year-old and self-described early adopter, who purchased his Apple Watch Sport soon after it was released in April 2015. He continues to wear it everyday, albeit with an upgraded Milanese Loop band. He likes the watch's basic features, primarily the calendar function, which reminds him of his upcoming meetings.  "It's nice not to pull my phone out every couple of minutes," he added. "I turned off all the annoying stuff, Instagram notifications and Facebook notifications, because it was just too buzzy all the time."  On the other hand, there is another category of first-movers, often techies, who really wanted to want wearables. They were first to embrace what's sometimes also called the quantified self movement, attaching bands to their wrists to optimize daily routines. But, for one reason or another, many have since stashed their bands and watches in drawers, never again to see the light of day.  "I got one of the very first Fitbits. I used it obsessively," said Samir Bhavnani, 39. "But I took it off one day. I went to charge it. Two weeks later, it still was sitting there on the charger."  That was a year and a half ago. In the interim, he tried the Apple Watch Sport, which was an anniversary present from his wife. It ultimately ended up on her wrist instead.  "I didn't like that I needed to charge another thing," Bhavnani said. "There was not one compelling feature that made it worth that nightly charge."  Erica O'Grady, 37, of Boulder, Colorado, similarly gave up on her Jawbone Up, a fitness and sleep tracker with an accompanying mobile app that debuted at the end of 2011. O'Grady got her first Up in 2012 and loved the sleep-tracking features and the app, but ended up going through five devices over a seven-month period and gave up.  She has since considered trying a Fitbit and turned down a free Garmin band. She doesn't want to have to deal with the hassle of replacing malfunctioning gadgets.  "It got really frustrating," she said of her Jawbone Up return-and-exchange experience. "If the hardware worked as well as the apps work, I'd be all in."  In theory, O'Grady may not have to wait too much longer for more impressive hardware.  "By the time we reach 2020, we will look back at devices we have today and say to ourselves, 'My, my, my, they were state of the art, but by today's standards, they are rather quaint,'" IDC's Llamas said.  Quaint and maybe just a little bit silly. Bhavnani's two six-year-olds wear the Misfit Flash, a US$30 (RM119) waterproof band that tracks steps and calories but doesn't need to be charged. The young girl and boy now treat exercise like a game. They run around the park, with one of their parent's iPhones in tow, playing Pokémon Go in the hopes of reaching their daily activity goal.  Perhaps, then, we shouldn't rule out Pokémon Go's potential to raise the profile of fitness trackers and other wearables. Apparently, Jawbone Up wearers who played the augmented reality smartphone game over the weekend of July 9 logged 62.5 more steps on average than the prior weekend.  After all, if you're going to spend your life chasing fictional characters, you might as well have data to prove you did something worthwhile with your time. — The San Diego Union-Tribune/Tribune News Service You May Be Interested Israeli firm can steal phone data in seconds Yew Sin-Ee Yi continue fine run in Hong Kong Pokémon Go: Dittos are hiding in plain sight Fraud in Felda Global Ventures Rejuvenate yourself with American ginseng Apple issues recall on September, October 2015 iPhone 6S Others Also Read Former international to speak at football symposium M’sia, Thailand to begin talks on Bangkok-KL HSR project - Thai Minister Japan enlists Sailor Moon to promote safe sex advertisement Latest News Philippines money laundering body charges bankers for ignoring cyberheist Google nears tax settlement with Indonesian government: sources The new Vivo V5 takes the selfie crown Self-driving car group urges US regulators to clear road Singapore unveils self-driving scooter, ideal for phone-obsessed walkers Most Viewed in Tech Apple issues recall on September, October 2015 iPhone 6S Viral video will crash your iPhone The new Vivo V5 takes the selfie crown Pokémon Go: Dittos are hiding in plain sight Google nears tax settlement with Indonesian government: sources Self-driving car group urges US regulators to clear road Israeli firm can steal phone data in seconds Singapore unveils self-driving scooter, ideal for phone-obsessed walkers Pokémon Go says thanks and reshuffles CP Watch your self-ie!

Share Tweet Share Tags : Motorola-Motorola+ Samsung-Samsung+ Windows-Windows+ iOS-iOS+ LG-LG+ Apple-Apple+ Android-Android+ Huawei-Huawei+ Xiaomi-Xiaomi+ Kantar WorldPanel released its second quarter market share report today, and it showed that in the U.S. iOS rose 1.3 percentage points. That means that the Apple iPhone was responsible for 31.8% of smartphone sales in the country from April through June. Apple had the top selling device in the U.S. during that period as the Apple iPhone 6s and Apple iPhone 6s Plus combined to snag 15.1% of U.S. smartphone sales. Not far behind was the Samsung Galaxy S7 and Samsung Galaxy S7 edge with a combined 14.1% share. The Apple iPhone SE was third with 5.1%. The new 4-inch handset helped iOS rack up the numbers it did during the quarter. Android's share in the U.S. dropped by less than a percentage points to 66.5%, remaining on top by a comfortable margin. Windows continued its long descent toward oblivion as its share nearly dropped in half from 3% last year to this year's 1.6%. In the U.S., Samsung remained on top with 35% of the smartphone market. Apple was next with 32%, followed by the 14% slice of the pie owned by LG. Motorola was next with 5%. The figures mean that LG has doubled its position in the U.S. market over the last two years. Motorola has seen its share slump by 50% from the 10% it snagged last quarter. 38% of current Motorola owners plan on switching brands in the next year. While 58% are loyal to the brand, that is well behind the 92% loyalty rate earned by Apple and the 85% owned by Samsung. In China, iOS lost 1.8pp in the quarter and now has a market share of 17.9%. Android gained 2.1 percentage points to 81.4% While the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus are on top of the sales charts in the country, the Huawei Mate 8, Huawei P9, Xiaomi Redmi Note 3, Xiaomi Mi 5 and Oppo R9 are squeezing Apple's sales. The Apple iPhone SE had only 2.5% of Chinese smartphone sales in the quarter. That was the opposite of what took place in Great Britain in the second quarter. The iPhone SE had a leading 9.2% share followed by the 9.1% garnered by the iPhone 6s. Overall, in the country iOS rose 3.1pp to 37.2%.

Market share will fluctuate time to time due to gimmicks by cheap OEMs. Curved screens for mere looks, waterproofing partially, wireless slow charging etc.. Those will never prevail when people realize they don't get much out of those much but they get stuck in cheap android mud in the name of those gimmicks. I use a S7. I used to have an iPhone 5. So I see this everyday. I don't use any of those fancy useless gimmicks ever. I find them boring. Only upside is having better low light camera quality due to a larger sensor. That's not so ground breaking by any mean for me. posted on 11 Aug 2016, 04:17 0 Reply 24.

Particularly the logo at the back and the button on the front. Its so simple, Stylish, Luxury and grand. All other phones are trying to catch up with iPhone design and I know nobody would agree with me and I would be bashed for this. But this is my personal opinion. Apple is the most respected company because their products speak. Good job Apple. No matter its .6 or .1. Lead is lead. Awesome job apple once again and you deserve this. posted on 11 Aug 2016, 05:48 0 Reply 28. ColinW (Posts: 148; Member since: 04 Jun 2014) Their products are very much mediocre, this is why their sales and market share is falling. The iPhones design is falling way behind too, not leading. Others pack in much more into more compact, lighter and better looking bodies. The looks may be an opinion, but the rest is fact. posted on 11 Aug 2016, 15:34 0 Reply 30. cdgoin (Posts: 538; Member since: 28 Jul 2010) Im a Windows Phone Fan and even I saw this coming but not even I thought it was going to be this big of a change.

The updated notebooks will be thinner, include a touch screen strip for function keys, and will be offered with more powerful and efficient graphics processors for expert users such as video gamers. The new computers have been in advanced testing within Apple since earlier this year. The MacBook Pros aren’t likely to debut at an event currently scheduled for September 7 to introduce next-generation versions of the iPhone. Apple co-founder Steve Jobs heralded tablets as possible laptop replacements by calling the iPad a “post-PC” device after it launched in 2010, but products like the MacBook Pro have shown surprising resilience. Sales of Macs, including the Pro line, rose 6% to $25.5bn (€23bn) in the last fiscal year, while iPad sales fell 23% to $23.2bn. This year’s MacBook Pro overhaul is aimed at increasing notebook sales at a time when consumers are taking longer to buy or replace iPads. Apple research suggests customers upgrade iPads roughly every three years, while they buy new iPhones every 18 to 24 months, which helps explain why iPad sales numbers have fallen. The most significant addition to the new MacBook Pro is a secondary display above the keyboard that replaces the standard function key row. Instead of physical keys, a strip-like screen will present functions on an as-needed basis that fit the current task or application. The smaller display will use Organic Light-Emitting Diodes, a thinner screen technology, KGI Securities said earlier this year.

Benchmark Awards Reports Blogs Topics CXO Challenge Whitepapers What's On Apple hits back at banks' Apple Pay NFC push By Allie Coyne on Aug 11, 2016 10:53AM Claims underdog status. Apple has lashed out at Australia's banks, claiming their attempt to pressure the technology giant to open up NFC technology on its iPhones threatens to compromise the security of devices and reduce innovation. Late last month three of Australia's big four banks alongside Bendigo Bank lobbied the ACCC to let them form a cartel for the next three years so they can strong-arm Apple into providing third-party access to the near-field communications (NFC) chips on its devices. The banks said they are currently able to offer Android-based mobile payments services, but are locked out from doing the same thing on iOS. They claim Apple is using its "significant bargaining power" to limit customer choice and competition in the market by only offering its own Apple Pay payments platform on its devices. But in its response to the call, Apple last week told the ACCC that approving the banks' request would set a "troubling precedent and delay the introduction of new, potentially disruptive technologies".  It also claimed allowing third-party access to the NFC chip would compromise the security of the device. "Apple upholds very high security standards for our customers when they use Apple devices to make payments," it wrote. "Providing simple access to the NFC antenna by banking applications would fundamentally diminish the high level of security Apple aims to have on our devices." Apple argued Apple Pay was not a competitive threat to the banks, who the tech giant accused of wanting to "maintain complete control of their customers".  "The applicants represent the majority of cards issues to consumers and they collectively have the power to dictate the future of mobile payments," it wrote. "The request ... would slow innovation and reduce choices by protecting members of the cartel from each other for the next three years.  "The banks would have little incentive to compete amongst themselves to develop the best and most innovative payments services for their customers." Apple claimed it needed the big four banks to be on board with Apple Pay - given their market share - for the payments platform to succeed locally. It said it had "struggled" to negotiate with Australia's banks - excluding ANZ Bank, which signed up to Apple Pay in April - claiming one had even refused to sign a confidentiality agreement for preliminary discussions. It urged the ACCC to reject the request so as to avoid harming consumers and competition. The ACCC is taking submissions on the proposal until August 18. Copyright © iTnews.com.au .

Sensor Tower, an app intelligence firm, is predicting that by 2020, the Apple App Store will boast over 5 million apps, more than doubling its size in just four years. The App Store, which launched in 2008 with five thousand apps, now has more than two million different apps. There’s something for everyone: dating apps, weather apps, and even an app to help prevent shark attacks. But games are the bread and butter of the App Store. Because most games have a short shelf life, developers have to constantly create new games to maintain interest. Of the apps added to the store in 2016, 43 percent were games. Related: Apple’s next wearable might be able to monitor your blood sugar level The challenge that users run into with so many choices is how to find the right app for their needs. Apple is allowing developers to purchase ads in the search results. This is a great way for new apps and developers to get exposure. It’s even more important because more than half of the apps downloaded are found from the search results. Apple is also redesigning the way the App Store homepage looks. Instead of presenting users with a bunch of apps that they have already downloaded, they will only see new apps. The Categories section will be coming back to better help people find what they need. Despite the addition of all these new apps, users still only use a few applications regularly. Based on Sensor Tower’s analysis, users download 1.5 applications on average per month. The most popular applications that are accessed on a daily basis include many of the apps that come preloaded on your device. This means that smaller developers are competing heavily with big-time apps that have the advantage of not requiring downloading.

Reports: MacBook Pro Is Getting a Makeover By Richard Adhikari Aug 10, 2016 3:54 PM PT The long wait for a MacBook Pro refresh appears to be nearing an end, if the latest rumors are correct. The new MacBook Pros expected to launch this fall will feature a Touch ID power button and a touch-sensitive OLED strip that will replace the physical function keys on the keyboard, both 9to5 Mac and Bloomberg reported this week. The strip reportedly will bring up functions appropriate to the application that's in use. For example, it may display media playback controls when a user opens iTunes. It also might display editing commands, such as cut and paste, when a word processing program is running. The strip may allow Apple to add new buttons through software updates rather than hardware refreshes. Innovation Mandate "If you're a new user or a younger or more flexible and adaptable person, you'd think [the strip's] great," said Laura DiDio, principal analyst at ITIC. "Media playback controls when iTunes is open... editing commands during word processing... I can see kids catching fire with this," she told TechNewsWorld. However, "there's still that not-so-silent contingent of traditionalists out there who want to remain with the status quo," DiDio cautioned. Still, "you have to constantly reinvent yourself as a vendor," she said. The new MacBook Pros will be slightly thinner than current models, and have a smaller footprint, according to Bloomberg's report. The thinner form factor is generating interest, DiDio said. "You might see some people bringing the new MacBook Pros with them on the road." The possibility that Apple will bring Touch ID fingerprint technology to the MacBook Pro line also would be well received, she suggested. The new MacBook Pros will use one of AMD's "Polaris graphics cards, which are more than 20 percent thinner than predecessors, and will include USB C ports, according to Bloomberg. That is significant, DiDio said, and "it's good for AMD." Time Is Right Apple last refreshed the MacBook Pro in December 2013. "I think the MacBook lineup in general is due for a major refresh," remarked Linn Huang, a research director at IDC. "That's not to say that the products are bad in any way, shape or form," he told TechNewsWorld. "Apple's still a leader in design and, of course, [OS X] keeps their lineup insulated from the rest of the PC market," Huang noted. "However, Apple cannot afford to have their lineup get stale, given that the other PC OEMs are rapidly closing the gap, if not outright exceeding Apple in design leadership." Dell and HP both have launched "fantastically designed ultra-slim notebooks in the last couple of years," he pointed out, "and, of course, there's much exciting innovation occurring between the lines as tablets and PC form factors emerge." One idea that has gained some traction is that Apple is refreshing the MacBook Pro line to offset falling iPad sales. "I'm not sure that's Apple's intention, given that the two categories exist in different stratospheres," Huang said. "The new iPad Pro line is Apple's intended shot at reinvigorating iPad refreshes," he remarked. "I just think the MacBook look and feel hasn't evolved much as of late, and is due for a major update." Apple's Overall Strategy The MacBook Pro refresh -- assuming the reports are accurate -- would suggest "we're into the Tim Cook years, driven by pragmatic business decisions rather than the flash and genius that we came to know from Steve Jobs," suggested ITIC's DiDio. "Even Steve Jobs couldn't be Steve Jobs every quarter and come out with the next big thing." Apple "had a run of eight quarters of consecutive strong year-over-year growth of its MacBook lineup starting in Q4 2013," Huang pointed out. "After an underwhelming Q4 2015 holiday and what will now be two disastrous quarters to open 2016, perhaps Apple feels the pressure to make that update now."

Malik didn’t mince words when it came to discussing Apple’s perceived lack of focus, its Hollywood connections, and entertainment aspirations. “You were asking me what is the problem with Apple? Not the lightning port — this kind of stupidity of building a TV show around apps. It’s like, what? Somebody needs to make friends in Hollywood and so we should do a show like this? This is just such nonsense. They should be building better products and not stupid TV shows around those products. Back in mid-July, Apple issued an open casting call for its reality TV show Planet of the Apps. The show, which has been rumored to be in the works since earlier this year, will feature Hollywood actress Gwyneth Paltrow, who will serve as a mentor to contestants. Musician will.i.am will work in an advisor role, as will Gary Vaynerchuk, better known as Gary V. Although Apple’s Senior Vice President of Internet Software and Services, Eddy Cue, has stated that the company has no interest in creating additional original television shows, Apple did recently acquire the viral Late Late Show segment ‘Carpool Karaoke’. Malik, however, thinks that Apple could do a better job of acquiring entertainment properties: “They want to do entertainment content? Buy damn Netflix and move on from there. Do it properly if you want to do it. Don’t try and do this stupid penny ante stuff which adds no value to the company, absolutely none.” Listen to Om Malik talk about Apple beginning at 31:05 In a recent interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Cue stated that Apple is interested in boosting Apple Music, not competing with Netflix: “We are only going into the content business [with projects] that we think are really tied to our products. Right now, that’s Apple Music.” In the meantime, Apple’s Mac lineup has languished as customers await new hardware. With the exception of the 12″ MacBook and the iMac, Apple’s computers haven’t seen significant updates in well over a year, with the Mac Pro going on three years without an update since the “Can’t innovate anymore my ass” launch. This trend hasn’t gone unnoticed by many Apple reporters, including Malik: “If you want to do something for the shareholders make interesting damn MacBooks, which people can buy. You want to do something nice? Make a better phone, which people want to keep buying. Nobody cares if you do Planet of the Apps.” Eddy Cue at Oracle Arena Om had even stronger words for Eddy Cue: “You look at Eddy Cue; the guy was hanging out at the playoffs when iCloud was burning for 6 hours. You know, he wouldn’t have survived a day if Steve was around. I’m sorry, that’s what gets me worked up about this company…they have all these wrong priorities.” For the record, Eddy Cue has been with Apple since 1989, and was there prior to Jobs’ return to the company. Eddy worked a long time under Steve’s watch, and played key roles in the creation of Apple’s online store, the iTunes Store, and the App Store. Back in December of 2015, Cue’s duties of overseeing App Store and iBooks Store leadership were handed off to Apple’s SVP of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, amid developer discontent. Despite this executive move, Cue retains many responsibilities. He still oversees the iTunes Store and Apple Music, as well as Apple Pay, Siri, Maps, iCloud, and Apple’s in-house productivity apps. Industry critics have always existed, but this strikes me as the harshest public criticism of the post-Steve Jobs Apple that we’ve seen thus far. This isn’t some random commentator with an opinion on Apple’s current state. This is a well-respected industry veteran who’s been writing about Apple and the rest of the industry for many years. For what it’s worth, Apple is planning a substantial update to the MacBook Pro, which is rumored to include a Touch ID power button, an OLED touch-panel, a bigger trackpad, and a smaller, thinner footprint, among other likely changes. That’s not all that the GigaOM founder had to say about Apple. Says Malik, speaking of Apple’s entertainment aspirations, “All those things are nice, but in the end, they just need to build systems of tomorrow, not keep doing things of today.” Apple is obviously not pulling engineering resources off of projects to push forward its entertainment initiatives, but the argument can be made that it sets the wrong tone when considering the current state of the Mac lineup. What do you think? Is Apple spreading itself too thin by pursuing these entertainment ventures, or is it much ado about nothing? Be sure to watch the full video, as Leo Leporte, Om Malik, Philip Elmer-DeWitt, and David Coursey chime in during the discussion.

_ Macworld Australia MAC iPad iPhone iSnap App Guide Gadget Guide mResell HOME NEWS FEATURES REVIEWS HELP/TIPS BLOGS Mac In Business Communications Productivity Security Workflow FORUM MAGAZINE Digital Subscription Current Issue Back Issues New MacBook Pros are reportedly on deck, but not in September Caitlin McGarry 11 August, 2016 View more articles fromthe author AAA Comments News Everyone knows the MacBook Pro has languished. Apple has focused less on its portable option for power users in recent years and more on iPads, of which there are now two Pro models. But many, many people still rely on the MacBook Pro to get work done and after, more than four years without a major overhaul, Apple is reportedly gearing up to surprise us all with a huge upgrade. We’ve heard this before. Back in May, rumours swirled that Apple was slimming down the 13in and 15in Pro models while also planning to add a touchscreen panel to the keyboard. That panel would replace the current strip of physical function keys and make the MacBook more responsive and interactive, since the function keys could change depending on the app you’re using. A new Bloomberg report reaffirms the previously reported rumours, and notes that buyers will have the option to upgrade their preferred model with AMD’s Polaris graphics chip for more powerful gaming and other graphics-intensive use cases. Here’s what else you can expect from the new MacBook Pros: Touch ID USB-C Pressure-sensitive trackpad New colours, such as gold According to Bloomberg, the new MacBook Pros won’t appear on stage at Apple’s September iPhone 7 launch event, where new phones and perhaps a second-gen Apple Watch are expected to debut. Previous reported pegged the Pro launch to a spring event, so that’s still a possibility – just not September. Mac sales are down 11 percent year-over-year, Apple reported in its third-quarter earnings last month, so the company is likely expecting a big Pro refresh to turn those numbers around.

In a note on its website, the company said that as of the start of the 2016 school year, there are 32,145 students at underserved public schools in the US that are learning on iPad through the program. As the 2016-2017 school year kicks off, there are now 32,145 students at underserved public schools across the country who are learning, creating and exploring on iPad through Apple’s ConnectED commitment.  Today, 701 students in Indianola, Mississippi, were introduced to iPad as Carver Elementary School became the 66th ConnectED school — and the first of the school year — to transform its classrooms with Apple’s cutting edge teaching and learning technology solutions. In addition to the 32,000+ student iPads, Apple has also donated over 9,000 iPads and Macs to teachers, and provided schools with professional learning, wireless infrastructure and other support. Apple has pledged $100 million to ConnectED, an initiative announced by President Obama in 2014.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides finally embrace iPad split-view Chris Davies - Aug 10, 2016 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Google’s Office apps have finally – finally – embraced iOS 9’s split-view support, ending one of the most confusing feature hold-outs ever to plague Apple’s mobile platform. Split-screen multitasking was one of the most-anticipated aspects of iOS 9, addressing in one fell swoop criticisms that the platform was unsuitable to properly replace a laptop or Windows tablet that had plagued it since the first iPad. However, while Apple’s native apps for iPad were updated along with iOS 9 to support the feature, it was left up to individual developers to code support into their own software. That has taken Google longer than expected. In fact, Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides, the company’s word processor, spreadsheet, and presentation apps, were arguably the most obvious candidates for split-screen support, making the company’s tardiness to update them even more confusing. Good things do apparently come to those who wait, though, and today updates pushed out to Docs, Sheets, and Slides bring with them, among other things, the oft-requested feature. It works just as you’d expect. Swiping in from the side of the screen while you’re using Google Docs pulls in a sidebar which can be used to view a second app; dragging that divide further across splits the screen into two. When holding the iPad in portrait orientation you have a single split option, 60/40, while in landscape you get a choice of two, both 70/30 and 50/50. Unfortunately you can’t have two instances of the same app visible at the same time, though, which means there’s no way to see two Google Docs documents simultaneously and flick between them. NOW READ: Making the iPad Pro 9.7 work for work Still, even with that limit in place, this is a long-anticipated improvement. Rival word processing apps, like Microsoft’s Word and Apple’s own Pages, have ticked that box some time ago, but many people are heavily wedded to Google’s services and couldn’t justify – or stomach – switching platforms. You can find the new Google Docs, Google Sheets, and Google Slides versions in the App Store, where they’re free downloads. In addition to split-view, the new Google Docs supports inserting images and page breaks; like Google Sheets and Slides, it also has a number of bugfixes.

The company today announced that its ConnectED efforts have helped the company reach more than 32,000 students throughout the United States. Most recently, Carver Elementary School in Indianola, Mississippi joined the ConnectED program, becoming the 66th school to which Apple has provided iPads. For those unfamiliar, ConnectED is a program started by the Obama Administration to provide cutting-edge technology to teachers and students. In 2014, Apple pledged $100 million in iPads, computers, and other technology to the education program. Currently, Apple is providing some form of aid to 114 schools. Apple today says that it has delivered iPads to 32,145 students as part of its ConnectED efforts, as well as to 9,042 teachers. Additionally, 4,434 hours of “Apple Professional Learning” have been taught by Apple representatives at the schools, while 189 miles of internet cable has been installed. As the 2016-2017 school year kicks off, there are now 32,145 students at underserved public schools across the country who are learning, creating and exploring on iPad through Apple’s ConnectED commitment. Today, 701 students in Indianola, Mississippi, were introduced to iPad as Carver Elementary School became the 66th ConnectED school — and the first of the school year — to transform its classrooms with Apple’s cutting edge teaching and learning technology solutions. In addition to providing an iPad to every student and teacher, Apple’s ConnectED grant also includes professional learning, wireless infrastructure upgrades and ongoing support. The ultimate goal of Obama’s ConnectED is to connect 99 percent of students in America to high-speed internet service within 5 years of 2014. In addition to Apple’s contributions, Verizon and Microsoft have also aided in the efforts, as has Sprint and a variety of other companies Apple gave a brief update on its ConnectED efforts in late 2014, noting that it was working with Pearson, Scholastic, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, Lexia, and other educational content partners to provide schools with up-to-date learning information. It’s important to note that Apple has efforts outside of ConnectED when it comes to education, selling Macs and iPads to a variety of schools around the world. You can read more Apple’s ConnectED efforts on its website, while the White House website also provides details on the reach of the initiative.

Priced from $399, the iPhone SE crams in the brainpower from the iPhone 6s (Apple A9 processor, M9 motion processor) into the body of the iPhone 5s. Given that the iPhone 6s starts at $649, the iPhone SE represents a pretty good bargain if you’re firmly entrenched in iOS land. The latest research from Kantar confirms the iPhone SE’s popularity, at least in two regions around the globe: Europe and the United States. During the second quarter of 2016 in Great Britain, the iPhone SE managed to grab the first-place spot in smartphone sales with a 9.2 percent share (just ahead of the iPhone 6s with 9.1 percent). Brisk iPhone SE sales helped iOS grow its share of the mobile OS market by 3.1 percent (to a total of 37.2 percent) in Great Britain. Apple saw gains in France, where its share of the smartphone market rose to 21 percent. Apple also saw an increase in iPhone sales for the first time in nearly a year in Germany, taking its share to 14.2 percent. Overall, Apple’s overall smartphone share in the EU5 (Great Britain, Germany, France, Italy, Spain) rose 0.7 percent during the second quarter to 18.2 percent. The iPhone SE was the third best-selling smartphone in the United States with a 5.1 percent share behind the first place iPhone 6s/iPhone 6s Plus (15.1 percent) and second place Samsung Galaxy S7/Galaxy S7 Edge (14.1 percent). The iPhone SE’s lower price point allowed it to gobble up nearly 23 percent of all iPhone sales. However, that lower price point also led to a lower average selling price (ASP) for iPhones. The ASP for iPhones was nearly $700 six months ago. But in Apple’s most recently completed quarter, the ASP fell to just $595, which is an incredibly steep decline for the company. It should also be noted that the iPhone SE hasn’t been a success everywhere. The smartphone was only able to capture 2.5 percent of the critical Chinese market, where Apple is facing tremendous pressure from homegrown OEMs that continually spit out higher-spec’d smartphone for less money. And the 4-inch form-factor isn’t exactly a hot seller in the region. “With strong demand for the iPhone SE throughout the second quarter, it will be interesting to track whether iOS growth will continue through the third quarter, assuming that supplies become less constrained,” writes Kantar analyst Lauren Guenveur. “Anticipation for the newest iPhone, usually released in late September every year, typically means a weaker summer period for iOS.” Speaking of the next flagship smartphone from Apple, the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are expected to debut next month with A10 processors, 3GB of RAM (on the Plus model), a touch sensitive home button and dual cameras (again, only on the Plus model).

But game developers have taken advantage of the device’s ability to run third-party apps, and a decent number of games have been produced for Apple’s home-media box. I received a new Apple TV as a Christmas gift last year. The stock Siri Remote that comes with the new Apple TV can be used for game play. But I found the gaming experience with the Siri Remote to be lacking. That’s why I decided to pick up a SteelSeries Nimbus wireless game controller.

There’s a series of four LEDs at the top of the controller that indicate how well the battery is charged. I was pleased to discover that my new Nimbus was fully charged. SteelSeries Nimbus lights The Nimbus is a Bluetooth controller. Pairing it with the Apple TV was pretty simple. Turn both devices on. Open the Apple TV’s Settings app, navigate to Remotes and Devices, select Bluetooth, and the Nimbus should appear under Other Devices. From there, you can select the Nimbus for wireless pairing to the Apple TV.

I found that the game controller replicated most of the functions of the Siri Remote and that I could use it to navigate around the main Apple TV screen just like the remote. I selected the game Dragon Mania Legends. As the game loaded, a screen came up that I hadn’t seen before with instructions on how to use a game controller with the game. Game controller instructions (Curiously, the game controller depicted in the instructional graphic looks similar to a Playstation Vita. Not sure what’s going on there.) I’ve found that most games will provide a screen like this. For the ones that don’t, working out the controls is usually not a problem. The Nimbus is a comfortable and familiar controller that resembles an Xbox controller in design. The buttons, D-Pad, and joysticks work well, and the Nimbus really does make for a much more enjoyable experience when it comes to Apple TV gaming. Here’s to hoping that some clever game designers will now make some really good games for the Apple TV. It seems much more likely with controller options like the SteelSeries Nimbus.
