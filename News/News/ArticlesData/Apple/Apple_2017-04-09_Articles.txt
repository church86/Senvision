HTC U Ocean with Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 chipset, Edge Sense to launch in April Home > Technology > iPhone 8 may feature Smart Connector for AR, wireless charging Shobhit Varma   |   @shobhit_tech Last Updated: APR 10, 2017 New Delhi Email Author Although the iPhone 8 is still more than 6 months away, leaks and rumours regarding the device are reaching stratospheric levels. 2017 marks the tenth anniversary of the iPhone and Apple is set to commemorate the occasion by launching a dramatically improved device. A new report from Israeli website The Verifier claims that the iPhone 8 may feature Apple's Smart Connector for wireless charging and for other accessories such as VR/AR headsets. Apple first introduced the Smart Connector in the 12.9' iPad Pro, which uses the connector for accessories such as Apple's external keyboard. The Smart Connector in the iPad Pro provides both data and power for external accessories and connects to them via magnets. The report also claims that AirPlay and new Apple TV hardware will play a key role in Apple's AR/VR vision. Also Read: Samsung Galaxy A7 2017 review: Ticks almost all the right boxes The existence of the Smart Connector on the iPhone 8 hints at the possibility that Apple could introduce new peripherals for the iPhone 8 this year such as a VR headset or smart glasses which could help provide an augmented reality experience. Last year Apple CEO Tim Cook had said he was more bullish about AR compared to VR - "My own view is that augmented reality is the larger of the two, probably by far, because this gives the capability for both of us to sit and be very present talking to each other, but also have other things visually for both of us to see," Cook said. "Maybe it's something we're talking about, maybe it's someone else here that is not here, present, but could be made to appear to be present with us. So there's a lot of really cool things there." After three years of waiting, Apple fans will finally see the introduction of an all new design with the iPhone 8. Leaks and rumours point towards an all glass bezel less-design that will drop Apple's trademark physical home button. The smartphone is also expected to feature a curved display. With the LG G6 and Galaxy S8 both introducing bezel less edge-to-edge displays, it is almost imperative for Apple to follow suit and reduce the iPhone's massive top and bottom bezels. Apple is also expected to shift to an OLED screen from IPS LCD for the iPhone 8. Additionally, Apple is also set to follow in Samsung's footsteps and include an Iris scanner with the iPhone 8 which will allow users to unlock the iPhone 8 with their eyes. The iPhone 8 is also expected to come with 3D cameras. A few weeks ago, Korea's Economic Daily reported that the iPhone 8 will come with LG's Innotek dual lens cameras at the back.

American tech giant Apple has requested unauthorized shops in Vietnam to stop using its logo and trademarks and selling smuggled products. Vo Tran, Apple's legal representative in Vietnam, has sent a copyright infringement warning to several retailers in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, which have been accused of using the famous apple logo and product names such as iPhone, iPad and MacBook, without permission. The notice, issued late last month, said these shops at times also sold unauthorized Apple products. The use of Apple logo and product names has misled customers that these shops are authorized retailers, Apple said, threatening to take legal against violations. Trinh Thai Duong, owner of a mobile retail chain in Ho Chi Minh City, said he received a similar notice from Apple four years ago. Duong said he has been running his business as normal after complying with the request. A lot of Apple products retailed in Vietnam are smuggled from Hong Kong and China, which are usually available sooner than the official ones distributed by Apple's official partners. Smuggled phones can also be cheaper. Apple reportedly opened a subsidiary company in Vietnam in late 2015, allowing it to import and distribute cellphones in Vietnam. Its products are officially imported and sold by a few local tech giants, including FPT and The Gioi Di Dong (Mobile World).

Gaming News PS4 Xbox One Nintendo PC Gaming Mobile Gaming What’s Hot Rumour Gameplay Guide Patch Tech News Mobile Tablet Desktop OS Tech Rumors Trending Anime Movies TV Series Entertainment Sports Social Media World News Contact Us The Bitbag Gaming News PS4 Xbox One Nintendo PC Gaming Mobile Gaming What’s Hot Rumors Gameplay Guide Patch Tech News Mobile Tablet Desktop OS Tech Rumors Trending Anime Movies TV Series Entertainment Sports Social Media World News Reviews iPhone iPhone 8 Rumored With Smart Connector Instead Of Wireless Charging; Vertical Dual Camera Might Be In Too By Kiko Antonio https://twitter.com/kikoTBB on April 10, 2017 12:59 PM Everyday, it would seem like new rumors about the iPhone 8 are getting more and more outlandish. Just like when Apple was first rumored to forego the 3.5mm headphone jack on the iPhone 7. Although many would know by now that Apple aims the iPhone 8 to be a revolutionary device, any ludicrous claim about it is not exactly that surprising. By now, it is not a secret that the tenth anniversary iPhone is said to have wireless charging. However, it would seem that Apple is still sorting out the heat generated by the wireless charging feature. This is perhaps why it is now rumored that the high-end iPhone will include a Smart Connector instead of a full-blown wireless charging module. Apple Smart Connector features According to The Verifier, the iPhone 8 will include that elusive Smart Connect, the same connector that was rumored on the iPhone 7 last year. Right now, the only iDevice with the said interface is the iPad Pro. The tablet uses the Smart Connector to charge and communicate with the tablet for various other features like an external keyboard. While there is no question that the iPhone 8 may be able to support this with the Smart Connector, it will also be used for virtual reality or augmented reality applications. iPhone 8 concept by Moh Slah (via youtube.com) As mentioned, apart from charging the phone, the Smart Connector will also be used for VR or AR applications, with more emphasis on the latter. Apple has been putting a lot of its resources AR research for the past couple of years. In fact, the company has many a number of startup company acquisitions, companies related to AR, in the past few years. Camera for AR/VR With respect to AR or VR, there have been a lot of talks lately about how Apple is going to achieve this. Of course, working closely with a number of newly acquired AR/VR companies is one thing. The other thing is the actual hardware of the technology. As reported many times before, the iPhone 8 will be equipped with a 3D sensor that will not only be used for facial recognition but with AR/VR applications as well. Unfortunately, Apple is still having issues marrying it up with the OLED display due to some difficulties in material bonding. In addition to the 3D sensor, another important hardware on the iPhone 8 are the rear cameras. According to a Twitter post, it seems that the camera arrangement on the iPhone 8 will be vertical instead of horizontal. While this is not exactly new, it is said that this arrangement will make it easier for the hardware to use the cameras for VR or AR applications. My guess. #iPhone8 #iPhoneX #iPhoneEdition pic.twitter.com/JeQDMeWztw — Benjamin Geskin (@VenyaGeskin1) April 7, 2017 iPhone 8 release date With regards to the iPhone 8’s release date, many now believe that it will be much later this year. This is due to reports last week that Apple is still having a number of issues with the assembly, the display being one of them. However, there are still rumors that the phone will go on pre-order the same time the iPhone 7 upgrades are announced. The iPhone 8 is said to carry one hefty price tag. In all the rumors so far, the upcoming phone is said to be priced somewhere north of $1,000. This mainly because of all the new features included in the design. Features like the new curved OLED display, 3D facial recognition, and others have added to the price of the phone. All in all, these bits of information are nothing but rumors. Readers are urged to take these claims with a grain of salt. Apple is yet to release, although very unlikely, an official statement about these claims.

By Deepali Moray | Published: April 10, 2017 9:35 AM IST Email @deepalimoray comments Tags: Apple Apple iPhone 8 Augmented Reality wireless charging News For the upcoming anniversary edition iPhone 8, Apple might introduce a new type of connector that could possibly give the smartphone augmented reality capabilities and also aid in charging. The word on Apple introducing a new type of charging port had been doing the rounds before the launch of the iPhone 7. However, that didn’t materialize. Now, given that this year’s iPhone is already poised to be one of the most premium, feature-rich smartphones by Apple; the ‘Smart Connector for AR and Charging’ might finally see the light of the day. It is worth mentioning that the magnetic Smart Connector was first introduced on the 12.9-inch iPad Pro in 2015. However, it is only aiding in charging the device till now. If the latest rumor from Israeli site The Verifier is to be believed, the next-gen Smart Connector will come with potential AR or VR applications. While the current smart connector is capable of charging the device, it is not known how much data can travel through it per second. Apple CEO Tim Cook has openly talked about the company’s interest in exploring augmented reality technology. Recent reports have also claimed that the iPhone 8 will be equipped with specialized camera lens and technology that will not only aid in facial recognition but also help in enhancing the mapping experience. If one takes into consideration the purported smart connector, it could mean that there will be additional peripherals for the iPhone 8 which could provide the augmented reality experience. Samsung, with its Galaxy S8 lineup, introduced the DeX connector that allows one to achieve desktop experience from the smartphone. With the rumored smart connector, we might be able to see something similar for the iPhone 8, where users are able to connect the smartphone to a peripheral like a pair of glasses for the immersive experience. ALSO READ: Apple iPhone 8 leaked schematics hint at vertical dual-camera setup at the back In addition to the augmented reality experience, the connector is said to finally bring wireless charging capabilities to the iPhone. Following Samsung’s introduction of the wireless charging feature to its premium line of flagship smartphones, iPhone users have long-begged for similar capability for the Apple phones. This year, as the Apple iPhone clocks in its 10th year of existence, it is expected that the company will introduce a newly designed line of iPhones, including a special anniversary edition model which will also be the most premium version of all. For this variant, widely referred to as the iPhone 8, it is likely that the company will ditch the physical Touch ID button and instead place it beneath the display. The display will be edge-to-edge and measure 5.8-inch.  ALSO READ: Apple iPhone 8 leak yet again hints at 3D sensing camera technology In terms of other specifications; recently leaked schematics suggest that Apple will place the dual rear camera module on the iPhone 8 vertically. While the dual camera setup was introduced with last year’s iPhone 7 Plus, the camera positioning is horizontal. Furthermore, this year’s lineup will include successors to the iPhone 7 lineup – the iPhone 7s and the iPhone 7s Plus – all of which will feature Apple iPad Pro-like True Tone displays.

Ahead of its release, Apple put the iOS 10.3 update into beta for developers and those in the free Beta Software Program. The iOS 10.3 beta helped Apple gain valuable feedback about potential bugs and problems. Of course, that didn’t prevent iOS 10.3 problems from emerging in the final release. The bug list included unspecified issues that ultimately forced Apple to halt the iOS 10.3 updates for the iPhone 5 and iPhone 5c. Apple’s replaced iOS 10.3 with an iOS 10.3.1 update, a tiny maintenance update. iOS 10.3.1 didn’t go through a beta, probably because the update is just a few MB in size. And while iOS 10.3.1 might be tiny, it too is causing issues for some iPhone, iPad and iPod touch users. With that in mind we want to take a look at the most important things iPhone, iPad and iPod touch owners need to know about iOS 10.3.1 problems as we push away from the update’s release. This roundup takes a look at the current state of iOS 10.3.1 problems, shows you potential fixes for the most common iOS 10.3.1 issues, and provides some resources that could come in handy if you start to see trouble with your version of iOS 10.3.1. It also takes a look at what’s next from Apple in terms of bug fixes. iOS 10.3.1 Problems It’s early but we’re already hearing about some of the iOS 10.3.1 problems iPhone and iPad users are encountering after installing Apple’s brand new update. The early list includes the usual suspects. iPhone and iPad users are encountering installation errors, weird battery drain, Wi-Fi issues, busted Bluetooth, Touch ID, Siri, and some issues with third-party applications including Facebook. Apple’s discussion forums, Reddit, and social media sites like Twitter are starting to fill up with various complaints about the iOS 10.3.1 update and we expect the list to grow as more people find and install the new software. @Apple @AppleSupport IOS 10.3GM and 10.3.1 both seem to have high battery drain can you address please. Iphone 7+ thanks. — Myklo (@3JustMike3) April 4, 2017 @My_AppleGadgets experiencing battery drain with ios 10.3.1 — Kurt Gilchrist® (@Kurtgilchrist) April 4, 2017 It’s virtually impossible to predict what kind of performance you’ll see on your phone or tablet and this is precisely why we always recommend doing a some prep work before installing an iOS release, even before a small release like iOS 10.3.1. We’ve put together a step-by-step process that will take you through the pre-iOS 10.3.1 installation process we used on our iPhones and iPads. At the bare minimum you’ll want to make a backup of your device. This way you won’t lose any important files. Where to Find Feedback As we push away from the iOS 10.3.1 release date it’s important to keep tabs on the update’s performance. Part of this is monitoring your version of the update for issues. Part of it is digging into feedback from other iOS 10.3.1 users. Digging into some of this iOS 10.3.1 feedback will alert you to potential iOS 10.3.1 problems and it’ll help you find potential benefits of the iOS 10.3.1 update. To start you off, we’ve put together some reasons to and not to install the iOS 10.3.1 update on your device right now. If you’re on the fence about making the move to iOS 10.3.1, start there. We’ve also starting putting together our own impressions of the iOS 10.3.1 update. We’ve started with the iPhone 7, iPhone 6, and iPhone 5 and we plan to publish our thoughts on the iPhone 6s and iPad iOS 10.3 updates in the near future. As always, we also recommend keeping an eye on YouTube, Apple’s discussion forums, social media sites like Twitter/Facebook, and the MacRumors forums for additional feedback about your new iOS update. How to Fix iOS 10.3.1 Problems If you do run into an iOS 10.3.1 problem on your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch, there’s no need to panic. Chances are, you’ll be able to fix your issue from the confines of your home or office. Before you take your iPhone or iPad down to an Apple Store or carrier store you’ll want to try and fix your issue(s) manually. We’ve put together a list of the most common iOS 10 problems and fixes and it’s a great place to start if you’re in trouble. We also recently released a list of tips that could help you improve performance. Some of these will take seconds to complete, others are a little more involved. If you’re unable to find a fix for your issue there, you should go to Apple’s discussion forums for help. There are tons of helpful users there. If Apple’s forums don’t help, you can get in contact with Apple Support via Twitter or the company’s website. If that doesn’t work, schedule an appointment to see a Genius at a local Apple Store. You Can Downgrade to iOS 10.2.1 or iOS 10.3 You also have another option at your disposal. If you think it might improve performance, you can try dropping back down to an older version of iOS 10. At the moment, you’ve got two options: iOS 10.3 or iOS 10.2.1. The downgrade process is pretty straightforward but you’ll want to put away at least 20-30 minutes to get it done. The iOS 10.2.1 and iOS 10.3 downgrades will only be open for a limited time. At some point, Apple will close up them up permanently. Once Apple stops signing on iOS 10.2.1 and iOS 10.3, you’ll be stuck on iOS 10.3 with any problems you might have. For more on the iOS 10.3.1 downgrade process, take a look at our detailed walkthrough. What’s Next A new version of iOS 10.3 is confirmed. The iOS 10.3.2 update is official and it’s currently in beta for developers and those in the free Beta Software Program. The update arrived alongside new beta software updates for tvOS, watchOS, and macOS. The iOS 10.3.2 update appears to be a maintenance release which means it will likely have critical bug fixes and security patches on board. Unfortunately, we don’t know when iOS 10.3.2 will be released to the general public. Apple typically releases several beta updates before pushing the final product. If you’re dealing with an iOS 10.3 problem, make sure you keep a close eye on iOS 10.3.2 and the iOS 10.3.2 beta. 4 Reasons Not to Install iOS 10.3.1 & 7 Reasons You Should Install iOS 10.3.1 If You Want Better Security   1 / 11 If you value your security, you'll want to seriously consider downloading the iOS 10.3.1 update on your iPhone or iPad.  iOS 10.3.1 brings a single security patch for a potential Wi-Fi exploit. But if you failed to install iOS 10.3, your iOS 10.3.1 update will bring its monster list of patches as well.  The iOS 10.3 update delivered over 60 known patches for potential exploits. That's substantial, even for a milestone upgrade. The previous version of iOS 10, iOS 10.2.1, brought 14 known patches. Among them is a patch for a Safari ransomware bug that scammers used to extort iOS users who viewed pornography on their device.  These patches enhance the security on your iPhone, iPad and iPod touch making them ideal for those of you who store sensitive files/data on your device. Most people do. If you skipped the iOS 10.2.1 update and/or the iOS 10.2 update, know that iOS 10.3.1 brings their security patches with it as well. Again, the iOS 10.2.1 update had 14 important patches on board. You can see them all right here.  If you failed to install Apple's iOS 9.3.5 update, iOS 10.3.1 will also bring the three crucial security patches it delivered last year. These patch up serious security problems that could potentially expose your calls, contacts, texts, and emails. If security is important to you, iOS 10.3.1 is probably worth a download right now.   1 / 11 7 Responses 03/30/2017 DopplerDon Barker Reply I installed (or did I) iOS 10.3 and now my phone (6S) will not get past the updating iCloud settings screen despite hard reboots x3. 04/03/2017 jenny Reply My phone keeps searching,fixed it just within 4days its searching again 04/05/2017 Yacine Reply Hello i have mutch problems touch id very slow and the 4g data problems you turn on very slow not fast that all i can say please Apple fix this i have a iPhone 6s 128gb Apple give updates but nothing working good i hope fix this message app little bit slow thanks!!!! 04/07/2017 Josh Orlando Reply I’m currently extracting 10.3.1 as I write this comment since my phone crashed while trying to install last night.

My phone advised there was an update so I went forward with it. Now my Bluetooth isn’t working, all my messages have been erased and none of the messages buttons work (like send for example), when I swipe up from the bottom to access my Control Panel is completely locks up my phone, and even a factory reset with backup restore didn’t work. I am trying a complete reset now with setup as a new phone to see if I can resolve my issues. I will update once done. 04/07/2017 Michele Reply Had to do a full factory reset with start as a new phone options. Appears to have fixed the issue but lost a lot of information. No big deal tho.

A report from Israeli site - The Verifier says that the upcoming iPhone may feature Apple's Smart Connector for inductive wireless charging and can also be used as a VR/AR accessory. For now, Apple uses the Smart Connector only on the iPad Pro section. According to the news report, this special Smart Connector may come on the next-gen iPhone with OLED display. Like other rumors, even this Smart Connector feature has been talked about for a long time. Last year, leaks regarding iPhone 7 stated that iPhone 7 Plus may come with this option placed on the back of it. Also Read: The iPhone 8 to cost less than $1,000: Report The latest report also says that Smart Connector will be helpful for the purpose of wireless charging for the next iPhone 8. That is, the company is developing a Smart Connector variant which offers both the wireless charging and AR features in it. It is already mentioned earlier that only iPad Pro's are using Smart Connector in it currently. In this device, this feature is designed as a port which provides power and data connection to few accessories like keyboards. This was initially introduced in 2015 as a magnetic Smart Connector for 12.9-inch iPad Pro. Few sources claim that the magnetic strength present in the Smart Connector is not ideal to make full use of it.

The Verifier also states that new Apple TV hardware and AirPlay will play a role in Apple's VR/AR vision. Since it is just a rumor, we have to wait and watch until company officially announces it. For now, we know that iPhone 8 will come with an edge-to-edge OLED display, waterproof features, a dual-camera on the back and wireless charging technology.

Apple's iconic Fifth Avenue store in New York City The person did not share any further details, but it's possible that Ebro Darden, one of three Beats 1 radio anchors, could broadcast at least some of his shows at the Fifth Avenue store once it reopens. Currently, he appears to broadcast from a studio in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan. Apple Fifth Avenue, known for its iconic glass cube entrance, has been closed for renovations since January 20. The redesigned store will reportedly have over twice as much square footage, so there will likely be more than enough space for a dedicated Beats 1 broadcasting booth alongside the sales floor. Beats 1 radio anchor Ebro Darden, based in New York City Beats 1 is Apple's internet-based radio station, broadcasted around the clock in over 100 countries around the world. It launched in tandem with Apple Music in June 2015. In addition to Darden, the station is anchored by former BBC Radio 1 host Zane Lowe, based out of Los Angeles, and London's Julie Adenuga. Apple Music executive Larry Jackson recently described Beats 1 as "the biggest radio station in the world," and he claimed there is no other station in existence that has as many concurrent listeners at any given time. Beats 1 can be listened to through iTunes on Mac or PC, or in the Apple Music app on iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, and Apple Watch. Listening is free, with no Apple Music subscription required. Apple has not indicated when its Fifth Avenue store will reopen, but renovations are likely to continue for several months. In addition to more space and a Beats 1 broadcasting area, the store will likely feature Apple's next-generation retail layout, in line with stores in Brooklyn, Brussels, Paris, San Francisco, and elsewhere.

The company is expected to launch three iPhones this year including one with a 5.8 inch OLED display. A new report claims that while iPhone 8 pre-orders might open in September, they may not actually start shipping until “several weeks later.” The report comes from longtime Apple analyst Brian White of the investment banking firm Drexel Hamilton. He writes in his research note to investors that the firm’s contact “strongly believes” that the 5.8 inch iPhone 8 will be delayed by several weeks due to challenges related to the 3D sensing technology. Apple is therefore expected to start taking pre-orders for the handset in September but may not ship it for several weeks. The analyst mentions that Apple will be able to get the smartphone out well ahead of the lucrative holiday season. However, this assumption is based on the information available at this point in time. There’s still a long way to go until September and there’s every possibility that the situation could improve in the coming months. If that does happen, there would be no need for Apple to delay shipments after taking pre-orders. Another expected scenario is that the iPhone 8 might only be available in limited quantities initially with supply being gradually ramped up in the following months. None of this has been officially confirmed by Apple so take it all with a healthy dose of salt for now. Filed in Apple >Cellphones. Read more about iphone 8.

Eight months ago, Canadian security researcher David Coomber discovered that Apple Music for Android 1.2.1 and older doesn't validate the SSL certificates presented when logging into the mobile application and payment servers. As he writes at Bugtraq, that would allow an attacker to silently collect sensitive user information. Apple was notified of the bug in August 2016. The fix landed in the middle of last week when Cupertino released Apple Music for Android Version 2.0, which provided a handy distraction, focussing attention on the app's UI and features. ® Tips and corrections Post a comment More from The Register Apple fans, Android world scramble to patch Broadcom's nasty drive-by Wi-Fi security hole Grab firmware updates ASAP 46 Comments Silver Lake and Broadcom bid $18bn for Tosh memory biz US memory-buying partnership arrives out of the blue 'Amnesia' IoT botnet feasts on year-old unpatched vulnerability New variant of 'Tsunami' is a disaster waiting to happen 9 Comments Dormant Linux kernel vulnerability finally slayed Just, er, eight years later 42 Comments WhatsApp blind-sided by booby-trapped photo vulnerability Same issue in Telegram, says researcher 14 Comments Brocade's sales growth outpaced by costs, ahead of Broadcom buyout Wi-Fi, routing up; SANs down Whitepapers Dynamic Optimization Technology for Infrastructure Resources and Cloud Services Access this Innovation Insight to read Gartner’s recommendations for incorporating dynamic optimisation technology into your infrastructure and cloud initiatives.

Both have compiled enviable performance records for more than half a century. Since 2000, shares of their publicly traded investment vehicles -- Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK-A) (NYSE: BRK-B) and Icahn Enterprises (NASDAQ: IEP) -- have crushed the S&P 500's return. Any sane investor would be happy with either track record. Berkshire Hathaway and Icahn Enterprises vs. the S&P 500, 2000 - present. Data by YCharts. Nevertheless, Buffett's straightforward, patient investment philosophy represents a much better model for investors to try to mimic, rather than Icahn's fast-paced, high-stakes investing style. In particular, Warren Buffett differs from Carl Icahn in having a long-term mindset and a fundamentally optimistic outlook. These are two key traits that individual investors can, and should, try to internalize. Image source: The Motley Fool. Examining the performance records To begin to understand why investors should emulate Warren Buffett rather than Carl Icahn, let's compare their investment records. At first, Icahn might seem to have the superior track record. After all, Icahn Enterprises stock has outperformed Berkshire Hathaway stock by nearly 200 percentage points since 2000. However, Icahn Enterprises is structured as a partnership. This means it doesn't have to pay corporate taxes -- instead, shareholders must pay income tax on their share of the company's earnings. That can lead to hefty tax bills whenever Icahn Enterprises sells an asset for a big gain. Moreover, it's not clear that Icahn's strategy has stood the test of time. Over the past decade, Icahn Enterprises shares have lost more than half of their value. During that same time, the S&P 500 has risen 64%, and Berkshire Hathaway's stock price has more than doubled. (More recently, Icahn's hedge fund has lost money for three years running, including declines of about 18% and 20% in 2015 and 2016, respectively.) Berkshire Hathaway and Icahn Enterprises vs. the S&P 500, 2007 - present. Data by YCharts. Furthermore, even if Icahn is just in a temporary slump, most investors can't afford the extreme volatility of his investment returns. Having less than half of your initial investment after a decade is not an acceptable outcome. Berkshire Hathaway stock has delivered much more consistent growth over time. Lastly, Warren Buffett demolishes Icahn in terms of total wealth-creation. Berkshire Hathaway's market cap has expanded by roughly $340 billion since the beginning of 2000. That's about 50 times greater than the increase in Icahn Enterprises' market cap over that period. Simply put, Carl Icahn has been managing far less money than Buffett, which is a huge advantage in terms of posting big gains in percentage terms. All in all, while Buffett and Icahn both have incredible investing track records when you consider the entirety of their careers, Buffett's performance is more impressive than Icahn's. Slow and steady wins the race From a high-level perspective, Buffett's strategy can be described as buying and holding great businesses with durable competitive advantages. By contrast, Icahn tries to make timely bets on out-of-favor companies that are ripe for a rebound. Let's take a look at two reasons why investors can expect better results from following a Buffett-like approach. Icahn's investments in Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) highlight one flaw in his investment process: short-term thinking. Carl Icahn isn't a day-trader, but he routinely dumps stocks within two or three years of buying them. Thus, even when he finds undervalued gems, he doesn't always fully capitalize on those opportunities. For example, Icahn scooped up about 5.5 million shares of Netflix in 2012 at an average price of $58, just as the stock was bottoming out after falling from a high above $300 the year before. At the time, he thought the company was likely to be acquired soon. No buyout offer materialized. Yet Netflix stock soared anyway as its move into original content began to drive strong growth for its streaming service. Icahn began selling his Netflix shares a little over a year later, by which point they had already more than quintupled in value. By mid-2015, he had closed the position entirely, booking a profit of roughly $2 billion on an initial investment of a little more than $300 million. Icahn's investment in Netflix was clearly a success. Yet Netflix stock has continued to soar in recent years, and it recently surpassed $143 per share (approximately $1,000 per share on a pre-split basis). If Icahn had held on to his original position, he would be sitting on a gain of more than $5 billion by now. Data by YCharts. Around the same time Icahn was selling the last of his Netflix shares, he was talking up Apple stock in a big way. He initially invested in Apple in mid-2013, after the stock price plummeted from a peak of $700 to around $400. Icahn eventually accumulated nearly 53 million shares (accounting for a later 7-for-1 split) at an average price of about $70 per share (or $420 per share in pre-split terms). Icahn then wrote a series of letters urging Apple to buy back stock. These letters pegged the company's intrinsic value at ever more lofty heights, topping out at $240 per share in May 2015. Less than a year later, Icahn had liquidated all of his Apple holdings, winding up with another $2 billion profit (albeit on a larger initial investment this time). He attributed his abrupt change of heart to concerns that Chinese government policies would undermine Apple's growth. And once again, Carl Icahn left a lot of money on the table, as Apple recently returned to EPS growth. If he had held on to the stock, his gains would have reached $3.7 billion by now. Just as Icahn was dumping Apple stock, Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway began accumulating shares. By the end of 2016, Berkshire had acquired more than 61 million shares at an average price of around $110. Buffett more than doubled that Apple investment in January 2017 to about 133 million shares. Berkshire Hathaway has thus profited from Apple stock's recent run, which has left it trading near $140. Apple Stock Performance, data by YCharts. Buffett's Apple stake is now worth more than $18 billion and is already showing a paper gain of more than $3 billion. Unlike Icahn, Buffett is likely to ride out Apple's ups and downs going forward, recognizing that the company is a great business with a bright future. Pessimism doesn't pay (in the long run) A second problem that has dragged Icahn down in recent years is his pessimism. For the past year in particular, Icahn's hedge fund has had a massive net short position -- i.e., a big bet that the market would plunge. During 2016, the losses on these short positions overwhelmed the gains on the few stocks that Icahn's fund owns. By contrast, Warren Buffett is an eternal optimist. In his recent 2016 Berkshire Hathaway shareholder letter, Buffett wrote: "One word sums up our country's achievements: miraculous. ... Starting from scratch, America has amassed wealth totaling $90 trillion." Indeed, the evidence clearly shows that long-term investors should be optimists. A single dollar invested in the market at the beginning of 1871 would be worth about $300,000 today (assuming you reinvested your dividends). Even after adjusting for a century and a half of inflation, the dollar would be worth more than $15,000. Just looking over the past decade, index funds tracking the S&P 500 have generated a total return of more than 100%, despite sustaining a 50% drop during the Great Recession. Data by YCharts. Obviously, bear markets happen, and they can be very painful for investors. A pessimistic investor is bound to be right some of the time. But given that the stock market's long-term trajectory is strongly positive, it's far better to err on the side of optimism and be patient during market downturns than to bet against the market. Great companies are the greatest investments During the course of his long career, Carl Icahn has shown that a savvy investor with plenty of capital can make a boatload of money by shaking up companies that aren't living up to their full potential. His success has paved the way for today's crop of activist investors. Nevertheless, Warren Buffett has demonstrated that it's possible to generate more consistent outperformance by finding great companies and investing in them for the long term. This allows the magic of compounding to go to work, turning years of profit growth into huge gains for investors. That's why investors should aim to invest like Warren Buffett -- not like Carl Icahn. 10 stocks we like better than Berkshire Hathaway (B shares) When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

A new report reveals a 700 percent spike in malware instances in Mac devices in 2016. We’ve always been under the impression that Apple products such as the iPhone, MacBook, and iMac are virtually virus-proof. And figures for the past few years have proven that malware attacks on Apple products have been kept to the minimum. BGR, however, puts to light a new Threat Report published by McAfee Labs, which reveals a huge increase in the instances of malware in Mac devices. According to the latest quarterly Threat Report by McAfee Labs published this month, McAfee was able to detect a total of 460,000 instances of Mac malware in 2016’s fourth quarter, which is a huge 700 percent jump from the previous year during the same quarter. That’s in comparison to the third quarter’s less than 150,000 instances and last year’s slightly over 50,000 malware instances. If this number alarms you, you can calm yourself since as of now, using a Mac is still eons safer than Windows when you’re a virus magnet. According to McAfee’s report, these instances only comprise a small amount of the total number of virus attacks they have detected throughout the fourth quarter of 2016. Apparently, the total number of malware McAfee was able to detect is more than 600 million instances, with the biggest being 15 million virus attacks from Android smartphones. Compared to that number, Mac malware instances drop to a very small percentage of the known cases. .@McAfee_Labs‘ new Threats Report is out! See what our expert researchers discovered about the state of #infosec: https://t.co/dE20EGXURt pic.twitter.com/qsT1fAtfRb — McAfee (@McAfee) April 6, 2017 Albeit small in a macro scale, it’s always better to be safe than sorry. What has been causing these huge spikes in malware attacks anyway? Well, the report notes that the large number of virus attacks on Mac is mostly due to adware bundling, which Fortune explains as “software that automatically displays online advertisements to users when they surf the web.” Unwanted ads have become the norm in surfing the internet that’s why ad bundling has posed a bigger risk in many devices such as the Mac in the past year. But 9to5Mac reminds Mac users that as long as you stay away from downloading fishy apps and files from untrusted sources, these adware will not cause much havoc on your Mac. Only download apps from the Mac App Store and you’ll be fine. These adware bundling instances, however, are different from alarming Mac-based virus attacks throughout 2016, where we saw ransomware take over hundreds of Mac devices, which still comprise a percentage of the threats detected in the report. In August last year, researchers at security website We Live Security have discovered malware OSX/Keydnap, which ships with downloads of torrent client BitTorrent on the Mac. In fact, this ransomware was so alarming it was able to penetrate the official BitTorrent website. Mac ransomware such as OSX/Keydnap works just like a ransom, extorting the Mac user for money. Even Mac devices are vulnerable to virus and ransomware [Image by Shutterstock, Inc.] Another dangerous malware that was found to target Macs in 2016 was Backdoor.MAC.Eleanor, which Mac Rumors explains as an OS X/macOS malware arising from a malicious third-party app called EasyDoc Converter, which poses as a drag-and-drop file converter. The malware basically disguises itself as a harmless third-party Mac app that converts FreeOffice (.fof) and SimpleStats (.sst) docs to Microsoft Office (.docx). Installing the said app into your Mac introduces Backdoor.MAC.Eleanor to your Mac, which lets the attacker enter and access your computer or laptop anonymously. Backdoor programs such as Backdoor.MAC.Eleanor gives the attacker the ability to “access and modify files, execute shell commands, capture images and videos from iSight or FaceTime webcams, and more through a web-based control panel.” It’s actually pretty dangerous, this is why it’s always safer to download from the legitimate Mac store. Never underestimate the golden rule when it comes to protecting your Mac and Apple devices from harmful threats and viruses, which is to never install fishy apps or download files from untrusted sources. Protect your Apple devices by refraining from downloading from untrusted sources [Image by Shutterstock, Inc.] [Featured Image by Shutterstock, Inc.] Now Read This: Samsung Galaxy Note 8 Release Date: First Leak Shows Infinity Display, Confirms Early Launch?

November 15, 2014. PHOTO: Matt Gnaizda/China Uncensored Satirical news show, China Uncensored, says that the Apple TV app store has blocked users from accessing it not only in mainland China, but also in Hong Kong and Taiwan. Curated by Chris Chappell, the show was launched on YouTube in 2012 and is currently aired by New York-based New Tang Dynasty Television (NTD.TV), which is affiliated with Falun Gong — a religious practice that is suppressed in China. The show mocks the Chinese Communist Party and its authoritarian rule by curating news about crackdowns on dissidents, persecution of religious minorities and state-sponsored hacking activities, and turning them into satirical reporting. Often times, its stories are a mixture of jokes and facts that are built upon the stereotypical image of a totalitarian China. In a press statement on April 5, 2017, Chris Chappell stressed: I totally understand why we’re blocked in mainland China. We’re clearly disrupting the Communist Party’s harmonious propaganda…but Hong Kong and Taiwan are not supposed to be under Chinese law. Although Hong Kong is part of China, under the One Country Two Systems principle, the region has an independent legal system. As for Taiwan, it has been a de facto self-governed entity since Kuomingtang of the Republic of China was defeated by the Chinese Communist Party and fled to the island in 1949. In both regions, NTD.TV has reporters covering local news and Falun Gong members are free to practise their religion. in March 2017, Apple approved the China Uncensored Apple TV app for availability in most of the world, but removed it from app stores in mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Apple's legal team said its decision is in accordance with local laws: Apps must comply with all legal requirements in any location where you make them available (if you’re not sure, check with a lawyer). We know this stuff is complicated, but it is your responsibility to understand and make sure your app conforms with all local laws […]. And of course, apps that solicit, promote, or encourage criminal or clearly reckless behavior will be rejected. While your app has been removed from the China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan App Stores, it is still available in the App Stores for the other territories you selected in iTunes Connect. Chris Chappell responded with satirical questions in a press statement: Is Apple so scared of the Chinese Communist Party that it would censor China Uncensored in Hong Kong and Taiwan, just in case? […] Or is Apple just confused about which places belong to China and this was all an accident? They should probably consult a lawyer, like we’ve done. In a letter to Apple CEO Tim Cook on April 3, Chappell urged Apple to unblock the China Uncensored in Hong Kong and Taiwan app stores and vowed that he was prepared to take both legal and political action: …we have retained a public interest attorney who will represent us and is prepared to bring in a major law firm to take legal action, although we would prefer to resolve this matter quickly and without lawyers. If necessary, we are also prepared to discuss this issue with US federal regulators, who, while having no jurisdiction over Hong Kong or Taiwan, are nonetheless concerned with Apple’s business operations in general as Apple moves competitively into the television industry. Since 2013, Apple has started taking down apps — including banned books and circumvention tools — from its China iTunes store in order to comply with local laws. In June 2016, China tightened its control over mobile applications with the introduction of Provisions on the Administration of Mobile Internet Application Information Service. These regulations outlaw applications that spread rumors and information deemed harmful to national security. In January 2017, The New York Times was taken down from the Apple iTunes Store because of such provisions. However, the newspaper’s app remains available in the Hong Kong and Taiwan versions of the store. In the letter to Cook, Chappell stressed that while he is aware of the restrictions in China, the management of Apple's Hong Kong and Taiwan app stores should be different: No doubt, China Uncensored likely falls under some of mainland China’s dubious legal categories such as: Undermining national unity Spreading rumors Disrupting social order There is no point in disputing your app store decision with respect to mainland China… but Hong Kong and Taiwan are not ruled by the Chinese Communist Party. They are regions that operate under independent legal systems. China Uncensored launched a petition on April 4, urging its viewers and supporters to tell Apple to “uncensor” the China Uncensored app from its Hong Kong and Taiwan app stores. As at the time of this publication, more than 5,800 people have signed.

But Buffett is a superior model for investors to follow, due to his patient style and focus on finding great businesses. Adam Levine-Weinberg (TMFGemHunter) Apr 9, 2017 at 8:24PM Warren Buffett and Carl Icahn are arguably the two most successful investors of their generation. Both have compiled enviable performance records for more than half a century. Since 2000, shares of their publicly traded investment vehicles -- Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B) and Icahn Enterprises (NASDAQ:IEP) -- have crushed the S&P 500's return. Any sane investor would be happy with either track record. Berkshire Hathaway and Icahn Enterprises vs. the S&P 500, 2000 - present. Data by YCharts. Nevertheless, Buffett's straightforward, patient investment philosophy represents a much better model for investors to try to mimic, rather than Icahn's fast-paced, high-stakes investing style. In particular, Warren Buffett differs from Carl Icahn in having a long-term mindset and a fundamentally optimistic outlook. These are two key traits that individual investors can, and should, try to internalize. Image source: The Motley Fool. Examining the performance records To begin to understand why investors should emulate Warren Buffett rather than Carl Icahn, let's compare their investment records. At first, Icahn might seem to have the superior track record. After all, Icahn Enterprises stock has outperformed Berkshire Hathaway stock by nearly 200 percentage points since 2000. However, Icahn Enterprises is structured as a partnership. This means it doesn't have to pay corporate taxes -- instead, shareholders must pay income tax on their share of the company's earnings. That can lead to hefty tax bills whenever Icahn Enterprises sells an asset for a big gain. Moreover, it's not clear that Icahn's strategy has stood the test of time. Over the past decade, Icahn Enterprises shares have lost more than half of their value. During that same time, the S&P 500 has risen 64%, and Berkshire Hathaway's stock price has more than doubled. (More recently, Icahn's hedge fund has lost money for three years running, including declines of about 18% and 20% in 2015 and 2016, respectively.) Berkshire Hathaway and Icahn Enterprises vs. the S&P 500, 2007 - present. Data by YCharts. Furthermore, even if Icahn is just in a temporary slump, most investors can't afford the extreme volatility of his investment returns. Having less than half of your initial investment after a decade is not an acceptable outcome. Berkshire Hathaway stock has delivered much more consistent growth over time. Lastly, Warren Buffett demolishes Icahn in terms of total wealth-creation. Berkshire Hathaway's market cap has expanded by roughly $340 billion since the beginning of 2000. That's about 50 times greater than the increase in Icahn Enterprises' market cap over that period. Simply put, Carl Icahn has been managing far less money than Buffett, which is a huge advantage in terms of posting big gains in percentage terms. All in all, while Buffett and Icahn both have incredible investing track records when you consider the entirety of their careers, Buffett's performance is more impressive than Icahn's. Slow and steady wins the race From a high-level perspective, Buffett's strategy can be described as buying and holding great businesses with durable competitive advantages. By contrast, Icahn tries to make timely bets on out-of-favor companies that are ripe for a rebound. Let's take a look at two reasons why investors can expect better results from following a Buffett-like approach. Icahn's investments in Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) highlight one flaw in his investment process: short-term thinking. Carl Icahn isn't a day-trader, but he routinely dumps stocks within two or three years of buying them. Thus, even when he finds undervalued gems, he doesn't always fully capitalize on those opportunities. For example, Icahn scooped up about 5.5 million shares of Netflix in 2012 at an average price of $58, just as the stock was bottoming out after falling from a high above $300 the year before. At the time, he thought the company was likely to be acquired soon. No buyout offer materialized. Yet Netflix stock soared anyway as its move into original content began to drive strong growth for its streaming service. Icahn began selling his Netflix shares a little over a year later, by which point they had already more than quintupled in value. By mid-2015, he had closed the position entirely, booking a profit of roughly $2 billion on an initial investment of a little more than $300 million. Icahn's investment in Netflix was clearly a success. Yet Netflix stock has continued to soar in recent years, and it recently surpassed $143 per share (approximately $1,000 per share on a pre-split basis). If Icahn had held on to his original position, he would be sitting on a gain of more than $5 billion by now. Data by YCharts. Around the same time Icahn was selling the last of his Netflix shares, he was talking up Apple stock in a big way. He initially invested in Apple in mid-2013, after the stock price plummeted from a peak of $700 to around $400. Icahn eventually accumulated nearly 53 million shares (accounting for a later 7-for-1 split) at an average price of about $70 per share (or $420 per share in pre-split terms). Icahn then wrote a series of letters urging Apple to buy back stock. These letters pegged the company's intrinsic value at ever more lofty heights, topping out at $240 per share in May 2015. Less than a year later, Icahn had liquidated all of his Apple holdings, winding up with another $2 billion profit (albeit on a larger initial investment this time). He attributed his abrupt change of heart to concerns that Chinese government policies would undermine Apple's growth. And once again, Carl Icahn left a lot of money on the table, as Apple recently returned to EPS growth. If he had held on to the stock, his gains would have reached $3.7 billion by now. Just as Icahn was dumping Apple stock, Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway began accumulating shares. By the end of 2016, Berkshire had acquired more than 61 million shares at an average price of around $110. Buffett more than doubled that Apple investment in January 2017 to about 133 million shares. Berkshire Hathaway has thus profited from Apple stock's recent run, which has left it trading near $140. Apple Stock Performance, data by YCharts. Buffett's Apple stake is now worth more than $18 billion and is already showing a paper gain of more than $3 billion. Unlike Icahn, Buffett is likely to ride out Apple's ups and downs going forward, recognizing that the company is a great business with a bright future. Pessimism doesn't pay (in the long run) A second problem that has dragged Icahn down in recent years is his pessimism. For the past year in particular, Icahn's hedge fund has had a massive net short position -- i.e., a big bet that the market would plunge. During 2016, the losses on these short positions overwhelmed the gains on the few stocks that Icahn's fund owns. By contrast, Warren Buffett is an eternal optimist. In his recent 2016 Berkshire Hathaway shareholder letter, Buffett wrote: "One word sums up our country's achievements: miraculous. ... Starting from scratch, America has amassed wealth totaling $90 trillion." Indeed, the evidence clearly shows that long-term investors should be optimists. A single dollar invested in the market at the beginning of 1871 would be worth about $300,000 today (assuming you reinvested your dividends). Even after adjusting for a century and a half of inflation, the dollar would be worth more than $15,000. Just looking over the past decade, index funds tracking the S&P 500 have generated a total return of more than 100%, despite sustaining a 50% drop during the Great Recession. Data by YCharts. Obviously, bear markets happen, and they can be very painful for investors. A pessimistic investor is bound to be right some of the time. But given that the stock market's long-term trajectory is strongly positive, it's far better to err on the side of optimism and be patient during market downturns than to bet against the market. Great companies are the greatest investments During the course of his long career, Carl Icahn has shown that a savvy investor with plenty of capital can make a boatload of money by shaking up companies that aren't living up to their full potential. His success has paved the way for today's crop of activist investors. Nevertheless, Warren Buffett has demonstrated that it's possible to generate more consistent outperformance by finding great companies and investing in them for the long term. This allows the magic of compounding to go to work, turning years of profit growth into huge gains for investors. That's why investors should aim to invest like Warren Buffett -- not like Carl Icahn.

Apple continues to refine its iOS 10 operating system with milestone upgrades and maintenance releases. The latest, iOS 10.3.1, is a small update for the iPhone, iPad and iPod touch. Unlike its predecessor, iOS 10.3, the iOS 10.3.1 update brings a few bug fixes and one security update. The iPad’s iOS 10.3.1 update is small but it’s important and worth monitoring as we push into the month of April. If you’re coming to iOS 10.3.1 from iOS 10.3 your update will only be a few MB. If you’re coming from something older than iOS 10.3, your iPad’s iOS 10.3.1 update will be much larger thanks to the fixes and features from iOS 10.3 and/or previous versions of iOS. They’re baked in. This roundup takes a look at the iOS 10.3.1 update’s performance on a few iPad models, the iOS 10.3.1 problems plaguing the iPad, and a quick look at the update that will follow the iOS 10.3.1 update. We’ll continue to update this with new information so check back in as the month goes on. iPad iOS 10.3.1 Update Review: First Impressions   1 / 7 We've installed the iOS 10.3.1 update on four iPad variants: The 9-inch iPad Pro, the iPad Air 2, the iPad mini 2, and the original iPad Air. Over the past few days we've been taking a look at several key areas of performance including including battery life, connectivity, and UI speed.  So far, battery life has been excellent on all three of these iPad models. We have, however, observed abnormal battery drain on the iPad Pro.  For some reason, the YouTube application is not agreeing with Apple's new software and has been draining the device's battery, severely, in the background. If you use the YouTube app on your iPad, this is something to be aware of.  If you recently installed iOS 10.3.1, give the battery a few days to settle in. If you continue to see issues with battery life, you should take action. Apple's next iOS update could still be a few weeks out.  Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are both holding up as well. We've tested these slates with several different ISPs, routers, and Bluetooth devices and we haven't run into any problems with speed or random disconnects. Our connections are stable.  We're using the iPad mini 2 on AT&T's network and we haven't noticed any issues with cellular data. LTE and 4G are working fine.  We haven't noticed any random reboots or freezes/lockups and we've noticed improvements to the UI speed on the iPad Air 2 and the iPad mini 2, particularly when opening up folders and apps. This was an issue for us on iOS 10.2.1 and below. iOS 10.3.1 feels a lot faster.  We'll be back with some more long-term feedback about the iOS 10.3.1 update's performance next week. For now, take a peek at our list of reasons to and not to install the iOS 10.3.1 update right now.    1 / 7 One Response 04/09/2017 Joe U Reply Messaging appears to be messed up after the 10.3.1 upgrade on an iPad Pro. Messages are appearing in the incorrect threads and some phone numbers cannot be reached at all even though they worked just previous to the upgrade. The phone number is not registered with iMessage error now appears even though that same number works on an iPhone. Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) has filed a lawsuit against the local branch of Apple and its US-based parent company, accusing the tech giant of violating and falsely representing consumer rights under Australian law. In a media release earlier today, the government agency announced it has begun proceedings against the Cupertino heavyweight after its investigation indicated that numerous Apple customers, experiencing an iOS software glitch better known as Error 53, have been unfairly denied appropriate service. “This event was off the charts” Gary Vaynerchuk was so impressed with TNW Conference 2016 he paused mid-talk to applaud us. FIND OUT WHY The allegation suggests the company “routinely” refused to aid iPhone and iPad owners with devices previously repaired by third-party service providers – even when the flaw had nothing to do with the repair request. According to the ACCC, Australian Consumer Law stipulates customers are entitled to certain remedies free of charge in cases where “goods and services do not comply with the consumer guarantees” on quality, suitability and durability. The ACCC maintains that “having a component of the Apple device serviced, repaired, or replaced by someone other than Apple cannot, by itself, extinguish the consumer’s right to a remedy for non-compliance with the consumer guarantees.” “Denying a consumer their consumer guarantee rights simply because they had chosen a third party repairer not only impacts those consumers but can dissuade other customers from making informed choices about their repair options including where they may be offered at lower cost than the manufacturer,” said chairman Rod Sims. As a result, the ACCC is seeking pecuniary penalties, injunctions, declarations, compliance program orders, corrective notices and costs. The Big A has long lobbied against the third-party repairment industry for Apple products, arguing such services ultimately put customers at danger. From the viewpoint of Apple, the issue is that unlicensed service providers often tamper with the overall hardware security chain, making it difficult for authorized technicians to troubleshoot malfunctions. For consumers, being forced to go only to Apple authorized service centers could mean a harder time owning and maintaining their devices. While Apple is right to be concerned about maintaining the hardware security chain intact, it is equally commendable that the ACCC is forcing the company to seek more granular approaches to the conundrum rather than simply banning all third-party technicians. Perhaps we all have something to learn from Australia. Read next: Don’t buy Mass Effect: Andromeda (yet) AppleInsights Share on Facebook (89) Share on Twitter (154) Mix is a reporter from Amsterdam.

The rest of the Pascal series cards will follow later this month. It’s a pretty big deal for Mac enthusiasts. Apple has favored AMD’s GPUs for several years now, but enterprising users sometimes install Nvidia cards onto their Macs for greater graphics performance. Ever been to a tech festival? TNW Conference won best European Event 2016 for our festival vibe. See what's in store for 2017. LEARN MORE Though most of what Apple makes doesn’t allow for internal upgrades, the pre-2013 Mac Pro has room for an upgraded graphics card, and you can add an external GPU enclosure – like the Razer Core – to the newest MacBook Pros by using the Thunderbolt 3 port. And then, of course, are those who have built a hackintosh, unencumbered by Apple’s silly limitations. With support for Pascal-series cards, Mac users now have access to the most powerful graphics cards currently available (by a huge margin). Not just a boon for gamers (macOS is hardly the most gaming-friendly OS, after all), it’s a welcome upgrade for anyone who works with complex 3D graphics, as well as high-end video production, where GPU acceleration leads to faster renders and smoother previews. The timing is likely no coincidence. Apple just announced a spec boost for its current Mac Pro (before redesigning the computer altogether next year), which includes updated AMD graphics. Meanwhile, Microsoft just announced the specs for its upcoming Project Scorpio Xbox. That uses AMD graphics, so maybe Nvidia is trying to stick it to Microsoft a little as well. Of course, the fact that it took so long to get Pascal to work on the Mac in the first place is worth acknowledging – if you want support for the latest and greatest graphics, macOS probably isn’t for you. But considering Apple is promising its next Mac Pro will be much more upgradeable than the current generation, there might be some hope after all. Either way, AMD better hurry up with Vega. on Nvidia Read next: Samsung takes on dual-monitor setups with its massive ultra-wide display Gear Share on Facebook (679) Share on Twitter (119) Napier Lopez is a reporter from New York City, US.

According to a study performed by J.D. Power, one of the most prominent marketing research firms around, Microsoft’s Surface tablets edged out Apple’s iPads for the first time ever this year. On a 1,000 point scale, Microsoft scored 855, Apple scored 849, and Samsung 847. The average score for the all brands surveyed was 841. Win a trip to Amsterdam! We've teamed up with Product Hunt to offer you the chance to win an all expense paid trip to TNW Conference 2017! CHECK IT OUT Some of the reasons Microsoft won this year, according to J.D. Power: It has the highest incidence of accessory use among tablets. 48 percent of users use a stylus, compared to the 27 percent industry average, and 51 percent vs 14 percent for the physical keyboard. J.D. Power also suggests customers are more satisfied with Microsoft’s accessories than with competitors. Surface tablets received the highest ratings for variety of I/O connectivity and internal storage. Microsoft scored highest on the ‘attractiveness of tablet design’ category. It also edged out the competition on ‘quality of materials used,’ and ‘size of tablet’ categories. A few of these victories can be explained by the different sorts of consumers Microsoft attracts. Surface buyers are more likely to be using their tablets for productivity, for instance, which is no surprise: Microsoft owners have the highest incidence of saying “very important” for jobs related to productivity. These include browsing the internet (90% vs. 75% industry average); emailing (76% vs. 61%); word processing (63% vs. 30%); and mobile payments/banking (53% vs. 40%). Interestingly, Surface buyers also tend to be younger than others, which goes against the classic Mac vs. PC stereotype (Macs are for young, hip people, PCs are for boring old suits). The study also notes that Microsoft customers are also more likely to be early adopters, and that early adopters tend to have higher overall satisfaction than other folks. Granted, the Surface and iPad series are very different; Microsoft sees the Surface as a full-fledged productivity device, while Apple has never quite suggested the iPad is as productive as a MacBook. Apple also has a greater variety of tablet sizes; I’d like to see how the Surface Pro 4 compares specifically to the 13-inch iPad Pro. Still, it’s a definite victory for Microsoft. Apple has always liked to tout its customer satisfaction numbers during press conferences, and I can’t imagine Jony Ive will be happy to hear people think Surfaces are prettier than iPads. But then, I’ve always long that iPad Pro’s very existence proves Microsoft was right all along. There’s a bright side for everyone though: J.D Power says users are happier with tablets of all kinds than they were just six months ago.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 9 April 2017 by Military News Apple takes supplier clean energy program to Japan Ibiden’s products help bring together the integrated circuitry and chip packages in Apple devices. Their renewable energy projects will produce over 12 MW of solar power — more than the energy they need for Apple manufacturing — and support Japan’s nationwide efforts to limit its carbon emissions. “These innovative new clean energy investments demonstrate our commitment to doing business responsibly and economically,” said Kyoichi Yamanaka, Managing Director of Ibiden’s Environment Group. “Our products help Apple devices run smarter, and now we’re powering our operations with smarter energy too. We’re pleased to partner with Apple and lead the way in helping Japan meet its clean energy goals.” Apple and its suppliers will be generating over 2.5 billion kilowatt hours per year of clean energy for the manufacturing of Apple products by the end of 2018 — equal to taking over 400,000 cars off the road for a year. Apple has taken significant steps to protect the environment by transitioning from fossil fuels to clean energy. Today, the company is powering 100 percent of its operations in 23 countries, and more than 93 percent of its worldwide operations, with renewable energy.

Bank of America will also make a donation for every Apple Pay transaction using its cards, also up to $1 million. Customers around the world can also easily donate directly to (RED) through iTunes. In the US, iTunes Movies is offering a free download of The Lazarus Effect, the documentary about the mission of (RED).

Over the past 10 years, 70 million lives have been impacted by (RED)-supported Global Fund grants. At the start of Apple’s partnership with (RED), 1,200 babies were born with HIV every day, and today, UNAIDS predicts that number could be near zero by the year 2020, with the end of AIDS by 2030. With the life-saving medication costing as little as 30 cents a day, every person can make a difference. Through these efforts we’ll get that much closer to helping (RED) create an AIDS-free generation.

MST April 09, 2017 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST I’ve had big-time battery drain issues on my last three iPhones. I just figured it was my fault — maybe I’m too addicted to apps, take too many photos, or just use my phone too much? It’s an issue I’ve gone to Apple for help with many times. But the Genius’s — Apple's retail support — were flummoxed, too. After the typical troubleshooting: Update iOS? Check. Adjust screen brightness? Check. Use Wi-Fi when possible, turn off location services, and tone down notifications? Check, check, and check again. Nothing seems to solve the issues. Maybe I got the phone wet? It was time to kick things up to the next level. I enlisted experts like Scotty Loveless, a former Apple Genius and iOS tech who told me this would not be another, “turn off every useful feature of iOS posts…” because those “really grind my gears.” Finally, someone speaking my language! With that said, here’s how I finally beat the worst of my battery battles — and now you can, too. #1 Start with your own battery test Your battery should only be doing its heavy lifting when you’re actually using your iPhone, and the rest of the time it should be relaxing in standby mode. Sometimes an app prevents your phone from going into standby and wreaks havoc on your battery life. Here’s how to test it: Go into Settings > Battery. Scroll all the way down to the bottom and you’ll find two numbers, one for Standby and one for Usage. Your Usage number should be way, way lower than your Standby number. If it’s not, you might have a problem, and you can confirm it by jotting down your Standby and Usage times and then clicking the lock button on your phone. Let it sit for about five minutes and then check the numbers again. If your Standby time is five minutes higher, you’re in good shape, but if your Usage time has bumped up by a more than a minute it’s a sign that your phone isn’t resting like it should. On Android, you can get the same information under Settings > Device > Battery (or Settings > Battery if you have a newer version of Android). The information on this menu is essentially the same as it is on an iPhone, and lists “Device Idle” which is the same as standby mode. If you find that your phone isn’t “resting” when you’re not using it, there’s likely a very clear reason, which brings us to #2. #2 Don’t push me When an app is doing things even when you’re not using it, it could be malfunctioning, and stuck in an endless loop that’s draining all your power. That’s what happened to me, with, of all things, one of the email accounts I had connected to my phone. Loveless picked up on this right away. “This happens unbelievably often, especially with Exchange push email,” he said. “I knew when you told me your phone typically dies within six hours of being off the charger, and the Standby and Usage are the same. Sometimes, these times are not the same because the ‘firmware is bad or corrupted,’ but this time it’s because push email is keeping the phone from sleeping properly.” The fix was simple. Go into Settings > Mail > Accounts> Fetch New Data. Mine was automatically set to Push. Loveless recommended that I set it turn that off temporarily and set it to Fetch every 15 to 30 minutes instead. You can also use the Manual mode, which only scans for new messages when you actually open the email app. You can also tweak the push settings to fetch new emails only every hour or so, which is also a big help. You don’t sacrifice timely email updates either, though you’ll still save the most power by disabling push emails altogether. On an Android phone, you can manage the push notification settings for any apps that use it by heading into Settings > Apps and then picking an app and tweaking its individual settings. #3 When background apps are the killer There are other times too when an app is running when you’re not using it and that’s called “Background App Refresh.” There are lots of reasons apps update in the background, like the Music app fetching new playlists, Facebook updating your social feeds, and even Pokemon Go keeping an eye on your steps so you can hatch eggs. It’s all in the name of convenience, but it might also be leaving you with a dead battery halfway through the afternoon. To check out which apps are eating up valuable power in the background go to Settings > Battery and you’ll see a list of the apps taking up your battery life, with the topmost app being the biggest power hog. If you see an app listed with “Background Activity” below it, that’s when you know it’s using power even when you’re not using it. Facebook, Snapchat, Twitter, and streaming apps like Apple Music can be real demons in this department, so head to your Settings > General > Background App Refresh page and toggle off any apps you don’t want working overtime to save some serious juice. #4 Multitasking is OK Do you ever double-tap your home button and see all the apps your iPhone has suspended, waiting for you to go back to them? Whenever I do, I always close them out of instinct, thinking that they must be eating up battery life, right? Nope! In fact, Loveless says that closing apps from the multitasking menu can actually hurt the iPhone’s overall battery life, and for a totally logical reason. Just because you see an app sitting in the multitasking menu doesn’t mean it's actually using your battery life at all — it's just paused, sitting in the phone’s memory and not doing much of anything. When you close it, the phone shuts it down, but when you inevitably open the app back up, it forces your phone to load all that data back up again, and that means it’s using valuable power and ticking down your reserves. Just leave the apps alone and you’ll be doing yourself and your battery a favor. On Android, finding the apps that are running is as easy as pulling the top menu bar down, which brings up a list of the apps either running or paused. You can choose to close them, but again, the idea is that by leaving them on you’re actually saving more power, so just leave them be. #5 Low-power mode can add hours to your battery life Android and iOS both come with low-power features that let you turn off almost all of your phone’s extra features anytime and save tons of energy throughout the day. You can turn it on when the battery drops to 20% or much earlier — by going to Settings > Battery > Low Power Mode and switching it on. On Android, the battery saving feature kicks in automatically if you leave your settings as-is, but you can also manually turn it on by going to Settings > Battery then tap the menu icon and select “Battery Saver.” It can be a real life saver, and it has the bonus benefit of preventing even more battery stress by depleting a dying battery even further than it already is. There are other little things you can do, too, which many other writers have mentioned. But fixing the email and background activity issues on my own phone has already added more than FOUR HOURS of battery life back into my day. That’s nothing short of a miracle in my book.

I just figured it was my fault — maybe I’m too addicted to apps, take too many photos, or just use my phone too much? It’s an issue I’ve gone to Apple for help with many times. But the Genius’s — Apple's retail support — were flummoxed, too. After the typical troubleshooting: Update iOS? Check. Adjust screen brightness? Check. Use Wi-Fi when possible, turn off location services, and tone down notifications? Check, check, and check again. Nothing seems to solve the issues. Maybe I got the phone wet? © Karen Bleier, AFP/Getty Images There are simple steps to help you save battery life on an Android or iPhone. Turns out, closing apps is not one of them. It was time to kick things up to the next level. I enlisted experts like Scotty Loveless, a former Apple Genius and iOS tech who told me this would not be another, “turn off every useful feature of iOS posts…” because those “really grind my gears.” Finally, someone speaking my language! With that said, here’s how I finally beat the worst of my battery battles — and now you can, too.

Sometimes an app prevents your phone from going into standby and wreaks havoc on your battery life. Here’s how to test it: Go into Settings > Battery. Scroll all the way down to the bottom and you’ll find two numbers, one for Standby and one for Usage. Your Usage number should be way, way lower than your Standby number. If it’s not, you might have a problem, and you can confirm it by jotting down your Standby and Usage times and then clicking the lock button on your phone. Let it sit for about five minutes and then check the numbers again. If your Standby time is five minutes higher, you’re in good shape, but if your Usage time has bumped up by a more than a minute it’s a sign that your phone isn’t resting like it should. On Android, you can get the same information under Settings > Device > Battery (or Settings > Battery if you have a newer version of Android).

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 9 April 2017 by Military News How Apple Inc. Makes Most of Its Money It shouldn’t surprise anyone that Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) makes most of its money from the iPhone. After its initial launch in mid-2007, the iPhone gradually replaced the iPod as  Apple’s biggest revenue driver. Between fiscal 2008 and 2016, Apple’s iPhone shipments surged from 11.6 million to  211.9 million. During that period, Apple’s annual revenue rose from $32.5 billion to  $215.6 billion. The seminal iPhone helped Apple crush former mobile kings Nokia and BlackBerry , sparked a tech shift which turned Microsoft and Intel  into underdogs, and made it the most valuable company in the world with a market cap of about $750 billion. Let’s take a closer look at how important the iPhone is to Apple, and why its success is also a double-edged sword. Apple’s iPhone 7. Image source: Apple. How much does the iPhone matter to Apple? The annual launch of new iPhones remains one of the biggest tech events of the year for consumers, tech journalists, Wall Street analysts, and investors. But demand for the phones has clearly been slowing, due to competition from high-end Android rivals and the saturation of major markets like the U.S. and China. That’s why last year’s 211.9 million shipments actually represent an 8% decline from the 231.2 million units the company shipped in 2015. However, analysts believe that the tenth-anniversary iPhone 8 — which will likely feature a glass body, edge-to-edge bezel-less OLED screen, and numerous hardware improvements — will get growth back on track. Goldman Sachs analyst Simona Jankowski believes that iPhone shipments in  calendar 2017 will reach 230 million. Last quarter, Apple’s iPhone sales grew 5% annually and accounted for a whopping 69% of the company’s top line. Apple produces iPhones for about $200 and sells them for over $600. That total excludes R&D, marketing, and other expenses, but it still allows Apple to make a lot more money than Android OEMs, which are selling their devices at much thinner margins. That’s why research firm Strategy Analytics reported that at the end of 2016, Apple raked in 79% of the  entire smartphone industry’s profits, despite controlling just 18% of  the global market. That’s also why Apple constantly promotes its devices as luxury products. It’s also how Apple takes prisoners But it’s not just the hardware revenue that matters to Apple — the iPhone also represents the easiest way to lock users into iOS. After iPhone users start buying apps and media from the App Store and iTunes, they’re less likely to leave behind their purchases by switching to Android devices. Image source: Apple. Apple clearly knows that its lock-in strategy works. That’s why it boldly launched an „upgrade” program which lets people pay for their iPhones on a monthly basis for two years. That plan also gives customers AppleCare+ coverage, and works with all carriers since users are buying an unsubsidized device. After 12 months, users can  switch to the latest iPhone to reset the payment process. It’s highly unlikely that an Android OEM can launch a comparable „forever” plan, since Android users can easily swap between handset brands without losing all their Google Play content. It’s a launchpad for Apple Services That brand loyalty makes the iPhone an ideal launch pad for Apple’s growing Services business, which includes the App Store, iTunes, iBooks, AppleCare, Apple Pay, and Apple Music. CEO Tim Cook has repeatedly stated that Apple plans to grow its software services to offset its gradual slowdown in iPhone sales. Apple’s Services revenue rose 18% annually and accounted for 9% of its top line last quarter, but there have been a few speed bumps. Apple claims that Apple Pay’s user  base tripled over the past year, but Loup Venture recently claimed that just 13% of iPhone users  have ever used the service. Wal-Mart still doesn’t accept Apple Pay, and the service is still  being trampled by Tencent ‚s WePay and Alibaba ‚s AliPay in China. Apple Music hit  20 million paid subscribers at the end of 2016, but questions about the platform’s profit margins persist. Why is the iPhone a double-edged sword? It’s easy to see why the iPhone is a double-edged sword. As long as iPhone sales are rising year-over-year, investors will be happy. But once interest in the iPhone finally fades, Apple needs new products and services to pick up the slack. Mac sales rose and iPad annual sales fell last quarter, but their combined sales only accounted for 16% of Apple’s revenues. The Apple Watch still generates so little revenue that it’s included in the Other Products category, along with iPods, Apple TV, and Beats audio devices. No one is sure what Apple’s next big move will be — whether it be new hardware products, media acquisitions, or connected cars — but most investors agree that it needs to reduce the weight of the mighty iPhone on its top line. 10 stocks we like better than Apple When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The move comes following Apple’s recent claim that Beats 1 is the “biggest” radio station in the world… Mujjo Wallet iPhone 7 Case MacRumors claims that the renovated Fifth Avenue Apple Store will include a “very unique area” dedicated to broadcasting Beats 1. The report cites a “person familiar with the matter” and while specific details are unclear at this point, it makes sense. Currently, Apple music broadcasts out of three main cities: Los Angeles, New York City, and London. As of now, it appears that Beats 1 NYC anchor Ebro Darden broadcasts out of a studio in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan. With a broadcasting setup in Apple’s Fifth Avenue retail store, however, Darden could theoretically broadcast at least some of his shows from there, perhaps in front of a live audience. Furthermore, a broadcasting booth would mean that Apple could hold a variety of live interviews and performances in its Fifth Avenue store. For instance, Eddy Cue interviewed Bruce Springsteen at the SoHo Apple Store last September, but instead of streaming on Apple Music, the interview was streamed on Facebook. Holding high-profile interviews and performances in the store would drive traffic to the retail store and also increase the prominence and awareness of Beats 1. This rumor should be taken with somewhat of a grain of salt as plans could change, but the source has reportedly been accurate in the past. Apple is currently in the process of renovating its Fifth Avenue retail store to be more than double its original size. Earlier this year, Apple officially relocated its Fifth Avenue retail location to commence renovations. The move came following Apple’s renovations of its San Francisco Union Square retail store with a revamped design and “Genius Grove,” and we’d expect of the same ideas to be applied to the Fifth Avenue store, but perhaps with a Beats 1 broadcasting booth as well. Apple’s Fifth Avenue store can currently be found at the vacated space of FAO Schwarz, which is just next door to the cube.

According to prominent developer Steven Troughton-Smith, Apple will drop support for 32-bit apps altogether with iOS 11. This means that many legacy apps will no longer function at all. Mujjo Wallet iPhone 7 Case While the specific source of this tidbit of information is unclear at this point, Smith says that he’s hearing “very clearly” that it is a move Apple will make. In the grand scheme of things, however, it shouldn’t come as too big of a surprise for developers or users. Starting with iOS 10.3, Apple has started alerting users when they open a 32-bit app on iOS. The pop up notification reads that the app must be updated by the developer or else it may not work with future versions of iOS. Apple first started supporting 64-bit applications with the launch of the iPhone 5s in September of 2013. Apple has also required developers to submit new apps with 64-bit support since February 2015 and app updates since June 2015. Apple’s conquest against 32-bit apps really began with iOS 9, however. Here, Apple alerted users that because the app was 32-bit, it may slow down device performance. It only increased the severity of the warning with iOS 10.3. From iOS 10.2.1: “Waterslide” May Slow Down Your iPad The developer of this app needs to update it to improve its compatibility. And iOS 10.3 beta 1: “Waterslide” Needs to Be Updated This app will not work with future versions of iOS. The developer of this app needs to update it to improve its compatibility. Furthermore, Smith notes that it “sounds like” future processors from Apple won’t even include 32-bit support, a move that could free up performance/die space for users and developers. Apple’s goal with this gradual phase out of 32-bit apps is likely that the end-user isn’t affected by it, but rather developers work to ensure that their apps are updated before support has been completely dropped. The move comes as Apple has detailed plans to remove “problematic and abandoned apps” from the App Store in one of its first moves to focus on app quality over catalog quantity. Apple detailed these goals in September of last year and the following month, Apple was said to have removed nearly 50,000 apps from the App Store. Devs: I'm hearing very clearly iOS 11 won't have 32bit app support at all. Update legacy apps now if you want them to survive past September — Steve T-S (@stroughtonsmith) April 8, 2017 (…and it sounds like future A-series chips won’t even include 32-bit support.

IE Home Nation World Opinion Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Technology Viral Photos Videos E-Paper Apps RSS Gadgets Review Photos Videos Mobile & Tabs Science Indian Express Home Home Technology Mobile & Tabs Apple iPhone 8 to feature Smart Connector for wireless charging, VR/AR accessories: Report Apple iPhone 8 to feature Smart Connector for wireless charging, VR/AR accessories: Report Apple's next-generation iPhone 8 will include a Smart Connector for inductive "wireless" charging, according to a new report. By: Tech Desk | New Delhi | Updated: April 10, 2017 10:30 am Apple currently uses the Smart Connector on the company’s flagship iPad Pro lineup. A new report from Israeli site The Verifier claims that Apple’s next-generation iPhone 8 will include a Smart Connector for inductive “wireless” charging. The Smart Connector will apparently also support for accessories synced to augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) as well. It’s worth mentioning that Apple currently uses the Smart Connector on the company’s flagship iPad Pro lineup. The Smart Connector on iPad Pro models is basically designed to support accessories, like keyboards. The magnetic Smart Connector was first debuted on the 12.9-inch iPad Pro in 2015. This isn’t the first  time that an iPhone has been rumoured to come with a Smart Connector. Last year, before the launch of the iPhone 7 Plus, an alleged image of the device was cropped up which showed the phone with the connector built in. Also read: Apple places order for 70 mn OLED panels for iPhone 8: Report Additionally, it’s been long rumoured that Apple will be adding wireless charging capabilities to the iPhone 8, and Reuters has also reported that they have cited a person with knowledge of the matter that Apple has at least five different groups working on wireless charging within the company. Just to refresh your memory, Apple recently joined the Wireless Power Consortium, a group of 214 companies dedicated to promoting wireless charging through its “Qi” standard. The Verifier also reports that the Smart Connector on the iPhone 8 would also be used for augmented and virtual reality applications and accessories, while it notes that a new version of the Apple TV is in the works. Apparently, it may also come with support for AR/VR capabilities. Apple is expected to release the iPhone 8 in September; however, according to the Economic Daily News the device could be delayed by weeks due to difficulties related to the 3D sensing technology and curved OLED panels rumoured to debut on the phone. The anticipated device is said to feature an all-new design and edge-to-edge OLED display. It is expected to resemble the Galaxy S8, as it may not feature a physical home button. Plus, the Touch ID might be embedded under the True Tone display.

Apple may be planning to launch a Smart Connector for Augmented Reality and Charging. According to a news report from Israeli site The Verifier has revealed that there is a strong chance that Smart Connector would arrive on the OLED iPhone. The report also stated that Smart Connector would help facilitate wireless charging for the new iPhone 8, but there aren’t any details as to how that would actually happen. Perhaps, Apple is developing a variant of the Smart Connector, in order to provide wireless charging and AR features. The Smart Connector on the current iPad Pro models is a port designed to provide power and data connection to accessories, like keyboards. The magnetic Smart Connector was introduced on the 12.9-inch iPad Pro in 2015, but it is not known how much data actually passes through the port. It is worth mentioning that Apple could very well use the Lighting port to connect the iPhone to AR or VR accessories, as some say the magnetic strength on the Smart Connector is not ideal. Apple TV hardware and AirPlay would also play a role in Apple’s VR/AR technology for the upcoming iPhone 8. Last year there were several reports pointing to the fact that the iPhone 7 will incorporate the Smart Connector, but they did not materialize as the lineup last year did not feature the port found on the iPad Pro. We should however suggest that this information should be taken with a grain of salt, as there are no other reports which indicate such a feature on the iPhone 8. What is already known is that the anniversary iPhone will feature an edge-to-edge OLED display, waterproof features, wireless charging and a dual-camera setup on the back. At this point, it’s unclear as to when the OLED iPhone will launch, but it is expected to be announced in September, together with the iPhone 7s and the 7s Plus.

The Blue Springs Police Department issued an Amber Alert Sunday morning after the possible abduction of 12-year-old Apple S. Briscoe on Saturday night at 2514 N.W. Sixth Street in Blue Springs. Police say Apple met William L. Dela Cruz, 22, online and was last seen getting into a vehicle with him. Police believe he was with his brother, Jason A.

Dela Cruz was taken into custody. Jason A. Dela Cruz was found in Columbus, Ohio, and turned himself in, Jennifer Dachenhausen, a public information officer for the Blue Springs Police Department, wrote in an email Sunday night.

But when it comes down to what this “party of the people,” Democrats included, actually does on a day-to-day basis, it becomes clear that many of these folks are tried-and-true hypocrites. Take the anti-fossil fuel crowd, for instance. These folks would love nothing more than to convert society into a hybrid-driving, mass transit-taking “green” paradise. But little do they know that even these modes of transportation include the use of things like petroleum-based plastics and batteries that run off of rare earth minerals that greatly contribute to environmental destruction. Despite their better gas mileage ­– or in the case of electric cars, general mileage – fuel-saving and fuel-eliminating vehicles still run on energy that has to come from somewhere. Both coal and nuclear power plants provide electricity for electric cars at a substantial rate in the U.S., and neither of these methods is considered safe or “green” by any stretch of the imagination. “Although the battery-powered car itself doesn’t produce any emissions, the power plant that generates the electricity used to charge those batteries probably does,” writes David Biello for Scientific American. Or how about the ever popular iPhone? Plenty of progressives carry around these devices, often with an Apple portable computer in tow as well, despite Apple’s widely-published failure to protect its overseas workers in places like China. Working conditions at these Apple factories are so bad that some workers are committing suicide as an escape. “Even if I was hungry, I wouldn’t want to get up to eat. I just wanted to lie down and rest…” reported one Apple worker to an undercover BBC correspondent about how exhausted he is after a day on the job building iPhones. According to this same gentleman, he often has to work 16-hour shifts just to keep up with the demands of his superiors. “I was unable to sleep at night because of the stress.” Solar panels, CFL lightbulbs not nearly as ‘green’ as progressives would have us all believe Another big buzzworthy topic for progressives is the use of solar panels, which are supposed to be a clean source of energy to replace things like coal and nuclear power. Solar panels appear to be sustainable in that they provide unlimited energy, so long as the sun is shining, without the need for a reactor or some other external input. But a closer look reveals that these, like the batteries in electric and hybrid cars, require rare earth minerals that can be difficult to obtain. Besides their scarcity, these rare earth minerals require extensive excavation to be dislodged from their underground locales. The same is true for other “green” technologies like LED and CFL lightbulbs, which were supposed to save the planet from global warming. “The move toward new and better technologies – from smart phones to electric cars ­– means an ever-increasing demand for exotic metals that are scarce thanks to both geology and politics,” explains a report by Yale University. “Thin, cheap solar panels need tellurium, which makes up a scant 0.0000001 percent of the earth’s crust, making it three times rarer than gold. High-performance batteries need lithium, which is only easily extracted from briny pools in the Andes.” There will come a point, in other words, when even many “green” technologies exceed all the hype and reveal themselves to be unsustainable. The world is already seeing this with the growing rarity of the materials required to manufacture them.

With the Samsung Galaxy S8 already released, all eyes are focused on Apple, the innovator of the touchscreen smartphone, to wow consumers with its latest device, the iPhone 8, or the iPhone Edition, as stated in previous rumors. As the speculated September 2017 release date approaches, however, reports have emerged that the iPhone 8 would be released later than usual. Despite this, it appears that Apple’s massive user base has remained unfazed. According to a recent DigiTimes report, the iPhone 8 would most likely see a delay in shipments once it is released. The report further stated that unlike previous years, the iPhone 8 would be released around October or November instead. The delay, the report claims, is due to technical issues that are plaguing the iPhone 8’s manufacturing process, especially regarding its curved OLED screens and the device’s 3D sensing front camera. Considering that DigiTimes has a mixed record with its accuracy Apple’s release dates, however, numerous fans have mainly brushed the information in the report aside. Apple, after all, is a very time-efficient tech firm, and it rarely releases its most critical devices such as the iPhone at a later date than expected. 3D artist Martin Hajek imagines what #iPhone8 with nearly full-screen face might look like pic.twitter.com/UBXDg9LkTH —  iBuy. iSell. iSwap (@iTech911) April 6, 2017 Recently, however, another report has emerged alleging a similar delay. According to a MacRumors report, noted Apple analyst Brian White has stated that consumers would indeed see a delay with regards to the iPhone 8’s release. Unlike the DigiTimes report, however, White stated that the iPhone 8 would still be released in September 2017 as expected. The delay would only apply to the actual availability of the devices on the market. In White’s estimates, consumers would most likely be able to purchase an iPhone 8 until several weeks after the September release date. “Our contact strongly believes the 5.8-inch iPhone 8 will be delayed by several weeks due to challenges around the 3D sensing technology, but still in time for the December holidays. This is not the first time that we’ve heard about a potential delay with a new iPhone; however, our contact was so emphatic about the delay that we are taking this data point more seriously. “Since it is only April, this situation could improve. Essentially, our contact believes customers will be able to pre-order the new 5.8-inch iPhone 8 along with the new 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch iPhones in September; however, the 5.8-inch iPhone 8 will not be available for delivery until several weeks later.” This iPhone 8 concept won't forget the iPhone's roots – CNET https://t.co/v5amgLEpdz #iPhone8 pic.twitter.com/TOgZuYrucH — iPhone 8 News (@iPhone8News) April 6, 2017 Despite the rather disheartening news, however, many Apple fans in online forums have stated that delay or no delay, the iPhone 8 would definitely be a massive hit in the market. Others have said that Apple has a lot of time to release the iPhone 8, considering that users are still enjoying their iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Apart from this, Apple has also recently released a (product)RED iPhone 7 recently, which has managed to rekindle the interest of the Cupertino-based tech giant’s massive fanbase. Thus, while there is a chance that the iPhone 8’s shipments would experience a delay, there is also a very real possibility that Apple’s reputation and mass support from its loyal users would be able to weather down the upcoming device’s rumored production issues. The iPhone 8 is arguably Apple’s most important device to date. Being the 10th-anniversary iteration of its most successful product, the iPhone 8 is rumored to pack features and innovations that have been held back by the tech firm for years. Among these include a new design, a revolutionary new 3D front-facing camera, and a high-resolution OLED display that would finally enable the device to catch up to its most formidable Android rivals.

Make no mistake: We're still probably at least a decade away from any kind of meaningful shift away from the smartphone. (And if we're all cyborgs by 2027, I'll happily eat my words. Assuming we're still eating at all, I guess.) Yet, piece by piece, the groundwork for the eventual demise of the smartphone is being laid by Elon Musk, Microsoft, Facebook, Amazon, and a countless number of startups that still have a part to play. And, let me tell you: If and when the smartphone does die, that's when things are going to get really weird for everybody. Not just in terms of individual products but in terms of how we actually live our everyday lives and maybe our humanity itself. Here's a brief look at the slow, ceaseless march toward the death of the smartphone — and what the post - smartphone world is shaping up to look like. The short term People think of the iPhone and the smartphones it inspired as revolutionary devices — small enough to carry everywhere, hefty enough to handle an increasingly large number of daily tasks, and packed full of the right mix of cameras and GPS sensors to make apps like Snapchat and Uber uniquely possible. But consider the smartphone from another perspective. The desktop PC and the laptop are made up of some combination of a mouse, keyboard, and monitor. The smartphone just took that model, shrank it, and made the input virtual and touch-based. So take, for example, the Samsung Galaxy S8, unveiled this week. It's gorgeous with an amazing bezel-less screen and some real power under the hood. It's impressive, but it's more refinement than revolution.​ Tellingly, though, the Galaxy S8 ships with Bixby, a new virtual assistant that Samsung promises will one day let you control every single feature and app with just your voice. It will also ship with a new version of the Gear VR virtual reality headset, developed in conjunction with Facebook's Oculus. The next iPhone, too, is said to be shipping with upgrades to the Siri assistant, along with features aimed at bringing augmented reality into the mainstream. And as devices like the Amazon Echo, the Sony PlayStation VR, and the Apple Watch continue to enjoy limited but substantial success, expect to see a lot more tech companies large and small taking more gambles and making more experiments on the next big wave in computing interfaces. The medium term In the medium term, all of these various experimental and first-stage technologies will start to congeal into something familiar but bizarre. Microsoft, Facebook, Google, and the Google-backed Magic Leap are all working to build standalone augmented-reality headsets, which project detailed 3D images straight into your eyes. Even Apple is rumored to be working on this. Microsoft's Alex Kipman recently told Business Insider that augmented reality could flat-out replace the smartphone, the TV, and anything else with a screen. There's not much use for a separate device sitting in your pocket or on your entertainment centre if all your calls, chats, movies, and games are beamed into your eyes and overlaid on the world around you. At the same time, gadgetry like the Amazon Echo or Apple's own AirPods become more and more important in this world. As artificial-intelligence systems like Apple's Siri, Amazon's Alexa, Samsung's Bixby, and Microsoft's Cortana get smarter, there will be a rise not just in talking to computers but in having them talk back. In other words, computers will hijack your senses, more so than they already do, with your sight and your hearing intermediated by technology. It's a little scary. Think of what Facebook glitches could mean in a world where it doesn't just control what you read on your phone but in what you see in the world around you. The promise, though, is a world where real life and technology blend more seamlessly. The major tech companies promise that this future means a world of fewer technological distractions and more balance, as the physical and digital world become the same thing. You decide how you feel about that. The really crazy future Still, all those decade-plus investments in the future still rely on gadgetry that you have to wear, even if it's only a pair of glasses. Some of the craziest, most forward-looking, most unpredictable advancements go even further — provided you're willing to wait a few extra decades, that is. This week, we got our first look at Neuralink, a new company cofounded by Musk with a goal of building computers into our brains by way of "neural lace," a very early-stage technology that lays on your brain and bridges it to a computer. It's the next step beyond even that blending of the digital and physical worlds, as human and machine become one. Assuming the science works — and lots of smart people believe that it will — this is the logical endpoint of the road that smartphones started us on. If smartphones gave us access to information and augmented reality puts that information in front of us when we need it, then putting neural lace in our brains just closes the gap. Musk has said this is because the rise of artificial intelligence — which underpins a lot of the other technologies, including voice assistants and virtual reality — means humans will have to augment themselves just to keep up with the machines. If you're really curious about this idea, futurist Ray Kurzweil is the leading voice on the topic. The idea of human/machine fusion is a terrifying one, with science-fiction writers, technologists, and philosophers alike having very good cause to ask what even makes us human in the first place. At the same time, the idea is so new that nobody really knows what this world would look like in practise. So if and when the smartphone dies, it'll actually be the end of an era in more ways than one. It'll be the end of machines that we carry with us passively and the beginning of something that bridges our bodies straight into the ebb and flow of digital information. It's going to get weird. And yet, lots of technologists already say that smartphones give us superpowers with access to knowledge, wisdom, and abilities beyond anything nature gave us. In some ways, augmenting the human mind would be the ultimate superpower. Then again, maybe I'm just an optimist. Get the latest Google stock price here.

Tech Apple Science Cars Samsung Nintendo Switch iPhone 7S & 8 Nintendo NES     Here Is When Apple Watch Series 3 Will Be Made Official Posted: Apr 9 2017, 11:46am CDT | by Ahmed Humayun, in Rumors | Apple      A huge breakthrough report by Digitimes from a highly trusted source surfaced today, claiming that the Apple Watch Series 3 will be rolling out the red carpet in the latter half of this year. The report lacked specifications and performance details of the upcoming iteration of Apple’s wearable Watch Series. This report now solidifies the authenticity of rumors which surfaced earlier, claiming that Apple Watch Series 3 will be announced this fall. Don't Miss: Find a Nintendo NES Classic in stock Suggesting that we trust to other rumors surfacing right now, we could conclude that Apple Watch Series 3 will be coming with various performance upgrades and longer battery life. Various sources are hinting towards a possibility of LTE support finally arriving in the upcoming series of Apple’s wearables. Analysts believe that the new smart wearable-series will be quite similar to the previous models in terms of design, shape, and dimensions. Apple introduced the Apple Watch Series 2 last year in the same event which debuted the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, Apple’s flagships of 2016. There is a high chance that Watch Series 3 will be released in the same event as the release-event of Apple iPhone 8, iPhone 7S, and iPhone 7S Plus. Also, Watch Series 2 will reportedly stay up on Apple’s store along with Apple Watch Series 3. Compal is expected to be trusted with manufacturing of some of Apple’s last year’s orders. Quanta, the one-and-only manufacturer of Apple Watch Series 2 will step-off from the current contract to produce Apple Watch Series 3 units. This story may contain affiliate links.

Shares of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) dipped 32 cents last week (about 0.2%), closing at $143.34 on Friday. The stock posted a new 52-week high on Wednesday. But the company remains the best-performing stock by a wide margin among the 30 equities the comprise the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). The company’s stock is up 23.76% year to date, well above Boeing’s 14.88% improvement. The week started out with an announcement from Imagination Technologies that Apple will cut its ties with the U.K.-based company within the next 15 to 24 months. The company supplies the graphics processing unit (GPU) for Apple products, and the London-traded company said that Apple “has asserted” that it is developing its own graphics design technology “in order to control its products” and that Apple will “be reducing its future reliance” on Imagination’s technology. That was bad news for the U.K. company and not especially interesting news for Apple investors who moved the stock up just 4 cents on the day of the announcement. Later in the week reports surfaced that the next iPhone would not ship on time. The first report blamed difficulties in manufacturing the curved glass OLED display and the second report noted challenges to the development of the device’s 3D sensing technology. Apple shares closed at $143.34 on Friday in a 52-week range of $89.47 to $145.46. The consensus 12-month price target is $147.61 in a price target range of $102 to $185 per share.

The iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus may not deliver super screen resolutions, but they hit the right notes for many buyers and with iOS 10 there are even more reasons the iPhone is better than Android for many users. iPhone competition includes the Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge, One Plus 3, the LG V20 and other phones that deliver a bigger challenge for Apple — but there are still places where the iPhone is clearly better than Android and iOS 10 is better than Android Nougat. Many of these could change with the Galaxy S8 and the LG G6 later this year, but for now – iPhone has an edge. You need to learn what the iPhone does better and how Apple delivers a better experience than Android to see if an iPhone is the best smartphone for you in 2017. Here are 15 reasons the iPhone is better than Android phones in 2017. Use our list of reasons the iPhone is better than Android to figure out which new smartphone you should buy this year. Read our iPhone 7 review to learn what sets this phone apart from the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus. You can buy the iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus at a discount with the best iPhone 7 Black Friday deals. Read: Siri Tips & Tricks Even if you think you know which phone is best, you might be surprised to learn about all the reasons the iPhone is better than Android. iPhone Apps Are First and Better Looking Most of the popular apps are on both platforms, but many top games and apps still come to iPhone first. We’re seeing more apps come to both Android and iPhone at the same time, but there are still way more iPhone only apps that we see than Android only. When apps are available on iPhone and Android we still often see a better design on the iPhone version than on Android. This is something that still rings true in 2017. For example, we still see some new Snapchat features and Spotify features come to iPhone before Android. iPhone owners are enjoying Super Mario Run, but the Super Mario Run Android app is still on the way. Read: Best iPhone Apps Apps are an area where the gap is closing, but the differences still exist and are noticeable. We also see Apple take better care of the App Store. Recently they purged 47,300 apps from the app store that were simply bad or abandoned. Fast iPhone Updates for All iPhone owners enjoy quick and regular iOS updates for the iPhone no matter what carrier they use. Faster updates are available for all iPhone owners. Android updates take months to arrive on all the devices. After an Android device is 18 months old, you may need to wait for a new Android smartphone to get the latest software. Apple delivers iPhone updates to devices that are three years old. Apple offers iPhone 4s iOS 9 support. It is unheard of to see support for an Android phone that old. iOS 10 is available for the iPhone 5. When you look at Android devices support ends much faster. Google promises at least two years for Nexus devices, which means Nexus 6 support ends this fall and the Nexus 6P in September 2017. Google may push farther out, but it is not a guarantee. Other Android device manufacturers don’t typically match the longevity of iOS updates. On top of the added update support, Apple does not allow carriers to hold up the updates. As soon as the update is available from Apple it is available on every carrier. If you really want Android Nougat, you may need to simply buy a new Android phone. Works Great with All Your Devices If you own an iPhone, iPad and Mac your information flows smoothly from one device to the other. You can quickly sync photos to all of your devices, answer a phone call on your iPad or Mac and send text messages from your other devices. There is also support for Handoff that allows you to start a task on your iPhone and continue on your iPad or Mac. The iPhone works great with the iPad and Mac. Overall the connectivity between these devices is something Android doesn’t yet match without relying on a collection of third-party applications and services to hodgepodge together a similar feature. Sharing a file from your iPhone to your Mac is also faster and easier thanks to AirDrop. This built-in service sends the file wirelessly directly to the Mac, even when there is no other WiFi around.

You simply can’t go wrong. I own an iPhone 5, iPad Mini 3, MacBook Pro, iMac, and Apple TV. I would not even consider anything else, especially something from that “G…” company which I abhor. I won’t even use their search engine. Same goes for anything from that software manufacturer that, well, just call it “MS). Try calling any other manufacturer for support and see if you can understand what they are saying. I suppose I am bias toward Apple but after nearly 30 years of dealing with computers of all sorts I guess my opinion is warranted. 07/17/2015 gabe Reply why people like iphones? I never understood why anyone would like to give control to another company of what you do with their device. why force u to follow MEDIA SHARING and digital rights media? you cannot torrent on iPhone, nor transfer music and videos without ITunes or a paid online service in iOS. I hate that Samsung s6 tried copying apple iPhone. no microsd slot and integrated battery. CMOn! 04/06/2016 Sai Reply You ever used apple ? 07/05/2016 greentoe Reply http://gtoe.me/l/7A0q-A-04r 02/27/2017 david Reply yea 03/31/2017 bitchmaster64 Reply You don’t know me, but my name’s Sai. I’m just the O’Hare delivery guy. But it seems like trees might be worth a try, so I say let it grow. 03/04/2017 Evie Reply It is simply the portability. I have watch ,I go to the gym. I have apple computer and I can receive my phone calls there and iMessages. It crashes less often than microsoft does. I can contact apple support, whenever I want. The other time ,the bluetooth in my iPhone did not work, I contacted tech support midnight and they were available. We could not fix the problem. They called me the next day and told me to go to the nearest store and pick up a brand new phone. One more thing, my iPhone was out of warranty for 165 days. They told me they cared about customer satisfaction. When I called microsoft in order to talk to me they wanted $250. Now, compare 12/02/2015 Zombieknight Productions Reply You’re literally so idiotic that you can’t spell the full name of a company. Only Apple, cuz you’re an I sheep. You can go very wrong. If people were smart these days, they would understand that iPhones are unequivocally not the right choice for them. You wouldn’t recommend anything else, because it is too limited and unintelligent to use anything else. Stop trying to influence other people to buy garbage phones and devices 05/12/2016 Nancy Reply Why are u being a hypocrite calling someone idiotic for not knowing how to spell the company name right when some of ur sentences don’t even make sense. Apple doesn’t have any competition be used it is the best phone to get. 07/13/2016 Rona Reply First of all, don’t criticize someone for calling someone else idiotic when you can’t even use proper spelling or grammar. Second, Apple is all marketing. There is nothing special about it. Android offers phones that have expandable memory (and guess who doesn’t?) and better high-speed data services. iPhones die extremely quickly, you can’t use iTunes on any other devices, whereas Android platforms are available on all devices, the picture quality on an iPhone is pathetic compared to Androids, and Apple products are majorly behind in technology. The latest update for an iPhone came out two years ago for an Android. Apple has a set array of things it can do, and you can’t customize or change that. But if you want a high-end technology phone, choose an Android. It does so much more and you can customize and change its features. I have had both an iPhone and an Android phone. 09/14/2016 Abhishek well,mam i am an android user and i would like to say that iphones are the best because when you buy an android first it will give you good performance but after one month it will start hanging and work slow and that is same with every android devices.and their are so many android malware which also affect performance. Iphones are the best, secure and stable. 09/15/2016 Me Stay butthurt, loser ; ) 12/04/2016 jgames “nothing special about it” fastest phone ever 3d touch very good camera looks very nice “nothing special about it” why do we need expandable memory on iOS? gime a few reasons for that. “better high-speed data” give me your source for all this information. iphones die extremely quickly? how? do you even have an iphone? iphones have much better standby and screen on time with heavy usage than android. you cant use itunes on other devices, yes, but ios wants to keep it ios exclusive because their services are one of the major selling points for them. android platforms are available everywhere, but google software is usually preferred to ios software. pathetic picture quality? wut? iphone pictures wont lose quality when you zoom in and support much more colors than any old android camera. android cameras are very nice as well, though. “apple are behind in technology” a lot of people say this but it’s actually quite the opposite. 3d touch was very innovative, its like a ‘right click’ for your phone. the latest iphone update did not come out 2 years ago. you seem like you have no idea what you’re talking about and just spouting nonsense. apple can do a lot of things without customization, but what customization do we really need? people always saying android is more customizable but never give examples, and when they do its “homescreen.” moving home screen icons around is a pretty useless feature tbh android isnt more high end tech than iphone and i dont see how much more it does. you havent even explained how it can in your comment. so please use common sense before spouting nonsense 02/27/2017 Gage iPhones are by far the better phone. I’ve had android phones for most of my life but i bought an iPhone 6 about a year ago and now I have the 7 and I can’t imagine going back. Android is slow, every button you push there’s a lag before it actually opens the app or whatever you pushed. Also, every android I’ve ever had has had terrible battery life, it never lasts the full day but my iPhone almost always does. And my last point, android automatically installs like 10-20 on your phone that you cannot delete no matter how hard you try. Apple has 3-5. Yes, android has a port for SD cards, but what good is that if a large amount of your memory is made up of apps you don’t want. You’re entitled to your opinion but I advise that you get yourself an iPhone 7 and keep an open mind. I’m fairly certain you realize how much better it is 05/23/2016 Anthony Reply Not very nice. Also, Apple is just as good as Android, theres aspects that one company has over the other, and vice versa, so the best thing to do is just to test out both and find your favorite and use it because Android and Apple’s problems and advantages weigh out each other so it really just matters which one you like the most so just use the one u like and stop arguing. 08/19/2016 Zane Reis Reply I prefer Android because of the coustomization it has to offer. I prefer to be able to change change almost every aspect about my phone and making it the way “I” like it, not the way Apple likes it. I like the coustomization while others find it chaotic, confusing, and would rather it be (in their eyes) simpler. 05/26/2016 Billy Reply Says the one who has Zombie Knight as their username. 07/18/2016 Nate Pauley Reply That’s an interesting rather stupid mindset to have and it makes me reflect on the time I had those same views. It took me 6 years as an android user to eventually realise how inferior it is to iOS. Android is plagued with fragmentation, so much that not even customisation can save it. There should be a term that describes blindsided android followers, if there is one then I’d like to know it. iOS is solid, stable, secure and much more better looking than android – Apple pays exquisite attention to the finer details and they will continuously improve on the irritating nooks and crannies so many people mention in the comments. The best part is APPLE USERS CAN ACTUALLY BE A PART of the firmware updates and have assurance in a better OS experience overtime. I’ve had my S6 for a year and I’ve only managed to have one firmware update that took 7 months to deliver. I can only give credit to android for the premium android devices such as my S6, until then the physicality of a device alone cannot make me shift in the near future. I want a solid experience, not a hollow one. 08/02/2016 Adarsh Reply Hi, Your comparison of iphone with S7 is not right because in case of iphone both hardware and software are developed by Apple and in case of S7 developer of hardware is Samsung and developer of software is Google. I use Nexus 5 phone, hardware and software both developed by Google and manufactured by LG and ipad Air2 by Apple. Both devices update periodically whenever updates are released and I am happy with both. 09/15/2016 Me Reply LOL stay laughably buthurt/beyond tasteless loser Fandroid X ) 03/02/2017 xxLoser123xx Reply Wow you know how to use a Thesaurus. 03/06/2017 Sally Fallis Reply Wow! I AM impressed! You know about the Thesaurus!! I didn’t think anyone under 50 ever heard of it anymore! 12/17/2015 Noah Reply This comment, as well as this article are laughable at best. Coming from a person who owns all major Apple products but frequently bounces back and forth in the smartphone department, I don’t see how any of these actually make the iPhone “better” than android. I would say the only point that is valid is the support Apple has from app developers. It’s pretty easy to see that apps on the iPhone can be “prettier” than apps on android with the extra animations, and quick gestures. However even that is relative, since iOS gives you security and “pretty animations” but gives of freedom and functionality in the process. I still can’t tell you which phone is better, as that all is personal preference and I really don’t care which phone is “better”. I just want a phone that does what I want it to do without too many hiccups (which is why I’ll never buy another Samsung device). For now, I’d say in terms of productivity, the iPhone is great if you are a person who needs iMessage, FaceTime, and the Apple ecosystem to feel comfortable doing work. While I believe most android phones will get work DONE. With the amount of third party apps available to you on the play store, multi window, Google now on tap, and other gestures. I have always felt an android is phone is more a workhorse while the iPhone is king of simplicity. 05/23/2016 Anthony Reply Congrats, you just wasted about 5-15 minutes of your time typing out this article because its not going to convince anyone.

So, he’s not being biased. http://www.gottabemobile.com/2016/05/26/android-vs-iphone-2016-android-better/ 11/10/2016 Pixleboy2 Just because he has another article doesn’t mean this one’s biased 01/30/2017 Selenia Thank you for that. This article and many commenters made me want to vomit thinking he was so biased and the sheep just followed along. I can give numerous reasons Android is a better OS, but that is not the point. However, some Android devices suck. Most of the detractors comments are true of stock Samsung devices. Samsung may be the most popular, but far from the best. They make pretty good hardware, but the software begs for rooting and custom ROMS. I am typing from a Nexus 6P, which is pure Android. Google does good with monthly updates, too. But I am using Pure Nexus, the best reason for owning a Nexus/Pixel device, with ElementalX kernel for out of this world stability, smoothness, flexibility, and battery life. Unless I use hotspot(tunneled over VPN), I only have to charge every 2 days under pretty heavy use. PN is actually updated more than Google’s stock and usually delivers security updates within a day of release, which is faster than Google often rolls it out to most users. 01/06/2016 Leo Keys Reply Why would someone else go with a product by Google, NVidia (I will come back to them), or Microsoft; over that “A…” Company (Repeat)? The reason people would use nVidia over the AMD (god I hate AMD’s Products) GPU’s found in Mac products? They want a more powerful GPU. Apple says that their “PC’s” are better and use top-notch products. Why don’t they use the GeForce GTX 980m in the MacBook Pro? Why don’t they use Quadro cards over FirePro cards? Because Apple doesn’t know anything about Graphics. As for iMac’s I have no clue why some use an i5. Apple products thermal throttle a lot. Android is secure with the right Antivirus programs. It is also much more free to do what ever you want. But, because your an iSheep, you can’t process facts that favor the other side of the grass. Guess your life must be happy, getting råpēd by Apple, every year and paying thousands on eye candy. Why use Google or Bing over Yahoo? Yahoo sucks, that’s why. Face the fact that Yahoo and other search engines are inferior to Google. Apple products are trash and are eye candy for white girls (Starbucks and that stuff). 01/06/2016 Pedro Coimbra Reply Now you have to bring the Nvidia/ATI war? What, the iphone/android isn’t enough for you? Dude AMD cards are equally powerful, no matter how much you “hate them”. Why Apple chose AMD? Maybe prices, power consumption, price/performance ratio, easier to adapt to their hardware, who knows? But a company such as Apple (you can write the complete name, it won’t bite you) so adept at optimization doesn’t make these decisions lightly, they HAVE a reason, one that you *don’t know*, but that’s irrelevant. About the i5, a reason for the apparent lower specs must be because of how streamlined and optimized the OS is, instead of being made to work with zillions of combinations of brands, boards, peripherals. So what you want in hardware to cope with the software, was made achieved with the fat-free software. «Android is secure with the right Antivirus programs», well I guess any system is secure with the right Antivirus programs, isn’t it? but never 100%. How about a system that doesn’t need antivirus, just a little inteligence from it’s user? Android safe… yes, keep dreaming, it’s not as the net isn’t filled with cases of security holes and breaches of android. If you reply to my I advise you right now to not bringing ATI/Nvidia stupid nerdish arguments or sheep mentality, about mobile platforms and geekinesses like that, because I simply don’t have the patience.

Also other things like sharing things and integration compared to Apple products only. Almost every line in this article is not right. 12/12/2016 Cjros Reply LOL, thank you for making me 100℅ sure that Android is way better than newest IOS. Your arguments are so poor and naive :). The only thing youve got right is the SD expansion, but it is not any issue at all :). Thank you, my hero :) 12/15/2016 Debapriyo Reply You are so dangerously biased towards Apple that some of your words make so sense and are outright stupid. I have no problems with you choosing an apple product but lol. You don’t use Google search engine? Then you are missing out. Their search engine is still the best and most reliable and miles ahead of other search engine options. Google Maps way better than Apple Maps. Every tiny feature Apple introduces in the new version of IOS, Google had it in android 2 years back. I myself love some Apple products and appreciate the high standards of quality they incorporate in their products but please don’t even compare Apple with Google. Apple just makes iphones, macbook and some fancy toys. Google makes much much more and is the spearhead of IT innovation today. Be a fanboy but don’t be an idiot. 03/22/2017 ComputerGeek Reply you’re weird 06/23/2015 Chris H Reply Some of these reasons for being better than Android phones are oxymoronic. An extended warranty and readily available Apple Stores suggest that the iPhone is prone to bugs and damage. I will stick with my G3 because I know if I drop it it won’t shatter and I won’t have to give more money to Apple either for a case and/or a screen fix. There is a reason there aren’t Android stores out there. Because their phones don’t nearly have as many issues in my opinion. Consider Chevrolet and Honda. The Honda will last and is just as nice if not nicer than the Chevy, which will not last nearly as long and will force loyal customers to buy yet another Chevy. 07/27/2016 eiendiaies your_ufo Reply I would love to hear your comment now about your G3. Android stores are not because android companies dont give a f.ck about costumers, they just improve SPECS SPECS AND SPECS but where is NO improving quality. Why for example iphone 12 megapixel camera can beat sony xperia 23 megapixel camera, why iphone 1500 mah battery last longer than lg 3000mah, why fingerprint on iphone works much better than samsungs? And whats a practical difference between 640p vs 2k smartphone screen? Damn the real sheeps dont understand what apple cares about costumers and they stay at same screen resolutions because they just dont need to improve screens, android companies just keep adding numbers on specs. But where is quality improvment? You say iphone works better because of lower resolution screens, but than why androids keep improving resolutions but forget about older android users? I am ex samsung and LG user, rubbish costumer services, if android die than i must wait couple weeks for replacment, if somethin happen with iphone i know where is apple store and dealing with them in same day. Price stays high for iphone for a real reason. Iphone is not about SPECS, its about quality in every aspect. 09/30/2016 Linked Devices Reply The issue with iPhones that I hated was that the only way you could fix any glitch that would inevitably crop up is by factory resetting the phone each and every time. It’s such an annoying and time consuming process having to set everything back up again. When I made the switch to Android I was really impressed by how stable and self contained it was. Whenever there was a glitch it was limited to that particular app and you could simply reinstall it and it’d be fixed. I’ve never encountered any systemwide issues such as the iPhone misc storage bug that would happen to me all the time with the 6s. Apple does a great job hiding all of its glitches by simply not providing any prompts. Apps just disappear when they crash. It’s terrible. I know a lot of people with the misc storage bug to this day and don’t know it. They just think they’re out of space all the time because they need a new phone.. 09/30/2016 Linked Devices Reply I lol’d at how much superior the author thought the lightning cable was because it was reversible. You have a fifty fifty chance at it if you do it blindly but most cables have a dimple on top to make sure you get it even time.

Some of these were acceptable reasons, but most were not. My wife is using an iPhone 6, and I have the Galaxy S6 edge. We both agree that my phone is far superior in terms of speed and screen resolution, but her camera, even being spec-deficient to my Android, seems as good as, or even better somehow. I like your point on the updates all rolling out at once, but almost every other “point” you made about iPhone being better boils down to one thing: lots of your friends have iPhones. That’s it. That’s the selling point, and the basis of this article. “iPhone apps look better.” – That’s completely relative. Lots of apps do look better, but they generally are paid apps that are free in the Play Store. “Works for all your devices” – So what? I thought this was a phone article. Android works with all your crap too. “No Carrier bundled apps” – I dont know how that’s a selling point, but okay, you win. Bloatware is an issue on android. “Sharing to other iPhones”/”Better resell” – Your friends all have them, so you should too. Then you can sell them to other friends who have older ones and make more money. Ridiculous. Yeah, you get a few more bucks for them, so that means you should have an inferior phone? Who buys a phone because of resale value? Preposterous. “Lightning cable is miles better” – My S6 charges from nothing to 40% in 10 minutes. iPhone can’t do that. I understand that the cable may be good, but “miles better” is a stretch. “Apple Stores” – So? I don’t even understand how this is a point in your article. Go to best buy, it’s the same crap. “Touch ID”/”Headphone controls” – Those both work flawlessly on a good number of high end android devices as well. “iMessage, Facetime, blah blah” / “Share apps easily” – All your friends have these, so you should too, or they’ll laugh at you. “Siri works better than Google Now” – Google Now isn’t Siri. That shouldn’t be a comparison. It’s not trying to be Siri. It’s a voice search, and that’s it. Siri works, but it doesnt work “better” than anything else, because there’s nothing to compare it to. If you like having Siri, good. “Notifications are better” – No, they’re not. Android’s notifications work exactly the same. Now don’t get me wrong, I’m not saying iPhone isn’t better, I’m just saying you haven’t proven that it is here in the slightest. Both OS’s are very well made, and the playing field is far more level than any avid IOS or Android user wants to admit. 07/30/2015 Helene Reply Excellent comment. I totally agree with you. 08/07/2015 Sam Reply DONT throw away your s6 edge… get an iphone but if you can use them interchangeably 07/15/2016 quenchybro Reply lol hi sam 10/09/2015 Palbo Reply I disagree. Bloatware is not really a problem on Android; any respectable company will only install commonly used and necessary apps like the Play Store and Gmail. If you are buying a phone that will leave your wallet intact (and still deliver better specs in every single measurable way than an iPhone 6, such as the lenovo k3 note) from a less known company which may allow bloatware, you can easily root the phone and uninstall it. I do agree with your other points, though! 05/27/2016 ZENCKPRI Reply Phinfankid you are completely right. I agree with everything you said. You are probably the only logical person who has commented so far. Also the iPhones storage is just a scam to keep people paying and buying more storage. Unfortunately the Samsung Galaxy s6 also removed the microsd slot, but luckily Samsung got it sh*t together with the Samsung s7, which in my opinion is the best phone. 07/12/2016 10beasts Reply You really explained the situation very well! Loved it. 07/09/2015 D Reply This article compares Apples to apples. Your references to Android are focused towards Samsung (you know the company that makes the screen, processor, RAM, and ROM in most Apple devices). Compared to a more vanilla Android experience, Apple blows. My $200 Zenfone 2 is better than any fruity phone at a third of the cost. With Apple, you pay more for less, but get a pointless logo. 07/10/2015 Scott Reply What about Apples different charger cords? Droids micro USB cords work with any other Android device. In fact, pretty much all phones but apple use it. They want you to need to buy new chargers more often. Apples are streamlined fads also, just like every product they’ve ever released. Yeah, cause being “cool” means getting the same more expensive products all the other rich kids got. 07/30/2015 Helene Reply I had both and I don’t agree with this article.

You can do a lot of stuff on Windows pcs while Mac struggles to do one stuff….At least it’s stable and easy to use through…But seriously it’s overpriced shit…You can get almost awesome gaming laptops for the price of a MacBook Air. In fact, iPhone is better than android….Because the mobile era is another thing, it’s called mobile for a reason. It should be easy to use and quick. That’s why Apple wins at this point…Come on get real men you wanna play GTA V on your mobile? No for sure. Apps are even better (which surprises me why it isn’t the same for a Mac vs Windows) iPhone’s are faster than most android phones….But if you compare it to stock original android phones, the iPhone still beats them but not as much as other android phones. Because unfourtantely Google didn’t know how to configure Linux properly but i bet you if it does…The iOS faster than android is a history….Linux is ultra-powerful and that’s why most of the world super computers use it…Because you can tweak it the way you like and you will get an extremely faster performance than Windows and Mac. But Google couldn’t handle it I guess….Even the Java language is much faster in terms of processing but I’m still surpsised why iOS apps are still faster….It’s just another replica of Nokia’s fault with Symbian (Nokia never built a stable Eco system for it until it’s near to death period, which led the CEO to get rid of Symbian because it takes years to built an eco system) 05/19/2016 PABLO Reply Right off the bat i can tell you are a little kid who just bought a samsung and is butt hurt you made the wrong choice, “struggles to do one stuff” he also pays great attention in class shown by how grammatically correct this is (as i was writing this I found this… “The iOS faster than android is a history” WHO TEACHES THIS KID I NEED TO COMPLAIN)! 08/04/2015 Robin Reply Poorly written article bringing in irrelevant points and downright false information. Take your “works great with all your devices” section for an example. I use an android phone and an apple computer, and the two devices are 100% compatible with no need for a “third-party application” or service. Completely untrue information in this section. Also I have texts and all the regular online messaging apps I use from both devices well synced. All data, photos, contacts, music, etc from my phone are stored in a cloud service and attainable through my mac computer and my (android) phone. Also your first section “iPhone Apps Are First and Better Looking” contradicts itself. 07/06/2016 Gretchen Alexander Reply My iPhones have NEVER worked great with my PC laptop. NEVER. And the people in the store aren’t much help either. I’ve wasted hours in there. So I don’t know who the person who wrote this article talked to, but my experience has been awful with compatibility between iPhone and PC. In fact, it’s the main reason I’ll never buy another iPhone. 08/10/2015 Malin Saming Reply Really? Here are 10 reasons you have apples for brains: Android is free, Google drive storage is FREE. 15 gig of files, unlimited photos! Androids voice recognition is WAY better, try a comparison, Siri is like a nagging wife who can’t get it right. Android phones have wireless charging! Android phones built in payment that works everywhere. Not at 3% of stores like Apple payment. Android phone MULTITASK, thats right you can run a dozen apps at the same time while talking. Android phones have sizable widgets, so you have live streaming info on your home screen. Android phones are available in endless formats, not like the communist way “everyone has the same”. Android phones PLAY ALL FILES, iphones only play Mp3’s from itunes etc etc pain in the Apple. Android phones have rapid charging, 10 min = 4 hours of use. Android phones are available with 2 days of battery. I could go on and on but your Apple brain will not listen anyways. You probably have a really nice typewriter that you show off the lack of it needing toner or electricity. There is a reason Android is about 82% of the market and Apple has fallen from 33 to about 12%… In fact the remaining iphone users I know all run Google everything on their iphone anyways, why not get the best hardware too. I look at everything I can and see things for how they are, then I buy the best I can find, if you do the same you will love your new Galaxy S6 8^ ) 12/13/2015 Pedro Coimbra Reply I tried, but stop reading after the «iphones only play Mp3’s from itunes etc etc pain in the Apple.» Just this BS of a sentence already has 2 lies in it.

And childish comparison . 09/16/2015 Srikanth Reply I can say something here because I own and use both iPhone 6 Plus and a Samusng Galaxy S6 edge equally everyday. So I think I am in a position to give a fair judgement …or at least decide what works better for me. I have changed over from iPhone as my default device to S6 edge and back to iPhone few times. But I find myself using iPhone 6 Plus more often than S6 Edge…because of these reasons 1. Smartphone is smart because of quality apps. I always found iOS apps looking neater, working smoother and more consistent compared to Android Apps. Just to quote an example…Adobe acrobat reader which i made default app to open PDF files….is not able to open files since last two days all of a sudden and reporting error. Everything is updated but still doesn’t work somehow. But works fine with iOS. 2. Screen of iPhone is marginally inferior to my S6 edge which is stunning. But I don’t hold them near my nose and try noticing pixels. From a practical point of view iPhone screen is absolutely fine. 3. In spite of inferior hardware specs on paper, I can’t deny iPhone user interface is more fluid and smooth. Thats what makes the experience more pleasant for me. 4. iPhone 6s is already launched…I am not upgrading. But know what? Last night iOS9 update was available to my phone. I have already updated to same. Isn’t that amazing? I can’t help comparing my Galaxy note 4, my near stock android Motorola droid turbo.. etc..which haven’t received even 5.1.1 Lollipop when Android Marshmallow is about to be launched in a month. Sad. This alone is enough for me to stick to iPhone as my default device. 5. I havent noticed parallels for some Apps in Android (Drafts, Soulver etc). Which I learnt to use often and liked. I am a fan of some automation apps like Tasker on android which doesnt have an iOS equivalent. But as of now my use of same is less. 6. I guess iOS is bit more secure compared to android against virus attacks and hacking. it IS something important to me in this era of mobile banking and when we keep so much data on Google drive and One Note etc. and hey…Google has made most of its apps available to iOS. I agree my S6 edge is superior in Camera department and pictures look very good. Also usage of widgets is better in android. But after using both OS since last 3-4 years, I am sticking with iPhone as my default and S6 edge for miscellany and photos. This is what works for me. I know others have other reasons to stick to any one OS. I have best of both worlds now but can’t help saying one is better than other at present. 12/02/2015 Zombieknight Productions Reply Updates are an invalid point, because the newest version of iOS isn’t as good as a 2 three year old version of Android 12/02/2015 Srikantha Krishna Reply I don’t agree with you there. Updates are important. They optimise the software, remove bugs and important to plug security issues. Of course Google releases them but only nexus customers get it. Other manufacturers don’t release it in time. Tell me now how many handsets are going to get Marshmallow and when???? 04/25/2016 Sally Fallis Reply So which is less complicated for the over-50 me who is good with words but not pictures? I had to ask a young person what all those little dots and waves, etc., meant on my Ipod Touch. I really miss words, but I realize I am alone in that. Is a Samsung any easier to navigate for (duhhh…) me? 07/11/2016 Iggy Z Reply If you are over 50 you should definitely stick with Apple 1. it is extremely easy to use 2. you can do many tasks without even doing anything, but simply telling your phone to wake you up at 5am, or to remind you to take your pills when you get home 3. you can change the text size and icon size to accommodate your eye-sight 4. you can ask any teenager to help you organize the icons into more intuitive way Microsoft Windows phones are rich on words, but while it would satisfy your need for everything being written – the phone will be difficult to use, and will still contain many icons. So, go with Apple, even an older 16GB model, will still be fully supported, and will work perfectly well, do not get 64GB version, you wont need all that memory. 07/16/2016 quenchybro Reply but apple is expensive 08/25/2016 ermm Reply with android it is much easier to use… you can tell your phone to set and alarm….you can change the text size 01/10/2017 Frank McConnell Android is an absurd ecosystem, the UI is very hard to even remember, iOS is better due to the simplicity of the UI. OP was right about iPhones being easy, I use one because android is hard to use. Maybe you should get an iPhone, it’s 5x faster than every android phone in the world and you’ll get a good one on eBay for like $200! Why do you think Google is better on iOS than on android. lel, Android is a joke OS and should be defunct! 10/15/2015 Andras Reply I´ve been an iPhone user for 2 years, recently I bought an Android phone to verify if really Android is superior… After 2 months of testing it, I sell the Android and bought an iPhone 6… This do not prove that iPhone is better, but for my needs, iPhone is totally superior… Android is good, everything is cheap but is not an stable OS… Yes you can have all personalize, but for what? I´m not a teenager anymore so whats the point to have all personalized and change it every week? By the way the output of the sound of the iPhone is really more superior than the output of any Android phone With an iPhone (in music business) is way better you can control lights, console really simple with iPhone and all tech for music is much more easy to sync and to handled on an iPhone… Music business in a MAC is much much easier I love iPhone and I would not change it anymore Like I said I´m not saying iPhone is better for everyone but for my needs yes it is 12/02/2015 Zombieknight Productions Reply Wow! You’re actually dumber than every other I sheep here. IPhone has good sound? Better than any Android? Hahahahahahaha! Have you even seen an HTC One phone? Best speakers and any phone! Ever. IPhone speaker is tinny garbage. The S6 even has the same placement, but sounds much better. Seriously, Google HTC One m8 or m9. Cm8 literally got the top phone of 2014, and everyone mention how good the speakers work. I also got first place cuz it was vastly superior to any iPhone. Better software, better design, better screen, etc 12/02/2015 Zombieknight Productions Reply And please specify what Android phone it was. Otherwise I’ll assume you’re lying because there are so many and you can’t name one. Or you got a cheaper old one. Android high end phones are very stable. Look it up. They’re way more stable than iOS 01/30/2017 Selenia Reply Signed, someone who has never used Viper4Android. Seriously, I can’t stomach the sound output of very many phones without it. Only a few Androids that have nice customized audio processing(like the LG V20) and no iPhones or Windows phones. Many of the rest of Androids can use this superior sound mod. I have a Nexus 6P with Pure Nexus and ElementalX kernel, which has nice front firing speakers, better than iPhones. V4A gives audio processing to match. Not available on iPhones or Windows Phones. 10/17/2015 Tushar Reply Why r u only talking about iphone 6plus,which is much costlier than androide same feature phones, there are some other iphones had launched by apple like iPhone5, 5s,5c i compare this phones whith 20000 rs android phones where battery of iphones so worst and camera and no memory slot, nevertheless this iphones have more cost than android phones. 10/19/2015 Lu Reply LOL you will not get confused using a LIGHTNING cable? are you kidding me????????? Does this mean that it is designed for dumb people who constantly flip the usb port? is this the main reason! why apple cant for some reason jussssssssssssssssst go with the flowwwwwwwwwwwwwww and use a normal USB port that makes it easier for all humans in the world to share chargers? Dude, i use both systems and i can point out one thing better that most people usually ignore, my Father is blind, he uses an iPhone because tbh the Voice-over mode for iPhone is the best ive seen and used so far.

You only choose an Iphone because every one else has an Iphone, if not you would of picked android and said Iphones suck, you also don’t even know how technology works bitch, so I would not be talking because there are far more android devices with better specs, and fyi i’m a kid obviously i’m not employed. 04/22/2016 Derp Reply Well then maybe you didnt know what a high end android phone is.. Poor you. 05/21/2016 Cowbladder Reply This post is what makes you look bad. 05/21/2016 Cowbladder Reply Also, aside from your arrogance making you look bad, you have got to be kidding about BlackBerry. I carried the Z10 now carry the Passport with BB10. I only have it because my company prefers BB’s security. But as far as fuctionality, it’s like working with bear skins and stone knives compared to iPhone or Android. The lack of apps and limited integration with other devices is stifling. That’s why I carry a separate personal phone. It’s also why BB is abandoning BB10 and switching to an Android platform. So are you going to cast off your somewhat acceptable friends who carry BlackBerry when their platform becomes Android? They better run out and get an iPhone when that happens so they can still be honored to be deemed worthy of your friendship. 07/11/2016 Iggy Z Reply 1. Android they switch to is FULLY custom and has all google services BLOCKED 2. This is the reason why companies are abandoning BlackBerry due to high maintenance costs and instead make private applications for iPhones which you can only download using a special code, a secure application within a secure platform, cheaper to maintain, more convenient for an employee to use. I completely agree with Bob, Androids are for 12 year olds and vagrants, the paper specs of Androids (factually and historically) are not an indicator of how they perform. And the fact that you think that you are smarter than a mass of hard working high ranking professionals, and that you need to show them all how “individual” you are by always “personalizing” your phone – just shows you are a fool and have nothing to do but to play with yourself on your phone like a kid, I bet you are one of those people who thinks wearing a watch is stupid and unmanly because you have a clock on your phone. 07/16/2016 quenchybro Reply ur insulting me cos im twelve so dont try piggy 01/30/2017 Selenia Reply You guys keep proving how Apple markets to ignorant people with a credit card. Reason many companies don’t use Android is because of the differences in OS customization from device to device and manufacturer to manufacturer. That can be a nightmare for testing in house apps. Nothing to do with security. My company uses Android tablets, but all the same kind. Only point you are right about is specs don’t reflect performance. Nexus/Pixel devices have good specs, not the best, but just try finding a faster Android or iPhone, for that matter. Why? Stock Android that hasn’t been bastardized. 01/17/2016 Grace Reply I use an iPhone, but custom built my own PC. I don’t like Android phones (had a Samsung galaxy for a year before switching back) but I also don’t like Apple computers. Honestly? What people buy is a matter of taste.

LOSER! 03/23/2016 sheel r shah Reply This article is so immature and stupid. Seriously, apps look better? You couldn’t even come up with a better reason?? I can literally break this article point by point. I would just like to say one thing though as a rebuttal, A NEXUS too receives the ota updates. An iPhone 64gb on contract costs almost the same as a carrier free nexus. I am a galaxy s7 user and the screen quality is maybe 2 generations over the iphone. As for the notifications, I prefer android’s iteration way more than apples. And about the cables, except the s7, all flagships use USB type c Samsung compensates with wireless charging. The battery life on a nexus or an s7 edge is way superior than the iPhone. And hangout video quality is as good as facetious. Also I like the fact that you don’t need to get out of hangouts to make a video call. In iphone you can usee iMessage but then to make a video call you need to get out and go to facetime. I get to play with manual controls on my camera which iphone doesn’t permit. I can literally go all day long about this. Just one actual good point about iphone you could have mentioned instead of the trash is that it has a stronger graphic processor that but by a small margin. 03/23/2016 sheel r shah Reply One more thing. You mentioned sharing. Do you feel ashamed that you cannot share media via Bluetooth?? The most basic mode of sharing? Talking about airdrop please use wifi direct once. Or nfc sharing. 03/28/2016 Stanata Reply Basically what this article is saying is: “use iPhone instead of Android – it’s more easy to use if you’re an idiot!”… lol There isn’t even one reason of those in the article that is 100% true… and almost all of them are complete crap! I mean come on – even monkey can plug MicroUSB and it is “a must” standard in Europa for instance anyway. Let alone that the future is in the wireless charging… And who today is NOT using Viber or WhatsApp? Who needs another messenger? I can continue, but don’t see point in that – the articles like this is obviously paid one. But sooner or later it will be clear at the end – the open environment will always be above the close one, because it is more close to the people!

It’s a Huawei, nice BIG screen I guess they call a Phablet. My younger son has an iPhone 6 plus. I decided to try an iPhone 5s just to see what it’s like. I have 30 days to check it out. So far, the ONLY thing see is the slow motion camera that’s cool and maybe some cuter emogies …I think they’re called. Otherwise….. I’m so far not impressed. My Huawei Android is 16g the iPhone 5s is 16g. The Huawei was I think $200 and the 5s $160 with its VERY tiny screen. My son has a 6 plus and 64g and that would cost me $650 or maybe it’s $650 for the6 plus 16g. Anyway…. Lots MORE MONEY. I guess if you have a lot of music… It’s better but I just have Lots of pictures. I like my sd card for these. I don’t know all the techy stuff and I don’t do Twitter or FaceTime or sharing pics except Facebook and text. I thought maybe some apps would be cooler but so far… I’m not impressed with the iPhone at all. Just my opinion. 04/12/2016 D Dawg Reply smoke weed everyday 07/16/2016 quenchybro Reply wtf!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 04/19/2016 J Corn Reply I knew this article was a joke when his very first reason is “Snapchat looks prettier on iPhone”.

The iOS Is custom built for and iPhone but the android softwares are not built for any particular device or hardware so optimisation is nog as good as in an Apple device. It not about specs the camera which shas more megapixels cannot alone deliver better pictures , a processor with more cores and greater clock speed can not alone give better performence until it utilises the most of it. So as Apple builds it products to its own requirements and deliver better products than android phones. An iPhone has better quality of internals as well as the body and feels premium than its competitors so that’s why an iPhone is an iPhone. 04/26/2016 De'Zsa Smith Reply Currently on my iPhone 6s+, sobbing as I type this. I’ve just got through longingly browsing Google’s Playstore, seeing all the recent updates of my favorite apps and hidden gems that the Apple Store just cannot compete with. Android has some seriously dedicated developers, and I’ve always admired them and even began looking into Android app development. That is… Until I switched over to iPhone several months ago after being a dedicated Android user. I will always be Team Android, hands down. I had a rooted Nexus 5, which means I’m all about customizability, design, testing, flexibility, and freedom. Then I decided I wanted to try something new—FaceTime, great camera, updated social apps like snapchat…you know, the basics. Biggest. Mistake. Ever. Switching over to Apple feels like I’m using a flip phone. Now I’m trying to decide if I should just switch back, or keep this iPhone as a means of communication (don’t know if I’m willing to give up FaceTime with family and friends) and have an Android for all the things I miss. 04/27/2016 weez Reply I just giggle at these articles. Ok Iphone kids, my phone has a webhost, tftp server, a windows deploy share with every iteration of windows going back to w2000, an SMB client, FTP client and host, Tftp server, wi-fi signal scanner, packet sniffer(nmap), a high frequency oscilloscope, a bluetooth HID remote that controls anything bluetooth, a linux/android debugger, point of sale and inventory tracking software(apple has it too but not complete on the phone), and at will I can change my MAC and spoof other phone’s IDs. My phone is a half decade old S2. So I guess if you plan on propping up a desk buy an Iphone, for everyone else that has work to do either grab a toolkit full of different things or just grab your android phone. 04/28/2016 Ken McDowell (@morpheusxp) Reply I don’t understand why it is all Android users say that iPhone users are sheep and that they use an iPhone because everyone else uses an iPhone. The iPhone has less than 20% market share world wide. That means less than 1 in 5 smartphone users have an iPhone. It seems to me going with the herd is more of an Android thing than an iOS thing. Just saying… 05/21/2016 Cowbladder Reply I think it is more because a lot of iPhone users seem cultic. I honestly think iPhone is a high quality product. But I really like high end Androids as well. However, I know people who use only Apple products and make little comments here and there about how inferior ALL Androids are. In that way I think they are like sheep because they have bought into this notion that their are no good Androids and they are operating on a higher plan than non-iPhone users. 05/23/2016 Anthony Reply Agreed. Probably because in the beginning people lined up outside of stores to get the latest and greatest iphone. It’s great hardware, but I can’t get used to a single button. Plus iphones seem to have a higher resale value. I don’t know. I do like how apple updates their devices in a timely manner and no bloatware, etc. I think Android is getting there, but unless it’s a nexus, updates are all over the place. I want the screen of a Samsung, build of an HTC with the battery life of my droid turbo, a headphone jack at the bottom of the phone instead of the top and I would be in heaven. Plus everyone I know say is that a Galaxy? So people in my area associate anything android as a Galaxy. Great marketing by Sammy, but perception becomes reality sometimes. 05/21/2016 Cowbladder Reply Meant to say plane, not plan. ☺ 01/30/2017 Selenia Reply Yup, it is about the Apple cult and the attitude that you are unwashed and not worthy if you use an Android. The attitude you must be broke, homeless, etc. My Android costs as much as a lower range current iPhone and can do way more. Here in the US, they have much greater market share, unfortunately. 04/28/2016 Joe Reply iphone has nothing on android. They have a good camera but that is about it. isheep all butthurt because android is taking over the world. 04/30/2016 qwertypop13 Reply So far all my favourite android apps were not available on ios, plus a lot of apps are a minimum of 10 cent cheaper on gpl than on apple app store. I also find it totally ridiculous that iphones need to be jailbroken to undergo any form of customization. Plus who wants fast updates at the expense of severe bugs, them slowing down stuff even more and getting a crappy operating system that hasnt changed since 5 years. Iphones are for people that only use their phones to txt and make calls. ps. I have a $20 alcatel phone and wouldnt ever trade it for an iphone. Buy what you like, but the points on this website are the worst I have ever seen. As far as I know you cant even use iphones to transfer files other than audio and photos to and from macs/pc’s. Apple phones are overpriced by like $500 dollars just because they have a flashy logo which they stole from the beatles. 05/05/2016 anthony Reply I love my android devices. Have I had problems. Yes. More than my wife’s iphone? Definitely. But I tinker with it a lot more than her iphone. I transfer files back and forth from a computer a lot easier with my device. Yes using third party apps but it’s still easier. I have all my music in google play, but use itunes (whole family uses ipods) so I just sync up that to google music and playlists as well. Each device has it’s pros and cons. I have used a rooted tablet to get pure android (didn’t like it) and have an ipad 2 which I love. It’s about choice and I like that we have it. Two points I agree with the author about: Timely updates and bloatware. HTC is bucking the trend to stay afloat by addressing this. Wireless charging is not worth it yet. I much prefer quick charging and new devices starting to roll out with usb-c. 05/07/2016 C Reply The article and ensuing comments are a joke. This is what The internet has come to now days. Let me be clear, I have years and years of experience with Android, IOS, Windows & Linux. I have every certification and more hours logged on to these then most of you. Now that we have established my far superior ability to actually comment here goes. First of all, the people on this blog and on others like it simply cannot help the fact that more people love iphone than android, period. So they make nasty little comments because they are frustrated that in reality they couldnt influence people in high school and they aren’t able to now. Second the android users who get angry at Apple users simply appear to only be mad because they don’t have an iphone them selves. Guys! Really! Let me be clear I have Windows and android and iOS. Iphone for the nomal every day user is PERFECT! Let them be! The android is perfect for more shady people who want to be power users an anarchists or some how feel like they are breaking the law or the rules. That is how android feels and that’s the base line of the os. I currently have an android because I can be one of those more shady people who like to go against the grain. But I don’t like android. Who the he’ll wants to root a phone? Who wants to spend hours on doing something? Not I! It takes me 10 minutes to jail break an Apple as and BAM I’m a super users with a linux based system and am sitting with a very powerful device! They all being said I have an android bc of expandable memory, an IR blaster, and a few other small features. When Apple steps up the game with these I will switch to Apple. Here is one reason why. What is a smart device? It is an item created to make your life as a human eaiser. Apple does that by leaps and bounds! The phone thinks of you like a loyal old dog and wants to do nothing more than serve your every whim. I can tell you the iphone holds up better, know why? Ever had to fix your mom or dads PC? And you think to your self wth are they doing with this thing. We never hear that issue out of iphone. So really is a beast just for that reason alone simply bc the general population can break them by doing stupid stuff. Now on to adress some other stupid comments for people who pretend they are SO smart. Windows is better than a Mac ios! Hum WRONG! Know why? Windows is a dos based crap system with a gui created for the average consumer to use a device. It’s not a damn computer it’s a pretty device to help you numb skulls use paint and word or get on the internet. What is my point now!! Oh yet MAC IOS is FAR superior at least for anyone who actually knows how to use Linux which by the way was and still is the base os on which all other smart software was and still is created. So you pretty little Windows fanboy users, please get a grip because until you stop drooling over your poster size photo of Bill gates and actually learn Linux you know nothing about computing. The really dumb person who commented about Honda’s vs Chevys! Hahaha seriously though? You also probably know nothing right? Honda and GM use the exact same part manufactures which in turn makes both cars CRAP! Research before you comment. Go get what ever phone you want and fanboys of each need to get a grip! 05/29/2016 C Reply Just to clarify a few things for the “people who pretend they re SO smart” Windows has been detached from DOS since windows 2000, It maintains compatibility by running an DOS virtual machine on the NT Kernel. Not all systems are based on Linux, Linux is based on Unix, Mac OS (and IOS) is largely based on BSD which is a variant of UNIX, The Windows Micro-kernel is also partly based on UNIX. For someone who has “years and years of experience with Android, IOS, Windows & Linux.” and “every certification and more hours logged on to these then most of you” you are spreading a lot of misinformation. I personally own all apple products, but have and still use the other platforms, They all have their advantages and downfalls. And although I use a Mac, Ipad and Iphone predominantly I still have moments of frustration when I miss windows, android and linux for one reason or another. 05/29/2016 CC Reply Not the same “C” as above btw 05/18/2016 Nikhil Bansal Reply Great Information.

Also, how can you say apple doesn’t come with bloatware? Have you tried removing the stocks app recently? What about file sharing, have you never heard of Android Beam? Or the fact almost every flagship has a fingerprint scanner now? This is the most poorly written, one sided piece of crap I’ve seen in a long time. How do you even have a job? P.s. I own a Nexus 6p for private use and iPhone 6s Plus for work and they’re pretty much equal in every way except for the Nexus having a better screen, free apps, faster charging and longer battery life. 07/16/2016 quenchybro Reply +1 lol 06/03/2016 alpharidley9098 Reply This article made me laugh pretty hard. I just love the reasons they give for the phone being better. Now 1 thing that is always MORE important than ALL of these is the actual phone. Also, those apps that come with the phone, it depends on what you are getting… Also, you do know apple is making a switch to MicroUSB right? Humph. Seems like just in this 1 paragraph I have already made better points than this article. Anyways, phone-wise, androids are almost always more powerful than an apple phone because of the fact that iPhones are never equip with a good core or a good amount of RAM. They slow down quite quickly and seem obsolete after a few months. Yes. Months. I have had my Moto G3 for awhile and it is still ultra fast and has no technical issues. 06/03/2016 Jens Lipponer Reply problem with iphones is that u need itunes etc.. and too many permissions. I like to just plug in and drag and drop files…. I don’t give a monkey’s behind whether apps look better or what not. let’s be honest, price wise the iphone is beaten every time. there is just no bang for buck. I laugh at people who buy these things for the show off appeal as I know they are getting ripped in a rather large way……… 06/08/2016 Mohamed Faizul Reply I used android for 7 years this is my first iphone 5s bought two years back From the day i bought this iphone till now regularly i m browsing in website that why iphone is better than android, why iphone is better than android,why iphone is better than android,why iphone is better than android but while using android i m much okay with everything…. iPhone is simple best for call ,messaging ,camera with instant speed though its two year old device … But not more than that In android its like sea u can do lot lot more than iphone but not as quality standard reliability fast easy as iphone . 06/09/2016 Ryan Reply Has anyone thought that maybe iPhone is more simple than Android simply because the staff aren’t smart enough to produce anything more complicated than simple? It seems obvious to me. At least Android screens don’t break when you drop the phone on carpet like iPhone’s do. There’s Applecare because the iPhones break like a window hit by a baseball because the whole phone is either thin aluminum or covered in glass (which is a hazard if the glass shards cut you and potentially make you bleed out). The aluminum iPhone’s are currently being made of bend in your pocket! They’ll need some high quality flexible glass and easily bent straight CPU (without anything on the inside being destroyed). By the way, for the vibration thing on Android you don’t have to input password or anything just click the power button and hold down the turn down volume button for a second or two and that’s it. 06/10/2016 Shaggy C Reply So your reasoning is half “It’s popular” and most the other half is comparing apple features to the bad features of a multitude of android phones?

So we may conclude lots of ……… 07/03/2016 Charlie Drac Reply I’m so late to this party, but I HAVE to comment.. I do not care what the name brand is. It could be called Android or robot or Apple or peaches or dog poo. All I care about is having a good phone that can do the most. Phones are expensive. I’m not buying a brand name. I’m looking to buy something that has everything it could possibly have if I’m going to spend that kind of money. You’re “reasons” show good things about IPhone, but are not “reasons” as to why it’s better. IPhones are good phones. People like IPhones because it’s a trend. It’s popular. That’s it. IPhones are not even close to androids. Be truthful. Androids are mini-computers. Literally. IPhone is not. You can do 100 more things with Android that you cannot do with IPhone. The That is the truth. And Apple products are a lot more expensive. Why would anyone pay more for a phone that gives you less? It boggles my mind. Android has variety. There are many, many phones, companies, styles to choose from. They even offer cheaper options that get the job done. They have an SD card slot. Why would anyone dish out $100’s more for more storage? That SD card is yours forever. For future phones or other devices. You can plug your phone into your computer and save(on the phone or SD card) anything (music, photo’s, video’s, contacts) and it’s yours. Without having to go through ITunes or anything else. Apple doesn’t own my stuff. I own it. And I can customize anything I own. There are IPhone stores for these little nick knacks. Transferring files, contacts, etc. It’s like going to a car dealership. One side has a variety of great cars. The other side has one car that is the most expensive. You see that all the other cars have a ton of features, options, colors to choose from, engines, horse power, cylinders, 2-door, 4-door, SUV’s etc. You ask “what’s so great about this lonely more expensive car tht only comes in one model and doesn’t have these other options?” The saleman replies with “Because it’s popular”. 07/06/2016 Gretchen Alexander Reply Yes, this! I agree 100%. 07/04/2016 Emanuel Reply No some of these staments are wrong android has a mode that will change you load out to make it simpler and look like apple cameras so much better its not even comparable iphones are rhe same every year android is some thing different like the edge and note you clearly didnt do your research i use to love iphone and thought it was the best and galaxy/android suchs but when i swiched ill never go back to an apple phone 07/05/2016 greentoe Reply http://gtoe.me/l/7A0q-A-04r 07/05/2016 Sam Smith Reply I just smell a whole lot of fanboying and bias. 07/06/2016 Gretchen Alexander Reply I’m astonished at some of the reasons listed why iPhone is supposedly better. I have two iPhones now, a 5 and a 6, that I can’t get my photos off of onto my PC laptop. I’ve gone into the Crapple store more than three times and still haven’t gotten them off. My idea of HELL is the Crapple store! I hate that place. There’s hardly room to stand and then you end up being sat at a table waiting with a bunch of other frustrated people waiting for a tech to help you. Of course this is after you make an appointment, or in my case last time, two appointments. I don’t see that as a plus at all because not only is going there a royal pain in the ass, but then they don’t even offer much help after several hours. My iPhone does not recognize as a drive when I plug it into my PC. It used to, and then stopped. I don’t want to have to use iTunes to transfer photos or music. I want to just plug it in and have it be a drive and copy whatever files I like back and forth. It does not work; and I’ve spent, literally, hours trying to get it to function that way. I also have a pretty complex DSLR camera and yet it is still easy as can be to transfer the photos from the memory card onto the computer. So why can’t a supposedly user-friendly phone just do the same thing? I seriously hate my iPhone 6 so much I wanted to shoot it, except I discovered it’s worth a good bit of money still so I’ll sell it on ebay. 07/09/2016 Joey Reply A lot of childish responses from android fans here. I gave the nexus 6p and try for 2 months after my old iPhone broke. Hardware was great, but I found on this android phone the app integration and interoperability to be no where near as good as an iPhone. Apple is just better when it comes to form and function. Buy an android if you want to tweak it forever and play in a sandbox, buy and iPhone if you need a productive phone. 07/10/2016 Colin Reply Your comment may not be childish but it is not correct. Comparable Android phones have far better form and function. Take the iPhone 6s plus verses a Note 5 or s7 Edge. The Apple is bigger and heavier yet packs has a smaller or same sized screen as the Samsung’s’ yet has far less features. Both these phones are far more productive, can multi-task properly, be fully customized and allow widgets on lock and home screens for speed, convenience and ease of use. The Note even includes a stylus or pencil. Great compact design, fully featured and greater functionality (Android) vs Heavy outdated bloated hardware with mid-range specs and limited functionality (IOS). Not to forget the limited compatibility of iPhones and lack of choice! 07/10/2016 Chris Reply There are facts, then there are opinions. 07/10/2016 Colin Reply This article is a disgrace, misleading at best. Most of the reasons are just not true or highly debatable. 07/12/2016 Benito Paul Reply congratulation all of u commented on weather iphone or android’s is the best In my point of view it may be any phone that is android or iphone. If we had a phone that should meet our requirements.Requirements means each and every people has different requirements in case of security,memory capacity and so and so. Hence apple or iphone buy any thing because all are vanity, “vanity of vanities” 07/14/2016 aileen Reply I’m someone who switched from android to ios but this article is utter bullshit. Yes, I love my iPhone and i’m so glad I switched by my samsung galaxy 4 was nothing but shit lately but these arguments in the article are dumb as hell. Lightning is better than micro usb? excuse me, what? my iphone takes ages to charge (iphone 6) whereas my s4 charged within an hour. i don’t see how that makes micro usb bad. but well my iphone battery lasts over a day and my old phone could have never. sharing location isn’t hard on android since almost everyone uses whatsapp bc imessage doesn’t exist on android and whatsapp has a location sharing option so that argument was dumb. yes, apps do look prettier on ios but i don’t see how only that would be a reason to switch?? this article clearly comes from someone who has only owned apple devices and doesn’t even know what they’re talking about, if you really want to prove a point you need to ask someone who has used BOTH of the things you’re trying to compare otverwise you’re just gonna embarass yourself. just saying. 07/20/2016 KappaPride Reply Why are you guys even arguing about this? 07/24/2016 George Reply The major advantage iOS has over Android is that Apple designs the phone and software. Whereas for Android (open source) other manufacturers have to play with it to get it to work and sometimes it’s not fluid. Take the Nexus phones for example…they just work like the iphones. No bloatware..nothing (like the iphone). Majority of my friends have iPhones and sometimes I wish I did too because of MMS (iMessage). I used both and I hate that i have to use itune for everything but it is what it is I guess. 07/24/2016 Landry Reply I’m 8 years experimented developer for iOs devices and I say that Apple releases so frequent updates because iOs is just a stone age OS to fool iOs users that Apple works seriously behind their products. It must run to compete Android OS. 07/27/2016 Aza Reply Best to have both. I have an Se and G4 best of both worlds 07/30/2016 Bob Reply So many things piss me off in this article but specifically stood out Notifications I have no idea with this author is saying he obviously hasn’t seen an android phone, they are exactly the same. Lightning vs. Micro-USB Micro-USB usually charges everything from headphones, to power banks, and of course cell phones. And multiple times to insert it is an absurd comment, after about a week you’ll probably memorize which way it goes, and how do you insert it incorrectly more than once. And USB type-C is just starting to come to the mainstream that’s why it’s not on everything. Storage Why do people even buy the 128 GB version, not to get apps but to download media like pictures, videos, music, etc. I agree with the statement about how sd cards are treated but there’s a much more simple solution, buy a larger storage option. Sharing purchased content Sign into the play store with the account that originally bought the content, install it, then sign out. Problem solved, and if anyone says “it’s more convenient” think about how often you might actually purchase something that costs actual money, I’ll bet it’s probably less than once a week. And it doesn’t take long to sign in and then back out 08/14/2016 Adso Rossi Reply I love iPhones. They always have nice designs and I like the simple interface. I have been itching to get an SE with its smaller dimensions (I like small phones). Money is not a problem to me but as much as I really want one I will stick with my Android device. Why? Cause the compatibility of iPhones to Windows pcs are real bad or none. You’d say “get a Mac” but I can’t: too many programs I need that unfortunately are only Windows-available. If this one single point of compatibility would be addressed, the iPhone becoming as compatible as Androids, I would get that iPhone SE in a heartbeat! 08/21/2016 nathanlittles plays minecraft Reply Who the hell needs iPhone I can name 100 reasons why Android is better but I’ll just name 20 1. Freedom 2. Apk 3. More sizes 4. More colours 5. Waterproof phones 6. Big and small tablets instead of the HUGE iPad 7. Clear cache option 8. For apps and also all the app store apps 9. No need for jailbreak but if you root you’re device will have no restrictions :D 10. Notification swipe 11. Google now 12. Google maps instead of the crappy apple maps 13. Multiple users feature 14. SD card storage So you don’t run out of storage easily like on the 16 gig iPhones (128GB or even 256GB) 15. Pattern unlock 16. There’s everything on Google play store even GPS spoofers to do the Pokémon go spoof in like 2 seconds 17. Unknown sources option 18. No need for an apple I’d all you need is a Google account which is way easier to set up and use 19. Get apps that are not out in your country easier (Pokémon go) 20. Android sounds better then apple 08/22/2016 Jim Reply This article made me so angry I must go punch a kitten. It’s an interesting psychological phenomenon, our emotional ties to brand loyalty. It’s as if the device we choose to use says something about who we are as people, and there is some ancient war of two types of people being waged through our genetics. Apple users are like Yankee fans, Android users are the goth kid outsiders. And the war rages on. 08/30/2016 Deleau Clément Reply Hi. Please kill yourself.

Like, the notifications. Android is wayyy better. You clear all at once or swipe. It combines like notifications that you can separate. It allows to interact with the notification and app without opening it and its just, way simpler and cleaner. 09/10/2016 Nigel Nderi Reply Let me settle this. Choose an iPhone if you are incompetent or are ok with a company controlling you’re phone completely. Choose an Android if you want to be able to enjoy the latest technologies and can competently manage it’s abilities without whining that it takes more than half a brain cell to use. 09/11/2016 Josh Mcduff Reply Just read all the comments and wow it’s all he said she said. I’ve had my Nexus 6p which btw one poster said it’s Google made nope huewei or whatever. Point is not the same, for about a year now and I’m now getting the iPhone 7. Are the specs pretty damn similar? Yes alot of the same features? Yes update often? Yes Nexus gets all the Android ones first like Apple. Price? Actually the 7 is less than the Nexus by about 150.00 CAD sooo that defeats the argument about price… Just saying. I love my Nexus but I’m open to changing. Ice bounced back and forth alot between Android and iOS can I say one is superior to the other? Absolutely not it all comes down to does it do what I want it to and can I afford it. 09/12/2016 Lee Reply All good and well people love free stuff but free stuff comes with a price of selling your info to the uncontrollable thirst party. iPhone also offer easy printing option than android you have to download something that will ask you to upgrade by paying just to use your printer no way! Also iPhone helps stop third party apps that try to use your phone making phone calls example if you are searching for nearest restaurant Google will show the call number to the same restaurant but when you try to call instead of calling direct the parasite apps like whatsaapp, text… And more they pop up asking you to use them making a call while they can’t function without your service they bug you each time taking away the time you spend trying to make a call. If you’re in a hurry and these app try to suggest you use it think how buggy this is. The same applies to text messages. 09/15/2016 Jada Reply Have u really owned an android?

Apple has had to recall their product so many times because people died from the battery exploding. And with Apple every 3rd phone they stop making updates for it. Android always has updates for their products. Plus Apple owes the government 37 billion dollars Android doesn’t. The iPhone 7 that is coming out is a total ripoff. They copied Samsung. Apple has never made a crack resistance screen and a waterproof phone. Samsung is simply better. 09/17/2016 Rob Doyle Reply I completely am for people having their own opinion, that being said I disagree with the title of this article. That being said without any bias coming into play here, some of the points that the author was trying to make aren’t true or aren’t completely true. 1. “Works with all your devices”… The real title should be works better with all of your APPLE devices. The examples in the article are all apple examples. The author obviously has no experience with android or windows. 2. “Faster Updates”…. Compared to what android device? You can’t just say that Iphones get updates faster and compare that to all android phones. The way that this section was written made it sounds like the day an update is release for Android, nine of there phones get it immediately like the iPhones… this just isn’t true. If you have a nexus you get updates as they are released (just like and iPhone) There is a bunch of other examples that just show the author has no experience with android devices, I’m just going to keep this short. People will choose what they think is best for them. My issue is with the author, not the opinion. All the argument were completely based on opinion and not facts. People are going to read this and take it all as fact, instead of doing research and finding the right device for them. 09/18/2016 Jonathan Masters Reply I have both an iPhone 5 and a Galaxy S7. While there are some advantages to the iPhone, there are several reasons why I just can’t make a permanent switch. First, no home screen widgets (like my calendar and agenda). Sure, you can add something like that to the notifications screen, but that involve swiping, as opposed to right on the home screen. Second, it’s so difficult — even annoying — trying to organize files on the iPhone. On an Android, it operates exactly like a computer should (and our phones really are computers these days), with folders, subfolders, etc., so you can just copy the files to where you want them for later use. You can’t do that on an iPhone, where all of your files go to some mysterious and deep “collection” on the phone. If Apple were to add those two features, then I’d happily switch away from Android. 09/21/2016 de Coulon Thierry Reply I wanted to try an iPhone, so I got an old one. I could simply not install anything because everything on the AppStore has moved to iOS > 7. I could not bring a single file to the phone. All it would do is sync with iTunes on my Mac, but there is nothing to sync because I don’t use this Mac for everyday life. The iPhone I got did not have any smart way to save battery. The iPhone I got could not play any of my music because a) I could not upload it and b) I could not install anything that would play ogg files. The iPhone I got was heavier, thicker and less good looking than my current Sony. So OK it was an old iPhone, but 90% of what I say would be true for the latest iPhone, and at what price! If you live in the Apple world, then an iPhone is probably the logical choice. I live in the Linux world and now I know I’ll never take another look at an iPhone. 09/24/2016 Jim Washko Reply Worldwide stats – Android users 82% vs IOS users 18% There’s not enough votes to even tilt the scale towards IOS being better. Being as the story indicates Android phones are only good for 2 years that makes them more expensive. How can IOS users explain why 82% of the market would rather pay more for less?, if that were in fact true. Iphone offers less control, poor resoluion, no expandable memory and not all phones can share the same apps. Android offers all of it as well as compatible with Windows whcih is currently at 80% of the market share. This is like comparing the Yugo to Prius. Sure the Yugo is cheaper at first, but after a year of so, not so much. Iphone resale is more, but that will drop due to fewer and fewer users as they get tired of the box of crayons with only black and white as an option. when they can get the box of 64 and a sharpener 09/24/2016 Capi Reply Is this all a big joke? You keep saying “iPhone is better than Android” about ten times in the article, like a mantra we have to learn and assimilate, Am I the only one who noticed this? I have and iPad, and iMac and I used iPhone (4, 4s and 5) I am familiar with both iOS and OSX but actually I have an Android and installed Windows 10 on my iMac. OSX is a good system if you like simple and easy interfaces, I don’t really have any problem with it, is a really good system once you learn to do things that are diferent with Windows, like formating drives with Disk Utility. (And if we forget how difficult could be for some people to use drive formats like NTFS in a Mac) But iOS, thats another story, Apple manufactures iPhone and developes a OS which works perfectly with that device, which, supposedly, makes it safer. There ends all iOS and iPhone REAL advantages. There are a lot of reason to say Android is better than Android, but the main reason is that you can freely add and delete files from it. I connect my Android to my computer, I press “Windows key” + “E” and immediately I see all my drives and my Android device there, and I can drag or delete files from it. But when I connect an iPhone I have sync up files with iTunes. Why the hell people think synchronization is good? For example, I spent one week adding all my music from CDs to my iTunes library, then I synced my iPhone and… voilá, my music was there. Then my computer died, and my music adquired during years with my money was completely lost, just because I didn’t buy it to Apple. But hey, music was still on my iphone, but NO, I need a third party program, which costs money or could be a malware, just to upload my songs again to a new computer. (Of course I have all my CDs, but thats a week lost) Im simply asking you to do like me if you can, just try everything, because if I read this article (iPhone is better, iPhone is better, iPhone is better…) I have the feeling that not everyone, but many people conform with iPhone. Just for popularity, for Apple fanaticism, or just because a website is telling you to buy it with superliminal advertising. 09/26/2016 wgallagher142 Reply I actually find that android apps have become much prettier and definitely more modern than iPhone apps at this point.

I have been a heavy android user till date until yesterday when I bought iPhone 7 plus. I own an iPad since two years. I am happy with my iPad which I use mainly for games and some handwriting. Yes I was annoyed from android. I owned s3. It had, due to some reason, a built in issue which I only realized after warranty finished. My faulty s3 obliged me to hate Samsung and android. Then I bought note 4. It solved all my problems I faced on s3. But still there were some things I did not feel good about. Now after purchasing iPhone 7plus 128 GB I understand the power of google. The three apps Google search, google maps and google drive are enough reason to close down iPhone factory from the face of earth. 10/10/2016 BM Reply Thinking to upgrade from s5. Thought for iPhone 7. But it can not do even 5 % work compared to android. My andrioid mobile automatically silents itself when I enter meetings or office. Automatic meeting mode when meeting is scheduled (only beeps) I can give my mobile to anyone to see coz I have app specific fingerprint. Only sensitive apps are protected. All other is open. These are not possible with apple except jailbreak. These are just samples. I can write journal what android can do. Speed is not important with a Ibrick which can not do anything smart. I’m not a fan of apple or Samsung. I want my work to be done and my pocket secretary to work according to my requirements. 10/10/2016 Charles Alden Reply 15 reasons why Android is better. Reason number one, you have an actual file system. Anyone who has dealt with iOS horrendous file management paradigm appreciates the ease as at which files are accessible in Android. You simply click on Open, navigate to where your files are stored, select, done. There is also never any reason to use the Share function except when sharing data with the internet. Number 2, multitasking, iOS’s multitasking absolutely sucks, especially when you compare it to Android. Example, I can stream a film to my TV wirelessly, while compiling an application via a remote terminal, while downloading a 40GB file directly to my NAS drive which is mounted as a local folder, while I convert a media file to .mp4, while I play N64, 007 Goldfinger using a replica N64 USB game controller. I’m able to select my own default apps, so when I download a file and click open, the app that I normally use for that extension opens up automatically. I have a global search function, which is one of the worst things about iOS, how do you find files. That was rhetoric, you can’t, it’s basically hunt and peck. I can customize voice commands, this is perhaps one of the coolest things about about Android. I have around 250 custom voice commands, mostly for searching files. Such as, “show me all file [file extension] created on [date]. Even photos, show me all photos from [city] on [particular date/month, years], even for a particular person , “show me all photos for [name] on [particular date/month, year]” External display support, when am connect my phone to a monitor not only is the resolution fully supported but so is the aspect ratio. Mouse support, while connected to a monitor I can use a mouse and a keyboard. Even when not connected to a phone, having access to a mouse is an absolute must when using a tablet as a laptop. USB peripheral support, so besides mouse support, my phone supports a TB external HD, HP All-In-One printer in which the scanner even works, USB replica game controllers in which a have one for the N64, SNES, Sega and PlayStation. Better overall specs, I have a 2K AMOLED display, 6GB of RAM, USB C, SD Card reader, HDMI out support, etc. I can use a custom desktop LDPI, I changed my LDPI to 380 which is the LDPI that activates tablet mode, which means all of my apps are a lot more powerful than the normal phone UI ones. I can customize my entire system to what I want it to be, give it personality, iOS users have been using the same system UI for the last 9 years. There is absolutely nothing I can’t customize. Inner app communication is a lot better, since iOS has a Walled off prison, or so called Walled Garden, apps communicate via API’s, which is the root of everything wrong within iOS. Anyway as stated above, I don’t have to use some half assed sharing function which creates a copy of the file your sharing every time you use it to open up my files within multiple apps, I simply click on Open. I can even open up the same file within multiple apps at the same time. I never, ever have to create more than one file, I just use the original file, always. I can use Linux under a Chroot, meaning I have a full Debian server running under my phone. Why would you want this, well first of all I have CLI applications like; Python, Perl, PHP, MySQL, Apache, etc. I have all of my favorite Linux GUI applications installed like; Dia, Inkscape, Gimp, BlueFish, etc. I can use my phone as a desktop computer, this one might sound weird but not only is it possible, it works incredibly well. Especially when my phone has 6GB of RAM and a Qualcomm 821. Like I said above I have all of my favorite Linux GUI applications installed in which a bring them up using a xterminal, when I’m at work I have access to about a hundred different Windows applications via a Citrix client which works fantastically. All of my applications including the ndroid ones are opened up in individual windows, so none of that dual app view non-sense. In which in iOS less than 0.5% out of a million plus apps actually support. I have access to widgets, they might not interest you but they are extremely handy. I can use wireless chargers. I can use custom ROMs, even completely different OS’s like Ubuntu Touch, SailFish, etc. I will never, ever not be able to run the latest version of Android. When a manufacturer stops updating their phone, no problem, I just install a custom ROM and they work fantastically. My phone is a computer, a real powerhouse, a real smartphone. Every time I use an iPhone I absolutely hate the experience. I mean even to type a post like this I would have to use a text editor as I would be afraid to loose all of my work as anytime you switch to another app, Safari just resets. It has happened to me numerous times, it’s why sites have started saving drafts, not for the Android users but iOS users. Though what bothers me the most is the lack of multitasking, yes, sure, there are a few apps that can run in the background but they are far and few and none of them are the ones that I need or want to use. Than there is the file system or I should say lack of, dealing with files IOS is simply a complete nightmare. Anytime someone at the office who uses an iPhone gets sassy with me about having an Android phone I simply ask them to show me their user directory, what, you can’t mount it, why not, your phone is so great. Not only do I have my remote server directly mounted as a local directory on my phone but my workstation and all of my cloud services as well, all accessible within any app installed. Again, my phone is also my desktop computer and why not, it’s not only powerful enough but more than capable. I couldn’t believe how horrible the external display support was on my iPad Pro, which I recently replaced with a Lenovo YogaBook, best decision I ever made. Talk about a complete makeover on how I work, I’m actually productive now. I can create detailed reports, all in the background and automatically, I have access to a scripting language, automation, multi-user support with OpenID to access my firms internal network, a real Office suite, MS Office for iOS was a complete joke, there isn’t even a import feature, scripting language, nope, database support, nope, by the way, I have the Android version. Which opens up every app under their own window, iOS’s dual app support on the iPad Pro was a joke, hardly anything supports it and that drag and drop feature, only apps designed by the same developer can use it, so MS Word to MS Excel yes, MS Word to Apple photos, no, useless. Yes, my post is huge, but this authors best 15 reasons why the iPhone is a joke. Almost everything listed I have on either my Yoga Book or new Xiaomi Mi 5s Plus or don’t need it as it’s a waste. In fact 90% of the so called new features in iOS 10 are useless. I held on to my iPad Pro thinking iOS 10 would be a game changer, not only was it not, but there wasn’t a single feature that improved my experience. Apple keeps skipping over every feature that we actually want, need. If your happy with multitasking, file management, the fact that you can’t select your own default apps, lack of customizations, horrible external display support, lack of USB C, limited NFC, horrible USB peripheral support, especially mouse support. Horrible inner app communication including the Sharing function in which took Apple 8 years to even release that crap, ugh, the list just goes on and on and …………. 10/11/2016 Gigi Reply This is one of the most biased articles I have ever read on complementing Apple. I am an adult, I don’t need Apple to limit what I can do with my phone and what I can share and who I can share with. I have used Iphone before and it surely not my cup of tea. 10/12/2016 Emma squire Reply Okay Listen what I think is that you have written an article telling the blank truth of your mind. But you see I have an iPhone 6s,iPod 5,MacBook air, MacBook Pro, Samsung TV with built in smart tv, Samsung galaxy tablet pro and I don’t mind Samsung to be truthful. Also I find that Apple is more easier to use but harder to switch from an iOS device to an LGphone. Emma squire, 11y/o from Aus. 10/14/2016 Babble Reply Let’s face it… I use an android lollipop but after comparing and visualizing the specifications.. One can truly say that iPhone is way more better than android. ..though we need to invest some bucks unlike android phones. 😀 10/14/2016 Huen Reply iOS is superior to Android. I was suckered in buying 2 android devices the samsung galaxy s3 and the nexus 4. I gave it a try because my friends raved about android. They are smart people who generally have great advice and knowledge on technology. So I said I’ll give it a shot because they have good judgement. However I found out that their judgement were out of biased hatred toward apple. Android devices: 1. on paper they have more ram, sometimes quicker cpu clock speed, higher resolution etc. however real life performance tests apple out scores android devices, just check geek bench and speed tests. As for higher resolution our eyes dont even detect the larger resolutions. 2. I found out the hard way, downloaded apps that just didnt work for my device. Google needs to improve this I dont know if they are better now but man they need to detect the hardware your using and tell you ahead of time before you download and install an app that its compatible with your device! 3. customizations my butt!! Its a great idea so called if all your launchers actually look good! haha I tried all these loaders for my s3 and they were all ugly. Just go with apple, its like saying would you hire great designers for your house and you would just let them have their way in designing the house for you or would you want to design it yourself? doesnt make sense look at xiaomi great example they just copy everything apple does and it looks great. Dont hire cheap designers to design the way your phone looks and works. 4. OS – android’s solution to everything is “oh just download this app to make it work or oh just kill this task or reduce brightness or this or that” why?! If I’m paying 1k for a phone why does it not just work? Why must I non stop have to tweak things on my phone to get save battery or make things work? For instance for whatsapp there was no function built into the app that when I want to send a larger video than that of the given limit on a video it just rejects it. On iOS whatsapp gives you a little function that u can just cut the video into segments and send them in separate messages? This sounds like it can be something that is on the app level. I dont know but as for end user experience its just not convenient you need to download another app that will cut videos in segments for you this is retarded. 5. battery life just sucks on android – and my friend is all like well it works for me…well that’s because he had to buy a new battery that was double the size and totally threw out the idea of having a sleek thin phone. Theres on and on the list goes android and samsung devices are not superior devices. The features samsung lovers speak of are just gimmicks. Keyboards, widgets, notifications honestly who cares? Especially when widgets just take down performance on your phone? I just dont see any benefits on android especially the argument went something like this: “oh android phones are cheaper for superior hardware” Like I said hardware maybe superior on PAPER but in real life benchmarks iphones outshine samsung and htc and other top tier android devices. By the way prices are not cheaper anymore so android fanboys have no actual argument. Like I said I tried android and they are not superior phones both hardware and software. Aesthetically Android phones are ugly. You now pay a premium price on sub premium products, and they explode. lol 10/20/2016 Jamezz_ Reply Sure. A Samsung or LG’s phone software is ugly. But stock android?! Android 6.0 stock? It’s an extraordinary interface with origami-style apps. The geometry with the shadows and vibrant colors is beautiful. The app drawer is simple, and you can put the apps you use on your home screen. Android’s advantage is software. iSheep are just too autistic to use it. 10/16/2016 Cmi Reply I have both! I have an iPhone for work and I have an Android for my personal use, in my opinion the phone is shit and could not compare to the Android in any area,i f it were up to me I would NEVER own an iPhone. Anybody who argues this point has never used them side by side. No comparison.anybody who stands in line for the new iPhone is absolutely getting the shaft and not even getting the best product , it’s laughable! 10/18/2016 George Brite Reply Great article. Over the years I’ve had both. Even a couple of Macs. I use PC’s now because I like being able to work on them and build my own. For the average user the I Phone is a better choice. They are simple and work well. Here’s the big negatives for me: The hardware and software are proprietary. In fact the phones are sealed. You can’t install an extended battery. No SD slot. No root access. Comparable Android phones cost a lot less. The Android phones natively work with Google Apps. We use our phones in the business. If I were a casual user it wouldn’t matter if it were a Trac Phone or an I Phone. We use the Google phones and Motorola phones. They run pure Android without all the carrier bloatware. I like to say Apple invented the smartphone, but Google perfected it. It’s like the choice between a toaster oven and a microwave or a full commercial kitchen. Most people will get along fine with the toaster and microwave. They don’t need a commercial kitchen. But, what if you could get the full commercial kitchen for the same price as the toaster and microwave? Everyone has an opinion about which is better. But trust me when I say this isn’t a choice between chocolate and vanilla. There are very distinct differences between the Android and Apple phones. 10/21/2016 ZinicHD Reply Wtf, apps never ever releases on iOS first. It always releases on android first. Also app updates releases on android first, so that’s kind of bullshit what you are saying. The only thing iOS beats android in is security and stability. Also you can get virus scanners on android, so that thing doesn’t matter. And one thing more, who ever uses FaceTime or iMessage, when we have messenger, Skype ect… And that point when you said that iOS stock apps was the stupidest crap I have ever heard. First of all it was a shit point, what are you gonna need the looks for? Second is that not everyone thinks it look better, so keep that mind. I am a iOS user and I am so disappointed that you can’t even customize the most of the things. I have to admit that the design of iOS is pretty nice, but you get quick tired of it. That’s why I jailbreaked my device to get the ability to customize it more professionally. But I don’t compare a android device and a jailbroken device, because jailbreaking is not something that comes with Apple. iOS is also very expensive compared to android devices. And checking storage on android is way more organized than iOS, so I don’t know where you get that idea that checking storage on iOS is better. 10/22/2016 Bent Vanwijnsberghe Reply the lightning port part is bs i have an iphone (looking for a new phone android) and there are around me on my desk already 3 micro usb and 1 lightning port witch costs around 40 bucks for a new one 10/25/2016 Selenia Reply Terrible article by an obvious fanboy. You are listing many things, like lack of carrier or manufacturer bloatware, reversible charging plug, seamless sharing, etc and saying they are exclusive to Apple. Try Googling USB-C, the current standard on any higher range Android, some still cheaper than an iDevice. Try a Nexus, or as of this year, Pixel phone. No bloat, Android as Google intended it. That would be a more fair comparison as those are at least close in the chain to Google, like an iPhone is to Apple. That is, instead of being made by some company who may not even care how it represents Android, build quality, and other important things, instead of pure profit(not say all non Nexus/Pixel phones are bad by any means, but some do give Android a bad name with poor specs and modified/outdated versions of Android). Seamless sharing? Ever hear of WiFi Direct, Bluetooth, or NFC? NFC is the simplest. Just hit share and tap. All but the cheapest Androids have that these days. Anyways, I am convinced you have never used a decent Android, ever. Certainly not one from Google themselves. I will leave you to tend to your iFlock. 10/30/2016 MzJens Reply For android, I think google products like nexus & pixel are much better than samsung. However, I noticed a lot of crappy apps available on google play that doesn’t work. Some apps require root access which only advance users should do. Android interface is not as intuitive as iOS. Some android apps hang. I’ve never had ios apps hang on me 11/10/2016 Pixleboy2 Reply “You have to try multiple attempts before putting the charger in at the right angle” 1. If you do it in a lit environment you will get it in first try because the micro USB shape is easy to see 2. If you are in the dark: And have an official Samsung charger – there will be a “bumps letting you know which way to put it and the only thing that can go wrong is you missing the port, which is possible on iPhone too. And have any old micro USB – there are two, normal, ways to insert it horizontally upside down and horizontally the correct way both 180 degree angles so please don’t exaggerate it. Finally Samsung cares about you that’s why they use micro USB. This may seem weird but basically to legally make a lightning USB cable you need a licence from Apple and Apple only have their own unique charger to earn more profit, that’s why apple chargers are always more expensive, because they are sold by Apple or the retailer needs to make his money back from the licence fare. P.S. Samsung devices come with a 1 year warranty for free and because it’s Samsung you can get cheaper insurance than their one (yes they have one) P.P.S. Sharing has always been easier on android to anything because you could share with a variety of options such as Bluetooth, NFC, messaging app, other third party apps, S share (Samsung own “air drop” that came out in Android version 4.1.3 BI7 – before Ios 7 Also the settings icon is useful, it’s like apple not making the send button on messages 3d touch to send so you don’t accidently press it, sure sometimes you send half written messages but it is more convenient and normal to have it to a single normal touch. And there is a difference between apps looking better and having more features on Apple which are usually hardware based, I just brought this up because no matter who you ask if you compare a Samsung phone with its equivalent iPhone generation, Samsung phones ALWAYS have better displays and MOSTLY have better cameras. Samsung phones are also very comfortable, for example I am writing this on a Samsung galaxy s7 edge There is a setting that allows the micro sd card to be added as side by side storage Finally Samsung has always had earphone controls so either I read it wrong that you said these are things we will miss very much or you are really confused 11/12/2016 Tetsuokenpachi Reply Each and every single of these are false. Android is actually better in every single of these areas. From the first to the last one. Worse yet, many of these points are actually some of the very reasons why idevices absolutely suck. 11/16/2016 Billy Sastard Reply apple is crap, these idiots make their products so expensive, but android is cheaper and has alot of awesome features.android is also WAY more customisable, with out necessarily rooting your device.And if you do, you can do almost anything from installing apps to changing your software. 11/16/2016 Calculadora Gestacional Reply I think both of them are just great! 11/16/2016 Caleb Reply The update can still download on older Apple products, because I have a IPad 2 that came out in 2011 and it still receives all of the latest updates. It is running IOS 10 right now. 11/16/2016 saurabh Reply Been an exclusive apple lover for 7 years now. But just bought an edge 7. Was amazed to see how much progress android has made and makes my iphone look so limited. I am aware that android tends to slow down over time but that is yet to happen to me. For now the openness of android is amazing as it is giving me a computer like experience while iOS still strictly behaves like a mobile device only. Classic hurt points being in iphone /iOS being No expandable memory No dual sim version (i travel internationally and need this frequently) Unable to use lastpass like apps the same way as in android (and keychain is BS, BTW) Simple things like themes unavailable Very less system wide control Very limited customisation I can go on but i think unless my expensive edge can give me same performance as now for ATLEAST 2 years, i’ll eat my words back But, the 15 points mentioned here are almost all very unconvincing. 11/17/2016 Philip Reply Apple are just simple phones no really fancy stuff I have had two Android phone I love their features but not their battery life which is crappie I have had two Apple iPods and two iPhone they were the 4 32 GB & 5s 64 GB now on Android your apps get updated every 3 months on Apple sometimes twice a week IOS updates are twice month at least I bought my iPhone 5s 64 GB which started with iOS 7 in 2014 now it got iOS 10.1.1 it seems the IOS are getting worse not better it freezes crashes most apps lot of the app you can’t even post two year let alone one day old photo I can get on my Samsung Galaxy S3 with 3 year old photos on it and post photos off it to any app only reason I like the small iPhones I can collect lot photos that way I can post to my apps like now I got over 106K photos on my 5s 64 GB which you can’t do with big phones only problems I got with iPhones are updates on apps and IOS’S like this month iOS 10.2 supposedly be coming out it seems the new IOS’s don’t really fixing any problems you get on your iPhone it just give you different problems while you still have the same old problems you also got figure Apple iPhones are about 3 years behind Android phones on new ideals 11/18/2016 Nick Reply Apple!?

From the moment you boot up ios, there are restrictions to what you can do with your phone. Can you flash IOS9 to iphone4s? Guess what, my old galaxy s2 is already running marshmallow like a charm and i think both of them were released in the same year. and i am in the process of flashing Latest nougat 7.1 cyanogenmod version on my s6 edge. You are writing about malware crap which is misleading. New android versions since lollipop allow users to modify app permissions but i think you are so caught up in app constrained ecosystem, you didn’t noticed. IOS isn’t secure anymore as we thought it was. Su vulnerability has already been fixed and there is no more stagefright bug in android. And you obviously have no idea about the difference between android based phones and android phones. Most of the Phones from samsung, htc, sony etc run Custom Android based OS, They are actually custom build port of android, not real android phones, so obviously there will be some issues too if you try to port IOS on samsung. A high end smartphone can go head to head with iphone in each and every aspect. My s6 edge is not even a tad slower than iphone 6, in fact, it performs even better. The slowdown overtime can be experience on low end smartphone. Obviously the one writing this comment has no idea about fstrim. Stop posting such nonsense crap in order to get traffic to your website. 11/25/2016 ashford Reply I have never once had a problem with android phones, but decided to switch it up as IPhones are the ‘in thing’ It was okay for a few months, but soon started having plenty of issues with speed, memory and doing basic things. I decided to upgrade it to the 7, which turned out to be just as bad. For the price, they should be giving people something amazing, not mediocrity! P.S. How much did they apple pay you for such a bad article. 12/03/2016 Brandon McLean Reply You didn’t mention how Apple has a much smaller battery, late software updates, unneeded restrictions, is insanely overpriced, and most of all, Apples processor specs come in at a fraction of what Androids of the same price have, AKA 1.6 GHZ (Apple iPhones) vs 2.4 GHZ (ASUS, Galaxy S7, OnePlus all running Android), 2 GB of RAM (Apple) vs 4 GB of RAM (Android). Android is by far the superior technology. Your only argument is that Android uses Google’s superior sharing system, rather than their own like Apple does. 12/14/2016 Keith Llewellyn Reply For me, it’s all about security, and Apple has the best. Also, if you buy an iPhone you get updates and support for a couple of years more than Google provides for it’s own Nexus or Pixel phones. Two years worth of updates for the OS and Three years for security updates FROM THE DATE OF FIRST INTRODUCTION is totally inadequate. It means that you have to buy a new google phone from the date it is first available in order to really benefit from the updates. 12/27/2016 Apple Marketing Machine Reply Let’s compare the “core” features of a new iphone to a 2 year old android phone: iphone 7 plus – Released 2016, September Samsung Galaxy Note 4 – Released 2014, October iphone 7 plus – 1080 x 1920 pixels (~401 ppi pixel density) Samsung Galaxy Note 4 – 1440 x 2560 pixels (~518 ppi pixel density) iphone 7 plus – Quad-core 2.23 GHz Samsung Galaxy Note 4 – Quad-core 2.7 GHz iphone 7 plus – 12 MP camera Samsung Galaxy Note 4 – 16 MP camera iphone 7 plus – Non-removable Li-Ion 2900 mAh battery Samsung Galaxy Note 4 – Removable Li-Ion 3220 mAh battery okay…you can have your “better looking apps”. 12/28/2016 MACKabiVIPer42 Reply Yes Android phones are better everything wise but iPhone battery is better last as long as up to 3 to 4 years Samsung last up to 6 months I know had S3 and HTC 1 still got S3 3rd battery it’s just iPod on second iPhone first one was iPhone 4 32 GB lasted 4 years got iPhone 5s 64 GB it’s over 2 yrs old but don’t use for taking photos just for collecting photos which small iPhone can collect up too 100K photos like my iPhone 5s I’m not SELFIE PERSON where I got take photo of my self in every window mirror and bathroom I love stealing other people photos like Anime ladies in bikinis to post on my other apps even Animals if they are cute enough yes Apple do make there apps crappie and there IOS’s also which crashes and freezes a lot then half time you can’t post photos or articles from your e-mail too the apps but I take Apple for small phone over android big phone 03/06/2017 iAlex Reply More pixels require more energy and chip performance.

This list is pure “i don’t like it so that means android is bad” and “its apple so whatever it does it’s genius”. if you’ve ever ACTUALLY went from crapple to android (unlike 99% of the comments here that say they have but in reality… well) you would notice a LOT of improvements over crapple. 1: The price to quality ratio is MUCH better that apple’s. 2: More customisation options. Unless you count changing your phone cover as “customizing”. 3: It’s not apple, so it’s better (see what i did there? I did the shit apple fanboy’s do) 4: No dumb “inovations”. 5: Simplifying things and making something that takes 3 seconds isn’t better, Sony, Samsung etc focus on more important things to improve. 03/06/2017 iAlex Reply Well you sound like Forest Gump in his movie when he said that his friend opened Apple company for selling fruits….

But if you’re like majority of people and have a Windows computer that’s a lie. I installed iTunes once and my computer was never the same again.

I have a android galaxy tab 3 and the iPod 6 generation and if I was to choose which is better it’s definitely Apples product and I never would get an android again. When I got my android new at Walmart it couldn’t even get the latest version, it was completely unbelievable. After I had it for 3 months it slowed down on me and its battery life is horrible. Now when I bought this IPod new I’ve had it for a double the time now and it works like new and best of all it can get the latest version. The quality of Apple is way better. In my opinion the iPhone is the best visual quality I’ve seen yet. Ive done some decent gaming on them and if you want something to save your progress then forget android, because not all the game link to your google play account so if you reset it the ones that don’t link are gone. Unlike apple I haven’t had any issues with it. I’ve lost decent money and progress on android because of it. Yes Apple does come out with the newest technology a bit latter then android but you can see it it a good way or a bad. The bad way would be that their slow, the good way you can see it as if their watching googles failing parts and their making it better. 01/03/2017 Marcelino Reply Also I can see you all are fighting over this topic which is pretty stupid. To be honest you can’t necessarily compare them. Everyone is different so everyone is going to want something different. If we all wanted android or we all wanted Apple we would become robots. If you wanted to find a phone to get then get into inside detail to see what your looking for. If you wanted fun texting and want to be more secure then go straight for apple because they got the best for that but if you wanted fun lock screens or be able to put micro SD cards and changeable batteries then go for android but let me remind you that anyone can take the SD card out and take your information. Hope this helps. 01/04/2017 LOREN FOK Reply people will buy iphone just because thats what everyone else has they dont even know what they are buying.

With the iPhone this does not happen. BUT the major improvement that will keep me with the iPhone is security !!!!!! 01/17/2017 Shivanki Sharma Reply Well said Josh Smith… But My view about your article is…No one can said this iPhone is better or Android is not Or Vice-Versa until you are not aware of their pros as well. There are alot to know about these two before making your mind to go for iPhone or Android, one of them. Both phones have their own features and plus points. It is insane to say this iPhone is best and other phones are rest. As we all know among both of these Android has very good quality of camera but latest iPhone 7 brings the revolution in the mobile market.

Is that the best you could do, it gives the article away as biased! Shame 01/29/2017 Ashkar Reply I was a Android addict until I choose iphone for an experiment. Now of course I’m an apple fan. 01/29/2017 THETRUEANDROIDUSER Reply Apple fanboys,crying it out.What a pity,brainwashed fools 01/30/2017 dstrauss Reply I have been an iPhone user since day one (currently 7 Plus), but this article is insanely prejudiced. Most of the alleged superiorities are interoperabilty between iPhones (iMessage, Airdrop) or between iPhone and other Apple devices (Handoff) – if you are a PC owner, or have a large number of friends or fellow users on Android, these advantages are insignificant at best. I will concede that updates and lack of carrier bloatware are significant pluses, the author is doing an extreme disservice to new users by basically promoting an iPhone prejudice. 01/31/2017 Matt Perkins Reply iPhones win over Android smartphones for these 5 critical reasons. Security, Privacy, Stability, Performance and Usability. iOS gets far less malware than Android, it has far less critical vulnerabilities than Android. Vulnerabilities are patched quicker in iOS. iOS crashes and freezes less than Android, Apple doesn’t harvest data to sell like Google does (Google has even started collecting identifiable data since they released their new voice assistant). iOS is a faster OS than Android is while Android smartphones slow down faster than the iPhone does. And of course iOS offers the better out of box experience. Not to mention you can never make Android as secure as iOS, only close to as secure. Part of the reason is even if you tweak your Android settings to be similar to iOS, the official Google Play Store gets far more malware than the AppStore and Cydia combined. So only way to even remotely match it is not download apps or games. My other favorite part of iOS over Android is the fact you can use true adblockers in iOS, not just adblock browsers without the need to root or jailbreak. Google will never allow you to block ads in Chrome or block all ads third party ads without rooting. And as you knowing rooting and jailbreaking merely lowers the security of the OS. That’s another thing Jailbroken iOS is more secure than untouched Android as long as you stick to the default repos in Cydia. 02/01/2017 Shaun Anderson Reply Android Download from unknown sources like a regular computer Download files from browser Plug in and transfer anything to and from computer. File System. Just acts more like a computer in regards to freedom to do as you will where iPhone is locked down like a game system. 03/06/2017 iAlex Reply You can do all that in iTunes. iPhone is more careful to protect data while android is less careful. Today security is most important and that is iOS goal. 02/02/2017 lg k4 ekran koruyucu Reply LG K10 LTE için sergi 1280 X 720 piksel yüksek çözünürlüklü ekran çözünürlüğe sahip IPS LCD yaptı. 02/10/2017 thomasammy749 Reply Stay at home mom Kelly Richards from New York after resigning from her full time job managed to average from $6000-$8000 a month from freelancing at home… This is how she done !!!!!!!!!!!!!http://jobbuzz7.com 02/14/2017 Debadeep Biswas Reply I also believe iPhone is better than Android. I am tired of using Android and going to buy iPhone soon for better camera, speed and style. 02/17/2017 LordyAlmighty Reply One VERY important fact that no one has mentioned… with Apple you can be a total amoral ignoramous and be surrounded by adoring fans !! Who really cares if the poor sods on the other side of the world live the lives of slaves? Who cares if they have to stand ALL day, and ASK for pissbreaks? Who cares if the companies solution to suicides are suicide nets around buildings and removing knives? Who cares if the iphone costs a dollar to make, but sold for $600? Who cares if most of the jobs are not in the countries paying for the status symbols? So lets be clear, its all about “im better than you because i can waste money on bling, and *&$! your community at the same time”. 02/18/2017 exycheezy Reply I’ve had both. many times. I’ve had every version of the iPhone. I’ve never had an Android phone update properly. My 3 year old plays on my old 2nd gen iPhone that has the latest IOS on it. . .. android can’t do that. with the exception of a Verizon flip phone, every single Android phone I’ve ever had got a virus, crashed and I had to reset to factory settings at least 2 times per phone. I have never, ever ever got a virus on ANY Apple product, and never had to put any software or app to keep it running correctly. As far as customization? Who cares. If you’re so busy and have so much time to waste trying to impress everyone with crazy fonts and wild customization, the iPhone is way to sleek, sophisticated and user -friendly for you. Software dictates hardware. The IOS blows Android OS away. And, any (anyone who’s actually worked on both will agree) Apple product gets sometimes twice the speed out of less RAM and processing than ANY other OS (Windows or Android). Give me stability anytime. so your phone has an expandable memory? What good is it when it won’t run half the time. Have a nice day all. . .. .after all, they’re just phones. . .. right? 02/19/2017 Richie Reply Some things to add (pros and cons) as a PC & Android guy that just switched to iPhone (but I’m staying on PC): 1) The iOS versions of Microsoft apps are better than the Android ones and they work great. 2) Article is correct: the iOS versions of apps are generally better than their Android counterparts, in ways you will notice. It’s really kind of a shame for Android – I don’t get why they don’t just match the exact app. 3) Lightning is neat but I found MicroUSB more useful, since it’s used for more devices, i.e. I have a MicroUSB running from my desk to my PC to charge my wireless mouse, and then I would also use it to charge my phone sometimes. 4) Yes I do miss customization heaven with Android, but this iPhone runs like total butter. Android runs WELL but this thing is so zippy and responsive – you wouldn’t believe it until you spent time with one. 5) ALSO customization isn’t as cut-off as it used to be with iOS. Some apps can latch onto some functions in the phone, kinda like installing an extension for your desktop browser. It’s something. Really I just bought an iPhone to “try something new” and I’m really liking it. 02/28/2017 Toby Reply Just do a Quick google search iphone is less reliable than Android, theres your Answer in the studies. End of debate… 03/01/2017 Viking Sheep Reply These comparisons are so lame… Eg: Country X is much better than the rest of the world, because the rest of the world have varying standards, while Country X has only 1 level of corruption. 03/06/2017 iAlex Reply First: great respect to Steve Jobs who dedicated his life to Apple iPhone invention and to make communication better more joyful between people. Also to feel the power and beauty of technology in your hand. How I wished that Isaac Newton or Ainstein or Nikola Tessa or… would see what we have today… Second: iPhone is far more serious for people who want job to be done as fast and simpler way without delays. Android phones are for kids who like customizations and pretty colors and to look like iron man or similar… Third: iPhone is made of better materials. And looks for business high class. Android phones are copying iPhone’s look especially Samsung. Fourth: iPhone technology, the software and hardware gives you exactly what you need. No more no less. Android technologies gives you extra things which are seldom used and are simply extra using more battery and device performance. Fifth: iPhone has a specific style in design. Keeping updating same style to better one making it each time better and better. Sixth: Applications on iPhone are much better with much less defects than Android. At the end, I had various Samsung, Sony, Huawei, Htc and iPhone phones. I choose iPhone. Now I have iPhone 6s+ black limited edition with golden Apple. It’s very nice piece of equipment. at the bottom line, Apollo 11 travelled to the moon using Fortan on its 360 kb computer. Today we are talking of gigs bytes. So I respect both iPhone and Android technologies for their great effort and progress. Competition shall exist to make difference and better.

Credit: Antos777/Shutterstock For smartphones, the answer is less a matter of physical age (except insofar as the user wants certain phone capabilities) and more about what kind of software the phone can run and whether that software has the latest known vulnerabilities patched. In that respect, iPhones and Android phones differ greatly. Mobile-device security resides in the software more than it does in the hardware. That's because hardware changes somewhat more slowly, and also because the kinds of attacks invented in the past several years focus on stealing money rather than exploiting hardware, said Chester Wisniewski, a senior security advisor at Sophos Canada in Vancouver. Smartphone users, Wisniewski said, tend to let their phones update software automatically, when they can. That's particularly true for iPhones. But issues arise as your smartphone gets older, especially if it's an Android device. MORE: Best Android Antivirus Software and Apps How long can you safely use an old iPhone? Apple supports its smartphones for about five years after a model is released, giving the devices the latest versions of iOS and the latest patches to known vulnerabilities. That's pretty generous considering that most people get a new smartphone every two or three years. For example, if you are using an iPhone 4s, released in October 2011, it might be difficult to upgrade to iOS 10, released in September 2016. But you would be able to use iOS 9, released in September 2015. The oldest iPhone that iOS 10 can run on is the iPhone 5, from September 2012. However, you can put money on the likelihood that the iPhone 5 won't be able to run iOS 11. There isn't a lot of iOS malware out there, so your chances of getting infected are slim, even if you do use an iPhone that's more than five years old. But it's better to be safe than sorry, especially when Apple makes upgrading the operating system so easy and convenient. As of late February 2017, according to Apple's own figures, roughly 79 percent of iDevice users had upgraded to iOS 10 and were receiving periodic security updates — even on devices nearly five years old. Make sure you join the club. How long can you safely use an old Android phone? Gauging an Android phone's safe-use limits can be harder, as Android phones are not as standardized as iPhones. But in general, an Android phone won't get any more security updates if it's more than three years old, and that's provided it can even get all the updates before then. After three years, you're better off getting a new phone. The product cycle on Android phones is less consistent than on iPhones. There are hundreds of smartphone makers that use (and alter) Android. It's less than certain, for example whether an old Samsung handset will run the latest version of the OS two years after the phone's introduction. MORE: How to Get Rid of Your Old Smartphone Only Google's own Pixel devices are guaranteed to get the latest Android security updates in a timely manner, although the latest Samsung and Motorola devices are often not far behind. For example, the current version of Android, Android 7 Nougat, released in August 2016, is not designed for compatibility with phones that use Qualcomm's Snapdragon 801/800 chipset, which includes many of the big-name handsets made in the last few years. That 2013 Samsung Galaxy S4 won't run Nougat, but neither will the Samsung Galaxy S5, LG G3 or OnePlus One, all flagship models released in the spring of 2014. However, the latter three can be upgraded to Android 6 Marshmallow (from fall 2015), and if so, some of these devices may even get security patches until the fall of 2017. Google's own Nexus 6 phone, released in the fall of 2014, can be upgraded to the latest version of Nougat (7.1.1) and will receive over-the-air security patches until the fall of 2017. But it won't be compatible with the upcoming Nougat 7.1.2. Credit: ShutterstockAnother problem is that older versions of the Android OS stick around for a lot longer than they should, as phone makers often fail to put the current version on second-tier or budget phones. As a result, many users start from behind and fall even further back as manufacturers, carriers and users themselves fail to implement system updates. In late March 2017, per Google's own figures, Nougat was running on 3 percent of Android devices and Marshmallow had a 31 percent market share. But the other two-thirds of Android devices worldwide were running older versions that were no longer getting security updates. Those phones, hundreds of millions of them, were and are inherently unsafe to use. How long can you safely use an old 'dumb' cellphone? One might actually be safer using a cellphone that predates smartphones, instead of an out-of-date smartphone. "I quite like the idea of carrying a 'dumb' phone from the late 1990s rather than a smartphone of today," said Graham Cluley, a security analyst who has worked in the field for more than 20 years. "If all I want [the phone] to do is send text messages and make calls, chances are that it will not only have little fear of malware — it will also have a lot better battery life to boot." An ancient Nokia candy-bar or flip phone, lacking a browser, would be safe from most internet-based attacks, since it would be effectively invisible to internet-connected devices. But that safety eliminates the ability to do anything on the internet as well. Alas, those old phones aren't invulnerable, because old malware never really goes away. "There is still code on old phones, and it may have been effectively abandoned and therefore unpatched," said Steve Santorelli, director of analysis and outreach for Lake Mary, Florida-based threat-intelligence firm Team Cymru. "We're still seeing newly discovered issues that have actually been around for many years, but only just discovered by researchers." The reason the old dumb phones are less vulnerable is because they're no longer attractive targets, not because of any inherent superiority. The right way to deal with aging phones "The alternative, and arguably the better option," Santorelli said, "is to have a smartphone, but ensure it's fully patched with a good password-saving tool package, and a user with some awareness of threats and ways to guard against them. Two-factor authentication will also keep you out of trouble a lot of the time." In that sense, Santorelli said, patches are crucial, even for third-party apps that aren't part of the operating system. "Every mobile operating system and most applications will come out with patches all the time," he said. "Researchers find holes in software and developers fix them, hopefully, before too many hackers start to use them to compromise your system." So update those apps every time the Google Play or iOS app stores tell you to. Accept the upgrades to the latest operating-system versions when they arrive. Install and use mobile antivirus software on your Android device. (Sorry, but that doesn't exist for iOS.) And if your smartphone no longer gets OS updates or security patches, then it's time to move on.

It’s part of Apple’s push into late night TV advertising, it has been ramping up these efforts and this is a clear signal that Apple is serious about this. Variety reports that Saturday Night Live has signed a similar deal with Verizon.

SNL is going to do something similar for Apple, however, details about the ad that Apple wants to make are not available right now.

By Agamoni Ghosh April 9, 2017 11:16 BST The iPhone 7's home button does not move, but instead provides haptic feedback when pushedIBTimes UK iPhone 7 and 7 Plus users who are already reportedly facing issues with their home buttons will not be too pleased to learn that they may never be able to repair them. Apple confirmed to Motherboard that in case of any damage to the home buttons of the two flagships only a replacement can be done through the company's "iPhone Calibration Machine". No repair by any third-party store or even Apple is possible for the buttons. The company has reportedly used software locks to prevent independent repair of specific parts of the phone like the home button raising questions about the repairability of Apple products. The button will only work with the original part that it was shipped with. A teardown of the iPhone 7 conducted by the independent iPhone repair shop iOutlet shows when the home button is swapped, the screen displays an error message that says: "The home button may need service." The latest revelations bring the focus back to the ongoing debate on "right to repair" with consumers demanding the right to repair everything they own as per their choice. The model already exists in the automobile industry but the electronic hardware industry is one of the biggest opponents of the rule. Companies like Apple feel that repair information is proprietary to them and want to shut down independent repair shops. Eight states in the US have introduced the "right to repair" legislation which would require electronics manufacturers to sell repair parts to consumers and independent repair shops. Apple is one of the companies planning to challenge the legislation. More from IBTimes UK How much will the iPhone 8 cost compared to the Samsung Galaxy S8?

 The iPhone 8 launch will go up against a problem of Apple's own making Jim Edwards Apr. 9, 2017, 10:38 AM 43,303 facebook linkedin twitter email print A speculative rendering of an iPhone with a curved screen.@MesutGDesigns / Tech designs There are two ways to think about the launch of the new iPhone, expected in September: It will be the biggest iPhone launch Apple has ever done, eclipsing iPhone 6, as Apple has a massive installed base of users waiting to upgrade to the first truly new iPhone since 2015. Some are calling this the iPhone "super-cycle." Or — conversely — it will be a distinctly "meh" launch, as iPhone users hold onto their phones for longer and longer periods, and delay replacing them until prices fall in 2018.  The second scenario is very real for Apple, as two of its flagship products already suffer from a lack of upgrade sales: The iPad and the Mac laptops and desktops. The problem is that Apple's devices are almost too good: People don't replace their iPads because they don't need to. An old one works just as well as a new one for most users. iPad sales declined 19% last quarter as a result. And Apple's newer Macs are fine. But I am typing this on an old Macbook built in 2012 — and it works just fine, too. I am under no pressure to get a new one. Mac sales were flat in the most recent period. Now the same thing is happening to iPhone. Time was, the useful life of a smartphone was about two years. That also roughly coincided with wireless subscriber contract lengths, prompting a giant wave of people to buy a new phone about once every two years. But Apple's phones are well-made, and now they last much longer. Since iPhone 6, Apple hasn't given the iPhone a dramatic update. If you're still using an iPhone 6 you haven't missed much by not upgrading to iPhone 6s or iPhone 7. That quality and longevity are coming back to haunt Apple, according to Citi analysts Jim Suva and Asiya Merchant. Apple's installed base of customers is getting larger, suggesting that when they upgrade sales of the new "iPhone 8" will be massive. But at the same time, replacement rates are stretching from two years to three years, lowering the percentage of existing customers that make new purchases: Citi So, even though the installed base of iPhone users will be 500 million people this year (up from 300 million in 2015), the number of potential upgraders will fall from 85% to 75%. Android is also getting better at holding its customers, so the percentage of new users who switch into iPhone will decline from 10% to 4% of new sales, the Citi team believes: Citi Essentially, Apple has trained its customers to make a choice: Get the new phone. Hold their current iPhone for an extra year until an even newer device comes along. Or wait a few months for the current device to decline in price after the new device is launched. The result is that while Apple will likely see sales growth from the new phone it nonetheless complicates matters if the company wants to put on an overwhelming show of strength for the iPhone's 10th anniversary this year. Citi has a "buy" rating on AAPL and believes the company will still get "strong growth" from iPhone 8. EXCLUSIVE FREE REPORT: 25 Big Tech Predictions by BI Intelligence.

Even for suppliers that know the risks, a contract with the company is seen as a badge of prestige that will bring in other customers. AP by Tim Bradshaw Business is booming at Cirrus Logic, the Texas-based audio chipmaker. Sales are growing by more than 25 per cent for the third year in a row and its shares are up by 70 per cent in the past 12 months. However, despite running a public company with a market capitalisation of $US4bn, chief executive Jason Rhode struggles when explaining to investors the finer details of its impressive results. Even though a single customer accounts for two-thirds of its annual revenues – and as much as 85 per cent in the quarter ending in December – Mr Rhode never dares mention it by name. On every quarterly earnings call, Mr Rhode trots out the same carefully worded phrase: "While we understand there is intense interest related to our largest customer, in accordance with our policy, we do not discuss specifics about our business relationship." Of course, every Cirrus investor knows that the unnamed customer is Apple, the world's leading maker of smartphones by sales. When Apple revealed strong demand for its new iPhone 7 in mid-September, Cirrus's shares leapt by 8 per cent in a single day. Apple headquarters in California. The company's patronage is a blessing when everything is going well but it can quickly become a curse. Marcio Jose Sanchez Yet Apple's obsessive secrecy, coupled with the extreme demands it makes of its manufacturers and the competition to join their ranks, means its suppliers dare not put a foot wrong. Apple's patronage is a blessing when everything is going well but it can quickly become a curse. The consequences of a break-up can be devastating, as London-listed chip designer Imagination Technologies discovered this week. Related Quotes 5 years 1 Day Last updated: Updating... Last updated: Updating... View full quote Company Profile ASX Announcements Expand ASX Announcements View all announcements Imagination's graphics processors have been a core part of the iPhone since it first launched a decade ago. Its shares lost almost two-thirds of their value on Monday when the chipmaker revealed that Apple "has been working on a separate, independent graphics design in order to control its products and will be reducing its future reliance on Imagination's technology". It was one of the most dramatic share-price reactions for a large UK company - previously worth £754m - in a decade. Imagination's relationship with Apple has been rocky for a while. Early last year, amid deepening losses as it struggled to adapt to the smartphone market slowdown, its long-serving chief executive Sir Hossein Yassaie left the company. Soon after, it emerged that Apple - which owns an 8.1 per cent stake in the chipmaker - had discussed acquiring Imagination outright but ultimately decided against making an offer. Today, Apple still accounts for more than half of Imagination's revenues but within two years it intends to "no longer use the group's intellectual property", Imagination said in a statement. Gene Munster, a longtime Apple analyst now a venture investor at Loup Ventures, compares investing in the group's suppliers to playing "Russian roulette". "It's the classic deal with the devil," he says. "You know you are going to pay a price for it, whether it is getting left behind completely or squeezed on your profits." A Pokemon Go player attempts to catch a Charmander character. Augmented reality products are capturing consumers' imaginations. Thomas Cytrynowicz Apple's abrupt severance may seem ruthless but it shows how the group is moving to own more of the core technologies at the heart of its products. By making such a drastic shift into graphics processors, Apple is seizing control of a component that is becoming essential to not just video and gaming, but two coming tech megatrends: artificial intelligence and augmented reality. That will come as little consolation to Imagination, which is facing what one analyst called its "black swan" moment. For many such vendors, though, the pattern is all too familiar. Not the first "This is not the first time this has happened in the Apple supply chain and reminds us that a discount should be applied to Apple suppliers' valuations," wrote Morgan Stanley analysts in a note to clients this week. Apple declined to comment for this piece. An early victim was PortalPlayer, a provider of audio technology to the iPod, which relied on Apple for around 90 per cent of its sales. In December 2005, PortalPlayer was riding high on the success of Apple's MP3 player, with its chief executive saying it was "well positioned for the year ahead" thanks to its "strong" relationship with its unnamed "leading customers". Just four months later, Apple switched to another supplier and the company lost half of its value almost overnight. Before the year was out, PortalPlayer had been sold to Nvidia, the graphics chipmaker. As a result, publicly-listed manufacturers who count Apple as a customer, tend to trade at a lower multiple than their peers, analysts say. On Wall Street, this phenomenon is known as the "Apple risk discount". Last September, analysts at RBC Capital Markets noticed that 10 of 11 suppliers with significant revenues from Apple were seeing their gross margins contract. "We think Apple has been pushing for price discounts from multiple suppliers," RBC said in a note at the time, as a way to mitigate increases in its own costs due to currency fluctuations. Yet even for suppliers who know the risks, a contract with Apple is seen as a badge of prestige that will bring in other customers. It also brings huge volumes - Apple will sell more than 240m iPhones this year, according to analysts. "The best thing is to do the deal with Apple anyway," says Mr Munster. "Even though you are probably going to get throttled in the end, you will have three years of great times you probably would never have had if you hadn't done it." Nonetheless, news of Imagination's predicament will have triggered concern across Apple's supply chain. "Companies working with them in certain areas are really struggling to get financing, because of the risk," said an executive at one company that has worked with the iPhone maker for many years. "Every bank has every Apple vendor on a watchlist now. The negative impact on [Apple's] supply chain is huge." Tiny electronic brains Imagination is an extreme case because Apple is not just swapping to another supplier - it is taking development of the same technology in-house. Chipmaking is not a new endeavour for Apple, though. Since it acquired PA Semi in 2008, it has developed formidable expertise in crafting the tiny electronic brains inside its devices. As well as the A-series processors that power its iPhones and iPads, Apple has custom-designed special chips that run in its Watch and AirPods wireless headphones. Analysts see this as a key strategic advantage for the company, given that the huge resources required to make custom processors put them out of reach of many rivals. Yet creating a new graphics processor (or GPU) is far more complex and ambitious than anything Apple has attempted so far. Only a handful of companies other than Imagination, including Nvidia, AMD, Qualcomm and SoftBank's Arm, are able to produce the technology at real scale. Apple has been steadily poaching employees from Imagination as it learns to fine-tune its off-the-shelf processors. "Apple has demonstrated extraordinarily well that its chips can be well optimised for the specific functions of the iPhone," says Geoff Blaber, analyst at CCS Insight. Ditching Imagination for its own GPU is "just Apple being Apple - they want to customise as much as they can", he adds. "Given the clear directions Apple is moving in, a GPU is only going to become more important." In today's iPhones, graphics processors are used to make richer video games and more visually sophisticated apps. But the next model will feature a new front-facing camera that can sense the depth in a scene, such as capturing all the features of a face in 3D, according to people familiar with Apple's plans. That will enable not only new security techniques, such as a user's face unlocking the phone instead of today's fingerprint reader, but also new kinds of features and inputs that are loosely gathered under the buzz term of " augmented reality". That could mean elaborate special effects in photos and videos, like a supercharged version of Pokémon Go or Snapchat's selfie masks, which give people dog ears or turn them into a character from a TV show. Beyond the iPhone, Apple is also researching AR glasses - a new frontier in wearable technology that companies across Silicon Valley are spending billions on to develop. "This [Imagination move] is as clear a nod that Apple has given that it sees a dramatic shift in how people are going to interact with their devices," says Mr Munster. "This is like the tremor before the earthquake." Core technology For such a secretive company, Apple chief Tim Cook has been unusually vocal about his enthusiasm for augmented reality, saying it could be "huge", as big as the iPhone is today. "I get excited because of the things that could be done that could improve a lot of lives and be entertaining," Mr Cook told the Independent in February. "It's not a product per se - it's a core technology." A graphics processor is also important beyond images because its architecture is uniquely suited for processing the huge amounts of information that lie behind AI systems, which already appear in today's iPhones in its Siri virtual assistant's suggestions and automatic face recognition in photos. While Apple dreams up new applications for AR and AI, Imagination faces a nightmare scenario from which few suppliers have ever fully recovered. Knowing that it has worked with Apple for so long, it might attract renewed interest from rival smartphone makers, analysts say, while it may yet be able to force Apple to license its intellectual property. Royalties would bring in less revenues than chip sales but command a higher profit margin. "Imagination believes that it would be extremely challenging to design a brand new GPU architecture from basics without infringing its intellectual property rights," the company said on Monday, flexing its legal muscles. Perhaps Imagination might learn from the experience of another British supplier to Apple, audio chipmaker Wolfson. After it lost Apple as a customer in 2008, Wolfson posted five years of operating losses before being bought by a larger rival: Cirrus Logic. magazine.afr.com Financial Times Share Share via Email Share on Google Plus Post on facebook wall Share on twitter Post to Linkedin Share on Reddit Advertisement Advertisement Commercial Real Estate Related articles Downer must sell unloved Spotless deal 5 mins ago BHP drives ASX to two-year high 2 mins ago Wall Street could stop ASX bull run 21 mins ago Why you should stick with blue chips 47 mins ago Contains: Video Tillerson takes a hard line on Russia 1 hr ago Contains: Video Latest Stories Dixon Hospitality IPO shelved; private equity talks continue 3 mins ago Downer must sell unloved Spotless deal 5 mins ago BHP drives ASX to two-year high 2 mins ago More Advertisement Lang Walker gambles on $100m Fijian paradise How Jose Neves built a fashion unicorn Fashion that fuses East and West 43 little accessories to stash away Why chefs need a fashion makeover Nominate a True Leader for the 2017 BOSS list Forget the robots, hire old people The start-ups challenging big power How burnt-out execs found new purpose How business can win back public trust Tasmania bakery makes off-the-grid croissants Amex exec finds local flavour at sports games Barossa wine auction solves a big problem 5 of the best houses on sale in Australia now Good times ahead with luxury gifts for all Special Reports Australian standards add up for birds nests Mining boom spawns PlantMiner Agile enough to take on the big players Ansarada's next goal to make organisations run better Trajan allies science with well-being Fairfax Media Publications Pty Ltd © Copyright 2017 Reprints & Permissions Privacy Policy Terms & Conditions of Use Experience afr.com free for 1 month Enjoy unlimited access to Australia's best business news and market insights across desktop, tablet and mobile Find out more Already a subscriber?

For those that are hanging onto their jailbreak, you might’ve noticed that there have been some attention-worthy jailbreak tweak releases this week, and in this roundup, we’ll go over all of them starting with our favorites. Our favorite releases this week Confero 2 – $1.99 Confero 2 is quite an amazing tweak in that it will let you group all apps with unread notification badges in one place. Since badges are often overlooked and clutter the Home screen in undesirable ways, this offers a decent solution to the ongoing badge clutter “problem” that many people complain about. It provides users with a unique interface that can be viewed by tapping on a Status Bar icon. After revealing the interface, it’s easy to interact with apps that you have missed notifications from and handle your notifications. To learn more about Confero 2 and how it can help make your life better, check out our full review. SpecialFaces – FREE Jailbreakers who use an Apple Watch are no longer limited to the Apple Watch faces that came with the device from the factory. A new beta tweak called SpecialFaces enables the Hermes and Nike Apple Watch faces on your jailbroken iPhone from the Apple Watch app and then lets you apply them to any Apple Watch you might have, whether it’s the normal stainless steel model, the Sport, or even the Edition model. The tweak isn’t perfect just yet, as there are some glitches, but it’s still a great proof of concept that shows porting these watch faces to unsupported devices is at least possible. You can read our full review on SpecialFaces to learn more about how it works. Springtomize 4 – $4.99 One of the most notable jailbreak tweak releases of the week was Springtomize 4, which is the all-inclusive SpringBoard customization tweak that’s been hyped up since the conception of the iOS 10 jailbreak. This tweak offers so many customization options for various parts of your iPhone that it’s often considered the one-stop-shop for all jailbreakers. There are more than 100 different options to configure for almost every part of the iOS UI. You can learn more about what can be configured in our full review. WeatherLock – $0.99 WeatherLock is a pretty neat tweak that replaces the Lock screen’s typical wallpaper with the weather animations from the Weather app. It uses Apple’s own weather animations, which are battery efficient in their nature, and it uses your current location’s weather conditions to display the proper kind of weather animations for you at any given time of the day. To learn more about how it works, check out our full review. Other releases this week BetterMessages: Brings a range of new features to the Messages app (free – review) Brightify: Gives Spotify a light-colored makeover (free – review) Chirp: Wholesome reminders on the Lock screen (free) ColorComments: Colorizes each level of comments in the official Reddit app (free – review) Contactifier: Displays additional contact information in the Messages app chat bubbles (free) NoLockScreenCam: Disallows Lock screen camera access (free – review) NoPaperLax: Disables the Parallax effect on the Home screen without disabling other movement animations (free) NotesCharacterCount: Adds a character counter to the Notes app (free – review) QuickNowPlaying: Displays alerts when music changes on your device (free) RedditSafariVC: Replaces the webkit controller in theReddit app with a Safari instance for speed improvements (free) ScreenshotBanners: Displays a banner notification with a screenshot preview after taking a screenshot (free – review) SettingsPatch: Hides unwanted sections from the Settings app (free – review) Share Anywhere: Bring up a share sheet anywhere in iOS with an Activator gesture (free – review) TransparentWeather: Makes the background of the Weather app transparent (free – review) Wrapping things up, we can confidently say that this week has been productive for the Cydia Store.

Apple currently intends on the store being “flagship” in nature, with a design akin to that of Apple’s World Trade Center location in New York City… Mujjo Wallet iPhone 7 Case The new details come via a report from AppleInsider, which cites a “person familiar with the matter.” Apple is said to be taking over large retail space in Antara Fashion Hall, which was most recently occupied by Crate & Barrel. The location is twice the size of Apple’s current Mexico City store in Centro Santa Fe mall’s high-end Via Santa Fe wing. The design of the new Ciudad de Mexico store is said to be similar to that of the new World Trade Center store in New York City, which just opened last August. The store features high-end design traits such as a high ceilings, a 37-foot custom-built TV screen, and much more. Apple’s new Ciudad de Mexico store is also expected to be multi-level, meaning the Genius Bar and retail space might be split from one another, similar to other multi-level Apple Stores around the world. Apple’s WTC retail location The Antara Fashion Hall first opened its doors in 2006 and comes in at over half a million square feet. It features 3 floors of retail space, restaurants, and a movie theater. It’s located three blocks north of Avenida Presidente Masaryk, which is known for its high-end, luxury shopping amenities. Specific details about when Apple plans to open its new flagship retail location remain unclear, but it’s likely a long way away at this point. The news of Apple’s newest Mexico City location comes as its first retail space in the city, opened last September, is experiencing unusually high sales and struggling to keep up with demand. Today’s report also adds details such that Apple is mulling an expansion in Brazil. Company officials are reportedly in the process of determining whether or not Apple will open two additional stores in the country, including one new flagship location in Sao Paulo. As of now, Apple operates two retail locations in Brazil. Chance Miller @ChanceHMiller Chance covers Apple for 9to5Mac and contributes to 9to5Google, Electrek, and 9to5Toys.

Snapchat's parent slips after a pair of ho-hum analyst initiations and a report that Apple is working on a video-sharing platform. Rick Munarriz (TMFBreakerRick) Apr 9, 2017 at 10:08AM It was another rough week for shares of Snap, Inc. (NYSE:SNAP), slipping 7.7% after a pair of analysts initiated coverage with uninspiring ratings. Things also didn't get any easier on the competitive front with a report claiming that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is hoping to launch a video sharing and editing app that could possibly vie for Snapchat's young media-slicing audience. Let's start with Wall Street. More than two dozen analysts have initiated coverage of the rapidly growing dot-com darling since its IPO more than a month ago, and that pace was expected to slow to a trickle after its underwriters put out their reports two weeks ago. Two new initiations took place last week, and both went with the equivalent of neutral ratings.  Jim Kelleher at Argus slapped Snap stock with a short-term "hold" rating. Like many skeptics, Kelleher thinks the stock is priced for perfection at current levels. He did open the door for a change of heart -- and a long-term "buy" rating -- if the stock continues to drop with its fundamentals remaining intact. Rich Greenfield at BTIG Research followed, initiating coverage on Snap with a "neutral" rating. He's concerned that the stock appears fairly valued at its current $30.2 billion enterprise value, and it will take a lot of innovation to justify gains and spur headier growth in the future.  Image source: Snap, Inc. Apple jacked Bloomberg reported that Apple is in the process of developing a video sharing and editing app. Apple has been putting out video software for ages, but this would be a new iOS platform, and one that integrates easily with iPads and iPhones. There will be a social bent to the new offering, as Apple strives for deeper social ties within its product lines, and that could throw a wrench into Snapchat's popularity if it takes off. The silver lining for Snap bulls is that Apple has struggled in the past to gain relevance on the social front. Does anyone remember when Apple's Ping tried to create a social layer to iTunes? If Apple tries to use the new platform as a way to keep iOS users close, it would also seem to suggest that it may not come out for the wider Android audience.    Snap has proved to be a volatile investment in its early days as a public company. It's had a move higher of lower of at least 7.7% in five of its first six weeks on the market. Last week's run is actually tame compared with the first four weeks of double-digit percentage gains before following that up with a 0.9% decline. The stock is still trading comfortably above its $17 IPO price, but another volatile week or two on the downside can change that. Snap is a stock that loves to move.  Rick Munarriz owns shares of Apple. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Apple.

Around 4:50 p.m. EDT, the Turkish Crime Family—a collective of apparent hackers and data collectors— received a payment of just over 401.78 BTC, or about $482,000. The group had been threatening to remotely erase a database of iCloud accounts it had collected if it did not receive payment. Read: How To Change Your iCloud Password: Apple Denies Hackers Stole iCloud Credentials The origin of the payment is unclear, but given the company’s previous statements on the issue, it is unlikely the payment came from Apple. The transaction was believed to have been sent through a Bitcoin tumbler, which are designed to anonymize cryptocurrency transactions so they cannot be traced back to an individual. Apple did not respond to a request for comment. A member of the Turkish Crime Family operating the group’s Twitter account told International Business Times the group couldn’t provide any confirmation where the payment came from, but said, “either way somebody with 400k+ making these claims should not be taken as a joke.” The group member said the Turkish Crime Family will “not attack Apple” as a result of the payment. “A deal is a deal,” the account proprietor said. Security researcher Troy Hunt suggested on Twitter that the transaction was fake. Using a tumbler may be evidence of this, as it obscures the sender of the the funds, which Hunt intimated was the group itself attempting to save face. The alleged payment came hours after the group’s initial deadline of 7:30 p.m. GMT (3:30 p.m. EDT), though the group claimed on Twitter to be in touch with a “negotiator” who was working on an agreement with Apple. Read: Apple, iCloud Accounts Stolen? Hackers Blackmailing Apple Over Supposed Stolen Credentials The group claimed to be in possession of an upward of 800 million Apple and iCloud credentials, which it gathered and assembled from a number of previous database leaks. A sample of the accounts indicated that at least some of them were valid, but it is impossible to say how many may have been affected had the threat been carried out. Despite ending the iCloud attack—whether because the group received its requested ransom or because it never had the resources to carry out the attack in the first place—a member of the group promised that the Turkish Crime Family had future plans in the works. The member said the group is still intending to launch an “unlocks service” which appears to be a service where users will be able to pay $10 to get a password associated with an Apple ID. “This is just the start of the group,” the person said.

At 11, he has already owned about a dozen Apple devices from a Mac mini to an Apple watch. His Apple knowledge is deep from watching all the company's keynotes on product introductions including classics he found online featuring the late Steve Jobs, Apple's founder and original genius. He dressed up as Jobs for Halloween, while his friend went as Microsoft founder Bill Gates. "I would say I'm a fan and almost a geek," Tim said. Young Apple fan reviews new store So it wasn't surprising Tim was first in line to see the new Apple store in the Woodland Mall, in the Grand Rapids suburb of Kentwood. He arrived 80 minutes before the store's 10 a.m. opening on April 8, wearing his green Apple Camp T-shirt. Tim was rewarded by not only being the first through the doors, but hearing his name chanted by dozens of blue-shirted Apple employees as he and other customers were greeted by applause. The big reveal comes after the construction was hidden behind a big black wall for nearly a year. The Cupertino, Calif.-based tech giant didn't confirm the store until last week, and declined to speak on the record about it. The store was such a top-secret that many of the employees didn't even see the new digs until the night before the opening, one employee was overheard telling a customer. Reporters were given access to the store on Saturday to take photos and talk to customers for the first hour, but weren't allowed to interview employees. The store is the first of Apple's six Michigan locations with a new design. Apple has redone about 40 stores in the last year beginning with its iconic San Francisco Union Square location. It's easy to see why the new West Michigan store took so long to complete. The brightly-lit 8,000-square-foot interior is meticulous in detail and design, from the 14 custom-built wooden tables to the shelves along the walls. A billboard-size screen, with ultra high resolution to display Apple products, covers most of the back wall. In front are about a dozen blocks that can double as seating, or as a tunnel for kids waiting while their parents play with their tech toys. Giant leather balls are hidden in some of the empty blocks. The area is described as "The Forum," where everyone - from kids to aspiring developers - can gather for sessions to learn how to better use their Apple devices. The aisles that run along the walls of interactive displays have been dubbed "The Avenue." Apple says the concept is "inspired by the window displays along a boulevard that dynamically change with the season." The new layout is intended to make it easier for shoppers to get a hands-on experience with Apple products as they shop. The initial wave of customers who came for the store's opening were impressed with the new store, which replaces the original store opened in 2005. Doubling the size of the store made a big difference. "It's not so crowded anymore." said Mary Vezino who came with her husband Kevin, on Saturday. The Lowell couple have been loyal Apple customers for a decade. Ekam Motwani, an 8th grader from Ada, was bummed that he still couldn't find an airpod wireless headphone in stock, even though he arrived minutes after the store's opened. The only one on the shelves was bought by Tim, the first customer. "Overall, the store is good," said Ekam, who has been an Apple fan since getting his first iPad in the first grade. Mike Bashaw, a former employee, was also impressed. "I feel like it exceeded people's expectations," said Bashaw, who was second in line. The Holland resident's favorite feature of the store is the cell phone case display "It looks neat and clean," said Bashaw, who liked the hidden shelf behind each case with a stash of more cases.

Andrew Tonner (TMFTheDude) Apr 9, 2017 at 9:11AM Warren Buffett's stock picking skills are legendary. Thanks to his once-in-a-generation abilities, shares of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK.B) have compounded at an average annual rate of 20% per year over the past half-century. It's a track record that may never be replicated. Even at 86 years old today, Buffett remains as active as ever, though he has since added two additional portfolio managers -- Todd Combs and Ted Weschler -- to help deploy Berkshire's billions in capital. After scanning Berkshire's latest 13-F filing, names including Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Twenty-First Century Fox (NASDAQ:FOX) (NASDAQ:FOXA) stand out as particularly interesting potential investments right now. Here's why shares of these two companies make for compelling Buffett stocks to buy in April. Apple After first being purchased by one of his investing lieutenants in 2016, Buffett spearheaded Berkshire's recent doubling-down on Apple shares. In the past few months, the Oracle increased Berkshire's Apple investment to a stake worth nearly $20 billion. And although the move breaks with his long-standing aversion to technology companies, his purchase of the Mac maker is a classic Buffett investment in virtually every other sense. I've gone to great lengths to argue the bull thesis for Apple shares in several articles as of late, so I won't provide as exhaustive of an analysis here as I might otherwise -- the accompanying links should more than get you up to speed. That said, Apple enjoys several useful catalysts that suggest its shares will continue to rise in the coming months. Apple shares tend to handily outperform the broader market in the run up to major iPhone releases. With one-third of its estimated installed base using iPhones that are more than two years old, the stage again seems set for Apple to trigger a massive upgrade cycle with the release of its reportedly redesigned 10th anniversary iPhone this fall. Despite this likely return to growth, Apple remains far cheaper than the overall market. And its overflowing cash hoard gives Apple the ability to enhance its shareholder returns through any number of potential avenues.  Image source: Getty Images. Twenty-First Century Fox Berkshire began buying shares of Twenty-First Century Fox in the fourth quarter of 2014. Berkshire's initial purchase totaled 4.75 million shares, worth $181 million at the end of the period. Berkshire has since nearly doubled its ownership stake, reporting control of 8.9 million shares in its latest 13-F, a stake of about $285 million in dollar terms. The relatively small dollar values at work here, at lest for Berkshire, suggest that one of Buffett's two investing lieutenants initiated the position. Either way, the move reflects an increasing bullishness toward media assets from Berkshire, a perspective that's understandable judging by recent trends in the industry. Consolidation has been a especially potent trend, as content producers like Twenty-First Century Fox have become acquisition targets. To this end, AT&T's pending buyout of Time Warner shows why Twenty-First Century Fox could find itself an acquisition target at some point soon. Spurring this is the fact that media distribution channels are expected to shift as new wireless standards, such as 5G, allow for ultra-fast streaming over wireless networks directly to mobile devices. Doing so will likely require so-called "wireless bundle" providers like AT&T to negotiate for content deals with existing cable companies, like Comcast. As such, the safest way to ensure a company like AT&T can secure rights to critical channels is to also own broadcast content that other cable providers need for their own bundles. In light of that, names like Charter Communications -- also a Berkshire holding -- or Verizon Communications could look to purchase Twenty-First Century Fox to continue this trend. This highlights what makes Twenty-First Century Fox a suitable Buffett stock. The company's durable competitive advantage is its content assets and brands, which are difficult to replicate or challenge. Regardless of your politics, it's probably safe to say that it would be virtually impossible to challenge media assets like Fox News among its constituents. In this sense, Twenty-First Century Fox seems like a classic Buffet stock to invest in at a time when content assets are in high demand. Andrew Tonner owns shares of Apple.

News Stocks Technology Science Tech Space Human Earth Health Politics World Videos TheTape Latest Follow WSP Newsletter RSS Facebook Twitter Google+ Search for: HomeNewsWhy Would Apple Want to Make GPU Chips? (AAPL) Why Would Apple Want to Make GPU Chips? (AAPL) Imagination Technologies has long been known as the company behind Apple's graphics. In a little over a year, all that will change. April 9, 2017 WSP In an announcement that was as surprising as it was inevitable, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) notified Imagination Technologies Group, a key GPU core licenser to Cupertino for years, that their longstanding business partnership is coming to an end. Specifically, the iPhone maker says that within 15 – 24 months, they will stop using Imagination’s IP (intellectual property) for their new products in lieu of GPU (graphics processing unit) chips that they will be designing themselves. In short, Apple is saying that from hereon, they will be developing their own GPU, a move that will enable the tech giant to have more control over its upcoming products. It also means that Apple will no longer be making royalty payments to Imagination based on their present license and royalty agreement. Although Apple is presently Imagination’s largest customer, accounting for about half its revenue, the chip designs of the U.K.-based graphics IP firm are not exclusively used in Apple products. Imagination’s technology is also being used in virtual reality headsets, wearable devices, consumer multimedia products, and even in automobiles too. Still, losing Apple is considered as a big blow for Imagination. It’s clearly reflected in the company’s share price which have dropped to record lows. Prior to Apple’s announcement, the company’s value was estimated at more than 750 million Pounds. Its value has now crashed to less than 250 million Pounds. On the other hand, the move is a big leap for Apple. And it’s an exciting prospect for Apple fanatics too. Because an Apple-made GPU should necessarily complement an Apple-made processor. Instead of depending on someone else’s technology, designing your own will make it easier to do adjustments and initiate changes needed so your devices will work as you want them to. If before, Apple could only tweak its software to match its hardware, with this move, they will now be able to tweak their hardware to match their software as well. And in case something doesn’t go as planned, there’ll be no one else to blame. And that’s a big motivation to make sure everything is as perfect as it can be. That said, however, it isn’t that simple. Why? Because Imagination’s tech has been the sole basis of all of Apple’s graphics – starting from the very first iPhone. From its part, Imagination is contesting the notion that Apple will be able to design a brand new GPU architecture from basics, noting that any GPU Cupertino will develop will in one way or another infringe on Imagination’s patented technology or confidential information. Imagination also said that it reserves the right to challenge any unauthorized uses of its technology. Complicating the matter further is that fact that Apple is part owner of the British chip designer and holds about 8.5% of its shares which nosedived by nearly 70%, after Apple said that it would stop licensing the company’s technology. That raises the possibility that Apple’s current threat to cut its future reliance on Imagination might be a bargaining strategy to lower its licensing fees to the company. And this is what makes the situation quite complicated. It’s also why discussions between the two companies will not likely lead to any kind of settlement any time soon given that Imagination is intent on defending their IP rights. Additionally, they are asking Apple to provide proof that it can truly do away with all of Imagination’s technology. So far, though, Apple has yet to respond to the request. We’re now part of a waiting game. Partners before, opponents today? Let’s hope not. That said, all indications point toward a legal battle ahead.

(AAPL) Harvey Lubin April 9, 2017 at 10:45 am Apple has probably been working on developing (designing and prototyping) its own GPU for at least the past two years, if not longer. And Imagination Technologies must have known this, or at the very least suspected it. Last year Apple made offers to acquire Imagination Technologies, but the management at Imagination Technologies refused to discuss this possibility with Apple. With Imagination Technologies’ awareness that Apple was developing its own GPU, and rebuffing Apple’s attempts to acquire the company at a much higher value than it is now, it was only a matter of time before Apple threw in the towel and decided to go ahead without trying to acquire Imagination Technologies. The management of Imagination Technologies have only themselves to blame for the nearly 70% drop in the company’s value. Reply Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

lifehacker Deadspin Fusion Gizmodo Jalopnik Jezebel Kotaku Lifehacker The Root Video Skillet Two Cents Vitals Gear Apple New App Attempts to Make Editing Short Videos Fun, Ends Up Being Totally Confusing  Thorin KlosowskiThursday 2:15pm Filed to: downloads apple iphone downloads ios downloads video video editing 4 1 Edit Promote Share to Kinja Toggle Conversation tools Go to permalink iPhone: Apple Clips, Apple’s newest app, is an attempt at making a video editing app that works something like Snapchat or Instagram, without the social component. The end result is a bit baffling to use, though it does show some promise. Advertisement As a video editor, Apple Clips is as simple as it gets. You can shoot video, crop it down, then apply a variety of filters. The first filter you can add is a voice transcription tool, which Apple calls Live Titles. Tap the word bubble icon and it’ll transcribe whatever you say and lay it over the video like subtitles. This sounds handy, but it works about as well as any other voice transcription works, which is not particularly well. Thankfully, you can jump in and edit those captions if you need to. Next up, you can tap the three circles icon to apply a few traditional video filters that alter the general appearance of a video. You can change filters on a clip-by-clip basis, so if you have a few different video clips in a row, they don’t all have to have the same filter. Advertisement If you tap the star icon, you’ll find a sticker system where you can overlay a handful of symbols. This conveniently includes a page with your most used emoji as well. Oddly, that’s it. Just your most used emoji. You can tap one at random to insert it into a video, then double tap the emoji to edit it, but that’s a bizarre way to do things to say the least. Finally, you can also add title cards by tapping the T icon, and a soundtrack by tapping the music note icon. It doesn’t look like it at first, but you can edit the title cards to say whatever you want. Just pick the visual style you want to use, then tap the text to change it. Once you’re done making a video, you can export it or send it over to a friend. Videos are limited to a square format, but there’s beyond that there’s quite a bit you can do here, though the learning curve is surprisingly high for an app that’s marketed for its simplicity. In an effort to keep things simple, Apple Clips ditches a lot of traditional UI elements, which means for the first 10 or 15 minutes of using it, you’ll be blindly tapping icons and swiping around the screen trying to figure out how it all works. Sponsored If you happen to get things right on the first attempt, Apple Clips seems like a fun tool, but the second you try and actually edit something it all falls apart into a baffling mess of random taps. For example, if you’re editing a section of a video, you can easily add transcription, filters, or stickers. But I have no idea how to get back to the main video timeline screen to add in music or titles unless I back all the way to main start screen. The whole thing just feels incredibly unintuitive. Perhaps once you take the time to learn how Apple Clips works, then learn all the limitations, you can start making good videos. That’s assuming you want to take the time to do so.

When the news was announced, the British firm said in a statement it expected Apple to push ahead with plans to develop its own mobile graphics chip. But it also said it would be "extremely challenging [for Apple] to design a brand new GPU architecture from basics without infringing its intellectual property rights, accordingly Imagination does not accept Apple’s assertions." Related: iPhone 8 Now, however, it seems Apple remains undeterred, posting job adverts for roles in its “UK Design Centre” working on graphics unit design. The company will likely be looking to take staff from Imagination Technologies which relies on Apple for more than half its revenues. As the Telegraph reports, it seems 25 former Imagination staff left the British firm for Apple in the past two years, including former chief operating officer, John Metcalfe. Based on the new job postings, Apple will be looking to replace Imagination's technology with its own tech, with the advertised roles focused on designing and supporting the company's graphics architecture. According to Imagination's statement following the announcement of Apple's withdrawal, Cupertino aims to produce its own graphics chip, which will likely appear in iPhones and iPads, within two years. Though legal action hasn't been ruled out, Imagination claims it is discussing "potential alternative commercial arrangements” with Apple, so the two firms could still come to some sort of agreement before next year.

Contributed Christopher Martin (right) welcomes Michelle Williams of VP Records. Contributed Randy Chin 1 2 3 4 In a bold step into the streaming world, veteran record label VP Records recently signed on as one of Apple Music's curators of music and will now possess the ability to promote its own specially curated playlists through Apple. The record label, which has dedicated decades to the promotion of reggae, dancehall, and soca music abroad, is now expected to create specific playlists geared at serving the interests of music lovers not only in the Caribbean, but globally. The label will also use the platform to introduce music lovers to some new tracks while creating a more intimate connection through its carefully crafted playlists. The Apple Music playlists, personally curated by VP Records A&Rs, will include some of the most current dancehall, soca, and reggae music, as well as rare reggae tracks that are a part of the label's catalogue. The partnership between VP Records and Apple Music, is part of a new movement by the label to tap into the streaming wave that has taken over the music industry internationally. Jamaica and other Caribbean islands have been lagging behind in terms of sales since the vinyl industry dip gave way to digital music. "We are really thrilled to have the opportunity to work with Apple to be a voice for reggae and Caribbean music on Apple Music. We're actively working with curators, which will include everybody from guest artistes and DJs to our very own veteran A&Rs, as well as influencers in the industry. The idea is simply to offer a selection of playlists that will exhibit the diversity and history that exists in the genre. We also hope to provide more exposure to all the artistes who are working so hard to expand the music's reach worldwide," Randy Chin, VP Records, told The Sunday Gleaner. At present, only the likes of Shaggy, Bob Marley, Chris Martin, and Charly Black have managed to stand out for reggae music in the world of streaming. Charly Black's Billboard-charting single, Gyal You A Party Animal, recently smashed through the 100 million plays mark on Spotify. Prior to this, only Bob Marley's Three Little Birds with 133 million, and Shaggy's pop effort, It Wasn't Me with 130 million, had crossed the 100 million mark on the streaming platform.   New frontier   Aaron Talbert, vice-president of sales and marketing for VP Records, also weighed in on the importance of streaming to the modern module of selling and sharing music as he sees creating or joining streaming subscription services as the new wave taking the music forward. "Streaming is the new frontier for the music business. This technology has opened up a large number of markets fo the distribution of music content that were limited to the physical product or digital delivery via downloads. As serious music fans discover the option for the full range of high quality, new catalogues and exclusive content through Apple or other services, there will be a natural attraction to subscription services to hear music. Meanwhile, free streaming outlets like YouTube are already so popular, the model for streaming music (video) has already saturated the reggae market," he said.

The company has had to adapt its digital offerings over the past few years by releasing its own music streaming service to compete with the likes of Spotify, Pandora, and others. While Apple has done its best to secure exclusives with artists over the past year or so, there are also things that it cannot control, like when an artist no longer wants to continue to offer their music on the service. While this kind of thing is rare, that seems to be the case with Jay Z, as the artist has now pulled a majority of his albums from Apple Music and also Spotify. There hasn't been an official announcement from the artist as to why his catalog was pulled, but Spotify did clarify that it was done so at the artist's request. Jay Z is a co-owner of music streaming service Tidal, along with a dozen or so other high profile artists. There is speculation that he has pulled most of his catalog from major rival services to make it an exclusive offering to the service he owns. Oddly, the albums still remain on Google's music streaming service for the time being.

According to the report, 26 percent of potential Android buyers looking to upgrade their devices in 2017 list Xiaomi as their preferred brand.

But one bitcoin expert says that's bogus. The Turkish Crime Family grabbed headlines last month by claiming they had the stolen login credentials for more than 700 million icloud.com, me.com and mac.com accounts. They demanded increasing ransoms from Apple while threatening to wipe the data from devices connected to the affected accounts if it did not. On Friday, the hackers tweeted that they had been paid US$480,000 in bitcoin. As proof, the group posted a link showing a transaction on Blockchain.info, a popular bitcoin wallet. “We were told by our negotiator that we have come to a final agreement with Apple,” the hacking group tweeted prior to receiving the payment. However, the hackers actually tweeted out a transaction to an "internal treasury operation at a bitcoin exchange," according to Jonathan Levin, co-founder at Chainalysis, a provider of anti-money laundering software for bitcoin. "We have positively identified that the inputs and outputs of that transaction are controlled by a single bitcoin exchange," Levin said in an email. The transaction was part of an internal money deposit process at a Korean bitcoin exchange, he said. Apple didn’t respond to a request for comment. The tech giant has said that it never suffered any such breach. The stolen login credentials that the hackers obtained appeared to come from breaches at other third-party services, Apple said. Security researchers suspect that's true, and they believe the Turkish Crime Family has exaggerated its hacking claims. The hacking group also didn't respond to a request for comment. ​CIO Executive Council member profile: Emmanuel Steve Dulvin More from CIO Executive Council Join the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

Never Bounce clarifies that Apple sticks to their statement that no security breaches have ever happened to their system specifically on iCloud and Apple IDs. Moreover, a free online email list verifier can help Apple device users to eliminate scammers an   Why Neverbounce Email Verification Tool is the Best (EMAILWIRE.COM, April 09, 2017 ) OH, USA ---- Is your email list safe enough to prevent hackers from breaking in? News from papers and the internet nowadays is always full of stories and issues regarding cyber criminals. And these cyber criminals are not an ordinary group of criminals because they can be called a genius in some way. Cyber criminals like hackers are computer geeks who break into computer systems, websites, and personal email accounts. These cyber criminals never mess with organizations and high-profile peoples email accounts for the sake of killing their boredom. They do it for money and fame. Hackers love to feed on peoples fear and gossips. They love hearing and reading stories about them because they use it to get an easier access to national and international front pages of news. As a matter of fact, even one of the biggest technology companies like Apple was said to be invaded by hackers too. Is it time to add some security in your accounts and use a free online email list verifier? Never Bounce has gathered information that a hacker or perhaps a group of hackers were able to breach the security of Apple. The group of hackers that called themselves as the Turkish Crime Family said that they were able to get an access to Apples large cache of email accounts and iCloud. Thinking the millions and millions of people all over the world are using an Apple device in their everyday lives as a form of communication and medium for business transactions, the public is all eyes and ears about this issue. According to one of the hackers, he/she just wants his/her money. They demand that Apple company pay them a ransom of $75000 worth of Ethereum or Bitcoin which are both a popular cryptocurrency. However, the group laid another demand which are iTunes gift cards worth $100000. Never Bounce confirmed that the latest demand was made by hackers in exchange for deleting all their claimed access to a large cache of data. The hackers even posted a video on YouTube showing how they can easily open an iCloud account that came from their list of emails. The report of Motherboard said that the total number of emails that hackers stories were inconsistent. One of them claimed that they have more than 300 million while another one claimed that they have exactly 559 million emails on their list. However, Never Bounce clarifies that Apple sticks to their statement that no security breaches have ever happened to their system specifically on iCloud and Apple IDs. Thus, Never Bounce emphasizes that all Apple device users can relax but still, they have to take extra precautions themselves. Using a free online email list verifier can help them eliminate scammers and suspicious emails that try to get in their systems.

By Hayley Tsukayama / The Washington Post Apple this week announced some minor upgrades to its Mac Pro desktop computer, which it says will be followed by a major overhaul of its high-end Mac. It’s been four years since Apple announced any sort of update for the computer, leading some to worry that the company — which famously worked to usher in a “post-PC” era — was letting mobile overshadow the humble desktop. But as Apple’s announcement proves, we may not see desktops die completely, even in an era when mobile devices are our most-used gadgets. What may happen, however, is that desktop computers take on a new form. Judging by what companies have been trying lately to keep excitement alive in desktops, consumers may see the companies shift from affordable computers that can work in every home to higher-end, more specialized machines. There’s no denying desktops have been on the decline. Sales growth for computers, particularly desktops, has been sliding since 2012, according to consulting firm IDC. A recent study showed that Android overtook Windows as the world’s most-used operating system overall. A similar thing happened with Apple in 2012 when its mobile operating system, iOS, was logged as getting more usage than Apple’s desktop operating system as consumers turned more to their iPhones, iPads and iPods. Basically, desktops have seen their main functions eroded by an army of new devices. Need a big keyboard on which to type? There’s a cheap laptop, or a Bluetooth keyboard, for that. Want to stream an online movie? You can do that straight from your TV. But the truth is that we may never go truly “post-PC” — or post-Mac, as the flurry of breathless articles over Apple’s plans for the Mac Pro indicated. There’s always going to be things for which we need a computer. In fact, Deloitte last year claimed in a study that even the youngest of millennials, those ages 18 to 24, are still relying on desktops and laptops a lot for specific tasks, including shopping, banking, watching video and creating text and image files. On top of that, companies are working to create desktops that fit into a world where mobile devices are increasingly doing most of the heavy lifting. For Apple, part of the solution seems to be making the Mac Pro more customizable, and therefore more flexible when it comes to fitting people’s needs. It’s also more closely marrying the mobile and desktop experiences. Craig Federighi, Apple’s senior vice president of software engineering, said that the company is working on making the iPad Pro work better with the desktop as a way to convince people that they still need both devices. Microsoft appears to be dealing with PC shifts by taking the best of mobile technology and bringing it to the desktop, often in big, beautiful fashion. The Surface Studio, a 28-inch touch screen desktop computer that’s also $3,000, lets you use a stylus as well as a dial that Microsoft designed just for this touch screen. Samsung is trying to make your desk completely mobile-based. The company this month showed off a desktop mode for its upcoming Galaxy S8 phones, which lets you plug your phone into a $150 dock and use it with a monitor, keyboard and mouse for a more desktop-like experience. It’s the kind of product that, in theory, that could kill the desktop as a widespread device. But it will take some time for mobile solutions like this to take off because they’re still a little bit rough around the edges, said Gartner analyst Mikako Kitagawa. “The reality of putting your small device onto your large screen is that you have to adjust screen size and applications to fit. Those little subtle changes are hectic, and it’s not realistic to use them,” she said. So, judging by how the desktop market has evolved over the past several years — and where it’s headed — the upshot seems to be that you’ll probably be spending more for a desktop, but possibly using it for fewer things. Kitagawa said that, in her opinion, desktops will settle at around the $800-$1,000 range for consumers who don’t want the high-end machines that you’d see in a professional setting, but want the power for gaming, video and photo editing or other hobbies. “That’s going to be the sweet spot,” she said.   Most Read Everett considering dress code for espresso stand workers EVERETT — The days may be numbered for bikini baristas who make… Apr 8th, 2017 by Scott North Stalled cleanup of former mill site stalls development, sale EVERETT — A dispute over cleanup plans at Kimberly-Clark’s former mill site… Apr 9th, 2017 by Chris Winters and Dan Catchpole Chakra bowls help people connect to their inner selves EVERETT — To sing, each bowl needs a different touch.

It can also be one of its most confusing. By the very nature of how it works, it’s hard to suss out exactly what 3D Touch can do for you as an iPhone user. After all, it’s not like iOS or Apple does a great job of advertising the feature’s capabilities. However, once you get a handle on all its myriad functions, you’ll find that 3D Touch can help simplify and make more efficient many of the everyday actions you complete with your iPhone. What follows are some of the best ways to use 3D Touch to be more efficient with your Apple smartphone. How-to use 3D Touch to slay notifications For the better part of a decade, notifications were a nightmare on iOS. But with the release iOS 10 and the introduction of several 3D Touch specific shortcuts, it’s now possible to get a handle on notifications with ease. Most iOS users likely know that you can use 3D touch to act upon notifications, whether on the lock screen or notification shade, by pressing down on them. Depending on the app in question, you have several options. For instance, in the case of Gmail, pressing down on an email notification allows the user to archive the message, write a response without leaving the notification or reply to everyone in the email thread. Less know is the fact that you can clear all your notifications in one go with 3D Touch. To do so: 1. Pull down the notification shade. 2. Apply pressure to the ‘X’ icon to the right of the “Recent” header. 3.  After a second, a “Clear all Notifications” shortcut will appear. Tap it to clear all your notifications. How-to use 3D Touch with Control Center to access even more functionality With the release of iOS 10, Apple reworked the operating system’s Control Center, the small panel devoted to device settings and media playback you can pull up by swiping up from the bottom of your device’s screen, to make it more organized. Along the bottom of the Control Center are four icons that allow you to use your phone as a flashlight, as well as quickly access the Clock, Calculator and Camera apps. If you use 3D Touch on the flashlight icon, you can adjust how much light the iPhone’s flash module emits when used as a flashlight. Meanwhile, if you apply pressure to the Timer icon, you can quickly set a one hour, 20 minute, 5 minute or one minute timer. Using 3D Touch on the calculator icon allows one to copy the last to the iPhone’s internal clipboard. Lastly, using 3D Touch on the camera icon lets you jump straight to the taking pictures using either of the iPhone’s two main cameras. You can also use this same shortcut to jump straight to the camera’s slow motion and video capture functionality. Use 3D Touch to prioritize downloads By now, most people know that they can use 3D Touch on almost any app to quickly access certain functionality within said app, but it turns out you can also use 3D Touch on apps iOS is in the process of downloading. When you do so, you’re given the option to cancel the download, pause it or prioritize it. The last one is especially useful if you’ve just setup a new iPhone and need access to one app in particular as soon as possible. How-to use 3D Touch to make selecting and editing text easier In my opinion, this next tip is one of 3D Touch’s most useful applications; it allows you to quickly and accurately select and edit text using a trackpad. To activate iOS 10’s trackpad 1. Launch an app and bring up the keyboard. 2. Press down firmly on the keyboard. 3. Drag your finger along the keyboard to move the cursor. 4. Bonus tip: You can press down anywhere on the keyboard to launch trackpad mode. However, I find bringing up the trackpad is the fastest if you press down on the spacebar. It’s also possible to use the virtual trackpad select text. To do so, slightly reduce and then reapply the pressure to the keyboard. It can take a bit of practice to execute properly, so be patient if it doesn’t work at first. How-to use 3D Touch to access an app’s functionality from the home screen If you’ve tried to use 3D Touch before, you’ll likely know that a lot of third-party apps allow you to jump to specific parts of their interface and functionality by pressing down on their homescreen icon. With the Air Canada app, for instance, you can jump straight to its check-in screen using 3D Touch. That said, some of the most useful home screen actions come courtesy of Apple’s own first-party apps. For example, if you push down on the settings app, you can quickly jump to the Wi-Fi, battery and Bluetooth menus, making this is a great way to enable iOS’s powerful low power mode and switch between Wi-Fi networks on and off on the fly. Another great place to use 3D Touch on is the App Store icon. It gives you the option to update to jump to the app’s search and update functionality. How to use 3D Touch to switch between apps 1. Press down on the left side of the screen. 2. Wait until you see your most recently used app peeks from behind the home screen. 3. Quickly move your finger to right side of the screen. 4. Repeat the past three steps to switch back to your next most recently used app. You can also use 3D Touch to access iOS’s multi-tasking menu. Many of the same steps above apply here. 1. Press down on the left side of the screen. 2. Wait until you see your most recently used app peek from behind the home screen and continue holding on the screen. 3. Use the multi-tasking menu as you normally would, swiping through the list to find the app you want to use. Given that you can also access the multi-tasking menu by double tapping the home button, I find this to be one of the less useful 3D Touch shortcuts. However, you find you prefer to access the iPhone’s app switcher this way if you own the iPhone 7.

Who will innovate now that Apple and Google can claim as their own. Mr Dog No one gave it a chance cause it was so late to the game ciderrules 3D Touch on the Phone icon brings up your top 4 favorites to quick dial – this is one I use regularly. Microsoft Office Apps bring up the last 3 documents you have opened for quick access. The trackpad is very useful as you can see where the cursor is (which can be difficult using the older method with the zoomed in bubble as the cursor is under your finger). Overall I find 3D Touch very useful. So much better than long pres (which is still there for lesser used functions).

Home Contact Advertise About RSS @PowerPage @JasonOGrady Apple releases iOS 10.3.1 update, offers bug fixes, security fixes Posted by: Chris Barylick Date: Tuesday, April 4th, 2017, 05:36 Category: Hack, iOS, iPad, iPhone, iPod Touch, News, security, Software After a major OS update come the fixes. Apple on Monday released iOS 10.3.1, an update available for its iOS devices available as an over-the-air update or when connected to iTunes via a Mac or Windows PC. The update, which weighs in at just under 30 megabytes as an OTA download, resolves issues such as a hardware-specific problem wherein iPhone 5 and iPhone 5c handsets had trouble updating over the air. The 5 and 5c were Apple’s last iPhone models with a 32-bit processor, the A6. Since the iPhone 5s all iOS devices have turned to 64-bit technology. Apple is in the process of phasing out 32-bit support, and indeed the iOS 10.3.2 beta appears to omit it entirely. Among the core changes introduced in iOS 10.3 was the switch to the Apple File System, which is better optimized for flash storage. In some cases, the switch restored gigabytes of storage space to the device. The update addresses bugs, offers security updates and also resolves a vulnerability that would let hackers run attacks through a device’s Wi-Fi chip. If you’ve installed iOS 10.3.1 and have any feedback to offer, please let us know what you make of it in the comments.

Bruised fruits taste great used in the cart’s signature apple fritters (left). U.S. Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis once described states as the nation’s “laboratories of democracy” for driving innovation on social and economic policy. The same could be said about the impact of mobile vendors on Madison’s food scene. Food carts are operated by entrepreneurs looking to carve out a niche in a notoriously difficult industry. With more carts making their way to the streets each year, vendors need to creatively distinguish themselves in a crowded field. Quality ingredients, healthy entrees, inspiration from regional cuisines and local sourcing set these five carts apart. Local produce Laurel Burleson opened Ugly Apple last fall as most carts were heading into winter hibernation. She specializes in breakfast, serving apple fritters, oatmeal, muffins, biscuit sandwiches and market frittatas, which change each week depending on what local produce is available. As spring vegetables start to trickle in from local farms, the menu will diversify. Burleson is committed to sourcing produce that tastes good but is on its way to the compost heap only because it lacks aesthetic appeal. “I still get some strange looks from farmers when I ask, ‘Hey, do you have anything you don’t want to sell? Will you sell it to me?” says Burleson. “Lately, it’s been a lot of squash and rutabaga. But what I have heard from farmers is that when spring takes off, I should be able to buy some overstock vegetables, the stuff that’s left over at the end of the day and is probably not worth bringing back the next week.” This year, Ugly Apple is parked at the corner of Wisconsin Avenue and Mifflin Street on Tuesday, Thursdays and Fridays 7-10 a.m.. On Wednesdays, the cart heads to the west side to vend at University Research Park. × Expand Carolyn Fath Daniel and Leticia Hernandez do Mexican the Cali way with their shrimp taco (left). A touch of California Wife-and-husband team Leticia and Daniel Hernandez have settled into a nice groove with their cart, Cali Fresh, located on the Library Mall. This will be the third year Cali Fresh will vend on campus. The couple took some time off this winter but were back in action by mid-February serving taqueria-style tacos, burritos, quesadillas and chalupas. Leticia says the cart’s cuisine is true to its name, blending traditional Mexican fare with California street food. “[The menu] comes from a family background in restaurants. For me, it was all authentic Mexican growing up,” says Leticia. “Daniel is from California. He used to have a job where he’d travel up and down the state. So there’s definitely inspiration from all these little places he visited on the road.” California natives seem to recognize the Golden State’s influence on Cali Fresh’s menu — it’s unique among Madison’s Mexican carts in its daily offering of a shrimp taco (its best seller) and shrimp quesadilla. It also offers a vegan taco based on roasted cauliflower. Leticia says they have quite a few regulars who keep coming back for a reminder of home. “When we first started selling at Library Mall, it was a shock just how many students were from California,” says Leticia. × Expand Linda Falkenstein Yes, this is homemade pasta. It’s headed to delicious bowls at Common Pasta, served up by co-owner Brian Baur (right). Housemade pasta One food cart that braved it through most of the winter was Common Pasta. Chef-owners Brian Baur and Thomas Durbin say they were pleasantly surprised that business turned out to be just as brisk as the weather. Common Pasta has been vending on campus, 1025 W. Johnson St., since it opened last fall. The cart’s spicy mac and cheese has proved popular no matter the season. “We start cooking at six in the morning, extrude all of our pasta off-site, bake fresh bread and make the sauces every morning,” says Baur. “It’s always been important to us that we don’t cut corners. We prepare each pasta to order in a pan just as we would in a restaurant. I’m pretty sure we are the only food cart with a six-burner stove.” In mid-April, Common Pasta will join the crowd of carts on Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard. There, downtown lunch-goers can expect to see short rib ragu, pesto (made with basil and kale), and mac and cheese, as well as rotating specials. Last month, the cart served lumache pasta with smoked tomato sauce, parmigiano reggiano and spicy Italian sausage. Another recent special was spaghetti and meatballs. “We’re trying to make the best-quality pasta you can get for eight dollars in the city,” says Baur. “I think we’re doing it.” A sea salt caramel — also made fresh daily by Baur and Durbin — is complimentary with every dish. × Expand Good Food Melanie Nelson (right) focuses on a good-for-you menu at the two Good Food carts. Thai tacos (left) come wrapped in lettuce. Carbs, crushed Serving the healthiest food possible has been Melanie Nelson’s mission since opening Good Food in 2010. It turned out to be a winning strategy, enough to warrant the opening of a second cart, Good Food II in 2014. This season, Nelson is taking her healthy cuisine to a new level. “I’ve been learning about the metabolic disasters that can result from too much sugar. And pretty much everyone is eating too much sugar,” says Nelson. “I was seeing sugar everywhere I looked. The dried cranberries, the candied walnuts, the peanut sauce, even the balsamic vinaigrette had honey in it. I couldn’t do it anymore. So I decided to revamp the whole menu to go low carb.” The new menu still has six items that can be served as a salad or in a wheat flour tortilla wrap. Low-carb versions of old favorites like the Caesar Supreme and Lunchtime in Albuquerque are on the menu. New additions include a citrus-avocado-kale mix that features chopped pink grapefruit and oranges tossed with kale, diced avocado, pickled red onions, salted sunflower seeds, crumbled feta and citrus vinaigrette. The option of adding grilled chicken or tofu is also still available. “We took away all the honey. All the frozen orange juice concentrate. All the added sugar. The idea is to make everything 30 net carbs or less. A lot of the items are much less than that,” says Nelson. “We still use some fruit and I’ve started using stevia as a sweetener.” Nelson has also introduced a new method of delivery for her entree salads: lettuce tacos (it’s built like a tortilla wrap, only the salad is rolled in a lettuce leaf). Good Food I cart is staying at its spot in front of Walgreens on East Main Street this year. Good Food II will return to the Library Mall. In April, Nelson’s new brick-and-mortar restaurant — Good Food Low Carb Cafe — is set to open at 4674 Cottage Grove Road. × Expand Ladonia Cafe Amie Swanson of Ladonia Cafe (right) focuses on fresh flavors, with her roasted sweet potato tamales, pinto beans, organic brown rice and fresh housemade salsa. Alternative proteins Ladonia Cafe’s Amie Swanson doesn’t plan on changing her menu much this season. Ladonia will continue to serve staples like the tamale platter, BLT sandwich (made with meat-free, tempeh “bacon”) and quinoa salad. All items sold at the cart are vegan, and most are gluten free. But Swanson doesn’t make a big deal out of it. “Shh....I’m a secret vegan,” says Swanson. “Over 80 percent of my customers aren’t vegan or even vegetarian.” But Swanson says her customers don’t care if her food happens to be animal-free; they come back because the food is “fresh, tastes great and is satisfying.” “I try to balance all the meals I put out with some protein,” says Swanson. “I’ve had some roasted vegetable sandwiches that taste good, but afterwards I was still hungry. That’s because it didn’t have a protein.” Swanson offers occasional specials. She’s also developing a new salad that she hopes will be on the regular menu soon. Street construction on the Capitol Square starting in April will temporarily relocate some food carts to nearby downtown locations. The Ladonia Cafe food cart, usually in front of 1 E. Main St., will move in front of the Madison Municipal Building until construction is complete in mid-summer.

Panoramics Photos Rec.humor.funny Joke Site Robocar Bog Twitter Best of Blog Brad's Home Robocars.com Home » Topic » Robocars No, Detroit is not winning the robocar race. Submitted by brad on Mon, 2017-04-03 17:30. Robocars A new report from Navigant Research includes the chart shown below, ranking various teams on the race to robocar deployment. It’s causing lots of press headlines about how Ford is the top company and companies like Google and Uber are far behind. I elected not to buy the $3800 report, but based on the summary I believe their conclusions are ill founded to say the least. This ordering smacks of old-world car industry thinking. Saying that Ford and GM are ahead of Waymo/Google is like saying that Foxconn is ahead of Google or Apple in the smartphone market. Foxconn makes the iPhone of course, and makes lots of money at a modest profit margin of a few percent. Apple and Google don’t make their phones, they design them and the software platform. Ford and GM might feel good reading this report, but they should not. I do actually like Ford’s plan quite a bit — especially their declaration that they will not sell their robocar to end-users. I also like Daimler’s declaration that they want to have a taxi style service called “Car2Come” after their Car2Go one-way on-demand car rental service. (Americans giggle at the name, Germans are never bothered by such things. :-) GM does not belong high on the list, other than for its partnership with Lyft. They were wise to acquire a company like Cruise — and I know the folks at Cruise, this is not a criticism of them — but it’s not enough to catapult you to the front of the list. A similar article came out a few months ago, declaring that Silicon Valley was sure to lose to Detroit, because Detroit knows how to make cars, and Silicon Valley doesn’t. The report went further and declared that Google was falling behind because they had said they did not plan to make a car. The author had mistakenly thought Google had plans to make a car — Google never said anything like that — and so decided that the announcement that they would not make one was a big retreat on their part. Companies like Google, Apple and Uber have never stated they wished to make cars, or felt they were any good at it. If they want to make cars, they have the cash to go buy a car company, but there is no need to do that. There are a couple of dozen companies around the world who are already very good at making cars, and if you come to them with an order for 100,000 cars to your specification, they will jump to say “yes, sir!” Some of the companies, the big leaders like Toyota or BMW, might well refuse that order, not wanting to be the supplier for a threat to their existence. But it won’t help them. Somebody will be that supplier. If not a German, Japanese or U.S. company, then a Korean company, or failing that a Chinese company. In fact, Foxconn has said it is interested in making cars, and Apple is designing them, so the Apple-Foxconn relationship may be far more than a metaphor for this situation. When you summon an Uber, you don’t care what nameplate is on the car. When you summon UberSelect, you don’t care if it’s Lexus, or Mercedes or BMW. Uber was your brand, and you aren’t buying the car for 15 years, you are buying it for 15 minutes. Brand plays a completely different role. Companies like Waymo, Apple, Uber, Zoox and others would be foolish to manufacture cars, unless they want a car so radically different that nobody knows how to make it. (Then, they might decide to be the first to figure it out.) The car manufacturers would be foolish to turn down the giant purchase order, or partnerships with whoever has the best technology. The winner of the transportation game of the future will be the company that thinks outside the car. That doesn’t mean the big car companies can’t do that. It’s just harder for them to do. The chart’s not entirely wrong. Honda is pretty far behind — but PSA is even further behind. BMW, Daimler and Ford are among the best of the car companies, but Tesla and Volvo deserve higher ranking. Hyundai is not ahead of Toyota, and Tesla, while not ahead of Waymo, is in a pretty good place. Bosch is a surprising absentee from the list. FCA should be on it, just very low on the chart, along with the smaller Japanese vendors and many Chinese vendors. But be clear. Making the car is essential, but it’s also old and a commodity. The value will lie in those building the self-driving software systems and sensors, and those putting services together around the technologies. The big automaker’s advantages — nameplate and reputation, reliability, manufacturing skill and capacity, retail channel experience — these are all less valuable or commoditized. They have to act fast to move to new business models that will make it in the future. Of course, one plan is to own the important components I name above, and several companies like BMW, Daimler, Ford, Nissan and Volvo are trying to do that. But they’re behind Waymo by a fair distance. » brad's blog My bet is Tesla is leading the race Submitted by Alnair (not verified) on Tue, 2017-04-04 02:16. Because autonomous driving is based on machine learning algorithms (similar to algorithms that use Google for the search engine) and provided the most data you have, the better result you get from those algorithms, a company that delivers 100K cars/year (soon 300K) with all hardware for autonomous driving capable to work in shadow mode gathering data from all his costumers around the world will soon overpass all the competition by large. That company is Tesla. I no doubt Waymo will be the best autonomous car in Palo Alto roads, but world is much more diverse and to learn all possible scenarios you need hundreds of thousands cars, not just hundreds. » reply Often said Submitted by brad on Tue, 2017-04-04 09:05. But if you go around the industry and ask the question, “Which company is the clear leader in machine learning and neural network technologies?” The answer will almost universally be “Google.” So do you really imagine that Tesla would be so far ahead of Waymo on that?

Home Contact Advertise About RSS @PowerPage @JasonOGrady Rumor: Apple orders 70 million OLED units from Samsung for next-gen iPhone Posted by: Chris Barylick Date: Tuesday, April 4th, 2017, 05:37 Category: Hardware, iPhone, Processors, Rumor, Samsung A company doesn’t buy 70 million components unless you’re probably going to include it in a future product. Apple has reportedly placed an order for 70 million OLED panels from Samsung, which looks to be set to become Apple’s sold OLED supplier. Demand for the 2017 iPhone, which is expected to feature a major design overhaul with an edge-to-edge display, glass body, and a premium price tag, is expected to be high as it typically is in a year when a new look is unveiled. Apple and Samsung are gearing up to meet demand with the large panel order. The story is followed by the following comment from IHS Markit analyst David Hsieh: “Apple has ordered 70 million units of OLED panels from Samsung this year, while Samsung is preparing to churn out as many as 95 million for Apple in 2017, in case demand exceeds expectations.” It’s rumored that the OLED panels will be in short supply come the next-gen iPhone’s launch in September, with the majority of the stock unavailable until later in the year. Hsieh has stated that “it is also possible that some of these 70 million handsets will not be shipped to customers this year and be carried over to next year depending on demand.” An anonymous source also stated that the next-gen iPhone will feature a 5.2-inch screen and no home button, which will be sold alongside standard 4.7 and 5.5-inch devices with LCD screens and home buttons. All three iPhones will include wireless charging functionality (lately said to be inductive) and waterproofing, while at least one model, presumably the OLED iPhone, will include a 3D sensor that supports facial recognition. Other rumored features include improvements to the camera, a faster and more efficient A11 processor, Touch ID built into the display, True Tone ambient light adjustment, and perhaps augmented reality functionality enabled through the camera. As always, stay tuned for additional details as they become available.

Home Contact Advertise About RSS @PowerPage @JasonOGrady Recently published patent application shows how Apple might incorporate Touch Bar, Touch ID functions into next-gen Magic Keyboard Posted by: Chris Barylick Date: Wednesday, April 5th, 2017, 05:02 Category: Hardware, MacBook Pro, News, Patents, Rumor, Touch Bar, Touch ID Apple may be looking to bring both the Touch ID and Touch Bar features to an updated version of the Magic Keyboard. A new Apple patent application, or at least some form of the application, shows a device may also include a processing unit positioned within the housing, and a primary display positioned at least partially within the housing and configured to display a graphical-user interface executed by the processing unit. In some embodiments, the display is an organic light-emitting diode display. The electronic device may be a keyboard device. This change would address one of the main concerns expressed about the Touch Bar on the 2016 MacBook Pro, in that its advantages would become moot if the user were using an external keyboard.

The fad gadget you strap to your wrist has seen a precipitous fall in the last year. Pebble closed its doors after releasing a solid fitness tracker, and Fitbit has struggled (though we liked its new Fitbit Alta HR). There's also the fact that fitness trackers, while great for athletes, seem to not actually help most of us lose weight. Image: Fitbit Which means if you're desperate to track sleep or steps or how many calories you consume you might be better off sticking to your phone. If you've taken a dive into your phone's fitness apps lately, you'll have noticed it can track your steps, your runs, and even your sleep without any help. So really, what's the point of buying yourself a separate wearable? Maybe your phone is enough tracker Image: Apple All contemporary smartphones come packed with sensors, which help it sort out where you are on a map, what orientation you're holding the phone in, and so on. It turns out these tiny components can do a lot of fitness tracking, too. Both Google Fit and Apple Health, depending on your choice of OS, are capable of keeping tabs on the steps you've taken, the distance you've covered, and the calories you've burned as you make your way about your day. Image: Google Google Fit is the more fitness focused of the two platforms, as its name suggests. Try adding an activity and you get a hundred to choose from, including everything from water polo to backcountry skiing. A lot of these activities can only be tracked in a very loose way, but the options to record them are there. Apple Health gives a more rounded picture of your health, and while it doesn't have quite as many activity categories as its Google counterpart, it goes into more detail and depth. For example, it includes the option of tracking caffeine intake and glucose levels. Image: Strava What apps do you need to turn you phone into a tracker? You don't necessarily need another device to keep tabs on a lot of these extra measurements, but you do need extra apps. There's a pile of apps, from Strava to Runkeeper, that can measure walks, runs, and bike rides using only your mobile phone, and in a lot more depth than your phone's own software can. (Both Strava and Runkeeper can share data with either Google Fit or Apple Health if necessary.) Image: Sleep As Android And an app such as Instant Heart Rate Monitor (for iOS or Android) can measure your heart rate using the technology built into your phone's camera. It might not be as accurate or as comprehensive as using a device strapped to your wrist or your chest, but it can add new depths to your health tracking, and the apps come with plenty of useful options for analysis and assessment. Apps can use your phone's sensors to figure out just how much quality shuteye you're getting as well. Sleep as Android can judge how restful for night has been for Android, while Sleep Cycle is one of the best options for iPhones or iPads. That's a lot of data you can keep on top of using nothing but your phone and a well-chosen app or two, though admittedly, there's more manual input involved if you want to go beyond the basics of step counts and sleep times, and it will definitely drain your phone's battery a little faster. Yet, as your phone is usually always with you, you may not need that separate tracker. Why you might still want a fitness tracker Image: Fitbit If you do decide to pay extra for a dedicated fitness tracker, the first benefit you get is portability: you don't have to lug a 15cm phone around on your morning jog, because a snug wristband or a tracker clipped to your pocket is doing all the tracking for you. With many smartwatches now including GPS, you can track your location too. Smartphones might feel like extensions of our natural bodies these days, but for some high-intensity activities you really don't want to take your phone with you. From running around on a soccer pitch to doing laps of the pool, the more advanced your fitness activity, the more a dedicated tracker starts to make sense. Image: Alex Cranz/Gizmodo And by fitness tracker we also mean smartwatch with advanced fitness tracking capabilities — being able to glance at your wrist as you hit the home straight of a 5K run is much more convenient than trying to fish your phone our of your pocket. The latest fitness trackers also bring more sensors and more accurate sensors to the table: whether it's the continuous heart rate tracking of the Apple Watch or the altimeter, barometer, and compass built into the Garmin Fenix 3, you can usually expand on the monitoring capabilities of your phone with a dedicated wearable. Image: Alex Cranz/Gizmodo That often translates into less time spent manually inputting data — if there's one sticking point likely to interfere with your fitness tracking goals, it's having to enter data manually. It's a job that just never gets done, or doesn't get done often enough, and you don't have to worry about it if you're wearing a device that knows the difference between a gym session and a jog without being told. Of course there are a wide range of fitness trackers out there, some of which do a better job than others at keeping tabs on what you're doing, but generally speaking you get more automation and more detail with an extra device to help your phone along. Image: Alex Cranz/Gizmodo And all that's before you get to the app and software that comes with your tracker, which you may well prefer to the built-in offerings from Apple and Google — Fitbit's bundled app is particularly handy and gives you a detailed breakdown of your stats on the web as well as on your phone. The big downside to a fitness tracker? It's another gadget you'll need to be charging every day (or week), and the majority of trackers are big ugly rubber bands. Those are nearly as aesthetically pleasing as a smartphone in your back pocket. Originally published on Gizmodo Australia.

Experts have since said amputations may have been wrongly blamed on a spider bite, and authorities now consider a bacterial infection to be responsible for the man’s injuries. Despite this, the damage to the largely harmless white-tail may have been done.

"Starting with iOS 10.3, Apple has started alerting users when they open a 32-bit app on iOS. The pop up notification reads that the app must be updated by the developer or else it may not work with future versions of iOS," tech website 9to5mac.com reported on Monday. The tech giant started supporting 64-bit applications with the launch of the iPhone 5s in September 2013. The company also asked developers to submit new apps with 64-bit support since February 2015 and app updates starting June 2015. Last month, Apple has officially released iOS 10.3 update that has major updates regarding its newly launched AirPods, WiFi calling and SiriKit. Other minor updates include new security features and a new iCloud section under the Apple ID Settings menu. The new section shows a breakdown of cloud storage usage. This feature also shows which apps use iCloud. --IANS anuj/sm/vm SEARCH More from Sify: talking point on sify news Latest Features No bars on highways Rare April snow, heavy rains cut off Kashmir Dalai Lama's Arunachal visit rattles China, jubilates exiled Buddhists Cartoon: Aadhar everywhere!

Hannah Horvath is moving on from her life in New York: The lead character in HBO's Girls, which is calling time on the series after six seasons, decides to raise her coming baby in a quieter and less raucous environment than the Big Apple (Alison Williams and Lena Dunham pictured) After being offered a position at the school, which extends a teaching position to the writer based solely off of her experience in publishing online, Hannah seeks the advice of her squad. However, she has been purposely left out of a party thrown by Shoshanna, which sees the rest of the group on the invite list. Shoshanna is getting married and the celebration is an engagement party.

The same goes for Netflix, Chevy pickups, wide-screen televisions and grocery store aisles stocked high with fresh fruit and vegetables. But for some reason, we hate the one entity that brought all these things within reach of most Americans: Wall Street. Our way of life would not be remotely possible without the interstitial role played by Wall Street. It’s the left ventricle of capitalism. Yet Wall Street has become shorthand for everything that is wrong with the American economic system. And yes, Wall Street is partly to blame for its reputation. It constructed a black box around itself to keep what it does hidden from prying eyes. What happens there is not actually that complicated, but Wall Street wants you to think it is. Wall Street also exacerbated the 2008 financial crisis and was not held accountable. Worse, at the same time that American taxpayers bailed out big banks to the tune of trillions, Wall Street’s bankers, traders and executives helped themselves to billions in bonuses. As a result, one politician after another has lambasted Wall Street for every imaginable evil. Right after Wall Street CEOs helped themselves to those bonuses, President Barack Obama reminded some of them in a now-infamous April 2009 meeting that his administration was “the only thing between you and the pitchforks.” Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., has made a career of attacking high finance, going so far as to block Antonio Weiss, Obama’s nominee for Treasury undersecretary, from confirmation by the Senate merely because he worked on Wall Street. (Of course, she made no mention of the $1.6 million advance she received for her 2014 book, “A Fighting Chance,” a sum that would be inconceivable without Wall Street’s willingness to finance her publisher.) Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont based his entire presidential campaign on decrying Wall Street and the awful people who work there. And Hillary Clinton jumped all over Wall Street to secure the Democratic nomination – despite having taken some $10 million in speaking fees from financial firms after finishing her term as secretary of State. Perhaps the biggest hypocrite of them all, President Donald Trump criticized Wall Street to no end during his presidential campaign, only to then surround himself with Wall Street bankers and lawyers after winning the election. With so much sanctimony on the national stage, it’s easy to hate bankers. But if we want to actually fix what’s wrong with Wall Street, we will need to stop mindlessly villainizing it. Fair price In the most basic terms: Wall Street provides capital at a fair price to people who want it, by borrowing it from people who have it and want to invest it. It’s a simple service, and without it, we might as well go back to the Middle Ages, when people never ventured far from their tiny villages and spent their days worrying about their next meal. Wall Street put the internet at our collective fingertips. It’s the reason more than 160 million Americans have credit cards and access to an unsecured line of credit anytime they may want to use it. It democratized jet travel, which now allows average people to get halfway around the world in the time it used to take a fisherman to get his cod to market. Few people who have these things would be willing to give them up. The problem with Wall Street is its incentive and compensation system, which encourages bankers, traders and executives to take big risks with other people’s money. It rewards greed and recklessness without imposing accountability. This system was a main cause of the 2008 financial crisis. Wall Street bankers and traders were rewarded with huge bonuses for packaging shoddy mortgages that they knew, or should have known, would never be paid back into securities and selling them off as investments around the world. They did so because that’s exactly what they got paid to do. We need a new incentive system on Wall Street, one that encourages risk-taking, innovation and creativity, while also holding the people who work there accountable where it hurts – in their wallets – when things go wrong, as they inevitably will again. Trump and the Republicans in Congress seem determined to gut the financial regulations implemented after the financial crisis – the very rules designed to prevent another one from happening. In truth, the financial reform legislation is flawed. The length of the Dodd-Frank law alone, some 848 pages, is evidence of this, and so is the difficulty that small- and medium-sized businesses still have in getting access to capital. But this moment requires a scalpel, not a sledgehammer. Some provisions of Dodd-Frank are worth preserving, including requirements that banks have more capital. It’s a good thing that many complicated derivatives – financial bets on how the price of copper will move or whether a GE bond will default – are now traded on exchanges, where their prices can be more easily discovered. But other parts of the regulatory regime should be scrapped. For instance, it’s beyond ridiculous that one bank employee in five is tasked with monitoring what the other four do all day, and that big banks must endure the laborious and expensive annual process of creating “living wills” and withstanding “stress tests.” These are bureaucratic exercises with no practical usefulness. If a bank fails because of poor risk management, so be it. Let’s toss the notion of “too big to fail” into the dustbin of history, where it belongs. Although he has little political capital left after the health care debacle, Trump should move toward a grand bargain with Wall Street. In exchange for repealing regulations that gum up the works, Trump should demand that Wall Street change its compensation system to reward prudent risk-taking and accountability. A combination of smart regulation and smart incentives will insure that Wall Street can play its essential role while also penalizing bankers, traders and executives if they dare to blow things up again. William D. Cohan, a former Wall Street investment banker, is a special correspondent for Vanity Fair and the author most recently of “Why Wall Street Matters.” He wrote this for the Los Angeles Times.

Hafizah Osman (ARN) 10 April, 2017 13:28 - - - - print email Distributors Arrow ECS ANZ Australasian PC Distributors (APCD) Avnet Technology Solutions Bluechip Infotech BMS Technology Dicker Data Exclusive Networks Ingram Micro Australia Leader Computers Multimedia Technology NEXTGEN rhipe Synnex Wavelink Westcon – Comstor XiT Distribution Vendors Oracle Comments In the year just gone, Alexa and Siri became pseudo personal assistants that put AI into everybody’s pocket. Yet in 2017, despite Amazon and Apple advancing the market, the vendor landscape will remain heterogeneous and fragmented, with use cases still scarce. Rather, the next 12 months will see CIOs partner with marketing and CX colleagues to reap the benefits of AI, as it will increasingly be integrated into existing architectures and applications as a way to drive innovation throughout the year. “Previously, any talk of AI almost always meant robots performing human tasks,” ManageEngine vice-president, Sridhar Iyengar, recalled. “There was no talk about how such smart machines would be built.” In the 1990s, Iyengar said the AI conversation started to take the form of a “software brain” that could use data mining techniques to leverage data and discover meaningful patterns. “But conversations are now focused around deep learning and machine learning,” he observed. “Apart from discovering patterns, AI can make recommendations that businesses can use to strategise and win customers.” With AI set to become “commonplace in everyday life” by 2020 - Iyengar believes adoption will be driven by three key factors. Firstly, data is not scarce anymore, with the copious amounts of information available helping to build quantitative models that make use of algorithmic techniques such as machine learning, deep learning and predictive analytics. Secondly, computing power has become very affordable in the modern era, meaning that the once-expensive AI techniques are now in the reach of ordinary businesses. Thirdly, Iyengar believes businesses are primarily motivated by providing the best customer experience possible, with AI capable of reacting and responding in real-time to meet changing requirements. In short, data is the fuel for machine learning, with adoption driven by the ability to automate systems for recurring routine tasks, which translate to major productivity improvements. “The shift is enabled by improved processing power, better algorithms, and the availability of big data - structured and unstructured - which is fundamentally changing the way humans and machines work together,” SAP Innovation Centre Singapore vice-president, Christian Boos, said. In addition, Boos said most use cases of AI in business fall into two categories - automating transactional knowledge work in shared services environments, and developing cognitive platforms simplifying employees’ everyday lives and allowing them to focus on higher value tasks. “Businesses should want to deliver enterprise software systems that can learn how to fully automate business processes at unprecedented levels, react to real-time changes and provide the best possible results for today’s digital businesses,” Boos added. Customer demand pushes AI agenda Across Australia, CIOs will have a greater need for speed in 2017, with customer demand expected to push businesses to the limit in the coming year. Stemmed from increased end-user appetite, organisations are adopting new technology faster than ever before, buying new products or services quicker than previously, triggering the rise of AI, the Internet of Thing and augmented reality. Irrespective of technology however, success forever hinges on its ability to meet the changing demands of a customer, a customer that is becoming better informed, less patient and fickler by the day. With enterprise AI adoption still maturing, partners must now focus on providing relevant information at relevant times to build trust across the industry. “It’s more about building a trusting human/ machine partnership where users and machines work in tandem with each other to amplify business possibilities,” Oracle vice-president of product and data science for the Adaptive Intelligence Program, Jack Berkowitz, said. Depending on the business function, Berkowitz outlined the different applications capable of meeting different customer needs: - Finance professionals can negotiate best supplier terms, while optimising cash flow needs and balancing costs - Human resources recruiters can automatically identify best-fit candidates in the shortest time, while HR managers can create job descriptions to find well-suited positions - Marketing and commerce managers can drive higher conversion rates, lift, repeat purchases, and ultimately, revenue, with smart, contextual offers and recommended actions for individual consumers - Supply chain managers can automatically find the best options to distribute goods around the world, while optimising costs and price for both the buyers and the transporters. Channelling intelligence Despite an increased appetite to innovate, businesses remain challenged by a lack of knowledge within the field of artificial intelligence, creating opportunities for partners to capitalise on advisory and consultancy roles.

With rumors stating that a variation of the flagship tablet has already entered production, the release date of the iPad Pro 2 might be sooner than expected. The iPad Pro 2 has been a focus of the rumor mill for a while now. With the 12.9-inch iPad Pro and the 9.7-inch iPad Pro quickly getting outgunned by more advanced and updated rivals, it appears pertinent for Apple to ensure that it releases its most robust tablet to the market as soon as possible. In a lot of ways, Apple has already begun its attempt to recapture the tablet market, releasing the 2017 iPad, a low-cost alternative to its more robust Pro-series tablets, according to a TechRadar report. The 2017 iPad would most likely cater to everyday users who do not need cutting-edge specs for their devices. Thus, it would be up to the iPad Pro 2 to cater to power users who are in need of more firepower when it comes to their mobile productivity tasks. This is where the iPad Pro 2 comes in. #Apple #iPadPro2 #iPhone7 #ProductRED #iPhoneSE pic.twitter.com/dVXOEFopYR —  iDesigner (@AppleiDesigner) March 21, 2017 The iPad Pro 2 would be the latest entry into the tech giant’s most powerful tablet line, a line which Apple CEO Tim Cook has dubbed as an ideal laptop replacement. While the last two iPad Pros were immensely powerful devices, however, their capability for being a real laptop replacement was limited at best. With the iPad Pro 2, Apple would have the chance to ensure that this time around, its professional-grade tablet would indeed be robust enough to warrant a purchase from even the most power-conscious users. According to Business Insider‘s Dave Smith, Apple could make its iPad Pro 2 into a real laptop replacement by simply equipping the device with two extremely important features. Considering that Apple appears set on making the iPad Pro into its mobile productivity device, these particular features would indeed serve the Cupertino-based tech giant well. A very notable feature that is missing from the original 12.9-inch iPad and its 9.7-inch sibling is a desktop-grade file system. Apple’s MacOS has always garnered praise from users for its neat and organized filing algorithms. For Apple to create a real laptop replacement, the iPad Pro 2 would be served best by being equipped with a robust file system, capable enough to enable users’ data to be accessed and organized in such a way that is akin to a full-fledged laptop computer. We may be just a few weeks away from getting our first look at new Apple #iPadPro2. Check out full specifications https://t.co/k33sAnWfXW pic.twitter.com/btQwrDGNl9 — Seasia Infotech (@Seasiainfotech) March 17, 2017 Apart from a capable file system, Smith stated that Apple’s upcoming flagship tablet would boost its productivity capabilities if it gets released with full support for Apple’s Magic Trackpad and Magic Mouse. These two accessories, while currently utilized for the iMac, are immensely useful for real productivity tasks. Spreadsheets, for example, are incredibly tedious to create and edit with a touchscreen computer such as the iPad Pro. If the device could work with Apple’s proprietary mouse and trackpad, content creation on the iPad Pro 2 would definitely be a breeze. The iPad Pro 2 has not been officially announced by Apple, though speculations are high that the 10.5-inch variant of the device has already entered production. With this in mind, rumors are high that Apple might release the iPad Pro 2 within the first half of 2017. Otherwise, a release date together with the iPhone 8 is also possible. Pricing for the iPad Pro 2 has also not been confirmed by the Cupertino-based tech giant. Considering the price range of the two outgoing models, however, expectations are high that the iPad Pro 2 would be priced at around $799 for its entry-level variant.

LIKE   TWEET   SHARE   PIN   SHARE   POST MAIL MORE Posted 4 hours ago by iClarified · 994 views · Translate Apple is reportedly planning to add a Beats1 broadcasting booth to its flagship Fifth Ave store, according to a MacRumors source. The glass cube store is currently under renovations. When it reopens it will have over double the square footage. The person did not share any further details, but it's possible that New York City-based Beats 1 radio DJ Ebro Darden could broadcast at least some of his shows at the Fifth Avenue store once it reopens. Currently, he appears to broadcast from a studio in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan. The source describes the Beats1 booth as a "very unique area". Notably, the same person accurately revealed Apple's plans for its first retail store in Mexico prior to any official announcement. No word yet on when the Manhattan store will reopen but it's likely to feature Apple's next generation retail store design. Stay tuned to iClarified on Twitter, Facebook, Google+, or RSS for updates.

The iOS 10.3.1 update recently replaced Apple’s milestone iOS 10.3 upgrade and it now serves as the most up-to-date version of iOS 10 for the company’s mobile devices. iOS 10.3.1 is a tiny maintenance update if you’re coming to it from iOS 10.3. It’ll feature bug fixes and an important security patch. If you failed to download iOS 10.3 your iOS 10.3.1 update will be much bigger thanks to the features and fixes from iOS 10.3. Some people are still trying to decide if iOS 10.3.1 is worth it. Others, like you, have already installed the iOS 10.3.1 update. We recently provided some tips to potential iOS 10.3.1 users and today we want to switch gears and offer some tips to those of you that decided to download iOS 10.3.1 on your device. This guide walks you through some things you’ll want to do and some things you’ll want to avoid as you push away from the installation. Test Your Connectivity Maybe the first thing you’ll want to do after installing iOS 10.3.1 is to check all of connections to ensure they’re working properly. A few of these tests should only take you a few seconds. Test your Wi-Fi connectivity to make sure everything is working properly after the upgrade. You’ll also want to switch over to LTE/4G to make sure your cellular data is functioning. If you rely on GPS for your commute you’ll want to test it for accuracy. Beyond those, you’ll want to try pairing your device with your favorite Bluetooth devices. Maybe that’s a speaker, a headset or your car. If you own an Apple Watch, you’ll want to make sure your device is pairing properly. If you use your iPhone or iPad to control appliances in your house (lights, heat, front door, garbage, etc), you’ll also want to make sure those connections are synced up. Test Your Apps & Services We also recommend checking all of your apps and services to ensure they’re working normally after the iOS 10.3.1 update. This is especially important if you rely on said apps and services for your job or for school. There’s a chance a vital application or service will start acting up with iOS 10.3.1 on board. We’re already hearing and seeing complaints about iOS 10.3.1 problems and they include issues with Exchanges and various first and third-party apps. Check all of your key apps and services first then move onto your secondary ones. If you notice something out of the ordinary, you’ll want to take action. If you run into an issue with an application you’ll want to check the App Store to make sure you’re running the latest version of the app. iOS developers have been rolling out a steady stream of bug fix updates and an update could help stabilize the software. If your issue is related to work software, you’ll want to get into contact with your IT department if you have one. You might also check in with the developer (forum/customer service) to see if they have a remedy for you. This might sound tedious but checking these items is important. The last thing you want to do is walk into a presentation or a busy workday with broken software. Check All of Your Important Files You’ll also want to check and make sure all of your important files successfully made it over. This is particularly important if you came to iOS 10.3.1 from iOS 10.2.1 or something older. Everything should be fine but you should double-check to make sure your important photos, videos, and other data is in order. Over the years we’ve heard countless horror stories about files and data going missing so you’ll want to make sure everything is there. If something is missing, you’ll want to restore from a backup. That is if you made a backup before you installed iOS 10.3.1. Test New Features If you failed to download iOS 10.3 you’ll get its features baked into your iOS 10.3.1 update. iOS 10.3 was a large update. Some of iOS 10.3’s changes are small. Others might be game-changing for you. For instance, if you own a pair of AirPods you’ll want to get acquainted with the Find My AirPods function located inside the Find My iPhone app. It could save you time and maybe even a pair of AirPods. If you use CarPlay, you’ll want to get familiar with the changes to the UI and some of the smaller tweaks to the software. To help you get started you’ll want to take a look at our iOS 10.3.1 walkthrough. It’ll take you through the new features, the bug fixes and the important security patches on board. Don’t Panic iOS 10.3.1 users are reporting problems with the software and there’s a chance you’ll run into an issue with the update today, tomorrow, or a week from now. iOS issues can popup anytime. If you do run into a problem there’s no need to panic or freakout. You should be able to fix your issue from the comforts of your home or office. Before you throw your device against the wall, make an Apple Genius appointment or start railing on Apple on social media, try one of these fixes. We recently put together a list of fixes for the most common iOS 10 problems and it’s a great place to start if you’re noticing abnormal battery drain, issues with Wi-Fi, or problems with your Bluetooth connectivity. We’ve also put together a list of tips that should help you improve iOS 10.3.1 performance. If you can’t find what you’re looking for there, check out our list of resources for iOS 10.3.1 problems. Don’t Forget to Report Problems If you encounter an issue with iOS 10.3.1, make sure you report it to the proper entity. If you’re noticing issues with a first-party app or service, make sure you report the bug to Apple so that its engineers can look into it. You can do that via Apple’s Support account on Twitter and you can also get in touch with customer service via its website. You’ll also want to report it on the Apple Discussion Forums and here on the company’s feedback page. If you’re seeing issues with a third-party app or service, get in touch with the developer and, if necessary, leave a review on the App Store. Don’t Forget About the Downgrade And lastly, don’t forget that you can get off the iOS 10.3.1 update if your performance takes a hit. Apple is currently signing off on two older iOS updates (iOS 10.3 and iOS 10.2.1) which means you can drop to one of those if the going gets though. Just remember, this won’t be available forever. Apple could pull the plug on these updates today, tomorrow, or next week. Typically, the downgrade closes up a couple of weeks after an iOS release. Downgrading isn’t a guaranteed way to fix your issues but it’s an option. For more on the process, take a look at our walkthrough. 4 Reasons Not to Install iOS 10.3.1 & 7 Reasons You Should Install iOS 10.3.1 If You Want Better Security   1 / 11 If you value your security, you'll want to seriously consider downloading the iOS 10.3.1 update on your iPhone or iPad.  iOS 10.3.1 brings a single security patch for a potential Wi-Fi exploit. But if you failed to install iOS 10.3, your iOS 10.3.1 update will bring its monster list of patches as well.  The iOS 10.3 update delivered over 60 known patches for potential exploits. That's substantial, even for a milestone upgrade. The previous version of iOS 10, iOS 10.2.1, brought 14 known patches. Among them is a patch for a Safari ransomware bug that scammers used to extort iOS users who viewed pornography on their device.  These patches enhance the security on your iPhone, iPad and iPod touch making them ideal for those of you who store sensitive files/data on your device. Most people do. If you skipped the iOS 10.2.1 update and/or the iOS 10.2 update, know that iOS 10.3.1 brings their security patches with it as well. Again, the iOS 10.2.1 update had 14 important patches on board. You can see them all right here.  If you failed to install Apple's iOS 9.3.5 update, iOS 10.3.1 will also bring the three crucial security patches it delivered last year. These patch up serious security problems that could potentially expose your calls, contacts, texts, and emails. If security is important to you, iOS 10.3.1 is probably worth a download right now.   1 / 11 Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published. Comment Name* Email* Website

Our Top Laptops for College Picks Best for a Computer Science Degree Dell XPS 13 The Dell XPS 13 laptop might be on the pricier side, but with that you get ultrabook performance. Price: $942.39 | Read Full Review: Dell XPS 13 Review | Features: InfinityEdge display, touchscreen, Intel i5-6200U 2.3 GHz Processor WHY IT’S A TOP PICK: The Dell XPS 13 puts portability and power in a punchy, flexible package. A little on the pricier side – though cheaper than the Surface Book – Dell’s XPS13 is entirely worth it, and is truly one of the best laptops for college students in price and tech specs. With a 13.3-inch Full HD Infinity display, 4GB of RAM, 128GB SSD, the XPS 13 is the perfect mix of power and flexibility that college students need from their daily driver. The Dell XPS 13 will be able to keep up with even the most demanding tasks, whether that’s using tools like Photoshop and AutoDesk 3DS Max, or programming software like Android Studio and Eclipse. The Dell XPS 13 is also the perfect entertainment machine. With its 13.3-inch Infinity display, it has one of the sharpest images you’ll see on a portable machine. It’s perfect for the media professional, but also great for watching movies, TV shows, and even doubles as a halfway decent gaming laptop. View on Amazon – $942.39 Best Creative Arts College Laptop Apple Macbook The Macbook first got cool on college campuses, and it still hasn’t lost its edge Price: $1,269.00 | Features: Force Touch trackpad, Retina display, 10hr battery life WHY IT’S A TOP PICK: No other laptop has the same “cool” factor as a new Macbook. Although Apple and its ubiquitous Macbook line of laptops may not be the dominant force among college students these days, the company still knows how to make a solid machine that goes the distance when it comes to software integration and unique hardware tweaks. Apple still makes the Macbook Pro in both 13″ and 15″ flavors, but unless you know you’ll be doing a lot of heavy rendering or running intensive applications, the regular 12″ model should handle nearly any job you can throw at it with ease. The inclusion of the Force Touch mousepad is perfect for students who need to navigate through a lot of content quickly and easily, while OSX continues to be the operating system of choice among departments dedicated to the creative arts. If you have to run OSX for your particular program, or just want a dependable all-around laptop that’s perfect for any kind of project, the Macbook is still king with college students everywhere. View on Amazon – $1,269.00 Best Durable College Laptop HP Stream 13 The HP Stream 13 is a low-end laptop, intended for basic tasks like paper writing and spreadsheet construction. Price: $219.00 | Features: Durable shell, 32GB of SSD storage, one-year subscription to Office 365 WHY IT’S A TOP PICK: The HP Stream 13 wins on its raw ability to take a punch. If there’s one thing parents know about their kids, it’s how clumsy they can be when it comes to keeping their technology in one piece. The HP Stream is definitely the most durable (and colorful) laptop on this list, available in Cobalt Blue, Orchid Magenta, Violet Purple, and Horizon Blue. With a 13.3-inch display, an Intel Celeron N3050, 2GB of RAM, and 32GB of SSD storage, the Stream 13 is decidedly low-end, making it one of the cheapest laptops for college on our list. But what makes the HP Stream 13 one of the best laptops for college students? It’s ultra portability and the fact that it comes with a free year of Office 365, something that costs almost as much as the laptop itself. View on Amazon – $219.00 Best for Design/Photoshop Microsoft Surface Book The Microsoft Surface Book is our #1 laptop for college pick. Price: $1,399.99  | Features: Convertible design, touchscreen, 13.5″ display WHY IT’S A TOP PICK: If you’re in creative design, the Surface Book loves to get drawn on. With Microsoft’s Surface Book, you’re in for a treat. Fast, portable, and easy to set up.  The Surface Book also offers two different uses – laptop, and tablet (or “clipboard” mode). This adds to the portability, making it fantastic for the on-the-go student. With the base unit starting with a 13.5-inch display, an Intel Core i5 processor, 8GB of RAM, and 128GB of SSD storage, the Surface Book is perfect for the student that can handle the demands of Graphic Design and/or demanding software tools like CAD and Photoshop. And the ability to transform the Surface Book into a tablet is another great feature because it removes the need for another device.  It’s truly one of the best laptops for college students. View on Amazon – $1,399.99 Best Midrange College Laptop  ASUS X551MA The ASUS X551MA is the perfect blend between low-range and high-end laptops. Price: $315.00 | Features: 4GB RAM, 500GB storage, 15.6″ display WHY IT’S A TOP PICK: The X551 is a solid all-around laptop for any class you have on your schedule. ASUS’ X551MA makes our list of the best laptops for college students as its a perfect blend mid-range and is only $50 more than the HP Stream 13. Specs include a 15.6-inch display, an Intel dual-core Celeron N2830, 4GB of RAM, and 500GB of internal storage. It doesn’t have any special technology, but it’s a standard mid-range laptop that’ll handle basic tasks (and some demanding) with ease, whether that be writing papers or playing the occasional game. It’s one of the best affordable laptop for college students too, coming in at well under $300. View on Amazon – $315.00 Best Option for Students On the Go Samsung Chromebook 3 The Samsung Chromebook 2, next to the Acer Chromebook 15, is one of the most powerful Chromebooks on the market. Price: $179.00 | Features: 2.5lbs, Intel Celeron N3050 processor, 4GB of RAM WHY IT’S A TOP PICK: The ultra-portable Samsung Chromebook 3 fits inside any backpack. College students are known for lugging around backpacks packed to the zipper with textbooks that can sometimes weigh 50lbs or more, which is why sometimes portability is key when looking for your next laptop to take with you to university. Not only does the Samsung Chromebook 3 have an Intel Celeron N3050 processor, 4GB of RAM, 16GB of storage, and Intel HD Graphics, it does it all at a feather-light 2.5lbs. It also has Google’s suite of apps built-in, allowing you to put together papers, spreadsheets, and presentations online or offline if you’re out of range of the local dorm Wi-Fi connection. It comes with 100GB of free Google Drive storage, removing the need to keep any files on the machine itself. Prospective students should note, however, that with just an 11.6-inch 1366×768 display, the Samsung Chromebook 3 may not the perfect solution for streaming any sort of media content for too long without suffering from eye strain. View on Amazon – $399.99 Best Budget Pick  ASUS C201 The ASUS C201 is a compact and lightweight Chromebook, dedicated to all things Google. Price: $179.00 | Features: 13hr battery life, Rockchip CPU, Chrome OS WHY IT’S A TOP PICK: The ASUS C201 is a light, cheap Chromebook for all students out there. This Chromebook is quite the popular buy, and we can see why: it’s a one of the best cheap laptops for students. It weighs a meager 2lbs, sports up to 13-hours of battery life, and has a Rockchip 3288-C quad-core processor, making the ASUS C201 Chromebook one of the most reliable machines you can get your hands on. The aspect that sets this Chromebook apart from everything else is it’s ability to last up to 13-hours on battery. View on Amazon – $179.00 Best Chromebook for College  Acer Chromebook 15 The Acer Chromebook 15 is one of Acer’s most powerful Chromebooks yet. Price: $499.99 | Read Full Review: Acer Chromebook 15 Review | Features: Intel Core i5-5200u CPU, 15.6″ FHD LED screen WHY IT’S A TOP PICK: The Acer Chromebook 15 is perfect for work or play on campus. Acer’s Chromebook 15 is lightweight for perfect portability, has a 2.16GHz processor, and falls just under $500. Add that to the sleek, modern design and you have a solid all-around machine for any member of the family. Although the Toshiba Chromebook 2 beat the Acer 15 in screen quality, the Acer is still great for college students because it packs in just a few more of the features that kids want like big speakers to share media with their friends, and a slightly roomier display if they need to multitask on multiple projects at once. Whether you need to write a paper or collaborate in Google Drive, the Chromebook 15 will perform without a problem. And, just like any Chromebook, it comes with a free 100GB of Google Drive storage to give you plenty of room to store documents and other files while on the go. View on Amazon – $499.99 How We Chose the Best Laptops for College When looking for the best laptops for college students, we pulled from a wide range of options both in price and features to give you the broadest spectrum of options available. Just like every college student is different, so is the laptop choice that’s right for them. Some don’t need a lot of power and prefer portability over everything else, while others might require a machine that can render 3D models and watch lectures streaming online at the same time. Because laptops go everywhere with their corresponding college student, every choice we’ve made here is durable enough to stand up to punishment for all four years they’re earning their degree, but also light enough to slide into a backpack quickly and easily without any hassle. A laptop for college needs to boot quickly, run smoothly, and be able to run almost any program you can think of (in case next semester you decide you want to pursue VFX design instead of biochemistry). Ultimately the laptop that’s right for you or your kids will combine all the best aspects of a laptop into one complete package at a cost that’s manageable for your expectations. Key Factors to a Top Laptop For College Performance: There’s no need to overbuy in power. Find the right power for your needs. For instance, if you’re just picking up a laptop for writing papers, you might not need something with a large capacity SSD, a hefty processor, and 8GB of RAM..and with it a hefty price tag. Likewise, if you’re buying something for a Graphic Design or CAD class, you’ll likely need something much heftier than just 4GB of RAM and a dual-core processor. Find a laptop that meets your needs and sets you up for success. Portability: Make sure to purchase a thin and lightweight laptop. There’s nothing worse than carrying around a chunky laptop that’s awkward and heavy to lug around campus or to the library. It’s also good practice to make sure your laptop has a small footprint, allowing you to easily put it in most backpacks or carrying bags alongside textbooks and other study materials. Battery: Find a laptop with a good battery, preferably one that’ll last you all day and then some. For instance, the ASUS C201 has a battery that lasts up to 13-hours, giving you plenty of study time during the day and then some. While you might not need that much, it’s good to search for laptops that will last a little over three hours. Who Should Buy a Laptop for College Of course, you don’t have to be straight out of high school to be in the market for a new college laptop. Whether you’re unpacking your bags in a dorm away from home for the first time or returning after a long hiatus to finish up your master’s degree, buying a fresh laptop before classes start in the fall is always a solid investment. What classes you plan on taking, as well as the degree you’re pursuing should have an impact on the laptop you eventually choose to go with. If you need something sleek and powerful that can turn on instantly for rapid-fire notetaking, the Dell XPS 13 or Zenbook UX360AC should suit the job just fine. But, if you’re worried about spending a ton of cash on a laptop that not might last more than a few months without getting beer spilled in the keyboard, the HP Stream 13 and Acer C201 are cheaper, durable options that can weather any alcohol-related storm. Mistakes to Avoid When Buying a College Laptop Don’t make the mistake of buying the wrong operating system. Some school programs will specifically require either a Windows or OSX-based laptop (be sure to check your syllabus) for programs like Photoshop and Gimp. If your learning is strictly reading books, writing papers, and taking quizzes, then you might not need the aforementioned operating systems. In that case opt for a Chromebook, especially if all your activities will be Web based. Another thing to avoid is having too little RAM or hard drive space. The a solid laptop for students will have just enough storage capacity and RAM for studying, completing assignments, and play. If your degree program requires a lot of heavy duty software, find a laptop that has 4GB of RAM or more and a hard drive with 500GB of storage space or more. This will be enough to ensure that any software you throw on your computer runs smoothly without any hiccups.  And keep in mind that an SSD hard drive will increase speeds as well, especially start up time. And never buy at full retails.  As a student always be on the look for those student discounts, even if something already seems cheap! Most Important Features Hard Drive As far as Windows laptops go, and you don’t use many programs, look for a hard drive with a capacity of 256GB or higher. It’ll meet your needs and then some. If you’re a power user, look for 500GB or higher so there’s more than enough space for other content. If most of your activity takes place on the Web, then you might not need a hard drive larger than 32GB, which is just enough space for the operating system and storing a handful of documents offline. If possible, find a solid-state drive over a traditional hard drive. Performance and speeds will increase astronomically. RAM If you need to do anything more demanding than just using a web browser, find a laptop that has at least 4GB of RAM or more, ideally 8GB, especially if you plan on using programs like Photoshop. If you’re just using a web browser, look for a laptop with a minimum of 2GB of RAM. Your computer, whether it be Windows or Chrome OS, won’t even use that much, but it still ensures the speed and responsiveness of your machine. Alternatively, find a machine that you can upgrade the RAM yourself, which can save you money during the initial investment. Operating System It’s important to find the right operating system for your College program. If you’re in Computer Science or something that requires you to use Windows or Mac applications, it’s good to shy away from Chromebooks. If your studying takes place online and doesn’t require you to use any Windows or Mac applications, jump the gun and get a Chromebook. Processor A lower clocked dual-core processor below 2GHz won’t slow down your laptop if you’re using it for minor tasks like writing papers, browsing the web, watching media, and so on. If you’re in a degree program that has some demanding programs (e.g. Photoshop, Autodesk 3DS Max, and medical software), make sure you look for a quad-core processor with a clock speed of 2GHz or higher. Not only will it last you longer running these types of programs, but rendering and general speed will be a lot faster and more efficient than a dual-core CPU below 2GHz. At the same time, don’t overbuy in processor clock speed. For instance, there aren’t many differences between a quad-core 3.7GHz processor and a quad-core 3.9GHz processor. The only real difference is the much higher price tag. There’s little effect as far as processing power and efficiency goes. Display Finding a good display has much to do with the size that you’re comfortable with and need to work with. Whether it be 11-inch or 17-inch displays, they’re all good as long as they have a resolution of 720p or higher. Anything below that is often blurry and has very little clarity. You’ll want to make sure your display has a refresh rate of at least 60Hz to avoid any screen tearing or altered graphics when playing games and watching movies. The display you purchase should have built-in features for reducing eye strain, such as dimming the brightness or even having a feature for night use. This will help a lot as far as eye strain goes. Battery Some lectures can last over four hours in a single sitting, which is why you’ll want a laptop that can at least double up on two of those a day without needing a recharge. Most good quality laptops will have built-in power saving features that can stretch their life to 10 hours or more. You should be able to get a full charge in just two to three hours, allowing you to quickly get back to work whenever needed. Ports The best laptops for college students will have more than a single USB port. More manufacturers are headed towards just including one USB port, but it’s truly a hassle to deal with, as you can’t really plug in any extra peripherals or accessories without connecting a USB hub first. Make sure the laptop you buy has an HDMI, DVI, VGA, or Display Port. You never know when you might need to switch to a bigger screen, and having one of these ports will let you do that, with VGA being the most common for projectors you’d find in the average classroom. Which Best Laptops for College Students are right for you? Need something powerful that can handle the demands from Photoshop and/or CAD? Then the Microsoft Surface Book and Dell XPS 13 are laptops that are right up your alley. Alternatively, if you’re looking for something more humble for doing your everyday tasks at college and maybe a little media consumption when you have some time off, then the ASUS X551MA or HP Stream 13 are both laptops to consider. And, then there are Chromebooks, web-based laptops. Some are hesitant to jump on the Chromebook bandwagon, and might not consider them the best laptops for college students, simply because you can’t use Windows-based software on it. You might be surprised, but more often than not, we just don’t use the programs on Windows, strictly using web browsers like Chrome and Firefox for all of our computer use. Still not sure if these are the best laptops for college students? Then take a look at our laptops for college reviews, as they might just be able to help you make that final decision.

When Ralph Goodale and David McGuinty headed to the UK and France last January to get ideas about overseeing national security issues in Canada, it seemed like an intelligent thing to do. But did our public safety minister and his MP colleague go to the wrong place? The Liberals, after all, are trying to amend Bill C-51, a controversial piece of anti-terrorism legislation that Canadians don’t like. No wonder. What’s to like about a government—sanctioned police state law? Under Harper-era legislation, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) was empowered to operate outside the Charter of Rights, which gave it authority to violate citizens’ constitutional rights. And Canada’s cyber intelligence agency, the Communications Security Establishment (CSE) was allowed to conduct mass collection of information on Canadians without a specific target. Based on their attitudes towards mass surveillance, Britain and France are hardly the countries to help Canada rein in the excesses of Bill C-51. According to a YouGov survey of 15,000 people reported this week by Amnesty International, citizens of Britain, France and the Philippines were most comfortable with government eavesdropping. Britain was one of three countries out of 13 surveyed where more people favoured surveillance of all people — British citizens, foreigners, and foreign countries, than favoured monitoring none of them. A British MP, David Davis, was quoted in the Guardian with something of an explanation: “Because for the past 200 years we haven’t had a Stasi or a Gestapo, we are intellectually lazy about it.” And there is another big reason to be skeptical that Britain in particular has much to offer by way of helping this country to rein in its spooks. This week the Cameron government published its draft version of the Investigatory Powers Bill. It is Britain’s answer to the Apple-versus-the-FBI battle in the United States, where a controversy is raging over privacy issues and the government’s authority to breach the confidentiality of information contained on devices like iPhones. The Cameron government’s answer is both draconian and Orwellian, which may explain why 200 senior lawyers have written that the legislation breaches international law and is “unfit” for the its purpose. Why? It utterly destroys any known concept of privacy, and worse, it moves the power to breach that privacy from the judiciary to the government. It is, in plain language, the Big Brother Charter. Like it or not, CSIS, CSE, and the RCMP have already profoundly failed Canadians on the privacy issue. Everyone knows how tragically the intelligence community failed Mahar Arar. All governments obfuscate when they snatch unseemly power, and the Cameron regime is no exception. Britain’s home secretary, Theresa May, says the Investigatory Powers Bill is absolutely necessary to ensure national security and to allow the nation’s police and intelligence services to track and identify terrorists, pedophiles and other serious criminals. If that sounds like an echo of former public safety minister Vic Toews, that’s because it is. We were either with Vic the Eavesdropper or the child molesters, remember? Utter rot then, and rot now. Here’s the price in the UK of folding on the privacy issue. The government would require that internet service providers retain data on their customers, such as browsing records, for twelve months in the event that intelligence agencies decide they need it. According to Google, Facebook, Microsoft and Apple, all of whom oppose the legislation, such legislation would also usher in an era of bulk surveillance, less effective encryption, and circumstances in which the companies would have to hack their own customers. Britain’s equivalent of the CSE, the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), argues that it requires bulk interception of information, whether that be emails or digital records, in pursuit of the bad guys. Paradoxically, GCHQ simultaneously argues that collecting metadata from its own citizens is neither mass surveillance nor breach of privacy. It is, of course, both. The Cameron government intends to pass the highly contentious legislation, which is opposed by hundreds of senior lawyers, judges, law professors, forty law schools and Silicon Valley, by the end of 2016. That is when the existing Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Act 2014 is set to expire. If it does pass, Britain will become the first liberal democratic state to place the powers to hack on a statutory footing. And as terrorism expert David Anderson QC put it, it would make the UK the only member of the Five Eyes security and intelligence alliance, which includes Canada, to vest the power to approve bulk surveillance in government rather than the judiciary. It is not known if the government’s final bill will include amendments. Minister Goodale and MP McGuinty should note where Canada fit in the super-snoop debate as reflected in the YouGov survey. Like most countries, Canadians are not wild about mass government surveillance — at least when they are the ones being monitored. Only 23 percent thought Ottawa should monitor all Canadian citizens. But it is a different matter when “others” are being watched. When it comes to monitoring foreign nationals, 48 percent of Canadians polled approved. But here’s the catch. Like it or not, CSIS, CSE, and the RCMP have already profoundly failed Canadians on the privacy issue. Everyone knows how tragically the intelligence community failed Mahar Arar. Most Canadians also remember how CSE failed to protect Canadians’ metadata, which it had no mandate to collect legally, before sharing it with allies. CSE Commissioner Jean-Pierre Plouffe confirmed that in his belated annual report to Parliament. Nor should it be forgotten that during the Harper era both CSIS and the RCMP have been accused of breaking the law by spying on environmental groups, particularly those critical of Alberta’s tarsands development and proposed pipelines. It was Matt Millar, then a reporter with the Vancouver Observer, who obtained documents under Freedom of Information showing that the National Energy Board coordinated with the RCMP and CSIS to monitor groups like Idle No More, ForestEthics, Sierra Club, Leadnow, the Dogwood Initiative and the Council of Canadians. Nor did it build public confidence when Millar later reported that the head of the Security Intelligence Review Committee, Chuck Strahl, was a lobbyist for Enbridge Inc., the company behind the Northern Gateway Pipeline project. Much that the Liberals have proposed by way of amending C-51 is admirable. It is admirable that the Prime Minister has said that all warrants sought by CSIS will have to respect the Charter of Rights. It is a good step to ensure that no Canadian is punished for lawful protest or advocacy. And, depending on the fine print, it is reassuring that a National Security Oversight Committee will be established with members from all parties. Less reassuring is the government’s silence on assistance orders that could permit a judge to order an organization or individual to assist CSIS. And it is downright unsettling that the PM is also silent on the issue of how C-51 allows information relating to security to be shared among a dozen federal departments — a clause that the Canadian Bar Association says could be used to stifle social activism. Canadians need more than cosmetic “safeguards” tacked on to anti-terror legislation as an afterthought or a sop to critics. They need adherence to the fundamental right to privacy so grossly violated by the Harper version of C-51 voted for by Justin Trudeau. There are no two ways about it: authorizing bulk interception of information by CSE or any other organization is merely legitimizing mass surveillance. You don’t have to go to the UK to find out that Canadians are not up for that. Michael Harris is a writer, journalist, and documentary filmmaker.

He and his family had reluctantly begun packing up toys, books and kitchen appliances for an imminent move to Texas. Steve Duke was laid off from Les Schwab Tires when the company relocated its headquarters to Bend. He was unemployed for a year before landing a job at Facebook. Amanda Peacher/OPB   Duke lost his job when his employer, Les Schwab Tires, moved its headquarters from Prineville to Bend. He spent the next year looking for work. “It was horrible,” Duke said. “There were no jobs in Central Oregon at that time.” But just before he was about to uproot his life and move across the country, a friend encouraged Duke to apply for a job at Facebook. He was hired soon after. Now Duke schedules all of the electrical and mechanical maintenance for Facebook facilities in Prineville. “Having [an] opportunity to stay here meant everything,” Duke said. “I fully plan to retire in Central Oregon.” His community is one of many Northwest timber towns that struggled to reinvent themselves after the timber booms of the 1970s and ‘80s. Prineville was once home to at least five lumber mills, as well as the headquarters of Les Schwab. RELATED COVERAGE Central Oregon Is Among Nation's Fastest Growing Regions   A few years ago, the community welcomed an unexpected new industry: data centers. Now, the economy in Crook County is as much about the tech industry as natural resources. The arrival of Facebook and Apple in Prineville created about 300 new permanent jobs. But the new tech economy in this old Western town has also put the squeeze on other resources. The region faces one of the most severe housing shortages in the state. Escalating rents make it hard for low-income residents to find or keep housing. And now an unexpected electricity shortfall in Crook County could hurt efforts to attract even more new industry. Timber, Tires, And Now Technology The recession hit Prineville especially hard. Unemployment rose to about 20 percent, the highest in the state, and residents started slipping away to other communities. Mayor Betty Roppe said that before 2008, the city’s population topped 10,000, but that dropped dramatically during the recession. “We decided we needed to be diverse,” Roppe said. “What Prineville was is Les Schwab Tires, a lot of mills, a lot of blue-collar workers.” Back then, when Roppe and other community leaders were exploring economic options, data centers were not on their radar. “But once we did some research we did find we saw the potential benefits,” she said. “We want to keep it a healthy place for them to operate.” RELATED COVERAGE Apple Plans 3rd Data Center In Prineville   Facebook broke ground on its first Prineville data center in 2010, followed by Apple in 2012. Once both companies finish new construction that’s currently underway Prineville will have a total of six data centers. Apple is less open about its operations and personnel than Facebook, which regularly gives tours of its facilities to elected officials and media. Data centers sometimes have a reputation for using a lot of water and electricity, but Facebook’s site manager Todd Flack likes to show people the extensive energy efficiency measures the company has in place. Facebook says the facility is one of the most energy efficient data centers in the world. Still, the building uses as much energy as all of the other homes and businesses in Crook County combined. Sage Van Wing/OPB   Facebook’s 150 jobs in Prineville are far from equaling one of the old lumber mills, but the positions it does offer are diverse, Flack said.   “Everything from server repair to electricians to heating and cooling specialists, landscape specialists, culinary specialists, security specialists,” he said. The company tries to hire locally when possible, and through an agreement with the city, its average wages are 150 percent of the usual pay in Crook County. “And of course they’ve built a lot of buildings in our community,” Roppe said. “That brings jobs through the construction of those buildings. Usually, they have about 400 people working on each one. It’s been a good business to bring to our community.” Construction Boom Equals A Housing Crunch All those construction jobs mean that Prineville’s restaurants are booming.   “When you go out to eat on a Tuesday night, I’ve actually shown up and had to wait,” said Crook County Judge Seth Crawford. “If you look at other rural communities across the state, they sure don’t have that problem.”     RELATED COVERAGE Prineville Moves Forward With Plans To Convert Old School Into Affordable Housing   The lines at the grocery stores and the 10-car traffic jams sometimes seen downtown are part of that boom. But so is a dramatic housing shortage. “I’m not opposed to them being here, but it’s hard on the local people who don’t make that much money,” said Mary Sanislo, who works in one of Prineville’s last lumber mills.   From 2011 to 2016, rents rose more than 45 percent in Prineville — that’s the second highest rate of increase of any city in the nation, according to a LendingTree study. Home prices have also been on the rise. That’s good news if you’re a homeowner in Prineville. But it’s tough for renters like Sanislo’s daughter, a single mom who she says was recently given 30 days to move out when her landlord decided to sell. “Try to find something in a month,” Sanislo said. “There’s no way. She’s having to move in with a friend in Redmond so that she’s got a place to live. With all four of her kids.” Vacancy rates are near zero, so finding a new rental can be an impossible challenge in Prineville. City and county leaders are well aware of the housing and crunch and are working with nonprofit and other groups on some emergency housing solutions, such as fast tracking approval of new RIV sites. Gridlock On The Electricity Grid Although Roppe would love to see more data centers come to Prineville, the city is also working to bring new manufacturing and other jobs to the area. But a recently-realized electricity crunch could make recruiting new companies a challenge. An electricity-intensive manufacturing company was recently exploring opening up a facility in Crook County. Roppe didn’t know the identity of the company, but representatives promised that it could bring more than 300 jobs. It turned out that the company needed more energy than the area could support. RELATED COVERAGE Crook County Rejects Controversial Natural Resources Plan   “It put us in a little bit of an embarassing spot,” Roppe said. “We thought we had it.” City officials assumed that the electricity the Bonneville Power Administration had indicated was available back in 2012 would still be at the ready for new development. But in the years since, BPA made changes to the grid system, and the area can no longer support that additional power demand. The utility retired certain transmission equipment, and plans for certain upgrades to the grid were modified, unexpectedly limiting Prineville’s energy capacity. That’s another side effect of the data centers, which are the largest electricity consumers in the county despite all of their energy efficiency measures. In 2015, the Facebook data centers consumed 284 megawatts, about enough electricity to power 26,000 homes.   The shortage may mean that the owners of the manufacturing facility decide to build elsewhere, although Roppe said Prineville is still on the company’s list. Facebook site manager Todd Flack says that Prineville and Crook County have been good partners for the company. "I'm proud of the work that they've been doing to reimagine their economy," he said. Amanda Peacher/OPB   More generally, the complications with the electricity grid were a wake-up call for this little city that’s working hard to grow and diversify. Roppe said it’s something the city will be in better communication with BPA from now on. “We’re keeping much closer watch on it now than we did before,” she said. “We’re okay, but we’re definitely being proactive about making sure we have enough for what we need in the future.” Facebook Apple Prineville Crook County Bonneville Power Administration housing unemployment More News New Earthquake Alert System Rolls Out In Oregon, Washington Family Killed In Oregon Plane Crash Remembered For Fun-loving Spirit Lillard Time: Blazers' Star Hitting A Groove In Playoff Push What's Life Like In A Town Up For Sale?

According to a khaleejtimes.com report, citing Arabic daily Emarat Al Youm, the UAE’s Ministry of Economy stated that only specific iPhone 6s which contain defective batteries made in China during September and October 2015 will be recalled. Apple has recently expressed that a very small number of iPhone 6s devices may unexpectedly shut down. If you have experienced this issue, the firm has urged residents to use the serial number checker (www.apple.com/ae/support/iPhone6s-unexpectedshutdown/) if your iPhone 6s is eligible for a battery replacement, free of charge.

Whether Apple or Android, we cannot live without our phones, which is hardly surprising when they are used for everything from calls to photography to connecting on Facebook. One company now thinks they have the answer. Insurance firm MORE TH>N has released a "prosthetic phone" to help users wean themselves off their devices and have a good old digital detox. It has the same weight and dimensions as a typical smartphone, the only difference being that it comes without any of the technical capabilities, writes our sister paper The Mirror. That means no calling or texting, no camera and no internet – in reality, it's just a block of black plastic. The concept has been developed by direct financial services firm MORE TH>N as part of its Give Your Mobile The Boot campaign. In reality it is just a lump of plastic (MORE TH>N) Brits spend almost nine hours a day hooked to their digital devices, with 29 per cent unable to go more than an hour without checking their phone and 23 per cent recognising they are addicted to their gadgets. The initiative is encouraging drivers to put their mobiles in the boot of the car before they begin their journey, so they are not tempted to use them on the road. MORE TH>N claims that the prosthetic phone helps alleviate the feelings of anxiety or insecurity that people can often experience when physically separated from their smartphone. While it may sound silly, the psychological and physiological effects smartphone addiction have been recognised in several recent university studies. READ MORE: Don't say 108 to Siri on your iPhone, it could bring you nothing but trouble MORE TH>N's own research revealed that one in 20 Brits describe their phone as being "like an extra limb", while one in eight claim to have "phone separation anxiety". More than a third (35 per cent) also admit to experiencing "phantom vibration syndrome", where they imagine getting a notification, text or call but haven't actually received one . "The physical dependency and sense of attachment that many people have with their smartphone means our relationship with it is now far more complex than using it simply as a method of communication," said psychologist and writer Amanda Hills, who is working with MORE TH>N on the campaign. "With this in mind, it will certainly be interesting to see how effective the artificial phone trial is in providing people with a physical implement to potentially help condition themselves to become less reliant on their real mobile device." It's time to beat your phone addiction (MORE TH>N) MORE TH>N is currently looking for volunteers to trial the artificial phones and to feed back on how effective they are at easing phone separation anxiety. People wishing to register their interest in taking part in a one-week "clinical trial" of the artificial phone prototype, in return for a £20 Amazon voucher, can do so by visiting the MORE THN Facebook page for more information. "While we have initially created a limited run of prototypes for self-confessed PSA sufferers to trial and feed back on, if they prove to be a hit, we are certainly eager to make them widely available so more people can feel confident that they don't need their phone behind the wheel," said Kenny Leitch, global connected insurance director at MORE TH>N. You can also join the wider Give Your Mobile The Boot campaign by making the following pledge on social media: "I'm pledging to put my mobile phone in the boot before my next drive #BootYourMobile." *Read more of today's top news stories here.

Tech Apple Science Cars Samsung Nintendo Switch iPhone 7S & 8 Nintendo NES     Here Is Why Apple IPhone 8 May Be Delayed Posted: Apr 9 2017, 11:09am CDT | by Ahmed Humayun, in Rumors | Apple     iPhone 8 may be delayed due to technical issues in 3D sensor  iPhone 8 has been the only center of attention in Apple’s line-up of upcoming products this year. Now, whether there will be two other iPhone models or not, doesn’t matter, iPhone 8 is what everyone will be saving for. Unfortunately, according to a recent rumor, Apple has run into some serious bugs with the 3D sensing technology which is supposed to be featured and debuting in iPhone 8 this year. Don't Miss: The hottest Apple Rumors for 2017 Due to these issues, this year’s range-topper in the line-up of iPhone models may not be launched before November this year. Apple recently developed the 3D sensing technology, an AR feature which works by capturing images from all the cameras onboard along with an infrared sensor. The data collected here will be compatible for 3D selfies and inside AR games. 3D sensing technology is only going to be featured in iPhone 8, so, if there are iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus in Apple’s upcoming products, they will be launched following the usual September timeframe. Reports from reliable resources stated that Apple has ordered 70 million OLED panels for iPhone from Samsung. And the current report states that OLED panels will only be featured in iPhone 8, while iPhone 7s and 7s Plus will pack an LCD. Seems like Apple has projected a high sale for iPhone 8. What’s new other than the fore mentioned report is the return of another rumor, stating that iPhone 8 will be packing a smart connector. Smart connector has opened a tons of new possibilities which may take iPhone towards the modular smartphone field, where iPhone will be able to attach a top-notch camera, AR and VR equipment and whatnot.

Show Caption Hide Caption Previous Next BLUE SPRINGS, Mo. - UPDATE: Jason Dela-Cruz has been taken into custody in Columbus, Ohio. Police say he turned himself in. PREVIOUS: Police say 12-year-old Apple Briscoe has been found safe. Briscoe's family says the girl was found at a diner.  Suspect William Dela-Cruz has been taken into custody by Wentzville, Mo. police. Police are still searching for Jason Dela-Cruz and his silver Nissan Versa. Police say Apple Briscoe may be traveling with William L. Dela-Cruz (top) and Jason A. Dela Cruz (bottom). Apple Briscoe's mother, Ashley Briscoe, told 41 Action that her daughter met William Dela-Cruz while playing Onigiri, an online video game. Ashley Briscoe said she took all of her daughter's technology away after she noticed calls from a strange number but said Apple ran away while she was at a concert Saturday night. "She's usually really responsible. My son told me that she had gotten in a car with some man and she was gone," said Ashley Briscoe. 41 Action News was at the Briscoe home when FBI agents told the family the good news that Apple was found safe.   "Thanks to whoever looked out for her, from mother to mother, parent to parent. You have no idea how you've saved my family and my daughter's life," Ashley Briscoe said.   She has a message for the two suspects who took her daughter.   "You're not human, you know. You don't do that to human beings, you don't use them as objects. You don't do that to families," Ashley Briscoe said. ORIGINAL STORY: An Amber Alert has been issued for a missing 12-year-old girl from Blue Springs. Apple S. Briscoe was reported missing from the 2500 block of northwest 6th Street in Blue Springs on Sunday morning.  She's described as white, 5 feet 3 inches tall and weighing 125 pounds. She has brown hair and green eyes. She's believed to be traveling with 22-year-old William L. Dela-Cruz. Dela-Cruz is described as an Asian male, 5 feet 10 inches tall and weighing 220 pounds. He has brown hair and brown eyes. She also may be with 24-year-old Jason A. Dela-Cruz. Jason Dela-Cruz is described as an Asian male with brown hair and brown eyes. Police believe Apple may be traveling with Dela-Cruz and may possibly be heading to an unknown destination in Maryland.  Police believe Apple Briscoe was talking to William Dela-Cruz online and that William and his brother, Jason, drove to Blue Springs to pick her up on Saturday night. The suspects' vehicle is a silver 2015 Nissan Versa. It has Maryland license plates that read "6CK5071." If you have any information on Apple or the suspects' whereabouts, you are encouraged to call the Blue Springs Police Department at 816-228-0152 or the Crimestoppers hotline at 816-474-TIPS (8477). Police say William and Jason Dela-Cruz may be driving a silver 2015 Nissan Versa with Maryland license plates. --------   Follow 41 Action News on Twitter: Follow @41ActionNews Like 41 Action News on Facebook: Copyright 2017 Scripps Media, Inc.

Apple has long been rumored to be jumping on the autonomous car bandwagon, and while plans to develop its own self-driving car known as “Project Titan” were halted last year, Automotive News reports that new evidence has emerged implying that the company is still developing autonomous car technology. Documents released by Apple in February showed a list of suppliers it’s working with, including Robert Bosch. Specifically, Apple lists Bosch’s office in Reutlingen, Germany, where the firm’s automotive electronics division is based. While Apple predictably refused to comment, a spokesperson from Bosch confirmed that the company is working with Apple as a supplier, but didn’t go into specifics. At this stage, it’s difficult to speculate the extent of Apple and Bosch’s partnership, but the documents suggest that it could be automotive-related, particularly as Bosch’s Reutlingen office develops components for vehicle sensors and electronic control units, which power braking, steering and other vehicle systems. Apple’s potential partnership with Bosch to develop self-driving technology follows its recent public comment last year on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s autonomous vehicle guidelines. “The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation,” it said at the time. The comment reignited speculation about Apple’s self-driving project after it reportedly laid off dozens of engineers working on the project last year. A collaboration with Bosch would make sense, as Apple has previously suggested it wants to develop sensors and software for autonomous driving rather than build its own self-driving car. Apple also already made a mark in the auto industry thanks to its CarPlay system which regularly features in infotainment systems.

Credit: Babor Balogh iPhone 8 concept. Credit: Babor BaloghMore If these drawings are to be believed, supposedly made by a Foxconn worker, many of the iPhone 8 rumors we've seen are going to come true. Spotted by BGR and leaked on the Chinese site Weibo, the first drawing shows a front that's almost all screen, so you can possibly expect a Touch ID sensor integrated into the display. There's also dual camera up front, which lines up with reports that Apple is working on a 3D camera system for the iPhone 8. This would likely be used to log you into the device via face recognition. Credit: WeiboMore Credit: Weibo The illustration of the back of the iPhone 8 shows dual cameras as well, similar to the iPhone 7 Plus, but it's positioned vertically instead of horizontally. The Weibo report mentions that this could also be a 3D camera, which could open up all sorts of augmented reality applications. Last but not least, the Foxconn worker drew where the antenna lines would be at the bottom of the phone, which seem pretty subtle. Other rumored features for the iPhone 8 include a curved OLED display, as well as wireless charging and a powerful new A11 chip. The device will likely be announced in September, but based on recent reports actual shipments could be delayed until later in the fall.

DailyTimes | Argentina’s lesson for Trump: tariffs made poverty worse Toggle navigation    Home Pakistan World Business Sport Life & Style Opinion Blogs Features Today's Paper E-PAPER Archives Argentina’s lesson for Trump: tariffs made poverty worse By:   agencies 09-Apr-17 364 Top News Match-fixing mars Spain’s lower football divisions 10-Apr-17 192 MADRID: The shocking testimony ... Pavlyuchenkova topples Kerber to lift fourth Monterrey crown 10-Apr-17 228 MONTERREY: Russia’s Anas ... Make it in the United States or face a big border tax. That’s President Trump’s warning to companies if they move jobs to Mexico. It also echoes a policy Argentina tried before that didn’t work out so well. In 2011, Argentina’s then president Christina Fernandez de Kirchner imposed a 35% tariff on imported cell phones, computers and tablets. It was meant to protect manufacturing workers. Some companies like Blackberry did move jobs to Argentina; others such as Apple passed. As a result, Argentina became one of the most expensive places in the world to buy iPhones and iPads. Phone stores stopped selling them — they could only be bought from online vendors or the unofficial, black market. To dodge the tariffs and sky high prices, many Argentines traveled to nearby Chile, or even as far as the United States, to buy Apple products. Six years later, Argentina is killing off the policy. President Mauricio Macri’s government eliminated the 35% tariff on computers and tablets on Sunday. Many expect tariffs on imported cell phones will also soon be torn up by the business-friendly government. “Protectionism, isolationism, the last 30 years — the only [achievement] was consolidating poverty,” Macri told CNN in an interview Thursday in Buenos Aires. On Friday, phone stores in Argentina will legally sell iPhones for the first time since 2011. Argentina’s experience serves as a cautionary tale. The country chose between the desires of millions of consumers and protecting a group of workers that needed tariffs to keep their jobs. Someone had to lose. The country is just emerging from a recession, partly caused by trade policies that caused prices to skyrocket. “Protectionism leads to nowhere,” says Daniel Artana, chief economist at the Latin American Economic Research Institute. “It’s part of the reason why we’re not a success story.” An iPhone 7 Plus goes for just under $1,400 these days, according to Mercado Libre, the eBay of Argentina. The same iPhone in the US sells for $869. The difference reflects many factors but tariffs account for a big chunk. It’s the same story for iPads. An iPad Pro in Argentina sells for nearly $1,300. The same iPad Pro in America: $699. (The iPad tariff is gone, but it’s going to take a little time for prices to come down.) The US and Argentina are very different economies and tariffs are unlikely to play out in exactly the same way. Argentina is one of the most closed economies in the world to trade; America is one of the most open. But experts say the bottom line is the same everywhere: Prices go up and consumers get hurt. Employers in Argentina say it’s time for a change. Removing tariffs “is very positive. We need to be open to the world,” says Guillermo Brinkmann, managing director at SAP for Latin America and the Caribbean. Argentina’s move to free up trade comes as Trump meets with China’s President Xi Jinping in Florida. Trump wants to reduce the US trade deficit with China and has threatened tariffs in the past. Trump has also made reworking trade with Mexico a top priority. With a cloud of uncertainty hanging over US-Mexico relations, Macri has a message for Mexico: Turn to us. “That is a great opportunity to turn around and look a bit more to South America,” Macri told CNN. “This shows that it’s better to keep and to deepen relationships with many other countries.”  Sunday Magazine sunday magazine aaj kal Business Plus TGIF Zaiqa TV Company Financials Investor Information Contact us Privacy Policy Terms and Conditions © 2017 DailyTimes - ALL RIGHTS RESERVED Powered By opustech.co

On how he felt on day 1 filming in Morden Sampha: Probably when I went into Morden Park around 6am with these huge trainers and about 20-30 people and it was all around a swimming pool I used to go to all the time. That was pretty weird. It was kind of hard to compute what was going on. So I kinda just went with the flow, took a deep breath and sort of gone on with the day but it was pretty crazy. Then going around Morden Train Station with these huge cameras and a whole team of people shooting. It was pretty weird but that being said everyone was kind of local, the people just walking past just like ‘I need to go on and have dinner’. On bumping into anyone in his hometown during the making Sampha: A couple of old friends and then he was like ‘Why Morden?’ I’m like ‘You live here too! Why not!’ On planning the idea and concept for the film Sampha: Yeah I guess the idea is always the hardest part. Khalil (Joseph), through conversation, had an idea of creating an omniverse where time and space lap over each other in terms of my grandparents time and my time and for it not to feel like it was set in one particular period. It wasn’t too hard to do but it was just coming up with that initial idea and then keeping things relatively with the fashion and set design and stuff. On the set design I guess they mostly kind of hired numerous people to help with the set design and sort of clothing. This guy called Abraham Kamara who lives in London but Sierra Leone born and he got to go back to Sierra Leone after not going for a long time. It was sort of just a collaboration between those people and I kind of got more involved during and near the time of shooting. On storyboarding the film We did to a degree and a lot of the narrative gets told or created in the edit. Khalil loves to film and take a look at the unexpected and go into a space and something else might make focus that wasn’t expected. He goes for whatever looks best. Setting up the environments to go film in but then after that its just a little bit of trial and error. On the significance of the bandstand in Morden and the Globe Theatre in Sierra Leone I guess the bandstand in Morden is just a place I used to go to when I was younger and sort of just loiter and hang around and The Globe cinema is the cinema my parents would go to and cousins and family in Sierra Leone and it just looks, it just looks like a lovely place even though its sort of dilapidated but it came across so well on film. How he got his grandmother to do the voice over on the film It wasn’t necessary getting her on board but I just asked if she was comfortable to be filmed and it wasn't anything obviously pre-written it was just kind of Khalil going to my grandmas place and filming her, maybe asking her a couple of questions. She’s in her late 80s. How his family in London and Sierra Leone felt about the project My brothers were really supportive in terms of me sharing some of the narratives that I’ve kind of shared in the film. They also got interviewed and in Sierra Leone the people were happy that something like that was being shot in Sierra Leone. I was happy I really wanted to show Sierra Leone in sort of its beauty or like in its extravagance. How he dealt with the scale of the project At times I was pinching myself a little bit because I was like ‘I can’t believe that this is sort of—happening’. On how the idea come about It was through Young Thug’s guys and I guess he knows like Larry Jackson over at Apple and actually I remember having a conversation with the guys a few years ago about me wanting to express these different sides of my identity and having a bit of an identity crisis in terms of connecting to the part of me that has grown up in England then my family coming from Sierra Leone. So I think the seed was sown a little while back but in terms of this but yeah it was a conversation between Young Thug and Apple and them thinking of a director to sort of help. On working with Kahlil Joseph It’s been really good. He’s so down to earth and made me feel very much at home and he really is just like an interesting guy. Asking me sort of questions that have kind of thrown me a bit he has a very unique way of viewing the world. I was a fan of his work before we actually met. We just met downtown and were having drinks and stuff and he has a very unique visual language. There’s no script but there’s definitely a narrative and there’s definitely the feeling I guess somewhat similar to how I write as well, lyrically or like in the production, I sort of set a scene and you might have to listen a little more or decode the metaphors to kind of fill your own picture. I definitely feel the visuals and the music kinda marry in that way. On his goals with the project The narratives are all quite simple in terms of like sharing how powerful love can be and sort of where that can take you in your life, the love of my grandparents and how that transcends into their love for me. My parents and my love for my mother and family so that bond. On whether the film and album fit together I guess they fit in some ways but they are definitely separate too I feel like visually the film definitely mirrors or kind of adds to the sonics. There’s a lot that was done that has really worked for me in terms of expressing sound in a visual way.

By Eileen Yu for By The Way | April 9, 2017 -- 01:23 GMT (18:23 PDT) | Topic: Smartphones Nokia smartphone-licensee is targeting to be the top Android smartphone player and betting on brand nostalgia in Asia as well as its focus on offering native Android services to fuel its ambition. HMD Global in May last year was awarded an exclusive 10-year license to develop, market, and sell Nokia devices including feature phones and smartphones, which would run Google's Android OS. The deal also included Nokia-branded feature phones sold by Microsoft over the past three years and Microsoft's manufacturing facility in Vietnam, which was acquired by Foxconn's subsidiary, FIH Mobile. Latest news on Asia Nokia bets on APAC nostalgia to drive smartphone comeback ​The G6 is fine, but now LG needs consistency or faces demise ​Samsung to launch Asiana Airlines edition Galaxy S8 ​LG to post second-highest operating profit for first quarter Samsung boss attends first hearing of bribery trial Nokia would receive royalties from every Nokia-branded device sold by HMD, a Finnish company set up in December 2015, in which Nokia was not a shareholder. Nokia had earmarked 2017 as the "brand's return to smartphones". To date, Nokia 6 was the only smartphone launched and available in China and Taiwan, while the low-end feature phone Nokia 150 was launched in India and Europe last December. Plans now were underway to introduce its products across Asia-Pacific in the second quarter of 2017, including the Nokia 3 and Nokia 5 smartphones, according to Flann Gao, HMD's Asia-Pacific communications director. Based in Singapore, which served as the company's regional headquarters, Gao told ZDNet it was targeting to launch most of its phones in all markets in the region, though, availability would depend on whether the local market was dependent on 2G or 3G networks. He acknowledged the mobile landscape had changed significantly since Nokia last reigned, with the Asia-Pacific region already crowded with global and local players including Xiaomi, Apple, and Samsung. He believed, though, that Nokia still had a unique opportunity to regain ground. Pointing to the strength of its brand, he said consumer awareness of the Nokia name in Asia-Pacific remained high despite the fact it had not released any products in the last few years. He added that consumer perception mostly was positive. Because it previously offered phones across a wide range of price-points, he noted that consumers in different market segments were receptive to the Nokia brand. This was not necessarily the case with other marker players, he said. Wider product mix will give competitive edge, but no plans beyond smartphones for now Clement Teo, principal analyst at Ovum, said Nokia could find a place in the mid-tier segment amid the crowded mobile market. "Producing a well-designed mid-market smartphone will allow them to be a strong alternative to the likes of other mid-market smartphone players like Huawei, Oppo, Samsung, and Xiaomi," Teo said in an email interview. He said the introduction of Nokia's N1 tablet in 2014 in selected Asian markets had sparked much anticipation about the vendor's return to the consumer market. He suggested that offering a mix of smartphones, tablets, and wearables--via Nokia's Withings acquisition--could provide the competitive edge it needed against major players that had an ecosystem of multiple gadgets, such as Sony and Apple. The analyst also pointed to Nokia's investment in IoT, particularly in digital healthcare, as a key market to watch. The Withings acquisition was key as Nokia took a more strategic approach to the consumer IoT market, which Teo said promised higher growth rates than the flattening smartphone and tablet segments. "Even though Nokia plans to capitalise on its brand in the smartphone segment by using third-party manufacturers, we expect IoT to be of higher priority," he said. Aggregating, processing, and redistributing health data captured by wearables, and potentially smartphones, could fuel Nokia's push into cloud-enabled digital healthcare, he noted. "In such a form, digital healthcare should be able to encompass not only consumer self-tracking, but also professional medical services." Nokia, though, would have to move quickly to keep up with competitors that also were making a play for the healthcare space, including Apple with HealthKit and Samsung's S Health. HMD, however, currently was focused on mobile phones and had no plans to launch tablets, yet, Gao said. Its license with Nokia included tablets, but not wearables. While feature phones were generating significant revenue, the company's long-term goal was to be the world's leading Android smartphone vendor, he said. He added that there were some 500 million to 600 million feature phones globally, with Nokia ranked the top or second-largest players in most major markets such as Vietnam, India, and several in Southeast Asia. Aim to lead with stock Android Noting that Asia-Pacific was a highly fragmented mobile market, Gao said HMD was aiming to take the lead in the Android world with its pledge to provide the platform "in the purest form", stripped of preloads and skins. Its phones would run stock Android, similar to Google's Pixel, which would ensure the devices received the monthly security updates from Google and the latest system updates. HMD's decision to work closely with partners such as Google as well as FIH Mobile, as its manufacturing partner, enabled the startup to operate on a leaner model and be more nimble, he said. It also would adhere to Nokia's brand guidance to ensure its phones reflected the latter's design history of being "very human", he added. "Our ambition is to be top Android smartphone player in the next few years." HMD's global base of "a few hundred employees" currently included product designers, product managers, and sales and marketing managers--many of whom, such as its chief marketing officer, formerly were from Nokia and Microsoft. The Finnish startup covered 100 markets across eight regions such as Asia, Europe, India, and China, and had 500 partners worldwide, including distributors, retailers, and telcos. Its team in Asia-Pacific comprised "several dozens" and the company was recruiting, Gao said, but would not specify the number of people he was looking to hire. He said the company had presence in almost all markets in the region, including offices in Australia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. HMD had singled out millennials and the younger generation as an important consumer segment that would help drive its success, he noted. When it launched Nokia 6 in China at the start of the year, partnering e-commerce operator JD.com, 76 percent of customers who bought the phone were millennials, he said. He declined to reveal sales figures for China, but said 1.3 million customer registered for the phone during the launch in January and its first batch of units sold out in 23 seconds. He said HMD chose to launch in the Chinese market first because it was highly competitive, accounting for half of the world's smartphone sales, and would offer valuable consumer feedback.

The tower, which has remained without an update for more than three years, is still available with the two base models retailing for $2,999 and $3,999. The lower-end model jumps from from a quad-core Xeon CPU to a 6-core one, and gets dual G500 GPUs (an upgrade over the G300 GPUs), while the step-up model gets an 8-core CPU (up from 6) and dual D700 GPUs (up from the D500). At present, there’s still no onboard USB-C and no Thunderbolt 3, which means it still won’t be able to run the LG UltraFine 5K display. Apple also stated that new, pro-level iMacs are due later this year. Apple has stated in past interviews with senior vice presidents Phil Schiller and Craig Federighi that “The current Mac Pro … was constrained thermally and it restricted our ability to upgrade it” and engineering, wherein the company has apparently “designed ourselves into a bit of a thermal corner, if you will.”). Executive apologized for users hoping for a major upgrade and stated that Apple is “completely rethinking the Mac Pro” with a new modular design that can accommodate high-end CPUs and GPUs, as well as Apple-branded pro displays to go with them. These improvements, per the quotes, won’t be available until next year. The company also stated that while its Mac user base is approaching 100 million users, only 20 percent of them use desktops. Of those, Mac Pro users make up a “single-digit percentage.” “We’re working on [a new Mac Pro],” Schiller said. “We have a team working hard on it right now, and we want to architect it so that we can keep it fresh with regular improvements, and we’re committed to making it our highest-end, high-throughput desktop system, designed for our demanding pro customers.” Stay tuned for additional details as they become available. And, the moment they do, I’ll proudly be snagging the new one, as I love my current Mac Pro beyond what might be considered rational… Via Macworld Tweet Share this: Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) More Click to print (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window) Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) Related Recent Posts Recently published patent application shows how Apple might incorporate Touch Bar, Touch ID functions into next-gen Magic Keyboard Rumor: Next-gen, modular Mac Pro may not be available until early 2019 Rumor: Apple to debut next-gen Apple Watch later this year, will take two-generation approach to models available Western Digital announces My Passport SSD, drive will feature USB-C functionality for Macs Apple begins offering refunds for customers who paid for the Workflow app 2 Responses to “Apple offers slight speed bump for current Mac Pro, hints at new models in 2018” drx, on April 5th, 2017 at 6:34 pm Said: Apple, long ago abandoned computers, traditional, upgradeable machines … of computation. Even the Mac Mini got the short end of the shaft … At one point there was a quad core Mac Mini option, with even an OK GPU … upgradable RAM, HDD/SDD/optical. My 2010 Mac Pro is running fine … highly upgraded, no thunderbolt and is way better than anything Apple currently has to offer. Certainly the late 2013 model can do some things better — if you need more 4K rendering options, yet I could even upgrade to a 12GB nVidia Titan video card, to get a few more options (CUDA processing) and in some cases better performance than the trash cans dual AMD 6GB GPUs … Apple abandoned computers … the professional market and really just about everything that made it great. iPhone are OK. One may even consider an iPhone a “computer” yet it is not nearly as good a “computer” when you need things only a older styled machine can perform. At least Apple never went the Windows 8/10 route. chris lewis, on April 6th, 2017 at 1:33 am Said: I share an irrational fondness for my 2010 Mac Pro. I’ve used G3, G4 and Intel “pro” machines for work and play for two decades and they have never caused me grief, apart from one hard drive clicking itself to death. That was my excuse to put two SSDs in a RAID on the PCI bus. zoom zoom zoom. As for Apple forsaking its “pro” user base, i seem to remember that the specs of the 2013 Mac Pro exceeded anything its competitors offered, ignoring price. And they are still pretty good today, better after Tuesday’s announcement. Some graphcs designer friends tried so-called “high-end” Windows machines to save a couple of thou$and. Cost them more in down time. They chucked them back in exchange for Mac Pros. I did not upgrade from my 2010 machine because of the 2013 Pro’s lack of expansion potential. But this news of next year’s revamp has me more than a little excited.

If so, good luck downloading it on your iPhone 5/5c or iPad 4. That’s because the free of charge video creation app lacks support for 32-bit iOS devices despite requiring the recently-released iOS 10.3, which in itself runs on 32-bit iOS devices. As first noted by AppleInsider, this could be interpreted as another sign that Apple will stop supporting 32-bit devices when iOS 11 releases later this year. “It is not exactly clear when Apple will completely drop support for 32-bit devices in the iOS itself,” writes the publication. “The omission of 32-bit device compatibility appears to be another step for the company in that direction.” In another sign that iOS 11 will make the end of the road for 32-bit apps and devices, Apple’s changed a warning about 32-bit apps on iOS 10.3. The reworded prompt now cautions users that using a 32-bit app will slow down their 64-bit device. TUTORIAL: How to identify 32-bit apps that are installed on your iOS device “This app will not work with future version of iOS,” reads the reworded prompt on iOS 10.3. Moreover, iOS 10.3 includes a new App Compatibility section within the Settings app that names and shames all 32-bit apps that are installed on your device. The following iOS devices are 64-bit: iPhone 5s/SE/6/6s/7 iPad Air and iPad Air 2 iPad mini 2, iPad mini 3 and iPad mini 4 Sixth-generation iPod touch 12.9-inch iPad Pro and 9.7-inch iPad Pro 9.7-inch iPad (2017) Last but not least, iOS 10.3.1 has brought back the ability to update 32-bit iPhone, iPad and iPod touch devices over the air though owners of iPhone 5, iPhone 5c and iPad 4 were always able to update their legacy hardware through iTunes. This is interesting in and of itself because the iOS 10.3.2 beta currently lacks 32-bit device support. Subscribe to iDownloadBlog on YouTube According to Apple, the Clips app requires iOS 10.3 and supports iPhone 5s and later, 9.7-inch iPad (2017), all iPad Air and iPad Pro models, iPad mini 2 and later and sixth-generation iPod touch. Clips is a free download from App Store. Have you tried out Clips yet?

Anonymouse Hey angry ant, when I wrote you must be new here, that was a tongue in cheek response to who writes like that. If you have been here for over one month let alone one year you’d have noticed that this authors articles are to put it eloquently, riddled with shite. So if anyone questions this authors writing style I’d automatically assume the reader must be new to iDB. Understand? Now pull your head in. Timothy No, he seems to be everywhere, unfortunately. Timothy Seriously dude, what’s your problem? You always point out “mistakes” in these articles that aren’t even there… I have seen dozens of your comments on iDB and I don’t think a single one has been positive. If you hate the site so much, why do you keep reading it?? Agneev Point out my mistake, if you can! Anonymouse I don’t think he was pointing out a mistake. Rather was pointing out the manner in which the author was advising readers by wishing them good luck in downloading an app that can’t be downloaded on older 32 bit devices. Like saying to a blind man, good luck watching the sun set. If I’m not mistaken English is the second language for the author, however sensitivity isn’t affected by that fact, nor is immaturity.

Squarespace's flash new Dublin office The US web design firm recently pulled back the curtains on its European base. By Fora Staff Monday 10 Apr 2017, 6:00 AM 2 hours ago 6,325 Views 4 Comments http://jrnl.ie/3331525 Share Tweet Email Image: Donal Murphy Image: Donal Murphy IF YOU LISTEN to any podcast, you have probably heard the now-ubiquitous ads for US web design firm Squarespace - a company that had humble beginnings in a college dorm room. Some 14 years on from its foundation, the company has taken big strides – among others, opening its first international office in Dublin. Recently, Squarespace’s head of EMEA operations, Rapha Fontes, gave Fora a tour of the company’s plush new digs at Le Pole House in the city centre. Source: Fora.ie/YouTube Squarespace moved into the four-floor building in November 2014, but staff had been desk-hopping until late last year as ongoing works slowly brought the building up to tech-chic spec. Fontes wouldn’t reveal the final bill for the project, which was overseen by New York architects A+I – the same firm that handled the kit-out for Squarespace’s Big Apple HQ. However, he said the company stuck to a very “minimalistic aesthetic” for the Irish outpost - with only plants bringing a dash of color to the space. That said, “minimalistic” doesn’t necessarily mean boring. The architects also fitted out the office with a video games room and ping-pong table area, while each floor also got its own theme. The fourth floor – which consisted of five, closed offices when Squarespace moved in - was overhauled completely. Fontes said all the walls were torn down to make way for a lunch area with a catered kitchen, open seating area and beer on tap. Opening up the top floor also gave the whole workforce access to the balcony area, which has been set up with hammocks - so people can doze in the sun after lunch, if the Irish weather permits, according to Fontes. Irish presence Squarespace, which saw its revenue hit $200 million last year, has been in the Irish capital since 2013 and moved between several different offices before it settled in the location just off Georges Street. There are 115 people working at the Irish operation now, handling more than a third of the company’s international customer support. Squarespace's video games room Source: Donal Murphy Fontes told Fora that staff numbers at the company’s Dublin office are set to swell over the next few years and could hit the 300 mark soon.

Illustration: Errata Carmona for The Wall Street Journal By Gerrard Cowan Updated April 9, 2017 10:56 p.m. ET 0 COMMENTS “Green bond” issuance is growing fast, part of the overall trend of do-good investments becoming more popular. And U.S. fund companies are looking to tap into investor demand for these bonds, which finance environmentally friendly projects from green infrastructure and real-estate development to energy-efficiency initiatives. About $81 billion of green bonds were issued last year, according to the Climate Bonds Initiative, a nonprofit that promotes the debt market as a way to raise money for projects related to climate change. It expects $150 billion of green bonds to be issued this year, compared with just $3 billion were issued in 2012. These figures cover “labeled” green bonds, meaning they have been reviewed externally and meet certain definitions, including those of the Climate Bonds Initiative.

Stock Analysts’ Biases Are Showing U.S.-Stock Funds Rose 4.8% in Quarter Do You Know Bitcoin? How ‘T’ Shares Will Work A range of private and government organizations have issued green bonds, from Apple Inc. AAPL -0.22% and Toyota Motor Corp. TM 0.39% to municipalities, New York’s Metropolitan Transportation Authority and the governments of France and Poland. They have proved popular with investors, with most of the issues oversubscribed, according to the Climate Bonds Initiative. “These are no longer niche investments,” says Neena Mishra, director of ETF research at Zacks Investment Research. The growth of the market has sparked interest from fund companies, with the first U.S.-listed exchange-traded fund focused on green bonds—the VanEck Vectors Green Bond ETF (GRNB)—launched in March. The ETF was launched to meet growing investor demand for environmentally focused products, says Edward Lopez, head of ETF product management at VanEck, an investment-management firm based in New York. The green-bond market has grown large enough in recent years to allow for an ETF to be listed, he says. The fund tracks the S&P Green Bond Select Index, which was launched by S&P Dow Jones Indices last month to track the most liquid segment of the broader S&P Green Bond Index. The S&P Green Bond Index had an annualized return of negative 0.81% over the five years through the end of March, compared with negative 0.39% for its parent index, the S&P Global Aggregate Developed ex-Collateralized Index, which tracks the performance of a broad range of investment-grade debt around the world. The VanEck ETF was launched on the heels of the Mirova Global Green Bond fund (MGGYX), a mutual fund that launched in late February. Mirova, a subsidiary of Natixis Asset Management that focuses on sustainable investment, had already launched a green-bond fund in Europe, the Mirova Green Bond-Global fund. In demand “Both institutional plan sponsors and wealth-management advisers are hearing demands from their participants and clients for investments with positive impact,” says Kenneth St. Amand, vice president and client portfolio manager at Mirova, explaining the impetus behind the Mirova funds. The two new U.S.-listed funds join Calvert Green Bond fund (CGAFX), a $74 million mutual fund that was launched in October 2013 by Calvert Investments, one of the original sustainable-investing firms. The Calvert fund takes a broad approach, investing both in labeled green bonds and in the bonds of companies it considers to be leaders on environmental issues. For example, the fund will buy any bond issued by Apple—even if a bond doesn’t finance an environmentally friendly project—because of the tech giant’s efforts to reduce its carbon footprint, says Vishal Khanduja, the fund’s portfolio manager. However, the fund’s makeup has changed over the years, Mr. Khanduja says. The percentage represented by green bonds has increased with the growth in their issuance, so that they now account for more than half of the fund’s assets. Bigger in Europe The U.S. is behind Europe in the listing of green-bond funds; there are several in Europe that aren’t open to U.S. investors. That includes the Lyxor Green Bond UCITS ETF, launched in late February by Lyxor Asset Management, part of the Paris-based Société Générale Group , which just beat VanEck’s GRNB as the world’s first green-bond ETF. There are numerous Europe-based mutual funds focused on green bonds, including the Allianz Green Bond fund, the AXA WF Planet Bonds fund and NN Investment Partners’ NN (L) Euro Green Bond fund. BlackRock Inc. BLK 0.50% launched a Europe-listed Green Bond Index fund in March, while State Street Corp.’s STT -0.13% State Street Global Advisors operates the State Street Global Green Bond Index fund in Europe. Europe has shown greater interest in the green-bond market than the U.S., in terms of both issuance and investor demand, says Chris McKnett, head of State Street Global Advisor’s global environmental, social and governance, or ESG, investments business. He points to several reasons, including the relatively early issuance of green bonds on the continent by organizations like the European Investment Bank in 2007 and the World Bank in 2008, which helped foster an investor base.

About 37% of the green bonds outstanding, by face value, are denominated in euros, according to the Climate Bonds Initiative, the most for any currency. Mr. McKnett says that bodes well for the market’s further development there, because potential issuers will be confident the market can support new supply. Still, the number of U.S. dollar-denominated green bonds has grown quickly over the past year or so, and they now account for 36% of the global total. Mr. McKnett says State Street would consider launching a U.S. fund, “given the increasing level of awareness and burgeoning state of the market.” Brown Advisory, an investment-management company based in Baltimore, is aiming to launch a mutual fund focused on green bonds before the end of this year, says Thomas Graff, head of fixed income. Brown Advisory currently includes green bonds in a number of the accounts it manages for it clients. “I believe that more and more investors are going to be thinking about sustainability issues,” Mr. Graff says. Broader choices One potential drawback of mutual funds and ETFs focused on green bonds is that they still have a relatively narrow universe to choose from, despite the recent growth of the market, says Jon Hale, head of sustainability research at fund tracker Morningstar Inc. In New York, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority has issued several large green bonds in the past year. Photo: iStockphoto/Getty Images There are other funds that take a broader approach and therefore have a greater range of bonds to choose from, while retaining an ESG theme, Mr. Hale says. He points to the TIAA-CREF Social Choice Bond Fund (TSBRX), a $1.1 billion fund that invests primarily in intermediate-term investment-grade bonds that meet certain ESG criteria, in areas from affordable housing to renewable energy. Still, the green-bond market looks set to continue growing, and the new mutual funds and ETFs are crucial in opening access to individual investors, as well as raising the profile of climate change as an issue, says Sean Kidney, chief executive of the Climate Bonds Initiative. “Once you own a green bond, you also start engaging with the whole issue,” he says. “You start thinking ‘There are solutions, I can do something.’ ” Mr. Cowan is a writer in Northern Ireland.

Photo: Brendan McDermid/Reuters By Mark Hulbert Updated April 9, 2017 11:00 p.m. ET 0 COMMENTS Index funds are going to become even harder to beat than they already are. That is because we are increasingly becoming a “winner take all” economy dominated by a relatively few big players. Since no one has shown the ability to determine in advance who these winners will be, much less predict when one era’s winners will stumble and be eclipsed by the next generation’s, owning all stocks is the only realistic strategy for avoiding owning a portfolio of losers. Journal Report Insights from The Experts Read more at WSJ.com/FundsETFs More in Investing in Funds & ETFs Should We Invest Social Security Money in Stocks? Stock Analysts’ Biases Are Showing U.S.-Stock Funds Rose 4.8% in Quarter Do You Know Bitcoin? How ‘T’ Shares Will Work “Networking effects” are driving the winner-take-all economic shift, according to Geoffrey Parker, a professor of engineering at Dartmouth College. These effects come into play, Prof. Parker says, whenever a company’s users create value for other users. An illustration is Apple Inc.’s AAPL -0.22% dominance of the smartphone industry: As more people buy iPhones, the more developers want to develop apps for those phones. And the more good iPhone apps there are, the more people want to buy those phones. These networking effects create a “virtuous cycle” in which one, or perhaps a handful of companies, eventually dominates the competition. Networking effects themselves aren't new, Prof. Parker notes. But in the past, they were constrained by high transaction costs. To use another phone analogy, from a century ago, growth of the early telephone network at first was slow because it was expensive to add new users, and placing a call required a human intermediary. Fast forward to today, Prof. Parker says, and “transaction costs are plummeting, allowing network effects to become paramount.” This virtuous cycle shows up particularly in a widening of profit margins at dominant firms. That is because, as Prof. Parker points out, “a lot of the cost structure of networked firms is fixed.” So just as these dominant firms’ revenue is growing as they attract more users, their profits margins are expanding markedly as well. Attention on Snap Investors are clearly betting that Snap Inc. SNAP 1.22% will be one of the next big winners. At its initial public offering price on the New York Stock Exchange in early March, the company known for its popular disappearing-message app Snapchat was trading at a sky-high price-to-sales ratio of almost 50. That was higher than any other large-company IPO in U.S. history, according to Jay Ritter, a finance professor at the University of Florida (defining a large company as having at least $200 million in inflation-adjusted sales). And Snap today is trading even higher than where it came to market. Note carefully that the shift toward a winner-take-all economy merely makes it possible that Snap will live up to the huge growth expectations implicit in its high price/sales figure—not probable. In fact, Prof. Ritter points out, the shift actually makes it likely that Snap will fail to generate the profits necessary to justify a $20 billion valuation, since by definition there are more losers than winners in the winner-take-all economy. In any case, the winner-take-all shift has been accelerating in recent years. Take the percentage of total income at publicly traded U.S. corporations that is earned by the top 100 firms. This percentage grew to 52.8% from 48.5% between 1975 and 1995, according to research conducted by finance professors Kathleen Kahle of the University of Arizona and Rene Stulz of Ohio State. Over the subsequent 20 years, it mushroomed to 84.2%. That means that the overwhelming majority of publicly traded corporations in the U.S. earn either modest profits or actually lose money. A related development is the drop in the number of publicly traded firms. It peaked at more than 7,500 in the late 1990s, according to Profs. Kahle and Stulz, and by 2015 stood at 3,766. Indeed, the professors wonder if we may be witnessing the coming to pass of a forecast made in 1989 by Harvard Business School’s Michael Jensen, who predicted the “demise of the public corporation.” Investor impact There are a host of broader implications of these developments for economic policy makers as well as long-term consequences for investors. Harry Deangelo, a professor of finance and business economics at the University of Southern California, says that in a winner-take-all economy, it is more important than ever to invest in a portfolio of all stocks. Only in that way can you be assured of owning the winning companies’ stocks and not a basket of mediocre or losing companies, he says. Journal Report Podcast Subscribe to the Journal Report podcast at wsj.com, on iTunes or Google Play Music. Another consequence of the shift is greater volatility at the level of the individual stock. A single misstep by an erstwhile winner can have an outsize influence by triggering an exit of previously loyal users—which could in turn lead to an “unvirtuous cycle” downward. Dartmouth’s Prof. Parker illustrates this point by asking us to imagine what would happen to Apple’s stock if its next iPhone release is a flop. The typical stock’s exaggerated vulnerability to even slight changes in the way the wind is blowing is also illustrated by the growing percentage of the stock market’s combined value that comes from intangibles. According to Ocean Tomo, a firm that focuses on intellectual property, 84% of the S&P 500’s market value now comes from intangible assets. In 1975 it was just 17%. More stocks needed Another reason to own all stocks: According to Martin Lettau, a finance professor at the University of California, Berkeley, even though the typical individual stock has become more volatile in recent years, the overall market hasn’t. This is because individual stocks’ greater volatilities offset each other, Prof. Lettau says, with the bigger zigs of one stock balancing out the larger zags of another. As a consequence, he says, investors today need to own a much larger number of stocks than investors in previous generations to construct a stock portfolio that is no more volatile than the overall market. The easiest way to become adequately diversified, of course, is by investing in an index fund. Index funds also are the cheapest ways for individual investors to do that. Schwab recently lowered the expense ratio on its ETF that is benchmarked to the entire U.S. stock market, Schwab U.S. Broad Market ETF (SCHB). It now costs just 0.03% a year, or $3 per $10,000 invested. Vanguard’s Total Stock Market ETF (VTI), is only barely behind with an expense ratio of 0.05%.

News Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Obituaries E-Edition DMG Rewards Jobs Cars Homes Classifieds log in Site Archive Troy Wolverton: No great options for protecting online privacy Monday Apr 10, 2017 at 12:01 AM Troy Wolverton The (San Jose, Calif.) Mercury News @troywolv Now that Congress has given internet service providers the green light to keep tabs on your online activities and do as they wish with that information, you might be wondering what you can do about it. The good news is there are two different technical tools you can use — the Tor system and virtual private networks, or VPNs. The bad news is both tools can be difficult to use and VPNs can be costly. The even worse news is that both, but particularly VPNs, may pose an even bigger risk to your privacy and security than your broadband provider’s prying eyes. “Those two are the best technological solutions we have,” said Kevin Riggle, a cybersecurity professional who previously worked at web company Akamai Technologies. But, he added, “neither of them are good solutions.” Many consumers have found themselves looking for a good privacy solution following the recent passage by Congress of a resolution that would overturn privacy rules voted in place last year by the Federal Communications Commission. Those rules, which were due to take effect later this year, would have required broadband providers to seek customer approval before collecting or sharing information about them or their online activities. It would have also required companies to take “reasonable” steps to protect the data they collected and to alert customer if that data had been compromised by hackers. Perhaps the most popular answer for consumers is to sign up for a VPN. A virtual private network is a service that connects your computer or other device with a server on the internet. VPN services typically encrypt all the traffic between your computer or device and their servers and routes all of your online traffic — web browsing, email, videos — through those servers before sending it on to its eventual destination. Because your data is scrambled, your broadband provider typically can’t see what sites you’re visiting or what you’re doing online when you use a VPN. They also can’t see what’s in your email or what’s on the websites you’re visiting. All they can generally see is that you are connecting to a private network. Most VPNs are available for desktop computers and both Android and Apple smartphones. Some can be connected directly to your internet router so that all traffic through your home network passes through them. And if you’re really geeky, you can set up your own VPN using open source software called Algo that will run on your own server or on a cloud service like Amazon’s EC2. But VPNs aren’t a perfect solution for protecting privacy. They can be difficult to configure and use. They can slow your access to online sites and services. And because security experts strongly advise users to stay away from free VPNs, you can expect to spend between $3 and $13 a month to use one. More disturbingly, you may be less secure using a VPN than you would be otherwise. Security experts have noted that the encryption keys used by some popular virtual private networks are known and easily broken, meaning it wouldn’t be hard for someone to snoop on data you sent through them. Potentially much worse, by using a VPN, you may be swapping the devil you know for the devil you don’t, giving the VPN provider a God’s eye view of your online activities. While many networks promise to protect your privacy and not keep track of what you do on the internet, most are black boxes and almost none of their claims have been independently verified, security experts warn. “You basically have to have faith in them that they’re telling the truth,” said Paul Bischoff, an editor at Comparitech, a website that reviews privacy and security products. Security experts like Bischoff recommend that you do plenty of research before signing up for a VPN. Scrutinize their privacy policies and terms of service to see what data they collect, how long they hold on to it and what they do with it. Check to see if they are using secure encryption keys. And see if there are any press reports about how they’ve responded to subpoenas or other legal requests that they turn over data. The other option is to use Tor, which works kind of like a multistage VPN. Tor routes your online data through multiple servers and encrypts it along the way. So, like a regular VPN, it obscures your online activities from your broadband provider; all that provider can detect is that you are using Tor. But Tor also helps shield your activities from the servers through which your data passes. And the last server in the chain, the one that connects you to your destination, doesn’t know your internet address, so it can’t tell who is trying to reach that site. Unlike many VPNs, Tor is free to use and it’s something of a gold standard in shielding online activity. But it too has its shortcomings. Because online traffic sent through Tor goes through multiple servers, it can be painfully slow to use, so much so that it’s typically not good to use if you’re trying to stream videos or wanting to compete with other people head-to-head in online games. Some sites even block Tor users. Tor is typically accessed through a custom web browser. Although you can configure your computer to route your traffic through the Tor network, that’s much more difficult for the average user to do. And if you’re on an iPhone, it’s basically impossible. An app called Orbot allows Android users to connect to the Tor network and use multiple apps through it. But if you use an iPhone, your only Tor options are web browsers. And Tor could have security problems. There have been reports that the National Security Administration and even malicious hackers are monitoring traffic on the network, and the use of Tor could draw more attention to users than they would otherwise get. “Tor is by far the best thing we have available today,” said Riggle. “But that’s far from saying it’s perfect.” Indeed, when it comes to protecting your activities from your broadband provider, the best solution is not a technical one but a political one — the one the FCC already came up with, and that Republicans in Congress have now chucked out the window.

And decent ones at that! ZTE sub-brand nubia has just announced the nubia Z17 mini and while its specs and design might not completely impress, for its price you are promised an acceptable, though perhaps not superb, twin 13 megapixel shooters of your own in the tradition of Huawei and Apple. There are different, or at least two, ways to do dual cameras. The one popularized by Huawei is to have one regular RGB sensor paired with a monochrome sensor, the latter tasked with gathering more contrast and depth data. The nubia Z17 mini uses this implementation as well with one slight difference. Huawei’s dual cameras, like many of its kind, are usually uneven. One sensor has more megapixels than the other, usually the monochrome one. In ZTE’s case, however, both have 13 megapixel f/2.2 sensors. The nubia Z17 mini’s front camera is no slouch either, with a larger 16 megapixel sensor and an equally larger f/2.0 aperture. So if the dual cameras weren’t enough for your photography taste buds, the obviously selfie-oriented front camera might be. The rest of the nubia Z17 mini’s specs, however, are somewhat less impressive. It’s a midrange smartphone through and through, though with a slightly higher caliber. There are two configurations, one with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 652 processor with 4 GB of RAM and another with a Snapdragon 653 with 6 GB of RAM. In both configurations, there is 64 GB of expandable storage and a 5.2-inch 1920×1080 screen. ZTE is reportedly eying a launch of the nubia Z17 mini in Europe and India, and perhaps even in the US in the foreseeable future. No price details for international markets have been confirmed yet, but in China, the Z17 mini is going for 1,699 CNY ($250) and 1,999 CNY ($290) for the 4 GB and 6 GB RAM models, respectively.

Features Reviews Phones Android iPhone Windows Phone Apps Computers Laptops Lenovo Tablets Windows Tutorials Events More Audio Crowfunding Design/Concepts Gadgets Gaming General Photo/Video Web Ubergizmo in French Ubergizmo in German Ubergizmo in Italian Ubergizmo in Spanish iPhone 8 Rumored To Sport Smart Connector By Tyler Lee on 04/09/2017 17:34 PDT Last year ahead of the iPhone 7’s launch, it was rumored that the handset could sport the iPad Pro’s Smart Connector feature, although we guess those rumors did not pan out. However according to the latest rumors, it has been suggested that the Smart Connector might make an appearance for 2017’s iPhone 8. This rumor comes courtesy of The Verifier (via 9to5Mac) who claims that the iPhone 8 will feature the Smart Connector feature. The connection is said to help facilitate “wireless” charging and will also support VR/AR accessories, although we’re not sure which, unless the report means that Apple will launching their own set of VR/AR accessories. Given that Apple tends to share its technology across its products, the idea that maybe Apple could some day transition to using the Smart Connector on its iPhone lineup doesn’t really seem like a stretch. However whether or not it will debut with the iPhone 8 and whether or not it will be used for wireless charging and/or VR/AR accessories is a different story. However we have heard that Apple could be introducing wireless charging for the iPhone 8 this year, which along with new hardware features like an OLED display could account for its higher-than-normal price tag.

Shop: Surface Studio | New Surface Book | Xbox One S Bundles | NEW Dell XPS 13" Under consideration New Surface design patent suggests Microsoft is considering USB Type-C for power By Daniel Rubino Sunday, Apr 9, 2017 at 4:25 pm EDT 77 Comments A recent design patent shows an apparent Type-C port and more for the Surface. Design patents sometimes offer insight into where a company may be steering its technology. Alternatively, the company may just be locking in an idea to prevent the competition from lifting it. Whether this new Microsoft design patent for the Surface dated March 28, 2017, is going into actual production is unclear, but none of the observed changes would be unexpected. The design patent in question is US d782,469 S and was initially filed on March 30, 2015, but updated a few weeks ago with some new drawings. As a design patent, no technical specifications are noted on the Surface, but there are some apparent changes from previous filings e.g. US D680,530 S0 (PDF). The two distinct alterations are the removal of the Surface Connector for powering the tablet and moving the standard headphone jack from the upper left side to the lower right one. The idea of Microsoft moving away from a limited proprietary AC adapter to a standardized USB Type-C – preferably with full Thunderbolt 3 support – is very much in line with most manufacturers these days. Even Apple famously surrendered its MagSafe power adapter with its new MacBook Pro laptops. Not only can USB Type-C act as the power port on a PC or tablet, but if configured for Thunderbolt 3 it can be used for data, peripherals, external GPUs, and powering 4K displays. Additionally, it's physically smaller than Microsoft's "fin" Surface Connector. Of course, for the drawing it could also just be "generic port". The other shift with the headphone jack also makes sense. One minor complaint about the current Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book is the headset jack location. It's a little odd to have headphones connected to the top of the tablet with the cord having more hang area. The moving of the jack to the lower side while not monumental would be a welcomed modification. Keeping all the I/O to one side would also be a nice aesthetic design. Finally, it does look like the USB Type-A and Mini-DisplayPort are also represented in the updated Surface design patents suggesting they will remain. Surface Pro 4 refresh or something else? Whether Microsoft implements port changes for the rumored Surface Pro 4 hardware upgrade remains to be seen. Caution needs to be taken that a design patent in and of itself is not a "leak" confirming the existence or any approved plans by Redmond. Indeed, there is nothing in the design patent that denotes USB Type-C making this strictly inference and therefore, unreliable as proof of anything. Also, instead of Surface Pro 4 redux, Microsoft could be saving this either for a real Surface Pro 4 successor or perhaps for a non-Pro Surface running Windows 10 Cloud, which may be forthcoming. Recent rumors suggest we may hear more about a new Surface in early May perhaps related to the Build developer conference. That refresh could bring minor changes (like above) along with 7th Gen Intel "Kaby Lake" processors for improved performance and battery life. None of that would at all be surprising. For now, we'll just have to chew on the possibility that Microsoft may be at least considering another adjustment to the Surface line, one that we think most people will welcome.

Magnetic connectors like it keep devices safe when you trip on them. Plus they just look really cool snapping into the port automatically. 26 10 hours ago Reply mbrdev I've only had my surface about a week now and while the power connector is a million times better than my Surface RT one and all my other laptop connectors I think I would still prefer USB-C, I guess I just like the whole "one port to rule them all" mantra. Would be nice if USB-C was magnetic though. 11 9 hours ago Reply Austin Andelin Check this out: https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B06XG1NB2K/ref=mp_s_a_1_5/145-6435096-088... -1 9 hours ago Reply Austin Andelin USB c magnetic cable 0 9 hours ago Reply Ecurb87 All that and all you had to say was "I'd prefer a magnetic USB-C port."

I love the convenience and safety of it. Super easy to attach and detach, AND looks futuristic. 2 6 hours ago Reply TPoole95 Compare these pictures to a non pro Surface 3 and I think your conclusion may change a little bit 6 9 hours ago Reply SvenJ Was going to say just that, sitting here with my Surface 3 with the DP, USB, micro USB charge, and headphone jack down the right side. Wouldn't mind it if this was a Surface 4 with USB-C charge as opposed to micro-usb. Would like a continuous hinge, rather than the 3 position, and a keyboard with a fingerprint reader (or camera Hello, but that would likely bump the price). All in all I like my Surface 3 as a personal device. Better than an iPad for sure. Other leaks have already pretty much confirmed any new Surface Pro and Book device will retain the same Surface connector, at least for the next iteration. Nothing says a new Surface couldn't have a USB-C as well, which could be used for charging too. We have a Dell XPS 15 that has the usual charger with the barrel connector. We have a Dell dock that connects via USB-C and yes, it charges the Dell as well as providing all the dock outputs. That would be a way MS could painlessly transition folks who still have Surface connector based hardware, chargers/docks. You phase out the old peripherals and phase in the new while both work on the next Surface. 2 7 hours ago Reply DJCBS If they remove the Surface Connector that will present them with a serious problem which is breaking the committment they made regarding support in future devices for the new (good but overpriced) Surface Dock. Not to mention that would mean they spent tons of research money on the Surface Dock connector to then throw it all away. Why spend time and resources in developing a cord that can serve as a one-stop connection for charging and data transfer if they then go ahead and just put in USB-C? USB-C was already available when the SP4 and the Surface Dock were released. And how will they entice people to go along with it? Will they provide Surface Dock ownsers with a free adapter to transfor the Surface Connector into a USB-C connector (like they did on the One S with the Kinect adapter)?     I'd rather wait and see. I absolutely hate USB-C and so I would never buy an SP5 to replace my SP3 just because of it. In fact, it would be a reason for me to skip it. Then again, I can't think of anything Microsoft could do on the SP5 to improve it over the SP3 for me, maybe apart from going with an almost bezel-less display. -7 9 hours ago Reply Krystianpants Yah all those people who spent money on VHS are just throwing it away by releasing bluray. 2 9 hours ago Reply DJCBS Don't be daft. The difference is that Microsoft actually said the Dock would serve future devices. 0 6 hours ago Reply Mister Burns They said the next gen of devices when the sp3 was out meaning they held that commitment 2 2 hours ago Reply MrElectrifyer Yeah they never made any other commitments with the Surface Pro 4, only with the Surface Pro 3 dock... 0 1 hour ago Reply Mister Burns Exactly 0 1 hour ago Reply saeed al amoudi they could get out of this problem by offering separate dongle. Usb type C with surface connector usb type C much powerful and it is the future 1 9 hours ago Reply LondonLumia Personally, whilst almost bezel-less 'Infinity' type displays would appear cool on a tablet, functionally they seem worse off. Maybe not in all uses, but if you were gripping the Surface like a clipboard or holding it up at an angle in your hands, hardly any bezels could cause you to accidentally tap a myriad of different things onscreen as you try to hold it securely. Plus, leaving space at the top of the front for the camera/sensors/speakers and at the bottom for the magnetic connection of the keyboard, you'd only significantly lessen the bezels on the sides - that'd look weird in both portrait and landscape orientations as a tablet, in my mind at least. The SP4 seems to have hit the sweet spot with the bezels. 3 9 hours ago Reply MrElectrifyer Agreed regarding the bezels. The Surface Pro 4's bezels are slim enough already. Going bezeless doesn't make sense in Tablet, where else would you hold it? Can't wrap your hand around it... 0 7 hours ago Reply DJCBS I completely understand the concerns regarding holding the tablet portion and the cameras. They're absolutely valid. However, I was only thinking about my case (as I wrote). In my case, they wouldn't be problems as I am amongst the majority who doesn't use the SP as a tablet. The only time the keyboard ever comes off is when I'm drawing on it and there the bezels don't offer any advantage. In the contrary. 0 6 hours ago Reply ThePyrobri Only if you haven't read about the possibility of a virtual bezel. Whereby the border for physical input when in certain modes is restricted to prevent exactly such issues. Win Central reported on exactly such a thing within the past few weeks. Beat of both worlds then.. 2 4 hours ago Reply MrElectrifyer That would be damn right awesome! But only if it's on an OLED display (similar to what Samsung did on the S8) or perhaps Microsoft could be the first to implement this IPS LCD alternative to OLED ( https://goo.gl/I9JqEO ) in a consumer product...we shall see how Panos advances the Surface Pro. 0 2 hours ago Reply Jf.Vigor Can you explain your issues with usb type c? Never heard anyone complain 4 9 hours ago Reply SvenJ Seconded. What's the beef? Have it on a number of phones, and on a Dell XPS 15. The USB-C based dock for that thing works every bit as well as the dock for the Surface. Better actually, as I can plug my Dell into my MS Display Dock (for my Lumia) and the USB and HDMI work fine. Plugging the Lumia 950 into the Dell dock, actually kinda works too. USB and ethernet work, HDMI doesn't. Don't know if that is the phone or dock's fault.  In any case, standards, dude. Embrace them.  0 7 hours ago Reply DJCBS Well, apart from the dubious reliability, it doesn't offer me enough an advantage that justifies going around replacing every single connector I have (cables etc) with USB-C...

I can certainly accept that USB-C doesn't offer you enough advantage to upgrade for that reason specifically but to say that you "absolutely hate" USB-C for that reason is ridiculous. 1 5 hours ago Reply MrElectrifyer Oh, going completely USB Type C in this day and age is nothing but a stupid move on a productivity device, no doubt about that. How it's meant to be is that USB Type C simply replaces MicroUSB and Mini DisplayPorts on the Surface line of products, and to be a real practical gain over those two ports, it should be fully Thunderbolt 3 capable, similar to what the ASUS Transformer Pro 3 offers ( https://is.gd/JqZnjr ) 0 59 min ago Reply bleached You will get over it. Everything will be USB-C in a couple years. 0 7 hours ago Reply DJCBS In 10 years, probably. Whilst I can keep away from them, I will. -1 6 hours ago Reply astondg The reason I really like the Surface port we have now is because it's a single port to dock for power, display & USB devices. Which is exactly what USB Type C offers as well and why I like it. I do wish that USB Type C was magnetic though, I can't understand why it isn't. But I have to then weigh up cross device compatibility against the magnetic convenience and USB Type C means I can dock both my Surface Pro & my Lumia 950 (with continuum!) via the same dock/cable, for example. So I'm okay with USB Type C (but still disappointed that it's not magnetic). 0 5 hours ago Reply Chemilinski The PDF linked in the article is the Surface RT :s Edit: Ah, you use it as an example. 0 9 hours ago Reply Hanley Gibbons The scale of the ports and kickstand indent don't match the Surface Pro 4's. This seems to be significantly shorter. My guess is that this is a design patent for the Surface 5 (as the Surface 3 was smaller than the Pro series). The upgrade from a standard Micro USB to a USB Type-C would make sense. I wouldn't be surprised to see this come out with an ARM processor, meanwhile the Pro series maintains the same 12 inch size, the magnetic Surface Connector, and the Intel chips. 6 9 hours ago Reply noirsoft I just compared to my Surface 3, and you may be right. The pic looks exactly like a Surface 3. The headphone port is already in that spot as well. Other reasons why this is probably a "Surface 4" and not a "Pro 5" Strip along top with camera and single microphone hole (vs camera hole and two mics for Pro 4 being integrated into main case) No vents along top halves of case. Only the bottom half with kickstand has gap. Diagonal indent above MicroSD slot matches Surface 3 exactly. The 3rd pic of Pro 4 shows how different it looks from similar angle as first patent drawing. https://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US/pdp/productID.5072641000 5 8 hours ago Reply Hanley Gibbons That and the distinct lack of vents for cooling means this must be a low power chip; which further suggests Core M or ARM chipset. 6 8 hours ago Reply Arquimaes Isn't it too early to have Windows on ARM available? x86 Surface 5 looks more sensible to me. Also, good job catching it was a Surface 3. Love mine and there's no doubt about its silouette. 1 6 hours ago Reply Hanley Gibbons Not necessarily. It's already complete and they're just optimizing, and a patent this recent makes me think that even if they announce it at upcoming hardware event, it won't be available until late summer or early fall which is when Windows on ARM is supposed to come out anyway. 0 5 hours ago Reply John McIlhinney What processor would an x86 Surface 5 use? I think that the reason that we didn't see a Surface 4 was that Intel cancelled their high-end Atoms so I don't see a candidate right now. 0 5 hours ago Reply Gregory Newman this is not a bad idea keep the old connector for power and the USB 3 port to connect up  old devices and a stand alone USB "C"  commector to handle high speed new devixes devices.

I don't see how running Win32 apps on phones is going to make any difference whatsoever. Microsoft already rules the desktop where Win32 belongs and phones is a lost race. And no one needs to run Adobe Lightroom on a phone.

Every other company has begun moving to that standard, so it would seem out of place for Microsoft not to offer it on their "Halo" product. It also opens the possibility for third party docks and external GPU's, a win for the consumer.  0 7 hours ago Reply gourav mopidevi Obvious 0 7 hours ago Reply ksmithservices Another way to tell...would be to compare this to patents for SP1-4. Because you'll be able to see if the port is the same. This proving It's a generic representation. Additionally... If they do offer thunderbolt... There should be two USB 3 or two Type-C.

Having it on the right tends to interfere with my mouse operation...but I guess I could just route it through the back of the device. As for USB Type C replacing the Surface Connector port, that's a downgrade IMO, unless Microsoft themselves provide a long magnetic USB type C charger in the box. I just want the Mini DisplayPort on the Surface Pro 4 replaced with a full Thunderbolt 3 port, that'll be the compelling device to replace my Surface Pro 2...perhaps with added improvements in the pen and camera departments (the creators update is making the use of cameras on a Tablet a lot more practical). 0 7 hours ago Reply Mister Burns Why do you say the creators update if making the use of games on a tablet a lot more practical? -1 1 hour ago Reply livejazz My Dell 5179's power connection is a type c connection, but it is a proprietary connection and will not accept any type c connector other than the one sold by Dell.

And for the ports, Type-C ports are the future for now. The current magnetic power connector is a huge port! Get rid of it and make the device slimmer and lighter or throw more stuff in it like more batteries for example.

The main index of the Taiwan Stock Exchange opened down 2.82 points at 9,946.66 and moved down further as sales climbed following a 1.41 percent uptick the previous session, when the market ended the day at a high of 9,949.48, on turnover of NT$124.076 billion, the dealers said. The main index closed down 51.68 points, or 0.52 percent, at 9,897.80, after hitting the day's low of 9,879.85 on turnover of NT$89.66 billion (US$2.94 billion). The main board was largely dragged down by large-cap stocks led by Largan Precision Co. (大立光), which supplies smartphone camera lenses to Apple, and other companies tied to Apple's supply chain, as well as optical shares. Largan Precision shares lost 4.56 percent to close at NT$4,600.00 per share, while contract chip maker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (台積電), the most heavily weighted stock on Taiwan's market, fell 0.78 percent to end at NT$191.50. The paper industry outperformed the broader market, closing 0.8 percent higher. Long Chen Paper Co. (榮成) rose 3.88 percent to end at NT$26.75, with 10 million shares traded, making it the biggest contributor to the sector's rise, the dealers said. Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) were net sellers, selling a net NT$77 million-worth of local shares after they bought a net NT$11.891 billion-worth of shares the previous session. FIIs remained net buyers of NT$25.098 billion-worth of local shares last week. Boryi Chien (簡伯儀), a manager at Cathay Securities Co. (國泰證券), said that despite the pullback, there is still a chance for the main board to test the 10,000-point mark in the near future. However, Chien suggested that the exchange rate of the Taiwan dollar could be a major factor affecting the market's future performance.

There is a lot of excitement for this model as it is the tenth-anniversary edition of the iconic smartphone. Lately, we have come across rumors that this new iPhone that is all set to be launched later this year could be delayed until October. The reason for this delay is likely the use of the OLED display panel on board that is expected to face some supply issues. In the meantime, the gossips regarding the phone don't seem to stop. There is a recent report that the iPhone 8 might cost over $1,000 for the high-end model. Also Read: iPhone 8 will be similar to Samsung Galaxy S8 Today, we have come up with a set of drawings of the alleged iPhone 8/X that has leaked online. These drawings show us how the smartphone might actually look like. Stay tuned to GizBot for more updates! Full wraparound display could be true Previously, we have come across rumors suggesting that the iPhone 8/X might feature a full wraparound display. The drawings those were leaked by Foxconn, the major manufacturer of Apple also point at the same. By saying wraparound display, we mean that there won't be any bezels and the home button, front camera, fingerprint sensor and other such sensors will be embedded on below the screen. The display will be wrapped using a rounded metal frame as in the Apple Watch. Vertical dual camera setup One of the leaked drawings of the alleged iPhone 8 or iPhone X comes in as a big surprise. The drawing shows a dual rear camera system at the rear in a vertical arrangement. If this drawing is anything to go by, the upcoming iPhone might have a vertical dual rear camera setup with LED flash and laser auto focus positioned between the two lines. Sides will be the same While it is said that there won't be any button or sensor at the front, the last drawing shows that the iPhone will still have the physical buttons and switches at the sides. These might include the volume rocker, power button, and mute/unmute switch. Stay tuned to GizBot for more updates!

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Monday, 10 April 2017 | MYT 7:00 AM Facebook launches digital assistant M in US M uses artificial intelligence and suggests relevant actions to help manage conversations or help get things done. — AFP Relaxnews Facebook launched its digital assistant named "M" for US users of its Messenger application, ramping up the social network's efforts in artificial intelligence. For users of the messaging platform, M will pop up and suggest "helpful actions" in the chat window. The move is seen as the first step in a broader launch of the digital assistant to compete against services from Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple and Samsung, which is launching its new assistant with its newest smartphone. M uses artificial intelligence and "suggests relevant actions to help manage conversations or help get things done," Facebook product managers Laurent Landowski and Kemal El Moujahid said in a blog post. "We are bringing the power of M's AI technology to support and enhance the Messenger experience and make it more useful, personal and seamless." With M, Facebook Messenger users can simplify tasks such as sending money to friends, sharing location or obtaining a ride-share. Facebook, which has its own artificial intelligence research lab, announced M in 2015 as an experiment, and the expansion to Messenger is another step in the social network's broader AI goals. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has spoken about – and created for his own home – a personal digital assistant named Jarvis to help him manage his household tasks and play with his family. Samsung is launching its assistant Bixby with its Galaxy S8 smartphones to help the South Korean giant break into a surging market for voice-activated virtual assistants, which includes Apple's Siri, Amazon's Alexa, Google's Assistant and Microsoft's Cortana. —  AFP Relaxnews Related Stories You May Be Interested Report: New tourism tax could hurt hotel operators Global chip boom brightens outlook for sector KL has a long way to go Of tinkerers, innovators and creators Over 1,000 trees along DASH highway to be felled Where to find a cuddly quokka for your selfie Others Also Read Pregnant wife challenges husband's detention under Poca Cagliari's Han first North Korean to score in Serie A Eco-friendly mattress for sound sleep advertisement Latest News Uber says its self-driving technology differs from Waymo’s British lender Wonga warns customers of personal data hack US net neutrality advocates blast Ajit Pai effort to reverse rules Twitter CEO forgoes compensation; long-time board member to leave Laptop ban spurred by terror concern raises warning of fire risk Most Viewed in Tech How strong is your password?

News sign-up Samsung is named India's most trusted brand News, 10 April 2017 Topics Brand equity & strength MUMBAI: Samsung, the South Korean consumer electronics giant, is the brand that Indian consumers trust the most, according to a listing of 1,000 brands in the country. The company climbed 17 places since last year, replacing its subsidiary Samsung Mobile, which plunged in the rankings following bad publicity about incidents of its Galaxy Note 7 catching fire. Two other consumer electronics multinationals, Sony and LG, retained their places as the second and third most trusted brands in India. Meanwhile, Apple climbed 12 ranks to come fourth and Tata Group took fifth, making it the only Indian company to occupy the top ten. That is according to brand analytics firm TRA Research, which questioned more than 2,500 consumers across 16 Indian cities to compile its Brand Trust Report 2017. Now in its seventh year, the report ranked automakers Honda and Maruti Suzuki in sixth and seventh place respectively, while US technology firm Dell came eighth. Lenovo, the Chinese technology giant, climbed 18 places to come ninth, while Indian scooter maker Bajaj rounded out the top ten. In terms of the highest-scoring categories, Forbes India reported that food and beverages came top with 161 brands included in the rankings, followed by FMCG (128 brands) and then automobiles (73 brands). "Samsung's 17-rank leap to top position and the 12-rank climb of Apple to fourth rank over last year are significant," said N Chandramouli, Chief Executive of TRA Research. "Of the 2016 list, four brands slipped out of the top 10 of 2017, namely Samsung Mobiles, Nokia, Godrej, and ICICI Bank. Also, it is more and more noticeable that NCR is steadily becoming the brand capital of India, with several leading brands located out of here." That was a reference to the National Capital Region, which includes New Delhi, the home of many of India's most trusted brands, including Baba Ramdev's Patanjali Ayurved, the fastest growing FMCG firm in the country.

Are you periodically forced to buy a new laptop because the technology – hardware or software – in your current laptop is no longer supported even though it’s fully functional? Workers processing electronic waste in Shantou City, Guangdong Province, China. Entry of new technologies into the market contribute to massive e-waste across the world. Photo - EPA The Microsoft Windows operating system is estimated to power about 90% of world’s personal computers today. Newer versions of Windows appear every couple of years or so. Once that happens, many applications, such as your favourite web browser, rush to support the new version. Over a few years, these applications move away from supporting older versions to the same extent as the new one. Google Chrome is a case in point. When it’s running on Windows Vista (a much older Windows operating system) on my laptop, it no longer receives updates from Google — that support has been removed. Microsoft has itself stopped support for Windows Vista. Another example: I have found it very difficult to find an external hard drive – the device you use to back up your data, photographs of family and friends and songs – that works with my fully functional eight-year-old Windows Vista-based laptop. Almost all easily available external hard disks now support some of the more recent versions of Windows. So, how can consumers like me get the required hard disk? The answer is that they probably can’t. Product lifespan Companies design products with an expected lifespan, and they plan technical support and product warranty accordingly. A good rule of thumb to estimate a product’s lifetime is to look at its warranty period, as it can help you guess how often its manufacturer would be launching new products. Apple provides a one-year limited warranty and launches a new iPhone almost every year. After the initial warranty period, you need to purchase an additional warranty for extended coverage. The warranty period is clearly not the actual expected lifetime of a product. But it does mean that if you don’t care for your device, you will be paying extra money for additional coverage in the best case scenario, or buying a new and more expensive device in the worst. After a few years, even your caring attitude will inevitably reach a point of diminishing returns because no matter how functional the hardware is, the software technology driving it evolves much faster. Reduced choice New products are seen as new choices but, unless you have the financial means, you actually have fewer choices. Using your older device constrains you because of the limited support for its hardware and software. And what happens when your old device runs into issues, even if they are minor ones? Since there’s no more support available for the hardware or the software, your options are to upgrade, or look for people with the skills to repair it. An upgrade can be expensive and the people with the necessary skills may simply not exist. Technical repair skills have sadly been on the decline. This is not just the case in the consumer electronics industry, where the US Bureau of Labour Statistics predicts a decline of 2 percent from 2014 to 2024 for electrical and electronics engineering technician jobs, but also in the automobile and other industries. This is a trend seen across in advanced economies. Effect on purchasing power It’s one thing to have purchasing power limited by financial means and another entirely to have it curtailed because of reduced choices. While companies may claim that user expectations change market dynamics, it’s also true that many companies make tireless efforts through advertisements and promotions to influence user expectations. Some actually try to set user expectations. The latter is typified in the idea that “customers don’t know what they want”, which is eschewed by many because of Steve Jobs. The goal of this idea is essentially to manoeuvre customers to satisfy a company’s goals. When a large customer base moves towards a particular set of products, a company need not continue offering support for pre-existing products. Many people may not need the new product, but they sell in the name of technological ‘evolution’ even when this evolution is nothing more than feature enhancement. Contribution to e-waste In countries where a service provider also sells consumer devices on contract, reduced choices may not be apparent. Take for example, smart phones such as Apple’s iPhone, which are sold by mobile carriers. With the launch of every a new iPhone, customers may have the option to upgrade to the latest device at a cost. Many see this as an opportunity to get a new device every few years. Some of the devices discarded as a result may find their way through vendor buyback programs, others may be recycled or refurbished versions in certain markets – but mostly without any warranty. Many others still, though, find their way to a landfill and thus contribute to electronic waste. Even if we give consumers the choice to not contribute to e-waste or delay it as much as possible, will they be likely to exercise it? Probably not, given the rate of technological evolution. Devices discarded because of a lack of technical support (like my laptop) are likely to find their way to landfills. A lot of the technological evolution in consumer electronics market today is not trying to solve a pressing need. Rather, it’s trying to fulfil desires, not all of which are innately human. And, in the process, it is reducing the choices we have. The author is a Research Scientist in Computer Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University.

Roadshow Originals 2017 Volkswagen Tiguan: Five things you need to know Is it updated or outdated? Here are five things you need to know about the newish 2017 Volkswagen Tiguan. 1:10 / April 7, 2017 Transcript We hit the road in the 2017 Volkswagen Tiguan and here are five things you need to know. Nope this is not the newest Tiguan. VW debuted a newer, larger Tiguan earlier this year but then confused everyone when it announced that this now ten year old first generation model would continue to be sold along side it for a while longer The base model is actually pretty good. With Android Auto, Apple Car Play, and Mirror Link as standard, you're just a smart phone and a USB cable away from really great navigation, audio streaming, and tech. No options necessary. The engine is pretty great. The 2.0-Liter turbocharged four banger is the best part of driving the Tiguan with it's peppy 200 horsepower and 207 pound feet of torque. But fuel economy is not so great. [INAUDIBLE] makes a heck of a first impression but low 22 miles per gallon efficiency and a thirst for premium fuel proves to be a pretty sour Achilles Heal. Options, what options? The gen one Tiguan really starts to show its age when you look for advanced driver aided safety features and find a little more than a standard back up camera. That's so 2008. And that's five things you need to know about the 2017 Volkswagen Tiguan. Check out the full review for a more complete picture. [MUSIC].

Figures published by Visa on Monday show that household expenditure increased by 1 per cent in March on the same month last year – a fall from 1.3 per cent in February – which takes the average annual growth rate for the quarter to 0.9 per cent from growth of 2.7 per cent in the final quarter of 2016. “Our data suggests that consumer spending is beginning to slow from the strong levels seen in late 2016, as rising prices increasingly squeeze household purchasing power,” said Kevin Jenkins, Visa’s managing director for the UK and Ireland.

The leisure and hospitality sectors saw growth of 7.2 per cent and 4 per cent respectively, which Mr Jenkins said “confirms an ongoing trend of consumers prioritising experiences”. Spending in the food, beverages and tobacco sector declined by 0.4 per cent, while clothing and footwear and household goods fell by 0.2 per cent. The biggest fall was in the transport and communication sector where sales fell by 2.2 per cent. The Visa figures also chime with data from accounting firm BDO published last week, which showed that UK high street sales failed to grow for a fourth straight month in March.

Mr Jenkins said that Visa’s data also shows “consumers increasingly favouring ‘clicks’ over bricks and mortar shops”.

Retail footfall analyst Springboard is predicting that the Easter weekend will bring a 5.4 per cent increase to UK retail footfall and an 8.8 per cent footfall increase to UK high streets. UK retail footfall increased by 1.2 per cent in March year-on-year, breaking a six-month decline, even though spending was hit by rising inflation and general economic uncertainty. Read more Retail sales beat expectations in February Diane Wehrle, a director at Springboard, said the forecast for Easter was due in part to the mild spring weather and the timing of payday for many employees. “Last year Easter took place on 25 March, a few days in advance of payday for many shoppers,” she said. “This combined with poor weather conditions to reduce footfall across retail destinations from Easter Saturday onwards.” Footfall dropped by 1.9 per cent overall year-on-year in 2016.

She said that on Good Friday last year – the one day of the weekend with good weather – footfall on high streets increased by 16.4 per cent compared to Good Friday 2015. But Ms Wehrle also noted that an increase in footfall is unlikely to translate into a spending boost this year, and that shoppers are increasingly likely to spend on food, beverages and experiences than fashion as inflation starts to bite.

Previously available to Pixel phones, Google Assistant lets users talk to his phone in a conversational way, providing answers to questions about weather, flight information and appointments. Yes, it’s like Apple’s Siri. LG was one of the first smartphone makers to reveal it would feature the assistant on its new device, the G6. In its blog post, the assistant will be rolled out this week in the US, while users in Canada, Australia, Germany and the UK will get the feature soon as well. “With this update, hundreds of millions of Android users will now be able to try out the Google Assistant,” Gummi Hafsteinsson, product lead for Google Assistant, said. To use this (if you have Nougat or Marshmallow operating system), just long press the Home button and say “Ok Google” to get started. And now, you can ask things such as ‘What’s my confirmation number for my London flight,’ ‘Take me to Museu Picasso,’ ‘Do I need an umbrella today,’ and many more. According to its blog, there is no need to download the update because Google Assistant will be usable on phones running Nougat and Marshmallow with Google Play Services. “Our goal is to make the Assistant available anywhere you need it. It came to Android Wear 2.0 – via new smartwatches – just a few weeks ago and, as we previewed in January, the Assistant is also coming to TVs and cars,” Hafsteinsson said.   Facebook Comments Website Comments free pron March 6th, 2017 Reply ab5Pn3 My brother suggested I might like this website.

(Honda) (Los Angeles Times/TNS) - The science experiment is over. Hydrogen fuel cars are real. Toyota and Hyundai proved it with their Mirai and Tucson FCVs, respectively. Now, Honda has taken the technology a step further. The 2017 Clarity is real, and it’s really fun. Honda’s fuel-cell entry is a stylish four-door sedan that offers premium cabin comfort and cargo capacity for five passengers and their gear. This is possible because Honda engineers downsized and repositioned the engine components so they fit under the hood, like on a standard internal combustion engine car — instead of taking up space between the rear seats, or in the trunk area, as they do on other fuel-cell vehicles. With the engine under the hood, Honda could park the battery under the front seats and two hydrogen tanks under and just behind the rear seats. The remaining real estate is all devoted to human space. Like its fuel-cell competitors, Honda’s Clarity is powered by a fuel stack that combines on-board compressed hydrogen with oxygen to produce electricity, which then drives an electric motor that propels the car, leaving only water vapor to emit from the tail pipe. But Honda has taken its Clarity a step beyond the Mirai and Tucson by giving it a Sport driving mode that takes great advantage of the electric motor. In normal mode, the Clarity is a slow, steady, sedate sedan. But in Sport mode, which emphasizes fun over fuel economy, it’s an energized, engaged driving experience. Over two days of driving — on city streets, wide-open freeways and curving canyons — I was surprisingly entertained by the Clarity’s punchy acceleration and precise handling. The Clarity has some luxury and high-tech appointments. The keyless ignition unlocks the vehicle at the touch of the driver’s hand. Rain-sensing wipers engage with the arrival of precipitation. A heads-up display projects vital information onto the windshield. The ultra-suede and simulated wood grain interior and the dash elements all have a quality fit and finish. (Honda) The Clarity is connected and ready for Apple Car Play and Android Auto. The HondaLink cellphone app will allow the operator to start the car remotely and get the heater or AC going. It will also find the car, electronically, if the operator parked it while confused by shopping-mall euphoria; it can also find the closest fueling station and provide directions for getting there. It’s an easy car to drive and, once you get used to the absence of engine sound and vibration, feels like any other mid-range sedan. The adequate visibility is enhanced by a navigation screen that turns into a rear-view camera not just when the car is in reverse but when the right-turn indicator is engaged — giving the driver added visual assistance when backing up or making a right-hand lane change. Silent, smooth and responsive, the Clarity got my high marks for performance. I even forgave it for the unappealing exterior design, which seems to suffer from the syndrome that struck the first generation of Porsche Panameras — with the sleek lines extending from the sporty front of the car having to expand to allow for a full-size rear seating area. Like its rivals, the Clarity’s hydrogen tank can be filled in three to five minutes, from a fueling device that looks and acts a lot like a traditional gas station pump. Range between refills on the Clarity is 366 miles per tank, according to the Environmental Protection Agency — ahead of the Mirai’s range of 312 miles and the Tucson’s 265. However, also like all hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles, the Clarity’s fast-fueling capacity is limited by the current fuel-cell infrastructure. As of March 2017, there were only 26 fueling stations open in California — which has by far the densest fuel-cell penetration. Those numbers are expected to rise, Honda executives and others say. Stephen Ellis, manager of fuel-cell-vehicle marketing for Honda, said an additional 36 stations will be on line, split between Northern and Southern California, by 2018. Some drivers may experience other range issues. Although Honda is proud of its best-in-class 366 miles of EPA-approved total driving distance, my experience with the Clarity suggested otherwise. So did the experiences of other automotive journalists who shared their reactions to the Clarity with me. The EPA numbers are based on a calculation of miles driven per kilogram, and then translated to a miles-per-gallon equivalent and multiplied by the size of the fuel tank. The federal agency’s testers gave the Clarity a 68 mpg-equivalent rating. I got less than that, probably as a result of the Fleming Leadfoot Factor. I was driving the car mostly in Sport mode, and taking advantage of the peppy performance. According to the dashboard display, I was going to get well under 366 miles per tank, maybe 100 miles less than that. Other reviewers had similar experiences. Two told me their test drives seemed to produce something between 240 and 260 miles per tank of fuel. One refilled his tank when it was half full, having gone about 120 miles. Another drove about 280 miles before refilling, while being told by the car that the remaining range was less than 10 miles. Ellis, asked about the discrepancy, said the displayed range on the car was “weighted heavily on the vehicle’s lifetime fuel economy.” Drivers who’d borrowed the Clarity before me drove like I did, in other words. The onboard computer adjusted, and predicted a total range of 254 miles when I got into the car with a full tank, based on the way the car had been driven by previous drivers. Had it been a brand new car, driven EPA-style in Normal mode, Ellis said, the Clarity would likely have predicted a total range of closer to the EPA-approved 366 miles, and then delivered that range. Could I have achieved something close to that, despite the car’s history, had I driven that way? Could someone else? “Absolutely,” Ellis said. Hydrogen fuel-cell-vehicle sales, limited by technology that’s new to most consumers and by the shortage of dealers that sell the cars and fueling stations that fill them, have not been robust. Toyota said it had moved 1,245 four-seater Mirai fuel-cell cars as of the end of February, almost all of them leased. Honda isn’t selling its Claritys at all, for the time being, and only offers the cars in California, but with a very appealing lease deal. Wannabe lease holders will pay $369 a month, after a down payment of $2,868, to drive one home. That’s a little more than the $349 a month and $2,499 down for a Mirai, and a little less than the $499 a month and $2,999 down for a Tucson. Any of the three will qualify for a $5,000 cash rebate, and Honda will throw in a $15,000 fuel credit, via a credit card — which the company said should be enough to cover the full three years of the average lease. (Toyota and Hyundai will cover the fueling costs on the Mirai and Tucson.) That’s a good thing because compressed hydrogen, when calculated on a per-gallon rate, costs three to five times more than gasoline, the equivalent of $9.99 per gallon at some locations, more than $15 at others (though hydrogen-technology boosters insist that, with more widespread adoption, fuel costs will come down). The vehicles also qualify for the coveted California HOV carpool lane sticker, which alternative-fuel analysts still see as a key driver of fuel-cell and battery electric vehicle adoption. For expeditions that would take the Clarity beyond its 366-mile refuel range, Honda also offers 21 days of free Avis luxury-car rental over the duration of the lease. There are many people eager to get their hands on the new cars, with some dealers holding waiting lists with “hundreds” of names, Ellis said. “We’ve tried to eliminate all the barriers and hurdles,” he said. Honda executives have said they were trying, with the Clarity, to build a fuel-cell car that offered zero emissions, a long driving range and a comfortable “lounge-like” interior for five full-sized adults. By those standards, Honda has succeeded. The Clarity isn’t a science experiment anymore. It’s a car, and a good one. For those not ready for hydrogen, Honda will start offering other Clarity models soon. One will be a late 2017 battery-powered electric, the other a 2018 plug-in hybrid. They’ll look and act a lot more like other low-emission vehicles currently on the road. But they won’t come with free fuel.

The gains by the former were brought on by the consistent efforts it had made to modernise itself in the last three to four years, while Emirates was impacted by the uncertain operating climate for regional airlines, according to the UK-based Brand Finance, which comes up with the annual rankings. Emirates had been the most valuable brand in the Middle East since Brand Finance initiated the rankings in 2010. (But it remains the most “powerful brand” in the region given its investments in marketing and how this plays out on profitability and revenues. In contrast, brand value is tuned on more intangible factors such as perceptions about its products and services.) In the Middle East, the Top 10 rankings were dominated by etisalat at number three (at $5.51 billion), Qatar National Bank (placed fourth with $3.82 billion) and Emirates NBD (with $3.4 billion for a fifth place). The others were the Qatari telco Ooredoo, Saudi Arabia’s dairy giant Al Marai, Abu Dhabi’s National Bank of Abu Dhabi, another telco is Zain of Kuwait, and Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank. Moreover, UAE-based brands retain the highest share — at 44 per cent — as a percentage of brand value among the Middle East’s Top 50 brands. Saudi Arabia comes next with 32 per cent. Tech/media brands At the global level, Google pipped Apple to the top spot, “brought on more a by relatively lacklustre performance by Apple in the early part of last year and which told on its branding,” said Andrew Campbell, Managing Director of Brand Finance M.E. (The rest of the top 10 global listing was dominated by tech/media brands, with only Wal-Mart and a Chinese banking major ICBC.) “Emirates and Qatar Airways were primarily impacted by external factors such as the strong dollar and by the economic outlook for the region,” said Campbell. (Qatar Airways saw its brand value slide 38 per cent to $2.16 billion, in turn losing its status as Qatar’s most valuable brand to QNB.) As for STC, “it is re-engaging its many stakeholders with a fresh, personable outlook. A clear indication of its success is the five-point increase in its brand strength index score, proving that putting some heart into it pays off.” In fact, the presence of so many telcos in the region’s top brand valuations shouldn’t be a surprise. These brands and the services they offer on multiple platforms make them near universal. And with the sort of smartphone penetration this part of the world has, telcos have managed to offer up a certain level of consumer experience and backed it up with marketing dollars. Banking The other category that rules the Middle East brand perceptions is banking — “Apart from investing more in brand marketing, there is the drive towards a digital online future and that’s a strength,” Campbell said. Banking makes up the biggest share of total brand value of the “Brand Finance Middle East’s 50”, comprising 43 per cent of the $75 billion total. Banking is also the source of the region’s fastest growing brand — Dubai Islamic Bank, up 136 per cent last year. According to Brand Finance’s head banking analyst, Alex Corringham: “The increase in brand performance of so many of the Middle East’s bank brands has come about as a result of more favourable economic conditions, international expansion and an increased need for branded products and services within these markets. Over the past few years many have replaced their older, more localised brand names and logos for those that resonate with consumers and can be recognised on an international level.” More from Companies Saudi Telecom edges past Emirates in brand value 12:00 am More annual shareholder meetings go virtual Secretary Ross’ former firm tied to China steel tags from this storyAPPLE follow this tag on MGNDubai follow this tag on MGNSaudi Arabia follow this tag on MGNQatar follow this tag on MGNQatar Airways follow this tag on MGNKuwait follow this tag on MGNGoogle follow this tag on MGN filed underGulfNewsBusinessCompanies tagsAPPLE follow this tag on MGN+ MGNDubai follow this tag on MGN+ MGNSaudi Arabia follow this tag on MGN+ MGNQatar follow this tag on MGN+ MGNQatar Airways follow this tag on MGN+ MGN Also In CompaniesMore annual shareholder meetings go virtual Business Gallery Pictures: Gitex Shopper Spring 2017 Manufacturing is order of the day Business Videos PlayAbu Dhabi Ship Building enjoys growing success Strata UAE leads aerospace manufacturing FOLLOW US Most Popular ViewedCommentedVideosPictures 01Saudi Telecom edges past Emirates in brand value 02Secretary Ross’ former firm tied to China steel 03Hamdan attends Forever Living investors meeting Play Abu Dhabi Ship Building enjoys growing success Nov 24, 2016 Play Strata UAE leads aerospace manufacturing Oct 25, 2016 Play Emirates opens SkyPharma in Dubai Sep 18, 2016 Play Emirates Group announces record profits May 10, 2016 8Images Massive development at Abu Dhabi airport Mar 11, 2017 11Images Pink diamond worth millions shown in London Mar 21, 2017 1Image Pictures: Nokia 3310 comes back to life at MWC Feb 27, 2017 36Images Robots, apps and 3D printing at Gitex Oct 22, 2015 Currency Converter first-currency currencyAEDDinarRupee= first-currency currencyINRDinarRupee World, UAE Markets Data OverviewGccEuropeAsiau.s.

My bag contains [my] make up kit, hand lotion and hand sanitizer aside from my other personal belongings like wallet and phone. Nothing beats clean hands! I guess a bag must basically contain things that are useful for our daily activities.  What electronic gadgets are you currently using? For my laptop I am using a Macbook and an iPhone for my phone. It’s a fact that Apple products have always have the good quality and more advanced.  What’s inside your closet? Mostly my dresses from different collections are the major stuff inside my closet. I like glamour office attires, which I can also wear for evening events. I am also into shoes and handbags which occupy the most space in my closet. What is your style of clothing? Talking about my style cannot be defined in one corner. We have to be flexible. For me, it depends on the weather and occasion. Living in Dubai you can see me with fit clothes during summer and you can see me with fur during winter and sportswear every morning as I hit the gym or if I am just at home spending my time painting and  when I am with my music,  I  just merely wear my rugged clothes. What clothing brands do you think closely fit your sense of fashion?  I don’t really have a clothing brand in particular, when I shop, I visit every store and find something that fits my body type. My principle is this: If it looks good on you, buy it! No matter what brand it is, as I shop depending on what makes me look good not just the hype.  That would help you boost confidence.  What is your favorite perfume?  Chloé Eu du Parfum, it has a fresh powdery floral scent which makes me feel happy and boost my self-esteem and femininity. What is your favorite brand of shoes?  I both like Louboutin and Valentino.  I invest in a pair of good quality shoes as those brands produce comfortable shoes, more durable and they last longer especially [since] I always love to wear heels so I need to have a good quality pair of shoes. Are you a shopaholic?  Yes, I was before to be honest, but when I started earning from my own sweat, I intended not to, but I treat myself once in a while. We all have to admit that buying something new (new car, new dress, new shoes, new bags) makes us feel great but it’s only passive. For as long as you are not spending beyond your budget, then that’s totally fine!  What inspires or influences you to buy an item? I normally buy stuff for my basic needs or replacing old items but if I see great deals on the stores, I don’t want to miss the opportunity!              What brands do you trust for your skin care? I use SK-II and Shiseido for my face. I am very careful when buying products for my skin especially since I have acne prone skin. That’s why these two brands stand out for me. I also use Nivea shower gel and Nivea Lotion ever since. What is a Branded Pinoy for you? Branded Pinoy for me is someone who has a positive outlook in life. Our brains are wired to find things we are looking for. If you are always cynical or waiting for things to go wrong, then your life will reflect that. On the other hand, having a positive outlook in life will bring you joy and provide you with inspiration when you least expect it.  Facebook Comments Website Comments free pron March 6th, 2017 Reply HL5bYg Pretty!
