(NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone SE is not selling well in the massive smartphone market that is India. STORY Chris Neiger's story for the Motley Fool tipped us off to this new data. Here's what's happening. First, while smartphone sales growth is slowing in many of the mature markets like the United States and China, it is booming gin India. Here is a chart of the forecasts for Indian smartphone growth: That's 204 million smartphone users in India in 2016. By 2017, India will be larger than the United States. Apple Inc., however, has a tiny footprint in the market due to a bevy of reasons from high prices to very low local brand awareness. All of that seemed to change for the better after a deal was struck between the iPhone maker and India's government which allowed Apple to side-step the 30% local sourcing rules by way of a new rule for "cutting-edge technology." It was all very neatly orchestrated, how Apple Inc. and India danced together to get the iPhone maker into the country and it has worked out well for India. Apple will be building a R&D center there and opening Apple stores. This was all great news for both parties. But, IDC has released data that is not really what Apple Inc. had in mind. "Apple's iPhone SE failed to make any significant impact in the premium segment while its previous generation iPhone 5S continued to contribute majority volume." Source: Jaipal Singh , Market Analyst, Client Devices, IDC India The iPhone SE is Apple's newest iPhone that went back to the smaller screen but with vastly upgraded technology inside the phone. The iPhone SE sold very well last quarter and was in fact the primary driver for Apple's numbers coming in above consensus estimates. But the aspirations for the iPhone SE go much further. The average middle class shopper in India doesn't have the same level of wealth as a consumer from the United States or China. Apple's phones are extremely expensive in India, where the average phone sells for about $150 per IDC. While the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6S are far more expensive, the iPhone SE cuts the price by about $150. Still, even at the lower price point for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), it comes in at about $580 for the Indian consumer. Still very, very expensive. Without strong brand recognition in India, consumers simply are unwilling to pay up for the iPhone SE, but rather have chosen to go with the iPhone 5Sm which is the same size but less expensive and with less powerful hardware. IS APPLE FAILING IN INDIA? A gut reaction to this data could be the disastrous kind -- that Apple is failing in India. Apple is not failing in India. Apple's market share in tier-I Indian cities jumped to 5.8% in calendar Q4 of 2015, up from 1%. but, the iPhone SE is a serious concern and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has to do something. Apple Inc. will be opening up its first Apple stores in India soon, and those stores have a gem for Apple everywhere else in the world. That's a start. The elephant in the room, of course, is Apple's average selling price. The company has held tight to its margins on the iPhone, almost like a battle cry. But, as Chris Neiger shrewdly points out, perhaps it's time for Apple to change its mode of operation -- at least for India. We believe the Apple brand will see an upswing in recognition when the Apple inc. stores open and do believe the iPhone SE will be a success at some level in India. The phrase "failed to make any significant impact" will not be the end game -- it's the starting point and it was expected. We also add that the $25 million technology center Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) opened in May of this year, which will create 4,000 jobs, will have a direct impact on the company's brand recognition and that means, the iPhone's recognition. The author is long shares of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). WHY THIS MATTERS There's so much going on with Apple, that it's nearly impossible to keep up with.

Apple is reportedly working on a significant redesign of the iPhone for the 2017 model that will not include a home button, reports Bloomberg. This will allow Apple to focus more on the display, which is said to have a curved design similar to that of Samsung’s newer smartphones, according to Nikkei Asian Review. Blog Apple Insider also reported last year that Apple is working on an iPhone without a home button. Removing the home button would be a crucial move for Apple, considering it has functioned as the portal to technologies like TouchID, Apple Pay, and Siri. Still, many modern Android phones have axed the physical home button to allow for larger screens. These phones instead have navigational keys baked into their software or touch-sensitive sensors that sit on the bezel. Next year’s model is expected to represent a major redesign of the iPhone, while this year’s version is said to be more of an incremental update. Apple has released its iPhones on a tick-tock pattern in recent years, and this year’s iPhone 7 launch is expected to be the first departure from that schedule, according to The Wall Street Journal. Every other year, Apple typically introduces a major overhaul of the iPhone, while the models in between iterate on the iPhone’s current form factor. The iPhone 6, for instance, represented a complete redesign of the iPhone compared to the 5 and 5s models, while the iPhone 6s kept that same design but added some new features, like 3D Touch. The overhaul reportedly coming in 2017 will mark 10 years since the original iPhone launched in 2007. Apple declined TIME’s request for comment.

Home Latest News World Politics Business Technology Arts & Culture Health Videos Blogs Apple Fixes Security Flaw After UAE Dissident’s iPhone Targeted AAA January 3, 2017 Subscribe Home Latest News World Politics Business Technology Arts & Culture Health Videos Blogs Apple Fixes Security Flaw After UAE Dissident’s iPhone Targeted Reuters August 28, 2016, 4 months ago NewsTechnology 0 Apple Inc issued a patch on Thursday to fix a dangerous security flaw in iPhones and iPads after researchers discovered that a prominent United Arab Emirates dissident's phone had been targeted with a previously unknown method of hacking By Joseph Menn SAN FRANCISCO, Aug 28 – Apple Inc issued a patch on Thursday to fix a dangerous security flaw in iPhones and iPads after researchers discovered that a prominent United Arab Emirates dissident’s phone had been targeted with a previously unknown method of hacking. The thwarted attack on the human rights activist, Ahmed Mansoor, used a text message that invited him to click on a web link. Instead of clicking, he forwarded the message to researchers at the University of Toronto’s Citizen Lab. The hack is the first known case of software that can remotely take over a fully up-to-date iPhone 6. Experts at Citizen Lab worked with security company Lookout and determined that the link would have installed a program taking advantage of a three flaws that Apple and others were not aware of. The researchers disclosed their findings on Thursday. “Once infected, Mansoor’s phone would have become a digital spy in his pocket, capable of employing his iPhone’s camera and microphone to snoop on activity in the vicinity of the device, recording his WhatsApp and Viber calls, logging messages sent in mobile chat apps, and tracking his movements,” Citizen Lab wrote in a report released on Thursday. The researchers said they had alerted Apple a week and a half ago, and the company developed a fix and distributed it as an automatic update to iPhone 6 owners. Apple spokesman Fred Sainz confirmed that the company had issued the patch after being contacted by researchers. The Citizen Lab team attributed the attack software to a private seller of monitoring systems, NSO Group, an Israeli company that makes software for governments which can secretly target mobile phones and gather information. Tools such as that used in this case, a remote exploit for a current iPhone, cost as much as $1 million. NSO Chief Executive Shalev Hulio referred questions to spokesman Zamir Dahbash, who said the company “cannot confirm the specific cases” covered in the Citizen Lab and Lookout reports. Dahbash said NSO sells within export laws to government agencies, which then operate the software. “The agreements signed with the company’s customers require that the company’s products only be used in a lawful manner,” he added. “Specifically, the products may only be used for the prevention and investigation of crimes.” Dahbash did not answer follow-up questions, including whether the exposure of the tools use against Mansoor in UAE and a Mexican journalist would end any sales to those countries. NSO has kept a low profile in the security world, despite its 2014 sale of a majority stake for $120 million to California private equity firm Francisco Partners. That company’s chief executive, Dipanjan Deb, did not return a call on Thursday. In November 2015, Reuters reported that NSO had begun calling itself “Q” and was looking for a buyer for close to $1 billion. Sarah McKune, senior legal adviser to Citizen Lab, said Israel tries to follow the strictures of the Wassenaar Arrangement, which puts controls on the international sale of nuclear and chemical weapons technology and more recently cyber intrusion tools. NSO may have had to apply for an export license, she added, saying that raised questions about “what consideration was given to the human rights record of UAE.” The Israeli embassy in Washington did not respond to an email seeking comment. NSO marketing material says that it also has capabilities for Android and BlackBerry devices. No version of the software has been exposed, indicating it remains effective. Citizen Lab did not directly accuse UAE of carrying out the attack on Mansoor with NSO gear called Pegasus, but it said other NSO attacks on critics of the regime were connected to the government. It also said a Mexican journalist and a minority party politician in Kenya had been targeted with NSO software and that domain names set up for other attacks referred to entities in Uzbekistan, Thailand, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and other nations, suggesting that other targets lived in those nations. A call to the UAE embassy in Washington was not immediately returned. The market for “lawful intercept,” or government hacking tools, has come under increased scrutiny with revelations about authoritarian customers and noncriminal victims. Two popular vendors, Hacking Team of Italy and Gamma Group of the United Kingdom, have had their wares exposed by researchers or hackers. Mansoor had previously been targeted with software from both of those companies, according to Citizen Lab. “I can’t think of a more compelling case of serial misuse of lawful intercept malware than the targeting of Mansoor,” said one of the Citizen Lab researchers, John Scott-Railton.

What is disturbing is that hackers who get hold of these information virtually give it for free. (Photo : Gavin Roberts/Tap Magazine via Getty Images) A selection of accessories for Apple iOS devices photographed during a studio shoot for Tap Magazine, November 13, 2012.   Tech giant Apple was also a victim of spyware. Apple took a fast step in defeating these spyware flaws by releasing a security update. Users can relax now as this update from Apple will not allow any of the Apple devices to be accessed by hackers. According to USAToday, the espionage software was discovered by Ahmed Mansoor, a prominent United Arab Emirates dissident, received a text message which invited him to click on a Web link on his iPhone 6. Ahmed Mansoor had been a victim in past and he cheated out the hackers by sending this link to University of Toronto's Citizen Lab. Researcher worked out with San Francisco based mobile security firm Lookout and found that a "sophisticated, targeted, and persistent mobile attack on iOS using three zero-day vulnerabilities we call 'Trident", which some have valued up to $1million. Andrew Blaich, a staff researcher at Lookout said "As security breaches go, this is fairly serious, considering how fast Apple addressed it" The spyware attack through the link will break into an iOS device and spy on information of the victim pertaining to Facebook, emails, calendars or any other important stuff in the device. Apple's extremely fast step in releasing security update helps the users to keep their device safe from spywares. Apple's support released the link on how to download the security update -support-apple. According to Fox News, Mansoor in an interview in downtown Ajman, United Arab Emirates said "It feels really good," and he added that developments "could save hundreds of people from being targets." The spyware texts were shown to the associated press in Ajman. Citizen Lab and Lookout released two reports stating that how a tap of finger on a web link would have made hackers access to Ahmed Mansoor's mobile data. It would have given the hacker's free reign to eavesdrop on calls, harvest messages, activate camera and drain the phone's trove of personal data. A strong step from Emirati dissident helped Apple to take rapid step to ensure the security of the Apple devices.     Share ( 0 ) Tweet ( 0 ) TAGSapple, iphone, hackers, spyware Copyright © 2016 News Everyday Related Articles Medical 'Marijuana' Has A New Form And This Time It Is Without The High, What We ...

According to reports from Lookout and Citizen Lab, these “issues” are three iOS zero-days used to spy on political dissidents all over the world. The two security company think that the zero-days are a part of the Pegasus software suite. The suite was created by the Israel-based firm, NSO Group, and then sold to governments around the world which used it against targets of interest. Even though Pegasus is referred to as a surveillance software developed for law enforcement agencies, it doesn’t differ from a spying software, available on the underground cyber marked and used by crooks for malicious purposes. NSO`s Pegasus has been around for many years now, but more popular and powerful rivals have always overshadowed it. For instance, the HackingTeam which developed and sells the RCS surveillance package or the Gamma Group and its FinFisher product. Apple released a fix yesterday to address Pegasus features that allowed it to spy on iOS users without them realizing. Powered by three zero-days, the features give crooks the opportunity to take over an iOS device by tricking users to load a malicious webpage. When the zero-day exploit code is executed on the targeted device, the hacker would be able to use the Pegasus software for gaining complete control over Apple devices. They could overhear conversations via the mic, see where the user is located, exfiltrate data, follow IM conversations, etc., Lookout says. “Pegasus is the most sophisticated attack we’ve seen on any endpoint because it takes advantage of how integrated mobile devices are in our lives and the combination of features only available on mobile.”– explains the Lookout team. Moreover, a deeper Pegasus analysis revealed a concerning discovery. Researchers have found traces of a kernel mapping table that has values that target previous iOS version, way back to iOS 7. This means that the spyware was active under the radar for years before finally being detected a month ago. One of Pegasus`s main victims was Ahmed Mansoor. Mansoor is a human rights activist from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and he was the one suspect something was wrong which led to the discovery of the three zero-days. Mansoor is considered to the one of the most spied on activists in the world. As he had been previously targeted by both RSC spyware and FinFisher, it didn’t take him long to recognize a phishing lure sent to him via SMS, promising new details about torture practices in the UAE. He immediately informed the Canadian investigative interdisciplinary laboratory, which specializes in political cyber-espionage, Citizen Lab. Citizen Lab included the Lookout company in the investigation to analyze the attack`s technical side. Lookout was the one to find the three zero-days and Citizen Lab managed to find the connection between them and the NSO Group`s Pegasus software. Citizen Lab found out Pegasus`s export licenses for several governments. Then, Pegasus was linked to other attacks, including the one against a Mexican journalist who uncovered corruption by Mexico’s President, and a couple of attacks in Kenya, whose targets are unknown. “While these spyware tools are developed in democracies, they continue to be sold to countries with notorious records of abusive targeting of human rights defenders.” – the Citizen Lab team says -“Such sales occur despite the existence of applicable export controls.” SHARE Facebook Twitter tweet Simona Atanasova http://virusguides.com Simona has graduated First language school - Varna, Bulgaria with a main focus on English philology.

EST August 27, 2016 Human rights activist Ahmed Mansoor shows a screenshot of a spoof text message he received in Ajman, United Arab Emirates. Mansoor was recently targeted by spyware that can hack into Apple's iPhone handset. AP photo CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST SAN FRANCISCO — Apple issued a security update to prevent attacks by rare, highly expensive spyware that exploits flaws in the mobile operating system for iPhones and iPads, after security researchers said it was used to target a Middle Eastern dissident's phone. In a statement to USA TODAY Thursday, Apple said it immediately fixed the vulnerability upon learning of it. It advises customers to download the latest version of its iOS, version 9.3.5, for security protection. The Associated Press first reported on the patch. The espionage software was discovered because it had been targeted at Ahmed Mansoor, a prominent United Arab Emirates dissident. Mansoor received a text message on his iPhone 6 that invited him to click on a web link. He had been the victim of spyware in the past and so forwarded the message to researchers at the University of Toronto's Citizen Lab. Researchers there worked with San Francisco-based mobile security firm Lookout. In a blog post Thursday on its website, Lookout researchers said they found a “sophisticated, targeted, and persistent mobile attack on iOS using three zero-day vulnerabilities we call ‘Trident.’” The flaw lets the hacker break into an iOS device and spy on information gleaned from the victims' apps such as Facebook, WhatsApp, FaceTime, Gmail and Calendar, the post said. "As security breaches go, this is fairly serious, considering how fast Apple addressed it," says Andrew Blaich, a staff researcher at Lookout. Citizen Lab traced the link to NSO Group, which it calls a “cyberwar” company in Israel that sells a spyware product called Pegasus, said John Scott-Railton, one of the Citizen Lab report's authors. NSO would not comment on whether it had sold the software. “NSO’s mission is to help make the world a safer place, by providing authorized governments with technology that helps them combat terror and crime,” said Zamir Dahbash, NSO spokesman, in a statement to USA TODAY. The company only sells its software to authorized governmental agencies and requires customers to sign an agreement that its products will only be used in a lawful manner, specifically “the prevention and investigation of crimes,” he said. NSO Group is reportedly owned by an American venture capital firm, Francisco Partners Management, according to Citizen Lab. A call to FPM was not immediately returned. COSTLY GEAR The cost of such sophisticated spyware is very high. A set of similar digital tools recently sold for $1 million, Citizen Lab's Scott-Railton and his co-author, Bill Marczak, wrote in an online report posted Thursday. The Internet watchdog group discovered the security hole a few weeks ago and immediately notified Apple, Lookout's Blaich said.

X Business week: crunch time for Apple, the EU and US A big results week, IFA rows with ABP, employment is up and car insurance swerves Sat, Aug 27, 2016, 08:00 Albert Manifold, chief executive at CRH: he said continued positive momentum in the Americas and some recovery in Europe would continue to boost performance. Photograph: Cyril Byrne / The Irish Times         All the signs are that the EU Commission will shortly issue its final decision on the tax arrangements between Ireland and Apple. This week, the row started to heat up. Everyone expects the European Commission to stick to its original decision that the deal involved illegal state aid to the American giant. But the question is what the commission says should be done about it, and particularly how much tax the Irish Government should recoup. On Wednesday, the US treasury come out fighting, taking the unusual step of issuing a “ white paper”, which was a strong attack on what the commission was doing. While it was not specifically about Apple – the European Commission is also investigating the tax affairs of a number of other US giants – no-one was in any doubt that this case is the “ big one”. The treasury said that the EU commission was acting beyond its powers as a “supra-national” tax authority. It went on to argue that, as US companies had no notice of this new approach, it was particularly unreasonable for the commission to tell countries to seek to recoup tax payments going back years. The commission’s approach, it added, threatened the whole multilateral approach to tax. Add in a warning about the potential “chilling” impact on transatlantic investment and a not very veiled threat to unspecified retaliation and you can see what is at stake here. The commission is expected to press ahead and make its decision. But how much will it say Ireland should collect from Apple? Either way, it looks very likely that this affair – already three years cooking – will now head to the European courts, meaning we will not get a final outcome for a few more years. COMPANY RESULTS In a big week for company results, CRH was in focus, promising a return to dividend growth for the first time in seven years and signalling that full-year earnings will top €3 billion. The company lifted its interim dividend by 1.6 per cent to 18.6 cents, after reporting figures slightly ahead of market expectations. Chief executive Albert Manifold said continued positive momentum in the Americas and some recovery in Europe would continue to boost performance. ADVERTISEMENT CRH spent a massive €6.5 billion buying assets hived off after the merger of Lafarge and Holcim, but such is its earnings growth that the market remains confident that the extra debt taken on to fund this will quickly reduce. And now, in the relentless drive to growth, Manifold is signalling more acquisitions on the radar, with the possibility of spending €1.5 billion to €2 billion in the year ahead. Irish property prices to increase by at least 8% in 2017 European shares lifted by positive manufacturing data Michael ‘Kell’ Ryan, brother of Ryanair founder, dies in England Meanwhile, merger costs left Paddy Power Betfair with a £47.5 million (€55.4 million) loss at the end of June. The gambling giant created last February, when Paddy Power and Betfair joined forces, said that revenues grew 18 per cent to £759 million in the six months ended June 30th from £642 million during the same period last year. Operating profits grew 39 per cent to £147.6 million from £106.5 million over the same period. However, a £195.1 million charge for February’s merger left it with a £47.5 million loss. The group said that it expected full-year earnings to be £365-£385 million. Kingspan had strong results, reporting that pre-tax profit rose 54 per cent to €155 million in what was a record first half for the insulation and building materials maker. Revenues rose 19 per cent to €1.47 billion in the six months ended June 30th from €1.24 billion during the same period last year. Trading profit also rose by about 50 per cent, growing to €167.3 million from €111.7 million, well ahead of the €140 million and €150 million predicted by most analysts. Chief executive Gene Murtagh said the Cavan group expected the momentum to continue into the second half. IFA ROW OVER LEVIES The Irish Farmers’ Association (IFA) faces substantial losses following a row over the collection of levies from farmers. Larry Goodman’s ABP has thrown the cat among the pigeons by ceasing automatic collection levies on farm sales, a vital source of funding for the IFA. The company claims it was acting on foot of persistent complaints from farmers about the way the tariff was administered. The IFA, however, claims the move was designed to sabotage its funding arrangements and weaken its standing in the farming sector. In response, it cancelled ABP’s authorisation to collect it, effectively jettisoning up to €300,000 in contributions from ABP suppliers. Now all eyes on whether other processors will follow Goodman’s lead, a move that could have disastrous consequences for the farmers’ group, which is still reeling from a string of pay scandals involving former bosses. MOTOR INSURANCE CRISIS The Irish motor insurance market is in crisis, with premiums rising by almost 40 per cent a year. And there is little sign of relief for drivers. This week’s news that Gibraltar-based underwriter Zenith Insurance is to withdraw from the market will not lead to the same immediate crisis for policyholders as the Setanta collapse. Existing policies will remain in force and claims will be met. It further reduces competition in the market meaning premiums will probably continue to rise. Of course the problem appears to have been that previous competition for market share drove premiums down to unsustainable levels. Add in the high cost of claims here and you have a toxic mix which is hitting policyholders hard in the pocket. EMPLOYMENT RISES Amid all the dire warnings about Brexit, there was further good news for the economy this week with the Central Statistics Office’s Quarterly National Household Survey showing the number of people working in the State has reached two million for the first time since 2009. The survey revealed unemployment had also fallen by 23,400, or 11 per cent, in the year to the end of June, pushing the total number out of work down to 187,800, marking the 16th consecutive quarter in which unemployment has fallen. ADVERTISEMENT While unemployment rates are up, with the July figure at 8.3 per cent as against the previous 7.8 per cent, the change was due to an increase in the labour force, rather than newly unemployed people.       Topics: Albert Manifold Gene Murtagh Larry Goodman Paddy Power Eu Irish Farmers Organisation Irish Government Abp Apple CRH Goodman Group Holcim Kingspan Lafarge Europe Ireland United States Read More Dollar recovers from two-week lows in thin market trading More than 2,000 jobs saved by examinership in 2016 New year: Five ways tech can spring clean your life Should have bought bitcoin?

PC-Tablet News Rumors Updates Smartphones Apps Wearables Gaming Accessories Editorials Apple iPhone 7 rumors: Next iPhone to have dual SIM support, no 3.5mm headphone jack By James Miller - August 27, 2016 With the WWDC 2016 over and Apple having released iOS 10, all we’ve got to do is wait for the company to bring us their latest iPhone 7. New information by a Chinese mobile repair store ‘Rock Fix’ suggests that a few aspects of the phone will be different despite the wide-spread rumors of consumers’ expectations. The images were reported by Engadget and tell us what we can probably expect from the upcoming iPhone 7. iPhone 7 Design There have been news that the iPhone 7 will not have the 3.5mm headphone jack. Apple too ascertained that they would be ditching the traditional headphone jack to support audio playback through their lightning port. Rock Fix’s images also say that the new iPhone will offer dual-SIM capabilities. The first iPhone to do so, you may be able to use two SIM-cards on an iPhone after all this time. As rumored earlier too, the iPhone 7 will come with wireless charging capabilities so you are likely to see a SmartConnector at the back of the device. The phone will sport antennas towards the top of the phone on either side, probably to accommodate the change of modem chip on the GSM models. iPhone 7 Specifications The images reported by Engadget say that there will indeed be a dual-camera on one of the variants of the iPhone 7. So far the phone is expected to be released in three variants: iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus and iPhone 7 Premium. You will see the dual-camera set-up on the larger phone, but we don’t know if it’s going to be both the Plus and Premium that will get it. Rumors say the iPhone 7 Premium will come along with 3GB RAM in order to support the dual-camera set-up smoothly. A SanDisk memory chip that reads 256GB is also featured among the photographs telling us that the iPhone 7 will ditch the entry-level 16GB storage variant and will run with 32GB, 128GB, and 256GB of storage options. Another report draws light on the fact that some of the iPhone 7 models will come with Intel’s modem chips over Qualcomm’s solutions. The new 4.7-inch variants of the iPhone 7 will be made by a new vendor Pegatron, while the larger variants will continue to be manufactured by Foxconn.

However, there are already many rumors regarding the release date, but we think that there are two potential dates when this will most likely happen. According to a report from a trustworthy source, Apple will unveil its iPhone 7 device on September 7, 2016. However, before that, we remind you that Evan Blass, a well-known leaker, has tweeted that pre-orders for this device will start on September 9, 2016 and the in-store launch will happen on September 16, 2016. However, according to new a leak from AT&T retail staff, September 23 2016 might actually be the launch date of the iPhone 7. We can say that September 16 and September 23 sound ok for the release date of this new device, as Apple is expected to bring the new smartphone on the first or second Friday following the first day of pre-orders. We remind you that Blass has tweeted a few days ago, saying that he believes that iPhone 7 will be released on September 16, 2016. Blass said back then that he is quite confident about this date. He also quoted his previews tweet, where he stated that the iPhone 7 will be available in stores on September 16, 2016. When it comes to mobile leaks, Evan Blass has proved in the past that he has some pretty good informers. In other words, instead of believing some unverified AT&T leaks, we prefer to trust Blass’ leaks. However, let’s not forget that Apple hasn’t said anything about the release date of iPhone 7, so there’s nothing 100% sure. When do you think that Apple will release the iPhone 7? Have you saved any money to buy the next generation iPhone or are you going to buy it with a contract?

BERLIN, GERMANY - SEPTEMBER 19: A shopper ltries out the new Apple iPhone 6 at the Apple Store on the first day of sales of the new phone in Germany on September 19, 2014 in Berlin, Germany. (Photo: Sean Gallup/Getty Images) Fans of the Cupertino-company cannot wait for the iPhone 7 that is about to be unveiled in a couple of weeks. However, other news outlets say that the new Apple variant may have a shortage problem in time of its release in September. Supply Problems for iPhone 7 in its Release Business Insider reports that fans of the iPhone 7 cannot automatically buy the new smartphone in its launch due to a shortage problem with Apple latest flagship phone. Reasons for this is that Apple's suppliers are having trouble with making the components for the dual lens and the waterproof system that will be added to the iPhone 7. Also, if Apple followed its release date with the previous variants last year, the iPhone 7 might have a low supply in the beginning of the launch as some suppliers are trying to fix the low yield rates of their components. Meanwhile, Apple also has a dropped in sales for the past two quarters of this year. The company has experienced a major dropped in the demand with the upcoming iPhone 7 it's because of the lack of new features in the new models. The report further explained that Apple's placemen orders in the US are very conservative and the company's panel orders for the iPhone 7 are dropping around 20% in year-over-year. Which leaves one major suppliers such as Japan Display hungry for more orders. iPhone 7 Release Date The confirmed release of the iPhone 7 has just been announced all over the web with a Twitter post from Evan Blass, a well-known tipster for Apple variants. The tipster is confident that the Apple flagship will release on September 16. Pre-orders of the iPhone 7 online are expected to start on September 9. September 7 is still the big day that fans of the iPhone 7 will not miss out as the new variant will be presented to the public. For more iPhone 7 news and update stay tuned to Gamenguide!

Home News Reviews iPhone Apps Android Apps Windows Apps Top Mobiles Latest Mobiles Upcoming Mobiles PhoneRadar Explains Search PHONE FINDER COMPARE PHONES Officially Launched Apple to Release Two iPhone 8 Models with AMOLED Display & iPhone 7 SE in 2017 Apple will be launching iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus smartphones next month. The recent leaks also suggest the company to unveil a third device called iPhone 6 SE alongside the iPhone 7 & iPhone 7 Plus. The circular home button will be now replaced with a capacitive button along with Touch ID. While the Optical Image Stabilization (OIS) is only limited to iPhone 6S Plus last year, now in 2016, both the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are said to feature OIS. The base variant of iPhone 7 will be coming with 16GB while iPhone 7 Plus might start with 32GB of built-in storage. The Apple A10 powered iPhones will also skip the 3.5mm audio port and might come with lightning port EarPods. According to a Weibo post, few specifications of the 2017 iPhones are now confirmed. Apple will be launching iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone 7 SE smartphones in 2017. As rumoured earlier, the devices will be powered by Apple A11 chipset which is said to be built on 10nm architecture. Both the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus will be first smartphones from Apple to feature AMOLED display. Though the company is said to include AMOLED display in 2016 iPhones, it is later postponed for next year due to low production volume. OPPO, the second largest Chinese smartphone manufacturer, has recently launched the non-AMOLED variant of the much popular OPPO R9 due to the lack of higher production volume.   The iPhone 8 will sport 5-inch display while the iPhone 8 Plus will come with a 5.5-inch display. The third device, iPhone 7 SE will sport a 4.7-inch display. Unlike the iPhone 6S or the upcoming iPhone 7; the iPhone 7 SE will be the most expensive entry-level variant. It still comes with TFT display unlike the iPhone 8 or iPhone 8 Plus. Since there is a long time for the actual launch, we expect to see further changes while coming to the final products. Stay tuned for more updates!

Home Technology Science Politics Business Health Entertainment Sports Release Date of Apple iPhone 7 will be Sept 16 but with the likelihood of Supply Shortage Release Date of Apple iPhone 7 will be Sept 16 but with the likelihood of Supply Shortage Munawar GulAugust 27, 2016 Technology0 Comments 0 A new report said that Apple is on its way to introduce iPhone 7 & 7 Plus on September 6, while the actual release date is confirmed as 16th or third Friday of the month. Yet the heavy demands after the launch will rarely be met by the initial shipments of next iPhone. Similarly, for the last four months, Apple has traditionally registered record sales for the new iPhone models. But as per a Nikkei report, the tech giant seems to be much careful about 2016, due to which it reduced receiving new orders. It’s also reported that a major supplier confirmed the U.S. company’s placement of orders will be very conservative this year. Consequently, early buyers will likely to face supply shortage. It was also pointed by the same report that despite the small numbers of new iPhones shipment suppliers have to combat the production issues such as the unknown reasons for low output of components to be used for the device. According to Nikkei report, “If Apple sticks to its launch schedule from last year, there may not be enough supply at the beginning, as some suppliers are still trying to fix low yield rates of their components”. The reported also added that the likelihood of low volume shipments is quite obvious in the next iPhone launch to come. According to analysts’ angle, Apple could have been instigated by shrinking revenues delivered by the tech titan’s iPhone business, due to which it is blamed for the decision to adjust downward the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus production numbers. However, sales numbers of Apple’s iPhone declined in the last two quarters this year and the similar trend will continue until the end of September. Similarly, production of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus is expected to be lowered for the push of 2016 iPhone or the availability of only 74 million units will be made, up to the close of 2016. But, when it comes to contrast, the tech giant flooded the market with 84 million units of the duo of the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus that were almost insufficient, Nikkei said. Apple remains firm on the next iPhone prospect that the device will double up on the storage configurations with fresh color options to be added to the menu. In addition, it is reported that buyers will have the range of iPhone that will be served in Deep Blue and Space Black flavours, on top of the familiar Champagne Gold, Rose Gold and Silver White with editions of 32GB, 128GB, and 256GB, while the inside power will be combo of A10 processing chip and iOS 10. According to Forbes, the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus release date will probably happen in the third week of September following the pre-orders that will start on the 9th, pricing at $649 for the regular-size unlock version and $749 for the supersized build.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile iPhone 7 Is Facing Supply Issues – Will Apple Extend the Actual Launch Date? By Omar Sohail Posted Aug 27, 2016 12Shares Share Tweet Submit Both iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus might be facing supply shortage issues just weeks before their imminent arrival to the smartphone market. While Apple will not be able to extend the official announcement date of the smartphones, it may be forced to extend the actual global release date of both devices till the supply number shows much more agreeable numbers. Faulty Components Are the Core Reason Behind Apple’s iPhone 7 Supply Problems Macrumors reports that an industry source close to the matter has stated the following regarding supply issues: “If Apple sticks to its launch schedule from last year, there may not be enough supply at the beginning, as some suppliers are still trying to fix low yield rates of their components”. As stated earlier, Apple will not be able to extend the data of iPhone 7’s official announcement, and while that’s commendable of the company, it could lead to disastrous results, such as low yield rates, higher costs for manufacturers, and subsequently less volume to deliver to customers. According to Yuanta Investment Consulting analyst Jeff Pu, he is under the impression that total number of iPhone 7 builds will be 10 million less than that of the iPhone 6s which was released last year. Advertisement “We estimate total iPhone 7 builds to be 74 (million) in 2H16F, compared to 84 (million) for iPhone 6s in 2H15. Together with pricing pressure, we expect most Apple food chain suppliers to see (year-on-year) revenue decline for the rest of the year.” Apple’s iPhone 7 is expected to be announced on September 9, with a release date that could be in between the September 16-23 period. The smartphone has been reported to come with better waterproofing capabilities than its predecessor, along with an A10 chipset, slightly bigger battery life and a storage model that will boast capacity as high as 256GB. Let us hope that the launch date of the smartphone is not delayed any further than it needs to be.

Jose Rufino Dy Buco |Monday, August 29 2016 Like Us Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Pin it (Reuters/Gustau Nacarino) There is a lot of anticipation regarding the two new smartphones of the leading brands, Samsung and Apple. With the year soon concluding, many are anticipating the release of the Apple iPhone 7 Plus as well as Samsung's Galaxy Note 7. Both product lines have been strong in the smartphone industry, especially with the loaded features and specifications they are expected to bring. Though there has yet to be any official news on how the two new phones will be like, there have been many rumors regarding the specifications of the iPhone 7 Plus and the Galaxy Note 7. There have also been several leaks hinting at the features included in the new smartphones. For design, both phones are expected to mirror the same type of aesthetics presented in the previous models of their product lines. Reports indicated that Samsung and Apple are not planning to innovate their designs in a major way. However, the selling point of the Galaxy Note 7 is said to be its hardware and performance. It was shown that the new smartphone could include a larger camera sensor as well as an improved flash. The device is said to utilize the Qualcomm Snapdragon 821, which will boost the performance of the phone. This will include the new Kyro cores, bringing a faster transistor for the device. As for the iPhone 7 Plus, Apple is expected to include a dual camera for the back of the phone. This dual camera feature can bring higher quality photos compared to the previous models of the iPhone. In addition, the new iPhone 7 Plus could include a change in the antenna bands in order to better sync with the new Apple gears expected. The iPhone 7 Plus storage space is said to start at 32 GB, instead of a 16 GB variant. In contrast, Samsung Note 7 could start with 64 GB, as well as having an expandable storage with a Micro SD card. However, there has yet to be any news on when the upcoming smartphones will release to the market.

Screenshot: Cult of Mac By Brandon Shaw I know, you’re tired of hearing, “Frank Ocean’s new album is amazing!!!” Me too. I’m interested less in the album itself, and more in what it means for the future of music. With a pair of Apple Music exclusives, Frank Ocean pulled a fast one on his old record label — and shook up the the entire record industry. It’s the latest indicator that Apple sits at the center of a rapidly evolving music industry, where rules and strategies are changing by the minute. Now everyone from Spotify to Universal Music Group is frantically trying to figure out what to do. A bit of Frank Ocean history Here’s a recap if you aren’t familiar with the back story: Frank Ocean released Channel Orange in 2012 to much acclaim. Everyone went bananas for it. He won all kinds of awards. He also gave a weird and really terrible performance at the Grammys (we’re talking Nick Jonas guitar solo bad). In the four years since his first album (and in the last year in particular), ‘ol Frank has been teasing his next album, supposedly titled Boys Don’t Cry. Teaser release dates came and went, and Frank started to seem a bit like the boy who cried wolf. (Side note: The name of the album should be Boys Don’t Cry Wolf amirite???) What happened last week Frank Ocean’s Endless is a “visual album” — and an Apple Music exclusive. Photo: Frank Ocean Last week, Ocean pulled off something that I’m calling a “Double-Beyoncé” with a hint of a “Classic Prince Two-Step” (more on that in a moment). On Friday, with no prior announcement, Ocean released a 45-minute “visual album” titled Endless as an Apple Music exclusive. It’s basically one giant music video. Endless features 45 minutes of new music that’s part R&B, part hip-hop, part suuuuper chill, and all Frank Ocean. Endless is also part staircase-building tutorial. Not a joke. Photo: Frank Ocean Oh but wait, there’s more. After releasing what many people (just me) are calling, “a much longer, much more relaxed Thriller video,” Ocean released an entirely different album the very next day. Back-to-back releases without any promo ahead of time? Now that’s what I call a Double-Beyoncé! His new “audio album” is called Blonde and is an iTunes and Apple Music exclusive. But here’s the really fascinating thing: While Endless was released under the Def Jam label, Blonde was released independently under Ocean’s own label, coincidentally named Boys Don’t Cry. Why does this matter? Apparently, by releasing the visual album Endless, Ocean fulfilled his contract with Def Jam. What did he do to celebrate? He released an entirely new “actual album” as an Apple Music and iTunes exclusive the very next day. Apple Music exclusives matter Apple Music has been making a name for itself, primarily through streaming exclusives. Apple has had a head start on releases by artists like Chance The Rapper, Drake, Adele (and the Stranger Things soundtrack) — and reportedly pays top dollar for the exclusives. Increasingly, services like Apple Music and Tidal are setting themselves apart with these streaming exclusives and becoming more powerful than the labels themselves. Why take a record deal with Def Jam when you can get an exclusive streaming deal with Apple? This isn’t to say that Endless is particularly bad, but a music video won’t climb the Billboard charts, and doesn’t deliver the same profitability of a regular audio album (you know, like the one Ocean had in his back pocket the whole time). A recap of Frank Ocean’s last few years Frank Ocean’s “audio album” is the real deal. Image: Wikipedia/fair use Let’s recap the Frank Ocean story: 2012: Signs to Def Jam. Releases Channel Orange. Everyone loves it. 2013: Chillin. “You guys wanna hear more?” 2014: Chillin. “My new album is coming guys!” 2015: Chillin. “Coming so soon! It’s gonna be amazing!” 2016: Chillin. “I swear! #boysdontcry” Last Friday: “Check out my new visual album! Hey Def Jam, we good?” Last Saturday: “Check out my actual album. Hey Apple Music, sup!” #nochill. This dude basically just sidestepped his existing recording contract by pulling a pretty sneaky move; he technically fulfilled his contract, but then immediately released another album on the side. Now that’s what I call a Classic Prince Two-Step. (In order to get out a of a recording contract, Prince famously changed his name to an unpronounceable symbol, effectively two-stepping around a tricky legal battle). Who wins? And who loses? Here’s a list of winners and losers in this scenario, from most winningest to least. Most winningest: Frank Ocean fans, for getting a double dose of new music after years of teasing. Also winning: Frank Ocean, for being sneaky and releasing his new album independently as an Apple Music exclusive (and presumably making much more money). Still winning: Apple Music, for locking down yet another exclusive. Two, in fact. People will sign up just to stream Blonde and Endless. Losing: Spotify, for being a sore loser and claiming that exclusives are “bad for artists, bad for consumers, and bad for the whole industry.” Please. Biggest loser: Def Jam, for missing out on Ocean’s real album, and instead getting what basically amounts to a really long Home Depot commercial (albeit with a dope soundtrack). What does it all mean? Is Apple Music the new record label? Will artists cut out the middle man and start leaving traditional labels for greener pastures? We’ll have to wait and see. All I know is, Frank Ocean managed to pull off the heist of the year. Oh, by the way, have you heard about Frank Ocean’s new “movie album” coming out? It’s the logical next step.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Archive Proof in the paint?: Hilltop House graffiti could signal what town plans to salvage Saturday Aug 27, 2016 at 2:31 PM Aug 27, 2016 at 3:48 PM Matthew Cabe Staff Writer @DP_MatthewCabe APPLE VALLEY — Three months after escrow closed on the Hilltop House, town officials toured the historic site that, today, serves the needs of taggers rather than dignitaries and celebrities. The graffiti that riddled the property’s drained swimming pool and patio on Aug. 16 was new. That fact was observable in both the still-wet paint and in the topical nature of a vulgar, two-word stance on Donald Trump scrawled atop the pool’s steps. “The graffiti here today is about three weeks old,” Apple Valley Code Enforcement Manager Jim Andersen said. “We have a contract and work on graffiti removal every two to three months.” And while the crude sketches of Batman and a frowning Superman are eyesores, they point to which sections might already be deemed salvageable despite there being no official plan for the property. Town spokeswoman Kathie Martin told the Daily Press on Friday that Apple Valley wants to retain the significance of the location, but in a way that is safe and accessible for citizens to enjoy; however, retaining Hilltop House’s significance and keeping it safe aren’t exactly goals that share common ground. First constructed in the 1950s, the house once hovered over the town as a lavish nod to possibility for prospective developers and homeowners. In 1965, it was featured in John Myhers’ madcap comedy, “Saturday Night Bath in Apple Valley,” which — five decades later — feels more like a feature-length advertisement for the then-budding town than it does a Mel Brooks-style laugh riot. In the opening credits of that largely forgotten film, Myhers gave special thanks to “Mr. Newt Bass of Apple Valley, California” for allowing the director to film inside the home that just two years later succumbed to fire. “It burned down in 1967,” Andersen said. “It was winter, and there was ice on the road leading up to the house.” That road is deceptively steep, and firefighters couldn’t get their trucks beyond the ice in order to save the house, according to Andersen. After the fire, Hilltop House was rebuilt and utilized as a space for conferences and weddings while ownership changed hands through the years. But now, unlike the pool and patio area situated on the property’s southern end, the house sits in ruin. A portion of the second floor has collapsed, the carport was almost entirely destroyed by another fire and there’s too much graffiti on what’s left of both the interior and exterior walls to bother with removal. In 2012, when the house was owned by the Las Vegas-based 360 Apple West LLC, former Apple Valley Fire Protection District Chief Art Bishop — who was elected to the Town Council less than three months later — hinted at a possible future for the property. Bishop told the Daily Press the area would be ideal for a park with picnic tables and a shaded structure. Even then, though, what’s left of Hilltop House itself wasn’t a factor. "It's rather dangerous and it may have to be razed," Bishop said. "That would be a shame because it's a monument to Apple Valley's history." During the recent tour with town officials, Martin said demolition of the house is one option the town will consider once an ad hoc committee is formed. “We don’t expect that the structure will be rebuilt or retained,” Martin said. “We’re looking more at an observation-deck style destination at the end of a trail.” It’s possible, then, that the patio and pool areas — from which graffiti is removed on a regular basis — might be salvaged for part of the observation deck. Martin added that demolition was an option entertained by the Apple Valley Legacy Trail Foundation, the organization that initially worked toward acquiring the property and raised $580,350 toward that goal last August. LTF committee members Steve Richard and Donald Tatera could not be reached for comment, but Martin said the town will seek input from “the people that kind of laid the foundation for this (purchase) to happen.” Martin previously confirmed that at least one of the grants the LTF received — $160,000 awarded by the California Department of Parks Recreation Land and Water Conservation Fund — helped fund the town’s more than $300,000 purchase of the property. As a result, the town must meet certain requirements laid out by the LWCF grant program, which includes the acquisition resulting in an “outdoor recreational opportunity for the public’s benefit” within three years of the completion of acquisition, according to a previous Daily Press report. Meanwhile, Martin reiterated that nothing is set in stone at this point, adding that the town expects to work with community groups and the Apple Valley Parks & Recreation Commission on a plan for Hilltop House “in the very near future.” “It will all be up for discussion,” she said.

Apple has emerged as a stock buyback powerhouse in recent years, but why does the company choose to reward its shareholders this way? Andrew Tonner (TMFTheDude) Aug 27, 2016 at 3:33PM Image source: Getty Images. As one of the most successful companies in history, investors may understandably wonder whether aging tech giant Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) can deliver the same juicy returns for which it's so famous. Though still certainly a force in the investing world, today's Apple relies on a more diverse playbook, including share buybacks and dividends to generate returns for its shareholders, rather than relying solely on torrent earnings and profit growth, as it once did. Case in point, Apple has emerged as something of a share buyback and dividend powerhouse since initiating its capital return program in 2012.  Apple's share buyback history Thanks to its truly monumental financial resources -- $159 billion in net cash and investments as of its most recent quarter -- Apple has developed an impressive track record of returning cash to shareholders via buybacks and dividends. Here's a quick snapshot of Apple's share repurchase history over the past four fiscal years. Apple Stock Buyback History (ASR & Open Market Purchases) FY 2013 FY 2014 FY 2015 FY 2016 Number of shares (in thousands) 336,832 502,284 332,552 187,171 Average repurchase price  $68.13  $89.59  $117.35  $106.85 ASR amounts (in $US millions)  $22,950  $45,000  $39,026  $20,000 Data source: Apple SEC filings.  As of its most recent quarterly report, Apple has utilized roughly $127 billion of the $175 billion the company has earmarked for stock buybacks. That's an absolutely incredible about of capital committed to repurchasing Apple's shares, especially considering the company's entire market capitalization of $573 billion. It demonstrates how Apple can utilize its massive financial resources to continue to create returns for its investors, even if its days of breakneck growth lie behind it. It also bears noting that Apple has allocated a disproportionate amount of its capital return program toward stock buybacks instead of dividends. In fact, Apple has earmarked 68% of the $250 billion in its capital return program specifically to fuel share buybacks. As such, Apple's clear preference toward stock buybacks also suggests they contain some kind of advantage over dividends. Why is that? Why do companies buy back stock? With chapters of corporate finance textbooks dedicated to the subject, breaking down the advantages and drawbacks of stock buybacks, especially when compared to cash dividends, can quickly grow esoteric. I don't want to put you to sleep, here, but it's handy for investors to have a general framework for why companies pursue stock buybacks, so let's quickly review.  At their most basic, buybacks are one of two principle methods through which a company can reward its shareholders with their excess cash flow; the other is dividends. Generally speaking, stock buybacks benefit investors by helping increase a company's stock price. Here, it's helpful to think of company's profits as a pie. Buying back stock reduces the number of shares entitled to a company's profits. It's akin to reducing the number of slices of the pie, making each slice more valuable. As Homer Simpson would say, "Mmmmm. Pie." Additionally, stock buybacks carry an additional tax advantage. Investors who own a stock for more than a year are taxed at the lower long-term capital gains rate when they sell their stock compared to dividends, which are taxed as ordinary income. So as a general rule of thumb, stock buybacks help increase a stock's price and typically result in a lower tax bill when investors sell their shares. Stock repurchases can also be viewed, in theory, as a sign that a company sees its shares as undervalued, though this can prove tenuous in practice. Companies are aware of this exact effect, and some will attempt to use this "signal" to support their stock price. For example, the now-defunct Lehman Brothers famously instituted a stock buyback in late January 2008, ostensibly in an attempt to instill confidence in its rickety stock price. Ten months later, the company no longer existed. To be sure, many companies use buybacks to reward their investors in a rational and ethical manner, but it's important to caveat that some companies use it for more self-serving aims as well. Either way, at a high level, stock buybacks should be thought of as a more tax-efficient way for a company to reward investors than dividends in cases when its shares are undervalued. Companies with low P/E ratios, like Apple, can benefit tremendously from stock buybacks. But it's important to note we're just scratching the surface on this important and somewhat complex topic.

For Great design Better battery Improved keyboard Against Still pricey Screen too low-res Update: iPhone 6 prices have continued to drop, and now that iOS 10 has landed, it could very well be the best choice for you. Sure, it's not nearly as fast or powerful as Apple's new iPhone 7, but our review now reflects how 2014's flagship goes against the iPhone SE. You'll also find helpful guides inserted throughout to point you in the direction of the best accessories for your iPhone 6, whether it's old or brand new. Lastly, some iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus users have encountered something that's being referred to as "touch disease". In other words, your phone is becoming unresponsive to touch. Unfortunately, Apple has yet to publicly acknowledge the issue, but you can check out why the issue occurs at the link above. Original review follows below. Why do we have the Apple iPhone 6? Well, back in 2013, despite record sales, the Cupertino brand was heading for a fall. The brand had been trading on the same phone for four years, and something big was needed to keep it current. So with that, the iPhone 6, and its bigger brother, the iPhone 6 Plus, were born to keep Apple at the sharp end of a market that was starting to lust after powerful, big-screen smartphones with clever and premium design. Compare: all the best iPhone 6 deals The iPhone 6 certainly addresses a number of the problems Apple had developed, coming with a much larger screen (although not dramatically increasing the size of the phone) a boosted processor, better camera, improved battery and - crucially - overhauled design. Much of the ground work that went into the iPhone 6S was done here, with the iPhone 6. This is the sixth iPhone I've reviewed, and there's a distinct sense that this one is really rather different. I wrote in 2013 that Apple was becoming more aware that the time when it could define what consumers would buy in the smartphone was ending – and with the 4.7-inch screen, it clearly had to admit defeat in the smaller screen market. There will be some who will miss that 4-inch screen size, maintaining that they don't want a bigger display on their phone – but nearly all of those people won't have spent any appreciable time with a larger device, and I believe that a good portion of you thinking you need a smaller phone will quickly come to appreciate the power a bigger handset brings, without compromising quality. Apple's now appeased those longing for a new 4-inch handheld though, with the launch of the iPhone SE. It sports the specs of the iPhone 6S, uses the body of the now-discontinued iPhone 5S and sports a lower price tag than the iPhone 6, giving the latter some tough new competition. But while the iPhone 6 has answered a lot of the problems I've had with previous iterations of Apple's handsets, there are some issues that still swirled when I handled the phone for the first time – and many of them persist even now that the iPhone 6 has been superseded. Why did Apple decide to not join the masses with a really high-res screen? Why is the iPhone 6 still one of the most expensive phones on the market? Has Apple done enough to improve the quite dire battery life of previous models, especially at a time when many high-end Android phones are easily chugging through a day's worth of hard use without thirsting for a charger's caress? Let's take a quick look at the price – and it's not pretty. iPhone 6 price and release date At launch, you were looking at $649 or £539 for the 16GB version, $750 or £619 for the 64GB option and $850 or £699 for the 128GB model. Compare this to the iPhone 7, which launched in September for the same price, but with an increased baseline of 32GB instead of 16GB. The high-end model is also the same price as the iPhone 6 launched with, but stocks in 256GB - double the amount of storage. You can no longer purchase the iPhone 6 through the Apple Store, but when it was available last, the price had dropped as low as $549 (£459, AU$929) for the 16GB version and $649 (£539, AU$1,079) for the 64GB option, with the 128GB handset having been discontinued with the arrival of the iPhone 6S. We wouldn't be surprised to see that prices have continued to plummet. Even so, it's going for about as much as you'd pay for a brand new Android flagship just a few months after launch, yet the iPhone 6 is no longer the top model in its range. Lastly, you've got the iPhone SE, which has the same features as the newer iPhone 6S for $150 (£100, AU$250) less than the iPhone 6. You'll have to compromise on screen size, but you could get a better phone for less. Design Let's take a look at the first thing most people will wonder about before picking up the iPhone 6: how will it actually feel in the hand? This is a big departure for Apple, marking a time when it's admitted that the industrial, sharp design of the last four iPhone models is a little outdated and needs to up the ergonomics to really compete. Well, with the Apple iPhone 6 we're looking at one of the thinnest and sleekest handsets in the market – still. It's got a strong combination of metal back (which feels exceptionally premium, borrowing bucketloads of design language from the iPad Air) and the way the screen curves into the chassis gives it a slight lozenge feel. One of the thinnest phones in the world The iPhone 6 looks the business, and at 6.9mm thin it's very nice to hold, though phones like the Samsung Galaxy S6 and Moto Z has since edged it out at 6.8mm and 5.1mm thick, respectively. I do still feel that phones that push harder on ergonomics are a better choice though – the HTC One M9 bows out at the back and fits in the palm a little better – but that's quibbling. This iPhone just feels really well made. Apple has always favored a flatter phone than the rest of the market though, and placed on a desk it looks great. It does feel great in the hand too, but as said others impress more if I'm being hyper-critical. There's also the issue of the large plastic strips that flow through the top and bottom of the device. Given metal is a nightmare material to try and get radio signal to penetrate, these are clearly there to offset that. The plastic strips detract and are not flush with the chassis While the plastic does seem to give good signal performance for the most part, it's nothing amazing, and to my eyes they're a little unsightly and ruin the sleek back of the iPhone 6; their presence seems at odds with Apple's design ethos. The other big design change is to the power button, which has now been moved to the right-hand side of the phone. This makes a lot of sense and, given the phone is now a larger device at 138.1 x 67 x 6.9mm, hitting the top of the handset is a much harder task, so moving the button is the right thing to do. Like the rest of the exterior buttons, the power key is raised and easy to hit in both left and right hand modes. It's metallic, and crucially doesn't have the same rattle that I criticized on the iPhone 5S and iPhone SE. The new raised buttons However, that doesn't mean the metallic keys don't have a little wiggle to them. Running your hand up and down the sides idly will result in you noticing a very slight looseness to the power and volume buttons... I'm in danger of being too critical here, but for the price it's not the sort of thing I expect to see. The other important design change here is the camera now protrudes slightly on the rear of the phone. It's good to see that happening, as it shows that Apple isn't willing to compromise on camera quality in order to just whack in a thinner phone. Looking for the best iPhone 6 cases? Check this out The protrusion is a little worrying in that laying the Apple iPhone 6 down flat on a table could see scratches appearing, but the sapphire glass that covers the lens should ensure that's pretty safe. The camera protrudes but you won't notice it day to day The rest of the iPhone 6 is very similar to the iPhone 5S, with the speakers at the bottom flanking the Lightning port. Well, I say speakers: it's just the one speaker, but thanks to the slightly elongated bottom of the phone you won't cover it when holding the phone in landscape orientation. This was irritating when trying to game or watch a movie without headphones on older iPhones – but this upgrade, combined with the lightness of the iPhone 6, means you won't have a similar problem for the most part, as the hands sit lower and free of the speaker generally. Sadly the headphone port still resides at the bottom of the iPhone 6, meaning you'll still probably get your phone out of your pocket the wrong way around when listening to music. The iPhone in Space Gray Going back to the iPhone 6 after a prolonged spell using the iPhone 6S as a daily driver, it's remarkable how much lighter the older phone feels in the hand. You can feel every one of those extra 14 grams, and it's the one area in which the newer iPhone suffers by comparison. Let me make one thing very clear though: the Apple iPhone 6 is another iconic handset in terms of design for Apple. It's not the best looking on the market (I'm still giving that title to the HTC One M9), but it's definitely right up there, and for the price I'd expect nothing less. At launch, the iPhone 6 was available in Space Gray, Silver and Gold, but you might have a hard time finding your preferred color now since Apple no longer sells the phone. Fast forward to today, Apple's iPhone 7 is offered in a few more colors: Jet Black, Black, and Rose Gold - a variant that was introduced alongside the iPhone 6S.

Imperial Valley News Heart of the Matter White House Announces New Commitments to the Equal Pay Pledge Print Email Details Written by White House Category: National News Published: 27 August 2016 Washington, DC - Friday, on Women’s Equality Day, we are announcing new signatories to the White House Equal Pay Pledge. This pledge was launched at the first-ever United State of Women Summit, encouraging companies from across the American economy to take action to advance equal pay. These 29 newly-committed employers bring the total number to more than fifty companies and organizations that collectively employ millions of Americans. The new commitments are from a diverse range of employers, including Apple, CVS, Facebook, Target, and Visa. Equal Pay has been an Administration priority since President Obama signed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act into law as his first piece of legislation. Policies that ensure fair pay for all Americans and that help businesses to attract the strongest talent can not only narrow the pay gap, but also boost productivity and benefit our economy. As noted in the President’s Proclamation on Women’s Equality Day, this day commemorates the 1920 certification of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, granting women the right to vote. It is also the day that we observe the continued work towards gender equity for all women and girls. View the additional commitments and statements from signatories below, and learn more about President Obama's record on empowering women and girls. By signing the Equal Pay Pledge, these employers are: Acknowledging the critical role businesses must play in reducing the national pay gap. Committing to conducting an annual company-wide gender pay analysis across occupations. Reviewing hiring and promotion processes and procedures to reduce unconscious bias and structural barriers. Embedding equal pay efforts into broader enterprise-wide equity initiatives. Pledging to take these steps as well as identify and promote other best practices that will close the national wage gap to ensure fundamental fairness for all workers. Companies and organizations interested in signing are encouraged to take the Equal Pay Pledge here. WHITE HOUSE EQUAL PAY PLEDGE The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act was the first piece of legislation President Obama signed into law. Policies that ensure fair pay for all Americans and that help businesses attract the strongest talent can not only narrow the gender pay gap, but also boost productivity and benefit our economy. Yet, the typical woman working full-time all year in the United States only earns 79 percent of what a typical man working full-time all year earns. While the gap has narrowed slightly over the past few years, there is much more work to be done to ensure fair pay for all. Building on the Administration’s numerous actions to close the national pay gap, the White House challenged businesses to take the Equal Pay Pledge. Several U.S. private sector companies have come together in support of advancing equal pay. We applaud the growing number of countries that have already made significant progress in closing their gender wage gap. Despite passage of the Equal Pay Act of 1963, which requires equal pay for equal work, the gender pay gap in the United States persists. Women working full-time earn only 79 percent of men’s wages, and we are committed to taking action individually and collectively to reduce that national pay gap. We believe that businesses must play a critical role in reducing the national pay gap. Towards that end, we commit to conducting an annual company-wide gender pay analysis across occupations; reviewing hiring and promotion processes and procedures to reduce unconscious bias and structural barriers; and embedding equal pay efforts into broader enterprise-wide equity initiatives. We pledge to take these steps as well as identify and promote other best practices that will close the national wage gap to ensure fundamental fairness for all workers. We received a very positive response to the pledge and welcome our new signatories, including the employers below. These signatories put forth their pledges as follows: A.T. Kearney: A.T. Kearney is passionate about and committed to diversity and inclusion.  We provide our employees with equal opportunities to contribute, develop, and succeed irrespective of gender, race, religion or sexual orientation. Diversity enables us to achieve immediate impact and growing advantage – for our clients, our people and the communities in which we work and live. We believe that equal pay to promote diversity and inclusion is a business imperative. Our approach to diversity and inclusion has and will continue to evolve with the changing needs of our business and our people. We offer global programs that create an inclusive environment and culture, ensuring all employees feel comfortable bringing their best selves to work each day. We enable our employees to achieve their personal and professional aspirations. A.T. Kearney is proud to collaborate with the White House and enthusiastically adds our name to the Equal Pay Pledge. Akamai Technologies: Akamai Technologies is pleased to sign the White House Equal Pay Pledge. This pledge aligns with the expectations we have of ourselves to lead with a sense of transparency, while embracing diversity and respect for all employees. At Akamai, we seek to ensure every employee can work in an environment where they are valued and able to work at their best. We believe in fair and equitable pay for all our employees, and we are committed to monitoring our pay practices regularly and to making adjustments if necessary to deliver on this pledge. Anheuser-Busch: Anheuser-Busch is proud to sign the Equal Pay Pledge. We value equality throughout all levels of our organization, and believe diversity enriches our workforce. This commitment to inclusivity begins with our mission - to be the best beer company, bringing people together for a better world - and extends to our meritocracy-based compensation practices. At Anheuser-Busch, we believe in equal pay for equal work. We use a rigorous and gender-blind compensation process that was developed and validated by independent experts. We recognize that there is still much work to do to create a truly equal playing field in the workforce. It is our ambition to lead the change and create more opportunities for women in the beer industry. Today, six of our 12 U.S. breweries are led by female head brewmasters, and women now represent the majority (51 percent) of our marketing organization. In support of our workforce and their families, this year we introduced a new parental leave policy that offers 100% paid Parental Bonding leave for all parents, on top of paid Maternity Leave for a birth mother. Apple: Equal work deserves equal pay. This past year, Apple looked at the total compensation for U.S. employees and closed the gaps we found. We’ve achieved pay equity in the United States for similar roles and performance. Women employees at Apple earn one dollar for every dollar male employees earn. We’re now analyzing the salaries, bonuses, and annual stock grants of all our employees worldwide. If a gap exists, we’ll address it. And we’ll continue our work to make sure we maintain pay equity. Chobani: Since day one, diversity and inclusiveness have been at the core of Chobani. We’re proud to stand with other leading businesses to give one voice to a simple, common sense principle: women deserve equal pay for equal work. We were founded with the belief that everyone on our team deserves the same chance to achieve their dreams and live up to their full potential. By joining the White House in taking this important pledge, we’re committing to continuously reviewing our practices to ensure that, as we grow, we never stray from our founding principles – and that our hiring, promotion and compensation practices and procedures stick to our deeply-held belief that women deserve equal opportunity. The Coca-Cola Company: The Coca-Cola Company values and celebrates diversity. This includes a long-standing commitment to equal opportunity that spans our employment practices and development of existing employees. There is overwhelming evidence that achieving equality and empowerment for women has both immediate impacts that benefit them directly and broader ripple effects that are good for society. We have made meaningful strides as a company in our equal opportunity efforts. Still, we recognize there is more we can learn by building upon best practices across the U.S. private sector.  We are pleased, therefore, to join the Equal Pay Pledge and work with the Administration and other partners towards reducing the national gender pay gap. CVS Health: At CVS Health, we are committed to fulfilling our company’s purpose of helping people on their path to better health by living our values, including integrity, accountability, caring, collaboration and innovation. By living our values, we embrace a dedication to paying our colleagues equitably regardless of their gender. We take a purposeful and systematic approach to evaluate compensation to ensure we are accountable to our pay equity commitment. We actively work to seek out, listen to and leverage the voices of our diverse colleagues, customers, clients, and communities. For our company, diversity and innovation go hand in hand and we strive to model best practices to promote and develop diverse talent.  Our CEO serves as the executive sponsor of CVS Health’s Women’s Success Network, one of our largest Colleague Resource Groups.  And we have been recognized as a best practice company by the 20/20 Women on Boards Initiative.  We value the contributions of all of our colleagues and we are proud to join other leading employers in signing this pledge and making a commitment to this important issue. Delta Air Lines: At Delta Air Lines, the very nature of our business is bringing people together. We rely on a worldwide family of Delta Air Lines people 80,000 strong to care for our customers and ensure they get where they’re going promptly and safely, regardless of the origin or destination. Our success is built on diversity, where our differences make us stronger and all people are welcomed, supported and – above all – treated equally. We’re proud to join the White House in signing the Equal Pay Pledge and voicing our commitment to fairness and diversity in the workplace, which is reflective of our long-standing commitment of pay equality among all Delta Air Lines employees. Dropbox: Dropbox is honored to sign the White House Equal Pay Pledge and join the other companies who have taken a stand on this issue. Gender equality and equal pay are priorities for us, and they are part of our deep commitment to creating an equitable workplace that includes and supports employees of every background and identity. Our products are used around the globe by millions of people from all cultures and backgrounds, and our team needs to reflect the world we’re building for. At Dropbox we review all of our hiring and HR processes for potential bias, including a gender impact analysis at every compensation and promotion cycle. Additionally, we've built inclusive leadership into our framework for managers, and all of our senior leadership and nearly all of our employees have participated in unconscious bias training. While we are proud of our track record of compensating our employees fairly and equitably — from our most junior team members to our senior leaders — we know there is more work to be done in order to create a world in which both men and women have the same opportunities and choices. Dunkin’ Brands: Dunkin' Brands is committed to gender pay equity, and we are honored to join the White House in the Equal Pay Pledge.  At Dunkin' Brands we regularly review our pay practices to ensure pay equity and strongly believe that a corporate culture in which each person is valued, respected and earns equal pay for equal work, delivers better business results. EY: EY is committed to pay equity and a culture of inclusion. Equity in opportunities, advancement, and compensation is a business imperative, and we work hard to promote fair practices for all of our women and men. EY’s leadership is actively engaged in fostering gender equality at EY and in the marketplace. Facebook: At Facebook we value those who bring varying perspectives, for many reasons including background, community, culture, race, ethnicity - and gender. We call this cognitive diversity, and we want more of it. It propels our mission: to give people the power to share and make the world more open and connected. Facebook is a longtime supporter of equal pay. We regularly review our compensation practices to ensure pay equity, and have done so for many years. We complete thorough statistical analyses to compare the compensation of men and women performing similar work. As such, we are proud to share that at Facebook, men and women earn the same.  We encourage efforts to establish methods to close the wage gaps around the world. General Motors: General Motors is pleased to sign The White House Equal Pay Pledge. We believe strongly in gender equity, and we are dedicated to having a diverse and welcoming workplace that values the contributions of all employees. We know that a diverse workforce promotes fresh, innovative thinking that translates into both a competitive advantage for GM and winning products for our customers. To this end, among other efforts, GM has employee resource groups, whose mission is to attract, engage, develop and retain a diverse mix of talented employees to positively affect GM’s performance, through networking and professional development opportunities. GM is supporting this pledge because it reflects our shared belief that employees’ gender should not factor into compensation decisions. We believe that fair and equitable pay should be an essential element of any successful business model and are proud to stand with other companies that share this same value. The Hartford: At The Hartford, gender equality is a top business priority.  The Hartford prides itself on its diverse workforce and inclusive culture, and its commitment to equality for ALL employees. The Hartford, recently named as one of twenty-six firms on Bloomberg Financial Services Gender-Equality Index for demonstrating strong commitment to gender equality, is proud to take the next step in signing the White House’s Equal Pay Pledge.   The Hershey Company: At The Hershey Company, diversity and inclusion is a commitment that is embedded in who we are.  It’s about advancing our vision, our culture, and our environment, so everyone can bring a meaningful contribution.  As part of this commitment, we believe that discrimination has no place in our workforce, which is why we have a no-tolerance policy. Our policy is to extend opportunities and terms and conditions of employment to qualified applicants and employees on an equal basis regardless of an individual’s race, color, gender, age, national origin, religion, citizenship status, marital status, sexual orientation, gender identity, transgender status, physical or mental disability, protected veteran status, genetic information, pregnancy, or any other categories protected by applicable law.  For wages, this includes equal pay for equal work. Hilton: At Hilton, we are proud of our long history of supporting a diverse and inclusive workplace. Our goal is clear - we strive for an inclusive work environment that allows all of our Team Members to be comfortable bringing their entire selves to work every day.   Simply put, our culture is a reflection of the backgrounds, passions and perspectives of all of our Team Members around the world. To be the most hospitable company in the world, we must also represent the many different cultures, backgrounds and viewpoints of our guests, which includes supporting and empowering women at every level of our organization.  In fact, women make up more than 50 percent of our global workforce. In this regard, we are honored to join the White House in signing the Equal Pay Pledge.  We are committed to advancing our efforts in ensuring equity not only in our pay practices, but also across recruitment, learning and development, benefits, and our overall Team Member value proposition. In doing so, we continue to deliver on our promise of a great environment, great careers and great rewards for all of our Team Members. Supporting women in the workplace is part of who we are. In fact, we provide a wide-range of opportunities for women such as our Women’s Team Member Resource Group, Women’s Executive Networking Program, and Women in Leadership Excellence Program in partnership with the University of Virginia. Most recently, we were honored to be selected by DiversityInc as one of the Top 50 Companies for Diversity, the Human Rights Campaign rated us at 100 percent on their Corporate Equality Index, and Professional Woman’s Magazine named us as a Top Diversity Employer of Women. We were also chosen by the Pax Ellevate Global Women's Index Fund for being one of the highest-rated companies in the world for advancing women leadership. Additionally, we are committed to offering family-focused benefits across our hotels and offices, including our industry-leading maternity leave policy, flexible working environments, 10-day advanced scheduling, paid time off, and educational assistance. IBM: In 1935, IBM founder Thomas J. Watson Sr. said, "Men and women will do the same kind of work for equal pay. They will have the same treatment, the same responsibilities and the same opportunities for advancement." IBM established a broad equal opportunity policy more than a decade before the Civil Rights Act, and we have maintained and continually improved a formal pay analysis and adjustment process for women and minority employees for 40 years. And now, in IBM’s second century as a company, we remain firmly dedicated to providing fair pay based on job responsibilities and performance, which is critical to meeting today’s evolving business and technology challenges. IBM is proud to sign the White House’s Equal Pay pledge as another step in our long history of fostering fairness, diversity and inclusion in the workplace. IKEA US: IKEA is a values-driven company, and our approach to diversity and inclusion is grounded in our values. We believe in people and see each individual as a talent. We treat each other fairly and provide our co-workers with equal opportunities, regardless of their gender identity, age, sexual orientation, physical ability, ethnicity, race, nationality, or any other dimension of their identity. We know that each individual adds value to the team, and we are committed to creating an inclusive work environment that encourages our diverse and competent co-workers to be themselves, to apply their unique perspectives at work, and to assume responsibility for our growth. In addition to being the right thing to do, creating this environment also improves our business results and strengthens our competitiveness. Several years ago, IKEA launched a proactive global effort to increase the diversity of our workforce at all levels. As part of this, we took – and will continue to take – a hard look at all areas of gender equality, including workforce representation, hiring, career development, succession planning, promotion rates, and pay equity. Over the coming years, we will maintain a comprehensive approach to diversity and inclusion across the entire organization, including pay equality. We are proud to take the Equal Pay Pledge to ensure fairness for all our co-workers, and to join the many companies contributing to a better society by leading on this issue. Intel: Signing the Equal Pay Pledge for Intel is a natural extension of our longstanding commitment to paying our employees fairly and equitably at all levels of the organization. We hold ourselves accountable with data by conducting an annual, comprehensive audit of pay in the U.S. to analyze our employees' pay by gender and ethnicity. In 2015 we conducted a comprehensive compensation analysis examining gender pay parity for U.S. employees across job types and levels. The report showed a net result of 100% pay parity, and we're incredibly proud of this result. Our commitment to diversity comes from our conviction that reaching a critical mass of women and underrepresented minorities in our industry brings ample benefits to many. The Libra Group: The Libra Group heartily supports the Equal Pay Pledge. As an employer we are age, sex, orientation, race and religion blind. Yet we are acutely aware that the wage gap is very often a symptom of a broader opportunity gap that may affect some population groups more than others, notably women. So wage parity begins with opportunity parity, which is why so many of our group’s social responsibility programs focus on groups who are experiencing disproportionate lack of educational and career opportunity. In many cases this means providing work experience, or equipping under-served communities with the advice, mentoring, training and support they need to acquire leadership skills or get a new business off the ground. For the fortunate few we are able to break the cycle of disadvantage and give a helping hand – but there is still more to be done. In our experience tomorrow’s leaders emerge from the most unlikely places. Thus we believe that narrowing the pay gap depends on two things: a culture of equal opportunity and equal treatment within the work environment, combined with selective positive action and intervention to lift people out of endemic disadvantage and give them the chance they deserve. LinkedIn: LinkedIn's vision is to create economic opportunity for every member of the global workforce. We are committed to ensuring all of our employees have equal opportunities to succeed and be recognized for their accomplishments. At the core of economic opportunity is equal pay for equal work. We believe it is basic good business to ensure this is true within your own organization, and we regularly review and evaluate our pay practices to ensure our employees are compensated fairly. In addition, our ongoing focus on improving the gender diversity of our employee base continues to have meaningful impact with gains in women's representation in both technical and leadership roles over the last several years. The Women’s Initiative (WIN) within our Global Sales team and the Women in Technology initiative (WIT) within our Engineering and Product organizations have built a framework to successfully hire, retain, develop and advance women. We are committed to continuing to create diverse teams in an inclusive work environment where every person feels they truly belong and are paid fairly. MailChimp: Equal pay is an essential part of MailChimp’s culture of inclusion, and we’re grateful for the opportunity to sign the White House Equal Pay Pledge. We conduct annual pay and benefits analyses, in addition to focusing on fair hiring and interviewing practices, generous family leave policies, flexible work schedules, employee-led resource groups, leadership development opportunities for employees at every level, and meaningful corporate citizenship programs. It is unacceptable that women working full-time earn only 79 percent of what men earn, and unacceptable that the gap is even greater for women of color. MailChimp promises to do our part to close that gap. We are committed to empowering all of our employees and helping them succeed both within our organization and out in the world. Microsoft: Microsoft is proud to join others in the effort to drive greater pay equality among men and women, which is a critical component of social progress.  When women are fully engaged in our workforce and communities, society at large benefits from the great ideas and innovation that flourishes.  Our commitment to equal pay gives us the opportunity to attract and hire from a broader talent pool of the best employees, managers and leaders—while gaining important insights into consumers’ needs. In addition to gender pay equality, we are also committed to ensuring that all employees have equal opportunity. MuleSoft: MuleSoft has signed the Equal Pay Pledge as a testament to our continued commitment to creating a great place to work for everyone. MuleSoft has a long-standing commitment to equal opportunity, and we believe people should be paid equally for equal work and experience. We conduct an annual audit of our compensation, which we readily use to influence changes in our policies. Ensuring that we all have the same platform for opportunities, growth, and compensation is core to our ethos and success. We’re committed to providing a workplace where everyone is supported and inspired by the opportunity to build a successful company where we can do what we love and thrive. Nike: Today, we are proud to sign the White House Equal Pay Pledge. At Nike, diversity is about acknowledging and valuing our differences and appreciating that everyone brings unique experiences, perspectives and ideas to the team. Investing in our employees to unleash their potential translates into a pipeline of new ideas, methods, and products that drive the future of sport. In keeping with our culture and what we stand for as an organization, we remain committed to equitable pay and rewarding performance across all roles, for all Nike team members. By signing the White House Equal Pay Pledge, we’re adding our voice to a movement that we hope will inspire positive change. Patagonia: Since they founded Patagonia in a small Tin Shed more than 40 years ago, Yvon and Malinda Chouinard have worked hard to build a culture where women and families thrive. Today, Patagonia continues to value and honor our working women with equal pay and opportunity. We believe women shouldn’t have to make the unnecessary choice between family and career and they can grow a career at the same pace as a family. At Patagonia, thanks to onsite child care, nursing moms are a few feet away from their babies versus miles apart. New moms and dads take paid time off to bond with and care for infants and families can eat breakfast and lunch together daily. We have an equal number of women and men at every level of the company, including among executive positions and the boardroom. Women and men are paid equally for comparable work. All of these things amount to a work environment where 100 percent of women return to work from maternity leave, 100 percent of dads take paid time off from work to bond with their new babies, and the business thrives as a result of the working families we support in our business. We also believe that there is so much more to be done to reinforce the true drivers of pay equality – such as paid maternity and paternity leave, quality on-site childcare, and a family-supportive work environment – which allow working moms and dads to continue to grow their family, career and income with equal opportunity. Patagonia commits to continuing to build on the progress we’ve made and supporting working families through every avenue possible as we continue to grow our business in line with the values we were founded on. “Women will never be able to effectively “lean in” without the proper economic, social and community support for the most critical work of all: raising children.” -Rose Marcario – CEO, Patagonia Target: At Target, we believe diversity and inclusivity make teams and Target better. We work to create a diverse and inclusive working environment and cultivate an inclusive guest experience, building a better Target for our team members and guests – and a better society for all. Target is honored to sign the White House Equal Pay Pledge and affirm our commitment to making pay equitable for everyone at Target, including women in the workplace. To achieve our goal of pay equity, we’ve implemented meaningful business practices, including continued leadership training designed, in part, to reduce the likelihood that leaders’ decisions are improperly influenced by bias or stereotyping.  We also use other internal measures, such as a comprehensive annual pay audit process, to ensure compensation is fair and equitable across the organization. Additionally, earlier this year, Target CEO Brian Cornell joined PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi to co-chair the Network of Executive Women’s Future Fund – an industry-wide campaign aimed at achieving 50/50 gender parity in the workforce. We’ve also earned a spot on the list for the Top Companies for Executive Women from the National Association for Female Executives for the past four years. We are proud of our internal initiatives and external partnerships, and we remain committed to improving pay processes and policies that ensure equality and fairness for all. Unilever: At Unilever, we strive to create a bright future and believe business has a critical part to play in closing the national gender gap. As part of our Unilever Sustainable Living Plan - which is our blueprint to grow our business, while decoupling our environmental footprint from our growth and increasing our positive social impact - we have the ambition to empower the lives of five million women by 2020. Unilever is in a strong position to help empower women around the world: over 70% of our consumers are women and they play essential roles in our value chain. Unilever is proud to take the Equal Pay Pledge and confirm our commitment to gender equality. We consider the advancement of women’s economic inclusion a business priority and by promoting the formal and active participation of women in the economy—we aim to transform lives, families, communities and economies and in turn, have the opportunity to grow our markets, brands and business. Over the past six years, Unilever has been in the process of making sure we have gender balance throughout our business. We are currently at 49% gender balance for managers and above in North America and continue to strive to foster an environment where each individual feels uniquely valued and has equal opportunities.  Unilever is committed to creating a working environment that promotes diversity and equal opportunity. We are proud to have developed an inclusive culture and respect the contribution of all employees regardless of gender, age, race, disability or sexual orientation.  Visa: Universal acceptance for everyone, everywhere is not only our brand promise, it’s the foundation of our company culture. Diversity and inclusion is a strategic imperative at Visa, and it requires equal pay for equal work. We regularly review our compensation practices and conduct thorough analyses to ensure pay equity. An inclusive workplace enhances and enriches our environment, successfully drives business results and leads to improved leadership effectiveness and employee engagement. We will continue to take meaningful steps to make progress in this important journey. And we’re proud to sign this pledge as way of affirming our commitment to pay equity for our female employees in the U.S. Prev Next You are here:   Home News National News White House Announces New Commitments to the Equal Pay Pledge Main Menu Imperial Valley News News Latest News Imperial Valley News California News National News Health News Sporting News Living and Lifestyle Career News World News Spanish - Espanol About Us Copyright Infringements Privacy Policy Contact Us Sitemap Web Links Latest News Women's Wellness: Having a heart attack The link between diabetes and pancreatic cancer Principles of healthy eating Functional fitness training: Is it right for you?

MacMall Part #: 13696634 Manufacturer Part #: MK0C2AM/A UPC: 888462313674 Platform: Universal Apple Pencil MK0C2AM/A for iPad Pro By now, you've probably heard of how great the iPad Pro is and you know all about its awesome features and so much more. If you already thought that the iPad Pro couldn't get any cooler, then you are wrong because with the Apple Pencil, using the iPad Pro has just become a lot easier and more fun. Precision is everything especially for artists who want their works to be the reflection of their abilities. Create art and so much more on the iPad Pro with precision when you use the iPad Pro Pencil. See for yourself just how effective a tool it really is. The iPad Pencil helps to expand the versatility of the Multi-Touch. It has been designed and engineered to look and feel natural in your hand. So you can create, write, and do so much more with the familiar feel of a pen in your hand. You're probably thinking that the Apple Pencil is just a glorified stylus, but it's not. A lot of engineering went into the making of this pencil, and it features a highly responsive tip that lets any user feel in control of their creations. The secret behind this responsiveness is that the Apple Pencil's latency (the delay between drawing and it appearing on screen) is greatly reduced compared to a regular stylus, giving the user a more enjoyable and natural feel when sketching. Another feature you don't get with a regular stylus is that the iPad Pencil has pressure sensors that can measure the different range of forces. This allows the artist to draw thicker lines just by applying more pressure to the pen. The creativity effects when using the iPad Pro Pencil are limitless and each user can do just about anything they want when they use the iPad Pencil. So what are you waiting for? Get into the future and start using a stylus that is more than a regular stylus. Shop at MacMall today and order your very own Apple Pencil. Also available, Apple iPad Pro Wi-Fi 32GB - Silver. The new Multi-Touch subsystem in iPad Pro gives Apple Pencil striking capabilities alongside pixel-perfect precision Using incredibly sensitive pressure and tilt sensors, Apple Pencil instantly recognizes when you are pressing harder or shifting its angle. So you can vary line weight, create subtle shading, and produce a wide range of artistic effects—just like with a conventional pencil. You may never have seen Apple Pencil before, but you already know how to use it. From the first moment, it does what you expect. And then far more. Whether you’re sketching in the park, painting a watercolor portrait, or drafting a blueprint, Apple Pencil gives you a variety of tools in a single instrument. You hold it, but it doesn’t hold you back. Slip off the magnetic cap of Apple Pencil to reveal a Lightning connector that lets you charge Apple Pencil simply by plugging it into iPad Pro. The connector features a slightly elongated design, so that charging is possible even when iPad Pro is inside its Silicone Case. A full charge gives you 12 hours’ worth of scribbling, sketching, annotating, and editing. And if the battery happens to run out while using Apple Pencil, you can just charge it from your iPad Pro for 15 seconds and get 30 minutes of use.

Was this helpful? Yes|No I placed my order for the Apple Pencil the day that they became available (or, at least, available for to place a pre-order order) from MacMall. Each time that my salesperson contacted me and asked if I wanted to cancel the order for the Pencil, I just said no, that I could wait.<br><br>And so I waited. And it arrived yesterday. And, my, oh, my, is it a thing of beauty. Or, rather I should say, beautiful things can come forth from it.<br><br>For those who can actually draw (not my fortÃ©) the Apple Pencil may be more than just a new tool with a new media for the masses. I can only guess at the possibilities that may be envisioned. But for even retouching schmucks like me I see a new creativity that may emerge... not just a replication of techniques and media (turning a photo into a digital watercolour is getting old hat), but something new. And beautiful. Something never imagined. <br><br>The Apple Pencil, well, looks like a slightly elongated white Pencil. It's heavier. Drop a dot of watercolour on a dampened paper and the colour spreads. Digital canvases with permanent content until you press a button and you've a blank sheet of 'paper.' As they have for decades, Apple hands us the ingredients -----&#62;&#62; now it's up to us to decide how to put it all together. Maybe there's time for me to become an amateur artist after all.<br><br> Written by Clinton, 2016-01-07 MacMall offers next day delivery on select products when you choose them before the stated deadline and use FedEx Standard Overnight, Priority or Saturday delivery.

Let's get it on! 0 shares Share on FacebookShare on TwitterPost on  RedditShare by Email   Transcript: Apple iPhone 4S vs. Samsung Galaxy Nexus (Sprint) What's up price -- fans I'm Brian Tong and this is an epic battle between two of the big boys in the Smartphone world. There's a prize fight punch out between Apple's iPhone for -- and the Samsung Galaxy Nexus on -- Our judges for this fight are senior editor Brian boom boom -- Senior editor Jessica duke it out old port and myself really think all.

Now the Samsung Galaxy Nexus brings a four point 65 inch super amoled display that pops with vibrant color and a curved glass design. It's -- to hold but it's also one of the few big screen phones that fits in my pocket nicely. The phone has a textured plastic backing that may not feel as premium but we drop it it has more than a chance to survive. Beauty is in the avenue boulder and -- calling this round a tie at four next round is user interface and control.

But even my unborn child continues over time they've added features like -- axis of the camera a customizable notifications drop down and Syria is just one button press away.

No Thanks Yes Please Home «Back Spotify reacts against Apple's exclusive artists Bloomberg |  Aug 27, 2016 09:14 PM IST An escalating battle between Apple and Spotify is leaving some musicians caught in the crossfire. Spotify has been retaliating against musicians who introduce new music exclusively on rival Apple Music by making their songs harder to find, according to people familiar with the strategy. Artists who have given Apple exclusive access to new music have been told they won't be able to get their tracks on featured playlists once the songs become available on Spotify, said the people, who declined to be identified discussing the steps......

Apple undoubtedly has one of the most top-grade security systems for its iPhones; even experts working for the government have failed to crack the device. However, it seems like the company is not satisfied and wants to beef up encryption a bit more. A recently published patent application by the US Patent and Trademark Office explains a system to capture video, audio and even fingerprints of anyone trying to hack into any iDevice. Dubbed “Biometric Capture for Unauthorized User Identification,” the background of this patent suggests how a user’s computing devices such as laptops, smartphones, tablets and music players contain a lot of personal information. Apple is well-aware of the problems a user has to go through if this type of data falls into the wrong hands and that’s why it wants to beef up security on its devices even further. Several ways to protect these computing devices already exist, such as passcodes and fingerprint scanners. Apple also has “Find My iPhone” app, which helps users erase all the data before a thief gains access to their device. However, it seems that the company is still not satisfied and wants to come up with a hack-proof system. Therefore, Apple is working on a system which will not just protect data on a device but also help track the thieves/hackers. If the tech giant does come up with such a system, it’ll most likely discourage thieves from stealing an Apple device. The method explained within the document for integrating this feature seems to be easy as the components required for this are already present in iPhones and iPads. Moreover, as mentioned before, this feature can either use biometric data, video, audio or all of them to identify unauthorized users. However, the device will obtain this data on a given number of wrong attempts, as some leeway for mistakes are provided to the owner of the device. Once the number of tries to login on a particular device exceeds the allowed limit, the feature will immediately activate, record and send the data to the concerned authorities. It should be noted that several similar applications already exist in the market, however, they are only available on Cydia — the app directory for jail broken iOS devices. Moreover, these apps only take pictures using the front camera and email it to the user but they don’t extract biometric data, video or audio. Similar apps also exist on Android devices and are not even required to be rooted. Apple may have been late again at getting a feature on its device, but we believe it seems to be more productive than the ones that already exist. The iPhone maker might not have to do much in extraction of data required for this technology, as this technology seems to be more dependent on software than hardware. However, the quality of the front camera and microphone might have to be improved in order to obtain accurate results. Lastly, the tech giant hasn’t confirmed which devices will have this feature. We might just see it on Apple devices releasing in 2017. However, since it’s just a patent, there is a possibility that we might never even see this feature on any Apple devices.

(Photo : Photo by Stephen Lam/ Getty Images) On Thursday, August 25, Apple published a new patent application that suggests the high-tech company will incorporate anti-theft technology in its future iPhones.  Future iPhones Will Collect Thief's Biometric Data According to Apple's new patent application, the company is interested to implement in its future iPhones an anti-theft measure that will capture covertly both a fingerprint and a photo of a phone thief. Some version of the technology presented in the patent application might go into future iPads and iPhones. The Verge reports that Apple's patent application imagines a system that will capture biometric data of the person holding the iPhone when a "trigger condition" is present. Among the trigger conditions could be the detection of an unauthorized user attempting to bypass the iPhone's security features or an unauthorized access coming from a third-party device. This biometric information may include one or more images of the current iPhone user, one or more fingerprints, audio of the environment, video of the current user, forensic interface use information and more, according to details provided by the patent abstract. According to Apple Insider, the unauthorized user's data could be sent to a remote server for further analysis or stored locally on the device. The stored biometric information may used then for identification of the unauthorized user. Legal Issues Involved In Capturing Biometric Data There are some technical and legal issues challenging Apple's idea. Capturing a phone thief's biometric data like fingerprints and photos raises some privacy and legal red flags. Even if it is a feature designed for consumers protection, covertly capturing and storing biometric information could tarnish Apple's reputation with regards to user privacy. Apple used to brag about its decision to not store any unencrypted information. Apple CEO Tim Cook has routinely used the company's record on privacy to present in a favorable light Apple hardware and software. The company did not take any steps back on the user privacy issues even when confronted with FBI investigations. Such an anti-theft system might be unprecedented. From a technical perspective, Apple's TouchID fingerprint-reading technology implemented in iPhones today requires that users hold down their finger in a variety of angles and numerous times to accurately capture the print. If the company plans to introduce such an anti-theft system future versions of Apple's fingerprint scanners and Touch ID will need to be able to collect fingerprints in a more efficient manner.

MenuHome News Home News News Apple Thief Prevention Answer Is At The Tip Your Fingers By Staff Reporter | August 26, 2016 Share Tweet Share Share 0 comments If you have misplaced your Apple iPhone or lost it, Apple will allow you to remotely locate or wipe out the details on your device but that is not enough now as Apple will be working to also identify the thief at the same time. Since all the new Apple iPhone will not come with a fingerprint sensor, Apple is thinking about using the Touch ID sensor on the Apple iPhone to record the fingerprints when the device is reported to be lost. That means if somebody stole the iPhone tried opening it up with the home button, the device will record their fingerprint and send it to the authority. In the new patent files, it also suggests that Apple might take it a little further and actually record and the voice or snap a picture of the thief. We don’t know if Apple will get around release this new safety system but it is clear that Apple is still working on making their smartphone more secure.

By Edelweiss Snow, Parent Herald August 26, 01:00 pm TAG Apple Watch, Apple Watch 2, apple, iPhone 7, samsung gear s3 Ever since rumors about the Apple Watch 2 release date surfaced online, tech junkies around the globe have flocked the internet for more information on Apple's newest wearable device. Not a lot has been disclosed about the new gadget, but several tech insiders have already dished on the new smartwatch this early. Despite no word from the Cupertino-based tech giant, several Apple Watch 2 release date rumors seem to hint that the new watch will boast of some noteworthy features. Some previous reports have even claimed that this could be Apple's beacon of light since most loyal Apple consumers are not sure whether the iPhone 7 will be a good buy. Several tech sites and blogs have suggested that the new Apple Watch 2 will be an independent device compared to its predecessor. According to Vine Report, Apple is expected to showcase more upgrades and improvements on the new smartwatch, but users should not expect a different look and feel to it. Some of the rumored upgrades for the new Apple Watch reportedly involves features that will make it a stand-alone gadget. Should Apple pursue this path, fans should expect a SIM card slot on their wearable devices as this will be crucial in making the Apple Watch 2 independent from the iPhone. Meanwhile, the Apple Watch 2 might have some serious competition when the Samsung Gear S3 gets released. According to Mobile & Apps, the android wearable device that could be available next month also boasts of notable improvements including a doubled battery capacity.

News Tonight Africa Home Health Mobiles Science Apple CEO Tim Cook sold $36M worth of company stock this week Submitted by Sonwabile Makoni on Sat, 08/27/2016 - 10:12 A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Friday has revealed that Apple CEO Tim Cook has collected $36 million in stock sale. The filing said that Cook – who completed his fifth anniversary as the Apple CEO on Wednesday, August 24 – sold $36 million worth of the Apple stock, close on the heels of lifting the restrictions on 1.26 million shares of stock which he had been previously awarded. According to the SEC filing, more than 656,000 shares have been withheld by Apple to meet tax withholding requirements, while Cook netted approximately $36 million by selling 334,000 shares on the open market this week. The filing has revealed that the Apple shares sold by Cook hit the market on Thursday and Friday, at prices which ranged between a low and high of $106.54 and $107.92 respectively. Meanwhile, as a result of the sale of Apple stock by Cook, 1.31 million shares -- including some earlier Apple stock holdings -- worth nearly $140 million were left with the high-profile Apple executive at closing price on Friday. In the coming years, Cook will also likely collect another 3.5 million shares which are still under restrictions.

Trident is used in spyware referred to as Pegasus, which a Citizen Lab investigation showed was made by an Israel-based organization called NSO Group. It was acquired by the U.S. firm Francisco Partners Management six years ago, according to Lookout and Citizen. Lookout referred to Pegasus as the most sophisticated attack it has ever seen, sneakily accessing calls, cameras, email, passwords, apps and more on iPhones. The spyware was detected when used against Ahmed Mansoor, a human rights activist in the United Arab Emirates, who has been repeatedly targeted using spyware. Phishing Scheme After receiving a suspicious text with a link, he reported the matter to Citizen Lab, which worked in conjunction with San Francisco-based Lookout to research the affair. “The attack sequence, boiled down, is a classic phishing scheme: send text message, open web browser, load page, exploit vulnerabilities, install persistent software to gather information,” the joint blog post said. “This, however, happens invisibly and silently, such that victims do not know they've been compromised.” Mansoor received text messages on Aug. 10 and 11 promising that secrets about detainees being tortured in UAE jails could be accessed by clicking on an enclosed link, researchers said. Had he fallen for the ruse, the Trident chain of “zero-day exploits” would have broken into his iPhone and installed snooping software. Once infected, Mansoor's iPhone would have been turned into a “spy in his pocket” capable of tracking his whereabouts and conversations, Citizen Lab said. Mansoor was targeted five years ago with FinFisher spyware and again the following year with Hacking Team spyware, according to Citizen Lab research. “The use of such expensive tools against Mansoor shows the lengths that governments are willing to go to target activists,” the researchers said. Although the cyberattack on Mansoor was not linked to a specific government, Citizen Lab said indicators pointed to the UAE. UAE authorities did not comment on the matter. Lookout and Citizen believe the spyware has been “in the wild for a significant amount of time.” “It is also being used to attack high-value targets for multiple purposes, including high-level corporate espionage on iOS, Android and Blackberry.” Citizen Lab has also found evidence that “state-sponsored actors” used NSO weapons against a Mexican journalist who reported on high-level corruption in that country and on an unknown target in Kenya. The NSO tactics included impersonating sites such as the International Committee of the Red Cross, the British government's visa application processing website, and a wide range of news organizations and major technology companies, the researchers said.

We’ve seen tons of small MFi keychain chargers and tiny USB battery packs but this is the first time, to my knowledge, that a battery is actually included into a Apple Certified MFi cable. This week, I took the $16 (after code JCRJEWEL) Jackery Jewel for a spin. The idea is pretty simple: Jackery put a 450mAh battery right in the cable.  Now the 450mAh isn’t going to give you a full charge even on an iPhone SE. In fact, in my usage, 25% was a stretch. That’s because the battery, roughly the size and Watt-hour capacity of a AA battery, has about a third the of the iPhone SE and 1/5th the capacity of an iPhone 6S plus. There’s also some inefficiencies of transferring the power. The Jewel isn’t meant to be a full battery replacement however. This is meant to give you an emergency few hour boost when you are away from a plug. We’re talking emergencies here. In real world usage this worked pretty much as expected. It functions as a normal Lightning cable when plugged into a Mac or PC. Data transfer happens like you’d expect and I didn’t notice any lag. If you use your iPhone while plugged in, the battery dangling is a slight inconvenience – I would have probably located the battery closer to the USB A side if I was designing this – but a minor gripe overall. The cable is strong and the joints are at least as strong as Apple’s cables – yes I know Apple has a reputation for fraying cables but if you use them as a baseline, these are certainly stronger. They come with an 18 month warranty which is longer than Apple’s default year warranty. If the Jewel is unplugged and being powered from the battery, it only draws 1A of power and that takes about 25 minutes to drain into the iPhone. However if plugged into a 2.4A USB port it will take the full power and fast charge. IT obviously also charges iPod Touch, iPad and anything else that uses lightning – like Beats speakers and headphones or an Apple TV remote. Also I noted that once plugged back in after running to dead, it took a few seconds for the cable to start charging again. There are definitely some electronic things happening in there. There really isn’t much of a status indicator on the Jewel:  Blue for charged and a blinking red LED for “you are in trouble or almost dead”- if the red light is flashing, the power draw starts dropping to 0 amps. Initially, I thought that the button that you must push to charge using the battery was superfluous but you really want to save that extra battery power for emergencies not just use it right after unplugging the cable. Also, because it is a cable, it is always being charged and ready for that emergancy. I have about 10 USB batteries but I almost always forget to charge them up for emergencies. I wouldn’t recommend something this mAh size for iPads. It will only give you an extra few minutes of usage. However, for $3 less than Apple charges for a Lightning cable, Jackery is selling an Apple certified MFi replacement that includes a working 450mAh battery? Seems like a no brainer. $15.99 (after code JCRJEWEL) We’ll also be giving one of these away as part of our upcoming 9to5Rewards program for someone who retweets or likes the post on Facebook.

As far back as the 1930s, drivers were listening to AM radio on the first Motorola in-dash units. As the 20th century progressed, so did our in-vehicle technology. We went from AM to FM radio, in-dash record players, cassettes, the 8-track tape, and the compact disc. The iPod came along in 2001, and so did a proliferation of Aux-in jacks for them to connect to. Now we had a thousand songs in our pocket and our car. Of course, like all the other technology before it, the iPod was soon obsolete, replaced by the smartphone. It used to be that turning on the radio was an exciting experience. You never knew what song would be playing, nor when your favorite tune would come on. But this is a worry no longer, thanks to on-demand music streaming services like Spotify or Apple Music. Except for one thing. Our damn iPhones seem to play the same damn song every time we plug them in. It turns out that the iPhone, for whatever reason, decides to play the first song it can find when plugging into a vehicle USB port or connecting via Bluetooth. And it’s always the first song alphabetically. And no matter how good that song is, eventually, after you hear the first few seconds of it over and over and over and over every time you start your car… well, eventually it’s enough to ruin even the most catchy tune. We decided to poll The Verge staff, assemble these various songs (most, unsurprisingly, with titles starting with the letter A) and share a little bit about what they mean to us. Have a look, listen, and let us know what song your iPhone decides to play when you go for a ride. And please, Apple, can we get this fixed in iOS 11? — Jordan Golson "Accidentally Like A Martyr" by Warren Zevon I mostly use streaming services these days, so my iTunes library is almost totally old favorite albums that I listen to when I’m out of service areas or on planes. Zevon, obviously, falls into that category — and I have a ton of him on iTunes because I haven’t figured out how to reasonably integrate all his bootlegs with my streaming services. So the song is, as the kids say, very on-brand. Unfortunately, it’s not top-shelf Zevon, and it’s a hella bummer of a song. If I’m feeling blue, I’ll let it play out, but more often than not, I skip it (by opening Spotify or Tidal), There are only so many times you can hear "The hurt gets worse and the heart gets harder." — Liz Lopatto "A Beginning Song" by The Decemberists The song that’s at the top of my iTunes library is "A Beginning Song" off The Decemberists’ latest album, What a Terrible World, What a Beautiful World. I’ve had an on-again / off-again relationship with the band since college. I was never a huge fan of their earlier works, but I’ve really liked the direction that they’ve gone in albums like The Crane Wife, The King Is Dead and this one. For me, "A Beginning Song" is the perfect sort of driving song. It’s got a relaxed beat and solid vocals that make it perfect for driving up rural Vermont roads with the windows down. Fortunately, there’s rarely anyone around to hear me singing along. — Andrew Liptak "The A Team" by Ed Sheeran Like Liz, I use another streaming service for my music fix these days, but Apple has managed to muscle its way into my car, which means that when I plug my iPhone into the dashboard mount it still defaults to iTunes. Most of my car rides over the past few years have started off on a rather depressing note with Ed Sheeran’s breakout hit "The A Team." Makes sense; the song literally starts with "A." If I’m in a certain mindset, I’ll listen to it again. It’s a sad song, about a meth-addled prostitute ("Call girl, no phone"); it was reportedly based on Sheeran's experience playing a gig at a homeless shelter. If there’s anything that could be said in defense of the song it’s probably that it’s Sheeran at his purist — long before he did a duet with Taylor Swift or wrote a de facto wedding song. Most days, though, I quickly shuffle the music, and if someone else is in the car and hears "The A Team" I usually feel the need to explain that it’s iTunes that has programmed the mood. — Lauren Goode "About To Die" by Dirty Projectors The other day, my wife and I got into our 2013 Subaru Impreza. As usual, I plugged in my iPhone, but before my wife could shout "No not that song again!" that song started playing… again. The song that always plays every time I plug my phone in, because it is the first track on the only album I have in my iTunes library. Unfailingly, the loopy percussion of "About To Die" by Dirty Projectors hits my car’s speakers before my finger can swipe up my phone’s control panel to pause the track. It’s not a bad song. In fact, it is a very good song. It used to be one of my favorites off the band’s 2012 masterpiece, Swing Lo Magellan. But because it now plays totally unprompted every time I plug my phone into my car, it has become that song: the song that plays itself, the song that never asked to be played. Maybe it’s appropriate. Despite its poppy, off-kilter beat and infectious vocals, the song’s lyrics are very bleak, full of emptiness and panic about imminent death. That’s reflected in my own personal panic that I feel every time the song cues up. I fear the song. I fear death. And while we’re all about to die, maybe we don’t listen to that particular song a gazillion times in a row, thus ruining it forever for certain people, hmmm Apple? — Andrew J. Hawkins "About Face" by Grizzly Bear I only have four albums on Apple Music, and I can’t remember how or why they got there. There are the soundtracks for Once and The Wind Rises, Guillemots Through the Windowpane, and Grizzly Bear’s Veckatimest (the latter of which is responsible for my garage goodbye song). "About Face" is as fine a song as any, I suppose, to start every single trip every single day. Though over the past year of becoming intimately familiar with its first 10 seconds — I only began driving again last May, so I guess you could say my relationship with "About Face" is just beginning to bloom — I’ve realized the song’s true calling: to be a ringtone. The repeated progression of carefully plucked notes interrupted by a distorted gnh-gnh is the perfect balance of pleasing and grating that a ringtone requires. You won’t mind hearing the beginning of "About Face" over and over again, no, not at all, but each double-screech will shout from your smartphone, like Linda Loman letting you know attention must be paid to this call from your parents at 3PM on a Saturday. Frankly, "About Face" is wasted as my autoplay car song, where at best it evokes a semi-smile, and at worst it is ignored as I scramble to open Spotify. — Chris Plante "A$AP Rocky x Purity Ring (Pesobedear)" by the Hood Internet Every once in a while, I click my earbuds to resume a podcast, and instead my iPhone plays the first track in Apple Music: a mashup of A$AP Rocky’s "Peso" with Purity Ring’s "Obedear." I wasn’t previously familiar with "Peso," a hazy ode to the hustle, but "Obedear" I have long loved for its inscrutable creepiness. In the hands of the Hood Internet, whose annual mixtapes are a cherished staple of my gym playlist, the artists make for a potent combination. Rocky’s lyric floats over Purity Ring’s darkly shimmering synths, and a noticeable swagger creeps into my stride. At least until I remember I was trying to listen to a podcast, and pause the track again. — Casey Newton "A-Plus" by Hieroglyphics I usually connect my phone to the car via Bluetooth, which means my radio is pretty good about respecting what’s happening in Spotify, but every now and then I plug into USB to charge, and my car is instantly transported back to 2003. 2003, when any music player plugged into a car was an IPOD rendered in all capital letters. 2003, five years after Del tha Funkee Homosapien and his crew formed Hieroglyphics and put out 3rd Eye Vision. 2003, when loading your IPOD with critically beloved indie rap albums actually implied that you might listen to those records instead of just adding them to your Spotify lists like so much more identity curation on a social platform. 2003, when my friends turned me onto Del and I loaded 3rd Eye Vision on my IPOD and actually listened to it all the time, along with all the other new music I consumed as complete albums instead of biting off singles on Discover Weekly with no relationship to anyone or anything or any art in particular. Goddamn I miss 2003. — Nilay Patel "A/B Machines" by Sleigh Bells Everybody gets in the car with a tiny little ritual: sit down, adjust seat, plug phone, shift, pause, check mirrors, etc. And though it doesn’t happen every time, sometimes CarPlay does decide it’s time to just start playing the first song in Apple Music. And for me, that song is "A/B Machines" from Sleigh Bells’ Treats album. So in at least this one, tiny way, I can claim to have been cool, once. Adjust the mirror a little further, look into your own eyes as the distorted lyrics blast out. Yes, it’s true, you had it once. Maybe you’re faded now, but you can get it back. Shift into gear, drive. Your A machines are on the table. Turn them up. — Dieter Bohn Next Up In Transportation The Second Avenue Subway is finally open, and people are flipping out Google and Chrysler use Android to revamp the in-car touchscreen Tesla extends unlimited free supercharging incentive through mid-January In 2017 cars are at the frontier of technology Will 2017 be the year we hail a flying Uber? 2017 will be an important year for personal electric vehicles of all sizes Now Trending CES 2017: What to expect at the biggest tech trade show of the year Olympus E-M1 Mark II review: the camera that warps time The Kissenger simulates kissing your long-distance lover Dell has turned one of the best Windows laptops into a 2-in-1 hybrid Donald Trump says 'no computer is safe' This Article has a component height of 54.

Cloud music storage services can help – and there’s a lot out there. Here are some of the best cloud storage solutions for your songs: Don’t worry, they’re all free to use, too!   1. Google Play Out of the major brands, Google Play offers one of the most versatile free cloud storage for music. With Google Play you can upload up to 50,000 songs from your computer to the Play cloud servers – and that includes music from other sources including iTunes. You do this through the Music Manager app that Google offers, which can successfully save your songs, playlists, and ratings. Then you can access that music through Google Play via any Android platform or the Web itself. You can download Google Play for free here   2. iCloud iCloud on its own is a fair free cloud music storage service for moving your music around. You may not be surprised to learn that it is limited to music that you buy from the iTunes Store, but within that framework iCloud is a solid service for transferring songs between your Apple devices (it also works for the newer Windows devices). The automatic syncing functions mean that you don’t have to worry your new music showing up on your iPhone or iPad once you buy it. However, the true music storage service of Apple’s is iTunes Match, which allows you to store music in the Apple cloud from any source and also ties into ad-free iTunes Radio. Unfortunately, there’s no free options here (yet), you’ll have to pay a couple bucks a month to use it. You can learn how to set up iCloud here   3. Amazon Cloud Player Amazon Cloud Player is a somewhat less useful cloud storage option, not because of its lack of features but because the best features are available when you upgrade to Premium, which of course costs money. However, the basic service still allows you more than a couple hundred free uploads worth of free storage, and is dedicated to music with a focus on Amazon Music services. However, there are Cloud Player apps available across the major platforms with plenty of flexible curation options, so you still retain a lot of control…providing you like Amazon services in the first place, of course. You can download Amazon Cloud Player here   4. Synology Audio Station Synology’s cloud storage offering is a little…different. First, the service and its associated programs are definitely free, and they offer unlimited micromanagement of your songs in what is one of the best cloud music storage options available. The downside is that they are only available through a Synology server device, which you already need to have (or at least have access to). But if the conditions are right, you probably won’t find better customization options around after installing the various DiskStation Manager and Audio station programs. There are options to download music for iTunes, etc., but as the tutorials show Synology is typically used in a Windows environment. You can learn more about downloading Synology Audio Station here   5. StreamNation StreamNation is a relatively recent addition the media storage service world, and it has some of the best cloud storage for music around. The app offers one-click imports of music libraries like iTunes, and allows to stream to any other device you want. It can then use music to recommend new songs in the genres that you like or show you what your friends are listening to. The interface also impresses with its flowing, album covered-based design. There are several different plans to choose from, but the free version gives you 20GB of data, not too shabby at all. You can get started with the StreamNation service here   6. My Music Cloud My Music Cloud is a simpler service than many on the list, but that simplicity is part of its charm. Like StreamNation, the service offers one-click importing from iTunes, Dropbox, etc., but there’s much more of a focus on streaming services (plus some capabilities to listen offline). Like Spotify and other apps, My Music Cloud can learn your preferences by seeing what music you play and suggest similar artists or remind you of uploaded songs that you haven’t listened to in a while yet. Storage, however, is a little limited with the free version offering 250 tracks max. You can download My Music Cloud here Tweet It Like It Google + Linkedin Pin it Stumble Tyler Lacoma When he isn't enjoying the beautiful Northwest outdoors, you can find Tyler on business and tech sites, writing about the latest news, analyzing trends, and generally making the Internet a more interesting place.

I wanted it to play my Itunes playlists through my TV. I paid for it on Saturday – today is Tuesday and it has only downloaded 600 songs never mind my playlists. Complete waste of money, DO NOT be a sucker like me and pay the £29.99 for it Reply Kimberly on Do you have a recommendation for a service that would take my CD collection, rip it, and allow me to stream it? Murphie seems to be the only one I’ve found. Does it have competitors? Reply Yulia on Try Vox music player! Loop for Vox has unlimited cloud storage and Vox plays your music in lossless Reply Evan Glenn Potter on Excellent list- but what about MyMusi.cc?- its a great music storage site with no upload or playback limits. It’s what me and all my friends use Reply Bob Dylan on Tyler, Great list but you should should definitely include myMusi.cc among the top contenders. I have 3tb stored for free and they have great playback interfaces on my laptop and iphone. Its all browser based so its super easy, drag and drop music from itunes to browser to upload, drag and drop from Google images for album art. Highly recommended Reply Igor P. on Thanks. It seems like best choice for now. Reply Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Share Tweet Share Tags : iOS-iOS+ Apple-Apple+ Deals-Deals+ Wearables-Wearables+ There was plenty of excitement in the run-up the Apple Watch, which hit the scene just over a year ago. Initial sales sharply dwindled following a fair amount of early hype, and it remains to be seen whether this product category has a long-term future. Still, Apple is said to be pressing ahead with the second-coming of its wearable, which could be announced alongside the next-gen iPhones in the coming weeks. The impending nature of the new hardware means that the current model is cheaper than ever — down to below the $200 mark through Best Buy. UPDATE: The $199 variant appears to have sold out already. Right now, the basic Apple Watch Sport 38mm edition in Space Gray is down to $199. It's a considerable saving on the original starting price of $349 when the Apple Watch was launched, and $100 less than Cupertino currently charges. Sure, it's not as cheap as certain other wrist computers on the market. But with watchOS 3 set to add bunch of new features to the fold, now's your chance to grab the device itself for under 200 bucks.  Apple Watch 2 will apparently amount to a refresh as opposed to a major overhaul. Previous rumors of an in-built camera seem to have died down, and there will not be cellular support despite some users hoping for such connectivity. Instead, there'll apparently be GPS, improved waterproofing and the customary speed bump. In line with the next-generation iPhone upgrades, the new Apple Watch will look similar if not identical to the current fleet. Aside from the aforementioned Space Gray version, a number of other Apple Watch variants are currently available at for less than you might have seen before.

Especially when it scratches too easily, because of the aluminum construction with their ion-x display that scratches if you look at it wrong. Most watches use better premium and stronger materials.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Rare Apple-1 ‘Celebration’ model sells for $815K at auction Adam Westlake - Aug 27, 2016 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit One of the rarest examples of an early Apple-1 computer prototype was sold at a charity auction earlier this week. When first announced earlier this summer, the item was expected to reach $1 million or more, but it ended up selling for $815,000, with 10% of the proceeds being donated to the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society. The reason this Apple-1 model is so unique is because it’s a hand-built pre-production version, which was never to sold to customers. It’s the green PCB board that gives the auctioned model its “Celebration” name. Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak noted that when he and Steve Jobs were originally selling the Apple-1 back in 1976, there were only two production runs, and a green PCB board was never used or sold to the public. During the final moments of the auction, the bidding reached as high as $1.2 million. However, at the very last second the last bid was pulled, although it’s unclear why. Had the sale topped the $1 million mark, it would’ve set a new price record for an Apple-1 computer. Aside from the rarity, part of what the item so valuable was the fact that it included a near-complete set of original documentation, including early Apple 1 Basic cassettes, a period correct power supply, original manuals and marketing materials, and Apple 1 ACI Cassette Board schematics. Appraisers noted that they believed the circuit board could even be powered up, but recommended that buyers don’t try so as to protect the condition and history of the computer.

Weekly Roundup: Zero-day hacks rock Apple, WhatsApp changes privacy policy Posted Aug 27, 2016 by Anna Escher (@annaescher) 0 SHARES Next Story Understanding debt August, the weekend of months. This week a zero-day hack rocked Apple, WhatsApp announced a major privacy change and Tesla announced a new model that takes Ludicrous Mode to the next level. Would you rather get the Weekly Roundup in your inbox? Same, TBH.  1. Hackers are honing in on mobile devices. The latest example was an Apple zero-day hack targeting activist Ahmed Mansoor that employed not one but three zero-day exploits that were addressed by a patch. The investigation suggested these were the work of a shady cybersecurity company, and the software may have been used for years by governments looking to compromise political targets. So, if you haven’t done so yet, update your iOS devices to 9.3.5. 2. WhatsApp came out with a huge shift in its privacy policy. The Facebook-owned messaging app will now share user data with Facebook for ad targeting. You have a few options: stop using WhatsApp, or take advantage of the partial opt out the app is offering users for a short period of time. Here’s a step by step on how to opt out.  3. Google announced a major change to its search results. The company will start punishing mobile sites that make content less accessible with intrusive ads, by ranking them lower in search results. These are ads that appear right when you open a site, take over the whole page and have the smallest possible button for dismissing them. Good riddance! 4. Can Apple social? Apple may be working on a video recording and editing app that may be similar to Snapchat. There’s no mention of ephemeral content, but reports said the app is supposed to be easy to use with one hand for video recording, and mentioned filters and drawing functionality. 5. Tesla isn’t slowing down. The company’s stock surged after Elon Musk teased an announcement on Twitter, and then revealed a shiny new model. Tesla has a new Model S P100D that is boosting Ludicrous Mode up by 0.1 second 0-60 mph time. 6. Uber was just upstaged by a small MIT spinout. A much lower profile company called NuTonomy launched the world’s first self-driving taxi as its autonomous vehicles hit the roads of Singapore. The three-year-old company had been privately testing self-driving cars in Singapore since April. Uber, what say you? 7. What’s really going on at Hyperloop One – the futuristic transportation system proposing to shoot humans from point A to B at 750 miles-per-hour? (Besides a leadership shake up, lawsuit, countersuit and $80 million in funding.) The company is still in its early stages, but is gathering huge potential to change the transportation industry – if the company can bring itself up to speed. 8. For the first time, astronomers discovered a planet orbiting our sun’s nearest neighbor, Proxima Centauri. Proxima b is officially the closest exoplanet to Earth, but what’s important about this is that it’s at the right distance from its sun to support liquid water…and potentially alien life. Welcome to the neighborhood, Proxima b! This artist’s impression shows a view of the surface of the planet Proxima b orbiting the red dwarf star Proxima Centauri, the closest star to the Solar System. 9. Android Nougat came out of beta. It’s available for Google’s own Nexus devices (the Nexus 6, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, Nexus 9, Nexus Player), the Pixel C tablet and the General Mobile 4G. The most apparent change is in the notifications system, with a closer look to Google’s Material Design guidelines. 10. Y Combinator held its Summer 2016 Demo Days 1 and 2, consisting of presentations from startups ranging from farming drones, autonomous security guards to next-gen tampons. In-flight VR entertainment and security guard drones were amongst our top pics for the most promising startups from Day 1. Gunshot detectors, sales team analytics and credit reports for immigrants were some of our favorites from Day 2. 11. Harvard Business School students are taught about the art of venture capital. Among one case study the class learned last year was in fact the story of Rothenberg Ventures, founded by a HBS graduate and subject of recent VC downfall.   0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Apple Founded 1976 Overview Apple is a multinational corporation that designs, manufactures, and markets mobile communication and media devices, personal computers, portable digital music players, and sells a variety of related software, services, peripherals, networking solutions, and third-party digital content and applications.

Apple issues update after security flaws laid bare Technology Friday 26 August 2016 - 8:07pm File: Researchers at Lookout mobile security firm and Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto said they uncovered a fierce, three-pronged cyber attack targeting a dissident's iPhone 'that subverts even Apple's strong security environment'. Photo: EPA/Shawn Thew SAN FRANCISCO – Owners of Apple mobile gadgets on Friday were being urged to instal a quickly released security update to fix flaws exposed by a sophisticated attack on an Emirati dissident. The California-based iPhone maker released a new version of its mobile operating system, iOS 9.3.5, on Thursday, saying in a post that it doesn't confirm security issues until they are investigated and patched. Researchers at Lookout mobile security firm and Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto said they uncovered a fierce, three-pronged cyber attack targeting a dissident's iPhone "that subverts even Apple's strong security environment". Lookout and Citizen Lab worked with Apple on an iOS patch to defend against what was called "Trident" due to its triad of attack methods, the researchers said in a joint blog post. Trident is used in spyware referred to as Pegasus, which a Citizen Lab investigation showed was made by an Israel-based organisation called NSO Group. NSO Group was acquired by US firm Francisco Partners Management six years ago, according to Lookout and Citizen. READ: Extensive training essential to combat cyber crime globally Lookout referred to Pegasus as the most sophisticated attack it has seen, sneakily accessing calls, cameras, email, passwords, apps and more on iPhones. The spyware was detected when used against Ahmed Mansoor, a human rights activist in the United Arab Emirates, who has been repeatedly targeted using spyware. Phishing scheme After receiving a suspicious text with a link, he reported the matter to the University of Toronto's Citizen Lab which worked in conjunction with San Francisco-based Lookout to research the affair. "The attack sequence, boiled down, is a classic phishing scheme: send text message, open web browser, load page, exploit vulnerabilities, instal persistent software to gather information," the joint blog post said. "This, however, happens invisibly and silently, such that victims do not know they’ve been compromised." Mansoor received text messages on 10 and 11 August promising that secrets about detainees being tortured in UAE jails could be accessed by clicking on an enclosed link, researchers said. Had he fallen for the ruse, the Trident chain of "zero-day exploits" would have broken into his iPhone and installed sophisticated spy software. Mansoor was targeted five years ago with FinFisher spyware and again the following year with Hacking Team spyware, according to Citizen Lab research. "The use of such expensive tools against Mansoor shows the lengths that governments are willing to go to target activists," researchers said. The cyber attack on Mansoor was not linked to a specific government. UAE authorities did not comment on the matter. Lookout and Citizen believe that the spyware has been "in the wild for a significant amount of time". "It is also being used to attack high-value targets for multiple purposes, including high-level corporate espionage on iOS, Android, and Blackberry." Citizen Lab has also found evidence that "state-sponsored actors" used NSO cyber weapons against a Mexican journalist who reported on high-level corruption in that country and on an unknown target in Kenya. The NSO Group tactics included impersonating sites such as the International Committee for the Red Cross; the British government's visa application processing website, and a wide range of news organisations and major technology companies, according to researchers.

Andrew Tonner (TMFTheDude) Aug 27, 2016 at 10:23AM With broad market indices like the S&P 500 trading roughly 66% above their long-run averages, the search for cheap stocks to buy can seem daunting for the individual investor. However, the search for cheap stocks -- particularly good dividend stocks -- isn't necessarily as challenging as it might initially seem. Case in point, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI) offers plenty of investment opportunities hiding in plain sight. Let's quickly review the five cheapest stocks in the Dow today. Finding great value stocks can be a laborious process. Image Source: Getty. What are the five cheapest stocks in the Dow? According to data from S&P CapIQ, the five Dow components trading at the lowest valuations -- as defined by their price-to-earnings or P/E ratios -- are megabank JP Morgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), insurance stalwart The Travelers Companies (NYSE:TRV), credit card company American Express (NYSE:AXP), tech giant Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and struggling IT behemoth IBM (NYSE:IBM). Compared to the S&P 500's 25 times P/E ratio, this consortium of cheap stocks trades at multiples roughly 50% below the broad market. Here's a snapshot of each individual company's valuation. Company Name Ticker P/E Ratio JPMorgan Chase & Co. NYSE: JPM 11.2 times The Travelers Companies, Inc. NYSE: TRV 11.3 times American Express Company NYSE: AXP 11.6 times Apple Inc. NASDAQ: AAPL 12.8 times International Business Machines Corporation NYSE: IBM 13 times Data source: S&P CapIQ. Though grossly oversimplified, a host of academic research suggests that investors who buy cheap stocks can outperform the average market performance over the long term. This philosophy comprises the bedrock of "value investing," which was popularized by billionaire investor Warren Buffett. Perhaps it should then come as no surprise that Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway owns major stakes in three of the names appearing in the above chart: American Express, Apple, and IBM. However, not all "cheap" stocks are created equal. Any stock can be cheap or expensive for a whole host of reasons, some positive and others quite negative. As you'll see below, investors looking to buy value stocks always need to delve into the specifics of why each company sports its relative valuation. Digging deeper To further elucidate this point, let's briefly examine a name or two from the list above that are either opportunities to buy cheap or risky investments worth avoiding. As a positive example, Apple's paltry 12.8 times price-to-earnings ratio makes it a legitimate value stock for investors. Though its golden decades of historic growth are long gone, Apple still has plenty going for it today. Its shares today trade at their substantial discount because of what will likely prove a cyclical lull in its iPhone business. Apple will soon launch an updated form factor of its all-important iPhone -- likely next month. In anticipation of this, consumers have predictably held off from purchasing Apple's soon-to-be-outdated iPhone 6 models. True, Apple's iPhone 7 might prove to be a relatively unimpressive Image source: Apple. upgrade over its predecessor. However, given Apple's incredible customer loyalty and brand strength, it seems more likely that a disappointing iPhone 7 will simply shift iPhone purchases one year further out into the future -- when Apple will reportedly debut an impressive 10th anniversary iPhone -- rather than cause a mass exodus toward Android-based rivals like Samsung. Should this play out as described, investors willing to buy while sentiment around Apple remains muted stand to be handsomely rewarded. On the other hand, American Express stands as a counter-example. As the result of a few industrywide trends, AmEx finds itself facing several relatively new competitive pressures. The company lost key card partnerships with Costco and Fidelity, while also facing new pressure in the credit card space from big banks and increased regulations. Its performance has predictably suffered, and its share price has underperformed the broad market by nearly 40% in the past two years. American Express certainly isn't remaining idle in reaction. The company has enacted substantial cost cuts while also investing in new growth initiatives. However, unlike Apple, where a clear roadmap for multiple expansion is evident, American Express' path back to its longtime dominance isn't nearly as clear -- though it is certainly possible. Either way, hopefully this illustrates that investors looking to buy cheap stocks like those above should dig deeper into the particulars of each individual stock before buying.

Spotify doesn't like it when big-name acts take their music to Apple or Tidal first. But it's not punishing them when they do, by making their stuff harder to find in the music service's search results, the company says. That accusation, sourced to anonymous sources in a Bloomberg report out Friday, is "unequivocally false," says a Spotify rep. That makes sense, since it would be bad for Spotify's business if its users had a hard time finding music they wanted from the likes of Drake and Kanye West, who have brought new releases to Apple and Tidal before releasing it on Spotify. Spotify wouldn't comment on other charges, levied by sources in reports from Bloomberg and the New York Times, that Spotify wasn't going to go out of its way to promote releases from acts that went to rivals first. More from Recode: RIP Facebook Trending headlines, favorite punching bag of Media Twitter Spotify says it isn't punishing artists who cut exclusive deals with Apple and Tidal Google X's newest hire suggests it is trying to jump-start its self-driving car business Getty Images Drake performing That would make much more sense, since Spotify will want some way to signal that artists shouldn't engage in exclusives, which Apple and Tidal have secured by giving artists some combination of cash, equity and marketing support. For instance: Frank Ocean's new album "Blonde" debuted exclusively on Apple Music this weekend, and industry sources say it will stay there for another week or two. When that exclusive winds up, Spotify will want to make it available to its 75 million customers instead of giving them a reason to move to Apple, which says it has 15 million subscribers. But it will want to make the case to Ocean and other artists that they would ultimately have done better if they had let Spotify give it a full promotional push from the get-go. "Blonde's" Apple Music release this weekend triggered an internal announcement from Universal Music Group CEO Lucian Grainge, where Grainge said he wanted to stop future exclusives. But even the head of the world's biggest music label won't be able to stop exclusives if Apple and Tidal want to keep paying up for them. That's in part because some superstars on his labels will have the clout to get them, simply because other big stars did. Meanwhile, other stars on different labels have different deals and leverage. Beyonce, for instance, has a deal with Sony but is also a part-owner in Tidal, controlled by her husband Jay Z. She is streaming "Lemonade," her last album, exclusively through Tidal, though she eventually let Apple and other services sell downloads. Frank Ocean's example is the most intriguing, since he released "Blonde" on his own, after finishing up a contract with Universal. That makes him the most recent artist to become famous while signed to a major label, and then try releasing music on their own. Prince did it back in the CD era, and Radiohead tried it nine years ago with "In Rainbows." Tim Mosenfelder | Getty Images Frank Ocean Eventually, though, most artists who have gone out on their own have ended up working with big labels again, at least for some parts of their music-selling operations. Because while it is easy enough to record your own music, promoting it and distributing it have been hassles. And even really famous acts often like getting money before they make something, instead of hoping to make money when it sells. But those examples all come from the pre-streaming era. Now, when streaming dominates, and a handful of platforms dominate streaming, it may be feasible for big acts to record their stuff and hand it to Apple, Tidal and Spotify on their own terms. Which means the big labels will have to work hard — and pay up — to convince big acts to stick with them. —By Peter Kafka, Recode.net.

Barbra Streisand called Steve Jobs for IT support when her computer broke down International Business Times 27/08/2016 Alex Taylor © Kevin Winter/Getty Images Barbra Streisand Barbra Streisand demands the best, and this extends to who she hires to solve her IT problems. The US singer and actress revealed she once called the late Apple founder Steve Jobs to request he personally help fix her computer problems. The 74-year-old told Good Morning Britain host Ross King: "I couldn't figure out something on my computer and nobody could figure it out, no IT guy, so I said; 'Can you get Steve Jobs on the phone?'" "Sure enough, I asked him about this problem and he couldn't figure it out. He gave me his IT guy, who also couldn't figure out. That was funny." Renowned for her lavish tour demands after 50 years in the music business, these latest revelations seem to fit with her character. The news comes soon after she confessed to telling Apple's current CEO Tim Cook that the iPhone's inbuilt virtual assistant, Siri, pronounces her name incorrectly. Cook took over as head of Apple in 2011 after Jobs lost his battle with pancreatic cancer. Streisand, perhaps aware of how demanding the anecdotes make her sound, went on to try and assure viewers she was not always so direct. "First of all, I don't want to be rejected, so I have my team, my A&R man, my manager, call their managers. They don't just pick up the phone. I only did that with Steve Jobs," she said. A keen Hillary Clinton supporter, the star recently mocked Donald Trump by singing Anything You Can Do, I Can Do Better on Jimmy Fallon's Tonight show, report the Daily Mail. Streisand is promoting her new album Encore: Movie Partners Sing Broadway, on which she duets with film stars including Anne Hathaway, Daisy Ridley and Hugh Jackman, state The Times. Outside entertainment, the star is known for inadvertently creating the Streisand effect, a term used to describe how the attempted removal of information from the internet can lead to it being publicised more widely, after Streisand tried to have pictures of her Malibu home removed from an estate agent's website.

However, we aren’t expecting a sea change upgrade this time around. Three weeks ago, a KGI report noted that the new Apple Watch 2 upgrade would include GPS, better waterproofing and improved performance but retain the same design. Another report last week reaffirmed those claims. A launch alongside the iPhone 7 next month seems obvious.  Apple, therefore, is likely in a hurry to clear current inventory (indeed shortages are already being seen) ahead of the launch and that takes the form of a $199 price tag on the base model Apple Watch Sport 38mm Space Gray Aluminum Case… As 9to5Toys notes, a new Apple Watch hit the $199.oo price point last night at Best Buy, marking a new milestone in the pricing. Apple and other retailers almost always price match (but it is easiest to get at online at Best Buy’s ebay storefront) so effectively the price of the Apple Watch now starts at $199 at retail in the US.  Open Box models start at $180 and there are a wide variety of options including 42mm models. The price is $100 off of Apple’s retail price which was reduced by $50 earlier this year from its original $349 base launch price. I would guess that even after the update, the original Apple Watch will still sell for around $200 so if you have been waiting on a $200 Apple Watch, I think it is still a safe time to buy. At $200, Apple Watch competes well with other fitness bands and you get so much more, especially with watchOS 3 waiting in the wings.   Subscribe to our YouTube channel for more hands-on videos and reviews Guides Apple Watch View THe Guide blog comments powered by Disqus Submit a Tip cancel Submitting a tip constitutes permission to publish and syndicate.

Until now. Photo: Bloomberg New York/Paris: Apple has hitched itself to music celebrities to pitch Apple Music, the $10-a-month digital service launched a year ago. There was the very public catering to Taylor Swift. Apple broke out its checkbook for exclusive rights to albums from Frank Ocean and Chance the Rapper. Trent Reznor from Nine Inch Nails and Dr. Dre are Apple executives now. Apple Music is so beyond cool it’s frozen. But to take Apple Music mainstream, Apple needs to cozy up not only to the hip musicians but also to the dull guys in suits who run the world’s mobile phone companies. They won’t get Tim Cook into hot parties, but the phone companies are crucial to Apple Music’s future. In Europe and other parts of the globe, it has become common for carriers like Vodafone in the UK or Orange in France to pair phone plans with short-term discounted or free subscriptions to Spotify, Deezer or other streaming music services. Paying a monthly subscription is still a fairly novel way to buy music, and free or low-cost trial offers through mobile phone companies have become one of the biggest ways to sell people on the benefits of membership. Such music bundles represented more than one-fifth of global music subscribers in 2015, according to music industry analyst Mark Mulligan. Apple on its own offers three months free of Apple Music, but it hasn’t really struck deals with phone carriers to promote Apple Music. Until now. Apple and BT Group’s EE, the biggest mobile phone carrier in the UK, are teaming up to give EE customers six months of Apple Music free. The deal has the potential to double the subscriber count for Apple Music if EE’s 14 million 4G wireless customers are added to Apple Music’s existing 15 million paying subscribers. Apple from the earliest days of the iPhone has had rocky relationships with mobile carriers. Almost on principle, Apple thought they didn’t care about consumers and Apple did. But right now, Apple really, really believes in the principle that Apple Music should be huge. Steve Jobs and Apple dismissed streaming music until the rise of companies like Spotify and Pandora proved people were happy to listen to music online without paying for iTunes downloads. Apple wants Apple Music to succeed to continue the company’s heritage on the music vanguard and to keep people buying iPhones. The company should strike even more EE-like deals with its friends/antagonists in the mobile phone business to ensure Apple Music catches on. There are always perils of leaning too hard on phone companies to market an app or digital feature. People who receive a free service might not want it or be unwilling to pay for it. Or the phone company will lose interest in the promotions and stop pushing them aggressively. The symbol for this danger is French music subscription service Deezer, which was seriously wounded by a partnership with Orange it used to increase subscribers quickly. When Deezer was trying to go public last year, the company disclosed that 53% of its 6.3 million subscribers were “inactive bundle subscribers”—meaning they had received the service as part of their mobile phone plans but hadn’t actually used it. Those 3.34 million zombie subscribers generated some revenue from Orange’s undisclosed fee to Deezer. But they weren’t paying full price for their subscriptions and they weren’t likely to keep paying their monthly bills for long. Deezer’s experience shows that it isn’t difficult to get people to try streaming music subscriptions. The key is doing the right things to make them stick around once their monthly cost goes from zero to $10 a month. The payoff can be huge. A person familiar with Spotify’s business said it was putting a lot of effort into teaching new subscribers how to use the service and had converted more than 70% of people on telecom offers to paid subscriptions. Apple could avoid Deezer’s zombie problem, but it needs to coddle new subscribers more than it does now. When Shira received a free three-month subscription to Apple Music last year, she received only two emails from Apple—one welcoming her as a new subscriber and another three months later asking her to set her iPhone to automatically charge her credit card once the free subscription ended. She didn’t. Apple has spent a small fortune to make Apple Music appealing with exclusive music deals and payouts to artists. To make Apple Music mainstream, though, it needs span the globe to get its service on as many people’s phones as possible and do much more to make sure they stick around once the free ride ends.

By Shira Ovide and Leila Abboud. Added by Agency Staff on 27 August 2016. Saved under Top, World Tags: Apple, Apple Music, Deezer, Orange, Spotify, Tim Cook, Vodafone Tweet Apple has hitched itself to music celebrities to pitch Apple Music, the US$10/month (South Africa: R59,99/month) digital service launched a year ago. There was the very public catering to Taylor Swift. Apple broke out its chequebook for exclusive rights to albums from Frank Ocean and Chance the Rapper. Trent Reznor from Nine Inch Nails and Dr Dre are Apple executives now. Apple Music is so beyond cool it’s frozen. But to take Apple Music mainstream, Apple needs to cosy up not only to the hip musicians but also to the dull guys in suits who run the world’s mobile phone companies. They won’t get Tim Cook into hot parties, but the phone companies are crucial to Apple Music’s future. In Europe and other parts of the globe, it has become common for carriers like Vodafone in the UK or Orange in France to pair phone plans with short-term discounted or free subscriptions to Spotify, Deezer or other streaming music services. Paying a monthly subscription is still a fairly novel way to buy music, and free or low-cost trial offers through mobile phone companies have become one of the biggest ways to sell people on the benefits of membership. Such music bundles represented more than one-fifth of global music subscribers in 2015, according to music industry analyst Mark Mulligan. Apple on its own offers three months free of Apple Music, but it hasn’t really struck deals with phone carriers to promote Apple Music. Until now. Apple and BT Group’s EE, the biggest mobile phone carrier in the UK, are teaming up to give EE customers six months of Apple Music free. The deal has the potential to double the subscriber count for Apple Music if EE’s 14m 4G wireless customers are added to Apple Music’s existing 15m paying subscribers. Apple from the earliest days of the iPhone has had rocky relationships with mobile carriers. Almost on principle, Apple thought they didn’t care about consumers and Apple did. But right now, Apple really, really believes in the principle that Apple Music should be huge. Steve Jobs and Apple dismissed streaming music until the rise of companies like Spotify and Pandora proved people were happy to listen to music online without paying for iTunes downloads. Apple wants Apple Music to succeed to continue the company’s heritage on the music vanguard and to keep people buying iPhones. The company should strike even more EE-like deals with its friends/antagonists in the mobile phone business to ensure Apple Music catches on. There are always perils of leaning too hard on phone companies to market an app or digital feature. People who receive a free service might not want it or be unwilling to pay for it. Or the phone company will lose interest in the promotions and stop pushing them aggressively. The symbol for this danger is French music subscription service Deezer, which was seriously wounded by a partnership with Orange it used to increase subscribers quickly. When Deezer was trying to go public last year, the company disclosed that 53% of its 6,3m subscribers were “inactive bundle subscribers” — meaning they had received the service as part of their mobile phone plans but hadn’t actually used it. Zombie problem Those 3,3m zombie subscribers generated some revenue from Orange’s undisclosed fee to Deezer. But they weren’t paying full price for their subscriptions and they weren’t likely to keep paying their monthly bills for long. Deezer’s experience shows that it isn’t difficult to get people to try streaming music subscriptions. The key is doing the right things to make them stick around once their monthly cost goes from zero to $10/month. The payoff can be huge. A person familiar with Spotify’s business said it was putting a lot of effort into teaching new subscribers how to use the service and had converted more than 70% of people on telecoms offers to paid subscriptions. Apple could avoid Deezer’s zombie problem, but it needs to coddle new subscribers more than it does now. When Shira received a free three-month subscription to Apple Music last year, she received only two e-mails from Apple — one welcoming her as a new subscriber and another three months later asking her to set her iPhone to automatically charge her credit card once the free subscription ended. She didn’t. Apple has spent a small fortune to make Apple Music appealing with exclusive music deals and payouts to artists. To make Apple Music mainstream, though, it needs span the globe to get its service on as many people’s phones as possible and do much more to make sure they stick around once the free ride ends.  — (c) 2016 Bloomberg LP Share this article Tweet Nico Apple Music needs chromecast support before I’ll touch it for now Deezer is what I’m using. Andrew Fraser Deezer’s “Zombie” problem isn’t a real problem for now. Deezer’s costs are linked to the songs streamed (something like $0.000001 per stream), so paid subscribers (even at a discount) that don’t stream are revenue with very minimal cost. The real problem for Deezer would be if those Orange discounted subscribers all streamed non-stop 24 hours a day. Edit: Zombie subscribers are an issue only when those discount subscriptions lapse.

We were sitting in Starbucks in Mall of the Emirates in October, and I was in the process of showing off the newly released Apple Watch that the company had very kindly loaned me for review purposes. I’ve paraphrased his remarks to make them a little more family friendly. I felt a little affronted at my friend’s response, having become one of the first in the UAE to get my hands on one of the most anticipated gadgets of the year. But still, I found his question a difficult one to answer. Despite all the hype, I still wasn’t sure what the point of the shiny new device on my wrist was. I still hadn’t found an answer four weeks later, when I took my Apple Watch off for the last time. Don’t get me wrong, it’s a beautifully designed device that’s useful for basic fitness tracking and keeping on top of notifications. But neither the Apple Watch nor competing offerings from the likes of Sony, Samsung or Motorola have made me want to upgrade from my decidedly non-smart analogue wristwatch. The question of whether smartwatches are a bold new electronics segment or a temporary fad remains unanswered nearly a year later, as the next generation of devices awaits launch. Apple is widely expected to unveil its second smartwatch, the somewhat unimaginatively titled Apple Watch 2, at its autumn launch event in California on September 7. The new device is rumoured to have a better screen, better battery life and, crucially, a GPS chip, meaning you won’t have to lug your iPhone around with you to track your outdoor runs as before. Samsung, meanwhile, will launch its latest flagship smartwatch, the Gear S3, at this week’s IFA mammoth consumer electronics exhibition in Berlin, after sending out some not particularly cryptic invitations earlier this month. ("Stay tuned for a timely innovation," Samsung Mobile’s Twitter account advised.) Details about the Gear S3 are similarly scarce, with rumours of a slightly larger screen, a few new sensors and possible multiple versions, including a special outdoor sports model. But are such new features enough for smartwatch owners to upgrade their wireless wrist wear, or to tempt others into ditching their Timexes for something smarter? "The unique selling point [for smartwatches] that many brands or app developers had to come up with hasn’t quite been there," said Ashish Panjabi, the chief operating officer of Jacky’s Electronics. "Many still sell it as a smartwatch on your wrist, which is why fitness trackers are [still] doing better." Much of the initial hype over smartwatches, provoked by the Apple Watch’s launch last year, appears to have dissipated, at least for the moment. The industry analyst IDC reported a 32 per cent drop in global smartwatch shipments for the second quarter of the year, as customers hold on for the launch of the Apple Watch 2 and Samsung Gear S3 before splashing out. While Apple bore the brunt of the slowdown, slowing Apple Watch sales appears to have sucked out much of the momentum in the market as a whole. "A decline for Apple leads to a decline in the entire market," said Jitesh Ubrani, the senior research analyst for IDC Mobile Device Trackers. "Every vendor faces similar challenges related to fashion and functionality, and though we expect improvements next year, growth in the remainder of 2016 will likely be muted." That’s not to say that the smartwatch is dead yet. IDC predicts that the market will return to growth next year, as platforms continue to develop and the number of apps increase. Mr Panjabi said that Samsung’s flagship, the Gear S2, outperformed the company’s previous smartphones, noting that fitness tracking smartwatch apps such as S-Health have significantly improved. While Apple still doesn’t disclose sales figures for the Apple Watch, Tim Cook, the chief executive, said that customer satisfaction was "off the charts" in Apple’s last earnings release. That customer satisfaction can be found in some unexpected places. The friend who laughed at my Apple Watch? Turns out he bought one for his wife just a week later. She’s still wearing it nearly a year later. jeverington@thenational.ae Follow The National’s Business section on Twitter Pages: Add your comment View all comments Related Apple Watch 2 review: An improvement, but still no must-have feature Review: App makes living with shifting schedules easier Apple Watch 2 unveiled: Focus on the health and fitness community iPhone 7: The moment Apple fans have been waiting for is here More Technology Review: SignEasy takes the legwork out of submitting your documents Badly burned Samsung sees tough year ahead Robin Mills: Energy advancements have a habit of changing society South African mines dig deep into technology MOST VIEWED Business | All Dubai Harbour: Sheikh Mohammed unveils major new project with Middle East’s biggest marina Adnoc CEO Al Jaber says we are just getting started after steering unprecedented year of change at Abu Dhabi state oil company Lack of snow chills French ski resorts Insurers in UAE rally amid M&A speculation Emirati takes the road less travelled with career in UAE tourism Majid Al Futtaim to open distribution centre in Dubai amid expansion UAE online job postings down 35% but improvement expected The National’s business reporters look ahead to what 2017 has in store Signs of recovery adding up for US oil sector Meydan raises Dh1 billion to get projects moving ahead of Expo 2020 More Most Viewed Dubai Harbour: Sheikh Mohammed unveils major new project with Middle East’s biggest marina Boss of Dh50m foreign currency scheme in Dubai arrested Family’s tears for Layan, ‘just a shy, innocent child’ murdered in Istanbul Album review: Run the Jewels 3 is a real jewel in the crown of hip-hop Pair fined Dh10,000 for insulting biker bride and husband online Escape from Aleppo: a reporter’s story of leaving the city he grew up in Battle for Mosul is emerging as a lost opportunity Adnoc CEO Al Jaber says we are just getting started after steering unprecedented year of change at Abu Dhabi state oil company How fog caused recent flight disruptions at UAE airports Get organised: 14 apps to make your life in the UAE easier More Most Viewed Back to the top EDITOR'S PICKS SME profile: Dubai entrepreneurs are making their name in wills Year in review: SMEs were the engines of the UAE economy in 2016 Where Abu Dhabi rents have risen and fallen, Q3 2016 – in pictures Where Dubai rents have risen and fallen, Q3 2016 – in pictures FOLLOW US Tweets by @TheNationalUAE SPOTLIGHT Survivors describe terror inside Istanbul nightclub Rafa Nadal still going strong, Andy Murray now the hunted: 5 things we learnt from Mubadala World Tennis Championship About us Contact us Work with us Privacy policy Terms and conditions Advertise with us Subscribe Sitemap super.ae alittihad.ae thenational.ae anazahra.com ngalarabiya.com adtv.ae adradio.ae admedia.ae

REV Asia Network News Business Insider SAYS.com Lifestyle & Entertainment Juice Hanger 8Share KLIPS OHBULAN! Toggle navigation Business Insider Singapore Tech Finance Entertainment Politics Strategy The Life Search for: Search Enterprise This startup is bringing Apple’s newest programming world together with one of its oldest Matt Weinberger Enterprise Aug. 27, 2016, 1:34 AM PerfectlySoft PerfectlySoft CEO Sean Stephens Over the last two years, Apple has quietly but steadily made big progress with Swift, its super-popular programming language for iPhone apps, lauded as both faster and more elegant than anything else out there. It’s definitely Apple’s most visible play around appealing to developers. But it’s certainly not its first: Since 1987, wholly-owned Apple subsidiary FileMaker has been selling database software to help make it easy for small businesses to make their own apps for computers, the web, and more recently, smartphones. And while it lacks the new shine of Swift, FileMaker has quietly built a solid, millions-strong customer base for itself over the decades, with Apple pushing FileMaker to local businesses from its retail stores. But here’s the thing: Despite the fact that Swift and FileMaker both carry the Apple pedigree, there was no way to use the two together — effectively barring Apple’s FileMaker customers from moving towards Swift as they continued to build out their smartphone apps.  This is where a startup called PerfectlySoft comes in. Today, PerfectlySoft announces that their flagship product Perfect, which allows Swift to run on servers as well as it does on the iPhone, gets a free FileMaker integration. FileMaker Apps made with the FileMaker Pro tool. “It could really pull FileMaker into the iOS world,” says PerfectlySoft CEO Sean Stephens. “Now, you can use Apple’s entire ecosystem.” It’s a small move that could have a big impact on Apple’s plan to make Swift “the major language for the next 20 years of programming in our industry,” as Apple VP Craig Federighi put it in 2015. The importance of Swift everywhere Here’s how building a Swift app works, out of the box. First, you write your app. Then, if you want to have your app synchronize data with a server somewhere on the internet — and name a modern app that doesn’t — you need to put Swift away, and pull out a language like Python or PHP to write the so-called “server-side” portion of your app. That means that if you want to use Swift, you need two kinds of experts on your team: One, to write the app, and a second to handle the server stuff. That’s fine if you’re, say, Lyft, which can employ a dozen or so programmers on each side even as it moves to embrace Swift.  But it’s less great if you’re FileMaker’s ideal audience of small businesses. Which is why integrating the two is so important, Stephens says. AP Apple VP Craig Federighi “FileMaker developers would be foolish to learn PHP, but genius to learn Swift,” Stephens says. Which is to say, by using the Perfect integration, a developer can take their databases from FileMaker, use Swift to build an application around it, and then keep using Swift to build the server stuff, too. You only have to be an expert in the one thing. And as FileMaker developers increasingly take their existing web apps and bring them to the iPhone, in line with modern trends, it gives them the option to use Swift, which is definitely looking like the wave of the future in programming of all kinds. Swift opportunity That’s a big opportunity for PerfectlySoft in particular, given that Apple hasn’t really shown many signs of wanting to bring FileMaker and its millions of customers closer to the cutting edge of technology. “They haven’t really made it an obvious part of their strategy,” Stephens says. Ultimately, Stephens sees this move as just another way that Swift is going to get everywhere and be everywhere, on all devices. Apple is expected to officially launch the third version of Swift very soon, which will open the doors to letting developers write apps on Windows, PCs, and Android phones, as well as Macs and iPhones. From there, Swift is poised to take over the world. And by making it more accessible to everyone, PerfectlySoft sees it as paving the way for Apple’s success. “It really is a huge opportunity for Apple,” Stephens says. “I think we provide a big part of that opportunity.” NOW WATCH: Apple retail boss Angela Ahrendts told us how Apple Stores are changing Please enable Javascript to watch this video Share ​ ​ Tagged In AndroidAppleAppsenterpriseiOSiPhoneTech Discuss Get Business Insider Emails Subscribe Business Insider Singapore Contact Editor Got A Story Tip?

Home Church & Ministries U.S. World Politics Entertainment living Opinion iOS 9.3.5 Update, Fixes and News: New Software Version to Patch High-Security Vulnerabilities By Krixia Zhienelle Subingsubing Aug 27, 2016 | 1:15 AM Apple released an important patched version of the iOS 9.3.5 today to solve high-security vulnerabilities found in its previous versions. Users can get the patches through updating their iOS. The release came after two researchers from the University of Toronto's Munk School of Global Affairs, Bill Marczak and John Scott Railton, in cooperation with San Francisco mobile company Lookout, discovered holes that allowed targeted attacks called Trident. What makes it even more worrisome is that investigations from Citizen Lab believe that a "cyber war" organization from Israel called the NSO Group is responsible for the attacks. They have been targeting three of Apple's vulnerabilities to spy on dissidents, social and human rights workers, and journalists. What Trident means Yes, I want Breaking Christian News Submit Trident is an invisible piece of malware that works like a classic phishing scheme, according to a blog post from Lookout. It works on a spyware product called Pegasus, which they said is the most sophisticated attack they've ever seen because it exploits vulnerabilities only available in mobile (3G/4G, Wi-Fi, camera, email, messaging, among others). According to Lookout, the spyware installs persistent software aimed to gather more information. It targets three zero-day Apple vulnerabilities, which Apple hadn't previously known about. Highly-sophisticated and persistent, users almost never discover the intrusions. It designed its tools to impersonate people from Facebook, Federal Express, CNN, Google, Al-Jazeera and even Pokémon Go to gain its targets' trust. It can also target various apps like FaceTime, Skype, WhatsApp, Calendar, WeChat, among others. How it targets Citizen Lab reported how the software targeted Ahmed Mansoor, an internationally-acclaimed human rights defender based in the United Arab Emirates. Mansoor has been at the receiving end of repeated intrusion. This month, he received e-mails and messages purporting to contain details about prisoners being tortured in UAE jails. All the messages contained links. Mansoor then sent the messages to Citizen Lab who, alongside University of Toronto and Lookout, confirmed that he was being targeted. Not just on Apple According to Lookout's report, the spyware does not attack Apple discriminately. The spyware has been used for quite a while now and has been targeting high-value targets for espionage, including Android and Blackberry users. The intrusions all appear to persist even when the software is updated and could even replace itself when the exploits it uses become obsolete. Fred Sainz, spokesperson for Apple, urged Apple users to always update their software immediately to avoid security vulnerabilities. This is not the first time Apple has suffered major security flaws, however. Earlier this year, the Federal Bureau of Investigation hacked into the iPhone of one of the shooters in San Bernardino, California. Though state-sanctioned, the hack caused a furor across iPhone users, who insist that the same can be done against ordinary people. Sponsored Watch Your Favorite Christian Films, 24/7.

Home Church & Ministries U.S. World Politics Entertainment living Opinion iPhone 2017 Model Updates and Rumors: Apple to Remove Home Button; New Design Details By Christian Ver Marcelo Aug 27, 2016 | 12:42 AM Apple will reportedly implement thinner bottom bezels in the 2017 models of the iPhone, ditching the iconic hardware feature that every iPhone released yet has possessed. No More Home Button Rumors about the new and upcoming iPhone 7 and 7 Pro (or 7 Plus) are still ongoing and making their rounds in various tech sites and blogs. However, some rumors are skipping ahead and are already looking at the next generation of iPhone to be launched in 2017. One of the first rumors to leak is the disappearance of the Home button. The iconic Home button in Apple's mobile devices debuted along with the first generation iPhone when it was launched back in 2007.As the recent iPhones registered the largest display sizes in the lineup (5.5-inches for the 6 Plus and 6S Plus), Apple is looking for a way to make the device smaller and easier to handle. Yes, I want Breaking Christian News Submit They seek to solve this predicament through thinning the top and bottom bezels of iPhone. With symmetry being at the forefront of every Apple device's design language, trimming the top panel means taking away from the bottom as well, getting rid of the Home button altogether. Other Design Changes Gunning for the most premium looking and feeling smartphone in the market (and frankly, to justify the high price points of the iPhone devices), Apple is said to make the next generation iPhone body look like a single sheet of glass. This largely veers away from the metal and plastic material body that iPhone has been sporting since its inception. This move then steps into the competitors' den, as Samsung introduced their glass panel covered phones through the Galaxy S6 in 2015. In addition to this, the display is also rumored to jump from the LED-backlit IPS LCD display to an OLED variant. This technology will allow for deeper blacks and higher contrast ratios as pixels are individually lit where color and light are present. This would also be more power efficient as less strain on the display is applied. Lastly, Apple is also said to adopt the dual-curved display introduced by Galaxy S6 Edge. The screen panels to be used in the edge display of the iPhones will likely be supplied by Samsung itself. This move is seen by tech bloggers as Apple's way giving in to their rival as both OLED and curved displays are considered to be trademark features of Samsung Galaxy devices. Change is Coming With rumors circulating that the iPhone 7 to be released on September will not have a 3.5mm headphone jack, fans are quite disappointed. However, aside from this omission and the possible inclusion of a dual camera setup, the iPhone 7 will not see drastic design changes or innovation. Apple might just have added fuel to the fire with the probable exclusion of the Home button, but the iPhone getting a major design overhaul is a welcome change. With competitors stepping up their game in design and features, it is only fitting for iPhone to follow suit. Sponsored Watch Your Favorite Christian Films, 24/7.

Chris Neiger (TMFNewsie) Aug 27, 2016 at 6:41AM Image source: Getty Images. By some standards, InvenSense (NYSE:INVN) is a good company just waiting for its day in the sun. After all, the company makes motion sensors for some of Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Samsung's most popular smartphones, and it is moving further into the burgeoning Internet of Things segment. But instead of bringing success, Apple and Samsung have pushed down the InvenSense average selling prices. At the same time, Samsung has moved away from some of InvenSense's technology, and Apple's iPhone sales have taken a hit over the past few quarters, taking InvenSense with it. Essentially, InvenSense is a company with good technology that it can't make much more money from -- and its stock has taken a beating because of it. InvenSense's stock price is now down 24% year to date.  As the company struggles to find its footing (perhaps in the promising IoT segment), investors should look elsewhere for more promising opportunities.  Here are two:  NVIDIA's long-term potential NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a leader in the graphics processing units (GPUs) and graphics cards space, and its stock is up nearly 90% year to date.  That rise has come with the company consistently delivering strong revenue growth from its gaming, professional visualization, data center, and automobile segments, as well as its expansion into new markets. NVIDIA reported record revenue of $1.43 billion in fiscal Q2 2017 (up 24% year over year), boosted its professional visualization revenue by 21.5%, improved data center revenue by 110%, and jumped its automobile segment revenue by 67%. Gaming is the company's biggest moneymaker, and that segment's revenue increased by 18% year over year. NVIDIA holds about 66% of the discrete GPU market right now, and there appears to be no slowing down. The company's announcement of three new notebook graphics cards that come within 10% of the performance of their desktop counterparts proves there's still plenty of room for the company to grow this segment.  The company is showing that it has what it takes to be a great long-term investment as it continues to strengthen its core businesses while expanding into new segments like driverless cars. Apple's continual strength It's easy to think that the time for cashing in on Apple is long over for investors, but that's not true. Consider that the company's stock is currently trading at just under 13 times earnings (far below the tech sector average of 25), and Apple is just getting started in new markets like wearable technology.  Apple is the No. 1 smartwatch vendor, according to data from IDC, and far surpassed its closest competitor, Samsung, by nearly 1 million smartwatch shipments in the second quarter of 2016.  The company is expected to debut two new versions of its Apple Watch, with minor changes, this fall. The new features may not be enough to convince the general public that smartwatches are worth the high price, but they should be enough to easily keep Apple in the smartwatch lead. Research firm Tractica expects the Apple Watch to hold the dominant smartwatch position until 2020, if not longer.  And if you think Apple isn't innovating enough, consider that the company is likely expanding into the automotive segment with its rumored Project Titan car. Morgan Stanley's Katy Huberty believes Apple may be going after the shared mobility market that could be worth $2.6 trillion by 2030. And she believes Apple could take 16% of the market by that same year -- with $400 billion in annual revenue.  While InvenSense could still right its wrongs, Apple and NVIDIA are clearly safer bets right now for investors. InvenSense's beaten-down status may be tempting for value investors, but the company has consistently failed to deliver on its opportunities, while NVIDIA and Apple have brought investors huge gains.

FeliCa, for those unfamiliar, is a tap-to-pay standard in Japan that allows users to pay for things like mass-transit rides with their mobile device. FeliCa was developed by Sony and allows users to store train and bus passes in their mobile devices. With an iPhone that supports the feature, users will be able to store their passes within their iPhone, something that hasn’t been available in the past. While FeliCa is the standard on which mobile transactions in Japan are performed, with 1.9 million payment terminals supporting it, there are several different providers of transit payment cards in Japan. Apple, according to today’s report, plans to work with multiple providers in an effort to support as many customers as possible. The two major options in Japan are Suica and Pasmo. In addition to transit support, FeliCa also supports mobile payments and Apple is said to be in negotiations with at least one major financial institution in Japan to support e-money transactions. Currently, e-money is supported at a wide-array of vending machines and stores in Japan. During the company’s earnings call last month, Apple CEO Tim Cook noted that Apple Pay accounts for a small portion of Apple’s revenue, though a launch in Japan would definitely help increase the revenue from mobile payments for Apple. In 2015, FeliCa payment transactions accounted for 4.6 trillion yen, or $46 billion. Today’s report claims that Apple will introduce FeliCa support in Japan with the next iPhone models. The feature addition is continent upon smooth negotiations with payment networks in Japan, though, so if talks fall apart, the launch could be pushed into 2017 with the iPhone 8. It’s important to note, though, that Apple has already finalized hardware for the iPhone 7, so the FeliCa technology will presumably be included either way, with only a software update being required to enable it. This wouldn’t be the first time Apple catered specifically to Japan. In the past, Apple has launched specific versions of devices like the iPad to support Japan’s NTT DOCoMo carrier. Apple’s apparent decision to add FeliCa support to the iPhone in Japan comes as the company continues to face competition from smaller up-and-coming manufacturers in countries like Japan. Additionally, the latest Gartner data showed Japan continuing to have growing demand for smartphones, despite the global slowdown.

Pricing of the upcoming 2016 Apple iPhones has leaked online on Chinese site Weibo. Also Read: Top 7 Leaks which suggest Apple iPhone 7 will be a major upgrade over iPhone 6S We have been floating around the specifications of the Apple iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. However, at times, we also heard of the iPhone 7 Pro which will be the high-end smartphone of Apple this year. Having said that, there aren't many leaks of the iPhone 7 Pro for a while, however, today's leak suggests that Apple will release three models of the iPhone 7 this year or this September. Coming to the leak, the Weibo post says that the iPhone 7 32GB model will be priced at CNY 5288 (approx. Rs. 53,000), the 64GB variants retails at CNY 6088 (approx. Rs. 61,000), and the 256GB variant costs CNY 7088 (approx. Rs. 71,000). On the other hand, the iPhone 7 Plus costs CNY 6088 (approx Rs. 60,999) for the 32GB variant, CNY 6888 (approx. Rs. 69,500) for the 64GB variant. The 128GB of the iPhone 7 Plus costs as much as CNY 7888 (approx. Rs. 79,000). Also Read: 5 Leaks That Confirm Nokia Android Smartphones Are Coming in 2016! The higher end variant, namely, the iPhone 7 Pro will be priced at CNY 7088 (approx. Rs. 71,000) for the 32GB model, CNY 7888 (approx. Rs. 79,000) for the 128GB variant, whereas the 256GB variant ships for CNY 8882 (approx. Rs. 89,000) These prices are no surprising as all the previous generation iPhones have been priced similarly. Now, the major observation here is the iPhone 7 might be released with 32GB as the base variant, which is a good thing to see as previous rumors also suggested the same.

Java Webcams and DVB IBus Linuxulator Wine Browser Plugins Virtualization Skype ISO-8601 Upgrade Notes 9.x to 10.0 10.0 to 10.1 History FreeBSD is a fast, secure, modern Unix-like operating system with a fantastic community, great documentation, and powerful technologies like ZFS and LLVM. It’s my operating system of choice for everything from my beefy i7-2600k desktop to my home router to my ARM plug computer jukebox. Though famed for its uptime in the datacenter the same OS is just as suited to desktop or laptop computing with a little work. Why use FreeBSD? Maybe I’m just getting old, but it’s nice to use an operating system that didn’t spawn a billion-dollar anti-malware industry through frequent security failings, where you can choose the interface you like and reasonably expect it to stay that way instead of being forced into the design fad du jour, where you don’t have to argue about the init system being replaced two times in the same decade, and whose key organizations don’t collectively kowtow to Microsoft when convenient. I’ve used many operating systems and have yet to find one more consistent and cohesive yet as well-supported as the BSD family, and FreeBSD is the one with the biggest community and most available drivers for things like graphics cards. “FreeBSD on the server, Linux on the desktop” is an oft-seen sentiment among some FreeBSD enthusiasts, and it’s sort of understandable considering the conservative out-of-the-box FreeBSD installation. Despite that, FreeBSD is just a few settings away from being an easy, powerful Desktop OS rivaling Linux, complete with the same software ecosystem available through the Ports collection. Unlike Linux where everything including the kernel is a package, FreeBSD is developed in a single source tree and released on a set schedule – twice a year – as a complete operating system on top of which you can install third-party software. The Release Engineering page tracks the release history and schedule. Two major branches see releases in parallel, and major branches tend to live for two years (four minor versions) after their x.0 release. FreeBSD 10.x is currently the newest release branch with 9.x in maintenance mode and major development happening on 11.x. This guide attempts to show users with various hardware configurations the best way to configure a usable modern workstation running FreeBSD based on my own experience with Emi, my FreeBSD workstation. There are projects such as PC-BSD and GhostBSD that can give you a good out-of-the-box desktop FreeBSD experience, but I find them disconnected from the underlying operating systems because they dump you into KDE or XFCE and attempt to hide as much of FreeBSD as possible behind graphical configuration. That’s not a bad thing, and I’m glad those projects exist, but this guide gets there in the other direction. You will install FreeBSD, learn how it works, and configure it into a great desktop. Compare this guide to something like Linux From Scratch or a Gentoo installation and you’ll see what a breeze this really is. Let’s do it! New Installations The Getting FreeBSD page has links to ISOs for the six tier 1 architectures. This guide focuses on amd64/i386 PCs though is broadly applicable to them all. The ISOs are available in bootonly, CD, DVD, and memstick. I usually grab the nearest >1GB USB drive and dd the newest memstick image to it. The larger DVD images are available complete with Ports distribution files for those doing fully-offline installations. Starting with 10.1 you also have the choice of uefi images, that being the first release to ship with the EFI version of the loader. Give it a shot if you have a computer with UEFI instead of an old-school BIOS, but be warned it is new and still sensitive to UEFI implementations that are incomplete or deviate from the standard. Booting it on my Macbook, for example, leaves me with a useless black screen console despite everything running correctly in the background (Bug 193745), but Apple are well-known for their shoddy UEFI implementation. Boot the chosen installation media via whatever means your computer can (EFI boot menu, BIOS setting, fallback) and get ready to install. FreeBSD will boot to bsdinstall and offer to Install, load an interactive rescue shell, or just boot normally off the installation disk. Choose Install, choose the keyboard mapping appropriate for your computer, and enter a hostname for your machine. When asked to choose system components I recommend selecting all of them. doc is useful to have locally if your Internet connection isn’t working, and system src is needed for some Ports to build and install. Disks On the next screen, Partitioning, select either the Auto (ZFS) option or the Auto (UFS) option. UFS is the traditional Unix file system and is usable on any machine. It is fragile in the case of power loss or crashes unless journaled. ZFS, on the other hand, is both a volume (pool) manager and a great filesystem. I strongly recommend ZFS for modern computers due to its resilience and rich feature set that makes it very practical for desktop use. It checksums your data constantly to ensure integrity and prevent silent corruption on-disk, and its copy-on-write model never overwrites blocks, eliminating the RAID-5 write hole. It supports snapshots, allowing you to snapshot a filesystem at an arbitrary point in time and roll back to it at will, like Apple’s Time Machine, and snapshots can be sent seamlessly across a network for incremental backups. It supports SSD cache devices to speed up reads and writes of pools backed by magnetic hard drives. It can deduplicate files, reducing the on-disk space for files that are significantly identical at the cost of lots of RAM. Achieving these features makes ZFS very memory-hungry. Plan to have 1GiB of physical memory for every 1TB of space in a zpool and much more if deduplication is used. ZFS can be tuned for tighter memory limitations, but very limited systems should use UFS instead. Most modern machines should not need to tune ZFS at all. It will use the memory available to it but also respond to memory pressure when other processes need RAM. Assuming you choose ZFS, set up your zpool. The pool can be a single disk (still called stripe but just striped with itself), a mirror, or any combination of disks in RAID-Z. Name the pool something. I usually name boot pools after the hostname of the machine and then data pools by function. The other ZFS options are dictated by your hardware. If you have an Advanced Format hard disk (any made in the last few years) or an SSD you should force 4k sectors. If your computer has a recent Intel or AMD CPU supporting AES instruction set there is very little downside to encrypting your pool. I recommend it for any pool that doesn’t need to automatically mount at boot, i.e. I use encryption on my workstation but not on my FreeBSD router. Encrypting multiple physical devices with the same key will only require the passphrase once. You will be prompted for the passphrase while the kernel has loaded and is detecting hardware. On my system the passphrase prompt usually gets buried under my USB devices as the kernel enumerates them, so if you find yourself stuck there at boot hit a few keys and Enter to make the passphrase prompt reappear. Use GUID Partition Table (GPT) if your computer uses EFI. PCs with BIOS most likely need to use a legacy MBR. GPT is a requirement to use disks over 2TB in size because MBR can address a maximum of 232 x 512 bytes, just larger than 2TB. The amount of swap space you use if any is dictated by the amount of memory in your computer and the loads you plan to place on it. Conventional wisdom says to use a swap size double the amount of physical memory in the machine, but I find that to apply less and less when you get up into double-digit gigabytes of RAM. My computer has 16GiB or physical memory and 8GiB of swap space defined. On some systems I don’t touch swap at all, but I recommend having at least some. You can enlarge it later. Finish Once your disks are set up the installer will copy files and prompt you for the base configuration of things such root password, time zone, and network options. It will ask you to add at least one non-root user. When creating your personal user account be sure to invite it to the wheel and operator user groups. wheel membership is necessary to gain root privileges for administration tasks, and you will assign operator device permissions later in this guide. When prompted you can remove the install disk and reboot into your new system! Upgrading Are you running a previous version already? The upgrade process is covered in full in Chapter 24 of the Handbook, but assuming you are running the stock GENERIC kernel the process is very simple using freebsd-update. Check my upgrade notes section for specific version instructions. First, fetch the new system using freebsd-update install by specifying the -r argument. Without -r it will just fetch security and errata updates for your current minor version. You can upgrade to a new minor version in your current major or to a new major version entirely. If you’re upgrading to a new major version, go to the .0 release first. Don’t upgrade from, say, 8.4-RELEASE to 9.3-RELEASE, but to 9.0-RELEASE first and then to 9.3. freebsd-update upgrade -r 10.1-RELEASE upgrade is interactive and will ask you to confirm the system components it thinks you have installed. Once it fetches the updated system files you can begin the installation process. freebsd-update install This will install the new kernel but not any non-kernel OS components like userland executables. Reboot via shutdown -r now, reboot, or a swift kick to the power switch. When the system comes up, log in as root and install the new userland by re-running the install command. freebsd-update install At this point your OS itself is ready to go but your Ports need to be updated to run on the new major version via your preferred method, such as pkg update && pkg upgrade, portupgrade, or portmaster. It is alternatively possible to maintain ABI compatibility with an older major version of FreeBSD by installing a compatibility library package such as misc/compat9x, but you shouldn’t unless you need it for a particular binary that isn’t available as source to build for the new version. Once that’s done you can run freebsd-update install one last time to chean out the shared libraries from the previous version. Reboot once more to your final updated system. First Boot Log in as root with the password you configured in the installer. Congratulations! You are now a FreeBSD user! The FreeBSD base system is a fully-featured operating system but as you can see does not contain a graphical environment or any third-party software like your typical Linux distribution. Before installing any of that you should configure your new system to be a better desktop. FreeBSD’s roots are in academia and the datacenter, so its default configuration is very conservative. The desktop or laptop computer you are most likely using is vastly more powerful than some of the configurations that will run FreeBSD, so there is room to grow without being unreasonable. You will need a text editor to edit configuration files. The base system ships with vi (not vim!) but for most users I would recommend ee. It’s part of the base system and is a simple but fully-featured editor like nano from the Linux world. If you aren’t happy with ee there are plenty of great editors you can install from Ports, like editors/vim, but let’s continue. If you aren’t entirely comfortable with editing config files you can re-access the graphical configuration screen from the installer by running bsdconfig as root, but I don’t think you’d be reading this page if that’s the case :) UTF-8 The LANG=xx_YY.ZZZZ environment variable sets the system locale to language code xx, country code YY, and character encoding ZZZZ. Language and country code affect default application language, number formatting, date and time formatting, string collation, currency settings, and more. By enabling a locale using UTF-8 character encoding, the system can understand and display each of the 1112064 characters in the Unicode character set, instead of just US ASCII as is default with LANG=C. Check locale -a | grep UTF-8 for a list of every available UTF-8 locale on your computer. As an American anglophone, I use en_US.UTF-8. Edit the login class capability database in /etc/login.conf to add a default character set and locale. Login shells will inherit the environment variables defined here in the default class or in a narrower class if it matches one. /etc/login.conf --- login.conf.default 2012-01-02 17:08:05.804291477 -0500 +++ login.conf 2012-01-02 17:08:16.996213774 -0500 @@ -44,7 +44,9 @@ \:pseudoterminals=unlimited:\ \:priority=0:\ \:ignoretime@:\ - \:umask=022: + \:umask=022:\ + \:charset=UTF-8:\ + \:lang=en_US.UTF-8: Rebuild the login database with cap_mkdb /etc/login.conf after making changes.

Here are a few you should consider before getting started installing things. The Qt toolkit has some options that can be set via any combination of the following knobs. If you change the QT4_OPTIONS after Qt is installed you will need to rebuild devel/qt4-corelib and x11-toolkits/qt4-gui. QGtkStyle is a selectable theme engine that lets Qt applications integrate more closely with GTK+ environments and can be enabled with the QGTKSTYLE Qt4 option. You should enable this option if you plan to use a GTK+-based desktop environment like MATE or XFCE. Once built you can select the GTK+ visual style in qt4-qtconfig. CUPS is the standard printing engine on Free Unix-like systems. Support for it in Qt can be enabled with the CUPS Qt4 option. Network Audio System is a network transparent client/server audio transport system and can be enabled in Qt applications by setting the NAS Qt4 option. echo "QT4_OPTIONS= CUPS QGTKSTYLE NAS" >> /etc/make.conf Tuning and drivers Change a few sysctl variables to enhance the experience of FreeBSD on the desktop, including expanding the amount of shared memory, tuning the process scheduler for desktop use, and increasing the limit of simultaneously-open files to something sensible. /etc/sysctl.conf # Enhance shared memory X11 interface kern.ipc.shmmax=67108864 kern.ipc.shmall=32768 # Enhance desktop responsiveness under high CPU use (200/224) kern.sched.preempt_thresh=224 # Bump up maximum number of open files kern.maxfiles=200000 # Disable PC Speaker hw.syscons.bell=0 # Shared memory for Chromium kern.ipc.shm_allow_removed=1 Some knobs can only be set at boot by the loader by setting them in /boot/loader.conf.

Otherwise, there’s no need to expose your system. /etc/rc.conf # Remote logins sshd_enable="YES" Mounts The procfs and fdescfs virtual filesystems are not a default part of BSD but are frequently required for compatibility with programs and environments written with Linux in mind, such as GNOME/MATE and KDE. The FreeBSD equivalent is sysctl, but you can mount /proc too if you plan to use software requiring it. Some special filesystems like fdescfs must be mounted late on ZFS-rooted systems since the location of their mountpoint won’t exist until late in the boot process. /etc/fstab proc /proc procfs rw 0 0 fdesc /dev/fd fdescfs rw,auto,late 0 0 Toggle the sysctl that lets users mount disks. /etc/sysctl.conf # Allow users to mount disks vfs.usermount=1 If you neglected to add your personal user account to the wheel and operator groups at creation, now is a good time to do so. wheel membership lets you use su to become root, and operator membership is required for device permissions in this configuration. In this example my user is nicole. Substitute it for yours. pw usermod nicole -G wheel pw usermod nicole -G operator Device Permissions Relax default permissions on the device filesystem to allow normal users access to a variety of disks and input/output devices. Permissions for devices existing at boot time are set in devfs.conf. Each line defines a full device path and octal permission value. /etc/devfs.conf # Allow all users to access optical media perm /dev/acd0 0666 perm /dev/acd1 0666 perm /dev/cd0 0666 perm /dev/cd1 0666 # Allow all USB Devices to be mounted perm /dev/da0 0666 perm /dev/da1 0666 perm /dev/da2 0666 perm /dev/da3 0666 perm /dev/da4 0666 perm /dev/da5 0666 # Misc other devices perm /dev/pass0 0666 perm /dev/xpt0 0666 perm /dev/uscanner0 0666 perm /dev/video0 0666 perm /dev/tuner0 0666 perm /dev/dvb/adapter0/demux0 0666 perm /dev/dvb/adapter0/dvr 0666 perm /dev/dvb/adapter0/frontend0 0666 For devices that may be connected post-boot, we add an entry to a devfs.rules ruleset. Rulesets must have a unique name and number, and their rules are composed of a path or quoted path glob and octal permission value. /etc/devfs.rules [devfsrules_common=7] add path 'ad[0-9]\*' mode 666 add path 'ada[0-9]\*' mode 666 add path 'da[0-9]\*' mode 666 add path 'acd[0-9]\*' mode 666 add path 'cd[0-9]\*' mode 666 add path 'mmcsd[0-9]\*' mode 666 add path 'pass[0-9]\*' mode 666 add path 'xpt[0-9]\*' mode 666 add path 'ugen[0-9]\*' mode 666 add path 'usbctl' mode 666 add path 'usb/\*' mode 666 add path 'lpt[0-9]\*' mode 666 add path 'ulpt[0-9]\*' mode 666 add path 'unlpt[0-9]\*' mode 666 add path 'fd[0-9]\*' mode 666 add path 'uscan[0-9]\*' mode 666 add path 'video[0-9]\*' mode 666 add path 'tuner[0-9]*' mode 666 add path 'dvb/\*' mode 666 add path 'cx88*' mode 0660 add path 'cx23885*' mode 0660 # CX23885-family stream configuration device add path 'iicdev*' mode 0660 add path 'uvisor[0-9]*' mode 0660 Enable our new ruleset. /etc/rc.conf devfs_system_ruleset="devfsrules_common" Sound Enable sound support at boot in loader.conf, and load it immediately with kldload snd_driver. echo 'snd_driver_load="YES"' >> /boot/loader.conf Then, cat /dev/sndstat to see your available devices. cat /dev/sndstat FreeBSD Audio Driver (newpcm: 64bit 2009061500/amd64) Installed devices: pcm0: <HDA NVidia (Unknown) PCM #0 DisplayPort> (play) pcm1: <HDA NVidia (Unknown) PCM #0 DisplayPort> (play) pcm2: <HDA NVidia (Unknown) PCM #0 DisplayPort> (play) pcm3: <HDA NVidia (Unknown) PCM #0 DisplayPort> (play) pcm4: <HDA Realtek ALC892 PCM #0 Analog> (play/rec) pcm5: <HDA Realtek ALC892 PCM #1 Analog> (play/rec) pcm6: <HDA Realtek ALC892 PCM #2 Digital> (play) pcm7: <HDA Realtek ALC892 PCM #3 Digital> (play) pcm8: <USB audio> (play) default pcm9: <USB audio> (rec) The hw.snd.default_unit sysctl variable controls the default audio output. I want to use the S/PDIF output of my onboard Realtek audio, pcm6, so I set hw.snd.default_unit to 6. Enabling the hw.snd.default_auto boolean will automatically assign hw.snd.default_unit to newly-attached devices. /etc/sysctl.conf # S/PDIF out on my MSI board hw.snd.default_unit=6 # Don't automatically use new sound devices hw.snd.default_auto=0 Networking If you didn’t enable networking during the install process now is a good time to do so. Here as an example is my computer, emi, a desktop with a wired network. I have a Realtek interface, re0. The name of your interface may vary based on the driver it uses. Most drivers are built into the GENERIC kernel, so your interface should be visible by running ifconfig. Common drivers you may see include if_em for Intel PRO interfaces, if_re for Realtek interfaces, and if_en for Midway interfaces. Read more about network configuration in the Handbook to learn about other possible configurations. Wired You can use DHCP and SLAAC auto-discovery on most home networks: /etc/rc.conf hostname="emi.aloe.cooltrainer.org" # Enable DHCP for re0 and don't let dhclient block background_dhclient="YES" ifconfig_re0="DHCP" ifconfig_re0_ipv6="inet6 accept_rtadv" You can bring up the interface and get a DHCP address immediately by issuing ifconfig re0 up and dhclient re0, again substituting the name of your own interface. Alternatively, you can supply static network addresses for your computer and default router: /etc/rc.conf hostname="emi.aloe.cooltrainer.org" ifconfig_re0="inet 172.16.0.40 netmask 255.240.0.0 broadcast 172.31.255.255" defaultrouter="172.16.0.1" ifconfig_re0_ipv6="inet6 2001:370:10f5:806::40 prefixlen 64" ipv6_defaultrouter="2001:370:10f5:806::1" Wireless For WiFi configuration, see the wireless networking section of the Handbook. I sometimes tether my desktop to my Android phone using a run B/G USB interface. It’s as simple as defining a new virtual wlan interface on run0, configuring wpa_supplicant for the WPA pre-shared key, and specifying the SSID and encryption standard (WPA). /etc/rc.conf wlans_run0="wlan0" ifconfig_wlan0="ssid Doubleshot WPA DHCP" /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf network={ ssid="Doubleshot" psk="pantsupantsu" } IPv6 My configuration examples cover both IPv4 and IPv6 because I have a dual-stacked network. Depending on your network you may prefer to enable and prefer IPv6 like me, enable it but prefer IPv4, or not enable it at all. This can be done in rc.conf: /etc/rc.conf ipv6_activate_all_interfaces="YES" ip6addrctl_policy="ipv6_prefer" /etc/sysctl.conf # Accept IPv6 router advertisements net.inet6.ip6.accept_rtadv=1 Firewall You should run a firewall. Windows, OS X, and many Linux distributions ship with a default firewall ruleset. FreeBSD does not, because there is no one-size-fits-all firewall configuration, but it does include one of the best software firewalls in the world, PF, courtesy of the OpenBSD project. Configuring a firewall can be a very complex topic. There are entire books on the matter. Shown here is the ruleset from my computer. It has rules for a single network interface defined at the top of the file in the ext_if macro. Change it to the name of your computer’s interface as seen in ifconfig. The macros on the next few lines define the TCP and UDP ports on which this ruleset will allow incoming connections. My computer runs an SSH server on the default port, runs www/subsonic on port 443 (HTTPS), and has control ports for net/mosh in the 60000 range. You can open ports for additional services by defining them in those macros. The named services like ssh are defined in /etc/services. /etc/pf.conf # The name of our network interface as seen in `ifconfig` ext_if="re0" # Macros to define the set of TCP and UDP ports to open. # Add additional ports or ranges separated by commas. # UDP 60000-60010 is mosh control http://mosh.mit.edu/ tcp_services = "{ssh, https}" udp_services = "{60000:60010}" # If you block all ICMP requests you will break things like path MTU # discovery.

It will abort if your ruleset contains an error unlike service pf restart which will stop, fail to start due to the error, and leave you locked out of SSH. Ask me how I know this will happen. pfctl -f /etc/pf.conf Installing Software FreeBSD is historically famous for its Ports Collection, a directory skeleton of Makefiles and patches describing how to programmatically build packages of third-party software for your computer. Each port contains the metadata for that piece of software including the filename of the source archive, sha256 hash of the files, what other software dependencies it requires, what compile-time options are available, what files it installs, and any patches necessary to work around non-portable code or fix issues that can’t be upstreamed to the projects themselves. Every port has a maintainer whose job it is to keep the port up to date and respond to issues if they arise with newer versions of the operating system. For example, check out the ports I maintain! When you make a port in the Ports Collection it downloads the upstream source archive, patches it, configures it, builds a customized binary package, and uses FreeBSD’s underlying binary package manager to install it. Third-party software installed through the package manager ends up in /usr/local where it mirrors the hierarchy of /usr. It might seem confusing to have them in two places, but it gives a fairly clean separation of the base system from the packages. For example, /usr/local/bin is where you will find firefox after installing www/firefox, but /usr/bin is where you will find ee or sed. As you have experienced, configuration for the operating system is done in /etc. Configuration files for your ports will usually be in /usr/local/etc. Check the hier manual for the full layout. As of FreeBSD 10 there is a new binary package manager, known as pkgng or just pkg. It replaces the old suite of pkg_ tools such as pkg_add and pkg_delete and contains many advanced features that have been missing from FreeBSD for years. Compared to the old package manager, pkgng supports safe upgrades (meaning it saves a copy of the previous-version package to roll back in case of failure), multiple repositories, package staging before install, a more modern binary package format, a more robust sqlite-based package registration database, and most importantly remote binary package upgrades. Thanks to pkgng it is now possible to add multiple remote binary package repositories and get updates from them without relying on building Ports at all. I still prefer building from Ports to using the binary packages because there are many useful non-default options on many useful ports and many ports unavailable as binary packages on the default repository. FreeBSD Ports’ options are as conservative as the base system, so options that pull in optional shared libraries or enable non-Free features will be off by default, and binary packages from the official package repository will reflect those defaults. Examples of non-default options you as a desktop user will probably want include support for most of the codecs in multimedia/mplayer and multimedia/vlc, PAM support in net/samba36, USB printer support in print/cups, and many others. It is possible to mix and match binary packages and building certain packages from Ports using pkgng’s lock and unlock, but that gets more advanced and more annoying than is appropriate for this guide. I build my ports on one of my computers using poudriere then use that computer as a binary package repository for the other FreeBSD computers on my network. A new user with just one computer should stick with one or the other until they are more familiar with the OS. I use and recommend Ports for users in this guide for the customizability, but the names are equivalent. For example, when I say “Change directory to /usr/ports/www/firefox and make install” you can also use pkg install firefox to get the already-compiled package from the official default repo with default options. No matter the route you choose, you should begin by updating your pkg repository or your Ports tree. pkg update will fetch an updated index from every PACKAGESITE defined in that environment variable or in /usr/local/etc/pkg.conf. For Ports, portsnap fetch extract will retrieve a new full ports tree. You should read pkg for the list of commands supported by pkg and read ports for the list of available make targets in Ports, but in general you will use pkg install <portname> or cd /usr/ports/<category>/<portname> && make install to install software. The first things I usually install are sysutils/tmux and shells/zsh because I prefer it to the venerable default tcsh. You might be more comfortable with shells/bash. Once installed, changing your user’s default shell is as simple as chsh -s /usr/local/bin/zsh. Staying Up To Date Before updating your Ports tree or pkg catalogue I suggest checking out UPDATING. This file – also found at /usr/ports/UPDATING – tracks breaking changes in packages and the steps necessary to to fix them. It will tell you when configuration file syntax has changed, how to fix dependencies when ports split or merge, when default versions of packages change, and more. You can update your already-extracted Ports tree to the newest revision with portsnap fetch update. There are two common tools for programmatically upgrading your ports, ports-mgmt/portupgrade and ports-mgmt/portmaster. I prefer portupgrade because portmaster stubbornly aborts the entire upgrade on any error, but you might like it. The common portmaster usage is portmaster -a to upgrade installed ports. I usually update with portupgrade -rac, with -r -a to recursively update all installed ports and -c to preemptively show new port options so they won’t interrupt the build. If you are using binary packages you can update the package repository catalog with pkg update and upgrade your installed packages with pkg upgrade. The Handbook has a more detailed chapter on using Ports that includes upgrading and other tasks. Going Graphical I’m sure you’re eager to get out of the text-only console. To do so you need to install the X.org distribution of the X Window System. Change directory to /usr/ports/x11/xorg. Since Xorg is comprised of many modular Ports it takes a while to build and contains many port options (displayed to you as a blue dialog prompt.) Run make config-recursive in x11/xorg to set these port options in advance so they don’t continually interrupt the build. Read over the options as they are presented, but generally don’t toggle an option if you don’t know what it does. The defaults are default for a reason :) Once you’ve chosen all the options, run make config-recursive again, since it’s likely for a dependency enabled the first time to have options of its own. When no further port options are displayed run make install to compile and install X.org. X.org by default uses FreeBSD’s devd for hardware detection and D-Bus for interprocess communication. HAL used to be the default hardware detection mechanism but is in the process of deprecation, so you may not need it unless you plan to use a desktop environment that still depends on it. Check the dependencies for sysutils/hal for a list of software still requiring it. /etc/rc.conf hald_enable="YES" dbus_enable="YES" With Radeon, Intel, or otherwise This section explains how you should configure X for systems using an AMD Radeon and the radeon driver, an Intel grahpics chip with the intel driver, virtualized graphics cards like emulators/virtualbox-ose-additions’s vboxvideo, or any other generic framebuffer device supported by the default vesa driver. As root, run X -configure. It will spit out a new X.org configuration file in /root/xorg.conf.new based on your detected hardware. Copy this file to /etc/X11/xorg.conf, then pull it up in a text editor for a few modifications. Add an “Extensions” section and enable the Composite extension. Section "Extensions" Option "Composite" "Enable" EndSection Add one line to the ServerLayout section to enable AIGLX. Section "ServerLayout" Identifier "X.org Configured" Screen 0 "Screen0" 0 0 InputDevice "Mouse0" "CorePointer" InputDevice "Keyboard0" "CoreKeyboard" Option "AIGLX" "true" EndSection I usually enable the EXA AccelMethod and DRI by adding their respective lines to the Device section. If you have a Radeon card ensure your Driver is configured as radeon, not radeonhd! radeonhd is an older, Novell-sponsored, defunct driver for Radeon HD hardware, but -configure likes to pick it by default if it’s installed. You should use radeon instead. Otherwise X -configure should pick the best driver. Section "Device" Option "AccelMethod" "EXA" Option "DRI" "true" Identifier "Card0" Driver "radeon" VendorName "Advanced Micro Devices [AMD] nee ATI" BoardName "RV770 [Radeon HD 4850]" BusID "PCI:1:0:0" EndSection Enable the freetype, bitmap, and type1 X font modules by adding them to the Module section. According to the manual, “[t]he extmod, dbe, dri, dri2, glx, and record extension modules are loaded automatically if they are present”, but I like to go for the explicit configuration and define them anyway. Section "Module" Load "dbe" Load "dri" Load "dri2" Load "extmod" Load "record" Load "freetype" Load "bitmap" Load "type1" Load "glx" EndSection With NVIDIA Skip this section if you don’t use an NVIDIA graphics card. The binary x11/nvidia-driver is the only proprietary software on my system. As much as I’d prefer a free and open solution, I’ve found that neither Nouveau nor the free Radeon or Intel driver compare to the speed and feature support of Nvidia’s official driver. Install the driver itself, x11/nvidia-settings, and x11/nvidia-xconfig. To load the nvidia kernel module at boot, enable it in /boot/loader.conf. echo 'nvidia_load="YES"' >> /boot/loader.conf Run nvidia-xconfig to get a base xorg.conf in /etc/X11/xorg.conf. Pull it up in your favourite text editor and add the Module section to enable the freetype2, glx, type1 extensions. /etc/X11/xorg.conf Section "Module" Load "freetype" Load "bitmap" Load "type1" Load "glx" EndSection Later on, once you’re booted into the graphical environment, you can use nvidia-settings to configure TwinView and any other settings. Install fonts X.org doesn’t include many attractive typefaces by default. Luckily, there are plenty available in Ports. Here are a few I use, including many from non-Roman languages for better Unicode coverage. Arphicttf and font-std for Chinese coverage. Culmus and El-Mar for Hebrew language coverage. IPA, IPA UIGothic, IPAex, Kochi, MigMix, Migu, Mona, MOTOYA, M+, Sazanami, Shinonome, Takao, UmeFont, VLGothic, Hanazono Mincho, and Mika-chan for Japanese language coverage. A-Lee fonts, Nanum, and Un fonts for Korean language coverage. Anonymous Pro, artwiz-aleczapka, DejaVu, Inconsolata, and Terminus for terminals and editors. Cantarell, Droid, Doulos SIL, and Ubuntu for general Roman alphabet language coverage. Telugu for Telugu language. Isabella, Ecofont, and Junicode as novelty typefaces. KhmerOS for Khmer language coverage. Padauk for Myanmar language coverage. STIX and Computer Modern for technical and mathematic symbols. Charis, URW, KOI8, Geminifonts, CYR-RFX, and ParaType for Cyrillic and Eastern European language coverage. x11-fonts/webfonts is a special case. It includes the Microsoft Core Fonts for the Web such as Andale and Verdana. If you own a valid Microsoft Windows license you can get Tahoma as well by adding to /etc/make.conf first. /etc/make.conf # Enable Tahoma in x11-fonts/webfonts if you have a Windows license # You show me yours and I'll show you mine ;) .if ${.CURDIR:M*/x11-fonts/webfonts} WITH_MSWINDOWS_LICENSE=yes .endif Now that those fonts are installed you need to tell Xorg about them using a FontPath in your /etc/X11/xorg.conf so they can be used. Unfortunately the font paths in Ports are not entirely standardized. Most of them end up in /usr/local/lib/X11/fonts, some end up in /usr/local/share/fonts/, and some in just /usr/local/share/. Here’s the relevant section from my xorg.conf. Yours should look similar. Section "Files" FontPath "/usr/local/lib/X11/fonts/100dpi/" FontPath "/usr/local/lib/X11/fonts/75dpi/" FontPath "/usr/local/lib/X11/fonts/Caladea/" FontPath "/usr/local/lib/X11/fonts/Carlito/" FontPath "/usr/local/lib/X11/fonts/CharisSIL/" FontPath "/usr/local/lib/X11/fonts/DoulosSIL/" FontPath "/usr/local/lib/X11/fonts/Droid/" FontPath "/usr/local/lib/X11/fonts/GentiumBasic/" FontPath "/usr/local/lib/X11/fonts/GentiumPlus/" FontPath "/usr/local/lib/X11/fonts/Hana/" FontPath "/usr/local/lib/X11/fonts/Khmer/" FontPath "/usr/local/lib/X11/fonts/Liberation/" FontPath "/usr/local/lib/X11/fonts/LinLibertineG/" FontPath "/usr/local/lib/X11/fonts/Myanmar/" FontPath "/usr/local/lib/X11/fonts/OTF/" FontPath "/usr/local/lib/X11/fonts/PataType/" FontPath "/usr/local/lib/X11/fonts/TTF/" FontPath "/usr/local/lib/X11/fonts/TrueType/" FontPath "/usr/local/lib/X11/fonts/Type1/" FontPath "/usr/local/lib/X11/fonts/alee-ttf/" FontPath "/usr/local/lib/X11/fonts/anonymous-pro/" FontPath "/usr/local/lib/X11/fonts/artwiz-aleczapka-en/" FontPath "/usr/local/lib/X11/fonts/bitstream-vera/" FontPath "/usr/local/lib/X11/fonts/cyrillic/" FontPath "/usr/local/lib/X11/fonts/dejavu/" FontPath "/usr/local/lib/X11/fonts/dockapp/" FontPath "/usr/local/lib/X11/fonts/ecofont/" FontPath "/usr/local/lib/X11/fonts/encodings/" FontPath "/usr/local/lib/X11/fonts/fonts-indic/" FontPath "/usr/local/lib/X11/fonts/fonts-te/" FontPath "/usr/local/lib/X11/fonts/hebrew/" FontPath "/usr/local/lib/X11/fonts/junicode/" FontPath "/usr/local/lib/X11/fonts/koi8-u-gemini/" FontPath "/usr/local/lib/X11/fonts/local/" FontPath "/usr/local/lib/X11/fonts/misc/" FontPath "/usr/local/lib/X11/fonts/misc/:unscaled" FontPath "/usr/local/lib/X11/fonts/profont/" FontPath "/usr/local/lib/X11/fonts/proggy_fonts-ttf/" FontPath "/usr/local/lib/X11/fonts/stix/" FontPath "/usr/local/lib/X11/fonts/stracke/" FontPath "/usr/local/lib/X11/fonts/terminus-font/" FontPath "/usr/local/lib/X11/fonts/ubuntu-font/" FontPath "/usr/local/lib/X11/fonts/unfonts-core/" FontPath "/usr/local/lib/X11/fonts/unfonts-extra/" FontPath "/usr/local/lib/X11/fonts/webfonts/" FontPath "/usr/local/share/fonts/OTF/" FontPath "/usr/local/share/fonts/TTF/" FontPath "/usr/local/share/fonts/TrueType/" FontPath "/usr/local/share/fonts/amsfonts/" FontPath "/usr/local/share/fonts/cantarell/" FontPath "/usr/local/share/fonts/cm-super/" FontPath "/usr/local/share/fonts/shinonome/" FontPath "/usr/local/share/fonts/std.ja_JP/" FontPath "/usr/local/share/fonts/std.zh_CN/" FontPath "/usr/local/share/font-ipa/" FontPath "/usr/local/share/font-ipa-uigothic/" FontPath "/usr/local/share/font-ipaex/" FontPath "/usr/local/share/font-kochi/" FontPath "/usr/local/share/font-migmix/" FontPath "/usr/local/share/font-migu/" FontPath "/usr/local/share/font-mona-ipa/" FontPath "/usr/local/share/font-motoya-al/" FontPath "/usr/local/share/font-sazanami/" FontPath "/usr/local/share/font-shinonome/" FontPath "/usr/local/share/font-takao/" FontPath "/usr/local/share/font-vlgothic/" EndSection You can install other invididual fonts later as a user by copying them to ~/.fonts under your home directory. You can re-scan the configured FontPaths by running fc-cache -vf and can list all installed fonts with fc-list to check that they all appear. For example, I have a fairly large local font repository in my ~/.fonts/ directory and have 2313 fonts available on my system as of this writing according to fc-list | wc -l. Desktop Environments The best part of the X Window System ecosystem is the variety of environments available. You might prefer the configurability of KDE, the sparse cleanliness of MATE, something minimal like Window Maker, or even tiling like i3. This isn’t xwinman, but I’ve included screenshots and descriptions for some of the most popular environments to give you an idea what’s out there. KDE 4 KDE is the largest and most fully-featured Free Software desktop environment, based on the Qt toolkit. Its configuration options are dizzyingly numerous and it has excellent support for modern technologies like high-DPI displays. It has a modern compositing window manager, KWin, the web and file browser Konqueror that famously spawned the KHTML engine that became WebKit, and a family of other Qt applications like the excellent Clementine. The KDE4 meta-port is available at x11/kde4. You can start KDE with exec startkde in your .xinitrc, but KDE also includes its own graphical login manager, KDM which you can optionally enable in rc.conf and start as a service. echo 'kdm4_enable="YES"' >> /etc/rc.conf service kdm4 start MATE née GNOME 2 GNOME 2 was a venerable desktop environment made famous as the Ubuntu default around 2008, and MATE is the community fork of GNOME 2 after the GNOME team lost their collective minds. GNOME 2 is still available in Ports at x11/gnome2 but I can’t recommend using it since version 2.32 in 2010 is the last of its lineage. If you have a major GNOME craving check out the MATE Desktop Environment instead. It’s a well-maintained fork of 2.32 by an awesome team who lack GNOME’s utter contempt for their users. The MATE meta-port is available at x11/mate. MATE and GNOME users should configure PolicyKit to allow normal users to mount removable media automatically. /usr/local/etc/PolicyKit/PolicyKit.conf <config version="0.1"> <match action="org.freedesktop.hal.storage.mount-removable"> <return result="yes"/> </match> <match action="org.freedesktop.hal.storage.mount-fixed"> <return result="yes"/> </match> <match user="root"> <return result="yes"/> </match> <define_admin_auth group="wheel"/> </config> MATE doesn’t include a GDM alternative, so start it with exec mate-session in your .xinitrc. Compiz is a popular alternative window manager with MATE and GNOME 2 users. It gives you those fancy wobbly windows, 3d cubes, and all kinds of flashy stuff. You can install Compiz-Fusion from x11-wm/compiz-fusion. Be sure to disable the obsolete and unmaintained window decorator Emerald, a leftover from the Beryl project, when prompted on the port configuration screen. With Emerald disabled, compiz will default to gtk-window-decorator and will take on your normal GTK theme appearance but with more transparency and garish animation. Once installed, open Settings > Preferences > CompizConfig Settings Manager. You’ll probably want to enable the following plugins at minimum: General: Gnome Compatibility Desktop: Desktop Cube, Rotate Cube Effects: Animations, Window Decoration, Wobbly Windows Window Management: Application Switcher, Move Window, Place Windows, Resize Window Open the “Run” box with Alt+F2 and execute compiz-manager. compiz-manager is a script for detecting and using the proper compiz options for your video hardware. Your screen will flash while Compiz and gtk-window-decorator initialize and replace Marco, MATE’s default window manager. If your windows are missing titlebars, double-check you’ve enabled “Window Decoration” in ccsm. If all seems well, add compiz-manager as a new startup application (in Settings > Preferences > Startup Applications), then change MATE’s window manager preference in DConf: gsettings set org.mate.session.required-components windowmanager compiz To switch back, use the same command with the argument marco. Window Maker It isn’t as popular or well-known as the others here, but Window Maker is my favorite and longest-used window manager. It is based on the look and feel of the NEXTSTEP operating system, the OS that became Rhapsody and then Mac OS X and iOS. Unlike the extremely limited one-dimensional Mac OS X dock, Window Maker offers a main dock as well as a “clip” dock that is unique to each virtual desktop. Docks can hold normal launchers and “dockapps”, small self-contained dock accessories. You can install Window Maker from x11-wm/windowmaker and start it with exec wmaker in your .xinitrc. In addition, I also show x11-clocks/wmclock, sysutils/wmcpuload, net/wmnd, audio/wmix, x11/sakura, and x11-fm/rox-filer. The first time you start Window Maker you should run wmaker.inst to install the starter configuration to your ~/GNUstep directory. Enlightenment Enlightenment was the original eye-candy desktop before modern compositors were even a thing. Version 0.17 is the ambitious rewrite release that almost never came out until e17releasemanager got it out the door. It contains an eye-catching desktop built on the project’s own Enlightenment Foundation Libraries. E17 is shiny, bouncy, extendable, and very configurable. You can install it from x11-wm/enlightenment and run it with exec enlightenment_start in your .xinitrc. XFCE XFCE descends, like KDE, from the design of the once-proprietary Common Desktop Environment. As of XFCE 4.0, however, the desktop has become more of a GNOME-lite, the “other” GTK+ desktop environment. I don’t have much to say about it, but it is a very functional and lightweight desktop with panels, a window manager, a great file manager (Thunar), and some other lightweight applications like a terminal. You can start XFCE with exec startxfce4 in your .xinitrc. Cinnamon Cinnamon is a GTK 3 desktop environment from the Linux Mint project. It began as a fork of the GNOME 3 Shell into a more traditional panels and menus UI since many were dissatisfied with the drastic redesign of a beloved environment. It’s come into its own as a modern DE and offers everything you would expect from GNOME 2 or MATE with a cohesive feel and forks of several of the GNOME core apps. The only reasons I strongly prefer MATE to Cinnamon are the dearth of great GTK+ 3.x themes and Cinnamon’s inability to have more than a single panel in a multiple-monitor setup, issue #130, but the latter looks to be getting some traction as of late 2014. You can install Cinnamon from x11/cinnamon and start it with exec cinnamon-session in your .xinitrc. There is also a fallback software-rendering mode that can be started with exec cinnamon-session-cinnamon2d instead. No screenshots of this one since it won’t run in VirtualBox with any combination I can find of 3D/cinnamon2d and vboxvideo/vesa. Shoot me an email if you know how to make it behave otherwise check out screenshots of Linux Mint Cinnamon Edition on their screenshots page. GNOME 3 GNOME 3, available on Linux since 3.0 in the spring of 2011, is finally available in the official FreeBSD tree as of November 2014. The three and a half year delay is thanks to the upstream GNOME project’s years-long fight against any operating system that doesn’t have a penguin for a mascot. It took several years and a vastly waning userbase, then suddenly they care about portability again. Sure, okay. Either way, it’s here and you can install it from x11/gnome3. We weren’t missing much in the delay, since the GNOME team tossed out everything great about their once-ubiquitous DE and turned it into a shiny but unconfigurable iOS imitator where basic features and options are either not available at all, buried inside a settings registry more reminiscent of Windows 98 than BSD, or relegated to extensions that will break with every new minor version thanks to the lack of any stable extensions API and whose very existence are opposed by many of the main project contributors. Take a look at the GNOME Shell Extensions page with me and be amused that you need an extension to use a theme, categorize the Applications menu, remove the otherwise-omnipresent accessibility menu from the status bar, or even power off your computer without knowing about the magic Alt-button toggle. If you want a great GTK-based desktop environment maintained by a team that doesn’t hate you, check out MATE, XFCE, or Cinnamon. All three are excellent. I guess I can thank the GNOME project’s self-destruction for getting me back into Window Maker. Theming Finding Clearlooks too drab and blue? You can find a world of themes and icons for MATE over on GNOME-Look, for KDE at KDE-Look, for XFCE at XFCE-Look, for E17 at E17-Stuff, and for several lightweight window managers at Box-Look. There are several attractive and usable themes buried among the OS X Aqua clones, Vista Aero clones, and black-as-my-soul darkness-fests that are standard on any theming website. You can change theme settings for Qt4 applications with qt4-qtconfig and for KDE Qt applications (like Clementine) in the KDE System Settings. GTK+ is selectable in many window managers’ appearance preferences, and you can also install x11-themes/lxappearance for a light GTK theme switcher. Starting X The shell script .xinitrc in your home directory is the script that is executed for the lifecycle of your X session. .xinitrc is used to run startup applications and then run your window manager. When you finally end your X session your window manager will exit, .xinitrc will return, and the X server will stop. ~/.xinitrc xscreensaver -no-splash & xdg-user-dirs-update & redshift & compton & exec wmaker In my example .xinitrc I use Window Maker and start x11/xscreensaver, xdg-user-dirs, accessibility/redshift, and the lightweight compositor x11-wm/compton. This example script takes an argument to allow a choice of window managers. You can start an X session with startx or xinit <windowmanager> to supply the argument to .xinitrc. Starting your graphical session after logging in on a TTY is the traditional way, but I like to use a graphical login manager, x11/slim. It is like KDM or GDM but with no dependency on a particular desktop environment. After installing it you can configure the sessiondir directive in the SLiM configuration file to define the path to desktop entries installed by your ports, usually /usr/local/share/xsessions. Use exec $1 instead of a particular executable name in your .xinitrc to run the command from SLiM passed in as an argument. You can switch session with the F1 key on the login screen. /usr/local/etc/slim.conf sessiondir /usr/local/share/xsessions/ echo 'slim_enable="YES"' >> /etc/rc.conf service slim start The X session will use one of the virtual ttys. Once started, you can switch to a different virtual TTY with CTRL-ATL-F#. You can switch back to the graphical TTY with CTRL-ATL-F9. You may need to create a desktop entry for your window manager of choice if the port maintainer doesn’t ship one. Here’s an example. /usr/local/share/xsessions/wmaker.desktop [Desktop Entry] Encoding=UTF-8 Name=Window Maker Exec=/usr/local/bin/wmaker Comment=This session logs you into Window Maker Type=Application Extras and Miscellany Printing CUPS is the standard for printing on Free Unix-like systems and can be installed from Ports along with any needed filters. Install the CUPS meta-port at print/cups. Install HPLIP in print/hplip for HP printer drivers (and my Brother HL-2170W, for some reason). Install the Foomatic filter collection in print/foomatic-filters and its database and engine in print/foomatic-db and print/foomatic-db-engine, respectively. I find the CUPS-PDF virtual printer in print/cups-pdf very useful as well. Enable CUPS once installed: /etc/rc.conf # Disable line printer daemon since we have CUPS lpd_enable="NO" # Enable CUPS cupsd_enable="YES" Add local users to the cups group if you want them to be able to print. pw usermod root -G cups pw usermod nicole -G cups Start the CUPS service with service cupsd start and you should be able to access its web configuration UI at http://localhost:631/ in your web browser. It may prompt you for your root password to write the config files in /usr/local/etc/cups. Most full desktop environments include a GUI to control CUPS and add printers, but the web interface is available in any of them. The web interfaces’ built-in documentation can help you configure different models of printer, specifically the Network Protocols Supported by CUPS and Common Network Printer URIs sections. S.M.R.T. sysutils/smartmontools installs smartd and smartctl, a daemon and utility for checking the S.M.A.R.T. status of your local disks. Enable the sample smartd.conf. It contains one directive, DEVICESCAN, that causes smartd to scan all attached drives. cp /usr/local/etc/smartd.conf.sample /usr/local/etc/smartd.conf echo 'smartd_enable="YES"' >> /etc/rc.conf service smartd start You can check the S.M.A.R.T. status of a drive directly with smartctl as root. The -H flag will show basic pass or fail health status, and the -a flag will show everything. smartctl -H /dev/ada0 smartctl 6.2 2014-02-18 r3874 [FreeBSD 10.0-RELEASE-p2 amd64] (local build) Copyright (C) 2002-13, Bruce Allen, Christian Franke, www.smartmontools.org === START OF READ SMART DATA SECTION === SMART overall-health self-assessment test result: PASSED Java FreeBSD has several available Java providers, including OpenJDK and Sun's Oracle’s JDK. I recommend the newest OpenJDK for most people. It’s far easier to install than the binary Oracle JRE which requires logging in to a web page, agreeing to the license, and manually downloading the distfile for Ports. At the time of this writing the newest OpenJDK is java/openjdk8. OpenJDK 6 and 7 are available as well if you have software that doesn’t run on Java 8. If you need a Java browser plugin you can build and install java/icedtea-web once a Java provider is available. Webcams and DVB Most USB webcams and many DVB tuners are supported by multimedia/webcamd, and webcamd depends on the userland character device driver in multimedia/cuse4bsd-kmod. Install them, then enable them in rc.conf and loader.conf. /etc/rc.conf # Webcam daemon webcamd_enable="YES" /boot/loader.conf # Userland character device driver for webcams cuse4bsd_load="YES" You can use your camera device with pwcview available in multimedia/pwcview or with Cheese in multimedia/cheese. Cheese provides a nice interface similar to Apple’s Photobooth on OS X, but it has a heavy GNOME library dependency some may not want on their systems. IBus IBus is a modern IME for Unix-like systems, allowing one to input CJK languages. Install the main IME from textproc/ibus as well as QT application support from textproc/ibus-qt. You’ll need one or more input methods once the IME itself is installed. Ports of interest: chinese/ibus-chewing - Chewing engine for IBus chinese/ibus-pinyin - The PinYin input method japanese/ibus-anthy - Anthy engine for IBus japanese/ibus-mozc - Mozc engine for IBus japanese/ibus-skk - SKK engine for IBus korean/ibus-hangul - Hangul engine for IBus textproc/ibus-kmfl - KMFL IMEngine for IBus framework textproc/ibus-m17n - The m17n IMEngine for IBus framework textproc/ibus-table - Table based IM framework for IBus Heavyweight desktop environments like GNOME or KDE will let you configure the input method graphically. In GNOME 2 and MATE, for example, you can open the IBus preferences from the Settings > Preferences menu. KDE/Qt users can enable it as the default IME in qtconfig-qt4. Lightweight window manager users like me can start it in .xinitrc: ~/.xinitrc export XMODIFIERS="@im=ibus" export GTK_IM_MODULE="ibus" export QT_IM_MODULE="ibus" exec ibus-daemon -d -x & Now run any GTK or QT application, press your keyboard shortcut to switch input methods, and test it out. Linuxulator FreeBSD’s Linuxulator allows it to run Linux application binaries using system call translation. Desktop users will find it useful for running the handful of proprietary but necessary programs that are available for Linux but not for FreeBSD, such as Adobe Flash Player. Install the Linux base distribution from Ports. As I write this the default base distribution is emulators/linux_base-c6, based on CentOS 6, replacing the old Fedora 10 based emulators/linux_base-f10. Unless you need to use a particular f10-only application (like Skype) you should prefer the modern base, overriding the default in make.conf and switching to the necessary kernel version in sysctl.conf before doing the installation: /etc/make.conf OVERRIDE_LINUX_BASE_PORT=c6 OVERRIDE_LINUX_NONBASE_PORTS=c6 echo 'compat.linux.osrelease=2.6.18' >> /etc/sysctl.conf sysctl -f /etc/sysctl.conf Once your chosen linux_base installed, tell your system to load the linux kernel module at boot. echo 'linux_load="YES"' >> /boot/loader.conf Mount the linprocfs virtual filesystems for compatibility with GNOME and other programs requiring them. /etc/fstab linproc /compat/linux/proc linprocfs,auto,late rw 0 0 Besides proprietary garbageware like Flash Player I also use Linuxulator along with the Loki compatibility library package to run Loki Software’s Linux ports of some of the best PC games ever made, like Simcity 3000 Unlimited. Wine Wine is a free implementation of the Win32 API capable of running real Windows applications on Unix-like systems. It’s available from emulators/wine or emulators/wine-devel, containing the latest stable and unstable versions respectively. The optional Gecko support is an mshtml.dll replacement that will allow Windows programs to embed web pages using the Mozilla engine. The optional Mono will let Wine run Windows programs written in versions 1.x or 2.0 of the .NET Framework without using the proprietary .NET runtime. You can also download winetricks, a script containing Wine installation recipes for popular software, and you may find a Wine GUI such as emulators/swine useful for maintaining separate Wine prefixes. FreeBSD currently lacks the ability to install 32-bit ports on a 64-bit system, normally precluding an amd64 user from installing a 32-bit Wine capable of running 32-bit Windows applications. As a workaround, David Naylor maintains Wine32 packages for FreeBSD amd64. You can install them from emulators/i386-wine or emulators/i386-wine-devel. If you plan to use Wine to run browser plugins, use the compholio-patched version of wine in emulators/wine-compholio or emulators/i386-wine-compholio instead. Wine is very impressively-compatible these days. I use it to run a lot of games from Humble Store and GOG so I don’t have to fire up a Windows computer or VM. Wine is so good it is used to create the Linux versions of many of these titles, such as Freedom Planet, and in that case it’s a lot easier to run the same executable in FreeBSD Wine than to try and get the Linux Wine binaries running via Linuxulator. If every wine command fails with ELF interpreter /libexec/ld-elf.so.1 not found your 64-bit system is missing the 32-bit libraries necessary for Wine. You’ll need to install them. From the releases FTP, grab the lib32.txz matching your version of the OS and extract it either as root or with sudo to the root of your filesystem to install. The archive contains a full directory hierarchy so all the files will end up in the right place. fetch ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/releases/amd64/10.1-RELEASE/lib32.txz tar xfp lib32.txz -C / Browser Plugins Adobe Flash Player is not released for FreeBSD but is usable on FreeBSD i386 and amd64 through your choice of two wrappers. The 32-bit Linux version of the Flash plugin can be installed via www/linux-c6-flashplugin11 or www/linux-f10-flashplugin11, executed through Linuxulator, and adapted to 32-bit or 64-bit native browsers with www/nspluginwrapper, though it is important to note Adobe dropped support for the NPAPI Linux version of Flash with version 11.2 back in 2012. They left development up to Google who only release a PPAPI version as part of their proprietary Chrome browser bundle, something that isn’t even available for FreeBSD. Even Chromium will be unable to use NPAPI Flash after 2014 as Google deprecates and removes NPAPI support from Chromium and Chrome starting in version 32. For now you can still use it in Firefox and other NPAPI browsers, but I think it’s just time to say goodbye to this old version or to Flash in general if you can help it. To use nspluginwrapper, make sure linprocfs is mounted and execute nspluginwrapper -v -a -i as your normal user to locate and enable the Linux Flash plugin. -a automatically finds available plugins and -i installs them. It’s important to remember it makes a copy of the Flash library in your home directory when you do this, so every time you update the version of Flash installed through Ports you need to remove your local cory with nspluginwrapper -v -a -r and install the new one with nspluginwrapper -v -a -i. Adobe promised security updates for the NPAPI Flash Player through 2017, and if history is any indication you’re going to need them. A newer and arguably better solution is emulators/pipelight, a Wine-based wrapper for Windows browsers plugins. It supports the very newest version of Flash, freeing us from the limitations of 11.2, and also supports Shockwave, Silverlight, Unity, and more. It requires a special patched version of Wine, emulators/wine-compholio or emulators/i386-wine-compholio. Once installed, activate plugins as root. pipelight-plugin --create-mozilla-plugins pipelight-plugin --enable flash Silverlight is available as well and can allow you to watch DRMed NetFlix content via your browser on FreeBSD. I have no experience using it since I don’t buy DRMed streaming media subscriptions, but it can be installed the same way. pipelight-plugin --enable silverlight5.1 Heed www/pipelight’s pkg-message warning about Silverlight DRM if you have a ZFS-based system: For users running with ZFS on root, watching DRM protected content requires extensive xattr support. If you run into issues with DRM failing, you can use the “pipelight-mkufs” command to create a UFS formatted ZVOL mounted on your users ~/.wine-pipelight directory. Other plugins are enabled the same way, and the list of available plugins can be seen in pipelight-plugin --help. Virtualization It’s pretty common to virtualize another operating system on your computer, possibly to run a proprietary program or access a proprietary office groupware system. Whatever the reason, it’s easy to accomplish on FreeBSD. FreeBSD 10 has a new built-in hypervisor known as bhyve capable of running FreeBSD natively and other operating systems via sysutils/grub2-bhyve. At the moment it only implements a serial console to access the guest systems which is fine for a server OS but probably not what you want. Alternatively, VirtualBox open source edition is available at emulators/virtualbox-ose. Build it with Guest Additions enabled for the best experience virtualizing Windows and Linux. Once it’s installed, configure loader.conf to load the VirtualBox kernel module and configure rc.conf to start VirtualBox bridged networking. /boot/loader.conf vboxdrv_load="YES" /etc/rc.conf vboxnet_enable="YES" /etc/devfs.conf # Allow VirtualBox network access own vboxnetctl root:vboxusers perm vboxnetctl 0660 pw usermod nicole -G vboxusers Skype Skype is bad, proprietary software that doesn’t value your freedom. Use audio/mumble or net-im/ekiga instead if you can. If you still wish to use Skype, make sure you have Linuxulator enabled and install net-im/skype. Version 2.1 of Skype’s Linux client dropped support for OSS, found in FreeBSD as the default sound API. Thanks to this, Skype 2.0 persisted for years as the version in Ports. With the introduction of an ALSA compatibility shim in FreeBSD 8.3 and 9.0 and audio/linux-f10-alsa-plugins-oss, we can use the newer ALSA-only Skype client. There is a newer Skype client available as net-im/skype4 that supports the CentOS 6 linux_base, but that version is not usable on FreeBSD 10.x due to missing syscalls in that branch’s Linuxulator. The ALSA client, unlike the old OSS client, requires some explicit configuration to use our sound devices. They must be defined manually in /compat/linux/etc/alsa/pcm/pcm-oss.conf, the configuration file of alsa-plugins-oss. In this example, I enable pcm6/dsp6 for audio output, and pcm8/dsp8, a USB webcam, as a microphone source. /compat/linux/etc/alsa/pcm/pcm-oss.conf pcm.oss8 { type oss device /dev/dsp8 hint { description "Open Sound System - Webcam" } } ctl.oss8 { type oss device /dev/mixer8 hint { description "Open Sound System - Webcam" } } pcm.oss6 { type oss device /dev/dsp6 hint { description "Open Sound System - S/PDIF" } } ctl.oss6 { type oss device /dev/mixer6 hint { description "Open Sound System - S/PDIF" } } The microphone volume can be controlled by invoking the mixer of your chosen recording device.

 The EU could hit Apple with a $19 billion tax bill next week Rob Price Aug. 27, 2016, 5:33 AM 4,615 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple CEO Tim Cook.Justin Sullivan/Getty Images The US and the European Union are gearing up for an epic showdown over Apple's tax bill — and it could happen as soon as next week. The Financial Times reports that the European Commission is expected to rule next week in a three-year-long inquiry looking into Apple's tax arrangements with Ireland. At stake is whether the deal Ireland struck with Apple amounts to "state aid," and is therefore illegal. Should the Commission rule against Ireland — which is what the FT reports is likely to happen — then Apple could face a tax bill in the billions. The exact amount is up in the air — though JP Morgan estimates it could be as much as a whopping $19 billion. The Obama administration is watching the case with concern, and has warned the Commission of potential consequences if it rules against Apple and Ireland. The US Treasury said in a white paper published on Wednesday that it "continues to consider potential responses should the Commission continue its present course," and accused the Brussels investigation of being "supranational." Apple and Ireland deny any wrongdoing, and are expected to appeal if hit with a negative ruling.  Reached for comment, an Apple spokesperson pointed Business Insider towards a recent interview Apple CEO Tim Cook gave to The Washington Post. "It’s important for everyone to understand that the allegation made in the E.U. is that Ireland gave us a special deal. Ireland denies that. The structure we have was applicable to everybody — it wasn’t something that was done unique to Apple. It was their law," Cook said. "And the basic controversy at the root of this is, people really aren’t arguing that Apple should pay more taxes. They’re arguing about who they should be paid to. And so there’s a tug of war going on between the countries of how you allocate profits. The way tax law works is the place you create value is the place where you are taxed. And so because we develop products largely in the United States, the tax accrues to the United States."

McGlone  |  Aug. 27, 2016 Spiritual Reflections PrintemailPDF St. Paul, in today's reading from Galatians, summarizes for us: "May I never boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ." With the urgency and detachment of the 72, we go forth daily, bearing the good news of Christ. Then, as St. Paul says, we will be "a new creation." One internet ad for the Apple Watch promises you'll "never miss what matters" and explains that it's "you at a glance." It promises that this super gadget will become an essential part of who you are. The author of Hebrews would have understood the philosophical field where this ad grew up. Twenty-second Sunday in Ordinary Time Sirach 3:17-18, 20, 28-29 Psalm 68 Hebrews 12:18-19, 22-24a Luke 14:1, 7-14 This final section of Hebrews is very much about helping people to discern what matters and understand who they are. The essential difference is that while Apple promises to put it all on your wrist, the author of Hebrews says we'll understand it through celebrating with a community. This selection from Hebrews invites us to glimpse the future coming toward us from God. The God who made Moses' mountains rumble has prepared a festival in the holy city where everyone and everything is coming to perfection: the fullness, the joy of union with God and one another for which we were created -- something we have already but just barely tasted in moments of grace. This is the sort of vision that freed Jesus to be just exactly who he was, whether on the road, praying alone or at a party. This week, Luke takes us to another party with Jesus. At times, Jesus must have felt like some of today's banquetgoers: unsure of what will be less pleasant, the lukewarm food or the people who attend just to be seen. In reality, we don't have a single story of a meal Jesus shared that didn't involve some sort of contention. (Why does he let her touch him? Why does he eat and drink with sinners? Why don't they wash their hands? Martha, Martha, the company is more important than the menu! And finally, "The hand of the one who will betray me is with me on the table.") Get NCR in your inbox! Sign up for email alerts. But then, Jesus brought enough wit to each situation that even if breaking bread with him was rarely peaceful, it was never boring. Perhaps that describes not just his meals, but the process of conversion that they call forth. Ostensibly, this week's readings focus on humility, seemingly promoting it as a pragmatic approach even if it's not a deeply felt conviction. The Gospel scene in which the guests try to appear distinguished while at the same time vying for prime placement is one that begs for a Mark Twain depiction. Was Jesus acting like a jester when he offered his suggestions for how the guests could ultimately get the recognition they craved by pretending it didn't matter? The problem there was that seating arrangements didn't matter to Jesus, while others believed their dignity depended on their social location. He and they operated on different planes. The reading from Hebrews also deals with different planes, but in this case, they are temporal rather than social. Hebrews challenges us to place ourselves in biblical time and remember how our ancestors came to know and fear God. Then, just as we begin to grasp the utter awe of witnessing God's self-manifestation in frightening fire and deafening trumpet, the author says, "That's where you came from, but today you are somewhere else." With that, we are given a glimpse of the future God has planned. It is symbolized as a holy city, with everyone totally taken up in inaugural festivities. There's a banquet on every block; ecstasy scents the air they breathe. Here, time is measured in quality rather than quantity. The joy of this vision flows counterclockwise as our irresistibly appealing God draws everyone and everything toward the perfection for which we were created. This vision of God's future freed Jesus. Knowing where he was going allowed him to be just exactly who he was at every table. As he watched folks jockey for position and saw the embarrassed host try to herd them into the right places, there had to be a playful glint in his eye as he whispered to some, "Go down lower, then he'll have to come find you!" The twinkle surely grew when he said to the harried host, "Next time, invite the blind and the hungry. They won't notice where they sit as long as there's food." Even if he said it lightheartedly, Jesus was serious about the guest list revision, and not just because the outcasts would be more interesting than the inner circle. Every meal he shared was an experience of communion. Exclusivity in such a setting is a sacrilege. Seeking communion with people who are different from ourselves is a path toward conversion. It will be uncomfortable as our values get rearranged, but it will also be a practice round for enjoying the peace of communion at the festival God has prepared for us -- for all of us, without distinction.

Skip to main content NewsPoint Africa Main menu Home Health Research Science United States Home Report: Apple may build a FeliCa chip into next-gen Japanese iPhones Report: Apple may build a FeliCa chip into next-gen Japanese iPhones Aug 27 2016 0 By Steven Perry Bloomberg has revealed in recently released report that tech biggie Apple is apparently introducing a new feature in its much-rumored next-generation iPhone -- most likely to be called the iPhone 7 -- which would bring the tap-to-pay mechanism to transit systems in Japan. According to the report, the forthcoming new iPhone for the Japanese market will probably come with a built-in FeliCa chip, which will enable the handset’s users to access public transit simply by waving their handsets in front of a payment terminal. The report specifically hints that Apple is launching a new mechanism on the Japanese iPhones, to give users the ability to conveniently make payments for mass transit with their handsets --- something like an Apple Pay mobile-payment system for the subway. The FeliCa chip which Apple will reportedly build into the Japanese iPhones is already an established standard for the tap-to-pay technology currently in use in Japan. With a wide array of physical transit cards already boasting the incorporation of the FeliCa chip, the Bloomberg report indicates that Apple evidently wants the iPhone to represent those cards by storing them in the iOS Wallet app, similar to the manner in which iPhone users’ credit and debit cards are stored for the Apple Pay system.

TechRadar pro IT insights for business Search RSS News Reviews Insights TechRadar Business Laptop/PC Printers Hardware Software Mobile working Security Networks Management Data centre & Cloud News iMac 2016 release date, news and rumors iMac 2016 release date, news and rumors By Ben Stinson PC   The latest all-in-one from Apple is (hopefully) about to drop Shares Although it may seem that the range has only recently seen an upgrade, the late 2015 iMac brought little more than a processor upgrade and a long-awaited bump to Retina screens across the board. With Apple's computing market share dipping to 7.2% in Q3 2016, you would expect the company to release a new round of iMacs in time for its October event. Unfortunately, for Mac desktop fans, it appears as though the press keynote will be focused on the introduction of new MacBook Pros and MacBook Airs. The biggest updates are likely to be seen with the guts of Apple's iMac range, with Intel's latest Kaby Lake processors now ready for production. The latest AMD Polaris graphics chips should also be on-board for video editing and high-resolution gaming, though recent reports have suggested Apple is working with Nvidia this time around. Other improvements are being chattered about via the rumour mill in the expectedly feverish build up to the new iMac's release, with VR compatibility currently headlining the list of less attention-grabbing features. Keep on reading to find out more about the new developments we're expecting from the 2016 iMac refresh. Also check out: MacBook Pro 2016 release date, news and rumours Cut to the chase What is it? The latest generation of Apple's all-in-one desktop computer When is it out? Rumours suggest October 2016 What will it cost? Prices are expected to start at £899 ($1,099), as they do today iMac 2016 release date Unless Apple chooses to go big on VR at the next event, the reveal of a new iMac isn't necessarily a dead-cert. In the past, desktop Mac refreshes have been a couple of years apart, so the launch of an updated iMac could end up being delayed until WWDC 2017 in June. Still, there's plenty of new hardware for Apple to pack into its popular all-in-one PC, so it's best to stay optimistic that the Cupertino giant will unveil some other tasty new tech alongside the iPhone 7 at its special September event. Comments by AMD suggest that Apple is lined-up to launch some hardware featuring the latest Polaris graphics chipset in late 2016, but that's as close as we have to a real confirmation of an update to any of Apple's computer range. With the hiatus in improvements to Apple's Mac Pro and Mac mini, it's likely that Apple will want to keep its most popular desktop range regularly refreshed to try and claw back some of that lost market share. iMac 2016 price The existing range of iMacs starts at £899 ($1,099) for the 21.5-inch 1080p model, rising to £1,199 ($1,499) for the 4K model and £1,449 ($1,799) for the 27-inch variant. There's little doubt that Apple will stick to the existing pricing tiers, especially considering IBM's comments on the long-term affordability of Mac usage, which were introduced when the company first launched the 'cheaper' iMac back in June 2014. Will it be Intel's Kaby Lake or AMD Zen for iMac 2016? With the last iMac update, Apple skipped on Intel's Broadwell processors and went straight to the latest Skylake chips for the 2015 iteration. Intel is set to provide the latest Kaby Lake processors for the next range of iMacs, the last in Intel's 14nm processing line before the switch to Cannonlake's 10nm architecture later in 2017. Though it is likely Apple will stick with Intel's processors, there is a possibility that the new AMD Zen processor could make an appearance in the high-end 27-inch models. This very powerful new CPU features 8 cores and 16 threads that would provide users with a huge amount of processing power on tap. Of course, there's still a possibility that Apple could skip the latest array of processors and wait for the Cannonlake series before upgrading its full suite of iMacs, but this would push the launch back to sometime in the second half of next year. iMac 2016: AMD on-board with the VR-enabled future Although Apple's range of desktop PCs hasn't lagged behind rivals in the processing department, the lack of graphical grunt is more of a sore sticking point for some users, especially for those wanting to get their game on without having to switch to Windows. With VR rapidly gaining in popularity both on PC and console, it is likely that Apple will not want its loyal customer base to feel like they're being left behind. It's very realistic, then, to expect that the new range of iMacs will include AMD's Polaris graphics, which was unveiled at the beginning of 2016. Reports from WCCF Tech claim that AMD won the contract to produce two chipsets for Apple back in April, and will appear in "new desktops and notebooks from Apple, which the company plans to bring to market later this year". MacRumors thinks that Polaris 10 and 11 are the most likely fit for Apple's new range of Macs, which are built using 16nm or 14nm production processes – smaller and more power-efficient than AMD's 28nm chipsets found in existing 27-inch iMacs. The switch from Intel Iris Pro 6200 graphics in the 21.5-inch models is also highly probable, as AMD has made great gains in offering highly competitive GPUs at a very reasonable price. All in all, Mac users will be looking for plenty of power to support exciting new VR devices such as the Oculus Rift, which Palmer Luckey already said wasn't an option at present due to the underpowered graphical capabilities of Apple's computers. New flash storage for iMac 2016? While the rumours are that Apple is planning on an increased storage capacity in the iPhone 7, we're also hoping that the company makes a major move to further push flash storage with iMacs. The hybrid Fusion Drive is currently standard in the 27-inch range of iMacs and an £80 (around $105) optional extra for 21.5-inch models, though we're hoping that Apple finally makes it standard across the board with all iMacs. Flash storage capacity of up to 512GB is already available in Apple's MacBook Air and MacBook Pro, which helps them to perform noticeably faster than similarly specified iMacs. Although Apple is unlikely to go down the route of flash-only storage for iMacs, hybrid drives would be a particularly welcome upgrade. A plethora of ports for new iMacs? The last Apple MacBook refresh saw Apple eschew all other ports in favour of USB-C, and while it would be unlikely that Cupertino would reduce the connectivity in its iMacs, it's certainly plausible that the new port could make an appearance. Intel's new Kaby Lake processors offer support for USB 3.1 alongside Thunderbolt 3 and DisplayPort 1.2, which could mean that every single port on the new iMac gets a little boost.

Yesterday, Apple released a critical update for the iOS after some terrifying zero-day vulnerabilities were discovered; we would advise you to update your iPhone right away. Apparently, the highly advanced malware that lead to last night’s urgent update was created in Israel. Earlier this month at the Black Hat digital security-focused conference, the head of Apple’s security engineering, Ivan Krstic, told a spellbound audience that the secretive company was opening up its highly secure, premium branded operating systems to researchers for vulnerability report processing. In essence, Mr. Krstic announced the launch of the tech giant’s bug bounty program offering various rewards including $50,000 for discovering zero-day vulnerabilities, which let malicious exploits access to the OS’ kernel. The idea behind such bounty programs is to discover zero-day vulnerabilities – security flaws that are explored by hackers but are unknown to the company itself – in order to make the system more secured. A look from the outside by third-party researchers can offer valuable information in search of such security flaws and Apple wanted to compensate them for the effort. A week after the announcement, the iPhone-maker’s concern for such vulnerabilities turned out to be justified. An activist in the United Arab Emirates, Ahmed Mansoor, received some odd text messages on his iPhone that he later presented in front of Citizen Lab – the advanced research lab based in the Munk School of Global Affairs at the University of Toronto in Canada. Citizen Lab and Lookout, a security firm, analyzed the suspicious link in Mr. Mansoor’s text messages and discovered that clicking it could deliver a sophisticated collection of three zero-days, which could take total control of the device and spy on text messages, emails, contacts, and calls. Given the spyware’s three-headed nature that targeted Mr. Mansoor’s iPhone, the Lookout team named it “Trident.” The iOS exploit starts as an ordinary phishing attack where the attacker sends a link to the target as a click-bait. In this case, the link in the text message was apparently about how detainees are tortured in the country. The first zero-day was discovered in Safari – the default iPhone web browser – where corrupt memory vulnerability allowed hackers to execute the arbitrary code. The rest two zero-days are then downloaded to the mobile device as kernel exploits. And this can happen rather subtly; had Mr. Mansoor clicked the link, he would’ve seen Safari unexpectedly shutting down as the only indication of initiating Trident and having his device compromised. The first kernel exploit – the second zero-day – works on an information leak granting the hacker the location of the kernel in the iPhone’s memory. The kernel is a crucial component to the device’s secured booting process and Apple really prides itself on obfuscating its location in the memory. Unfortunately, this complex attack is capable of locating it. Once the kernel is located, the third zero-day comes into play, which allows the attacker to read/write data. At this stage, the iPhone is jail-broken and surveillance software can be externally deployed to collect information from the device’s applications; both third-party and Apple’s. This is indeed scary and Lookout’s security research team has also stressed on the highly sophisticated nature of this zero-day attack. On August 15, Apple was informed of the Trident vulnerabilities and within 10 days, the tech giant came out with patches for all three zero-days. An Apple spokesperson said: “We were made aware of this vulnerability and immediately fixed it with iOS 9.3.5. We advise all of our customers to always download the latest version of iOS to protect themselves against potential security exploits.” While the malware has been discovered and dealt with, one would wonder where such a highly sophisticated three zero-day combination could come from. According to Citizen Lab, the vulnerabilities came from NSO Group – a surveillance software developer based in Israel. NSO seems to have branded the zero-days as a product named Pegasus and is possibly offering such exploits for other operating systems too, such as Android. Lookout estimates that the Trident has existed as a product for nearly two years. The six year old NSO Group maintains minor presence on the Internet and keeps a low profile on purpose. According to Lookout, it focuses exclusively on exploits in the mobile space. In 2014, the founders – Omri Lavie, Shalev Hulio, and Niv Carmi – sold it for $110 million to Francisco Partners but they still seem to be running the show. The company sells its products to authorized government clients such as Mexico, Panama and also the UAE apparently. In the response statement, NSO Group distanced itself from the attack on Mr. Mansoor and denied selling its wares for illegal purposes. It wrote: “The agreements signed with the company’s customers require that the company’s products be used in a lawful manner. Specifically, the products may only be used for the prevention and investigation of crimes. The company has no knowledge of and cannot confirm the specific cases mentioned in your inquiry.” It seems like NSO Group’s products are committed to stealth and its wares have never really been caught before. Lookout estimates that the zero-day vulnerabilities could have been used to attack between 10,000 and 100,000 devices. Now, the NSO Group is being exposed and three of its creepy zero-days have been resolved. Citizen Lab and Lookout have been intrigued and want to find out more about the NSO Group. Citizen Lab has already published information on the command and control and domain structures that NSO Group’s products use. Lookout continues its research into the latest malware discovered and hints at publishing further details soon. For now, it is devising a method for iOS users to find out if their devices have been compromised. If you want to check your device, download the Lookout app to scan your device for any piece of coding with the NSO Group brand. While these three zero-days have been patched, there might be many more still out there. Thus, the iPhone maker continues its push to squeeze out vulnerabilities on its “all-secure” devices before others do.

Home News Reviews iPhone Apps Android Apps Windows Apps Top Mobiles Latest Mobiles Upcoming Mobiles PhoneRadar Explains Search PHONE FINDER COMPARE PHONES Phone News Apple to Introduce Sony’s FeliCa Technology with Apple Pay in Japan Trains Apple hasn’t gained much popularity outside of the U.S It was first introduced with iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus in 2014. The Apple Pay also works with older generation iPhones with the support of Apple Watch. Earlier this year, Apple also introduced the Apple Pay in few Asian countries including China, Singapore and Hong Kong. Until now, Apple Pay worked with NFC but in Japan, the company might opt for FeliCa technology that doesn’t require NFC chip. The FeliCa technology was developed by Sony in collaboration with NTT Docomo. Felica based mobile payment system is widespread in Japan when compared to mobile payments with NFC integrated cards. Now Apple will introduce the same FeliCa technology based Apple Pay exclusively for the Japanese market. Though there is no official confirmation, the upcoming iPhones will be the first set of Apple devices to feature the FeliCa-based Apple Pay. Rest of the world will still use the NFC-based Apple Pay which is yet to be available in India. Interestingly the FeliCa-based mobile payments will be processed faster than NFC payments as its requires banks authentication. The Apple Pay based on Felica technology will be made available first in Japanese Trains which is the major mean of transport. The company is also said to be in talks with at least one majorJapanese bank for payments. Once the deal is finalised, then the Apple Pay will work even at stores, vending machines, and even with Nintendo’s Wii U gaming console. FeliCa based payment system is widespread in Japan which has 1.9 million payments terminals. In comparison, the U.S has only 1.3 million NFC-based payment terminals while U.K has just a little over 0.3 million NFC terminals. This new payment method is expected to be introduced with the upcoming iPhone 7 & iPhone 7 Plus that will be launched next month. Few leaks also suggest the company to launch a third device called iPhone 6 SE. All these devices will be running on latest iOS 10 and will be powered Apple A10 chipset.

Apple iPhone 7 is just weeks away and based on rumors, enthusiasts along with analysts are not excited about the device. Similar reports suggested that next year’s variant will make up for this year’s model, sporting radical changes. It looks like the latter claims might just prove to be true, as multiple sources have hinted some revolutionary additions for the 2017 iPhone. A recent report suggests that it will ditch the “iconic home button.” The single button with a complete touch screen was one factor, which made iPhone stand out. With every iteration, Apple improved its functionality and made this one button capable of doing myriad of tasks. The functionality and importance of home button increased with the launch of iPhone 5s in 2013, as it supported TouchID - the fingerprint scanner. However, no matter how significant this button has been in building up the whole iPhone experience for its users; some have still hated it for acting up at times. It seems the iPhone maker has finally decided to cut the chords and put an end to problems faced by users. According to BGR, people privy to the matter have revealed that Apple plans to eliminate the home button and stretch the screen to the bottom, where this button used to be in the prior iterations of iPhones. The publication further explains that the physical button might be removed, but its functionalities will be available in the display. The screen is expected to have sensors, which will act as an invisible button. Clearly it might sound unrealistic at the moment, but similar technology is already featured in MacBooks touchpads. Despite parting ways with the button, the TouchID remains intact. It will also be implemented in the display. However, what is unknown till now is whether there will be a specific point on the screen or the whole will serve as a fingerprint scanner. All this looks dreamy and can even have drawbacks, but analysts believe Apple has its way and is ready to stun users. Subsequently, only few days ago a report was announced that speculated three new models of iPhone in 2017; one with an OLED with curved edges similar to Samsung’s Galaxy S7 Edge, whereas the other two will be usual with bezels on both sides. However, it does not shed light whether all three will ditch the button, or will just be bezel-less with curved screens. Stay tuned till we get more updates for you!

A future iPhone will include technology called FeliCa, a mobile tap-to-pay standard in Japan developed by Sony Corp., according to people familiar with the matter. The FeliCa chip will let customers in Japan store their public bus and train passes on their iPhones. Users would then be able to tap their phones against the entrance scanners instead of using physical cards. While the FeliCa chip is the standard technology underlying the service, there are several different providers of transit payment cards based on the type of transit and areas within Japan. VIDEOS TOP JOBS The Near Field Communication technology powering Apple's mobile-payments service, Apple Pay, is prevalent in North America, Europe and Australia, but the FeliCa standard dominates Japan with a penetration of 1.9 million payment terminals, according to the Bank of Japan. The terminals handled 4.6 trillion yen ($46 billion) in transactions in 2015. Last year, there were 1.3 million NFC terminals in the U.S. and 320,000 in the U.K., according to research from Let's Talk Payments and the U.K. Cards Association. Apple intends to work with multiple transit card providers, one person said. The major players there include the Suica and Pasmo networks. Theoretically, virtual representations of the transit passes would be stored in the iPhone's Wallet application, said the person, who asked not be identified because the planning is private. The card companies sell access to transit services both as-needed and via monthly packages. Apple's opportunity in Japan is significant with the country alone representing 8 percent of the company's total revenue and almost 11 percent of operating profit in the most recent quarter. Apple has planned to launch these new features with the next iPhone models, which the company is set to unveil in September, according to people familiar with the matter. However, the company could hold back the transit card feature to next year's model if discussions with the Japan-based payment networks fall apart, one person said. Apple is already at work on a major redesign of the iPhone for 2017 that focuses more heavily on the display by removing the Home button, according to a person familiar with the matter. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment. The FeliCa chip is able to process a transaction in 0.1 seconds, according to Sony. Super-swift transaction speeds are critical for adoption in the fast-paced environment of Japan's transit network, the person said. Each sale over Apple Pay currently goes through a server and requires bank approval -- which can slow the process. In addition to supporting the transit-pass network, the FeliCa chip can also store e-money, an electric form of currency now widely accepted at vending machines, convenience stores and cafes in Japan. Apple is in discussions with at least one major financial institution to support these e-money transactions, according to one of the people. Apple Pay first launched in October 2014 in the U.S. with the iPhone 6 and has since expanded to Australia, Canada, China, Hong Kong, France, Singapore, Switzerland and the U.K. Apple Pay contributes to the company's rapidly growing services business, which grew 19 percent year-over-year to about $6 billion in the fiscal third quarter. Earlier this month, Apple struck a deal with Japan-based phone carrier KDDI to allow customers to bill iTunes purchases to their phone service bill instead of directly to their credit card. Apple's deal with the Japanese carrier is indicative of Apple's payment-related negotiations with firms in Japan and follows up the company's work on activating carrier-based iTunes billing in Germany, the U.K., Russia, Switzerland, and Taiwan. In tandem with the upcoming mobile payments launch for Japan, Apple is preparing to ship mass-transit navigation support for Japan in its iPhone Maps application, the company posted on its website in July. This feature, coming in iOS 10 later this year, will allow users to find departure and arrival times for transportation across the region.   Share This Article JOIN THE DISCUSSION     Post a Comment POPULAR STORIES Utah football: Utes hire Eastern Washington playcaller Troy Taylor as offensive coordinator Utah woman has no regrets quitting Mormon Tabernacle Choir over Trump inauguration performance Salt Lake City ranked as nation's second-friendliest city Rolly: Tooele County commissioners play Santa Claus -- for themselves Bears Ears backers say work is needed to ensure designation results in protection -- not degradation ELEVATE Ririe-Woodbury to Perform ‘Wiggle-Friendly’ Family Matinée as Part of its Winter Season   Six Days and Hundreds of Reasons to Attend EVE WinterFest   Contests and Promotions COMMENTS POST A COMMENT      () News All Local News Search Last 36 hours Nation + World RSS Twitter Environment Politics Justice Polygamy Education Weather Utah's Right Elevate Empower Utah Cool Stuff The Legacy of Joe Hill I Love videos Whatever Happened To...

RACHEL LUNA, STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER Related article » More from this story SLIDE SHOW: Where you can go apple picking in Oak Glen 8 Photos » Riverside Yellow Pages THINGS TO DO     By KRISTINA HERNANDEZ / STAFF WRITER Published: Aug. 26, 2016 Updated: Aug. 28, 2016 6:01 p.m. Apple-picking season is upon us. Yes, we’ve had a blistering summer and it’s not over yet, but farm owners in Oak Glen say they’re ready to welcome their annual crop of visitors looking for farm-fresh apples. Take Los Rios Rancho, for example. The farm at 39611 Oak Glen Road recently began opening its doors to apple pickers of all ages from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Saturdays and Sundays, and there are plans for it to open up to seven days a week, based on crop availability. “We have a fantastic crop of apples this year,” Devon Riley, the farm’s operator, said by phone Thursday. “We have the largest orchard and can accommodate lots of people, and we have 33 varieties of apples to choose from, many of which come from heirloom apple trees, which are a unique variety you can’t get in stores anymore.” Apple picking is a popular activity for families and individuals looking for an inexpensive, quick getaway. But farms in Oak Glen are not limited to apples. Snow-Line Orchard & Winery at 39400 Oak Glen Road, for example, opens its raspberry farms to the public from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Wednesdays through Sundays. “We have had the warmest winter in our history, but the berries are tasting good,” Snow-Line manager Scott Hudson said. Riley said the drought led to upgrades to the irrigation system at Los Rios. “We’re doing everything we can (to water crops),” he said. “We’ve put microsprinklers in our crops so we can have enough water to go around.” Though visitors to Snow-Line may pick only raspberries, Hudson said visitors to the farm are urged to enjoy its other offerings, such as sampling its apple cider and enjoying miniature doughnuts made on the farm. “We have multiple experiences here,” Hudson added. “We’re in a building that was built in 1898 and are the fourth family to own it. We’ve been here for 36 years and have a lot of history up here.” At Los Rios, meanwhile, visitors can pick strawberries and raspberries in addition to apples. The farm also offers live music and horseback rides. “We’re making hard cider here as well,” Riley said. “We got our winery license this year, so we’re starting to do that. And you can see cider being pressed on the ‘big press’ Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays. We also have 25 different pastries every day, including pies, and we’re very well-known for our barbecue tri-tip.” A full list of shops and farms in Oak Glen is listed on the Oak Glen Apple Growers Association’s website at oakglen.net. To learn more, call Los Rios at 909-797-1005 or Snow-Line at 909-797-3415.

Mansoor was recently targeted by spyware that can hack into Apple's iPhone handset. The company said Thursday it was updating its security. The text message reads: "New secrets on the torture of Emirati citizens in jail." (jon gambrell/Associated Press) By Tim Johnson, McClatchy Washington Bureau (TNS) Published: August 26, 2016, 10:47 PM A   A WASHINGTON — Mexican investigative journalist Rafael Cabrera didn’t take the bait. Mysterious text messages would pop into his iPhone but he refrained from clicking on the links they contained. It saved his phone from turning into a surveillance tool, a digital ankle bracelet transmitting his every move, email and contact list entry. Cabrera’s caution served him well, but the spyware scandal that rocked Apple this week brought only bad news for dissidents, human rights activists, investigative journalists and others in the sights of repressive or meddlesome governments. Their cellular phones are potentially their worst enemies. Cyber experts revealed this week that an Israeli company, NSO Group, had created spyware that allowed remote operators to seize virtual control of iPhones and iPads, listening to all conversations, intercepting all data and activating the cameras and microphones at will. Apple reacted quickly, offering security updates to address the vulnerabilities. Owners of the estimated 1 billion Apple devices running the iOS operating system have only to download the patches onto their devices. But experts say sophisticated spyware can now be put in the hands of leaders of even the most backwater nations. NSO Group, which was formed in Herzliya, near Tel Aviv, in 2010, has done business in Mexico, Panama and the United Arab Emirates. It also retains internet domains in Turkey, Thailand, Qatar, Kenya, Uzbekistan, Mozambique, Morocco, Yemen, Hungary, Saudi Arabia, Nigeria and Bahrain, according to peerlyst.com, a portal for information security professionals. The company is a pillar in the industry of “lawful intercept” software that is prized by government agencies whose task it is to maintain stability, combat crime and fight terrorism. Such surveillance software is expensive, higher than $1 million, but for governments the capabilities that it brings make it a bargain. “It’s pocket change for a government entity,” said Eva Galperin, global policy analyst for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit in San Francisco that champions free expression and civil liberties in the digital world.   “The defense ‘while it’s legal’ is actually very weak. The United Arab Emirates does not treat its dissidents very well,” Galperin said. “If you are selling lawful intercept software to the UAE, you have to know that it will not be used to send milk and cookies to the targets.” Cabrera, the Mexican journalist, works for a digital news portal, Aristegui Online, that has been a perpetual thorn in the side of President Enrique Pena Nieto, leader of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, which has an authoritarian past. The site first rankled Pena Nieto when it reported in 2014 that a $7 million mansion had been built by a major government contractor to the design specifications of the first lady. Earlier this year, the site, reporting in tandem with McClatchy, revealed that the contractor had sought to hide $100 million in assets in offshore companies. Last weekend, Aristegui Online reported that nearly 29 percent of Pena Nieto’s 1991 undergraduate law thesis had been plagiarized. Cabrera began getting text messages on his iPhone in mid-2015, and as time went on the messages became increasingly personal in their quest to have him click on a link to infect his phone. “The links for Cabrera, the only word I can put on it is diabolical, as clever as they were evil,” said Geoffrey King, a lawyer and technology program coordinator for the Committee to Protect Journalists, a group that promotes press freedom worldwide. The first messages made mention of the “white house” scandal involving the first lady. One said that those behind the Aristegui report would be sued for defamation, and a second one said the reporters might be jailed while an investigation unfolded. Both spoofed an address for a new television network. Both ended with a hyperlink. Other, later text messages addressed Cabrera by his nickname, Rafa, he said, and mentioned that he owed money on his cellular account or offered a credit with the Uber ride-sharing service. An additional text was disconcerting and needling. “It was quite vulgar. It asked if I wanted to see my partner having sex with another person,” Cabrera said, noting that a link would lead to the supposed video. “Clicking on any one of these (links) would have been game over,” King said. Cabrera said he wasn’t the only member of the Aristegui Online team to receive such baited messages. No one knows for sure who was behind the surveillance gambit. But one expert said he thought the NSO Group surveillance spyware had been sold to governments all over the world. Lookout, a San Francisco cyber-forensics company that took part in uncovering the NSO spyware, said in a report Thursday that NSO Group had been sold to a private equity company, Francisco Partners, for $110 million in 2014. “Given that kind of high valuation, it’s highly likely . that it’s in very wide use around the world,” said Edin Omanovic, a research officer at Privacy International, a charity in London that opposes unlawful and intrusive surveillance. The spyware allows an attacker to take complete control of an iPhone or iPad if the user clicks just once. The infected device gives no indication that anything has gone astray. Once the iPad or iPhone is infected, the attacker can observe and control all activity on the device. The researchers who discovered the spyware found that it had three chains of what are called zero-day exploits, major vulnerabilities that are so named because once discovered they give the software engineers zero days to fix it. The problem is immediate. Uncovering such flaws in coding tends “to be very expensive and very rare, particularly for Apple because Apple is very good at security,” said King of the Committee to Protect Journalists. Journalists, dissidents and others who may run afoul of governments should not give up using Apple devices if they can afford them, King said, noting that once a security update is downloaded the devices appear to be safe again. In addition to Mexico, it is known that Panama bought surveillance equipment from NSO Group for $6 million to $8 million. President Ricardo Martinelli’s administration bought surveillance platforms during his 2009-14 term to intercept cellular phones. The resulting espionage scandal, in which 150 of Martinelli’s political opponents were targeted, led Martinelli to flee Panama early last year. A high court judge ordered his arrest last December, but his whereabouts are not known. The use of sophisticated spyware for cellular phones may prove in the future to be simply too tempting for many national leaders to resist. “We’re talking about petty grudges, it seems, by governments. It’s frightening,” King said.

And now with major design changes slated to be introduced in the following year, a latest Bloomberg report now suggest that Cupertino is planning an exclusive new technological feature just for Japan. This feature will enable Japanese iPhone users to pay for subway or mass-transit rides with their smartphones instead of physical payment cards. The tech giant operates its massively popular Apple Pay mobile payments service in numerous parts of the world, excluding Japan due to technological challenges. It uses near-field communication (NFC) technology to let users pay using their phones at point-of-sale systems. Whereas NFC, if you’re unaware, is not the prominent contact-less technology used in Japan and Apple is planning to adapt to it. To enable Apple Pay in Japan it will include FeliCa technology that will enable users to store their public bus and train passes on their iPhones. If sources are to be believed then the virtual representation of the transit cards will be stored in the users wallet application. The plan is currently in private and in very early stages, says one of the anonymous sources. FeliCa, a mobile tap-to-pay technology developed by Sony Corp., will be the underlying technology required to power this service. Apple is thinking of integrating the FeliCa chips(based on the open NFC-F standards) into their Japanese models because Sony’s technology is more popular in the country. Currently, over 1.9 million payment terminals are said to be powered by the aforementioned technology. There are certain to be multiple service providers of payment cards based on the type of transit and areas within Japan. Thus, sources believe that Apple’s aim is to work with multiple transit card providers, starting with major players like Suica and Pasmo networks. These companies sell transit services to users both as-and-when needed and in the form of monthly packages. Also, this would Cupertino further boost its withering sales in the Asia-Pacific region. Japan already accounts for almost 8 per cent of the company’s total revenue and 11 per cent of the total operating profit in the recent quarter.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) music streaming service is turning into a pretty big win for the company and Apple services is turning into a giant. STORY: START WITH MUSIC Apple Inc. introduced its music streaming service a year ago and it was simple. Pay $10, get your music on. It entered an industry with some larger players, like Pandora and most famously Spotify, which at the time had 24 million subscribers. As of today, an estimate from MIDiA Research estimates puts Apple Music at a staggering 16 million paying subscribers, already. While there's a story to be told around Apple's strategy to get in nice and close with some music's greatest stars, the real story surrounds the success that the company has driven in just a year, the success it may now bring with new deals, and further, the success it is driving in its broader Apple Services segment. SUCCESS: SERVICES Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) found success by using its greatest asset of them all -- its existing iPhone install base. Whether new iPhone sales slow, or even shrink, the install base of the iPhone is growing. That collection of people gives Apple an incredible advantage in selling services like Apple Pay, Apple Music, and others. Here's a chart from a Bloomberg article which plots the impressive growth in Apple Music -- but also gives us time for pause. Source: Bloomberg This isn't an Apple Music story, it's an Apple Services story. Tim Cook so eloquently put it on the last earnings call when he said that Apple Services in and of itself will be large enough to be a Fortune 100 company by next year. That's impressive considering Apple Services only makes up about 14% of total Apple Inc. revenue. For some context, here is a chart of services revenue and a little tidbit about Facebook. We can see that Apple Inc. services is larger than all of Facebook's revenue. Now, that will change by next year, as Facebook is still seeing 50% growth rates while Apple Services will grow at a slower pace, but the point is, 14% of Apple's business is the size of Facebook. It's happening – Apple is diversifying. Here's a better image of the trend: Services never made up more than 12% of Apple's revenue, now it stands at 14%. Certainly the shrinking iPhone sales have made the comparison a little easier for services, but in general, the trend is higher, and it's only the beginning. Apple Pay is a booming business. At its core, Apple Pay is a mobile payment application – swipe your phone and Pay. That little piece is in and of itself rather genius in that it ends the need for credit cards and passwords while adding convenience and security. The trend is astonishing, in general for mobile Pay: Even better, Apple announced that it would bring Apple Pay first to mobile e-commerce sites, and then to the broader web. For any Apple product owner, whether it be an iPhone, iPad, iMac, MacBook or other computing device, a purchase online, mobile or otherwise, has become as simple as touching the screen. Apple has turned our fingerprints into our credit cards, PayPal accounts, debit cards and cash. It is, effectively, the "password killer." We could go on and on with Apple pays explosive adoption in China and on to other Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) services, but the point is more easily drawn out in one sentence: Apple is turning its install base into a gigantic services company that will grow independently of iPhone sales. That is the bullish thesis for Apple. The rapid success of Apple Music is yet another empirical data point. Next up for Apple is augmented reality (patent filed), Social media (patent filed) and medical technology services (patent filed). To really understand Apple, beyond the headlines, we encourage you to try CML Pro where we divulge not only the patent filing and the context, but also the smaller known gems that will power these revolutionary themes that Apple, Google, Amazon and Facebook are chasing down. The author is long Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares. WHY THIS MATTERS There's so much going on with Apple, Google and Facebook that it's nearly impossible to keep up with. But the real gems are the smaller companies that will power the technological revolutions that these three giants will get behind. These are the companies that win, no matter which of the big three own a market. It's identifying trends and companies like this this that allows us to find the 'next Apple' or the 'next Google.'

Researchers at Lookout mobile security firm and Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto said they uncovered a fierce, three-pronged cyber attack targeting a dissident’s iPhone “that subverts even Apple’s strong security environment.” Lookout and Citizen Lab worked with Apple on an iOS patch to defend against what was called “Trident” because of its triad of attack methods, the researchers said in a joint blog post. “We were made aware of this vulnerability and immediately fixed it with iOS 9.3.5,” Apple said in a released statement. Trident is used in spyware referred to as Pegasus, which a Citizen Lab investigation showed was made by an Israel-based organization called NSO Group. It was acquired by the US firm Francisco Partners Management six years ago, according to Lookout and Citizen. Lookout referred to Pegasus as the most sophisticated attack it has seen, sneakily accessing calls, cameras, email, passwords, apps and more on iPhones. The spyware was detected when used against Ahmed Mansoor, a human rights activist in the United Arab Emirates, who has been repeatedly targeted using spyware. – Phishing scheme – After receiving a suspicious text with a link, he reported the matter to Citizen Lab, which worked in conjunction with San Francisco-based Lookout to research the affair. “The attack sequence, boiled down, is a classic phishing scheme: send text message, open web browser, load page, exploit vulnerabilities, install persistent software to gather information,” the joint blog post said. “This, however, happens invisibly and silently, such that victims do not know they’ve been compromised.” Mansoor received text messages on August 10 and 11 promising that secrets about detainees being tortured in UAE jails could be accessed by clicking on an enclosed link, researchers said. Had he fallen for the ruse, the Trident chain of “zero-day exploits” would have broken into his iPhone and installed snooping software. Once infected, Mansoor’s iPhone would have been turned into a “spy in his pocket” capable of tracking his whereabouts and conversations, Citizen Lab said. Mansoor was targeted five years ago with FinFisher spyware and again the following year with Hacking Team spyware, according to Citizen Lab research. “The use of such expensive tools against Mansoor shows the lengths that governments are willing to go to target activists,” the researchers said. Although the cyber attack on Mansoor was not linked to a specific government, Citizen Lab said indicators pointed to the UAE. UAE authorities did not comment on the matter. Lookout and Citizen believe the spyware has been “in the wild for a significant amount of time.” “It is also being used to attack high-value targets for multiple purposes, including high-level corporate espionage on iOS, Android and Blackberry.” Citizen Lab has also found evidence that “state-sponsored actors” used NSO weapons against a Mexican journalist who reported on high-level corruption in that country and on an unknown target in Kenya. The NSO tactics included impersonating sites such as the International Committee of the Red Cross, the British government’s visa application processing website, and a wide range of news organizations and major technology companies, the researchers said. – Cyber arms dealers – Mansoor’s decision to enlist Citizen Lab instead of falling into the trap gave researchers a rare chance to expose the work of “shady cyber arms dealers” who command high prices for morally questionable services, Lookout vice president of security research Mike Murray told AFP. Invoices posted online have shown that hackers can charge tens of thousands of dollars per target hit with their software. “The smartphone is a valuable target, and breaking into it is a valuable skill set,” Murray said. “People who can do this, and with wiggle room in their moral code, have realized the business opportunity.” NSO Group has been around since 2010 and the capture of one of its weapons was billed as a first. Studying Trident has helped cyber defenders find ways to spot spyware that had been operating unseen, and they are “actively catching it in the wild now,” Murray said. He declined to reveal anything about other targets, saying that they were people likely to be under surveillance in other ways by local authorities. Citizen Lab saw the attack on Mansoor as further evidence that “lawful intercept” spyware has significant abuse potential, and that some governments can’t resist the temptation to use such tools against political opponents, journalists and human rights defenders.

A future iPhone will include technology called FeliCa, a mobile tap-to-pay standard in Japan developed by Sony Corp., according to people familiar with the matter. The FeliCa chip will let customers in Japan store their public bus and train passes on their iPhones. Users would then be able to tap their phones against the gate scanners instead of using physical cards. While the FeliCa chip is the standard technology underlying the service, there are several different providers of transit payment cards based on the type of transit and areas within Japan. The Near Field Communication technology powering Apple’s mobile-payments service, Apple Pay, is prevalent in North America, Europe and Australia, but the FeliCa standard dominates Japan with a penetration of 1.9 million payment terminals, according to the Bank of Japan. The terminals handled ¥4.6 trillion in transactions in 2015. Last year, there were 1.3 million NFC terminals in the U.S. and 320,000 in the U.K., according to research from Let’s Talk Payments and the U.K. Cards Association. Apple intends to work with multiple transit card providers, one person said. The major players there include the Suica and Pasmo networks. Theoretically, virtual representations of the transit passes would be stored in the iPhone’s Wallet application, said the person, who asked not be identified because the planning is private. The card companies sell access to transit services both as needed and via monthly packages. Apple’s opportunity in Japan is significant, with the country alone representing 8 percent of the company’s total revenue and almost 11 percent of operating profit in the most recent quarter. Apple has planned to launch these new features with the next iPhone models, which the company is set to unveil in September, according to people familiar with the matter. However, the company could hold back the transit card feature to next year’s model if discussions with the Japan-based payment networks fall apart, one person said. Apple is already at work on a major redesign of the iPhone for 2017 that focuses more heavily on the display by removing the Home button, according to a person familiar with the matter. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment. The FeliCa chip is able to process a transaction in 0.1 seconds, according to Sony. Super-swift transaction speeds are critical for adoption in the fast-paced environment of Japan’s transit network, the person said. Each sale over Apple Pay currently goes through a server and requires bank approval — which can slow the process. In addition to supporting the transit-pass network, the FeliCa chip can also store e-money, an electric form of currency now widely accepted at vending machines, convenience stores and cafes in Japan. Apple is in discussions with at least one major financial institution to support e-money transactions, according to one of the people. Apple Pay first launched in October 2014 in the U.S. with the iPhone 6 and has since expanded to Australia, Canada, China, Hong Kong, France, Singapore, Switzerland and the U.K. Apple Pay contributes to its rapidly growing services business, which grew 19 percent year-over-year to about $6 billion in the fiscal third quarter. Earlier this month, Apple struck a deal with KDDI to allow customers to bill iTunes purchases to their phone service bill instead of directly to their credit card. Apple’s deal with the carrier is indicative of Apple’s payment-related talks with firms in Japan and follows up its work on activating carrier-based iTunes billing in Germany, the U.K., Russia, Switzerland, and Taiwan. In tandem with the mobile payments launch, Apple is preparing to ship mass-transit navigation support for Japan in its iPhone Maps application, it said on its website in July. This feature, coming in iOS 10 later this year, lets users find departure and arrival times for transportation across the region.

The report alleges that labor conditions at Pegatron, a Taiwanese contract manufacturer and Apple supplier, has declined over the past year. As per Apple’s existing policy, supply chain workers are prohibited from working over 60 hours a week and are mandated to receive at least one day off per week. But the China Labor Watch interviewed workers at Pegatron’s Shanghai factory reviewed pay stubs to find ”excessive and illegal” overtime work to be rampant within the company. In March 2016, 62 percent of employees worked more than 100 hours of overtime and one worker, in particular, clocked in 109 hours of overtime. A violation of overtime policies is not limited to employees, as the nonprofit group also found student interns illegally work, on average, 80 hours of overtime per month. The report cites low wages as a reason for why workers are opting to work overtime. Despite a rise in minimum wage—from $304 a month to $330 a month—workers received less wages. By reviewing the pay stubs, the China Labor Watch claims Pegatron changed bonus structures and lowered social insurance, resulting in lower wages. After deductions, Pegatrong workers bring home about $213. Related Stories Apple Supplier Pegatron In Trouble Again Apple Responds To Chinese Labor Violations Claims “Working conditions are terrible, and workers are subject to terrible treatment,” writes the New York-based nonprofit in the report. “Currently, Apple’s profits are declining, and the effects of this decline have been passed on to suppliers. To mitigate the impact, Pegatron has taken some covert measures to exploit workers.” Since becoming CEO, Tim Cook has vocalized his dedication to improving worker conditions. “Apple takes working conditions very seriously,” said Cook at the 2012 Goldman Sachs Technology and Internet Conference. “We take the conditions of workers very seriously. I worked in factories, I worked at a paper mill. We understand working conditions at a very granular level.” Despite making changes, implementing policy has proven to be difficult for the California-based tech giant. In 2012, The New York Times highlighted the human cost of working in an Apple supplier’s factory and in 2014, a BBC investigation spotlighted poor working conditions. Prior to publishing the new report, China Labor Watch gave Apple the opportunity to respond. The tech giant “admitted that in some production departments of Pegatron, excessive overtime did exist, but the percentage of overtime violation was lower than [China Labor Watch’s] statistics.” Most Read Everything You Need To Know, Right Now.

There have been a lot of groundbreaking tech products over the past 10 years. The iPhone is one, and the Surface Pro is another. But even Apple and Microsoft can screw up at times and fall behind the tech game. However, it doesn’t take a big-name tech company to make a product flop. Here is a list of the five biggest tech gadget failures of the past 10 years. 5. Apple Watch (2015) The Apple Watch isn’t as big of a tech failure as the other items on this list. But it is just as much of a failure when we talk about the expectations that the Watch failed to live up to. The Apple Watch is enjoyed by some, but considered the beginning of Apple’s downfall by others. Even though CNET gave the Watch three-and-a-half stars, it was a rating that was lower than any other Apple product during the past year. “The Apple Watch is the most ambitious, well-constructed smartwatch ever seen, but first-gen shortfalls make it feel more like a fashionable toy than a necessary tool. That may change with a big software update later this year, though.” One of the biggest shortfalls that helped make the Watch such a tech failure is its dismal battery life. Let’s hope the Apple Watch 2 can make us forget about Apple’s most recent letdown. 4. Palm Pre (2009) In 2009, Sprint thought they had a smartphone to compete against the iPhone (AT&T had exclusivity with Apple until 2011) and would rule the tech world. The Palm Pre caused a lot of excitement. However, after the Palm Pre was released in June of 2009, it became one of the most botched smartphone launches ever. Many customers had to return their Palm Pre devices several times due to multiple dead pixels, easy screen cracks, dead batteries, and just about everything else. Palm was soon purchased by HP after the major smartphone failure. 3. Blackberry Playbook (2011) RIM had everybody drooling at CES with their new tablet, the Blackberry Playbook. At the time, it had a better screen than the iPad and appeared to be an amazing multimedia device. There was one huge flaw in the Playbook when it was released in April of 2011 — the software wasn’t ready! It was like taking a half-cooked pizza out of the oven, taking it out, and trying to enjoy it. The review from Infoworld in April of 2011 was horrible. “This week, RIM began shipping the 7-inch tablet. After spending a couple days with the final product, it’s clear that the PlayBook is a useless device whose development is unfinished.” The review added that the Playbook was even worse than the worst tablets. Soon after this tech failure, the Blackberry Playbook was put on sale for very cheap prices, and it still couldn’t walk off shelves. 2. Samsung Q1 UMPC (2006) Before Samsung had major tech successes with their Galaxy line of smartphones and their curved HD television sets, they had plenty of failures. One of those was the first Ultra-Mobile PC (UMPC) that hit the market in May of 2006, the Q1. The idea was that if you put a full Windows desktop PC in the shape of a seven-inch tablet, people would go crazy. Those who bought it did go crazy, but not in the way Samsung or Microsoft expected. The battery life was awful, and using desktop apps on a 7-inch device proved to be a daunting task. Apple learned from the UMPC tech failure and put a mobile operating system on the iPad in 2010. 1. Microsoft Zune (2006) In 2006, Microsoft decided to take on the iPod (bad idea!) and came up with a similar product called the Zune. The product became such a spectacular failure that in the tech world, when companies say they don’t want to ruin a product, they say, “Don’t Zune it!” It wasn’t that the hardware was so bad, but it wasn’t what it needed to be — unique. The fact that barely any record labels got on board with Microsoft was its true Achilles heel. The product actually improved within the next couple years. By 2009, the Zune HD was one of the best multimedia players around. Unfortunately, the fire had already burned, and it was too late to save the Zune, which — in some circles — is known as the biggest tech product failure in history.

X The cyber hack that could swing the US election ‘The bizarre has almost become the norm in US politics this past year’ Sat, Aug 27, 2016, 05:00 Updated: Sat, Aug 27, 2016, 09:35 Gillian Tett This summer, the Democratic National Committee revealed it had suffered a cyber attack and many confidential internal documents had been stolen. Photograph: Getty Images         Is there anything that might cause Donald Trump to win the US presidential election? That’s the question political pundits are asking obsessively these days as the main parties’ campaigns take increasingly unpredictable turns. A month ago Trump was almost level with Hillary Clinton in the polls but, since then, a series of gaffes has caused his numbers to slide. This week, for example, an IBT poll suggests Clinton now has a 12-point lead. While this might indicate that the Democrats are cruising for victory, the election has been so uncertain in recent months that nobody dares take anything for granted. So what might suddenly cause momentum to swing again? To my mind, there are at least three factors to watch. The most obvious is that Trump himself implements a change of course, becoming much more professional and effective in running his campaign. That is hard to believe right now but the key person to watch is Kellyanne Conway, a pollster recently brought in to serve as campaign manager. Highly respected in Republican circles and regarded as a very effective operator, she might just possibly end up turning the campaign around. A second factor is whether a nasty external shock occurs. Trump, after all, is a candidate whose campaign is built on stoking up fear, in the mould of former president Richard Nixon. Trump hints gun owners ‘could do something’ to Clinton’s plan Donald Trump unfit for presidency, says Barack Obama Anger grips Republican convention as Cruz snubs Trump If, God forbid, a big terrorist attack occurs - or something else that causes panic - this might play into Trump’s hands, particularly if his campaign had already shifted momentum under Conway. However, there is a third possibility that has gained less attention: cyber hacking. This summer, the Democratic National Committee revealed it had suffered a cyber attack and that many confidential internal documents had been stolen. CrowdStrike, the cyber security group employed by the DNC, said the culprits were Russia’s intelligence services. ADVERTISEMENT This was denied by Moscow, but backed up by other cyber security groups such as Mandiant and Fidelis Cybersecurity. This is a bizarre turn of events, by any standards, not least because some 20,000 internal DNC emails have now been released via WikiLeaks and a blogging site called Guccifer 2.0. But matters may get worse. CrowdStrike says one Russian hacking group, given the nickname Cozy Bear, was in the DNC system for at least a year. It is unclear what material has been taken but cyber experts believe Cozy Bear holds extensive secret documents, including confidential memos detailing the negative traits of Democratic candidates in this year’s US elections. (It is standard practice for campaign managers to try to assemble all the dirt on their own candidates in advance, so they are prepared in case their opponents try to attack them.) If this is true — like almost everything else in the cyber security sphere, very little can be conclusively proved — it seems that only a small portion of the sensitive material has emerged. So it is possible that the hackers will leak this in the coming months, in a targeted way, trying to cause maximum damage. This week, for example, Guccifer 2.0 leaked data about the tactics that the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee used in House races in Pennsylvania. This is the first time the hackers have tried to shape momentum in a local race. And if these leaks accelerate, they might stoke up more anti-Clinton feeling, particularly given the separate controversies surrounding Clinton’s personal email server. Or so the gossip goes. On one level, this theory sounds almost fantastical and it is entirely possible that speculation will die away in a few months and that Clinton will romp to victory. But the very fact that Washington is abuzz with these rumours right now illustrates two key points. First, just how strange this current election campaign has become on both sides and, second, the degree to which the bizarre has almost become the norm in US politics this past year. In this election we face a world of James Bond meets Alice in Wonderland, where political boundaries are stealthily shifting, day-by-day. Stand by for more surprises — from Cozy Bear, or anyone else.

Investigators discovered that a company called the NSO Group, an Israeli outfit that sells software that invisibly tracks a target's mobile phone, was responsible for the intrusions. The NSO Group's software can read text messages and emails and track calls and contacts. It can even record sounds, collect passwords and trace the whereabouts of the phone user. In response, Apple yesterday released a patched version of its mobile software, iOS 9.3.5. Users can get the patch through a normal software update. Apple fixed the holes 10 days after a tip from two researchers, Bill Marczak and John Scott Railton, at Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto's Munk School of Global Affairs, and Lookout, a San Francisco mobile security company. "We advise all of our customers to always download the latest version of iOS to protect themselves against potential security exploits," said Fred Sainz, a company spokesperson. In interviews and manuals, the NSO Group's executives have long boasted that their spyware worked like a "ghost", tracking the moves and keystrokes of its targets, without leaving a trace. But until this month, it was not clear how exactly the group was monitoring its targets, or who exactly it was monitoring. A clearer picture began to emerge on August 10, when Ahmed Mansoor, a prominent human rights activist in the UAE, who has been tracked by surveillance software several times, began receiving suspicious text messages. Zamir Dahbash, an NSO Group spokesperson, said in an email: "The company sells only to authorized governmental agencies, and fully complies with strict export control laws and regulations."

Early Apple computer sells at auction for $815,000 Fortune 8/26/2016 Don Reisinger © Provided by Fortune unspecified-6 One of the first Apple computers ever built has sold for $815,000. Glenn and Shannon Dellimore, co-founders of beauty product firm Glamglow, bought the Apple I computer, possibly the first model of its kind in 1976, in an online auction. They won after a bid exceeding its estimated value of $1 million--the original price estimate by historians--was entered but then withdrawn. In an interview with Fortune, Apple historian and Apple I expert Corey Cohen said that he, along with help from Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak and Apple’s 12th employee Daniel Kottke, were able to date the computer to the summer of 1976, making it among the first Apple I machines ever produced--if not the first. They identified Kottke’s handwriting on the cassette tape that runs the computer’s operating system. Considering that Kottke worked for Apple just after its founding in 1976 during his college summer break, they realized the computer was among the company’s earliest units. Cohen believes there are approximately 60 to 70 Apple I computers still in existence and countless replicas that, according to Cohen, only a handful of Apple historians can identify as fakes. Some could argue that the Dellimores walked off with a deal. The Apple I they acquired was valued at $1 million based on special features that aren’t included in others, including components that Cohen believes Apple co-founder Steve Jobs himself tested to reduce the computer’s costs. "There were some odd experiments on the board that someone like Steve Jobs or one of the Apple folks would have done," Cohen said. "It's not something that would've been done by a hardware hacker back in the day." The computer is essentially a board with components that allowed users to perform basic functions like word processing. It was previously used to build a Spanish language program to help users learn how to speak Spanish. In 2014, The Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, MI bought an Apple I computer in outstanding condition for $905,000. Considering that price and the latest Apple I’s unique attributes, Cohen thought the latest computer sold should go for more. “That unit didn't have the provenance that this board has," Cohen said of the Apple I that The Henry Ford Museum bought. "This Apple I is a unicorn." Looking ahead, the Dellimores plan not only to keep the Apple I as an investment, but also share it with museums and universities to educate the community about its “place in history.” The couple sold their company to Estee Lauder in 2015 for an undisclosed amount.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Mail Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple Report: Spotify punishes artists who give exclusives to Apple Music Yoni Heisler •August 27, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share With Apple working overtime in an effort to attract new subscribers to Apple Music, and steal away users from Spotify in the process, the company has doubled down on artist exclusives as a marketing strategy. Over the past few months, Apple has successfully managed to convince a number of big name artists like Drake and Frank Ocean to release new albums exclusively on Apple Music. Predictably, Spotify isn’t a fan of Apple’s business strategy and has reportedly begun retaliating against artists who opt to release exclusives on Apple Music. According to a recent report from Bloomberg, artists who get into bed with Apple may discover that their content becomes harder for users to find on Spotify. DON’T MISS: Does it even matter that last year’s iPhone 6s is so much faster than the new Galaxy Note 7? Bloomberg's report reads in part: Spotify has been retaliating against musicians who introduce new material exclusively on rival Apple Music by making their songs harder to find, according to people familiar with the strategy. Artists who have given Apple exclusive access to new music have been told they won’t be able to get their tracks on featured playlists once the songs become available on Spotify, said the people, who declined to be identified discussing the steps. Those artists have also found their songs buried in the search rankings of Spotify, the world’s largest music-streaming service, the people said. Spotify’s strategy has reportedly been in-place for about a year but it’s unclear if it’s had any discernible effect. If anything, the big name artists likely to release exclusives on Apple Music are hardly the type of artists who need any sort of promotional push from Spotify. What’s more, I’ve noticed that when Apple Music exclusives finally make their way to Spotify, such content immediately skyrockets to the top of the Spotify charts. In other words, prominent placement and cash from Apple may ultimately outweigh whatever type of punishment Spotify is capable of handing down. The larger takeaway here is that the tension between Spotify and Apple has been heating up for some time and may continue to escalate in the months ahead. Interestingly enough, the recent release of Frank Ocean’s new album as an Apple Music exclusive prompted Universal Music Group CEO Lucian Grange to declare that Universal artists will no longer be allowed to release exclusives on any particular streaming service.

Home > News > Frank Ocean's "Blonde" Illegally Downloaded Over 750,000 Times Frank Ocean's "Blonde" Illegally Downloaded Over 750,000 Times 3131 99 31K Posted by Angus Walker, Aug 26, 2016 at 07:18pm SWIPE Despite its Apple exclusivity, Frank Ocean's "Blonde" has been an easy find for Internet pirates. The first-week predictions for Frank Ocean's Blonde were just revealed, and he's set to take the No. 1 spot by a long shot, as the album is expected to move 225-250k in equivalent album units. That's not to mention the entirely separate "visual album," entitled Endless, that he put out the day before. While an audio version of Endless is not yet available, Blonde was exclusively released on iTunes as an album-only purchase (no individual tracks) and for streaming via Apple Music. Much of the album's first-week sales figures will have been generated through its streaming numbers, which have become an increasingly dominant factor in tracking album sales, especially with streaming exclusives like VIEWS and The Life of Pablo.  While streaming is up and traditional album purchases are down, it seems that a lot of fans are still readily downloading high-profile releases illegally. Not just those with Apple Music have been able to acquire Blonde. In fact, Music Business Worldwide reports that as of 7AM EST on Thurs. (Aug. 25), Blonde had been illegally downloaded 753,849 times.  Music Business Worldwide generated the above numbers via the anti-piracy company MUSO, which only tracked downloads of Blonde in its entirety and not of individual tracks, reports Complex.  Two days after Kanye West dropped his February album The Life of Pablo, released as a Tidal exclusive, it was reported that the album had already been illegally downloaded over 500,000 times. It's looking like streaming exclusives are being countered with rampant piracy. In any case, it appears there is still a huge component of the listening audience opposed to the dominance that a few streaming platforms have exercised over the releases of mainstream music, and at this point, they've found ways to get their hands on the most in-demand projects for free.  Tags: News, Frank Ocean, blonde, Industry, apple, apple music, streaming, piracy, illegal download A Song-By-Song Guide To Young Thug's "No, My Name Is Jeffery" Staff Picks Playlist (August 26) RELATED & TRENDING ARTICLES Hottest Music Videos of 2016 Check Out The Full Credits For Frank Ocean's "Blonde" Legendary Prankster Changes Hollywood Sign To Read "Hollyweed" Frank Ocean's "Blonde" (Review) Hottest 50 Songs Of 2016 YG Posts Kendall Jenner Photo To Start 2017 Def Jam Reportedly Released Frank Ocean From Contract Early Amber Rose Lets Her Nipple Go Free Travis Scott Kicks DJ Off Stage For Sucking Drake & Jennifer Lopez Share A Kiss, Preview New Collaboration Birdman's New Artist Buys Audi While Lil Wayne Still Waiting To Get Paid By Cash Money Nicki Minaj Posts Video Of Fan Asking The Rapper To Sign Her Tits Twitter Reacts To Desiigner's Bizarre New Haircut Chance The Rapper Finally Lets The World See His Daughter Kensli Nick Cannon Says He Dissed Eminem Because He's Fearless Here’s A Juicy Report (& Rumor) About Beyonce & Jay Z Cutting Ties With Kanye & Kim Frank Ocean's "Blonde" Illegally Downloaded Over 750,000 Times By Angus Walker Angus Walker @gowangus Follow Posted Aug 26, 2016 at 07:18pm 30,999 Views 99 Comments 3131 Despite its Apple exclusivity, Frank Ocean's "Blonde" has been an easy find for Internet pirates.

PREGNANCY BABY TODDLER BIG KID TEEN EDUCATION SPED KIDS WELLNESS FAMILY LIFE CELEBRITY MOMS Daddy iOS 9.3.5 Now Available For iPhones; Apple Advises Immediate Update To Patch Security Issues By Charles Andrews, Parent Herald August 26, 09:49 pm TAG apple, iphone, iPhone 6, iPhone 7, iOS, ios 9.3.5, iOS 10, smartphone Apple iPhone users have recently been the victims of dangerous security breaches made by a mysterious cyber-hacking group, and as a response, Apple has recently released the all-new iOS 9.3.5, which has made all the necessary fixes to ensure the safety of all iPhone devices. While most software updates really don't offer major significant changes, Apple users aren't too keen on updating their products as frequently as they should, but now people who use iPhones are told that upgrading to iOS 9.3.5 is essential for security reasons. According to a report from The New York Times, an Israeli-based digital arms group has recently been hacking into Apple products, taking advantage of vulnerabilities in the iPhone's software's security. The entity called the "NSO Group" have been using their own software to spy on journalists and notable dissidents. With it, the NSO Group are able to read text messages and emails, record sounds, and even monitor the iPhone user to track their whereabouts. This is certainly a cause for alarm, as the users have no knowledge that they are being watched and followed. The shadowy NSO Group have long boasted that their tracking software "worked like a ghost" and cannot be traced. In a response to the security dilemma, Apple has released the late operating software for the iPhone, iOS 9.3.5. Finder states that the new software will fix the issues that could lead to the malfunctioning of the system's operating kernel, memory corruption, and the possibility of the execution of arbitrary code by malicious websites on the device. Upgrading to iOS 9.3.5 heightens the security of the iPhone, basically. With the release of the iPhone 7 which will run on the latest iOS 10 software coming soon, it is still imperative for users to update to the iOS 9.3.5 to ensure safety while waiting for the newer version to become available. © 2016 ParentHerald.com All rights reserved.

Human rights lawyer… iPhone could be hacked with one tap. Human rights lawyer alerted security researchers Friday, 26 August 2016, 14:37 Last update: about 5 months ago <a href='http://ads.independent.com.mt/www/delivery/ck.php?n=afef72b0&amp;cb=93' target='_blank'><img data-src='http://ads.independent.com.mt/www/delivery/avw.php?zoneid=22&amp;cb=93&amp;n=afef72b0' border='0' alt='' /></a> Flaws in Apple's iOS operating system have been discovered that made it possible to install spyware on a target's device merely by getting them to click on a link, BBC has reported.  The discovery was made after a human rights lawyer alerted security researchers to unsolicited text messages he had received. They discovered three previously unknown flaws within Apple's code. Apple has since released a software update that addessses the problem.  The two security firms involved, Citizen Lab and Lookout, said they had held back details of the discovery until the fix had been issued. The lawyer, Ahmed Mansoor, received the text messages on 10 and 11 August. The texts promised to reveal "secrets" about people allegedly being tortured in the United Arab Emirates's jails if he tapped the links. Had he done so, Citizen Lab says, his iPhone 6 would have been "jailbroken", meaning unauthorised software could have been installed. "Once infected, Mansoor's phone would have become a digital spy in his pocket, capable of employing his iPhone's camera and microphone to snoop on activity in the vicinity of the device, recording his WhatsApp and Viber calls, logging messages sent in mobile chat apps, and tracking his movements," said Citizen Lab. "We are not aware of any previous instance of an iPhone remote jailbreak used in the wild as part of a targeted attack campaign, making this a rare find." The researchers say they believe the spyware involved was created by NSO Group, an Israeli "cyber-war" company. "It is the most sophisticated spyware package we've seen," said Lookout. "It takes advantage of how integrated mobile devices are in our lives and the combination of features only available on mobile - always connected (wi-fi, 3G/4G), voice communications, camera, email, messaging, GPS, passwords, and contact lists." NSO has issued a statement acknowledging that it makes technology used to "combat terror and crime" but said it had no knowledge of any particular incidents and made no reference to the specific spyware involved. "These are rather rare zero-day flaws," commented security expert Prof Alan Woodward, referring to the technical name for previously unknown vulnerabilities. "To have several found at once is even rarer. As can be seen from how these have been exploited to date, it represents a serious threat to the security and privacy of iOS users. "Apple has been remarkably responsive in providing fixes for these issues, so I would encourage any iOS users to update to the latest version of the operating system." For its part, Apple has limited itself to saying: "We were made aware of this vulnerability and immediately fixed it with iOS 9.3.5. We advise all of our customers to always download the latest version of iOS to protect themselves against potential security exploits."   <a href='http://ads.independent.com.mt/www/delivery/ck.php?n=a4a2316f&amp;cb=120' target='_blank'><img data-src='http://ads.independent.com.mt/www/delivery/avw.php?zoneid=35&amp;cb=120&amp;n=a4a2316f' border='0' alt='' /></a> <a href='http://ads.independent.com.mt/www/delivery/ck.php?n=a04fc846&amp;cb=168' target='_blank'><img data-src='http://ads.independent.com.mt/www/delivery/avw.php?zoneid=140&amp;cb=168&amp;n=a04fc846' border='0' alt='' /></a> <a href='http://ads.independent.com.mt/www/delivery/ck.php?n=a77228e5&amp;cb=33' target='_blank'><img data-src='http://ads.independent.com.mt/www/delivery/avw.php?zoneid=34&amp;cb=33&amp;n=a77228e5' border='0' alt='' /></a> World News At least 60 inmates killed in prison… Pope to bishops: Maintain 'zero… Watch - How not to park: Driver takes… Van, truck collide, catch fire on Thai… Dog attacks family trying to dress it… Oh, snap!

Edition: Global   One News Page “Probably the fastest-access news portal in the world” HOME WORLD SPORTS POLITICS BUSINESS PEOPLE SCITECH Science Technology  • Computer Industry •  Internet Automotive One News Page > Computer Industry > Growing Number of iPhone 6 and 6 Plus Devices Affected by Insidious 'Touch Disease' Growing Number of iPhone 6 and 6 Plus Devices Affected by Insidious 'Touch Disease' Tuesday, 23 August 2016 As the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus approach their second birthday, a growing number of users are suffering from what appears to be a latent manufacturing issue that presents as a gray flickering bar at the top of the screen and a display that's unresponsive or less responsive to touch. In a new blog post and video, repair site iFixit says a number of third-party repair outlets have seen iPhone 6 and 6 Plus models affected by the bug, which appears to be very common. STS Telecom owner Jason Villmer says he sees faulty iPhone 6 and 6 Plus models multiple times a week, while another repair tech in Louisiana sees up to 100 iPhone 6 and 6 Plus devices that don't respond well to touch. "This issue is widespread enough that I feel like almost every iPhone 6/6+ has a touch of it (no pun intended) and are like ticking bombs just waiting to act up," says Jason Villmer, owner of STS Telecom--a board repair shop in Missouri. [...] iFixit is calling the problem "Touch Disease," and says Apple appears to be aware of the issue based on dozens of complaints on Apple's support forum, but isn't "doing anything about it." Multiple people who brought their iPhones to Apple Stores were told that Apple doesn't recognize it as an issue and nothing could be done as their iPhones were out of warranty. Putting pressure on the display of an affected iPhone or twisting the device appears to reverse the issue for a short period, but the gray bar returns and touch functionality grows worse and worse until the touchscreen stops functioning all together. Replacing the display doesn't work as the problem is said to be caused by the touchscreen controller chips soldered to the logic board of the phone, and it's possible the damage is caused by the same structural design flaw that caused the major "Bendgate" controversy. In both the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, the Touch IC chips connect to the logic board via an array of itty-bitty solder balls--"like a plate resting on marbles," Jessa explains. Over time, as the phone flexes or twists slightly during normal use, those solder balls crack and start to lose contact with the board. "At first, there may be no defect at all. Later you might notice that the screen is sometimes unresponsive, but it is quick to come back with a hard reset," Jessa explains. "As the crack deepens into a full separation of the chip-board bond, the periods of no touch function become more frequent." According to iFixit, the only way to fix the problem is to replace the iPhone, replace the logic board, or replace the Touch ICs on the logic board, something Apple's in-house repair staff is not able to do. iFixit recommends users who are experiencing early symptoms of Touch Disease - an intermittently non-functional touch screen or hints of a gray bar - get their iPhones replaced outright if they're still under warranty. For those without a warranty, iFixit suggests taking an affected iPhone 6 or 6 Plus to an electronics repair shop able to replace the chips. Apple doesn't approve of third-party repairs, but it may be the only solution until the problem is officially acknowledged by the company.Related Roundup: iPhone 6s Buyer's Guide: iPhone (Caution) Discuss this article in our forums » View on web 0 shares Share on FacebookShare on TwitterPost on  RedditShare by Email   Source: Wochit Tech - on August 25, 2016< > Embed Does your iPhone 6 or 6 Plus have “touch disease”? 00:54 Dropping your smartphone on a sidewalk is one way to kill its touchscreen.

Photographer: Aidan Crawley/Bloomberg Aug 26, 2016 8:00 AM EDT The U.S. Treasury thinks it's bad enough that companies such as Apple park piles of cash overseas to avoid paying tax. What's worse is when foreign authorities change the rules that attracted the money in the first place, and tax those holdings for themselves. In effect, the European Commission is threatening to do just that. Apple and other U.S. companies could soon be hit with retrospective demands for tax running into the billions of dollars. This week the Barack Obama administration objected, accusing the commission of, among other things, exceeding its authority and violating the norms of international tax policy. Neither side is entirely in the wrong. Mainly, though, the squabble underlines a larger point that should have been obvious already. Taxing multinationals fairly and efficiently requires both an entirely new approach in the U.S. and much closer cooperation among governments. QuickTake Moving Profits to Cut U.S. Taxes The Apple case began as an internal European Union dispute. The commission is investigating whether Ireland's tax treatment of the company's earnings amounts to illegal state aid. It suspects Apple of using so-called transfer pricing to shift profits to Ireland, and Ireland of helping the company do this by means of tendentious tax opinions. Ireland's main corporate tax rate is already low, at 12.5 percent -- the U.S.'s is 35 percent, give or take -- and these maneuvers are said to have cut the rate paid by Apple to almost nothing. If the commission rules that this amounts to an illegal subsidy, Apple may have to pay billions in back taxes. The commission is right to make sure member states' tax policies conform to Europe's single-market rules. Far more debatable is the remedy the commission proposes when it finds the rules have been broken. In a case of illegal state aid, the principal offender is the government, not the company that benefited. If Apple and the other companies followed the EU's national tax rules in good faith, a hefty retroactive tax bill would be unjust. It would also defeat the purposes of certainty and clarity in tax administration. The U.S. Treasury objects to the retrospective remedy on those very grounds -- but its real grievance is that the profits at risk of incurring back taxes would in due course probably have been repatriated to the U.S., allowing the U.S. to tax them excessively. With the U.S. tax code in its current state, the administration is hardly in a position to lecture other governments on the subject of clarity and certainty in tax policy. The charge that the commission is violating international tax norms is especially rich, considering that the U.S. is almost unique in taxing its companies on their worldwide income and its citizens regardless of where in the world they live and work. By far the best remedy for the U.S. complaint would be to fix the U.S. tax system. For corporate taxes, that means two things: Apply a lower, internationally competitive rate to a simpler and broader base. And switch to a so-called territorial system -- as is used almost everywhere else -- which taxes profits according to where they're earned, not where the company resides. These reforms wouldn't eliminate international tax avoidance, but they would reduce it, both directly and by making it easier for governments to cooperate effectively to that end. The alternative is to feud and strike postures -- a lot easier than comprehensive tax reform, admittedly, but much less productive.

We have two fresh leaks for you: a famous Taiwanese pop star, Jimmy Lin, was photographed with what looks like the iPhone 7 Plus and popular tipster Evan Blass has categorically confirmed that the retail release date of the next iPhones will be on September 16. Blass stated that he is very confident about this date. Please note that Apple hasn’t sent out press invites yet for the event and therefore we still cannot confirm what the actual launch date (or release date) will be. FWIW, I'm very confident in this date. https://t.co/iaA7rZHpCa — Evan Blass (@evleaks) August 23, 2016 If you are from Taiwan, you know Jimmy Lin. He is a popular ex-pop star and now works as an actor. But, the one thing he is known more for is the fact that he has been photographed with Apple iPhones in the past even before they were launched. In 2012, Lin was photographed with the Apple iPhone 5, which he then shared, via a popular Chinese social media equivalent of Twitter called Weibo. He had also leaked the iPhone 5c in 2013. Fast forward to 2014 and once again Lin was captured showcasing the iPhone 6 alongside the iPhone 5s. In fact, he was also seen with the iPhone 6 in the same year on a desk while he was repairing the shattered screen of his iPhone 5s. Interestingly, all the phones that he has leaked in the past look like the actual devices that Apple eventually launched, and therefore Lin’s leaks hold some sort of credibility. Taiwanese celebrity Jimmy Lin spotted w/ an #iPhone7Plus but is #iPhone7 going to be boring? https://t.co/vBxHxNu5nY pic.twitter.com/c00WGLsIKC — Michael Sherlock (@therevivedone) August 23, 2016 Now, the iPhone 7 Plus that he is allegedly holding in the newest photograph has the dual-camera setup, which actually corroborates all the leaks surrounding the new camera setup. Unfortunately, the angle of the photo is such that it doesn’t show if the phone includes the headphone jack or not — it is widely rumored that Apple is planning to remove the headphone jack in favor of the lightning port for audio. Well, we will have to wait until the launch date to find out if Lin was actually holding the iPhone 7 Plus and if Evan Blass’ September 16 release date is legitimate. Taiwanese actor Jimmy Lin snapped posing with the unannounced Apple iPhone 7 Plus with dual camera setup https://t.co/vY1wQgDiBG — BGR India (@BGRIndia) August 22, 2016 In other iPhone news. Recently, Steve Wozniak, Apple’s co-founder, stated that he was concerned about the iPhone 7 without a headphone jack. Talking to the Australian Financial Review he said the following. “If it’s missing the 3.5mm earphone jack, that’s going to tick off a lot of people. I would not use Bluetooth. I don’t like wireless. If there’s a Bluetooth 2 that has higher bandwidth and better quality, that sounds like real music, I would use it. I have cars where you can plug in the music, or go through Bluetooth, and Bluetooth just sounds so flat for the same music. I have earphones with custom ear implants, they fit in so comfortably, I can sleep on them and everything. And they only come out with one kind of jack, so I’ll have to go through an adaptor. If there’s a Bluetooth 2 that has higher bandwidth and better quality, that sounds like real music, I would use it. But we’ll see. Apple is good at moving towards the future, and I like to follow that.” [Photo by Jesse Grant/Getty Images for NAMM]Another news story that actually caused a bit of concern among the Apple fans is the fact that iFixit recently found out that there is a potential touchscreen problem that is plaguing iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus users. “The iPhone screen stops responding to touch over time because of flexing circuitry and failing solder. The phones have two chips connected to a logic board that controls the display. Experts believe that the solder holding these chips becomes brittle and breaks under the constant pressure of screen pressing.” [Photo by Carl Court/Getty Images] Now Watch This: Rare Underwater Footage Captured Below Antarctic Ice Now Read This: Samsung Galaxy S8 Leak Teases Continuum Feature For Next Flagship: Android/Chrome OS Hybrid On The Way?

The other was founded by Steve Jobs. Sam Mattera (TMFMattera) Aug 26, 2016 at 6:03PM Image source: Fitbit. With a market cap approaching $580 billion, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is more than 190-times larger than Fitbit (NYSE:FIT). Apple pays a healthy dividend, derives the overwhelming majority of its revenue from smartphones, and trades at a modest 12.5-times trailing 12-month earnings. Fitbit pays no dividend, sells no smartphones, and trades with a valuation more than twice as rich. Nevertheless, the companies are competitors, and in many ways have similar business models -- both firms attain the majority of their revenue from consumer electronics. Investors looking to add exposure to the space might be drawn to consider one of these two stocks. Apple is a technology stalwart -- and, increasingly, a value stock Apple's days of rapid growth appear to be over. The company's sales contracted 15% on an annual basis last quarter, with iPhone shipments posting an identical drop. iPad sales rose modestly, but Apple's tablet business has been in decline for most of the last two years. The Mac business remains steady, although it too declined last quarter. If analyst projections prove accurate, Apple will generate about 8% less revenue in its fiscal year 2016 than it did in the year prior. Nevertheless, Apple has proven to be a solid, albeit unremarkable stock, in 2016. It's outperformed the broader market, but not to a significant degree, rising just over 6% year-to-date. The gain may have been driven by Apple's increasing preeminence as one of the best value stocks in tech. Despite the recent decline in iPhone shipments, Apple's smartphone business remains resilient in the face of intense competition. Its services business is improving (sales rose 19% on an annual basis last quarter), and it's returning more capital to shareholders. Apple currently yields just over 2%, and management has promised to increased its dividend each year for the foreseeable future. In contrast, Fitbit's business is growing rapidly What Apple's current management team hasn't done is release a revolutionary new product -- at least not anything on par with the iPhone or iPad. For a time, it appeared that the Apple Watch could be Apple's next breakout hit, but demand for the Cupertino tech giant's first wearable has proven to be relatively lackluster. Shipments of the Apple Watch fell 55% on an annual basis last quarter according to research firm IDC. Fitbit's wearable business, in contrast, is dominating. Fitbit remains the world's largest seller of wearables, capturing almost one-third of the market in the first quarter, according to IDC. To be fair, most of Fitbit's trackers are considerably cheaper than the Apple Watch, but that may be part of their appeal. Fitbit's revenue has been growing rapidly in recent quarters. Sales rose more than 100% annually in 2015, and are on pace to grow about 35% this year. To date, Fitbit has sold fewer than 50 million trackers, giving it ample opportunity for further growth, particularly overseas, as most of its sales have been to consumers in North America. As a stock, Fitbit has performed poorly since it made its public market debut last year -- shares are down about 50%. Investors seem skeptical of the company's long-term success, believing that ever-more-powerful smartwatches, including the second- and third-generation Apple Watch, could erode the market for Fitbit's comparatively less complex trackers. But if that doesn't happen, Fitbit could reward shareholders. Fitbit stock isn't cheap, but it trades at a sizable discount relative to its growth potential. At around $14.80, Fitbit is currently trading with a forward price-to-earnings ratio around 10 -- less than Apple's. Fitbit is a pure wearables play with a greater degree of risk For investors looking to add wearable exposure to their portfolios, Fitbit is the better stock. Just about all of its revenue comes from its wearable fitness trackers, and it continues to lead that market. Apple, in contrast, has emerged as a key player over the last years, but the Apple Watch remains a modest driver of Apple's financials, and that may not change anytime in the near future. Fitbit, however, appears to carry a far greater degree of risk. In the worst case scenario, demand for Fitbit's trackers could fall to almost nothing in the coming years as consumers adopt more fully featured products from companies like Apple. It's far less likely that the iPhone will suffer such a fate. Sam Mattera has no position in any stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Apple and Fitbit.

However, since the new software is already the seventh beta, it is not expected to come with new features or anything big for that matter. According to Cult of Mac, Apple rolled out two new beta software this Friday — the eighth beta of iOS 10 and the seventh beta of tvOS 10. The site noted that though both betas do not have release notes yet, it is unlikely for both to “add anything big” to the previously revealed features of the full updates that have been leaked by the previous betas. Apple’s upcoming OS for its Apple TV is said to come with major upgrades, like the introduction of Dark Mode and the inclusion of Single Sign-on, HomeKit, an enhanced Siri and a new UI for the Music Apple Music, among others. The new Dark Mode settings option is said to offer an enhanced visual experience in darker rooms, while Single Sign-on enables users to sign in once to authenticate cable credentials of all cable-supported apps, as per MacRumors.

In addition, Siri will get more language support and its topic-based search capabilities have been expanded. As for the new implementations within the Music app, 9To5Mac has learned that the Apple Music is getting a new user interface and a Library view that is inspired by the iPod Classic’s UI. To install the new tvOS 10 beta, first-time users are advised to look for the software on Apple’s Developer Center. On the other hand, developers and testers who are already enrolled in the beta testing program can get the update by just clicking on their devices’ Software Update section. It is also worth noting that the installation of the seventh tvOS 10 beta requires the connection of the Apple TV to a computer using a USB-C to USB-A cable. The upcoming tvOS 10 was announced in June at the 2016 Worldwide Developers Conference, and it is slated to be released sometime this fall.

According to global data security firm Blancco Technology Group, iOS devices had a 58 per cent failure rate while Android smartphones reported an overall failure rate of 35 per cent in the second quarter of 2016. SEE ALSO: WhatsApp to share user's phone numbers with Facebook It is the first first time that Apple's devices have a lower performance rate compared to Android, softpedia.com reported, citing the study. iPhone 6 had the highest failure rate of 29 per cent, followed by iPhone 6s and iPhone 6S Plus. For this, the study revealed the device failure rates by operating systems, manufacturers, models and regions. In the first quarter of 2016, Android smartphones had an overall failure rate of 44 per cent. "Samsung, Lenovo and LeTV were among the manufacturers with the weakest performance and higher failure rates. Samsung scored 26 per cent in failure rate, while Motorola just 11 per cent," the findings showed. iOS devices failed more frequently in North America and Asia compared to Android and the quality of the devices being shipped may be one of the reasons. The main problem iOS users faced was not being able to connect to a WiFi network, dropped connections, slow speeds and incorrect password prompts. Android smartphone users struggled with camera issues, battery charging, touchscreen issues and app crashes. SEE ALSO: Five Leaks Which Confirm That Nokia Smartphones Are Really Launching in 2016!

The vulnerabilities, collectively dubbed Trident, were combined into a malware named Pegasus by the NSO Group, an organization that reportedly specializes in “cyber war,” according to an August 25 Lookout blog post. Pegasus is highly advanced in its use of zero-days, obfuscation, encryption and kernel-level exploitation and the malware has been active for some time, the post said.  Researchers believe the spyware has already been used in the wild for state-sponsored activities, including against a Mexican journalist who reported on corruption by Mexico's head of state, and an unknown number of targets in Kenya. The malware is spread, the post said, through a basic phishing attack sequence which includes a text message, open web browser, load page, exploit vulnerabilities, install persistent software to gather information The issue was disclosed to Apple 10 days before the update was rolled out and judging by the speed by which Apple responded, the vulnerabilities were treated as critical within Apple, Guillaume Ross, a senior security consultant at Rapid 7, told SCMagazine.com via emailed comments. “This attack basically exploits an issue in Safari, exploits the kernel to effectively jailbreak the phone, and then persists on to the device,” Ross wrote. “Jailbreak software is regularly released publicly, and exploits such vulnerabilities, but with a major difference: this software exploits the iOS device locally, over USB or such an interface, and not simply by clicking a link, though that has also occurred in the past.” Ross said detecting attacks such as this is extremely difficult after the fact. "We were made aware of this vulnerability and immediately fixed it with iOS 9.3.5.,” an Apple representative told SCMagazine.com on Thursday via emailed comments. “We advise all of our customers to always download the latest version of iOS to protect themselves against potential security exploits" Zero-days attacks like Trident are extremely valuable in a world where IT is used as a weapon, and the vulnerabilities are especially valuable to nation-states looking to obtain data, Cesare Garlati, chief security strategist at the prpl Foundation, told SCMagazine.com on Thursday via emailed comments. “The one thing that surprises me is the ease with which we attribute vulnerabilities to mistakes/errors in coding,” Garlati said. “I'm more and more convinced that some of these vulnerabilities are introduced on purpose, without the knowledge of the vendor, to serve nation-states.”  California Congressman Ted Lieu (D-Ca.) said in an Aug 25. press release that he is alarmed but not surprised by the discovery of the vulnerability. “I am pleased that Apple was able to quickly address this security breach, but it is clear that Congress must do more to address the issues of mobile security,” Lieu said. “I believe a congressional hearing is in order and plan to work with my colleagues to examine these critical security concerns.” Topics: Cyberattack Vulnerabilities Vulnerabilities You must be a registered member of SC Magazine US to post a comment.

 5 years of Tim Cook's Apple, in charts Jan Dawson, Medium Aug. 25, 2016, 12:43 PM 1,460 facebook linkedin twitter email print Getty This week marks the fifth anniversary of Tim Cook’s appointment as permanent CEO at Apple  —  he was appointed CEO on August 24th, 2011. As a result, we’ll no doubt see quite a few retrospectives this week looking back over his time at Apple, and evaluating his tenure. As context for that analysis, I wanted to share some numbers about Apple in the quarter and year before he took over, and compare it with numbers for the quarter and year ending in June of this year. Not all the applicable data sets go back that far  —  Apple has changed its reporting segments in at least a couple of ways during this five year period, but we’ll mostly try to compare before and after as closely as possible. Note: here as in all the analysis on this blog, I use calendar quarters rather than companies’ fiscal quarters for analysis for ease of comprehension by those not familiar with companies’ fiscal calendars — hence, Q2 2016 is the June quarter recently ended and reported. Many of the charts shown here are part of the Apple quarterly deck which is available as part of the Jackdaw Research Quarterly Decks Service , which you can read more about here. The underlying data is also available on a custom basis as either a one-off delivery or a quarterly service — please contact me for more information. P&L measures Let’s start with the corporate income statement. By any measure, Apple is simply a lot larger than it was five years ago. Here are trailing 4-quarter revenues: Apple Reporting, Jackdaw Research Revenues in the four quarters before Tim Cook was appointed were $100 billion, whereas in the last four quarters they were over $200 billion. However, as you can see from the chart, it hasn’t been an inexorable rise up and to the right. Revenues grew very strongly in that first period, then began to level off somewhat throughout 2012 and 2013, then spiked following the iPhone 6 launch. And of course over the past year revenue growth has been negative for the first time in many years at Apple. The overall effect is still a more than doubling of total revenue, but the current trajectory is negative. As I’ve written previously, I continue to believe that we’ll see a reversal of this trend in the next few quarters as a combination of factors kicks in, but I’m betting Tim Cook would have rather his 5 year anniversary would have fallen either side of this lull instead of in the middle of it. Meanwhile, margins have been up and down over time, with a bump in the early part of Tim Cook’s time at the helm, followed by a drop down to slightly lower levels, a steady rise, and then a drop off again: Apple reporting, Jackdaw research The ups and downs here largely correlate to overall growth rates for Apple, with higher revenue growth rates driving higher margins for a time as cost expansion takes a while to catch up with revenue growth, only to fall again as growth slows. On operating and net margin, Apple has ended these five years slightly below where it started, whereas on gross margin it’s in more or less the same place. But it’s worth noting that dollar profits are still way up on where they were, and that’s the metric that Apple and its investors are likely more focused on: Apple Reporting, Jackdaw Research Yes, there’s the same up-and-down pattern, but again operating income on a twelve-month basis is roughly twice what it was five years ago over the past year. R&D spend has ballooned The only other line from the income statement I want to zero in on is research and development spending, because there’s been a fairly dramatic change here over the past five years. Here’s total R&D spend in dollars on a twelve-month basis, and spending as a percentage of revenue: Apple Reporting, Jackdaw Research Apple Reporting, Jackdaw Research R&D spend was under $2.5 billion the four quarters before Tim Cook took over, but it was almost $10 billion five years later, a roughly fourfold increase. And that’s not just because Apple’s revenue has grown during that time — R&D has actually grown significantly as a percentage of revenue over the same period, going from just over 2% to just over 4%, or almost doubling as a percentage. That’s interesting, because R&D actually fell fairly consistently as a percentage of revenue during most of Steve Jobs’ second stint as Apple CEO, from a peak of 8% in 2001 and 2002 all the way down to 2% just before Cook took over. That’s largely a function of the massive iPod- and iPhone-driven revenue growth during that period — dollar R&D spend rose from around $400 million a year to over $2 billion a year during the same time period — but it’s interesting to note that Cook has reversed the trend and significantly increased R&D spend even above and beyond the rate at which revenue has grown. Interestingly, that 2 percentage point increase in R&D spend is roughly equal to the 2 percentage point drop in margins during the Tim Cook era. The cash hoard grows The other major corporate financial metric that’s worth a quick look is cash. Apple’s cash and investment assets have grown enormously over the past five years, as the two charts below show: Apple reporting, Jackdaw Research Apple reporting, Jackdaw Research The starting and ending totals are easier to see in the second chart, but the steady growth is perhaps easier to see in the first. Regardless, Apple ended calendar Q2 2011 with a total balance of cash and investments of $76 billion, while it ended Q2 2016 with a balance of $231.5 billion. In other words, it has added over $155 billion to its coffers over this time. Meanwhile, an increasing proportion of this cash and investments has been held overseas — the percentage was 63% five years ago, but was 93% at the end of Q2 2016. Of course, the other cash-related metric worth noting during the first five years of the Cook era is the way Apple has been using that cash to pay dividends and buy back stock. Steve Jobs famously refused to pay dividends, but around a year into his tenure, Tim Cook instituted both these programs to return cash to shareholders. As of April of this year, Apple said it had “returned over $163 billion to shareholders, including $117 billion in share repurchases.” That makes the increase in its overall pile of cash and investments all the more remarkable. Unit shipments are up for iPhone, less so for other products One of the most interesting things to look at in regard to the last five years is what’s happened to unit shipments for Apple’s three major product lines. The long-term trend is shown in this first chart: Apple Reporting, Jacksaw Research Again, we’re all familiar with the trajectory of iPhone sales over recent years, so let’s be brief here. It’s worth noting that Tim Cook’s appointment coincided with the decision to move the launch date for new iPhones from June to the Fall, with the iPhone 4s launching in October of 2011. That explains the flat part at the beginning of the iPhone chart above. Following that shift, though, the iPhone saw strong growth in 2012 and 2013, but began to flatten out, only to spike in late 2014 and into 2015 thanks to the iPhone 6, then slumping a little in late 2015 and the first half of 2016. But again, it’s worth looking at the total numbers here. Apple shipped 69 million iPhones in the four quarters to Q2 2011, and shipped 214 million in the most recent four quarters. That’s a massive expansion of Apple’s business here, despite the recent lull (shipments peaked at 231.5 million on a twelve month basis in Q4 2015). It’s also interesting to note that Apple has shipped 859 million iPhones during the Tim Cook era, compared with just 130 million in the pre-Cook era. In other words, roughly 87% of the almost one billion iPhones Apple has ever sold have been sold during Tim Cook’s time as permanent CEO. What’s almost more interesting, though, is what’s happened to Mac and iPad sales, which performed roughly the same in the most recent quarter as they did five years ago: Apple Reporting/Jackdaw Research As you can see, both Mac and iPad sales were up just a few hundred thousand on those from five years earlier, despite the doubling of iPhone sales over the same period. As the earlier chart shows, for iPads that’s because sales first grew significantly, peaking at 26 million quarterly and 74 million over twelve months in Q4 2013 and falling since. Mac sales, too, have had better quarters than the most recent one, though the peak was not much higher than today. Both products are due for something of a rebound in the coming quarters, as new Mac are (hopefully) finally introduced and the iPad Pro trend continues to help sales. And it’s worth noting that 300 of the roughly 330 million total iPads sold to date have been sold under Tim Cook, along with almost 112 million Macs. Of course, we don’t have official shipment numbers for the Apple Watch, though there are various estimates out there. But it would be inappropriate to skip over that product entirely — it was the first brand-new product introduced in the Tim Cook era, and likely sold around 15 million units in its first year on the market. That’s a much faster run-rate than the iPhone, but down a little at this point on iPad sales in their first year. But it’s interesting that, as Tim Cook marks his five year anniversary, we’re seeing another product whose launch timeframe is being moved from the first half to the second half of the year, causing something of a lull in sales in the meantime. A changing mix of segment revenues All that movement in unit shipments obviously flows through to product revenues too. The revenue split by segment has changed fairly significantly over Tim Cook’s tenure. Apple’s financial reporting by segment has also changed over the last five years, with the iPod no longer separated out as its own reporting line, the Accessories bucket being merged with iPod, Apple Watch, Apple into “Other Products” and “iTunes, Software, and Services” becoming just “Services”. In the chart below, I’ve collapsed these segments for comparability: Apple Reporting, Jackdaw Research The iPhone, which was already a very significant portion of Apple’s overall revenue, has only become more dominant over the past five years, rising from 45% of revenue in the twelve months to Q2 2011 to 64% in the year to Q2 2016. But other components have also risen or fallen  —  iPad has dropped from 16% to 9% and Mac from 20% to 11%, while the combination of iPod, accessories, and various other hardware products has dropped quite a bit too. The only other segment that’s risen as a portion of the total during this time  —  despite the rapid growth of iPhone revenues  —  is Services. An increase from 9% to 10% of revenue doesn’t look like much, but it’s much more impressive when you look at the dollar amounts instead: Apple Reporting, Jackdaw Research What’s now the Services segment has grown from under $10 billion in the twelve months to Q2 2011 to well over $20 billion in the most recent twelve months, with the trajectory actually steepening in recent quarters. Yes, it’s still just 10% of total revenue over the past year, but it’s actually Apple’s fastest-growing segment at the moment. The other interesting thing to look at in the context of segment revenue is the difference between unit shipments and revenue performance, which is driven by changing average selling prices (ASPs). You can see it a little in iPhone revenues: Apple Reporting/Jackdaw Research By now, that iPhone trajectory should be familiar, but it’s worth noting the growth — from just over $40 billion on a twelve-month basis to $140 billion. It’s subtle, but the 3.1x growth in shipments has translated into a 3.5x growth in revenue, and that’s largely down to ASPs. Here are average selling prices on a trailing 4-quarter basis for the three major product lines at the beginning and end of Tim Cook’s first five years — note that because of changes in reporting structures I’ve used Q3 rather than Q2 2011 as the starting point here: Apple Reporting/Jackdaw Research As you can see, iPhone ASPs have risen over the five years despite the increasing maturity of the product and the introduction of two cheaper models (the iPhone 5c and more recently the iPhone SE). Mac ASPs have dropped, but only slightly, while iPad ASPs have dropped fairly significantly, driven by the launch of the iPad Mini in 2012 and the increasing tendency to keep older devices in the lineup for longer at lower prices. But something interesting has been happening to iPad revenues in recent quarters, even as shipments continue to fall year on year: Apple Reporting/Jackdaw Research This flattening of revenues, and the growth this past quarter, has been driven by the iPad Pro, which has raised ASPs considerably. iPad ASPs bottomed out at around $415 a year ago, but were $490 in Q2 2016, up $60 from Q1, putting them back at late 2012 levels. Regional trends and the rise of China One of the most dramatic changes at Apple in the Tim Cook era has been the rise of China as one of its two major markets. Here, again, unfortunately, we’re thwarted a little by a change in Apple’s reporting a few years back, in which it eliminated Retail as a separate segment and rolled it into the individual regions, so we’re going to use Q4 rather than Q2 2011 as our starting point, and for comparability we’ll use Q4 2015 as the end point. As such, we’re measuring a four-year rather than five-year period, but the changes are still very visible. Here’s the share of Apple’s revenue by region at those two points in time: Apple Reporting/Jackdaw Research As you can see, Greater China has increased massively as a proportion of revenue over this period, going from 10% to 24% of revenues, while every other region has shrunk in percentage terms. In Q4 2015, Greater China contributed the same percentage of revenue as Europe. Looking at the dollar amounts is again helpful — here’s actual revenue by region for those two quarters: Apple Reporting/Jackdaw Research It’s worth noting first that every region has grown during these four years, but Greater China has clearly grown far faster than any other region, from $4.5 billion to over $18 billion during this time. That’s massive growth, and I’d say it’s one of Tim Cook’s great achievements during his tenure. It’s also clearly something he hasn’t given up on, given his recent frequent visits to China and the investments in Didi and in an R&D center to be built there. It’s also worth looking at operating income by geography, because here too China has made a significant contribution: Apple Reporting/Jackdaw Research Retail is far more international I want to close out with Apple’s retail business, which gets less attention in Apple’s official reporting than it used to, since Retail has been wrapped into the regions, but is as important to Apple’s strategy as ever. And Tim Cook has been instrumental in expanding the Retail footprint, especially overseas, though Retail has also been the focal point of arguably Cook’s biggest blunder as CEO — the appointment of John Browett to run the business. However, Angela Ahrendts’ appointment seems to have more than made up for that mistake. Here are a couple of charts about Apple’s retail footprint: Apple Reporting, Jackdaw Research Apple Reporting, Jackdaw Research At the end of Q2 2011, Apple had a total of 327 retail stores, of which 236 or 72% were in the US. By the end of Q2 2016, Apple had 488 stores globally, of which 218 or 45% were now overseas. Tim Cook’s time as CEO has seen Apple stores opened in seven new countries across four continents: Apple Reporting/Jackdaw Research But of course it’s also seen a massive expansion in the number of Apple stores in China, which had 36 stores as of the end of July, up from single digits when Tim Cook took over. Conclusions I’ve deliberately made this more of a factual post than an evaluation of Tim Cook’s tenure — as I said up front, this week will see lots of this sort of stuff, and I’ve already talked to several reporters doing their best to sum up five years of work in a few hundred words. But I think it’s worth noting several things here, some of which I’ve mentioned in the text: Apple under Tim Cook has sold far more iPhones and iPads than it ever did under Steve Jobs — 87% of total iPhones sold and 90% of iPads ever sold. Though Steve Jobs launched these products, it was always Tim Cook who ensured the supply chain met demand as well as possible, and it’s been Tim Cook who’s overseen the massive expansion in that supply chain over the last five years as the scale has grown to something unprecedented. Tim Cook has made the decision to increase Apple’s spending on research and development not just in dollar terms commensurate with revenue growth but actually doubling it as a percentage of revenue during his tenure despite the massive growth in revenue. That reversed the trend under Steve Jobs, and the increased investment in R&D is roughly equivalent to the drop in margins during this time — Cook has made a massive bet on R&D and by implication on future products. Cook has made China a special focus, and this focus has paid off in a big way, with a roughly fourfold increase in revenue from Greater China and an equivalent increase in operating income. Greater China has grown from 10% of revenues to roughly a quarter, and Apple’s retail footprint there has also grown dramatically. That growth in China has been a major contributor to Apple’s overall growth in the last five years, and Cook clearly remains committed to China as a focus for Apple as evidenced by his recent investments there. He’s begun to talk more about India and its potential, but I remain skeptical that India can be much more than a rounding error for Apple over the next few years. Only one entirely new hardware product has launched under Tim Cook, and yet we have almost no official data to go on to evaluate the performance of the Apple Watch so far. Opinion remains divided about how to evaluate the Watch, but I’m on the side of those who considers it a modest success in Apple terms and a smash hit in the context of the market into which it was launched. Like the iPhone the year Tim Cook took over, it’s going through an interesting transition as its release moves from the first half to the second half of the year, but I suspect that like the iPhone in late 2011, the Watch is due for big growth in late 2016 and beyond. I suspect the transformation we’ve seen in Services, driven largely to date by the App Store and latterly by Apple Music, is just the start of what we’ll see under Tim Cook. He’s already hinted several times at additional services to come, and TV is an obvious focus here. But I also think some of the rhetoric about Services has been overblown — it’s still only 10% of revenue, and unlikely to grow massively past that point unless Apple decouples services from its devices, which I think would be a mistake. Perhaps one of the most significant contributions Tim Cook has made at Apple can’t be seen in any of these charts, because it’s about the changes to Apple’s culture that have happened under his leadership. The increased openness, best exemplified by the frequent interviews Cook and other executives now regularly grant to various publications (and even podcasters), is one element of this, though Apple’s secrecy about future products remains as tight as ever. But an increased sense of social responsibility, especially as regards the environment and contributions to social causes is another major change. This doesn’t have a direct financial impact, but it’s made a positive contribution nonetheless, and no evaluation of Cook’s tenure would be complete without a recognition of that fact.

More Comments Tumblr Pinterest Reddit Digg FarkIt StumbleUpon How do you replace Steve Jobs? People had tried before and failed: When Apple’s founder left amid a boardroom coup in 1985, the string of leaders that filled the void almost brought the company to its knees until Jobs’ triumphant return over a decade later. So when Jobs’ hand-picked successor, Tim Cook, took command on August 24, 2011 — five years ago this week — it was always bound to be one of the most-scrutinised handovers in corporate history. Jobs, who would die of pancreatic cancer 13 days later, had been a model of leadership and innovation. He had been central to the polished icons of the 21st century computing: the iPod, iPhone and iPad, bringing a flair that had made them seem like more than mere products. Related Stepping out of Steve Jobs’s shadow, Tim Cook champions the promise of Apple Inc Once taunted by co-founder Steve Jobs, companies are now big customers for Apple Inc Cook, meanwhile, was the less-visible chief operating officer; the master of the supply chain who rose at 4:30am every morning to keep the well-oiled machine ticking over. And though he was the obvious candidate to replace the irreplaceable, analysts doubted whether he would be able to keep the Apple magic alive. Five years later, the same questions persist. Few would deny he was the right man for the job, but under Cook, Apple has yet to release an undisputed hit product. The world’s biggest company While the line-up of products in Apple’s stores bears a resemblance to that of five years ago, the company Cook runs has been transformed. Under his tenure, Apple has become the world’s biggest public company, and twice broken the record for the biggest quarterly profit in history. The company has also doubled in size. During Jobs’ last full quarter as chief executive, Apple sold 20.3 million iPhones: it now sells more than double that. Its 110,000 staff today compare with just over 60,000 five years ago. When Jobs passed the baton, it had four stores in China, against 41 today. This monumental expansion has also put pressure on Apple over taxes and its swelling overseas cash pile, which Cook has said he is not ready to repatriate without US reform, despite pressures from agitated investors such as Carl Icahn to return more money to shareholders. The challenge has required a steady hand. Cook has had to appear in front of US politicians at high-profile hearings and charm European politicians investigating its tax affairs, as well as appease grumbling investors. His record here has been impressive: Apple’s share price has more than doubled under Cook. Innovation Apple, though, is not known for stock buy-backs; it is known for the life-changing product, the thing that consumers don’t know they want until they see it, at which point they positively need it. And while Jobs would surround himself with visionaries such as Sir Jonathan Ive, he was still the beating heart of these best-selling inventions. When Jobs stepped down, the key question was whether Apple would be able to continue its hot streak, and five years later, the jury is still out. One of the company’s first releases under Cook’s command was the disastrous Apple Maps, which missed entire towns and important transport links. Cook’s most significant new product has been last year’s Apple Watch, which has proved more of a niche product for committed consumers than a worldwide phenomenon. Sales to date are estimated at around 15?million, above average in an emerging wearable technology market, but barely moving the dial for a company of Apple’s proportions. Cook’s ability to keep Apple moving upwards has instead been rooted in growing sales of the iPhone, which have increased particularly impressively in markets such as China and India. The iPhone, though, makes up more than half of Apple’s sales – more than it did when Jobs stepped down, leading some to question if Apple is over-reliant on one thing. Cook recently described the popularity of the iPhone as “a privilege, not a problem,” but as the smartphone market has begun to saturate, it has seemed more like the latter: after 13 years of rising revenues, sales have fallen for the last two quarters. Criticism of Cook’s innovation record is often unfair, however: while Apple has continued to refresh its top products with new features, there is never likely to be another iPhone. Instead, Cook has focused on selling more of the software and services that live on the one billion iPhones and iPads in use today. Sales from apps and services increased by 19pc year on year in the last quarter. The services business includes Apple Music and Apple Pay – two of the more successful new products Apple has launched under Cook – and is now bigger than both the iPad and Mac computers. Social issues If there is one thing that has separated Cook from his predecessor, though, it has been in trying to make Apple not only a technological force, but a very public beacon for corporate responsibility. Cook has campaigned more than many for race and gender equality and gay rights: he became the most high-profile chief executive to come out as gay two years ago, and has made efforts to improve diversity amongst Apple’s workforce. Apple also became a figurehead for privacy activists this year when Cook refused to bow to the FBI’s demands that Apple unlock an iPhone used by a shooter involved in a terrorist attack in California last year, labelling the request a “dangerous precedent”. Cook eventually won the fight. On the day he took over from Jobs, Cook told staff: “I want you to be confident that Apple is not going to change,” On that point, at least, he was very wrong.

Photo: Apple Apple CEO Tim Cook is taking advantage of the monstrous bonus he unlocked on his fifth anniversary at the helm of Apple by selling 334,000 shares for a big payday. Priced between $107.21 to $107.69 per share, the stock dump netted Cook more than $35 million. Not a bad bonus for the most powerful man in tech. A recent SEC filing revealed that in order to comply with minimum statutory tax withholding requirements for the RSUs that vested on Tim Cook’s fifth anniversary, Apple sold 656,117 shares on his behalf. The Apple CEO still owns over 1.3 million shares worth over $140 million. Apple awarded Cook 980,000 Apple shares for his performance as part of the larger compensation package he signed in 2011. With his big five-year bonus, Cook is poised to be one of the highest paid CEOs in the US for 2016. Leave a comment Deals of the Day See all deals Peter Just before iPhone 7 announcement ?

Apple loves making their products as simple as possible. The iPod was a success because of how clean it looked compared to other MP3 players. With Apple TV, Steve Jobs bragged about how few buttons the device’s remote had. But since 2007, every new iPhone has had the same number of physical buttons, switches, and ports: A ringer switch, a lock button, volume up/down buttons, a USB port, and a headphone jack. That changes next month, when Apple is expected to announce that the iPhone 7 will be lacking a headphone jack. Instead, users will be listening to music via the Lightning port (which you currently use to charge and sync your iPhone). And for 2017, Apple will reportedly go one step further by removing the Home button. Ah, the Home button. It’s always been there for us — it’s our captain for navigating the iPhone. We use it to switch between apps, we use it to get to our Home screen, we use it to summon Siri, and we use it to read our finger print. Back in the “old days,” we used it to force quit apps when they froze on us. In a new report, Bloomberg says Apple is planning to remove the Home button for the 2017 iPhone, which will presumably be called iPhone 7s. It’s billed as a “major redesign of the iPhone for 2017 that focuses more heavily on the display.” Previous rumor mill reports have suggested that Apple will ditch the Home button in order to decrease the size of the top top and bottom bezels, thereby making the phone not as tall, or using the freed up space to add more screen. Here’s a mock up of what that could look like, via TapSmart: What remains unclear is how users will be able to unlock and navigate their iPhone without the Home button. Reports have suggested that the whole screen will serve as a TouchID surface and a Home button (using the 3D Touch feature Apple launched last year). Interestingly, next month’s release of iOS 10 will introduce a new way to unlock your iPhone: You’ll have to press down on the Home button to activate an unlocking. Previously, all you had to do was rest your finger on the Home button while your lock screen was awake.

My addiction Up until this year, I was one of the biggest pop culture connoisseurs that I knew. In fact, I used to pride myself on how much pop culture I could consume. It was a large part of my identity. Whenever anyone talked about how many shows they’d watch per week, I’d always low-key brag about averaging 15-17 shows a week and would enjoy the stunned looks on their faces. Those looks alone gave me a sort of feeling of accomplishment that I just couldn’t find elsewhere. Read full article 2016 was a year of many changes for me, but none were as shocking to me as my altered relationship with pop culture and fandom. My addiction Up until this year, I was one of the biggest pop culture connoisseurs that I knew. In fact, I used to pride myself on how much pop culture I could consume. It was a large part of my identity. Whenever anyone talked about how many shows they’d watch per week, I’d always low-key brag about averaging 15-17 shows a week and would enjoy the stunned looks on their faces. Those looks alone gave me a sort of feeling of accomplishment that I just couldn’t find elsewhere. In addition to watching (and keeping up with) an insane number of TV shows, I’d also see popular movies right when they were released and read about a book a week. This is all in addition to soaking up as much TV and movie news as possible. Over the years, my friends would come to know me as a pop culture knowledge database and pretty much get their news from me. In other words, pop culture was my life. It had been since I was a child and my savvyness peaked at the end of 2015. Pop culture was my lifeline when things in my personal or work life would go sour. I had Hypable, a packed TV calendar, a Netflix account, and a constant stream of exciting movies to see. What more could I want? But two things happened at the end of 2015 that would impact my 2016 more than I could’ve predicted: I decided that I wanted to finally quit my job and go on a trip through Europe (and I’d actually follow through with it). For the first time in my life, I experienced fandom fatigue and pop culture overload. I’ve always been someone who played it safe and planned ahead, so to not really know what was going to happen in my future and where I would be by the end of 2016 was terrifying. And yet, because of my (self-diagnosed) fandom fatigue, I couldn’t really turn to my pop culture comfort food because I just didn’t really want it. Of course, time marched on and 2016 arrived. My fandom fatigue slowly cleared up and I wouldn’t have to really face the life decision I made for myself until the summer. Things were slowly going back to normal for me. (Or so I thought.) Going cold turkey on pop culture Fast forward to the beginning of July. I left my job of three years and was getting ready to go on the trip of a lifetime: A month-long tour of Western Europe. With a group of 33 strangers. While I had a few of your typical fears (ie. “Did I just make the biggest mistake of my life?” and “What if I end up hating all of the people on my trip and spend a month alone?”), I was also afraid of missing out on any important pop culture news. So I did what any sane person would do: I set up a Google doc for my closest friends to drop news story links into while I was away. Mind you, I had been planning to create this Google doc for months. It wasn’t a last-minute inspired idea. It was premeditated. After all, I was basically throwing my entire life into chaos and couldn’t bear to lose my lifeline too. From July 8 to August 6, I traveled all around Western Europe with my EF College Break group, checking my Google doc whenever I had downtime. However, because I was in Europe, scanning the Google doc became more of a habitual thing rather than a compulsion. I didn’t even really check my social feeds as much as usual (which was quite a change for me considering that I basically lived on Twitter). I was surrounded by amazing places and people and didn’t really need much else beyond that. When I noticed my declining interest in pop culture news, I just chalked it up to being on vacation. But then when I came back, an odd thing happened: I couldn’t bring myself to power up my computer or open my social media apps on my phone. It just wasn’t something I wanted to do. I wanted to be outside exploring and living in the moment. My technology couldn’t give that to me. So, my feeds went practically unread for another full week (on top of the four I had been out of the country). Sure, I pushed out personal updates and musings, but I didn’t consume anything. Again, I just chalked up my mood to my post-trip depression. I’d be better in no time. But I wasn’t. Sure, I didn’t stay away from social media for too long, but I didn’t constantly scan and refresh my feeds like I used to. Speed-reading novels became exhausting so I stopped reading altogether. My 4th and 5th conventions of the year seemed more like a chore than a treat. Motivating myself to write started to require a lot of effort and strain. And movies? Well, I saw Suicide Squad the day after I came home, but didn’t see another movie in theaters for at least a month. And then there’s the fall TV season. I started out with about 18 shows and almost immediately fell behind on half of them. For a little while, I felt like I was letting myself down. I was no longer up on all of the news in the fandom world nor was I even up to date with my shows. What was happening to me? I’m a Hypable writer! Fandom is in my blood! My pop culture hunger was abating. After going from feeling overloaded to completely depriving myself of pop culture, my system was in a sort of shock and was trying to figure out where my happy medium lies. Not only was my enthusiasm and craving for these things waning, but I was also experiencing some pretty awful side effects. I was irritable more often than not and found myself having trouble concentrating on simple things. I also agonized over how I was going to fit everything I wanted to do and everything I needed to do into a 24/7-shaped box. In other words, I was a miserable mess. Something had to give. I needed to rethink my involvement and enthusiasm for fandom. Quality over quantity Knowing that, in my heart, I didn’t want to go cold turkey once again on the entertainment that I loved, I began to cut back. On everything. I started cancelling episode and series recordings on my DVR. I no longer forced myself to catch up from where I last left off on each of my social feeds before I went to bed and after I woke up in the morning. I decided that paring down my pop culture consumption was the best thing for me. I started focusing on enjoying the things I loved most and tabling everything else. In other words, I adopted a sort of “quality over quantity” mindset. (To be clear, when I say “quality,” I’m not referring to the fandom entities themselves. I’m not commenting on their inherent value or if I think they’re good or bad. I’m simply categorizing them by their importance to me. The things I get true entertainment and value out of that I don’t want to live without.) The shows I made an effort to watch ASAP (live or via DVR) remained on my TV calendar and those I found myself skipping over were cut out. Pretty soon, I was only regularly watching about half (if that) of the 18 shows a week I had initially put into my fall TV calendar. My quality over quantity mission didn’t just go for TV, however. Instead of getting excited for every. single. movie. release that was fandom related and feeling compelled to see them all, I kept my expectations in check. Low-balled a few of them, even. There are still must-see movies for me, don’t get me wrong. But I no longer feel guilty over not being excited or motivated to see some fandom-related ones. To this day, I still haven’t seen the most recent Star Trek, X-Men, and Ghostbusters movies (to name a few), even though I’ve seen and enjoyed their predecessors. They’re just not that high on my to-watch list. Sure, there are a few downsides to my new “quality over quantity” approach to pop culture and media. Because I no longer push myself to catch up on my social media feeds (namely Twitter), I feel like I’m missing out on the lives of my internet friends. I could very well be missing out on new pop culture gems (like Speechless). I’ve given up on shows and franchises that I’ve enjoyed and invested myself in in the past. It hasn’t been an easy transition for me by any means, but the rewards have outweighed the losses. The aftermath After making the change to how I consumed and interacted with pop culture, I started seeing positive shifts in my everyday life. I found myself feeling less burdened and stressed. I’ve been able to start really enjoying the media I’m consuming without being bogged down by guilt over other things I should be watching or reading instead. I’m not saying that limiting my intake solved all of my problems, but it definitely helped. Ever since I’ve started focusing on the things I love the most instead of trying to muster high levels of enthusiasm for a wide array of things, I’ve found myself coming back around to pop culture and fandom. Watching shows is becoming enjoyable again and my motivation to write is (thankfully) returning. I don’t think I’ll ever get back to consuming as much as I was before 2016 hit, but I no longer dread engaging with pop culture and media as I once did. It’s true that 2016 was an awful year in many ways but, as I sit here writing this while watching Return of the Jedi in honor of Carrie Fisher, I’m thankful that it has forced me to reprioritize the role of pop culture and fandom in my life. If it weren’t for my 2016 reality check, I’d be sitting here stressing over watching something off of my DVR or doing some other fandom-related task rather than watching my favorite Star Wars movie for the umpteenth time in memory of one of my favorite female role models. Pop culture used to be my life and, for years, I accepted that. I embraced it to the point where it was a large part of identity. But, in 2016, that got to be too stressful and I realized that the way I was interacting with it just wasn’t sustainable for me anymore. While it’s no longer my entire life, it is still an important part of who I am. That will never change. I’m now just approaching it in a way that’s healthier for me and allows me to enjoy everything to the fullest. Thanks to 2016 and my new “quantity over quality” motto, I finally feel free to enjoy pop culture in the way that’s best for me in 2017 and beyond.

Read full article As the news broke that Carrie Fisher had died, people from all corners of the world, all walks of life, came together to mourn her death. I’ve struggled with how to deal with that overwhelming feeling of grief myself, how to channel it, how to quantify this emptiness I’ve felt since learning of Carrie Fisher’s passing. And so I thought I’d take a leaf out of her book and do what she did best. Talk about it. Carrie Fisher entered my life the way she did for so many people, as Princess Leia Organa, taking charge of an impossible situation and leading with confidence, conviction, and strength in the face of losing her whole world. It was like nothing I’d ever seen before. I was in love. I wanted to be her. And for the longest time, I was her. Walking in the steps that Leia first tread, from A New Hope to Empire Strikes Back, I learnt that it was okay to be outspoken about what I believed in, what I loved, what I wanted to stand for. I found my own voice through Leia and her steadfast belief in the rebellion against the Empire, and I refused to let anyone silence it. Society dictated I had to behave a certain way, love in a conventional manner, and temper my passion to acceptable outlets for a young woman. But that just wasn’t me. Thanks to Leia, I learned to find who I loved in my own time and my own way, I refused to allow my passions to be quashed, and I led, I fought, and I rebelled. I’m sure, for most, I came across as somewhat headstrong and stubborn, but I was also fiercely loyal and stood steadfast for myself and for everyone around me. That’s not to say that that path was always easy. But where Leia forged it, Carrie Fisher was there to take my hand when I faltered. Throughout my late teens and into my adult life I struggled — and continue to struggle — with my mental health. There’s a bone deep exhaustion, mentally and physically, that goes hand in hand with fighting and continuing to fight against cultural conditioning. Against the expectations of your family. As I grew and discovered what made me me, I railed more against those expectations. My sexuality wasn’t nearly as clear cut as I thought it might be. I was moving away from the familiarity of home and into isolation. I suffered from a painful, and chronic condition, that often left me in bed — and one that my doctors either brushed off, or didn’t have the answer for. I was exaggerating, I was dramatic, I was confused, I was any number of words at the same time, except for one: true. The stigma attached to mental health issues was so ingrained in both myself, and the people around me, that silence seemed to be the only acceptable option. And so I internalized it. Kept it locked deep in my gut and swallowed down the words whenever I thought they might spill out of me. Right up until I thought I might choke on them. Which was when Carrie found me all over again. In 2006, when I felt out of my depth and fighting a losing battle against my own mind, struggling with slowly losing a family member to an illness that turned her mind against her, I stumbled on a documentary called The Secret Life of the Manic Depressive, and there she was. The Princess that defined my childhood, redefining how I looked at my mental health. How I looked at myself. It was like a dam had burst and I started searching for her words outside of the ones I could recite by heart. I devoured Postcards from the Edge, and every interview I could dig up — be they by page, or footage I managed to find online. Then there was Shockaholic and Wishful Drinking in 2008, the former of which has now become dog-eared from reading and rereading, letting every inch of it soak into me, bone deep. The more that I read, the less alone I felt. And I broke my silence. I talked about my struggles, first with friends, then with a professional. I refused to be browbeaten by doctors regarding my pain, or shamed. I found myself again, through that fog, and held on tight. As Carrie refused to be painted as a histrionic woman with mental health issues, so too did I. That fight will never truly be over, but I know the strength of my own voice, of taking the time for self-care, and to live my life, though my mind may try and drag me down every step of the way. Carrie lived her life openly, allowing us an intimate look at her struggles as well as her triumphs. She stood firm in the face of sexism, the stigmas about mental illness, and she did so with a humour that struck a chord with so many of us. In her own words from Shockaholic, “After death takes someone from you, it gives you something back. It makes smells sharper and the sun brighter and sex more urgent. It’s as though you’re living for two now. Their memory lives inside you, and you feed it. You live for them now that they can’t anymore.” That legacy lives on in all of us. In me. Carrie’s words helped me through some of my darkest days. Her continued presence in the advent of social media kept her at my back, as though she was urging me to keep pressing forward. Those words will never die. But now it’s our time to add to them. The baton is at our feet. At mine. I’m picking it up.

You may not be aware that The OA came out since its marketing campaign began just a few days before the actual release, but this show is definitely one of the best originals the streaming giant has put out. Well, I say best but some friends have said it’s the worst. If anything The OA has been extremely polarizing since people have finished it, and for good reason. Read full article The latest Netflix original The OA premiered last Friday and now that we’ve had a full week to think it over, here’s our review. You may not be aware that The OA came out since its marketing campaign began just a few days before the actual release, but this show is definitely one of the best originals the streaming giant has put out. Well, I say best but some friends have said it’s the worst. If anything The OA has been extremely polarizing since people have finished it, and for good reason. The OA centers around Prairie, a woman who has been missing for the past seven years. Prairie was blind when she got abducted and the series begins with her finding her way back home now with the ability to see and a very complicated history to explain. She confides in five strangers to tell her story to, and that’s where our journey begins. It’s almost impossible to discuss The OA without spoiling at least some aspects of it. The show is one of those things that is best watched when you have no idea what it’s really about, so consider these first few paragraphs your spoiler-free review: Watch it. It’s great. Now that we got that out of the way it’s time to talk about why I think this show is so fantastic, so here’s your spoiler warning for those who haven’t seen it yet. When this show’s marketing campaign first started I wasn’t sure how to feel about it. Another story about a missing person? Haven’t we already had, like, tons of those? But this isn’t just some story about a missing person, this is the story about a girl who believes she is The Original Angel. The reveal of what OA stands for blew my mind, along with my roommate’s who I dragged into watching. The show may start off as this story about a girl born in Russia but then turns into a whole new beast when we meet Katoon, someone who I can only describe as Prairie’s guardian angel of some sort. That is when we get into the realm of angels and death and that is when my interest in this show multiplied by a thousand. The OA‘s entire concept revolves around near death experiences, or NDEs for short, and how some people who experience them come back with incredible talents like musical abilities or language proficiency. This is a real thing – people have actually had NDEs and are then reported to have incredible abilities they didn’t have before. I think that’s why I’m so in love with this show, because it takes a concept that is real and then explores the fantastical aspects. But it’s not the concept of the show that people have a problem with, it’s the ending. So let’s get into the nitty gritty, shall we? Prairie, who I’ll be calling OA from this point forward since that’s her preferred name, escaped her town to look for her biological father. Given that she’s blind and won’t be able to find him easily she’s convinced that her ability to play the violin (which her father taught her) will call him to her. Her musical talents definitely get noticed but not by the man she was hoping for. Cue Jason Isaacs, who all Harry Potter fans will know as Lucius Malfoy. Isaacs plays Hap, a man who believes in the incredible effects of NDEs and wants to study them. He finds OA playing in the New York subway and manages to befriend her and convince her to come stay with him at his home. Turns out that he had no intention of playing friendly host to a stranger, and in fact OA is just one of six other people who have also experienced NDEs that Hap has abducted. Hap kept these people in what’s essentially a large glass cage with six different compartments. It’s unsettling to watch OA sit on the bed in that cage, thankful for having a place to sleep only to realize moments later that the door was locked and she’s trapped in a tiny room, a place she’ll be for the next seven years. Over those next seven years OA begins to understand what’s happening. Hap believes that when people have near death experiences they cross over into the after life which is exactly what he’s trying to study. He wants to prove the existence of angels and the afterlife and these five people he currently has are his key to unlocking that mystery. In one of OA’s NDEs she is told by Katoon how she can free herself, and that’s to learn the Five Movements. Each of the captives (except one) are eventually given one movement and when performed together they can open a tunnel through time and space to escape captivity. In the end OA manages to escape only because she was able to run away, leaving her friends in captivity with Hap. By this time they’ve learned the five movements and Hap threatened to use them to take her friends somewhere she’ll never be able to find them. Fast forward to the end of the series, OA has managed to convince the five strangers she met at the beginning of the show that her story is true. They believe what she has to say and they start learning the five movements because OA hopes to use them to help her get back to her friends. The series ends in a startling school shooting that provokes OA and her five friends to try and use the five movements they’ve learned to prevent the shooter from hurting anyone. The manage to finish the movements in spectacular fashion but in the end a school employees knocks down the shooter who fires one last shot that lands in OA’s chest. She’s carted away in the ambulance and we’re left wondering if the five movements were ever really real, or if OA’s story was real at all. This is where people start to hate the show, and for good reason. We’ve just spent seven and a half episodes being told a fantastical story about angels and near death experiences and when the moment of truth comes it all falls flat. Nothing happens. No tunnel opens, time doesn’t freeze, it’s just very anti-climactic. The FBI shows up and shows OA’s friends books about NDEs, the Oligarchs, angels and The Odyssey, all of which OA kept in her room. They’re trying to tell us that this was all fake, that OA was sick and she made the whole thing up. But that’s the genius of it all. Having watched the story from OA’s perspective and seeing things that OA experiences we’re left wondering if it was real. It’s playing on the entire concept of believing in angels. We can choose to believe the power that OA had and her experiences or we can debunk it, leaving it up to coincidence and mental illness. We won’t know if OA’s story was real or not until season 2, if that gets green lit, and that’s why I love it. There are so many things we can dissect about this show and decode that it’s very plausible that OA’s story was actually true and the FBI is trying to cover it up. You can choose to believe that or you can choose to be disappointed in a show that spent 8 hours fooling you. Whatever you decide I think it’s clear that this show has easily been one of Netflix’s most captivating. Do you believe in ‘The OA’?

(AAPL) iPhone Tip: Home Button Would Be Removed in 2017 Next year is the 10th anniversary of the iPhone and Apple seems to have big plans for it Published By: Ken Bock on August 26, 2016 09:49 am EST Facebook Google+ Twitter Pinterest Stumbleupon AAPL Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is tipped again today to launch an iPhone, for the first time, without its signature Home button in 2017. The Home button is as old as it gets for Apple’s mainstream signature touches to its products, but it looks like the Home button’s time might be up as Apple gears up to launch its first iPhone with Organic Light Emitted Diode (OLED) display technology next year. According to a latest report by the Bloomberg, Apple seeks to design the next iPhone so that it looks like a “sheet of glass” on the front. The Home button would, of course, be an obstacle in the way of making the next iPhone look like a sheet of glass on the front, which is why Apple is rumored to be doing away with its long-standing Home button. However, as a consequence of this step, the fingerprint scanner would then have to be integrated into the display itself. Some of the other changes tipped for next year’s major iPhone refresh are an OLED display, introduction of the magnetic Smart Connector, and for the first time, an iPhone with a curved display. An all-glass form-factor has also been spoken of in some rumors, further solidifying the case for Apple’s reported complete redesign of iPhone for 2017. In other news, Bloomberg has also reported that Apple could include Sony’s FeLica chip in its next iPhone that would allow users to pay for their mass-transit fee using their iPhone.

A spokeswoman for the Swedish music-streaming service said a Friday report from Bloomberg that it was tweaking its search engine to punish certain acts was “unequivocally false.” The company declined to comment on other parts of the story, which said that Spotify has told artists their songs won’t be featured on promoted playlists if they sign deals with competitors. The Friday report came after Frank Ocean’s new album “Blonde” debuted exclusively on Apple Music this weekend, where it is expected to remain for the next week or two before becoming available on Spotify. Earlier this week, the release of “Blonde” on Apple Music reportedly spurred an internal announcement from Universal Music Group Chief Executive Lucian Grainge, decreeing that the music major will put a stop to exclusive, long-term streaming deals. The dispute over exclusives comes as Spotify is angling to launch an initial public offering by the end of next year. With about 30 million subscribers, Spotify is currently generating about $2 billion in revenue. Apple Music, which launched little more than a year ago, said in June it has amassed 15 million paying subscribers without disclosing revenue. Spotify still isn’t profitable, according to reports, partly because record labels take about 55 percent of that revenue, as well as an additional cut to publishers. Bloomberg said Spotify also has threatened to retaliate against lesser-known acts who introduce music on Apple’s Beats One streaming radio service.

Daniel Sparks (TMFDanielSparks) Aug 26, 2016 at 8:41PM Are you looking to spice up your portfolio with some dividends? If you're not, think again. There are very good reasons to love dividend stocks, including the income stream they provide investors, the fact that these income streams often grow over time, and the additional possibility of principal appreciation. But finding the right dividend stocks isn't always easy. After all, a high dividend yield doesn't automatically translate into an excellent dividend stock. To make things easier, here are two income-investment ideas for you to consider: McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Image source: McDonald's. Profiting from fast food McDonald's fits the definition of a solid dividend stock, and it's just about as good as any other company in the stock market. Not only does the fast-food company boast a meaningful 3.1% dividend yield -- well over the average dividend yield of companies in the S&P 500 (about 2.1%) -- but the company also boasts an incredible dividend track record. McDonald's has increased its dividend each and every year since paying its first one in 1976 -- a whopping 40 years ago.  During the past five years, McDonald's has impressively increased its dividend by about 9% annually. And the company recently sustained its long track record of dividend increases when it announced in May that it was boosting its quarterly dividend from $0.85 to $0.89. Recently, McDonald's business hasn't been growing very rapidly. With EPS only averaging about 1% annualized growth during the last five years, McDonald's still has room for more dividend increases. The company is currently paying out just 66.4% of its earnings in dividends -- not a bad payout ratio for a company with a 3.1% dividend yield. Tapping into tech's biggest cash cow Apple's dividend yield of 2.1% isn't as impressive as McDonald's 3.1% yield, but Apple's dividend has far more growth potential than the fast-food chain. This is evident by looking at Apple's recent trends in dividend increases. Since Apple reinitiated a dividend in 2012, it has averaged an annual increase of 11.7%. But the growth potential looks even better when considering Apple's very low payout ratio. Apple is currently only paying out 25% of its annual earnings in dividends, leaving huge room for further increases. Image source: The Motley Fool. For investors looking for something close to a guarantee for more increases in the future, Apple management has specifically noted several times that it plans to continue increasing its dividend on an annual basis for years to come. Overall, Apple may not shine when it comes to dividend yield, but it more than makes up for its lack of yield with dividend growth potential. Both Apple and McDonald's are great dividend stocks to consider for investors who are looking for their investments to pay them on a quarterly basis. Personally, I think that these are two of my favorite income investments in the stock market right now. Not only do their dividends look set to pay shareholders a healthy stream of cash over the next 10 years, but the stocks themselves are arguably trading at reasonable valuations. McDonald's and Apple have price-to-earnings ratios of 22 and 12.5, respectively. While McDonald's price-to-earnings ratio of 22 may seem high at first glance, investors should consider the sustainability of a fast-food chain with such a powerful brand: McDonald's cheeseburgers are here to stay. A sustainable, consistently profitable business comes at a price -- and 22 times earnings isn't bad. Daniel Sparks owns shares of Apple. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Apple.

Unfortunately, some users are complaining about an error that would not allow them to access the new beta software. On Friday,  the Cupertino giant released the eighth beta of iOS 10 to developers and the seventh beta of the new mobile OS to public beta testers. The new build for developers is identified as 14A5346a, while the build for public testers is named 14T5329a. Unlike the previous beta releases, however, the newest iOS 10 beta seems to have a shaky rollout, with Apple Insider reporting that the update was met with complaints from users — possibly both developers and public beta testers — claiming that the software could not be found and that their devices alerted them that they were “Unable to Check for Update.” Related Stories Why Apple Is 'Likely' To Use Intel Chips In Future iOS Devices It isn’t clear if the issue has already been addressed as of writing. Nonetheless, Friday’s release is expected to fix certain bugs and issues found in the previous beta versions released by Apple — the same thing that the seventh developer beta came with. The release of the new iOS 10 beta actually hints at the imminent release of the official mobile OS this fall. Per MacRumors, the iOS 10 is a major OS update that should come with new features, like 3D Touch-enabled notifications, a new widgets screen, an overhauled Messages app, an enhanced Photos app and a redesigned Control Center, among many others. MacRumors also stated that the eighth beta of iOS 10 could be the final beta version prior the planned announcement of the iOS 10 this fall. The golden master of iOS 10 is expected to be launched the same day as the public unveiling of Apple’s new iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Apple is also scheduled to launch and release the watchOS 3, macOS Sierra and tvOS 10 sometime this fall. Most Read Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.

World GLOBAL DEVELOPMENT WATCH More companies commit to equal pay pledge on Women’s Equality Day Women's Equality National Monument Associated Press President Barack Obama's limousine sits in front of the newly designated Belmont-Paul Women's Equality National Monument after he spoke there on National Equal Pay Day on April 12.

(Associated Press) Ann M. Simmons Facebook, Apple, and CVS are among 29 companies that on Friday promised to work toward erasing the gender pay gap by signing onto the White House’s Equal Pay Pledge, the Obama administration announced Friday. With the new commitments, more than 50 companies employing millions of people have signed on to the initiative, which was launched in June. Each company has has agreed to conduct a yearly analysis of its pay practices, review hiring and promotion procedures and adopt practices aimed at closing the national gap in pay between men and women, according to the White House. Women make up nearly half the U.S. labor force and increasingly hold positions that traditionally have been occupied by men. Yet in 2014, a woman working full-time year-round in America earned only 79% of what the typical man earned working full-time all year, according to the White House. That figure does not take into account differences in education, experience, occupation, overtime and other factors, but studies have found that gender discrimination explains at least some of the pay gap.

Military and state authorities failed to save a 2-year-old boy from abuse. “No woman should earn less than a man for doing the same job,” Obama said in a proclamation Friday marking Women’s Equality Day, which commemorates the 19th Amendment, which granted women the right to vote. “Equal pay for equal work should be a fundamental principle of our economy and our democracy”. Apple echoed that sentiment in announcing its decision to sign the pledge, saying that over the past year it had examined compensation for its U.S. employees and made progress closing the gaps. “We’ve achieved pay equity in the United States for similar roles and performance,” the company said. “Women employees at Apple earn one dollar for every dollar male employees earn. We’re now analyzing the salaries, bonuses, and annual stock grants of all our employees worldwide. If a gap exists, we’ll address it. And we’ll continue our work to make sure we maintain pay equity.” Facebook said in its pledge that it was “a longtime supporter of equal pay” and for many years had regularly reviewed its compensation practices to ensure pay equity. The Obama administration has lauded the initiative as an example of its commitment to ensure fair pay for all Americans. The president’s first piece of legislation on the issue was the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which was signed into law in 2009 and aims to protect women from pay discrimination. Other companies that signed the pledge on Friday include A.T.

But the release of the album this month, through an exclusive deal with Apple, has also roiled the industry, bringing to the surface long-simmering tensions that record companies have with streaming music services, and sometimes even with their own artists. Within days of the album’s release, a series of revelations about Ocean and “Blonde” emerged that portray a business deeply in flux. Ocean, it seemed, was no longer signed to Def Jam, his record company, when “Blonde” was released. He had apparently fulfilled his contractual agreement with the label with the release of a separate “visual album” the day before “Blonde” came out — a move that cut Def Jam and its corporate parent, Universal Music Group, out of the profits for one of the year’s most-anticipated albums. At the same time, Universal’s management decided to clamp down on the growing practice of releasing new music through exclusive deals with digital outlets like Apple Music and Tidal, a move that reasserted the label’s control over the music its artists produce but also risked alienating top performers who benefit from such promotions. As the industry has struggled to interpret the fallout from “Blonde,” one thing is clear: In the streaming age, the complex series of relationships that the music business relies on to function have become anything but harmonious. “The unprecedented run of exclusives by digital music services has put a tremendous strain on the relationship between artists and their record companies,” said Larry Miller, an associate professor of music business at New York University’s Steinhardt School. “We are seeing that play out in public now.” The details of Ocean’s exit from Def Jam are unclear. But the story began to take shape when fans noticed that the label’s name was nowhere to be found in the credits for “Blonde.” That album had come out just a day after the release of Ocean’s “Endless,” a 46-minute “visual album,” also an Apple Music exclusive. Despite its idiosyncratic format, “Endless” — one long streaming film, whose songs (different from those on “Blonde”) were not available separately — fulfilled Ocean’s contractual obligations to Def Jam, enabling him to release “Blonde” through Apple without any involvement from the label, according to three people with knowledge of Ocean’s deal who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss it publicly. The financial arrangement between Ocean and Apple is not known. Apple, Def Jam and a representative for Ocean’s managers all declined to comment. It was still not known whether a CD version of “Blonde” would be made widely available, and if so, what company would handle its distribution now that Ocean is no longer on the Def Jam roster. (In another twist to the unusual release of “Blonde” — whose cover art spells it “Blond” — a relatively small number of CDs were included with copies of a printed publication called Boys Don’t Cry that were given away for a limited time in pop-up stores in New York and three other cities.) Independence may be particularly attractive to an artist like Ocean, who is revered as an innovator but has been a reclusive and enigmatic figure; he has also complained in the past about Def Jam. But the way “Blonde” was released is viewed as representative of a wider shift in the power dynamics between artists, record labels and technology companies. It follows a year of deals by streaming music companies like Apple and Tidal focused on exclusive album releases. Used by the streaming outlets to attract attention and subscribers, these arrangements — in which an album is available on only one service for a limited period, usually a week or two — have also been viewed by artists as ways to finance new projects, since they often involve a significant financial commitment from the streaming service to pay for videos or other forms of promotion, according to music and talent executives who have negotiated the deals. Over the last year, major albums by Beyoncé, Drake, Kanye West, Dr. Dre, Rihanna, Future and DJ Khaled were released first through exclusive streaming deals of various kinds. Apple has carved out a particular role in paying for videos by stars like Drake, the Weeknd and Taylor Swift. But deals like these have also often irritated fans, since they sequester music on a particular subscription service — even if only for a limited time. Record labels also often dislike them because they limit sales and frequently lead to piracy. They are also seen as examples of digital services interfering in the labels’ relationships with artists, a connection that in decades past was absolute but has already been chipped away by declining record sales and the rise of the concert business as a major source of revenue for artists. The tide may be turning against exclusives, at least from the perspective of the labels. After the release of Ocean’s album, Lucian Grainge, the chairman of Universal Music Group, sent a private memo to top executives at the company’s labels calling for an end to long-term exclusive deals with a single service, according to a person who has seen the memo but spoke on the condition of anonymity because it was an internal document. Yet that edict may still leave the company plenty of room to negotiate more limited deals with digital services. A spokesman for Universal declined to comment. Executives at two major record labels said that Spotify, which has resisted exclusives, had recently told them that it had instituted a policy that music that had benefited from such deals on other services would not receive the same level of promotion once it arrived on Spotify; such music may not be as prominently featured or included in as many playlists, said these executives, who spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to discuss private negotiations. Spotify declined to comment. Others in the music world have called for a truce between labels and digital services when it comes to online distribution, particularly when it concerns young artists like Ocean, who at 28 has no experience with the record industry before its digital disruption. “Artists want to be fully empowered to control their careers, and they don’t want the old school to tell them what to do,” said Doug Davis, a music industry lawyer. “Ultimately there has to be a resolution between the major labels and the artists that allows them to control their destinies and cash in on the financial opportunities that are out there.” Latest from the SFGATE homepage: Click below for the top news from around the Bay Area and beyond.

The logo of the Israeli NSO Group company is displayed on a building where they had offices until few months ago in Herzliya, Israel, Thursday, Aug. 25, 2016. A botched attempt to break into the iPhone of an Arab activist using hitherto unknown espionage software has trigged a global upgrade of Apple's mobile operating system, researchers said Thursday. (Photo: Daniella Cheslow, AP) SAN FRANCISCO — The spyware firm tied to an iPhone hack that prompted an emergency patch this week by Apple keeps a very low profile. But the NSO Group has strong ties here as well as in Israel, where it's staffed by specialists from Israel's military cyber division. One of its recent owners, U.S. private equity firm Francisco Partners, operates from an office complex in San Francisco's leafy Presidio district that's also home to Lucasfilm and Industrial Light & Magic. In Herzelia, an area of near Tel Aviv with a thriving tech culture, NSO was founded by Shalev Hulio and Omri Lavie in 2009, according to HulioandLavie's LinkedIn pages. Several of its employees previously worked for United 8200, the Israeli Army's cyber division, which is known to produce spying software. The tech company's background, pieced together from industry reports, reflects the growing boom in cybersecurity firms that operate in a nebulous area: creating software and processes that break into encrypted devices for government entities. NSO is described itself as "a leader in the field of Cyber warfare," according to an apparent  company brochure posted online by Privacy International. Human rights activist Ahmed Mansoor shows Associated Press journalists a screenshot of a spoof text message he received in Ajman, United Arab Emirates, on Thursday, Aug. 25, 2016. Mansoor was recently targeted by spyware that can hack into Apple's iPhone handset. The company said Thursday it was updated its security. The text message reads: "New secrets on the torture of Emirati citizens in jail."  (Photo: AP Photo/Jon Gambrell) The company uses "a powerful and unique monitoring tool, called Pegasus, which allows remote and stealth monitoring and full data extraction from remote target devices via untraceable commands," says the brochure. While these hacks can be legal under the laws of the country buying the product, they raise severe privacy worries from consumer groups. They also highlight concerns that increasingly rigorous encryption from Apple and other consumer tech companies is vulnerable to attacks funded by deep-pocked entities. “What most people don’t understand about espionage these days is just how dramatically sophisticated the technologies to conduct this kind of intelligence gathering have become," said Michael McFaul, director of the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies at Stanford University and the former U.S. Ambassador to Russia. Cybersecurity firms that can thwart encryption shot into the spotlight earlier this year when the FBI hired an unnamed private contractor to help it hack into the contents of the iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino shooters. The successful hack allowed the U.S. government to shelve a contentious fight with Apple, which did not want to provide a software override to its mobile operating system. The NSO Group is rare “because it’s one company that’s gotten caught,” said Eva Galperin, a global policy analyst with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights group in San Francisco. "There’s still a lot of light to be shed on this world,” she said. Suspicious text Its involvement, according to researchers who published findings on the spyware and notified Apple, was traced to the software's coding. Ahmed Mansoor, a prominent human rights activist in the United Arab Emirates, told University of Toronto's Citizen Lab he was sent a suspicious SMS link. Working with mobile security firm  Lookout, Citizen Lab said the link carried a powerful, rare form of spyware that could have cost as much as $1 million. If Mansoor had clicked on it, it would have given the sender the ability to  control his phone's camera and microphone, track his movements and rifle through all his apps, files and contacts, they said. NSO Group spokesman Zamir Dahbash, reached by email, would not confirm or deny involvement in the Mansoor spyware. He said: “NSO’s mission is to help make the world a safer place, by providing authorized governments with technology that helps them combat terror and crime." Apple said it immediately fixed the vulnerability upon learning of it. On Thursday it advised customers to download the latest version of its iOS, version 9.3.5, for security protection. Citizen Lab's John Scott-Railton said a likely suspect for the attempted attack was the United Arab Emirates, where Mansoor is seen as a dissident. He has been unable to leave the country since 2011 after his passport was taken. A representative for the UAE did not return a request for comment. USA TODAY Apple issues security update to prevent iPhone spyware U.S. owned NSO Group has an extremely low profile. The company does not have a web page.  On its LinkedIn page, it is described as working "in the field of Internet security software solutions and security research." No contact information is listed. In 2014, Francisco Partners bought a majority stake. The private equity company, founded by West Coast investment banking pioneer Sanford Robertson and run by former Texas Pacific Group investor Dipanjan Deb, did not respond to requests for comment. Among its 75 portfolio companies, it does not list NSO as an investment. In November, Bloomberg reported NSO was exploring a sale that would value it at close to $1 billion. According to a Reuters report last year, NSO Group had annual earnings of around $75 million. Human rights activist Ahmed Mansoor shows Associated Press journalists a screenshot of a spoof text message he received in Ajman, United Arab Emirates, on Thursday, Aug. 25, 2016.  (Photo: (AP Photo/Jon Gambrell)) If the software was produced, sold and used outside of the United States, there would be no U.S. jurisdiction over it, said Robert Cattanach, a partner at Dorsey & Whiney who specializes in cyber security law. If it had been used inside of the United States, the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act would apply, but that doesn’t appear to have happened here, he said. “These materials are for sale to the highest bidder,” said Cattenach, a former U.S. Department of Justice attorney. USA TODAY Apple to offer up to $200K for security bugs Spyware vs. privacy Some suggest the availability of software such as that produced by the NSO Group is at least partly due to technology firms’ reluctance  to provide a backdoor to law enforcement to increasingly sophisticated encryption. "We are at this place because of law enforcement frustration with access to data in investigations. And so we are going to continue to see law enforcement agencies, even from legitimate democratic states, buying 'hacking tools' so that crimes that occur within their own borders can be investigated," said Chris Hoofnagle, a professor of cyber crime law at the University of California, Berkeley. Apple's refusal to break into the San Bernardino iPhone "forced the FBI to buy a million-dollar exploit from a company in the same market space as NSO because that was the only way to get access to the San Bernardino killers’ phone. So Apple has helped create this market,” said Stewart Baker, a partner in the Washington office of Steptoe & Johnson. A spokesperson for Apple was not immediately available for comment. 366 CONNECTTWEET 26 LINKEDIN 7 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2bvn8lI NEVER MISS OUT Tech Be the earliest adopter.

Apple updates iPhone security after cyber attack Technology Saturday 27 August 2016 - 1:27am File: Apple iPhone users were encouraged to instal a security upgrade after a cyber-attack. Photo: ADR Studios SAN FRANCISCO – Apple iPhone owners on Friday were urged to instal a quickly released security update after a sophisticated attack on an Emirate dissident exposed vulnerabilities targeted by cyber arms dealers. Researchers at Lookout mobile security firm and Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto said they uncovered a fierce, three-pronged cyber-attack targeting a dissident's iPhone "that subverts even Apple's strong security environment." Lookout and Citizen Lab worked with Apple on an iOS patch to defend against what was called "Trident" because of its triad of attack methods, the researchers said in a joint blog post. "We were made aware of this vulnerability and immediately fixed it with iOS 9.3.5," Apple said in a released statement. Trident is used in spyware referred to as Pegasus, which a Citizen Lab investigation showed was made by an Israel-based organisation called NSO Group. It was acquired by the US firm Francisco Partners Management six years ago, according to Lookout and Citizen. Lookout referred to Pegasus as the most sophisticated attack it has seen, sneakily accessing calls, cameras, email, passwords, apps and more on iPhones. The spyware was detected when used against Ahmed Mansoor, a human rights activist in the United Arab Emirates, who has been repeatedly targeted using spyware. - Phishing scheme - After receiving a suspicious text with a link, he reported the matter to Citizen Lab, which worked in conjunction with San Francisco-based Lookout to research the affair. "The attack sequence, boiled down, is a classic phishing scheme: send text message, open web browser, load page, exploit vulnerabilities, install persistent software to gather information," the joint blog post said. "This, however, happens invisibly and silently, such that victims do not know they’ve been compromised." Mansoor received text messages on August 10 and 11 promising that secrets about detainees being tortured in UAE jails could be accessed by clicking on an enclosed link, researchers said. Had he fallen for the ruse, the Trident chain of "zero-day exploits" would have broken into his iPhone and installed snooping software. Once infected, Mansoor's iPhone would have been turned into a "spy in his pocket" capable of tracking his whereabouts and conversations, Citizen Lab said. Mansoor was targeted five years ago with FinFisher spyware and again the following year with Hacking Team spyware, according to Citizen Lab research. "The use of such expensive tools against Mansoor shows the lengths that governments are willing to go to target activists," the researchers said. Although the cyber-attack on Mansoor was not linked to a specific government, Citizen Lab said indicators pointed to the UAE. UAE authorities did not comment on the matter. Lookout and Citizen believe the spyware has been "in the wild for a significant amount of time." "It is also being used to attack high-value targets for multiple purposes, including high-level corporate espionage on iOS, Android and Blackberry." Citizen Lab has also found evidence that "state-sponsored actors" used NSO weapons against a Mexican journalist who reported on high-level corruption in that country and on an unknown target in Kenya. The NSO tactics included impersonating sites such as the International Committee of the Red Cross, the British government's visa application processing website, and a wide range of news organisations and major technology companies, the researchers said. - Cyber arms dealers - Mansoor's decision to enlist Citizen Lab instead of falling into the trap gave researchers a rare chance to expose the work of "shady cyber arms dealers" who command high prices for morally questionable services, Lookout vice president of security research Mike Murray told AFP. Invoices posted online have shown that hackers can charge tens of thousands of dollars per target hit with their software. "The smart phone is a valuable target, and breaking into it is a valuable skill set," Murray said. "People who can do this, and with wiggle room in their moral code, have realised the business opportunity." NSO Group has been around since 2010 and the capture of one of its weapons was billed as a first. Studying Trident has helped cyber defenders find ways to spot spyware that had been operating unseen, and they are "actively catching it in the wild now," Murray said. He declined to reveal anything about other targets, saying that they were people likely to be under surveillance in other ways by local authorities. Citizen Lab saw the attack on Mansoor as further evidence that "lawful intercept" spyware has significant abuse potential, and that some governments can't resist the temptation to use such tools against political opponents, journalists and human rights defenders.   AFP Comment Now!

Researchers at Lookout mobile security firm and Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto said they uncovered a fierce, three-pronged cyber attack targeting a dissident’s iPhone “that subverts even Apple’s strong security environment.” Lookout and Citizen Lab worked with Apple on an iOS patch to defend against what was called “Trident” because of its triad of attack methods, the researchers said in a joint blog post. “We were made aware of this vulnerability and immediately fixed it with iOS 9.3.5,” Apple said in a released statement. Trident is used in spyware referred to as Pegasus, which a Citizen Lab investigation showed was made by an Israel-based organization called NSO Group. It was acquired by the US firm Francisco Partners Management six years ago, according to Lookout and Citizen. Lookout referred to Pegasus as the most sophisticated attack it has seen, sneakily accessing calls, cameras, email, passwords, apps and more on iPhones. The spyware was detected when used against Ahmed Mansoor, a human rights activist in the United Arab Emirates, who has been repeatedly targeted using spyware. Phishing scheme After receiving a suspicious text with a link, he reported the matter to Citizen Lab, which worked in conjunction with San Francisco-based Lookout to research the affair. “The attack sequence, boiled down, is a classic phishing scheme: send text message, open web browser, load page, exploit vulnerabilities, install persistent software to gather information,” the joint blog post said. “This, however, happens invisibly and silently, such that victims do not know they’ve been compromised.” Mansoor received text messages on August 10 and 11 promising that secrets about detainees being tortured in UAE jails could be accessed by clicking on an enclosed link, researchers said. Had he fallen for the ruse, the Trident chain of “zero-day exploits” would have broken into his iPhone and installed snooping software.
