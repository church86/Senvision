Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile 5 ways Android has taken Apple’s ideas and made them better Image Source: Ng Han Guan/AP/REX/Shutterstock Zach Epstein @zacharye February 7th, 2017 at 11:44 AM Share Tweet Apple’s iOS platform and Google’s Android platform both emerged at around the same time a decade ago, but there’s precious little question that one platform in particular was steering the ship in the early days. Google’s Android team had been hard at work building a boring BlackBerry clone, but Google did something that other platform makers failed at miserably. Google took one look at the iPhone Apple unveiled in early 2007 and it instantly knew it was cloning the wrong mobile experience. Meanwhile, big cell phone companies like Nokia, BlackBerry and Microsoft kept chugging along without adapting at all. Google’s reworked Android platform would launch commercially in late 2008 on the HTC Dream/G1, and it wisely resembled Apple’s iPhone far more than it resembled a BlackBerry phone. In the years that followed, Apple and Google would go on to overtake the global cell phone market as other platforms floundered and failed. It’s clear that iOS and Android took inspiration from each other every step of the way, but in this post we’ll look at five ways in particular that Android took Apple’s ideas from the iPhone and made them even better in Android. Don't Miss: The one way Android will never, ever be able to compete with the iPhone High-resolution displays Just like the touchscreen itself, high-resolution displays have become ubiquitous and as a result, it can be difficult to remember a time before smartphone displays became as sophisticated as they are right now. But it all began in 2010, when Apple started a pixel war with the Retina display on the iPhone 4. Today, nearly seven years later, Apple smartphones have the lowest resolution among all flagship devices. Now, it’s important to note that while Apple had been lagging far behind market leaders like Samsung for years when it comes to display quality, the screens on the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus have narrowed the gap substantially. Although resolution hasn’t improved on either device, other improvements and support for a wider color gamut have brought Apple’s iPhones closer in display quality to AMOLED panels from the likes of Samsung. App Store No, Android doesn’t have better apps than iOS. In fact, the gap in user experience and overall app quality between the two platforms is just as wide now as it has been for years. While Android affords developers far more flexibility, iOS apps are alway smoother and they offer a much more consistent experience. Where app stores are concerned, iOS and Android each have their pros and cons where app distribution is concerned — the Play Store is cluttered and confusing at times, while search is still awful in the iOS App Store — but there’s one area where Android just leapt ahead of Apple by a huge margin: Instant Apps. The new Instant Apps feature google unveiled last year during its annual I/O developer conference is a stroke of genius. In a nutshell, it allows developers to turn a portion of their apps into web apps that can be accessed instantly without any need to purchase or even download an application. So for example, a person can begin using a portion of a paid app instantly without making any purchase. Then, a purchase can be made if the person wants to keep using the app beyond a certain point. Quick Settings Android has always had some settings available in the pull-down “shade” menu, but it wasn’t until Apple’s Control Panel came around that Google stepped things up and created the versatile quick settings panel users enjoy today. Different vendors have made a wide range of tweaks to the Quick Settings menu in their various Android builds, but the endgame is the same: Users have easy access to a customizable menu that allows them to tweak more than a dozen settings from any screen. One of the most frustrating things about the Control Panel in iOS is that it is not customizable. So, if there are settings you access constantly that aren’t included in the Control Panel, you’re just out of luck. Android, meanwhile, has a much wider range of settings that are accessible on the Quick Settings menu. What’s more, the menu is customizable so you can remove settings you don’t often use, add settings you want to be able to configure, and rearrange items in any order of your choosing. Keyboards Apple’s virtual keyboard on the iPhone was a complete game changer, but there’s little question that Apple has been lapped at this point. First and foremost, third-party keyboard support in iOS is still horrendous. Apple’s keyboard offers a terrific typing experience thanks to a great design and class-leading touch response on iPhones and iPads, but people often want more than that. For example, swipe-style typing is hugely popular and Apple’s keyboard doesn’t support it. There are also third-party keyboard with better emoji functionality and dozens of other features that are nowhere to be found on the built-in iOS keyboard. But third-party options are severely constrained, keyboard support is buggy at best. Android, meanwhile, has a terrific built-in keyboard but it also gives third-party developers the freedom to access all of the OS features and functions they want. The result is a keyboard experience that feels and functions like a fully integrated OEM keyboard. Software Updates Software updates? Really?! Apple still gets updates out faster since it releases updates directly to end users rather than to vendor partners, but Android Nougat’s new update mechanism is brilliant. Instead of having to stop everything you’re doing to update your smartphone running Android 7.0 or later, software updates are downloaded in the background over Wi-Fi while you use the phone. Once the download is complete, everything still happens in the background because the new Android build installs to a special separate partition. Then, the next time the phone is rebooted, the new software version boots and the update it done — that’s it.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Security Image Source: Jonathan Geller, BGR Some popular iPhone apps might be secretly leaking your information Chris Smith @chris_writes February 7th, 2017 at 7:30 PM Share Tweet Apple’s iPhone is more secure than its rivals, but that doesn’t mean that apps or the device itself can’t be hacked. A security researcher discovered a flaw in some 76 App Store apps with more than 18 million downloads between them that would allow a malicious individual to capture certain data from the iPhone. The security issue can’t be fixed by Apple directly. Instead, each developer should handle with extra care network-related code that might interfere with Apple’s default practices for transporting data over a secured connection. Don't Miss: The Mars rover just sent back data that has scientists completely stumped Will Strafach used his verify.ly service to discover 76 applications that can be leak data about yourself. The security exploit takes advantage of a data transfer protocol that might be misconfigured in certain apps. A security feature introduced by Apple in iOS 9 called App Transport Security feature is meant to force app data transfers over secured HTTPS. But misconfigured network code in an iOS app can fool the ATS protocol to see a connection as TLS-protected (HTTPS) even when it’s not. A hacker with knowledge of the issue would be able to siphon off data from an iPhone over a Wi-Fi connection. Strafach divided the 76 apps into three categories, including low-risk (33 apps), medium-risk (24 apps), and high-risk (19 apps). A high-risk app would leak financial or medical service login credentials and session authentication tokens for logged users. A medium-risk app would let the hacker intercept login credentials and session authentication tokens for logged in users. Low-risk apps would leak partially sensitive data about the device, including email address and login credentials. The researcher posted the 33 low-risk apps he discovered complete with information on what kind of information hackers can steal. For example, Snap Upload for Snapchat would give a hacker the username and password to Snapchat — check out the full list at this link. Strafach did not share the medium- and high-risk apps and chose to reach out to affected “banks, medical providers, and other developers of sensitive applications which are vulnerable,” before identifying them. He will post more information about them in 60 to 90 days. The same problem affected Experian in 2016 and PayPal in 2010. The attacks, however, aren’t exactly simple, and they require knowledge of the issue, specialized equipment, and proximity to a target who must have installed on his or her device vulnerable apps. What you can do until then is to avoid connecting to any untrusted Wi-Fi network for any sensitive data exchanges, such as internet banking sessions. Choose cellular data instead, which would make it nearly impossible for a hacker to intercept the same data. Of course, if hackers are targeting you for any reason, then you might have some bigger problems to deal with than worrying about what Wi-Fi network to trust when you’re not at home.

Mobile 4 0 0 February 10, 2017 iPhone X With Over $1000 Price Tag To Feature Wireless Charging & OLED Screen? Venus Montalbo Apple will reportedly release three versions of iPhones this 2017 and one of them – rumored to be the special 10th-anniversary edition – will have a price tag north of a thousand U.S. dollars. The long-standing speculations about Apple’s next iPhone models are saying that the upcoming releases will include the iPhone 7S, the iPhone 7S Plus and the anniversary model, the iPhone 8, which is also unofficially referred to as the iPhone X. A post from Fast Company described the iPhone X to be the “ultimate iPhone” as it is expected to feature very high-end specs. So if the iPhone X’ specs will be too advanced; tech fans can also anticipate a significant price hike from the Apple smartphone. The iPhone X or the iPhone 8’s price is most likely to be set for more than $1,000, Fast Company reported citing “a source with knowledge of Apple’s plans.” Considering the price tags of the recent iPhone models and the expected specs and features of the iPhone 8, one can easily assume that Apple will offer a costlier tenth-anniversary iOS phone. [Image by Spencer Platt/Getty Images] The iPhone 7 Plus, for instance, with 256GB storage is available for $969 in the United States or €1,119 in Europe, according to GSM Arena. As for the specs, the iPhone X could be a 5.8-inch iOS handset with OLED touchscreen and could sport a “button-free design with an edge-to-edge OLED screen with the home button somehow built in,” the report added. Moreover, the iPhone 8’s side buttons could be substituted by “touch-sensitive inlays in a metal frame with a glass back,” Engadget explained. Talking more about the possible iPhone X design, Fast Company shared the following. “As rumored, the sides of the iPhone 8 will likely be made of forged stainless steel, a less expensive material than the aluminum used in current iPhones. The back of the iPhone 8 is expected to be made of glass rather than metal, our source says, confirming previous reports.” Apple’s 2017 top-of-the-line smartphone could also feature the 3D-sensing technology from Lumentum, which could be applied in various functions including facial recognition, enhanced camera performance by providing better image resolution, and for augmented reality features. What do you think of this iPhone 8 concept? https://t.co/AGQhPapabs pic.twitter.com/TLH3sU8qdJ — TAXI (@designtaxi) February 6, 2017 Furthermore, there’s a recent news update which strengthens speculations that the three iPhone models in 2017, including the iPhone X, will sport a wireless charging functionality as one of its features. Popular analyst, Ming-Chi Kuo, who noted that wireless charging increases smartphone’s internal temperate, explained how the Cupertino-based tech giant will prevent the iPhone 8 from failing because of overheating. MacRumors cited the following statement from Kuo’s research notes. “While we don’t expect general users to notice any difference, lamination of an additional graphite sheet is needed for better thermal control and, thus, steady operation; this is because FPCB is replaced with film, which is more sensitive to temperature change of the 3D touch sensor in OLED iPhone.” Unlike the iPhone 8, which is expected to sport an OLED screen, the two other upcoming iPhone models, the 4.7-inch iPhone 7s and the 5.5-inch iPhone 7s Plus are said to be equipped with LCD displays. Meanwhile, when it comes to camera specs, a dual-lens primary snapper can be expected from both the iPhone 7s Plus and the iPhone X. As for possible release timeframe, there are rumors that the iPhone 8, alongside iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus could arrive earlier than the usual launch pattern. However, Fast Company believes that Apple won’t be doing so and will instead stick to its release tradition, announcing its new smartphone products in the fall. Are you excited to see Apple’s iPhones for 2017? Here’s one of the most recent iPhone concept videos posted on YouTube. The Inquisitr will keep you in the loop for more release, price tag and specs rumors about the alleged iPhone 7s, iPhone 7s Plus and iPhone 8.

(AAPL) Take a deep breath - AAPL is not replacing the iPhone’s Lightning port with UAC By Brad Moon, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Feb 7, 2017, 9:21 am EST     View All   Popular Posts: Report: Apple Inc. iPhone 8 Could Cost More Than $1,000 (AAPL) Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Prime Air Drones Surprise in Super Bowl Ad No, Apple Inc. Is Not Releasing the iPhone 8 Early Recent Posts: Alphabet Inc. Takes Another Shot at Amazon With Home Control No, Apple Inc. Is Not Releasing the iPhone 8 Early Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Finally Fires Back at Apple With Android Wear 2.0 View All Posts One of the biggest PR headaches for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is connectors. Last year, the company ditched the 3.5 mm headphone jack on the iPhone 7, then eliminated virtually every legacy port in favor of USB-C on the new MacBook Pro. Those moves required a slew of dongles, adapters and connectors, generating a litany of complaints. Source: Amazon When news broke yesterday that the company was adding support for a new Ultra Accessory Connector — or UAC — panic ensued. Smaller than either USB-C or Lightning, speculation that AAPL might be preparing to switch to UAC quickly spread. Apple fans (and accessory makers) can take a deep breath. AAPL has confirmed Ultra Accessory Connector is the new name for an old standard, and it’s adding UAC to its MFi (Made-for-iPhone) program at the request of headphone manufacturers. The Ultra Accessory Connector Speculation that AAPL might surprise everyone with a new Apple port began with a 9to5Mac report. The site uncovered a developer preview with support for a new Ultra Accessory Connector that “in some cases will replace the use of Lightning and USB connectors.” UAC is smaller than both USB-C and Apple’s own Lightning port. Naturally, given AAPL’s laser focus on making its devices thinner, that rapidly ramped up speculation the company could be preparing to move the iPhone and iPad to UAC from Lightning. The Verge was quick to chase down the UAC story. According to its sources, the Ultra Accessory Connector is not part of a plan to introduce a new Apple port. Instead, it’s the official name for an old connector that has been in use by various companies. For example, Nikon Corp (ADR) (OTCMKTS:NINOY) uses it as a connectivity option with digital cameras. The Verge says that headphone manufacturers asked AAPL to add support for the Ultra Accessory Connector in its MFi program. Why the Panic Over UAC? AAPL has gained a reputation for ditching existing ports for new versions, especially when that new Apple port is smaller, letting it shrink its devices. AAPL fans have been particularly riled up over the last six months. First came the decision to eliminate the 3.5 mm headphone jack in the iPhone 7 in favor of Lightning or wireless headphones. Next, when Apple released the long-awaited new MacBook Pro, it replaced all legacy ports with the new USB-C. Those decisions have meant the expense and inconvenience of dongles and adapters to make old accessories work.

And 2017 is shaping up as a banner year for such speculation—with good reason. The iPhone produces the vast majority of the company’s revenue and profit.

Apple iPhone 5s offers on Valentine’s Day: Is this deal worth it? Apple is advertising the iPhone 5s as the ultimate gift on Valentine's Day, but should you fall for this deal? By: Tech Desk | Updated: February 11, 2017 12:14 pm Apple iPhone 5s will get you Rs 6000 cashback on Valentine’s Day: Should you take this deal? Valentine’s Day is this Tuesday – and many of you may be thinking to gift either the iPhone 7 or the iPhone 7 Plus. But, Apple thinks the best gift this Valentine’s Day is the iPhone 5s. Well, don’t be surprised to see to the full page ad in one of the leading news dailies this morning, where the centre of attraction is the now-dated iPhone 5s. So, what’s the deal? Apple has partnered with HDFC Bank to provide cashback offers on purchase of the iPhone 5s. The company is offering a cashback of up to Rs 6,000. The special offer is valid on all HDFC Bank Debit and Credit cards. According to the terms and conditions, the cashback will be credited to a customer’s accounts within 90 days of the purchase. The offer is live and will be valid till February 14, 2017. Watch all our videos from Express Technology The important point to note is that a cashback of Rs 2,000 is also applicable on all Debit and Credit cards from various banks. The following banks are: American Express, Axis Bank, Citi bank, HSBC, ICICI, Indusind Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, RBL Bank, Standard Charted, SBI cards, Union Bank and Yes Bank. Users should note the Rs 2,000 cashback is not valid on Debit Cards of American Express, SBI and Union Bank. Financing offers are available from Bajaj Finance and Capital First. The iPhone 5s is the cheapest model and thus, it’s going to be a tempting deal. For Rs 18,994, you’re getting the iPhone, not any smartphone. But it’s far from perfect. Here are some of the reasons why you should avoid getting the iPhone 5s right now. First and foremost, the 16GB iPhone 5s doesn’t make sense, given the little space you are getting. Apps, games movies, photos and videos will mean you’ll run out of space pretty soon. Since Apple doesn’t allow users to expand the internal memory, it’s going to be a big problem. Also read: Apple iPhone 6 at Rs 23,990 with exchange on Flipkart: But is it worth it? Plus given the iPhone 5s is a three year old phone, you might not be upgraded to iOS 11, which Apple plans to release in the coming months. Being a new owner of the iPhone 5s, missing out on the new OS won’t be such good news.  The iPhone 5s was launched nearly four years back (September 2013 to be precise), so it looks a bit dated. Basically, you’ll be paying for the brand and most importantly, for a phone that is already obsolete. Butt if you’ve been dreaming of getting an iPhone for less than Rs 20,000, then the iPhone 5s is a good bet. The plus point with Apple devices: even when they are outdated, they continue to work just as well. Don’t expect performance to be an issue on the iPhone 5s. The 8MP camera on the iPhone 5s is also one of the better cameras in this price range. Also if you plan to upgrade to a new phone in the coming months, the iPhone will fetch a higher price on the exchange rate. But if you are willing to shell out Rs 20,000 for a new phone which you wish to gift to your loved one, you can consider a number of options, many of which sport much better specifications. For example, Lenovo Z2 Plus is a great smartphone, with a Snapdragon 820 processor, 4GB RAM, a Full HD display and superior battery life. The phone runs on Android, and is priced at Rs 17,499. The Samsung Galaxy A5 (2016) is another notable option in the similar price bracket. An iPhone might seem like the ultimate gift to flaunt on Valentine’s Day, but an iPhone 5s is a little dated. If you’re on a tight budget, and Apple is all you wish to give, then you can take it, especially if you’re getting the Rs 6000 cashback. But otherwise, the market does have a lot of other options in this price range, which you can consider for gifting. © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd Tags: Apple Election 2017 Uttar Pradesh Assembly Elections 2017 Phase 1 Live Updates: Polling begins in 73 constituencies of western region UP Assembly Elections 2017: Battle for heartland begins in west that may hold the key UP Assembly Elections 2017: Day before first phase, Muslim clerics back Mayawati Best of Express Setback for Sasikala as TN education minister Pandiarajan joins Panneerselvam camp EntertainmentJolly LLB 2 movie review : Akshay Kumar, Saurabh Shukla make this an unalloyed delight EntertainmentShah Rukh Khan, Aamir Khan's first selfie in 25 years is one of a kind.

Esteemed KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has suggested we can expect all three rumored iPhone 8 models to feature inductive charging. Kuo further notes wireless charging is also likely to land on the refreshed iPhone 7 versions slated to arrive this fall. “This event was off the charts” Gary Vaynerchuk was so impressed with TNW Conference 2016 he paused mid-talk to applaud us. FIND OUT WHY The KGI expert claims the addition of wireless charging could result in higher production costs. Since wireless charging has been known to increase the temperature of the handsets, Kuo predicts Apple’s upcoming phones will likely feature an upgraded 3D Touch module with “additional graphite sheet lamination” to prevent overheating. MacRumors has obtained a copy of Kuo’s notes: While we don’t expect general users to notice any difference, lamination of an additional graphite sheet is needed for better thermal control and, thus, steady operation; this is because FPCB is replaced with film, which is more sensitive to temperature change of the 3D touch sensor in OLED iPhone. This speculation aligns with other recent reports suggesting the forthcoming iPhone 8 could be Apple’s most expensive handset yet, with rumors hinting the price could be over $1,000 for the premium model. While other phone-makers like Samsung and LG have already integrated wireless charging into some of their devices, Apple is yet to do the same with its iPhones. Taking into account that back in September leaked Apple patents suggested the company is working on its own inductive wireless charging gadgets, it seems this time around we might finally see the technology make it to market.

Advertisement Millions of phones get lost or stolen constantly, and usually there’s not much you can do about it other than to try and go back and find it. If it’s stolen, you’re kind of out of luck, unless you can find a way to somehow locate it and get it back from the perpetrator. Luckily, phone manufacturers are adding ways for owners to track and manage their phones if they ever do get lost or stolen, giving users a fighting chance at least. There are a handful of things that you’ll need to keep in mind and make sure that you do whenever your iPhone does end up stolen. Many users simply resort to tracking their stolen device using Find My iPhone, but don’t spend too much time trying to track down the device and the criminal, as there are other tasks that you need to do if you’re iPhone gets stolen. Here’s a list of tasks that you should do (in no particular order) when you discover that your iPhone has been stolen. Track It With Find My iPhone Find My iPhone is a service that comes free with every iOS device and Mac computer, and it allows you to track your iPhone, whether it was lost or stolen. Of course, it only works when the phone is on and it has a signal, so if your phone gets stolen and the thief was smart enough to turn off the phone or put it in Airplane Mode, Find My iPhone won’t work, but it’ll at least give you a fighting chance. Here’s how to use it. Advertisement Head to iCloud.com and log in using your Apple ID information. You’ll be greeted with a handful of apps arranged similarly to how your iPhone home screen looks like. Click on the Find My iPhone icon and you’ll be taken to a full-screen map with dots representing where your various Apple devices are located (including Mac computers, if you have any). You can click on Devices at the top to view all of your Apple devices, and when you select your stolen one, you’ll have the same three options as the Find My iPhone app: Play Sounds, Lost Mode and Erase iPhone. Personally, using Find My iPhone would be the first thing I do, but again, don’t spend a lot of time fiddling around with it. Instead, quickly log on and see if you can track your iPhone, if you know it’s location, close out of Find My iPhone and move on to the next step. Call the Police & File a Report Be sure to call the police and not only file a report, but also tell them that you know the location of the stolen device if you know where it is from Find My iPhone. If that’s the case, they’ll usually send an officer out to help retrieve the stolen iPhone and catch the perp. Under no circumstances should you pursue the perp on your own, as you have no idea what they’re capable of. Let the police handle it. Advertisement Otherwise, there is very little that the police can do, but filing a report can help when dealing with Apple, your carrier, or insurance company. Remotely Erase Your Stolen iPhone At this point, if you can’t locate your stolen iPhone and the police can’t help you find it, you’re probably at the point where you’ll never see it again, which is why it would be a good time to remotely wipe your stolen iPhone if you can using iCloud and Find My iPhone. Like before when you logged into iCloud.com to try and locate your stolen iPhone, there is an option to remotely wipe your device, called Erase iPhone. Clicking that will remote wipe your device so that the thief can’t access any personal information. This is ideal if you have sensitive information on your iPhone. However, keep in mind that erasing your stolen iPhone will prevent you from using Find My iPhone to locate the device in the future. At this point, it’s officially time to say, “bye bye.” Advertisement Call Your Carrier After you remote-wiped your iPhone, be sure to call your mobile carrier to cancel service on the iPhone, that way if the thief can access your device, you won’t rack up any charges for text messages and calls made by the thief, and will instead shut down service and prevent him from making calls and sending text messages. Plus, if you have a police report that you can show the carrier, they’ll be more likely to work with you and take action quicker than they would normally. You usually have to prove it was stolen anyway in order for the carrier to take action, and the police report you filed will do the trick. 17 Responses 02/12/2015 Larry Reply This site G2BM is so stupid now why post topics that most people know??

The post has since been taken down, but initially included the caption: “How did I end up in the studio with Dr Dre ON THE night his deal went public that he did with Apple 3.2 BILLION!!!!! The BEATS HEADPHONES JUST CHANGED HIP HOP!!!!!!” WATCH: The New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Financial Times reported the story Thursday citing sources briefed on the talks. Beats by Dre headphones‘ annual sales revenues have reportedly gone up to $1.5 billion since the company was founded with music executive Jimmy Iovine began selling headphones in 2008. The deal would include the new Beats Music streaming service, which Apple is likely acquiring to compete with streaming services like Pandora and Spotify after the company’s iTunes Radio failed to impress the industry. Apple’s revenue growth has declined sharply in recent years, and the company only entered the broadly popular streaming market last year — late because of former CEO Steve Jobs’ reported unfavorable opinion of music subscription services. The company continues to be the largest seller of music downloads, but is losing market share to companies like Amazon. Purchasing Beats would mark Apple’s largest acquisition ever. The headphones retail between about $169.95 to $449.95, depending on model and features, and despite many music and sound industry experts describing their quality as “extraordinarily bad,” the brand has become enormously popular as a fashion item among a younger consumer base, and the popular alternative to standard earbuds models. Beats’ success is due in large part to its wide profit margins – despite the steep prices of the popular bass-heavy headphone models, each individual unit reportedly only costs around $14 to produce. Private equity firm Carlyle Group invested $500 million in Beats last year, and valued the company at more than $1 billion. Neither Apple nor Beats would comment on the deal in the original reports, and the briefed sources said they were still in the negotiation stage. Though the companies have yet to consummate the agreement, and it could still fall through, if things go as planned the official announcement could be made as early as next week.

Source: AAP 11 Feb 2017 - 4:20 PM  UPDATED 4 HOURS AGO Tweet Fake news is "killing people's minds" and a vast campaign is needed to combat the phenomenon, Apple boss Tim Cook says. The technology giant's chief executive says governments should wage information wars against phoney reports and businesses must create the tools to root out propaganda. False stories have thrived on social media in recent highly divisive political campaigns, in particular the US presidential election. In the UK, the parliament's culture, media and sprt committee is investigating the scourge over fears it could have a "significant impact" on democracy. Cook told UK Daily Telegraph that a "massive campaign" was needed with a "modern version" of a public service announcement. "We are going through this period of time right here where unfortunately some of the people that are winning are the people that spend their time trying to get the most clicks, not tell the most truth," he said. "It's killing people's minds in a way. "All of us technology companies need to create some tools that help diminish the volume of fake news." Fake news, which presents falsehoods as being truthful, is often housed on websites masquerading as media outlets. Notorious headlines have included "Pope Francis shocks world, endorses Donald Trump for president" and "Isis leader calls for American Muslim voters to support Hillary Clinton".

CEO Tim Cook Talks Up Augmented Reality's Potential (Again) The executive has been thinking (and talking) an awful lot about AR lately. Evan Niu, CFA (TMFNewCow) Feb 10, 2017 at 9:23PM Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has emerged as the next champion of augmented reality (AR). Despite the company's penchant for secrecy, it's become increasingly clear that Apple has something in the pipeline given that CEO Tim Cook keeps talking about AR's transformative potential. This is that whole "ship leaking from the top" bit that Steve Jobs always referred to. Every few months, Cook weighs in on the debate, either when asked on an earnings conference call or during a media interview. While Cook has never been a product visionary type, even by his own admission, his rationale for why AR has more potential than virtual reality (VR) makes an awful lot of sense, given Apple's never-ending pursuit of technologies that have mainstream appeal. Tim Cook holding the billionth iPhone. Image source: Apple. The most recent interview is with The Independent, which was published earlier today. Among other topics, Cook discussed why AR is the way to go. "AR allows individuals to be present in the world" Perhaps the most off-putting aspect of VR for the average consumer is the fact that users must don a headset to fully immerse themselves into a virtual world. Even before discussing the technical requirements or costs associated with a VR headset, it's fundamentally isolating. In contrast, AR sits on top of the real world as an overlay without the isolation. I'm excited about Augmented Reality because unlike Virtual Reality which closes the world out, AR allows individuals to be present in the world but hopefully allows an improvement on what's happening presently. Most people don't want to lock themselves out from the world for a long period of time and today you can't do that because you get sick from it. With AR you can, not be engrossed in something, but have it be a part of your world, of your conversation. That has resonance. Cook continued that he sees the opportunity in AR as analogous to the smartphone, believing that it can be for "everyone." AR still isn't there quite yet, and needs to improve until its "good enough for the mainstream," according to the chief executive. How and when? Cook's comments are but the latest in the ongoing debate over AR's future. In 2016, Cook discussed AR three consecutive months in a row: The Washington Post in August, ABC News in September, and BuzzFeed News in October. It's obviously been on his mind quite a bit. At this point, the two most important questions are how Apple will implement it -- a separate AR headset or integrated into the iPhone camera system, or both -- and when Apple will officially release its AR offering. If Apple goes the route of first integrating AR into the iPhone, which would largely be software-based, it could reduce the likelihood of leaks. In contrast, if Apple wants to jump straight to an AR headset, its supply chain will inevitably leak as prototypes are manufactured and there will be more physical evidence of its aspirations. Hopefully sooner rather than later, Apple will unveil its next "big idea." Evan Niu, CFA owns shares of Apple. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Apple.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Archive Apple Valley: Project Jupiter moves forward amid lodged environmental concerns Friday Feb 10, 2017 at 8:59 PM Feb 10, 2017 at 9:59 PM Matthew Cabe Staff Writer @DP_MatthewCabe APPLE VALLEY — The Town Council has approved a resolution that, in part, clears the way for the next step toward construction of a distribution center dubbed Project Jupiter. The Council’s unanimous vote Tuesday allows for submittal of a building plan for the 1.3-million-square-foot distribution center to be occupied by discount retailer Big Lots. The resolution adopted a Mitigated Negative Declaration for the project, approved a Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting program and denied an appeal that alleged Jupiter requires its own Environmental Impact Report. Lodged by Lozeau Drury LLP, the appeal related to the California Environmental Quality Act review of the project, which included a certified EIR for the North Apple Valley Industrial Specific Plan and the MND prepared specifically for the project. Before the Council’s vote, Lozeau Drury Associate Attorney Meredith Wilensky explained the need for a new report. “The Jupiter project is a new project that fits within the (North Apple Valley) Specific Plan,” she said. “We’re not arguing that it contradicts the specific plan, but that it is a new project with site-specific information that was not available at the time the specific plan was put forth (in October 2006).” Wilensky said a standard within CEQA that states when a new project “tiers off” an EIR, a new report must be conducted if there’s a fair argument for significant impacts; analysis, she said, revealed air-quality impacts related to Jupiter. “Based on that alone, an EIR is required,” Wilensky said. In addition, the appeal filed on behalf of the Laborers International Union of North America, Local Union No. 783 contended the project may have a significant effect on traffic and biological resources. But Deborah Quick, of Morgan Lewis, countered Wilensky’s claims, stating all requirements within the NAVISP EIR were imposed. Quick said the town performed a significant amount of work in order to designate the NAVISP. She added the town “envisioned a range of uses laid out across” that area. “The town’s intent was to approve those range of uses and recognize that as specific projects came in ... it would be appropriate to do further site-specific environmental review,” Quick said. “But the intent of the EIR was to ... take the … different types of uses and analyze what would be the outside envelope of expected environmental impacts across all the different resource areas that CEQA mandates.” Quick said the MND was appropriate — as opposed to a new EIR — as it relates to “that previously identified envelope” within the town’s intent. “What we have here is a use that ... was anticipated and is entirely compliant with the specific plan,” Quick said. Concerns were also raised over what might lie in the project's purview, including leftover explosive materials from when areas of Apple Valley served as a World War II bombing range and the federally protected burrowing owl. A representative for the Golden State Environmental Justice Alliance said a need exists for a wider range of soil samples, as well. Town officials have withheld the name of the distribution center's future occupant both in documents and in public, but Quick acknowledged outright that Big Lots looked forward to being a part of Apple Valley. Before the vote, Mayor Pro Tem Art Bishop said staff and the applicant “have been working for a long time” to ensure Apple Valley was the right community for the distribution center. “We in Apple Valley are prepared both economically (and) environmentally … not only for today but for tomorrow," Bishop said. "Not only for the safety of the employees that will be working and building that facility, but for the employees that will work there for — I pray — a long, long time.” The facility is expected to employ between 400 and 500. Construction will bring another 300 workers. The town expects to earn $2.8 million in development impact fee payments and an estimated annual property tax revenue of more than $600,000.

Ministry of electronics and IT secretary Aruna Sundarajan on Friday said a decision on incentives to Apple can be taken only after tax rates under GST are finalised. “GST is still evolving. See, what they (Apple) are asking for is, make it profitable for us to manufacture here and therefore give us a favourable duty regime. Exactly how favourable it should be is something that needs to be ironed out. But the first thing is what will be the manner in which this would be reflected in the new GST regime, (firmed up by) the GST Council,” Sundarajan said.

CNET SETTINGS OFF HD HQ SD LO Sundarajan added: “So only once the council decides how the existing trade regime is going to get translated into the new one and how domestic manufacturing incentives are going to get reflected in GST can a decision on Apple’s demands can be taken.” Most existing indirect taxes including excise duty, state value-added tax, service tax and countervailing duties on imports will be subsumed in GST. © image Most tax exemptions are set to be abolished in the GST regime. On Apple’s demands regarding making refurbished iPhones in India, the secretary said: “As long as they are exporting (it could be allowed)… They have asked for exports.” As part of its preconditions to manufacture in India, Apple had earlier told the government it wants to use its manufacturing unit here (when it has one) to also export “certified pre-owned iPhones”, apart from making new devices. The environment ministry is considering the proposal. The iPhone maker plans to set up only a “pilot project” near Bengaluru initially, and the extent of manufacturing there hinges on the kind of concessions the central government is willing to offer the tech giant. Apple, which has expressed interest in setting up manufacturing facilities in India, has reportedly sought several sops from the government, including a 15-year customs duty holiday on imports of iPhone kits, new and used capital equipment, and consumables. The California-based tech giant also wants duty cuts on components — completely knocked down (CKD) and semi-knocked down (SKD) units of iPhones — for re-assembly at the finished goods manufacturing line. It has also demanded a relaxation of the 30% local sourcing requirement under the foreign direct investment (FDI) rules. So far, Apple has not committed anything on investment or prospects of manufacturing and job creation to the central government. India, one of the fastest growing smartphone markets in the world, has emerged as a key revenue churner for Apple. According to the latest data from Counterpoint Research, Apple achieved a landmark, crossing 2.5 million smartphones in a calendar year, with a one-third of its total shipment coming from the record fourth quarter in 2016 alone, driven by seasonality and the launch of the iPhone 7. The company captured the 10th position in the Indian smartphone rankings during the fourth quarter of 2016 but led the premium segment (above $450) with a 62% market share.

He's made no secret he thinks it will trounce virtual reality, even going so far as to say AR use will eventually be as common as "eating three meals a day". Today, we've gotten more from the Apple boss on what he thinks of AR, and while we're still waiting on a concrete device that projects digital images onto the real world from the iPhone maker, it seems like it's only a matter of time now. Cook chatted with The Independent during his visit to the UK this week, and in the interview Cook said he prefers AR over VR because it "allows individuals to be present in the world but hopefully allows an improvement on what's happening presently."  "Most people don't want to lock themselves out from the world for a long period of time and today you can't do that because you get sick from it," Cook said of VR. "With AR you can, not be engrossed in something, but have it be a part of your world, of your conversation. That has resonance." Notably, Cook compared AR to probably the biggest consumer electronic device on the planet:  "I regard it as a big idea like the smartphone," he said. "The smartphone is for everyone, we don't have to think the iPhone is about a certain demographic, or country or vertical market: it's for everyone. I think AR is that big, it's huge." "I get excited because of the things that could be done that could improve a lot of lives. And be entertaining," Cook continued. "I view AR like I view the silicon here in my iPhone, it's not a product per se, it's a core technology." Clues to Apple's AR future Again, Cook has talked about his excitement for AR before, so there's no new revelation there. But dig a little deeper, and we get a few hints about how Apple might approach the tech, if ever.  Cook sounds keen to have AR be both useful and enjoyable, perhaps with applications for education, medicine and the workplace, along with leisure activities, like games. He would also appear to prefer something with see-through lenses, similar to Microsoft HoloLens, that lets users stay engaged with what's going on around them while also interacting with an AR overlay. Or, perhaps like 9to5Mac points out, Apple actually isn't working on a new device at all, but rather developing more AR features for the iPhone.  "I do think there can be a lot of things that really help people out in daily life, real-life things, that's why I get so excited out it," Cook told The Independent. What is more prevalent in our daily lives than our smartphones? Will Apple release AR tech simliar to Google's Tango? The iPhone 8 is rumored to have AR capabilities, including adding 3D effects to photos, and we can see Apple developing AR technology akin to Google's Tango for phones and tablets, or the Daydream mobile VR platform. Going this route would allow Apple to dive into AR without building, marketing and selling an entirely new product. What's more, Cook said he views AR as a core technology, similar to silicon in a handset, suggesting iPhone AR could be applied to other categories, such as tablets, computers and TV.  All this is certainly possible, though a recent report coming from VR/AR evangelist Robert Scoble, citing sources "at the highest levels," points to the tech giant teaming up with Carl Zeiss to develop augmented reality glasses, and a standalone VR/AR device has been rumored to be in development at Apple for some time. Cook, of course, could be talking about smart spectacles or other AR device as well. Whatever Apple is working on behind the scenes, it will likely be a while before we see it in an official capacity. Cook ended his interview with a caution there's still a ways to go before AR is "good enough for the mainstream," suggesting Apple, like it usually does, won't release a product until the tech has reached a certain level of maturity.  Via 9to5Mac The best iPhone deals this month Tags iPhone ABOUT THE AUTHOR Michelle Fitzsimmons Michelle is TechRadar's Senior News Editor, based in the Bay Area.

A litany of frustrated users have taken it to the Apple Support forums to cry out that their new iPhones have suffered chipping at various places despite using protective cases. While it appears the issue has affected only a small number of phones, complaints about worn-out paint continue to stack up. “This event was off the charts” Gary Vaynerchuk was so impressed with TNW Conference 2016 he paused mid-talk to applaud us. FIND OUT WHY Some concerned users claim they started noticing chipped edges after having used the Matte Black handset only for a few months, with 7 Plus models seemingly affected more often than the smaller sized iPhone 7. Here are few of the complaints: I am in the UK and got my phone (Matte Black 7 plus) on 1st Nov. I found first paint chip on the top left of the phone on 25th Nov… just had it less than a month. Another user claims the paint began to fall off on the edges despite his continuous efforts to protect the phone: I have been using iPhone 7 Plus Matte Black for about one month with fully covered by a TPU casing and full screen tempered glass most of the time. I just open the casing once a week to wipe the dust off from the phone… [but it] seems that the black anodised paint had been chipped off from the phone body. Some of customers with chipped off paint remark Apple has so far been unresponsive to their complaints since “cosmetic damages” are currently not covered under warranty. Others merely say they’ve resorted to DIY fixes, using basic acrylic paint from local craft shops to cover up the chipped spots. While wear and tear is certainly nothing out of the ordinary, the high number of complaints is somewhat concerning – especially when taking into account the Cupertino giant’s past woes with scratching and chipping. It remains unclear how widespread the issue is, but we have contacted Apple for further comment and will update the piece accordingly once we hear back.

Opinion | 06 Feb 2017 | Listen  | Print  | Comment (38) What Apple Can Learn from Airwalk by Josh Centers When I was a teenager in the 1990s, Airwalk shoes were all the rage. They were a mandatory accessory for grunge-oriented youths, along with plaid shirts and corduroy pants. The company was founded in 1986, and in its heyday in the 1990s, it had grown to be the third-largest sneaker brand, behind only Nike and Adidas. Today’s teens have undoubtedly never even heard of Airwalk sneakers, which are now found on the bargain rack at Payless Shoesource. What happened? Wait, this is TidBITS, not a fashion magazine, so why am I talking about shoes? Keep reading. I’m about to tell you a story that may sound chillingly familiar. Airwalk began as a niche shoe for professional skateboarders. Skating legend Tony Hawk (who starred in an eponymous video game that ran on the Mac, along with many other platforms) was one of their first customers, and actually suggested the name. Much of Airwalk’s early popularity was due to getting input from skaters to create superior skateboarding shoes that wouldn’t cause blisters or crashes. Airwalk had a healthy business, but it didn’t hit the big time until it hired advertising firm Lambesis to run an ultra-chic, counter-cultural ad campaign. As Malcolm Gladwell wrote in “The Tipping Point,” Airwalk was a $16 million company in 1993. In 1994, it was a $44 million company. In 1995, it was a $150 million company. To satisfy the vast influx of teenage customers while keeping skateboarders and boutique shops happy, Airwalk developed a two-tier strategy. It sold cheaper, consumer-grade shoes to mainstream retailers like Footlocker while continuing to provide pricier, professional-grade shoes to boutique shops. But Airwalk’s success didn’t last. The company’s troubles began in 1997 as production problems led to limited back-to-school supplies. Meanwhile, its lineup had become stale, with few new models. Worst of all, Airwalk abandoned its professional line of shoes. Serious skaters dropped Airwalk, causing the brand to lose its cachet with teens, and it wasn’t long before Airwalk’s time in the sun was over. A smallish company exploding due to quality products and a hip ad campaign. A product line that split into both consumer and professional tiers to provide different price points and features. A company that was later plagued by production problems, stagnant product designs, and ignoring its professional market. Does that sound like another company you can think of? Airwalk might have skated along for a while with its old designs and made peace with retailers, but abandoning its key market of hardcore skaters was what drove it into market irrelevance. In terms of managing supply chains and industrial design, Apple has a pair of superstars in Tim Cook and Jony Ive (to the extent Ive is still involved in product design, anyway). And Apple no longer worries about disappointing retailers, having opened hundreds of its own stores. More concerning is how Apple is treating its professional users. Let’s itemize a few of the ways Apple has moved away from the professional market over the past five years: Killing the Xserve Dumbing down Final Cut Pro with Final Cut Pro X Replacing the pro app Aperture with the consumer-level Photos Increasing burdensome restrictions on Mac App Store apps Releasing a new Mac Pro without internal expandability Failing to update that Mac Pro for over 3 years Delaying updates to the MacBook Pro line for nearly 18 months Releasing a new MacBook Pro that has drawn criticism from professionals Showing a lack of support for automation by eliminating the position of Product Manager of Automation Technologies We’re not alone in saying that Apple is now the iPhone company (see “Understanding Apple’s Marginalization of the Mac,” 21 November 2016). That’s where most of its profit comes from, and so that’s where most of its resources go. Fair enough. But, here’s the thing: the Mac and the capabilities it provides to professionals are the foundation of that iPhone business. Die-hard Mac users kept Apple afloat in the dark years before the iPod and then iPhone. And even now, regardless of all other professional uses of the Mac, developers need Xcode on the Mac to create iOS apps. Apple still has many things in its favor: $241 billion in cash, massive profits every quarter, one of the most popular brands in the world, and nearly 500 successful retail stores. And it might seem odd to criticize Apple now, especially when the company just broke a quarterly record with the most iPhone and Mac sales ever (helped by new iPhone and MacBook Pro models, plus the holiday shopping season, see “Apple Sees Apparent Return to Growth with Q1 2017’s Record Results,” 31 January 2017). But as we saw with Airwalk, things could go downhill fast if professional users were to leave the platform, taking with them all the people and organizations they currently keep loyal to Apple products. I don’t want to be too hard on Apple. The company is still incredibly strong and is doing better in some areas where it has been weak. By many accounts, Final Cut Pro X has improved greatly since its initial release, and some professional movie makers are giving it a chance. App Store review times are plummeting, and Apple is planning to allow developers to respond directly to App Store reviews. Swift is an exciting new programming language with a bright future, and it’s suitable for both compiled apps and scripts. You might argue that Apple and Airwalk aren’t comparable. For instance, although it may have gotten its start providing athletic shoes, Airwalk ultimately became a fashion company. But isn’t Apple similar in many respects? Apple opened its doors with the Apple I hobby kit, and by the mid-2000s, the iPod and its white earbuds were fashion mainstays. The Apple Watch is clearly intended to be a fashion item today. Even the MacBook, with its prominent usage in coffee shops, airports, and other public places, makes its own fashion statement. Despite these similarities, Apple is a much, much larger company than Airwalk ever was. Plus, Apple is making so much money and has so much cash that it can afford many more missteps than a plucky young footwear company. Perhaps most important, Apple can learn from the example of companies like Airwalk that fell from grace after losing sight of their most influential users. Here’s hoping Apple realizes the danger of diverting too much attention away from the Mac and its professional users.   Fujitsu ScanSnap Scanners — Save your business time and money with our easy-to-use small ScanSnap Scanner line.

Receive comments via RSS Add a comment Peter Meyer  2017-02-06 10:37 Josh, I was thinking about this over the weekend, but came to a different conclusion. Relying on fashion is not the winning strategy for a company that is this large. Nor is relying on what used to sell - gizmos. I am an Apple computer/phone/watch/TV user. I'll probably buy AirPods. But as a stock holder, I don't want Apple to stay there. I want Apple to move into healthcare and financial services and be willing to abandon computer power users along the way. Shoes are a great analogy, they move to a diminishing market. I want Apple to thrive, and I think it is time to move out of the diminishing phone and computers business and into services. If I could delegate Apple resources, I'd put some of the best folks they have on healthcare and finance. What does that make the phone and Mac? Loss leaders in 2020. Important to have but not the future of the company. So I guess that I am hoping Apple does the reverse of your last paragraph. Thanks for letting me think aloud, Peter Reply Josh Centers   2017-02-06 13:46 There's a lot to be said for Apple and services, but it's a matter of convincing the right people to write up their thoughts for us. :-) I think Apple is making some smart moves in the healthcare and IT spaces, especially with its IBM partnership. But as someone who uses Apple computers professionally, I don't want to see Apple become like IBM, moving entirely out of the end-user market to focus on back-end stuff. The iPhone is still by far Apple's largest revenue source, and the Mac users who create things for it are the backbone of that market. Reply David   2017-02-06 10:38 The day that a teen puts a poster of Marco Arment on the wall of their bedroom is the day that I will believe that the professionals you're talking about with regards to Apple are comparable to Tony Hawk. Reply Josh Centers   2017-02-06 13:46 Ha! Teens may not idolize developers, but they certainly enjoy the apps they produce, including maybe some of Marco's. You could argue that Snapchat today is what skateboarding was 20+ years ago, though that's sort of a lousy analogy. Another way to think about this is: imagine walking into a coffee shop and instead of MacBooks, everyone was working on Surface Pro tablets. Given enough scale, that'd certainly have a network effect. Something Gladwell describes in his book, which I didn't go into in the article, is how trends develop. You first have what he calls innovators, oddballs who do new things. Then you have other groups who translate those things for the masses, like mavens and connectors. My point is, to put it in Gladwell speak, if those innovators drop Apple for another platform, over time that could trickle down to the masses and quickly eat away Apple's bottom line. Reply David   2017-02-06 17:54 They may enjoy the apps, but I doubt that 1 in 100 of them know the name of the developer who wrote it. And that breaks the link between "I have to wear what Tony Hawk is wearing" and "I have to code on what Marco Arment is coding on." I can equally imagine -- in the coffee shop analogy -- the teens being horrified that the "old people" are using the same thing they are, and fleeing Apple en masse. Finally, I don't find Gladwell's arguments particularly convincing. He seems to me to regularly take a small part of a social science finding (10,000 hours of practice, eg) and blow it up into a much larger and simpler conclusion, one that makes a good pop-sci headline but doesn't really tells us much about the real world. The narrative at the moment seems to be that Apple is neglecting pros and that's going to cost them, but what I've mostly seen is a range of strained arguments about why it's going to cost them, ranging from possibly plausible to pretty outlandish. Reply Josh Centers   2017-02-07 10:34 I agree about Gladwell, which is why I didn't go too much into his theories in the article. However, outside of the linked interview, his book was the best source for the Airwalk story. The problem with arguments in favor of the professional markets is that there are a lot of intangibles there. In the case of Airwalk, it likely made total sense to dump the pro skater market for consumers — I'm sure they made far, far more money from Foot Locker than local skate shops. However, that turned out to be an enormous mistake, one that wouldn't appear on any spreadsheet. Reply David   2017-02-07 10:44 I think I'd like to see more than an anecdote before I buy into a narrative that is highly convenient for the people telling and reading it. Reply B. Jefferson Le Blanc  2017-02-07 22:44 One might say the same thing about your arguments. There's a whole truckload of wishful thinking there. Just from a local perspective, the predominant healthcare provider in my area, Palo Alto Medical Foundation, has excellent computerized records and services. They work on Windows PCs, not Macs. Other medical professionals use tablets, though they're not iPads, because they have to link with their non-Apple computer systems. Which is to say, without a Mac backbone, medical providers are not going to be using Apple products and services. Sure there are some highly visible Macs on some popular medical TV shows, but again, those are the Macs you so blithely dismiss. Great product placement, by the way. As Josh says, Macs are at the core of Apple's business. Without the Mac, the iPhone is just another gadget, here today, gone tomorrow. You know, like the iPad. And without the Mac, there will be no Apple products in medicine. As for financial whatever, all Apple does now is provide an access point via Apple Pay for consumers to the real financial service providers. They don't actually provide any of those financial services, nor are they likely to do so. Though they make a tidy profit with every Apple Pay transaction. You want to buy a Mac on credit through Apple you'll be using a Barclaycard, one of the highest interest rate charge cards on the planet, to whom Apple is only an intermediate business. In other words, I don't think your ambitions for Apple growth are grounded in anything like reality. As for shoes being a diminishing market, what planet are you living on? As large third-world countries like China, Mexico and India grow more prosperous, shoes will continue to be a growth industry. Just like iPhones. Which is why Apple is working so hard to break into the Indian market with lower price, recycled iPhones. That's where the growth is for them—and for Nike. The iPhone is the primary driver for the App Store, Apple's most prosperous service niche. And the App Store sells apps. And apps for the App Store are developed on Macs. Without the Mac there would be no apps and no App Store and, for all practical purposes, no iPhone. And no Apple. While Microsoft's Surface PCs are not yet a dominant product, Microsoft is clearly thinking long term, hence their huge investment in product placement in the NFL. The Surface Studio is coming out this year and will eventually, I presume to predict, make a significant dent in Apple's base among design professionals. Unless, as Josh hopes, Apple begins to take their professional base seriously once again. If I were twenty years younger I would certainly take the Surface Pro seriously. I share Josh's hope, but I don't share his optimism. If the new MacBook Pro is Apple's idea of a professional computer, with only 16GB of RAM, they've lost their way big time. They've taken their obsession with thin well past the point of diminishing returns. In the meantime, Tim Cook is good at blowing smoke at financial analysts, but as has been pointed out elsewhere in this issue of TidBITS, Apple's record first quarter was a week longer than the same quarter last year. In other words, Cook is using accounting gimmicks to draw a false equivalency between the two. Adjusted for that extra week, Apple's sales and profits are far less rosy than Cook would have us believe. At best they are flat, year over year. Is Apple making lots of money right now? Sure. Even with no growth they're still a rich company with money to burn. But they don't appear to be burning any of it on serious R&D. Like, perhaps, a touch interface for the macOS that can compete with Microsoft. iOS does touch just fine. But Cook refuses to acknowledge the need for it in OS X. Apple is riding high right now. But there's an old expression, what goes up must come down. Put another way, in business if you're not growing, you're dying. Implicit in Josh's argument is the proposition that Apple may have reached the peak of it's growth and success. They won't fail overnight, but that doesn't mean they're not failing. If Tim Cook is not aware of that, as he seems not to be, then Apple will be going downhill from now on. There may be a blip of success here and there, but that won't halt the downward momentum. Tim Cook is a nice guy and Steve Jobs was a jerk. Still, some might say the biggest difference between them is the vision thing. Steve had it. Tim does not. But I think the biggest difference between them is that Steve Jobs would not tolerate mediocrity. Time Cook seems to tolerate it all to well. Thanks David for giving me a jumping off point for my rant. I would have made it anyway, but you gave me a convenient place to start. I agree with Josh's premise, but I'm more skeptical than he is. Josh is politely suggesting that Apple needs to return it's attention to the Mac and the wide range of professional users who depend on it. Unlike Josh, however, I feel no need to be polite. Tim Cook needs to wake the f*ck up. Reply David   2017-02-07 22:37 You're certainly welcome. None of what you said was in response to my actual points, enough that I was wondering if there was another David in the thread. Apparently not. If you'd like to engage with my actual arguments, you're welcome to do that, too. Reply Nicholas Croft  2017-02-09 20:19 The PC 'enthusiast' market (broad term, basically power users of yore) is the only growth/margin market in the PC business. Apple are leaving money on the table by not addressing the enthusiast. Reply Zac Imboden   2017-02-06 15:06 What a thoughtful and well-written analysis. Regarding Peter Meyer's comments, I understand that Apple has it's own unique needs. What I would add is that what may be good for Apple (i.e. corporate expansion, diversification) may not be good for end users, specifically Mac users. I wish Apple to succeed as a company only as far as it concerns how they can continue to meet my needs and not theirs, my needs, not as a content revenue stream, an iPhone user, an iPad user, but as a MAC user. It appears to me that there is no longer any strong financial incentive for Apple to support and innovate their computer hardware and software as that segment continues to shrink in comparison to phone and content revenue. Continuing to complain about ridiculous mistakes in design and implementation and continuing to beg Apple to innovate and improve in the areas which matter the most to Mac users are losing propositions in the long run. If Apple wanted to do a great service to its various "niches", in my un-expert opinion, it would spin off the Mac and its system software and core apps into a separate company and let that company focus and innovate to meet the needs of its "niche" of Mac computer users at its own pace and peril. I'm not a investment guru, so I leave the financial merits of spin-offs for others. From an end-user endpoint, it seems to be the only way to get someone to pay closer attention to the very specific needs of computer users. Reply Travis Butler  2017-02-06 18:39 I think that would be courting the death of the Mac, honestly. As I argued in my other comment, the halo effect runs the other way - more people are buying Macs because they have used and liked Apple's consumer products. I think the main reason Macs have been bucking the overall decline in the computer industry is because they have Apple's strength in the consumer market to support them. If you cut the link there, you cut the main driving force for Mac market growth. Reply Josh Centers   2017-02-07 10:19 Thanks for the kind words, Zac. However, I disagree with Apple spinning off the Mac. Tight integration with other Apple devices is still one of the Mac's strengths, and a spin-off would threaten that. Reply Josh Centers   2017-02-07 10:20 I agree that the popularity of the iPhone and other Apple products helps drive Mac adoption. No argument there, and I think that's also still an important market for Apple. Reply B. Jefferson Le Blanc  2017-02-07 22:49 If Apple could value the Mac well enough to spin it off, they could value it enough to develop it internally. The problem is Apple doesn't seem to care one way or the other. Reply Derek Roff   2017-02-06 18:17 While Peter's suggestion that Apple get out of the hardware business strikes fear into my heart, I think it also misses Josh's key message. Why should a prudent investor like Peter assume that Apple can compete effectively in Services? This is an area where Apple has no particular expertise, and no intrinsic advantages. There are dozens of companies who understand Services better than Apple, and have both a deeper background and more agility. Airwalk survived as a fashion company, barely, and Apple might survive as an also-ran Services company, but as Josh indicates, this looks like the path to obscurity. Apple is a significant force in Services at the moment, because they are rich from hardware sales, and incredibly well known, from their integrated hardware, software, and lifestyle sales. Tossing all that out is, as Josh says, a losing strategy. Apple will not make its investors richer by proclaiming, "Think Conventionally". Reply Travis Butler  2017-02-06 18:30 Sigh. Another day, another 'Apple is doomed because they aren't catering to Important Users Like Me' article. The glaring flaw in this example is that it argues that people are drawn to Apple's consumer products because of the popularity of their computers among the elite - the halo effect. But if anything, the halo effect has run in the opposite direction, and has since the heyday of the iPod. People are buying Apple's consumer products, like the experience, and buying Macs to go with them. I've argued this before: Apple has, from the very first Apple ][, *always* catered to the ordinary user above the elite. When 'personal' computers were bulky S100 boxes that needed a separate dumb terminal and the arcane C/PM OS, Apple released a cute, streamlined all-in-one that hooked to a TV and booted into BASIC. When IBM introduced the designed-for-cubicles PC, Apple introduced the novice-user-friendly Mac. When smartphones were geeky tools, Apple released the iPhone. That's who they are. Reply Adam Engst   2017-02-06 18:44 So you're saying that none of your less-technical family, friends, or clients buy Apple hardware because of your recommendations? In my experience, most people who know they don't have the technical chops to make an informed decision buy based on social influence. Reply David   2017-02-06 21:27 Are his family & friends a sufficient sample to generalize? Reply Travis Butler  2017-02-07 04:51 Actually, seriously, yes. I've been asked for advice on *which* Mac to buy, but everyone I know who bought Mac in the last year decided to go that route on their own. Reply Adam Engst   2017-02-07 10:11 This is a discussion, not a research study. :-) Reply Adam Engst   2017-02-07 10:10 I obviously don't know the specifics, but unless you're well known for being platform agnostic, I doubt people would ask you for advice on other platforms. Your social influence to recommend Apple products is likely well known. Lots of people ask me for my opinions about what to buy, but they're always aware that I know Apple technology. But the article's point is that if you'd said, "Apple's hardware is stagnating and you'd be throwing money away if you didn't look at an Android phone or Windows PC" would those people ignore you and still buy Apple gear? In other words, if you as a tech influencer switched away from Apple gear, how many people would go with you eventually, purely because of your influence? Reply Josh Centers   2017-02-07 10:22 I'm not arguing that Apple is doomed. I can't count how many times I've written here something to the effect of "Apple is far from doomed." However, I do think shirking the professional market is an enormous mistake. Nor would I want Apple to drop or lose focus of its massively successful consumer line. The professional and consumer sides of Apple help build its strong ecosystem. Reply David   2017-02-07 10:50 2 people would go with me. Which would reduce Apple customers for the last quarter from 96 million people to 95,999,998. Even if there were 50,000 tech influencers who took 2 people with them, it would reduce Apple's customers from 96 million to 95,900,000 last quarter. (all numbers either approximate (customer numbers, people I influence) or made up (number of tech influencers)). Math done badly and on the fly. Reply B. Jefferson Le Blanc  2017-02-07 23:26 I'm not arguing that Apple is doomed, either, though I'm more cynical on the subject that Josh is. For one thing, doomed is a vague and melodramatic term. If Apple fails to innovate and improve the Mac, then their base of support will be eroded over time because, as I said before, the Mac is the core of Apple's business. Without it Apple's other business interests would fail to flourish. And that's putting it mildly. In my opinion, without the Mac there is no Apple. But I don't see Apple killing the Mac. After all, it's still making money. What I see happening, as Josh points out in more polite terms, is that the Mac appears to be declining in importance for Apple. This doesn't spell doom, but it does spell stagnation. Meanwhile, Apple competitors continue to innovate. As an artist, the Surface Studio is the first Windows PC that has ever piqued my interest. If Apple continues to rest on it's laurels Microsoft is going to eat their lunch. Now that they are making good hardware, Microsoft is playing in the same ballpark with Apple. And, like macOS X 10.12.x, Windows 10 is a solid and accessible OS. And there are areas, like cloud services, where Microsoft far exceeds Apple's success. So do Google and Amazon. Services aren't going to save Apple's bacon. The Mac is the only thing that can do that, not because it makes the most money, but because it's central to the success of every other Apple venture. What I don't understand is why Tim Cook doesn't seem to know this. His desultory remarks about the future of the Mac are not encouraging. Another incremental update to the iMac or the Mac mini isn't going to get the job done. Nor are incremental improvements to the macOS. As I've said before, at the top of my wish list is a touch screen interface for the macOS. Without this it's very hard to see how Apple is going to keep up with the competition. Reply Christian Kaatmann   2017-02-06 19:21 The thing that Apple is certainly doing right now - seen from a user perspective - is that _all_ of their systems are much more reliable now than they used to be. I very rarely have to reboot, if one app crashes the rest of the system carries on unperturbed, I can go seamlessly from my Mac to my iPhone to iCloud on a windows machine without ever loosing a comma in the text I'm working on. It's like magic compared to not so many years ago. And Apple has got us all happily hooked on its services with iCloud at the centre. And I mean happily, thinking of the days back with Excel 1.04, swapping disks on my Mac SE or more recently trying to keep my iMac from crashing every time I switched from Mail to Word to Excel to ... Apple keeps a lot of customers happy and deeply dependent. Reply Peter Meyer  2017-02-06 19:31 That is a great point. Thank you! Reply Josh Centers   2017-02-07 10:23 Apple does enjoy tremendous lock-in, which certainly gives it staying power. iCloud is one of the weaker service bundles, but it's bolstered by the popularity of the hardware, which in turn benefits from iCloud lock-in. Not to mention dependence on iMessage. Reply Peter Meyer  2017-02-06 19:30 A quick addition if you don't mind. I am going to express my opinion, not fact. I don't think that Apple will abandon the larger Mac and phone and iPod markets (or TV or iPads.) I am looking at these devices as critically important. Not important as computing devices, but highly valuable as data devices. What is the difference? Computing takes place in a small fairly closed environment. Data is fed by and then feeds a larger system. (I think of the Mac Pro as being about computing, the iPad and Apple TV as being about data.) If I look at this as an investor, I see that data system as services with end point devices. The devices are either commodity products or are really sophisticated at handling data to and from the user. That data is the core of the future services. (Again, this is me as businessman, not as the guy who is really enjoying this MBP right now). Apple should, absolutely should, stay in the end point market and make exceptionally exciting devices like an iPhone so light that you need a lanyard to hold it in place. Those devices are data portals, and the real economic engine for what might be the most valuable company on the planet will be the data services. They actually might subsidize the hardware experiments that many of us love. For those hardware experiments, my credit card vibrates in anticipation. My business mind is looking for services in healthcare and automobiles. The hardware is what we know, the services that we do not yet know will be our future, just as the pocket computer once was. So much for me being quick. Josh, Adam, thank you! Reply Herb Bowie  2017-02-06 20:16 The analogy seems a bit contrived, and the conclusions a bit overblown. Part of what we have always loved and respected about Apple is its intent and ability to skate to where the puck is going to be, not to where it is. If we think about these issues from that perspective, we might make the following observations: 1. As device buses get increasingly powerful, and as the pace of technology change quickens, and as the desire for smaller computers increases, it will make sense for users to do "upgrades" by adding or swapping out peripherals, not through changes to the internals of their computers. 2. As SSD, memory, networks and microprocessors all get faster, the simple desire for ever bigger numbers -- faster chips, more RAM, etc. -- becomes less and less relevant for most users. 3. While Apple needs to provide core apps and services to make the average consumer happy, Apple's primary contribution to the larger app ecosystem is to make better tools for developers, not to make "Pro" level applications themselves. 4. As security becomes more and more of an issue, tight controls on the App store become increasingly important; however, third-party software suppliers still have the ability to deliver apps to their customers outside of the App store, so customers can have the best of both worlds. 5. As it becomes easier and easier to develop Mac applications, and as the Mac development tools grow stronger, and as the number of specialized apps continues to grow, it becomes ever harder to see why the Mac would need a special department for "Automation Technologies" for those few users who cannot find already developed solutions to their problems, yet who are also unable to develop new solutions themselves. So, yes, in all these cases, there are some short-term bumps in the road for many of us, and some more difficult issues for a few of us, but isn't this what we've always expected from Apple? Reply mike sanders  2017-02-06 21:53 Excellent response and a much more focussed overview, great respect to Josh but like so many "old" Apple users you still expect them to be a computer company which they no longer are. I have been a user since 1987 and an investor since the 2000s and have to say I am completely satisfied on both accounts. A very well run company which clearly knows where it is going just that it doesn't share it with us until the time is right. Have you seen the stock price today? Reply Josh Centers   2017-02-07 10:25 Per your point on automation — I think Apple sees Swift as eventually overtaking AppleScript. That's fine with me, but Apple also needs to continue to create automation tools for professionals who aren't programmers. Reply B. Jefferson Le Blanc  2017-02-07 23:47 I agree. Unfortunately, Apple has a habit of dropping the ball on good ideas and technologies. For example, iWeb was overtaken by the competition because Apple lost interest in developing it. The same goes for Aperture. Now Apple Script and Automator are threatened with extinction, with no accessible replacement in sight. Apple Script and Automator enable the user to plug right into the OS and their applications. They are essentially programmable apps. Swift, on the other hand, is a programming language not an application. It's hard to imagine a third party developing a program with Swift that will have the broad capabilities of Apple's native apps. If history is any guide, apprehension is called for. Reply Dennis B. Swaney  2017-02-07 00:35 You forgot bonehead moves like killing Apple Displays, AirPort, and now it looks like the iPad lines will be next. Possibly even the desktop Macs. Tim Cook needs to be canned. Reply Josh Centers   2017-02-07 10:26 Indeed, I should have mentioned the loss of Apple displays and the apparent abandonment of AirPort routers. The latter is a thorn in my side at the moment, since my Express is on its last legs, and I'm distrustful of others on the market. Reply B. Jefferson Le Blanc  2017-02-08 01:06 Right you are. Both Apple Displays and Airport routers have been overtaken by the competition because Apple has apparently lost interest in supporting and improving them. This has the look of a tradition at Apple. Or a disability, like ADD. There was a time when third-party routers did not support the Mac with decent setup software. Airport routers solved that problem, though they tended to be less capable than the competition. They had the virtue of being simple. That time is past. Though various routers handle the matter differently, their setup software has improved. For instance, I can get into a Comcast router's built-in setup software with a simple URL, as I did with Linksys routers in the past. AT&T has always bumped me to a web site where I entered the appropriate information and the web site passed it to the router. This was particularly useful in the old days when routers and modem settings often got corrupted. If something went wrong, pop, there I was at the AT&T setup page. Nowadays routers are more reliable and such problems are rare—though not unheard of. Apple eventually improved the simple Airport Base Station by including a hard drive that interfaced easily with Time Machine—the Airport Time Capsule, an appropriate name at the time. And the Time Capsule has improved over the years with a space saving tower configuration and larger hard drives. Though you can still get the Airport Extreme which is a simple router without the hard drive. It's comparably priced with similar routers, except that you still need an external modem, which might be a disadvantage, unless you're used to setting up modems. That said, I don't know why Apple is apparently dropping their WiFi product line. They work perfectly well. Perhaps sales have declined as service providers now so often provide their own routers and independent modems are less common. Airport routers still require an external modem, which puts them behind the curve. I used to like a separate modem because they tended to fail more often that routers. But now I rent my router from Comcast and if it fails for any reason I just pop down to the Xfinity store and get a replacement. The same goes for AT&T. I haven't had occasion to set up an Airport router in years. Still, I don't think it's a good reason not to get a replacement Airport Express if your Airport Extreme orTime Capsule is still working OK. Current models have the fastest WiFi, 802.11ac, and they are still for sale on the Apple web site, as is the Airport Express. Replacing the Express seems to me to be simpler than regigering your entire system with a new router and a new repeater. But then if your router is also having issues, there are less expensive alternatives to the Airport, depending on your setup. Reply Jean-Pierre SMITH  2017-02-07 04:37 Great analogy and thinking, for the Mac platform. I liked the idea the combination of (1) techical brilliance, as seen by the recognised "experts" and (2) some hype (better call it "intelligent design") is a key factor of success for the Mac. Remove one of the two pillars and the structure collapses. To remember, I still have on my LC-475's screen saver (not used any more) the picture of a snail carrying on its back a rival PC's Intel CISC processor. These old macs used Motorola RISC processors, deemed faster by the "experts". You may have called to the bar Michelin, whose tyres for trucks (trucking fleets are the tyre equivalent to the Mac's "expert" users) are in demand for their durability (mileage), while car drivers don't measure mileage but simply benefit from it without knowing. Car tyres benefit directly from R&D invested in truck tyres just as the Mac for me [ordinary Joe] directly benefits from the Mac used, misused and challenged by its professional users (the "experts"). I am not so sure, though, the above analogy works for the iPhone, iPad and iWatch lines (is it still true that the iPhone for the Presidents is called "Blackberry"?). Thanks for the brain teaser. Reply Nicholas Croft  2017-02-09 20:13 The PC 'enthusiast' market is the only one with growth. Sell the OS for $500 - restricted to 6 core+ (ie X99) motherboards, only from (a few) vetted vendors. No manufacturing costs. Pure profit once initial outlay of programming is covered.

Apple adding wireless charging to the new fleet of phones will be expensive, but with rumors of the iPhone X costing over $1000 - wireless charging better be included - or else the expensive price begins to be scrutinized even more.   We should also expect an upgraded 3D Touch module that will add an "additional graphite sheet lamination" to the new iPhone, which will reportedly keep the new iPhone from overheating. Kuo said: "While we don't expect general users to notice any difference, lamination of an additional graphite sheet is needed for better thermal control and, thus, steady operation; this is because FPCB is replaced with film, which is more sensitive to temperature change of the 3D touch sensor in OLED iPhone".   I really doubt Apple would release what could be the Next Big Thing in smartphones with the iPhone X, and not have wireless charging - but the iPhone 8 with wireless charging? That's a good step, too.

But that article was a bit of a tease, since it left you hanging with a set-up system that you hadn’t used. In this installment, I’ll explain how you control your Accessories with Apple’s Home app, as well as Control Center, Siri, and even your Apple Watch. Controlling Accessories in the Home App -- To access an Accessory (which, you’ll remember, generally maps to a particular device), go to the Rooms screen, tap the hamburger button, and choose the Room that contains the Accessory. In the Room’s listing, you’ll see all the Accessories associated with that Room. For things like smart bulbs and smart plugs, you can tap the Accessory icon to turn it on or off. That’s simple to say, but it’s actually one of the key uses of the Home app, since it gives you remote control over any Accessory that turns on and off. (For some other devices, like room sensors, tapping their icons will have no effect because they’re always on.) To work with Accessories in additional ways, either press and hold or 3D Touch an Accessory icon. That brings up a screen that shows more details and controls. For example, a room sensor shows its current status, a smart plug has a simple on/off switch, and a smart bulb offers a brightness slider. If a smart bulb supports multiple colors, a Color button appears too; tapping it brings up buttons that let you choose a color for the light. Tapping Edit in the center of a button brings up a detailed color wheel. Choosing a color there replaces one of the circles in the main color selector with that color. The Color screen also has a Temperature tab, which is the same thing, but with various degrees of white light. Frustratingly, Apple’s Home app doesn’t let you copy your color selections between devices, so if you want to be sure that all your bulbs have the same color, you’ll need a third-party HomeKit app with finer control, like Matthias Hochgatterer’s Home app. But if you’re dealing with lights that should work together anyway, you can group them, which you do from the Details screen. It’s All in the Details -- When you tap and hold or 3D press a HomeKit Accessory, you can also access its Details screen, which presents a few Accessory options, like name and location. You might remember some of these options from initial Accessory setup, as I detailed in “A Prairie HomeKit Companion: Setting Up Accessories and Rooms.” I want to focus on two options in the Details screen. The first is the Include in Favorites switch. You should enable this for any Accessory you plan to use with any regularity because it adds a shortcut for that Accessory to the Home screen of the Home app, to Control Center, and to the Home app on the Apple Watch. Note that Control Center won’t display more than nine Accessories at a time, so it pays to be picky. The second is the Group with Other Accessories option, which combines your Accessories so that they act as one — their individual Accessory icons will be replaced by a single new icon. This is useful if you have multiple smart bulbs in a single light fixture or multiple lights in the same room that you want to be in sync. I use it to group our living room floor lamps to keep their brightness and color settings the same. To group Accessories, tap Group with Other Accessories. On the next screen, give your group a name and select the other Accessories to add to the group. Tap Done when you’re finished. The icons for those Accessories will be replaced by a single icon for the group. To ungroup Accessories, go to the Details screen for the group and tap Ungroup Accessories. Remember, if you plan to use the group frequently, don’t forget to set it as a favorite! If you want to adjust one Accessory in a group independently, go to the Details screen for the group and tap Accessories to reveal individual icons for the Accessories. From that screen, you can adjust each Accessory on its own. Setting Scenes -- Tinkering with Accessories constantly gets tiresome. Thankfully, HomeKit offers shortcuts, called Scenes, that combine actions together. For example, you could have a Scene called Good Morning that turns on all of your lights, a Scene called I’m Leaving that turns off your lights and turns down the thermostat, and a silly party Scene that turns your living room red. To create a Scene, tap the plus icon in the upper-right of the Home or Rooms screens and choose Add Scene. Home will suggest some Scene names, or you can create your own name by tapping Custom. Once your Scene is named, tap Add Accessories, and then tap individual Accessories to add them to the Scene. Tap Done to move on. Next, you’ll be taken to a screen with the Scene name, and the Accessories included in the Scene. Adjust the Accessories as you normally would. For instance, tap a smart bulb icon to turn it on in the Scene, or press and hold to adjust its brightness and color. Finally, at the bottom are options to Test This Scene, which activates it temporarily; Add Accessories, where you can modify the Accessories included in the Scene; and Show in Favorites, which I recommend enabling for essential Scenes. Suggested Scenes -- I recommend three Scenes to everyone: Good Morning, Good Night, and Scenes to quickly adjust the brightness in your primary living areas. For instance, I have three favorited living room Scenes for adjusting brightness: Living Room Bright, Living Room Dim, and Living Room Night, which set my living room Hue lights to 100 percent, 40 percent, and 0 percent (very dim, but not off), respectively. With these Scenes, I can easily dim the living room to watch a movie, but also quickly brighten it up if I need to find the remote or change my son’s diaper. Adjust these scenes as you see fit, but I recommend using my names, as they’re easy to identify and Siri has no trouble understanding them. When configuring the Good Morning and Good Night Scenes, the settings will depend on your Accessories and living situation. Think carefully about what to activate and why. My Good Morning Scene does three things. It turns on the smart plug that controls the lamp in the laundry and music rooms and sets the living room lamps to 40 percent brightness. During the Christmas season, it also turned on the plug that controlled the Christmas tree lights. My Good Night Scene does the opposite, though it dims the living room lamps to 0 percent instead of turning them completely off. These Scenes are set up in such a way to light up the house sufficiently to navigate in the morning, without being painfully bright. Even though we have Hue bulbs in our bedrooms, these Scenes don’t touch them at all. Why not? I set Good Morning to activate automatically during weekdays. If my wife and son get a surprise snow day, I don’t want them getting a rude awakening at 5:30 AM if I forget to turn the Automation off. I often want to control the bedroom lamp independently when I go to bed, either turning it on so I can find my way around or leaving it off if my wife is sleeping. I use Good Morning and Good Night as general-purpose Scenes throughout the day. I activate Good Night after my wife leaves for work and then Good Morning before she gets home. Nothing is happening in either bedroom, so there’s no reason to mess with those lights. All that said, I don’t recommend that you create Scenes right away. Instead, experiment with your Accessories and figure out which settings you like and which devices you use most. Setting up Scenes will be easier once you have a sense of what you’re doing regularly. But if you just want to create some goofy Scenes to turn your living room blue or whatever, go for it! That’s part of the fun of home automation. (If I ever install a HomeKit-equipped thermostat, I’ll probably create a Game of Thrones-inspired scene that turns my lights blue and drastically lowers the temperature. Because I’m a huge dork.) Once you’ve created a Scene, you can find it in two places in the Home app. If you set it as a favorite, it’ll be available from the Home app’s Home screen (and in Control Center). Otherwise, look in any Room with which the Scene is associated. If a Scene is split between multiple Rooms, you can find it in any of its Rooms. Control with Control Center, the Apple Watch, and Siri -- Jumping in and out of the Home app every time you want to turn on a light is more work than flicking a switch on the wall. Thankfully, Apple offers some quicker ways to activate your Accessories. I usually use Control Center on my iPhone to manipulate my HomeKit devices. In iOS 10, Apple redesigned Control Center with multiple pages, and if you have any HomeKit devices favorited, swipe to the left twice to reveal an additional Control Center page that lets you control both Accessories and Scenes. In the Home page of Control Center, a button in the upper right lets you switch between controlling favorite Accessories and Scenes. Tapping an Accessory or Scene turns it on or off. As with the Home app, you can press and hold or 3D Touch Accessories in Control Center to see more advanced settings like brightness and color. Control Center can display only nine Scenes and nine Accessories, so while you should favorite the items you use the most, you also want to be selective. If you own an Apple Watch, the Home app built into watchOS 3 also lets you control favorite Accessories and Scenes. I recommend adding it to your Dock for quick access. Tapping an Accessory or Scene activates it, while the … button lets you adjust things like brightness — which you do with the digital crown. That said, I don’t use the Apple Watch Home app often, as I find it unreliable. It frequently throws No Response error messages for all of my Accessories. Like many Apple Watch activities, I can perform the same task on my iPhone more quickly. Of course, you can also control HomeKit with Siri, which is a big win when it works. If everything is set up correctly, you can use a number of commands, such as: “Turn all my lights on.” “Turn off the bedroom lamp.” “Set the thermostat to 72 degrees.” “Make my living room blue.” “Good morning.” (Activates the Good Morning Scene) “Set Scene Good Morning.” (Does the same thing as above, which is useful if Siri doesn’t recognize the Scene name on its own.) For the most part, Siri controls work well, even with Hey Siri on the Apple Watch (though my watch usually takes longer to recognize the command). You can even use these same Siri commands with the fourth-generation Apple TV, assuming it’s running tvOS 10 or higher and it’s signed into the same iCloud account as your other HomeKit devices. That’s about all you need to know about controlling HomeKit devices for now. In the next installment of this series, I’ll explain how to set up a hub so you can operate your HomeKit devices when you’re out of the house and how to set up Automations to make your devices work on their own.

Can the mac be the boss (can Automator and Apple scripts command these internetted things ? Symetrically, can HomeKit automation be the boss and trigger automator actions or Applescripts on a sleeping mac ? Reply Josh Centers   2017-02-07 10:51 Sadly, no. There's no HomeKit support in macOS 10.12 Sierra. I'm hoping it's added at some point. Reply  Search   Cached.

 Apple CEO Tim Cook: 'We don’t support the immigration ban' Kif Leswing Feb. 8, 2017, 5:21 PM 2,123 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple Apple CEO Tim Cook gave the company's most full-throated condemnation of President Trump's recent immigration order while he was overseas, in Scotland. “We don’t support the immigration ban and we have been very public about it,” Cook said at a ceremony at the University of Glasgow, where he was receiving an honorary degree. "Our simple view is that Apple would not exist without immigration, so this is a huge issue for us. So what do we do? We voice our opinion and stand up - we don’t sit in silence," Cook said, according to the Scotsman, which was at the event. During a Q&A, Cook later said that he doesn't see Apple as an activist company. "I don't view Apple as an activist, and I don't view myself as an activist," he said. "The reason is that a lot of people hear that word and they think of a professional activist, and that's not what we are. What we do, for things that we have deep knowledge on, or think we do, or a strong point of view based on what we've learned, that gives us some standing to make a point, we're not shy. We'll stand up even when our voice shakes." Cook said that within 24 hours of Trump signing the order, he sent an email to all Apple employees addressing the order. Since then, Apple also signed its name to a Google-led amicus brief filed in court against the order. "I've heard from many of you who are deeply concerned about the executive order issued yesterday restricting immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries. I share your concerns. It is not a policy we support," Cook wrote in the memo.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Saturday, 11 February 2017 | MYT 8:00 AM Apple Watch takes half of the market and posts record figures in 2016 Massive seller: 11.9 million Apple Watches were sold around the world in 2016. — Apple There is no denying the records set by Apple in the fourth quarter of 2016. Not only did the Cupertino, California giant unload 78 million iPhones, it also succeeded in shipping six million connected watches during the same period, according to the latest figures from market research consultant Canalys.  The figure of six million Apple Watches shipped highlights a 12% increase for the same quarter in 2015. But more importantly it also shows that Apple has monopolised two thirds of the connected watch market, which boasted overall shipments of nine million units in the course of the period, reports Canalys.  Even more extraordinary, in terms of value Apple Watch accounted for 80% of revenue generated by the smartwatch market.  With regard to overall figures for 2016, Apple shipped 11.9 million watches, accounting for nearly half of the market share (49%). Not surprisingly then, Apple enjoys a huge lead in this market, where it is far ahead of second placed Fitbit (17%) and third placed Samsung (15%). Taken together, all of the other connected watch producers account for a market share of only 19%.  In 2017, however, Canalys is predicting a bounce in shipments of Android Wear watches, notably with the long awaited widespread deployment of Android Wear 2 and the launch of such models as the Samsung Gear S3 which will be available in "Classic" and "Frontier" versions. — AFP Relaxnews You May Be Interested ‘Pokémon Go’ celebrates Valentine’s Day Tesla pausing factory for Model 3 preparation this month Android Wear 2.0 launched with two new watches by LG UK plans to remove insurance barriers for self-driving cars Parents warned about friendship app for teens Experiencing painful menses?

Home Industry Now, Apple Inc’s iPhone plans in India hit GST hurdle Now, Apple Inc’s iPhone plans in India hit GST hurdle Ministry of electronics and IT secretary Aruna Sundarajan on Friday said a decision on incentives to Apple can be taken only after tax rates under GST are finalised. By: FE Bureau | New Delhi | Published: February 11, 2017 5:47 AM Ministry of electronics and IT secretary Aruna Sundarajan on Friday said a decision on incentives to Apple can be taken only after tax rates under GST are finalised. (Reuters) Until it is clear whether, and how, the domestic tax incentives will be accommodated in the forthcoming goods and services tax (GST) regime, the goverment won’t take a call on US tech giant Apple’s wish-list in the context of its plan to set up an iPhone/iPad manufacturing unit in India, reports fe Bureau in New Delhi. Ministry of electronics and IT secretary Aruna Sundarajan on Friday said a decision on incentives to Apple can be taken only after tax rates under GST are finalised. “GST is still evolving. See, what they (Apple) are asking for is, make it profitable for us to manufacture here and therefore give us a favourable duty regime. Exactly how favourable it should be is something that needs to be ironed out. But the first thing is what will be the manner in which this would be reflected in the new GST regime, (firmed up by) the GST Council,” Sundarajan said. Sundarajan added: “So only once the council decides how the existing trade regime is going to get translated into the new one and how domestic manufacturing incentives are going to get reflected in GST can a decision on Apple’s demands can be taken.” Also Watch: Most existing indirect taxes including excise duty, state value-added tax, service tax and countervailing duties on imports will be subsumed in GST. Most tax exemptions are set to be abolished in the GST regime. On Apple’s demands regarding making refurbished iPhones in India, the secretary said: “As long as they are exporting (it could be allowed)… They have asked for exports.” As part of its preconditions to manufacture in India, Apple had earlier told the government it wants to use its manufacturing unit here (when it has one) to also export “certified pre-owned iPhones”, apart from making new devices. The environment ministry is considering the proposal. The iPhone maker plans to set up only a “pilot project” near Bengaluru initially, and the extent of manufacturing there hinges on the kind of concessions the central government is willing to offer the tech giant. Apple, which has expressed interest in setting up manufacturing facilities in India, has reportedly sought several sops from the government, including a 15-year customs duty holiday on imports of iPhone kits, new and used capital equipment, and consumables. The California-based tech giant also wants duty cuts on components — completely knocked down (CKD) and semi-knocked down (SKD) units of iPhones — for re-assembly at the finished goods manufacturing line. It has also demanded a relaxation of the 30% local sourcing requirement under the foreign direct investment (FDI) rules. So far, Apple has not committed anything on investment or prospects of manufacturing and job creation to the central government. India, one of the fastest growing smartphone markets in the world, has emerged as a key revenue churner for Apple. According to the latest data from Counterpoint Research, Apple achieved a landmark, crossing 2.5 million smartphones in a calendar year, with a one-third of its total shipment coming from the record fourth quarter in 2016 alone, driven by seasonality and the launch of the iPhone 7. The company captured the 10th position in the Indian smartphone rankings during the fourth quarter of 2016 but led the premium segment (above $450) with a 62% market share.

Home Contact Advertise About RSS @PowerPage @JasonOGrady Rumor: Apple could start production of iPhone 8 earlier than expected Posted by: Chris Barylick Date: Tuesday, February 7th, 2017, 05:42 Category: Hardware, iPhone, Processors, Rumor Apple could start production of its next-gen iPhone earlier than expected. Per BlueFin Research Partners, there’s “some indication” from the supply chain that Apple will ramp up production of the iPhone 8 starting in June, but that doesn’t necessarily point towards an earlier non-September release date. The report offers the following quote: The most intriguing data points that we have uncovered suggests that AAPL is ramping the next generation iPhones earlier than historical norms, although we have no indication that there has been any change in release plans for the iPhone 8/X.[…] Interestingly, our present reads suggest a 300% increase in iPhone 8/X builds in the June quarter, now sitting at 9M. As a result, overall June quarter builds have increased from 45M to 48M, with the sharp increase in iPhone 8 offset somewhat by modest declines in legacy models. Given the radical design changes expected in the iPhone 8, it is unsurprising that the company may be planning to ramp up production earlier than normal, if the information BlueFin Research has shared is accurate. An earlier production date will give Apple time to improve yield rates and work out manufacturing issues, and could potentially lead to better supply when the iPhone 8 launches in September. The current rumors have it that the iPhone 8 will feature an edge-to-edge OLED display, possible curved angles for the display, as well as a glass backing that deviates from the aluminum body used since the iPhone 4s. It’s also thought that the handset will feature a Touch ID Home button built directly into the display. Other rumored features include some form of wireless charging,a faster, more efficient A11 processor, advanced biometrics like facial recognition or iris scanning, a new Taptic engine and 3D Touch advancements, and camera improvements. BlueFin Research also says Apple has adjusted iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, and iPhone SE production downward as it begins preparing for the launch of the iPhone 8. Stay tuned for additional details as they become available.

The oldest existing Apple dealership — anywhere — has operated on Stevens Street since exiting downtown in 1997. The move reflects both Apple's changing requirements and how computer retailing has changed in the past 20 years. "You're not going to find the big warehouse stores stacking boxes to the ceiling," General Manger Jeff Thomas said. "That's not how retail looks anymore." Instead, customers will find a more intimate setting that appeals to Apple, which helped find and approve the location next to Golf Etc. "It used to be that people bought a giant tower and giant monitor," Thomas said. "We needed a lot more space for inventory then." With the adoption of smartphones, tablets and notebooks, computer retailers don't need as much elbow space. "Even 17-inch notebooks are passe," he said. "Most people want smaller, lighter machines; 13 to 15 inches is the sweet spot. Wearable devices are huge sellers now. They cost as much as a PC, but they're tiny." While the retail space is slightly smaller, Thomas said, more room is dedicated to service technicians. The Spring Street lease doesn't run out until June, but it was better to grab the next place a bit early. "You can't time those things perfectly," Thomas said. Apple real estate specialists also checked out Northgate Marketplace before settling on the east Medford location.  The industry has seen continual miniaturization of components and devices, which may have made this move easier than the last one. Nonetheless, transplanting a business overnight remains a monumental task, said Marketing Manager Tom Pentland, who has been with the firm for more than three decades. "It was just as excruciating," Pentland said. "There's nothing fun about moving heavy displays, but at least the computers are a lot smaller. The old (cathode ray tube) monitors with 19- and 21-inch displays were a load.  We started packaging up some stuff the week leading up to the move. We had a skeleton crew at the old location on Saturday, while everyone else was helping with the move." The firm has 21 employees, adding seasonal help in the summer when regulars are on vacation, and Christmas. When the store opened in 1976, it was known as Team Electronics and sold stereo systems, speakers and CD players. Owner Rick Mandell signed on with the little-known Apple during a conference in 1979 when it was marketing the Apple.  In the 1980s, the retailer jettisoned the audio components, briefly rebranding itself as Microworks. "We got out of consumer electronics at exactly the right time," Pentland said. As the only Apple premium service partner between Redding, California, and Eugene, including the coast, Connecting Point's reach ranges beyond the Rogue Valley. Between 2000 and 2015, Connecting Point operated a Bend location. "Central Oregon is a different type of market where there are a lot of seasonal folks with second homes for winter or summer," Thomas said. "So a lot of the buying patterns are different." Sometime within the next two years, however, Thomas said, Connecting Point plans to extend its presence — perhaps returning to Central Oregon or going into Redding or Roseburg. "With our service area," he said, "we're reaching all the way down within 50 miles of Redding, and within 50 miles of Eugene already."  — Reach reporter Greg Stiles at 541-776-4463 or business@mailtribune.com.

By Leslie P. Norton Biography August 6, 2011 Murray Stahl, the chief investment officer of New York-based Horizon Kinetics, began his career as a utility analyst. In the early 1980s, Stahl, a value investor, recommended buying shares of out-of-favor General Public Utilities, then the owner of Three Mile Island, which in 1979 had been the site of the U.S.'s worst nuclear power accident. Investors who heeded his advice made big money. Thus began a career of independent thinking about the market and a wide-ranging interest in what makes successful people tick. He shares these views with his investors, and also with subscribers to Horizon publications such as The Spin-off Report and ETF Compendium. (For a taste, check the "Research Library" tab at www.horizonkinetics.com). Last week, Stahl talked with Barron's about exchange-traded funds, the importance of qualitative insights -- and of course, about stocks. Barron's: Why are exchange-traded funds so important to a stockpicker? Stahl: ETFs are affecting the market in bizarre ways. In order to talk about that, I have to first define a term: owner-operator. Owner-operators are equities where the management happens to be the largest shareholders. That is how they become the management. The wealth of the proprietors is tied into the company. If the shareholder isn't successful, the proprietor can't be financially successful. That is what an owner-operator is. Enlarge Image Close "If management gets their shares for free, I hardly think their interests are aligned" with those of other shareholders. —Murray Stahl Matthew Furhman for Barron's Jeremy Siegel in The Future for Investors studies the IPO market and rightly concludes that initial public offerings have a predictive tendency to produce unsatisfactory results in comparison to different indices. He gives you a table of IPOs that were very successful. It is a minority. Each and every one is owner-operated. Boards give managers shares. That's the crucial operative term, "give shares." Other shareholders had to buy their shares. If management gets their shares for free, I hardly think their interests are aligned. They have a variety of modalities for increasing their wealth, one of which happens to be the shares. I only have one favorable outcome; they have many. ETFs are largely constructed on a market-capitalization-weight, float-adjusted basis. It's never this obvious, but consider a company where management owns a lot of stock and is buying more. At the margin, the stock's weighting in the exchange-traded fund would be reduced. Why? Assuming everything else remains the same, the float is being reduced. Let's take the other extreme case, in which management has sold all their shares. From an ETF perspective, the float increased. Therefore, its weight in the index would more nearly approximate its market capitalization. The exchange-traded fund structure de facto does the opposite of what the insiders do. I find that rather intriguing. What are the ramifications? To begin with, owner-operated companies trade at very low valuations. Eventually, the market corrects that. A more major consequence is that if you examine the S&P 500 since 1957, and the exercise was to find the best stocks, you'd find Wal-Mart WMT -1.5344528083381586% Wal-Mart Stores Inc.

Now let's perform the exercise of calculating the S&P as if those companies never existed and were never in it. I promise you that you would never buy the resulting rump S&P, which would probably have returned half of what it was historically. We looked at the 80 owner-operators in Japan and compared them to the three primary indexes: the MSCI Japan, the Topix and the Nikkei. The difference in return was significant per annum. The individual investor should understand that, historically, indexation provided the rates of return it did because of the presence of a given number of owner-operators. Are you saying that individuals shouldn't be in exchange-traded funds? No. Indexation is a very sound idea. I'm really saying that someone should design an ETF that incorporates consciously the owner-operator element. "How They Did It" is a fascinating section in your publications that profiles successful people. Whom did you find most useful? When I went to college, I was interested in economics because as a very naïve person I thought I would learn to make money from the masters. I was absolutely aghast when I learned most of the masters were broke. Karl Marx was destitute most of his life, and if Friedrich Engels hadn't provided financial assistance, who knows what would have happened? There's an apocryphal remark from Marx's wife: "If Karl Marx invested more time into making Das Kapital than writing Das Kapital, his family would have been better off." So I decided to read the lives of people who were financially successful. It is the most interesting part of the whole field of finance. Benjamin Franklin stands head and shoulders above everyone else. For example, during the time of the French and Indian Wars, the Assembly of Philadelphia felt the city might be attacked. But Philadelphia was a Quaker city, and the Quakers were uninterested in violence. Franklin asked if they were opposed to storing grain, because the granaries might be burned in an invasion. They said, "Of course not," and donated money for grain. He went and bought gunpowder on the premise that it's a grainy substance. He wanted to buy artillery from the governor of New York, who wouldn't sell. So Franklin invited him to dinner. He wrote, "After the first bottle of Madeira, I had my first cannon. After the second I had several more. Had I stayed, I could have had them all." Eugene Meyer had very useful insights. He bought 51% of Boston Consolidated, which owned the worst-managed copper mining properties in 1907 or 1908, for one reason: It controlled the upper half of a mountain in Utah and the Guggenheim family controlled the bottom half. They had the technology to extract copper from low-grade ores, which they wouldn't share with Consolidated. But you can't mine the bottom half of a mountain without having the cooperation of the people who own the top half, unless you're not worried about things like avalanches and cave-ins. That's not an asset you find on a balance sheet. Frequently, the qualitative dimension is more important than the quantitative. The insights of most of these people are completely qualitative, rarely properly digested by the market. You've written a lot about unsustainable profitability, but the companies in the S&P 500 are continuing to beat estimates. The stock prices clearly reflect unsustainability. Even the worldwide debt crisis plays a role in the unsustainability. Federal spending since 1933 has grown at 9.03% a year. Sooner or later, governments, to alleviate their distress, might raise taxes. That's another way of achieving lower profit margins. How does the market look to you? The stock market will produce very uninspiring results for many years to come. Part of it is the unsustainability of profit margins. Part of it is the debt crisis. In the S&P, a lot of companies already dominate their industries -- food, utilities, drugs. Companies might acquire competitors. But statistically, most acquisitions aren't well-thought-out. They could return cash to shareholders, but if the yield is 2%-3%, you only get that yield and if you buy back a stock at a P/E of, say, 14 to 15 times, invert that and you get a sevenish percent return. Uninspiring. I invite people to undertake this exercise: Take any stock you like, and instead of buying it, make believe you wrote a put option on it, which gives you the right to sell a security at a predefined price. So you sold a put option with a six-month expiration. What happens? You earn a premium. And let's make believe that the stock was completely unchanged for a year. You wrote a put option collecting a premium, the option expired worthless, and you wrote another premium for the remaining six months.

Of course, it is never a steady-state world. But assuming it were, the premium of virtually any stock is double-digit—that's the return people want to get from the equity, but might not. Now if the stock price is unchanged, that is the rate of return. If the equity goes up in value, you earn that rate of return. If the equity goes down in value, your underlying position is marked down, but you have the cushion of the premium that you collected. If the premiums over the year totaled 12% or 14%, the stock has to decline by 12% or 14% for you to reach breakeven. Our Kinetics Multi-Disciplinary Fund [KMDNX] pursues this strategy. It is similar to equities in terms of its rate of return, but much less volatile. People are looking for that. It works great in an IRA account, in a foundation, anything tax-exempt. Even on a taxable basis, I dare say it will provide an acceptable rate of return. What do you think of emerging markets? They have been a disappointment over the 25 years I've been investing. I don't think they provide the rate of return that justifies the risk. A well-managed emerging- market fund probably returned 12-ish percent over 20 to 25 years. If you're a taxable individual living in the State of New York, if your net after-tax result were in the single digits, would you invest? Most people would decline. The maximum corporate profits are earned when there is little competition. Look at any emerging-market index and see how many companies populate any industry group, with more on the way. I suppose, compared with the uninspiring U.S. equity market, emerging markets look very good. But would I buy an emerging-markets index? No. But there might be splendid emerging-market companies that provide truly unique rates of return. In that case, investment is warranted. Let's talk about stocks. What do you like?

It's better to invest in the ETF company as a business than in exchange-traded funds themselves. WisdomTree is exploring interesting new opportunities, like emerging-currency and debt funds, short-term investments with higher yields and undervalued currencies. WisdomTree's earnings-weighted exchange-traded funds make more sense than the market-capitalization-weighted ETFs. When I bought it, the company traded for roughly 3% of assets under management. It now trades at 7%. I think it will be acquired in a couple of years by a large mutual-fund complex or bank or brokerage that would like to be in exchange-traded funds and wants a revenue stream. Individuals are very unlikely to return to traditional mutual-fund investing where you can exit the investment only after 4 p.m. There are only a handful of large ETF companies. WisdomTree is eighth on the list. The market cap is around $800 million. WisdomTree has minimal earnings. It has invested virtually all of its cash flow into growing the business. The company is now at $13.3 billion of assets, versus less than $4 billion a year ago. If the average fee is 55 basis points [hundredths of a percentage point], that's $70 million of fee income that could become $70 million of operating income on an existing platform. You are paying $800 million for $70 million of income with very high growth rates. An informed buyer might pay $14 or $15 a share.

Why? CBOE just announced July volume up 13%. The operative thing is to look at the volume of the VIX [volatility] contract. The VIX is the company's most valuable asset, only about 2% of volume, but growing 334% a year. In the fullness of time, about three or four years from now, the vehicle of choice for hedging a portfolio will not be the S&P 500 futures contract; it will be the VIX because it's so much more volatile than the S&P. This is a very unique exchange. It has proprietary properties like the VIX and is using that to branch into other volatility trades like the gold VIX, a recent creation that ultimately will probably be successful as well. But that VIX contract is extremely valuable. It has first-mover advantage. I think it is worth in three to four years more than the whole CBOE. The company trades at 15 times earnings; that's not a bargain. The issue is that ultimately it will produce a great deal of earnings. Beijing Capital International Airports [694.Hong Kong] is like CBOE in that both have very little in the way of variable cost. If 10,000 more passengers come into the airport, if someone trades an extra 10,000 VIX contracts, the cost of operating doesn't go up. Prior to 2008, the airport was very profitable. Then it doubled in size and more than doubled operating expenses. Passenger traffic went up, so the airport was more or less breakeven. It has a high growth rate. They're at the stage where increased passenger throughput goes to the bottom line. They preannounced earnings that are vastly higher than forecasts. It trades at 20 times. To judge its future profitability, compare it to Australian-listed MAp Airports, which owns 30%-plus of the Brussels and Copenhagen airports and 74% of Sydney. Its proportion of the traffic is about 40 million passengers a year. Now the Beijing Airport gets more than 70 million passengers a year. MAp's fixed costs are much lower than Beijing's. MAp's airports earn $400 million a year. Beijing Airports earns something like $100 million, but once it achieves the proper economies of scale, it will earn much more than MAp. MAp has a market cap of roughly about $6 billion. And Beijing has a market cap of $2 billion. I think it's worth more than MAp. Anything you dislike? Carmike Cinemas [CKEC]. The average ticket price is increasing at a small rate each year, but attendance is declining 1% to 2% a year, and rents go up every year with a 3% escalator. We're at a point where given competition and other venues of entertainment, it's very hard to raise prices. Margins are razor thin. I think the profitability goes away in 24 months or less.

In addition to a redesign, which was already known, Kuo reports Apple will finally introduce a wireless charging mat for all new iPhones, as well as fast-wired charging. Kuo also says there will be three new iPhone models coming. Two iPhone 7S upgrades, and the new iPhone 8 / iPhone X, which will commemorate the 10th anniversary of the first iPhone. Apparently the price hike will be generated because of the new technology required to make the fast-charge capabilities feasible. The new phones will need a new graphite later and 3D Touch module, and will push the price of the phone to over $1,000. A separate report confirmed these numbers. While this may seem like a fortune to pay for a phone, iPhone users will likely return to get the newest model, as evidenced by the sales of the new MacBook Pro that also shared a price increase. One issue some take up is the necessity of the new 3D Touch module, that many will use, but many users will probably completely forget about. The new iPhone will also have to compete with the newly redesigned Samsung Galaxy 8 and the second generation Google Pixel phone.

Picture by Debra Hurford Brown Janet Christie 00:06 Saturday 11 February 2017 0 Have your say Apple Tree Yard, Catastrophe, Unforgotten, Porridge, the Edinburgh actor is all over our screens but he isn’t taking anything for granted Sunday night on a sofa in Hertfordshire and the actor Mark Bonnar and his wife Lucy are sitting watching his latest show, Apple Tree Yard. A gripping psychological thriller from the BBC starring Bonnar and Emily Watson, it followed the downward trajectory of a successful, happily married scientist and her husband, from domesticity to the dock. Mark Bonnar with Emily Watson in Apple Tree Yard. Picture: Colin Hutton “Oh My God,” says Lucy in response to a shocking turn of events. She hadn’t seen that coming. And neither had we, but then we’re not married to one of the stars. You’d think her husband would have given her a head’s up on what was about to unfold. “No, we don’t do that,” says Bonnar. “This way you get a proper honest reaction and it’s more exciting to watch.” Usually Bonnar hasn’t seen the final cut of the show either, preferring to watch it on the sofa with Lucy. Lucy is an actor too – Lucy Gaskell of Cutting It, Being Human, Misfits and Crossing Lines fame and they met in a production of The Cherry Orchard, so her reaction is something Bonnar appreciates. “I like to see how she takes it, and she likes to see my reaction to her work. With Apple Tree Yard we’ve had several ‘Oh My Gods’. That’s always a good sound to come from the other end of the couch.” Having a wife in the same business is a boon, especially since the 48-year-old RSAMD graduate, who’s been in everything from Taggart to Casualty to Line of Duty, is all over TV at the moment. “It’s great because they know what you’re talking about. You can get home, moan about the job and not have to explain,” he says. As well as Apple Tree Yard, Bonnar has just finished ITV crime drama Unforgotten, and later in the year he’s back with Catastrophe, Rob Delaney and Sharon Horgan’s BAFTA-winning comedy, then another comedy with Porridge, a reboot of the 1970s sitcom from the original writers Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais and next year BBC’s Shetland once more. If you’re a gamer, you’ll recognise his voice from Black Flag, Battlefield and Assassin’s Creed, and if you’re one of his children – Martha, five, and Samuel, almost two – you’ll be delighted to hear him voicing Twigs, a sprite sidekick to Tree Fu Tom, a woodland creature with superpowers on CBeebies. “I took that over from David Tennant,” he says, “and Martha’s old enough to know vaguely what we do, so when that comes on she goes, ‘is this your one daddy?’ and I say ‘yes’, or ‘no, it’s the other bloke, whatshisname.’” He laughs. Apple Tree Yard was the adaptation of Louise Doughty’s bestselling crime drama that explored what happened when a conscientious scientist embarked on an affair with a stranger and her life went into freefall. Bonnar played the scientist’s husband, Gary Carmichael, another scientist, and a dependable family man. “He’s a studious, quiet, emotionally reserved guy,” says Bonnar. “There’s nothing extraordinary about him. But it’s when things happen to him that you find the true mark of the man. He’s stalwart and steadfast and fairly honourable.” Ah, but is he? I tell Bonnar that opinion on the sofa in my house was divided over whether Gary was quite as honourable as he first appeared. “I hope it does raise those kind of questions. Trust and betrayal are two huge themes; the nature of long-term love and relationships, and passion.” There’s been a lot of reaction to the four-part drama, thanks to the skilful way it flipped between genres, from romance to crime, and both praise and criticism for an honest portrayal of rape. Much has been made of the broom cupboard/up a close sex with a stranger that injected passion into Emily Watson’s middle class, middle aged life, and all with a remarkable lack of skin on show. “There’s no need to show a lot of flesh,” says Bonnar. “It’s not about that. It’s about somebody being deeply attracted to somebody and having sex with them. It just so happens that they’re the age they are, so yes it’s an honest portrayal of people in their middle age who are still passionate. As people in middle age are. As are people in their seventies. It’s not all about the youth.” He goes on, warming to his theme, “It’s honest. Bodies don’t glisten and things don’t move seamlessly from a kiss to suddenly it’s sex. It shows the fumbles, the foot in the bucket in the broom cupboard, the Spanx getting taken off, all the awkward bits that are actually funny. I mean sex can be funny for heaven’s sake.” Bonnar is clearly happy in his own skin and revelling in the roles coming his way. You could say he’s come into his prime at, is it 48? “I am. Good good. My daughter said it earlier on. ‘Are you 48 now daddy?’ I said ‘Yes,’ thinking where’s this going and she said ‘just checking’. Thanks, thanks for reminding me.” But with age comes complexity – from Chris in Catastrophe to DCC Mike Dryden in Line of Duty – would he be able to play them if he were 28? “Well, no absolutely not. You’re right. It’s a good age to be. It’s the right age to be for me.” A different night in the Bonnar Gaskell household would have found the pair goggleboxing another of Mark’s recent shows, ITV crime drama Unforgotten. Created and written by Chris Lang, it follows two London detectives solving cold cases with Bonnar playing barrister Colin Osbourne, another character who was not all that he seemed. Again, the suspense was ramped up to the max with viewers desperate to know what happened next, the question that landed Bonnar the role. “I’d only been given the first three episodes and they ended with a reveal, so my first question in the audition was, ‘What happens?’. They wouldn’t tell me so I thought, I need to do it now! It’s a real page turner and that’s what attracts you to any story, whether it’s a book or a script or a play. You want to be grabbed and taken through it.” All is quiet in the Bonnar household when we talk. It’s 8pm and the kids are in bed. “That’s not to say they won’t come charging down the stairs at any moment,” says Bonnar, and laughs, his voice as smooth and warm as a slug of Glenkinchie single malt, matured not too far from his teenage years home in Tranent, pouring down the phone. Lookswise, Lucy has him as a cross between Simon Pegg and Rufus Sewell, according to Bonnar. “She’s shown me photographic evidence where I do look like Simon Pegg,” he says, “but Rufus Sewell? I should be so bloody lucky!” Bonnar laughs a lot, full of enthusiasm and energy, which he needs with a young family for him and Gaskell to balance with their work. This spring he’ll be in Glasgow and Shetland playing Duncan Hunter in the fourth series of Shetland. “Lots of people work away, you just have to deal with it and it’s great you can FaceTime to say goodnight to the children. Even if you’re going to be working really long hours, you know it’s only going to last for a few months; that’s the beauty and curse of the job. And I love doing Shetland: it’s a great bunch of people. I’m very fond of Dougie [Henshall] and Alison [O’Donnell]. It was brilliant before, but I think the last series especially hit its mark.” So, with Line of Duty, The Bill, Taggart and Shetland, he’s done a lot of crime in his time. “That was a long time ago and I’d rather not talk about it,” he jokes. “And if I had I wouldn’t share it.” Quite right, but to what does he credit the current popularity of crime as a genre? “Crime makes for great drama and it’s interesting because it delves into the darker side of us. Those kind of stories go way back, the detective and the criminal. I mean Sherlock’s still around for goodness’ sake. If it’s well written it’s one of the most original and best forms of drama and satisfying to the viewer. And something like Unforgotten is impressive with the myriad threads of people’s lives so brilliantly woven together.” Crime can also be funny, especially if it’s Porridge, with Bonnar appearing in a reboot of the hugely successful 1970s sitcom. The series was commissioned after a successful one-off episode with comedian Kevin Bishop playing the original Fletch’s grandson, Nigel, and Bonnar taking on the role of his nemesis, warder Meech, with a passing nod to Fulton Mackay. Filming will be in front of a live studio audience. “Meekie is an updated version, a wee tip of the hat. He stands on his own two feet, but obviously there’s a soupçon of Fulton in there, how could there not be?” Updates in the new Porridge include requests for gluten-free granola instead of porridge and Fletch’s grandson doing time for cybercrimes. “I love the way they manage to step into the present and yet it’s just like the old days. ‘A warm hug from an old friend’, as one of my pals texted me to say after he’d watched it. I’m very, very excited about starting it, and in equal measure, terrified.” Also coming to a couch near you this year is a return of Catastrophe, in which Bonnar plays the hilariously gloomy existentialist Chris. Will he get back with uptight wife Fran, played by Ashley Jensen, or continue exploring his sexuality – a journey that saw him hiding bewildered in a cloud of his own vape smoke in the toilet of a gay haunt last season? “Chris is brilliant fun to play because nothing’s too ridiculous or out there and they kind of let me do what I want,” says Bonnar. “He’s weird, wonderful, witty, sardonic, scary… unsettlingly hilarious.” Catastrophe also gave Bonnar the chance to work alongside the late actor Carrie Fisher, in her last TV role just before she died. “She was fantastic, a wonderful warm, hilarious person. I found myself sitting beside her in between set ups one day and we had a great big chat where she was telling me about her past and what a life she had. Obviously I grew up with Star Wars and I’m a huge fan of hers, so it was a real golden moment to have in my heart, especially now that she’s tragically gone at such a ridiculous age. I’ve got a photo of the three of us, me, Carrie and her dog Gary.” Comedy was always something Bonnar wanted to do more of. “I was brought up on it, Laurel and Hardy, Monty Python, The Goodies, Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy. I love all that kind of slightly skew-whiff, dark, unsettling hilarious stuff, that’s my bag, so Chris is a kind of gift really. He’s got Laurel and Hardy and Tom and Jerry in him, because I have too.” The son of Rosie and Stan, a former social worker and an artist, Edinburgh-born Bonnar enjoyed drama at Leith Academy, but didn’t pursue it. However after spells in Edinburgh city libraries and planning department after school, he was persuaded to join Leith Theatre, where someone suggested drama school. “I thought, oh right, you can do this as a job? I’d never thought of it in that way.” Back at Telford College he did a National Certificate in drama then a degree at the RSAMD where winning a BBC radio award in his final year took him to London. Theatre work saw him at the RSC and National Theatre, then he made his TV debut in an adaptation of Ian Rankin’s Rebus. Bruno Jenkins in Casualty followed and since then he’s racked up everything from The Bill to Silent Witness. In Unforgotten, Catastrophe and Apple Tree Yard, whether crime or comedy, all have a focus on relationships, and in Unforgotten Bonnar’s character is at the centre of an adoption drama. How does he feel about dad roles now that he has children? “I think it resonates more now than it used to. I think your emotional thermometer is a little higher and you feel things more acutely if it’s about kids. It’s easier to draw on initially when you’re first doing it and then you can let the scene take over.” For Bonnar having kids is “wonderful”. “I always thought it would be but you can’t plan anything in this job. So I never planned, but it was wonderful when it happened. It makes you think about everything differently, including your own parents. Obviously I’m of more advanced years than they were when they were new parents, so knowing what I was like when I was their age, God knows how I would have been as a parent if I’d been younger.” So getting older suits Bonnar all round and only seems to add to the parts he’s being offered. There were times when the jobs didn’t come so thick and fast and he has been out of work for a year on two occasions. “It’s a long time. You’ve got to steady yourself and think maybe I should do something else, but luckily it’s never come to that. You keep the wolf from the door doing bits and bobs, voiceovers. As long as the story is good and the part interesting it doesn’t matter if it’s TV, theatre, radio... I love radio, because imagination is key for the person listening, and it’s a very intimate, your voice in someone’s ear. There are all kinds of wonderful facets to different bits of this job.” At the moment, Bonnar has plenty of work to keep him busy, but there’s no sign of him getting complacent. “Yes, it’s been a very nice two, three years, but you are always counting your blessings.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile  ⋮  Software iOS 10.3 Public Beta 2 for iPhone & iPad Released By Uzair Ghani Feb 7, 2017 7Shares Share Tweet Submit You can now download iOS 10.3 Public Beta 2 for your iPhone or iPad. The update process is simple, and you can try out the build for free if you want. iOS 10.3 Public Beta 2 is Now Available for Beta Testers – Update Today Apart from the developer oriented betas which Apple releases on a regular basis, you’ll be pleased to learn that the company has a dedicated program for public testers as well. Using this program, you can try out the latest iOS and macOS beta builds on your device without having to throw $99 on an Apple Developer Program membership. Currently, Apple has iOS 10.3 and macOS 10.12.4 up for testing. Today, the former has been updated to Beta 2, bringing forth bug fixes and performance enhancements. In case you are wondering, iOS 10.3 Beta brings to the table a lot of great new features such as Find My AirPods and more. Basically, it’s an update which no one should skip, until or unless you have good reason to do so. Advertisement If you have iOS 10.3 Public Beta 1 installed on your iPhone or iPad, then updating to the latest release is a piece of cake. Simply connect to a WiFi network, navigate to Settings > General > Software Update and install the available update from there. And since you will be required to restart your device therefore be ready to do so. It’s best to leave your iPhone or iPad on charge during the installation process, ensuring things are all nice and juiced up. iOS 10.3 Beta 2 Along with watchOS 3.2, tvOS 10.2 Beta 2 Released Once the installation is complete and your device has booted up, you can use it as you normally would. But remember, if you are installing Public Beta software for the first time, make sure you are well aware of all the risks that come attached with beta software. It’s buggy, and things can go south without prior notice. But ultimately, the final decision whether or not you wish to install the software on your iPhone, iPad or any other device, lies with you. While you are at it though, make sure you send those important crash reports back to Apple though. This will help the company push out an even more stable build to the public.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile  ⋮  Report Apple Watch Took Half of All Smartwatch Sales for Q4 2016, Claims Analyst By Omar Sohail Feb 7, 2017 12Shares Share Tweet Submit Another report coming from different analysts shows that Apple not just enjoyed a great Q4 2016 financial run with its iPhones, but with its Apple Watch lineup as well. Despite the high asking price of the company’s wearables, their key selling points definitely have to do with the integrated software ecosystem that the company has made and improved overtime. Apple Watch Accounted for Nearly 80 Percent of the Smartwatch Revenue for Q4 2016 A completely different report compiled by Canalys states the following about the sales performance of Apple Watch: “Apple set a new quarterly shipment record in Q4 2016, contributing to total smartwatch shipments exceeding 9 million units. This global market figure was largely driven by Apple’s 6 million shipments, representing year-on-year growth of 12%. It was the Apple Watch’s best quarter despite being significantly handicapped by supply constraints, even though Apple simultaneously expanded its supply chain. According to Canalys estimates, the Apple Watch generated more than US$2.6 billion in revenue for Apple in Q4 2016, making up nearly 80% of total smartwatch revenue.” Analyst Jason Low claims that the reason why Apple was able to sell more devices was not only due to hardware and yearly software improvements, but improved pricing variables which attracted a larger crowd to the product: “Apart from the hardware and software improvements of the new models, Apple succeeded mainly due to its streamlined marketing and re-aligned pricing, which helped it address a wider audience. The Series 1’s lower entry price and Apple’s more focused fitness messaging made its Watch both more attainable and more relevant.” Advertisement Canalys also estimates that Apple shipped 11.9 million smartwatches during the entire 2016 period, resulting in a global market share of 50 percent. 'Theater Mode' is on its Way, But for Apple Watch Users Running watchOS 3.2 A different report suggests that the smartwatch industry was up 1 percent year-over-year to 8.2 million in 2016. The reason for that growth is thanks to the impressive Apple Watch’s success during the holiday quarter. Apple also managed to surpass Samsung for the ‘Q4 2016 top smartphone vendor’ achievement, even though the Korean tech giant managed to sell more phones than Apple in the entire year. Apple seems to have no competitor; Samsung reported just 800,000 smartwatch shipments during the holiday quarter, down 38 percent year-over-year from 1.3 million in Q4 of 2015, showing the dominance of the California-based giant. We can only assume the improvements that the next Apple Watch is going to be incorporated with.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Accessories Image Source: Beats Apple’s Beats X wireless earbuds will launch later this week Chris Mills @chrisfmills February 7th, 2017 at 11:19 AM Share Tweet Apple’s been having a bad time with its world-changing headphones lately. When the iPhone 7 was announced without a headphone jack, Apple tried to ease everyone’s concerns by announcing a full lineup of wireless headphones. Unfortunately, problems with the technology caused the flagship Airpods to be delayed by months, and the cheaper Beats X did even worse. But according to Apple, the wait is over, and the Beats X will be globally available starting this Friday, February 10th. Don't Miss: Report claims Apple’s next revolutionary product might be released later this year The headphones cost $149.95, and come in white, black, grey and blue. The Beats X are likely to be a popular middle ground between cumbersome over-ear wireless headphones, and the Airpods that are just a little too easy to lose. The Beats X share significant technology with the Airpods, including Apple’s proprietary W1 wireless chip that enables easy pairing to iOS or Mac devices. They are also compatible (but less fun to use) with Android devices. Other than the Apple chip, the Beats X look similar to other wireless earbuds already on the market. There’s a cable linking both buds, with an in-line remote and battery that should give around 8 hours of runtime. Charging is provided via a Lightning cable rather than the more usual micro-USB, which will probably be the death knell for any Android users who were thinking about picking up a pair.

Alibaba stock has pulled back after easing from record-breaking earnings By Joseph Hargett, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Feb 7, 2017, 9:56 am EST     Popular Posts: Tuesday’s Vital Data: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

(AAPL) Stock Due for a Correction? View All Posts If you missed out on the post-earnings rally for Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE:BABA), your chance has come back around again. After rallying to $105 following a record-breaking earnings report, Alibaba stock has pulled back to the psychologically significant $100 area, marking a prime entry point for a long position as BABA eyes all-time highs. Click to Enlarge Alibaba stock has spent the past several sessions consolidating into the $100 region, helping the shares to blow off an overbought condition. Not only is $100 home to key technical and sentiment support, BABA’s 20-day moving average is also rising into the area, providing an additional springboard for the shares. As for sentiment, Wall Street remains widely bullish on Alibaba stock. According to data from Thomson/First Call, analysts have doled out just five “hold” ratings compared to 37 “buy” or better ratings. Additionally, the 12-month consensus price target of $125.19 represents a roughly 25% premium to Monday’s close. Short sellers, however, aren’t so keen on Alibaba stock. During the most recent reporting period, the number of BABA shares sold short rose by 4% to 114 million shares, or roughly 10.5% of the stock’s total float. As Alibaba stock rallies off support at $100, these shorts may be forced to buy back their bets, thus adding fuel to the fire for BABA shares. That said, short sellers may be a bit nervous right now, if BABA’s options activity is any indication. Currently, the March put/call open interest ratio for Alibaba stock rests at 0.61, with calls nearly doubling puts among options set to expire within the next two months. In other words, either BABA call traders are betting on a continued rally, or short sellers are hedging their bets with purchased calls. Either way, this high degree of call OI is a bullish indicator for Alibaba stock. 2 Trades for Alibaba Stock Call Spread: For those looking to bet on a Alibaba stock bounce from $100, a March $105/$110 bull call spread has some impressive profit potential. At last check, this spread was offered at 94 cents, or $94 per pair of contracts. Breakeven lies at $105.94, while a maximum profit of $4.06, or $406 per pair of contracts, is possible if Alibaba stock trades at or above $110 when March options expire next month. Put Sell: If a more neutral positions suits your trading style more, then a BABA March $97.50 put sell position has a solid chance at finishing out of the money. At last check, this put was bid at $1.44, or $144 per contract. Remember that you keep the initial premium received as long as Alibaba stock closes above $97.50 when March options expire. However, if BABA trades below $97.50 ahead of expiration, you could be assigned 100 shares of BABA stock for every put sold at a cost of $97.50 per share. As of this writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

(AAPL) Stock Due for a Correction? View All Posts U.S. stock futures are in rally mode this morning, after General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) bolstered premarket sentiment with its fourth-quarter earnings beat. Additionally, stocks are being bolstered by a rising U.S. dollar, which is up nearly 1% after Philadelphia Federal Reserve President Patrick Harker said late yesterday that a March interest rate hike was “on the table.” At last check, futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average had advanced 0.23%, while S&P 500 futures were up 0.29% and Nasdaq-100 futures were higher by 0.21%. On the options front, volume plummeted on Monday following Friday’s brisk session. On the day, only about 11.4 million calls and 11.8 million puts changed hands — coming in well below average. Over on the CBOE, the single-session equity put/call volume ratio leapt to 0.75, though the 10-day moving average held at 0.69 for the fourth straight session. Turning to Monday’s volume leaders, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) surged more than 11% after rumors hit the Street that the company was collaborating with chief rival Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC). Elsewhere, Twitter Inc (NYSE:TWTR) call traders continued to ramp up their positions heading into Thursday’s quarterly earnings report, and Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) short sellers appear to be hedging their positions. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) AMD stock is on fire and call options traders were chomping at the bit to get in on the run on Monday. Driving AMD’s latest rally was news that Intel was licensing AMD GPU technology. According to Kyle Bennet, editor in chief at HardOCP: “Intel is licensing AMD GPU technology. No money has changed hands yet, so there is no financial impact till late in the year, hence nothing in the current earnings report. The first product AMD is working on for Intel is a Kaby Lake processor variant … It is scheduled to come to market before the end of the year. I would expect more collaboration between AMD and Intel in the future on the graphics side.” If true, the Intel collaboration would be huge for AMD, potentially giving the company a leg up on its main GPU competitor, Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). AMD options traders apparently came to the same conclusion, as more than 670,000 contracts traded on the stock yesterday, with calls accounting for 64% of the day’s take. Some of the more aggressive speculators have taken out considerable overhead call positions in the soon-to-expire 10 Feb series, where some 4,700 contacts are open at the $14 strike, with another 2,000-plus at $14.50.

Apple itself doesn’t break out numbers on the Apple Watch, but these researchers have done the dirty work to uncover figures which they believe are accurate. According to findings in their report, Apple shipped as many as six million Apple Watch devices during the quarter, which generated around $2.6 Billion worth of revenue for the company. These are incredible figures as according to industry experts, only 9 million smart watches were shipped across all brands globally in that quarter. In fact, according to these figures, it means Apple is responsible for almost half of all Smart watch sales in 2016, with 11.9 million sale across its different versions for the year. This figure represents around 50% of total market sales across the globe and almost 80% of its total revenue. The revenue part shouldn’t surprise considering that Apple charges far more than its competitors, but it’s the sheer number of sales that I find unfathomable. According to Canalys, a smart watch is classified as multi-purpose devices that serve as accessories to smart devices, are designed to be worn on the body and not carried, run an operating system and can run third-party computing applications. This definition suggests these figures also include the likes of Garmin, TomTom, Fitbit and Suunto who all make GPS watches that run 3rd party apps and integrate with various mobile phones. The numbers are surprising though and I do suspect some of these manufacturers may have been left off.  I’m also not sure how accurately these figures portray the global markets, as not every market has this information readily available, but still – the numbers do paint a reliable analysis of the industry.  None of these small discrepancies though change the fact that the Apple Watch is by far the biggest-selling smart watch on the market. I only had a brief exposure to the Apple Watch when it first released and I personally found it be one of the worst smart watches on the market. Yes, its interface is nice and slick, but it’s very low on features, has terrible battery life, an inaccurate GPS and worst of all, overpriced considering many competitors are doing more for less. So, as you can imagine, this success takes me by surprise. I was convinced it was doomed to fail from its inception, but I guess I have been proven wrong – yet again. Apple has been working hard on making the device a success, and these things may have improved since. I don’t intend to put down Apple fans and people who own an Apple Watch – you clearly love the device. I’m just one person that can’t get my head around why Apple has been so successful with it. I guess, it’s not just about the technology, but the marketing power behind it. And Apple are the experts at marketing themselves – you have to give them that. Are you an Apple Watch owner? Do you think their market strength is justified and I just have sour grapes or are the other manufacturers just missing some marketing tricks?

The tech giant's chief executive said governments should wage information wars against fake news reports and businesses should create tools to root out propaganda. Fake stories have dominated social media during highly divisive political campaigns, especially the US presidential election. Video: How to spot fake news online In the UK, the Culture, Media and Sports Committee is investigating the phenomenon over fears it could have a "significant impact" on democracy. Mr Cook told the Daily Telegraph a "massive campaign" was needed, involving a "modern version" of a public service announcement. He told the newspaper: "We are going through this period of time right here where unfortunately some of the people that are winning are the people that spend their time trying to get the most clicks, not tell the most truth. "It's killing people's minds in a way. "All of us technology companies need to create some tools that help diminish the volume of fake news." Video: Impact of fake news on people and politics Fake news is often placed on websites that masquerade as media outlets. Examples that have gone viral include "Pope Francis endorses Donald Trump for president" and "ISIS leader calls for American Muslim voters to support Hillary Clinton". It comes after rapper Drake said he had been the victim of a "fake media story" following claims he told a woman to remove her hijab at one of his concerts in London. Video: Hillary Clinton warns of fake news 'epidemic' The Canadian musician responded to a video posted on social media in which he was heard telling a fan to take off her scarf. In a post on Instagram, he denied the woman was wearing a hijab and said he "would never make a disrespectful comment like that". He wrote: "I make a point every night to end my shows on tones of unity and love so to find out that I am being utilised in a fake media story about me disrespecting Muslims is devastating to me." I make a point every night to end my shows on tones of unity and love so, to find out that I am being utilized in a fake media story about me disrespecting Muslims is devastating to me. At my show in the 02 in London I was talking to 4 women one of whom was wearing a jacket and a winter scarf, I made a comment about taking off the scarf because I enjoy friendly banter with the fans. I am well aware of what a hijab is and I would never make a disrespectful comment like that in my life towards someone who is wearing one. I am proud that my closest friends and fans come from all different religions and races, perhaps whoever made up this story should spend more time learning about other cultures and less time trying to divide us. A photo posted by champagnepapi (@champagnepapi) on Feb 10, 2017 at 3:24pm PST The singer said he had been talking to four women at his gig at the O2 Arena and one of them was wearing a winter scarf. He added: "I made a comment about taking off the scarf because I enjoy friendly banter with the fans. "I am well aware of what a hijab is and I would never make a disrespectful comment like that in my life towards someone who is wearing one."

The Stars Are Blind singer, who was born in the Big Apple, was snapped Friday boarding a vehicle amid snowy conditions to check out the on-goings as fashion fever overtakes the city that never sleeps for New York Fashion Week. The 35-year-old socialite matched well with a black and red leather jacket, a black top, black leather pants and black high tops with white out-soles. Happy day: Paris Hilton, 35, was snapped boarding a vehicle in New York City on Friday in a stylish get-up Swagger: The socialite didn't seem to be lacking in confidence as she made her way to her ride Where to? The blonde beauty kept warm in leather pants as she ventured into Gotham on the freezing Friday The wealthy fashionista, wearing her long blonde mane down under a black hat with cat ears, accessorized with a multi-colored floral-patterned purse as she boarded a vehicle presumably to take her to the couture-themed happenings. The 5ft8 beauty is not just there to check out the latest styles, but put on her modeling shoes as well, as she walked in Christian Cowan's Thursday showcase, prancing the catwalk for the upstart British designer. 'Now this is how you close a show! Loved my finale look on the runway tonight,' The Simple Life star said on her Instagram page, along with an image of her decked out in an eye-popping silver ensemble that included a royal crown.  Multi-talented: Paris has left her fingerprints in a number of industries, including modeling, music and television Work and play: Paris looked relaxed just a day after walking the runway for innovative designer Christian Cowan  In a nostalgic nod to both supermodels of yesteryear and the late George Michael, the pop icon's classic Freedom ’90 played as she made her triumphant strut down the runway. Paris, a New York Times Best-selling author for her 2004 tome Confessions of an Heiress, modeled another outfit for Cowan in the display, a a pink turtleneck and pencil skirt decked out with stars, which was likely an homage to her 2006 reggae hit, Stars Are Blind.

Apple’s next iPhone might cost more than $1000 thanks to OLED displays Posted yesterday by Jordan Crook (@jordanrcrook) 0 SHARES Next Story Twitter says product changes are main growth driver, not just the President’s usage iPhone rumor season is upon us — as if it ever ends — and the latest claims that the next iPhone will cost upwards of $1000 (at least, for the most expensive model). To be clear, that isn’t a huge deal considering that the top-of-the-line iPhone currently costs more than $900. Still, Fast Company reports that Apple may be switching from LCD displays to an OLED display, which would cost the company more to make the phone. The report also cites sources as saying that the memory in the next iPhone will be upgraded, another contributing factor to the rising cost. This forthcoming phone represents 10 years of the iPhone, leading many to believe that Apple may call it “iPhone X.” Rumors suggest that the next flagship iPhone will measure in at 5.8-inches, which is a bit bigger than the iPhone 7 Plus. Diverging a bit from the current strategy, the next iPhone is said to be released alongside two models that are the same size as the iPhone 7 (4.7-inch) and iPhone 7 Plus (5.5-inch), which will likely be called the iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus respectively. Trusted KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Quo wrote late last year that only the iPhone 8 (or iPhone X) will come with the new OLED display. Along with the new display and the bigger size, rumors suggest that the back of the phone will be made of glass, and that the sides of the phone will be made of stainless steel instead of aluminum. But perhaps more exciting is that Apple may be ditching the Home button, placing it under the display for a fully touch interface. In fact, sources are claiming that the next iPhone may not have any physical buttons, instead using touch-sensitive portions of metal for the volume/lock buttons. Of course, Apple isn’t expected to announce the next phone until Fall 2017, so nothing is set in stone. But if the OLED rumors in particular hold true, you might want to start prepping your bank account for a slightly more expensive purchase come September. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase iPhone 5 Description The iPhone 5 is a smartphone developed by Apple.

By Hyacinth Mascarenhas February 11, 2017 04:45 GMT Close Four top tips for avoiding fake news IBTimes UK Apple chief executive is calling on governments and technology firms to step up in the battle against fake news and misinformation online, dubbing it "one of today's chief problems." In an interview with the Daily Telegraph, Cook urged governments to launch a public information campaign to curb the spread of false news stories, hoaxes and misinformation that are "killing people's minds, in a way." "It has to be ingrained in the schools, it has to be ingrained in the public," Cook told the British publication. "There has to be a massive campaign. We have to think through every demographic. We need a modern version of a public service announcement campaign. It can be done quickly if there is a will. "We are going through this period of time right here where unfortunately some of the people that are winning are the people that spend their time trying to get the most clicks, not tell the most truth." Social media companies, news aggregators and other technology firms including Facebook and Google have drawn criticism over fake news and not doing enough to curb its dissemination, particularly during the recent US presidential election campaign season. Some critics believe the rampant spread of fake news and conspiracy theories online may have helped Donald Trump win the presidency. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg initially dismissed the claims as a "pretty crazy idea," but vowed to address the problem. The social media giant has rolled out a series of measures to weed out fake news from the platform such as making it easier for users to flag suspect articles and working with third-party fact checkers. According to a recent survey by the Pew Research Center, nearly a quarter of Americans polled admitted they have shared a fake news story, either knowingly or later finding it was false. About two in three US adults said faux news stories has sowed a great deal of confusion over basic facts of current events and issues. While 45% of US adults polled said government, politicians and elected officials bear significant responsibility for preventing fake stories from garnering attention, 43% said the responsibility falls on the public and another 42% said it falls on social networking sites and search engines. "All of us technology companies need to create some tools that help diminish the volume of fake news," Cook said. "We must try to squeeze this without stepping on freedom of speech and of the press, but we must also help the reader. Too many of us are just in the complaint category right now and haven't figure out what to do." Tim Cook is calling on governments and tech firms to help tackle the spread of fake news and misinformation.Bernd Thissen/AFP/Getty Images Cook said that the crackdown on fake news stories would also mean that "truthful, reliable, non-sensational, deep news outlets will win." "The [rise of fake news] is a short-term thing, I don't believe that people want that at the end of the day," he noted. He added that educating kids in school about the fake news phenomenon and the dangers associated with it could also help address the issue as well. Cook said, "It's almost as if a new course is required for the modern kid, for the digital kid," Cook said. "In some ways kids will be the easiest to educate. At least before a certain age, they are very much in listen and understand [mode], and they they push their parents to act. We saw this with environmental issues: kids learning at school and coming home and saying why do you have this plastic bottle? Why are you throwing it away?"

"The new stay-at-home economy is precisely what scares me about these stocks that depend on people going out," the "Mad Money" host explained. Quotes in the article NVIDIA Corp NVDA ▼ 113.62 -2.76 -2.37% Netflix Inc NFLX ▲ 144.82 +0.68 +0.47% Apple Inc AAPL ▼ 132.12 -0.30 -0.23% Facebook Inc FB ▲ 134.19 +0.05 +0.04% AdChoices Activision Blizzard (ATVI), the world's largest maker of video games reported a monster quarter on Thursday, sending the stock up 18 percent on Friday. Nvidia (NVDA) makes gaming chips, and also reported an insanely great number. Netflix (NFLX) hit a 52-week high, and so did Domino's Pizza (DPZ), with Amazon (AMZN) bouncing back behind it. Read more from CNBC's Jim Cramer The one thing that these stocks have in common is the "stay home, don't go out" theme. These are companies that thrive on people who stay home on their couches, order delivery, play games and watch TV while checking Facebook (FB) on their Apple (AAPL) iPhones. "This is the real enemy of retail and restaurants," Cramer said. Some can beat it, but Cramer said most cannot. Panera Bread (PNRA) reported strong earnings, but 25 percent of those sales came from digital, which means it was either takeout or delivery and that distinguishes them from the pack. Related gallery: 9 retailers that bombed last year 9 retailers that bombed in 2016 Costco (COST) hit an all-time high, but that is because it makes its money on memberships, not on foot traffic. So whether it is time management, or making things easier to do at home, stocks like Nvidia, Apple and Netflix are all coming together to prevent people from leaving the house, and that is what is killing bricks-and-mortar, Cramer said. "You need to be very careful with this cohort because the forces against retail traffic are numerous, they are powerful, they are not going away and they can only rarely be defeated," Cramer said.

My how things have changed. Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified) Under founder Bill Gates, DOS and then Windows operating systems were on virtually every computer that wasn’t an Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) machine. And that dominance continued unabated until the dotcom bubble burst. It wasn’t the ensuing crash that hurt, it was the fact that tech had reached a point of inflection. From then on, it wasn’t just about owning a fiber-optic switching company with a triple-digit price-to-earnings ratio. One of the sayings from those heady times was, if it doesn’t have a triple digit P/E, it’s not worth buying. The crash meant the internet and tech itself was growing up. There was plenty of consolidation that happened after the dotcom crash. Some worked out, some didn’t. But it was necessary for companies that were going to survive to find a way to pivot into the new marketplace. It was also around that time that Microsoft was embroiled in a major antitrust case with the U.S. Government. This meant that MSFT had to change on many levels, just to survive. It was crucial to find a way out of this, because most of the government computers were running Windows, and if Microsoft couldn’t find a bright path through the case, it may well lose a very lucrative long-term contract. By 2006, Gates was out of day-to-day operations and his No. 2, Steve Ballmer, took over. While he started strong, it wasn’t long until it was apparent that doing the same thing a little differently was not going to cut it as technology was expanding rapidly and interconnections were popping among different tech fields. In 2014, the current CEO, Satya Nadella, took the helm and began to completely reorganize the company, shedding unprofitable and unwieldy divisions and focusing on the future of the company. That meant cleaning up the mess created by the acquisition of the mobile phone business of Nokia and building a robust cloud-based business for both operating systems and for client storage.

 Apple has a firm grip on wireless headphones in the US Jeff Dunn Feb. 8, 2017, 5:26 PM 1,959 facebook linkedin twitter email print More Charts   It took five months, but Apple is finally ready to ship the last of its new batch of wireless headphones. The company on Tuesday announced that BeatsX, the neckband-style earphones from its Beats subsidiary, will go on sale and join the fully wireless AirPods, over-ear Solo 3 Wireless, and exercise-focused Powerbeats3 Wireless by the end of the week. As this chart from Statista shows, the new pair should only bolster Beats’ already-dominant position in the wireless headphone market. According to the latest data from NPD Group (via CNET), Beats sold the most wireless pairs and made the most money of any audio manufacturer in the US last December — and it’s not particularly close. Despite the AirPods’ staggered rollout, Apple managed to grab 2% of unit sales and 3% of dollar sales as well. None of this should be a surprise. Beats proved years ago that having a big brand can sell expensive headphones — note the big gap between dollar sales and unit sales — and its popularity hasn’t died off since. While Apple hasn’t done much with Beats since acquiring it for $3 billion in 2014, its ownership puts it in the driver’s seat as the wireless headphone market continues to expand. And with all the new Beats cans getting the same advanced, proprietary W1 tech as the AirPods, they’ll have a distinct selling point for iPhone users going forward.

Photo / AP Tim Cook, the boss of Apple, is calling for governments to launch a public information campaign to fight the scourge of fake news, which is "killing people's minds." In an impassioned plea, Mr Cook, boss of the world's largest company, says that the epidemic of false reports "is a big problem in a lot of the world" and necessitates a crackdown by the authorities and technology firms. In an exclusive interview with The Daily Telegraph, he calls for a campaign similar to those that changed attitudes on the environment to educate the public on the threat posed by fabricated online stories. "It has to be ingrained in the schools, it has to be ingrained in the public", said Mr Cook. "There has to be a massive campaign. We have to think through every demographic. "We need the modern version of a public service announcement campaign. It can be done quickly if there is a will." The rise of fake news was being driven by unscrupulous firms determined to attract online readers at any cost, he said. "We are going through this period of time right here where unfortunately some of the people that are winning are the people that spend their time trying to get the most clicks, not tell the most truth," he said. "It's killing people's minds in a way." Tech firms, which have been criticised for doing too little, also need to up their game, he said. "All of us technology companies need to create some tools that help diminish the volume of fake news. Continued below.

Too many of us are just in the complain category right now and haven't figured out what to do." He said that this crackdown would help providers of quality journalism and help drive out clickbait. "The outcome of that is that truthful, reliable, non-sensational, deep news outlets will win," Mr Cook said. "The [rise of fake news] is a short-term thing, I don't believe that people want that at the end of the day." A new approach was required in schools, he said. "It's almost as if a new course is required for the modern kid, for the digital kid." But he is optimistic. "In some ways kids will be the easiest to educate. At least before a certain age, they are very much in listen and understand [mode], and they then push their parents to act. We saw this with environmental issues: kids learning at school and coming home and saying why do you have this plastic bottle? Why are you throwing it away?"

Image: EPA By Raymond Wong2017-02-11 01:40:00 UTC It's no secret Apple CEO Tim Cook is bullish on augmented reality. He has shared his belief that AR, and not VR, has the potential to change the world. In a new interview with The Independent, Cook reiterated his optimism on augmented reality's future, even going as far to say it's a "big idea like the smartphone." SEE ALSO: Future iPhones and iPads could have stretchy screens "The smartphone is for everyone, we don't have to think the iPhone is about a certain demographic, or country or vertical market: it’s for everyone," Cook said. "I think AR is that big, it’s huge. I get excited because of the things that could be done that could improve a lot of lives. And be entertaining." Cook said he thinks of AR as a "core technology" and not a single product — which, depending on how you want to interpret it, could mean the company's not looking to launch a pair of AR smart glasses, contrary to a claim from AR/VR evangelist Robert Scoble. "AR allows individuals to be present in the world but hopefully allows an improvement on what's happening presently." As a "core technology" Apple could implement AR more broadly across its products rather than tie it down to a single device. But despite his excitement for it, Cook thinks existing AR technology isn't ready yet, saying "there are things to discover before that technology is good enough for the mainstream." Cook also dissed VR again. "I’m excited about augmented reality because unlike virtual reality which closes the world out, AR allows individuals to be present in the world but hopefully allows an improvement on what’s happening presently." "Most people don’t want to lock themselves out from the world for a long period of time and today you can’t do that because you get sick from it. With AR you can, not be engrossed in something, but have it be a part of your world, of your conversation. That has resonance." Ouch. I guess Mark Zuckerberg won't be inviting Cook to try out the latest Oculus Rift VR tech anytime soon.

Elyse Betters10 February 2017Phones Pocket-lint Facebook Twitter Pintrest LinkedIn Google+ Mail Comment Apple's Siri has bright waves. Microsoft's Cortana has a circle. Amazon's Alexa has an A. Google Assistant has colourful bars. But what will Samsung's Bixby have? Thanks to several reports, we know that Samsung is planning to make a new AI assistant a major part of its next flagship Galaxy S8 phone and maybe even smart home strategy. There has been plenty of speculation about its features, which you can read about from here, and that it will be called Bixby. Details on the assistant are scarce. Nevertheless, a new report claims to reveal how Bixby's logo might look.  European Trade Mark Neowin spotted a Samsung trademark application filed with the European Trade Mark and Design Network. It's for a “B” logo that may end up being the logo used for the Bixby AI. The filing explained that the logo is for “interactive computer software enabling exchange of information”, meaning an assistant. However, Neowin noted the logo appears similar to "8", which might mirror the Galaxy S8's branding. Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus: What's the story so far? The Galaxy S8 is expected to be released in March. If so, prepare to see Bixby unveiled around then too.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it President Trump signs an executive order withdrawing the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership. (Ron Sachs/Bloomberg) By George F. Will By George F. Will Opinion writer February 10 at 8:01 PM Follow @georgewill At their post-Civil War apogee, 19th-century Republicans were the party of activist government, using protectionism to pick commercial winners and promising wondrous benefits from government’s deft interventions in economic life. Today, a Republican administration promises that wisely wielded Washington power can rearrange commercial activities in ways superior to those produced by private-sector calculations in free market transactions. According to the Financial Times, which interviewed him, Peter Navarro, head of the president’s National Trade Council, indicated an administration priority is “unwinding and repatriating the international supply chains on which many U.S. multinational companies rely.” This will make life interesting for, among many others, America’s third and 24th largest corporations, Apple and Boeing, respectively. The tiny print on the back of iPhones accurately says it is “assembled,” not manufactured, in China. The American Enterprise Institute’s James Pethokoukis notes that parts come from South Korea, Japan, Italy, Taiwan, Germany and the United States. Components of Boeing airliners’ wings come from Japan, South Korea and Australia; horizontal stabilizers and center fuselages from Italy; cargo access doors from Sweden; passenger entry doors from France; landing-gear doors from Canada; engines and landing gear from Britain. Navarro’s “unwinding and repatriating” is, to say no more, part of an improbable project: making America greater by making Apple, Boeing and many other corporations much less efficient and less competitive. This will further slow economic growth, making even more unattainable the 4 percent (more than double the economy’s average growth this century) or higher growth that the administration says will enable it to spend $1 trillion on infrastructure (including a $15 billion or so wall on the Mexican border, begun after nearly a decade of net negative immigration from Mexico), while substantially increasing military spending, leaving entitlements unreformed and delivering enormous tax cuts. Cuts that, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (whose co-chairs include Republican Mitch Daniels and Democrat Leon Panetta, both former directors of the Office of Management and Budget ), will reduce revenues by $5.8 trillion over 10 years. This, as the Congressional Budget Office projects that even without any of the administration’s proposed spending spree and tax cuts, under current law the national debt would increase by $9.4 trillion. Speaking of supply chains: In her book “The Travels of a T-Shirt in the Global Economy,” Georgetown University’s Pietra Rivoli recounts a conversation with a man from Shanghai who said that if she would come to China he would help her see various places involved in producing the inexpensive T-shirts exported to the United States. She would see where the yarn is spun, the fabric is knit and the shirts are sewn. Asked if she could see where the cotton is grown, the man from China said he could not show her that because the cotton probably is grown in “Teksa.” Rivoli spun a globe around to China and asked him to point to Teksa. “He took the globe and spun it back around the other way,” Rivoli writes. “ ‘Here, I think it is grown here.’ I followed his finger. Patrick was pointing at Texas.” Today’s Republican administration promises protection against the destruction of American jobs by the Chinese, Mexicans and other foreigners. The really prolific destroyers are: Americans. As Reason’s John Tamny says, Americans streaming movies from Netflix (based in Los Gatos, Calif.) erase American jobs in movie theaters and DVD rental stores. Americans buying books from Seattle-based Amazon have caused many American bookstores to do what Borders (399 stores, 11,000 employees) did: disappear. (Jeffrey P. Bezos, founder and chief executive of Amazon, owns The Post.) Americans using San Francisco-based Uber are destroying many taxi drivers’ jobs. Evidently our protectors in the administration must believe this: The destruction of American jobs because Americans buy goods or services of some American companies rather than those of other American companies is benign. But the destruction of American jobs because Americans buy goods or services of foreign companies is intolerable. An administration confident about conducting interventions in the economy should demonstrate care when bandying numbers. But in defending the sensible idea of reducing government regulation of the financial sector, Gary Cohn, director of the president’s National Economic Council, said this would save “literally hundreds of billions of dollars of regulatory costs every year.” Former treasury secretary Lawrence Summers notes the implausibility: “Total bank profits last year were about $170 billion.” Deregulation will more than double profits? As today’s Republicans celebrate a protectionist administration that is confident that Washington’s superior wisdom can improve upon the market’s allocation of economic resources, Democrats must resent Republican plagiarism.

Apple’s long-delayed Beats X wireless earbuds launch February 10 Posted Feb 7, 2017 by Brian Heater (@bheater) 0 SHARES Next Story I, for one, welcome our new robotic roti-making overlords Just ahead of the holidays, Apple announced the further delay of its Beats X wireless earbuds, pushing their launch back to an unspecified time in February. Meantime, the company managed to get its also (if less) delayed AirPods out the door and scored some pretty solid reviews in the process. The company may have taken some wind out of the W1 chip-powered tethered buds, but now they’re finally ready for retail. Apple confirmed with us today that Beats X are set to officially arrive in a few days, hitting retail on February 10. And, just for kicks, they’ll also be available in blue and gray, in addition to the already announced black and white. The earbuds charge via Lightning and promise about eight hours of life. The cable is “Flex-Form” to better adhere to the wearer’s neck and sports a button that triggers Siri. The buds themselves also feature magnets that snap them together when hung around the neck. Like the PowerBeats3 and AirPods, the big news for iPhone users is the W1 chip, which makes for super-easy pairing with other Apple devices. Of course, the headphones are compatible with non-Apple phones as well, but to less impressive effect. They’re hitting Apple’s stores and site priced at $150. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Beats Electronics Founded 2006 Overview Established in 2006 as the brainchild of legendary artist and producer Dr. Dre and Chairman of Interscope Geffen A&M Records Jimmy Iovine, Beats Electronics provides a premium sound experience at every touch point of the consumer’s life.

Photograph: Matt Dunham/AP Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close Kevin Rawlinson Friday 10 February 2017 19.18 EST Last modified on Friday 10 February 2017 19.20 EST Fake news is “killing people’s minds”, Tim Cook, the head of Apple, has said. The technology boss said firms such as his own needed to create tools that would help stem the spread of falsehoods, without impinging on freedom of speech. Cook also called for governments to lead information campaigns to crack down on fake news in an interview with a British national newspaper. The scourge of falsehoods in mainstream political discourse came to the fore during recent campaigns, during which supporters of each side were accused of promoting misinformation for political gain. “We are going through this period of time right here where unfortunately some of the people that are winning are the people that spend their time trying to get the most clicks, not tell the most truth,” Cook told the Daily Telegraph. “It’s killing people’s minds, in a way.” He said: “All of us technology companies need to create some tools that help diminish the volume of fake news. We must try to squeeze this without stepping on freedom of speech and of the press, but we must also help the reader. Too many of us are just in the ‘complain’ category right now and haven’t figured out what to do.” He said that a crackdown would mean that “truthful, reliable, non-sensational, deep news outlets will win”, adding: “The [rise of fake news] is a short-term thing. I don’t believe that people want that.” While instances were seen among supporters of both sides of the recent US election battle, Donald Trump’s campaign was seen by many as a particular beneficiary of fake news reports. And the US president’s team has been caught sending aides out to insist that a huge crowd had attended his inauguration, when the evidence showed a relatively modest audience was there. Trump’s spokesman, Sean Spicer, insisted that the event had attracted “the largest audience ever to witness an inauguration” and Trump said he believed the crowd went “all the way back to the Washington Monument”. Images from the moment Trump was taking the oath showed the crowd was relatively small and went nowhere near as far back down Washington’s National Mall as the monument. Other evidence suggested a relatively small crowd in attendance. Senior aide Kellyanne Conway later characterised the Trump administration’s falsehoods as “alternative facts”. Fake anti-Trump stories during the election included one in which it was falsely claimed that he had groped the drag queen and television presenter RuPaul. Hillary Clinton was scrutinised over her claim that there was “no evidence” her emails had been hacked because the FBI director, James Comey, had concluded it was likely they had been. A study by economists at Stanford University and New York University published two months after November’s US presidential election found that in the run-up to the vote, fake anti-Clinton stories had been shared 30 million times on Facebook, while those favouring her were shared eight million times. It said: “The average American saw and remembered 0.92 pro-Trump fake news stories and 0.23 pro-Clinton fake news stories, with just over half of those who recalled seeing fake news stories believing them.” But it called into question the power of fake news reports spread on social media to alter the outcome of the election, saying that, “for fake news to have changed the outcome of the election, a single fake article would need to have had the same persuasive effect as 36 television campaign ads”. Nevertheless, Cook demanded action to decrease the reach of fake news. “We need the modern version of a public service announcement campaign. It can be done quickly, if there is a will.” He added: “It has to be ingrained in the schools, it has to be ingrained in the public. There has to be a massive campaign. We have to think through every demographic... It’s almost as if a new course is required for the modern kid, for the digital kid. “In some ways kids will be the easiest to educate. At least before a certain age, they are very much in listen and understand [mode], and they then push their parents to act. We saw this with environmental issues: kids learning at school and coming home and saying why do you have this plastic bottle? Why are you throwing it away?” More news Topics Apple Computing Tim Cook US elections 2016 US politics More… Donald Trump Donald Trump inauguration Kellyanne Conway Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Reuse this content most viewed The Guardian back to top home US politics world opinion sports soccer tech selected arts lifestyle fashion business travel environment all sections close home US politics world UK europe americas asia middle east africa australia cities development opinion sports soccer MLS NFL MLB NBA NHL soccer live scores tables competitions results fixtures clubs tech selected arts movies tv & radio music games books art & design stage classical lifestyle food health & fitness love & sex family women home & garden fashion business economics sustainable business diversity & equality in business small business travel USA europe UK skiing environment climate change wildlife energy pollution science media crosswords blog editor quick cryptic prize quiptic genius speedy everyman azed video Technology › Apple Facebook Twitter jobs guardian labs subscribe all topics all contributors solve technical issue about us contact us complaints & corrections terms & conditions privacy policy cookie policy securedrop © 2017 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Both, broadly speaking, are high-profile companies that make advanced technology. Bombardier is the barely-airborne maker of business jets and small commercial aircraft, has a market value of $5.75-billion and, by CEO Alain Bellemare’s own admission, was on the “brink of bankruptcy” in 2015. Apple is the most successful gadget company in the history of gadgetry, makes the must-have iPhone, that ingenious meld of communications, entertainment and fashion, and has a market value of almost $700-billion (U.S.) – the size of the Swiss economy.

NEW YORK – In what can only be called a Steve Jobs and Apple moment, some shareholders of social network Facebook have filed a proposal to remove Mark Zuckerberg from the company’s board of directors essentially ending his term as the company’s CEO. The proposal that seeks to remove Mark Zuckerberg was filed by members of corporate watchdog group SumOfUs who hold some stake in Facebook. According to a report in VentureBeat, nearly 333,000 people filed a petition seeking to removed Zuckerberg as chairperson of the board of directors. However, only 1,500 of 333,000 are actual shareholders, the report shows. SumOfUs claims that it is an organisation that’s committed to “curbing the growing power of corporations”. In its proposal, the organisation’s members propose that an “independent chairperson” be appointed who is able better able to “oversee the executives of the company, improve corporate governance, and set more accountable, pro-shareholder agenda.” “In our view, shareholder value is enhanced by an independent board chair who can provide a balance of power between the CEO and the board and support strong board leadership. Independent board leadership is sorely needed at Facebook following the board’s decision in 2016 to approve a new capital structure which reduced the rights of Class A shareholders without requiring a majority vote of those shareholders,” the proposal reads. It also goes on to quote Facebook’s corporate governance score in terms of risk. “Facebook’s corporate governance score as of January 23, 2017 was 10, the highest level of risk. This score is provided by Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS), an advisor to institutional investors regarding corporate governance risks of companies in their investment portfolios. ISS recommended a vote against directors Desmond-Hellman, Andreesen and Bowles at the 2016 annual meeting for their role in the creation of Class C shares, saying “the committee failed to faithfully represent the interests of the holders of Class A stock in negotiating a self-interested transaction that was brought to the board by the controlling shareholder.” Zuckerberg is the founder and CEO of Facebook and Chairperson of its board of directors. He also owns a vast portion of Facebook’s shares and SumOfUs members’ proposal is unlikely to have any impact on Facebook’s decision-making process. But this also goes to show that investors (at least some) maybe scared of Zuckerberg’s future decisions of the company.

Headphones by David Carnoy February 7, 2017 6:30 AM PST @DavidCarnoy BeatsX may be the company's best new wireless headphones CNET's David Carnoy goes hands-on with Beats' first neckband-style headphone and is impressed. by David Carnoy and John P. Falcone 1:53 Close Drag Over the last several months, I've received dozens of messages from CNET readers asking me when Beats by Dr. Dre's delayed BeatsX headphone ($150, £130, AU$200) would be available. I have a definitive answer now: Feb. 10, 2017. Yes, the highly anticipated neckband-style wireless headphone will be in Apple's retail stores globally, from Apple.com and in authorized resellers, in white and black. Beats also announced the addition of two new colors, gray and blue, which are coming soon. Enlarge Image The BeatsX will initially ship in white and black but two new colors are coming: gray and blue. Beats by Dr. Dre Beats had updated its on-ear Beats Solo3 Wireless and Beats Powersbeats3 wireless sports headphones with Apple's new custom Bluetooth chip, the W1, which is more energy-efficient and boosts battery life significantly. The $150 BeatsX, however, is a totally new model that was designed with the help of Apple engineers (reminder: Beats is owned by Apple). CNET is one of the few publications to have gotten an early look -- and listen -- to the BeatsX. I was impressed with the new headphone and thought it could be a slightly cheaper, better alternative to Apple's AirPods. It does sound better, with substantially more bass response. I should have a review sample soon and will post a full review as soon as I put it through its paces. In the meantime, you can read our full BeatsX hands-on preview here. 26 Close up with the wireless BeatsX Earphones Share your voice 0 comments Tags Apple Headphones Beats Music CNET Review BeatsX Earphones Coming later this year, the BeatsX earphones incorporate Apple's new custom Bluetooth low-energy chip, the W1, in a neckband-style design that's sports-friendly. $149.21 See it Apple All the latest Apple news, featuring developments on the iPhone, iPad, Macbooks, OS X and much more.

Phones by Jessica Dolcourt February 7, 2017 11:15 AM PST @jdolcourt My AI is smarter than your AI. That's the taunt that Samsung Galaxy S8 owners may be able to lob at Google Pixel users if the S8's rumored Bixby Assistant launches with seven or eight languages, as reported by SamMobile. Enlarge Image Samsung's Bixby AI will go after Google Assistant, Apple's Siri and Amazon Alexa for phones CNET In the Google Pixel, Assistant currently supports two languages, according to Google's website: English and German. The Google Allo app, which also uses Google Assistant and works on more phones, supports five languages: English, German, Hindi, Japanese and Portuguese. (You can still use Google's voice search/Google Now with many more languages on the Pixel phones, but the Google Assistant launch gesture turns off when you switch your primary language to, say, Spanish.) Launching its own smart AI assistant is an important move for Samsung and its future Galaxy and Note phones. The company, which strives to dominate the smartphone world against Apple's iPhone, stands to win fans if its Bixby assistant can outperform Google's Assistant, Apple's Siri and Amazon's Alexa, which will land on its first phone later this month. This isn't the first time that Samsung has tried to out-Google Google either. The company hoped to supplant Google's voice search tool with Samsung's branded S Voice app, and introduced other software services of its own. The company has largely pulled back on preloaded apps and shuttered some of the services, so it'll be interesting to see how well Bixby AI will be able to compete with more established assistants, especially in these early days of AI on phones. Samsung's 'Bixby' assistant may have its own button on Galaxy S8 Reports suggest that Samsung could reveal is own AI in the upcoming Galaxy S8 phone -- although that phone may be delayed, considering the troubles with the Note 7. by Bridget Carey 1:55 Close Drag Bixby is rumored to: Handle payments Control native apps Identify object and text through the camera app Feature its own launch button The Samsung Galaxy S8 is expected to launch March 29 and sell in mid-April.

The Oukitel U16 Max is the name of the upcoming device, and it will debut with a large 6-inch panel. We expect to see plenty of companies increase the size of their handsets over the next few years. 5.5-inches was the trend, but companies are finding new ways to increase that screen-to-body ratio. We’ll see that from Samsung and LG soon with Apple and others bringing up the rear later in 2017. We don’t know how the Oukitel U16 Max will do in the screen-to-body ratio department, but it will have a large 6-inch slab of glass. Details on the Oukitel U16 Max specifications are a bit slim although we’ve learned a few new details. The JDI produced panel will be of the 5-point variety and carries a resolution of 1,280 x 720. It also utilizes LTPS tech and will have the popular 2.5D edges. The processor will be an octa-core chip of unknown origins although you can bet the farm it will be made by MediaTek. A fingerprint scanner will also sit on the backside as expected. This one to have a large battery as well considering the size of the display and the company’s penchant for putting large batteries. While there are more questions than answers for the Oukitel U16 Max, we shouldn’t have to wait long to find out the rest of the scoop. The smartphone is expected to launch with Android 7.0 through Aliexpress in the near future and will carry an affordable price tag when it arrives.   Tags androidOukitelOukitel U16 Maxsmartphones Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Add to Google+ Add to Pinterest Post navigation Previous article Previous post: Nokia N series rumored to return in 2017 Next article Next post: Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus Dual SIM spotted ahead of release Adam Adam is a techie, who loves new gadgets and all things Westeros.

The judge said Microsoft has at least made a plausible argument that federal law muzzles its right to speak about government investigations, while not ruling on the merits of the case. "The public debate has intensified as people increasingly store their information in the cloud and on devices with significant storage capacity,” U.S. District Judge James Robart in Seattle said in Thursday’s ruling. “Government surveillance aided by service providers creates unique considerations because of the vast amount of data service providers have about their customers." Robart rejected the tech giant’s argument that the so-called sneak-and-peek searches amount to an unlawful search and seizure of property. Former Attorney General Loretta Lynch had argued that federal law allows the Justice Department to obtain electronic communications without disclosure of a specific warrant if it would endanger an individual or an investigation. Robart, a 2004 appointee of Republican President George W. Bush, has already riled President Donald Trump this month by halting a temporary ban on visitors, immigrants and refugees from seven mostly Muslim countries. Trump labeled Robart a “so-called judge” and called his ruling in that case “ridiculous.” Escalating Feud Microsoft sued the government in April, escalating a feud with the U.S. over customer privacy and the company’s ability to disclose what it’s asked to turn over to investigators. Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft drew support in the case from tech leaders including Apple Inc., Google and Amazon.com Inc., which argued the very future of mobile and cloud computing is at stake if customers can’t trust that their data will remain private. They said the federal law allowing the searches goes “far beyond any necessary limits” and infringes users’ fundamental rights. “We’re pleased this ruling enables our case to move forward toward a reasonable solution that works for law enforcement and ensures secrecy is used only when necessary,” Brad Smith, Microsoft’s chief legal officer, said in a statement. A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment on the ruling while the department reviews it.

Fourth Amendment In the portion of Thursday’s ruling that sided with the government, the judge said he could not reconcile the company’s attempt to assert the Fourth Amendment protection against invasive searches on behalf of its customers with earlier court decisions. Other courts have found that such rights can only be asserted by individuals, and not vicariously by third parties, he said. Still, Robart recognized that the law used by the government to block Microsoft from informing users about searches “means customers whose accounts have been accessed by the government may never know of the search.” Exclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology. Sign Up Secrecy orders on government warrants for access to private e-mail accounts generally prohibit Microsoft from telling customers about the requests for lengthy or even unlimited periods, the company said when it sued. At the time, federal courts had issued almost 2,600 secrecy orders to Microsoft alone, and more than two-thirds had no fixed end date. In those cases, the company can never tell customers about government searches, even after an investigation is completed. The industry’s push against government intrusion into their customers’ private information began in the wake of Edward Snowden’s 2013 disclosures about covert-data collection that put internet companies on the defensive. Microsoft concedes that there may be times when the government is justified in seeking a gag order to prevent customers under investigation from tampering with evidence or harming another person. Still, the company contends the statute authorizing the gag orders is too broad and sets too low of a standard for secrecy. The case is Microsoft Corp. v. U.S. Department of Justice, 16-cv-00538, U.S. District Court, Western District of Washington (Seattle). Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

 Microsoft donated $250,000 to Trump's inauguration before the immigration ban Shona Ghosh Feb. 8, 2017, 4:38 AM 2,165 facebook linkedin twitter email print Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella. ANDREW HARRER / BLOOMBERG VIA GETTY Microsoft donated $250,000 (£200,000) in cash and a similar amount in services to President Trump's inauguration, according to a report by Politico. Google and Amazon also donated an undisclosed amount and technical services, despite all three now publicly decrying Trump's immigration ban. Microsoft made its contribution on December 28, according to federal ethics filings found by Politico. Google provided a YouTube livestream of the event and an unspecified donation. Amazon also donated. Facebook did not hand over any money, but did provide Instagram photo booths and a "mini Oval Office". (According to earlier reports, Facebook built mini Oval Offices for both parties' national conventions.) Uber and Twitter told Politico they did not donate to the inauguration. Apple has yet to comment, but explicitly bowed out of participating in the Republican National Convention, pointing to Trump's controversial remarks about women and minorities. More tech firms may emerge if they donated after December 31, the cutoff date for the inauguration to file its most recent set of fundraising reports. The disclosures highlight Silicon Valley's precarious relationship with President Trump. Some of its most high-profile executives, including Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg and Apple CEO Tim Cook, met with Trump shortly after his inauguration. Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk sits on Trump's business advisory council, though he has spent the last two weeks fending off criticism on Twitter. But Trump's executive order temporarily banning refugees and immigrants from 7 Muslim-majority countries sparked protests among the Silicon Valley rank and file. Microsoft CEO Satya Natella said there was no room for "bigotry", and the company described the move as "backwards". Google cofounder Sergey Brin said he was "outraged" by the order at a rally, while a group of Facebook employees said they would boycott flying. More than 100 tech companies, including those listed above, also filed an amicus brief last week opposing President Trump's travel ban.

With President Trump moving to curb immigration and the U.S. tech industry in open revolt, the friendly, functional Canadian city may finally get its wish. Tech companies that keep satellite offices in Vancouver, just a two-hour flight from San Francisco, are exploring whether to move more jobs over the border. Immigration lawyers are reporting a steep uptick in inquiries. And a new start-up is offering to smooth the way, for $6,000 a person, for foreign-born tech workers worried their U.S. visas may disappear. "The global implications are dire," said Vancouver Mayor Gregor Robertson of the unrest in the United States. "But it may result in more workers coming to Vancouver to be part of the boom here in a city that welcomes immigrants with open arms." Vancouver is not the only foreign city part of these conversations. Portuguese officials in Lisbon created a fast track for Indian entrepreneurs last month. Intercom, an Irish technology start-up, offered to pay the legal costs of developers who had been impacted by Trump's immigration policies if they would move to Ireland. Tech executives say their first choice remains overturning or softening Trump's temporary ban on travelers from seven majority-Muslim countries as well as a reported plan to cut back the numbers of new work visas. But there is an open search for other options as companies long reliant on highly skilled foreigners move to protect their access to those workers. In interviews, entrepreneurs and venture capitalists said it was ironic that a business-friendly president would inflict damage on one of the nation's most lucrative industries. "If you're a technologist, then San Francisco right now is Florence in the Renaissance," said Matthew Prince, chief executive of Cloudflare, a tech company with 400 employees, mostly in San Francisco. "Unfortunately, if we make it harder to bring the best employees here, that runs the risk of changing the center of gravity. And I don't think that's in the best interests of this country." For the talent-obsessed Silicon Valley, where an estimated one-third of the workforce is foreign-born and people are acutely aware of the fleeting nature of the success, these are much-feared outcomes. In a coordinated move opposing the ban, about 100 technology companies, including Google, Facebook, Netflix and Apple, argued in a legal filing Sunday night that restricting immigration damages U.S. competitiveness. "Instability and uncertainty" caused by the executive orders "will make it far more difficult and expensive for U.S. companies to hire some of the world's best talent - and impede them from competing in the global marketplace," the companies wrote. Yan-David Erlich, chief executive of Parsable, a 30-person start-up, was on a trip to Mexico with several colleagues last month when Trump announced his travel ban, which has since been tied up in legal challenges. Erlich — an immigrant from France, where his parents moved after fleeing the Holocaust — said he felt like the United States had changed during the few days he was away. One-third of his workforce is comprised of immigrants, and to make matters worse, two workers were carefully questioned at the airport upon their return from Mexico. One of the few bright spots, Erlich said, was that Parsable already had an office in Vancouver and could easily expand it. "We didn't create that office as a backup plan," said Erlich, 38, adding that he opened it last year to bypass a slow and burdensome U.S. visa process. "We wanted to access worldwide talent, and frankly that is easier to do in Canada than in the U.S. But now we have U.S.-based employees who see it as a safe haven." Vancouver, which already has 75,000 tech jobs and one-third of its office space devoted to the industry, has certain unmistakable advantages: It shares a time zone, a similar culture and easy travel links to U.S. tech hubs, with Seattle less than 150 miles away. Vancouver also offers access to skiing, hiking and boating - a combination popular with tech workers in the San Francisco Bay Area and Pacific Northwest. But Vancouver also has drawbacks: Housing is even more expensive than San Francisco. The Canadian city also lacks a sizable ecosystem of venture capitalists that entrepreneurs rely on to back their ideas. Canadian entrepreneur Michael Tippett teamed up with Silicon Valley venture capitalists to launch True North Ventures, a program to help Bay Area immigrants relocate to Canada. The company will fly high-skilled visa holders to Canada for an exploratory trip and meetings with local immigration lawyers, Tippett said. He also will help Silicon Valley companies set up Vancouver subsidiaries to which they can transfer employees. Since announcing the initiative last week, which was in the works prior to the announcement of Trump's travel ban, Tippett said he has fielded more than 100 calls from Silicon Valley workers on temporary H1-B work visas and from the companies that rely on them. "The Trump administration says it is pro-business, but it's our business that will benefit," Tippett said. "This is Vancouver first!" Richard Kurland, a Vancouver immigration lawyer, said he has fielded dozens of calls and emails from potential immigrants since the announcement of Trump's travel ban. "These are people voting with their feet," he said. Some immigrant entrepreneurs said they were agonizing over the decision to make a Canada move. Baback Elmieh, 42, a serial entrepreneur and Iranian immigrant who, in the past decade, sold tech companies he founded to Google and Facebook, said he would hesitate to start another company in the United States and is considering moving to Vancouver. As a legal permanent U.S. resident — but not a citizen — Elmieh has lived in Silicon Valley since he was 24 and has a 6-year-old daughter there. His parents, who also were born in Iran but now live in Canada, were forced to cancel a scheduled visit because Trump's temporary travel ban prevented them from boarding the flight. "It now feels like there are people on one side of the line and people on the other," Elmieh said. "That makes it very uncertain for what we should do for our family and where I want my daughter to grow up."

NEA co-founder Dick Kramlich launches new $130M Green Bay Ventures fund Posted Feb 7, 2017 by Matthew Lynley (@mattlynley) 0 SHARES Next Story Google debuts Cloud Search, a smart search engine for G Suite customers Dick Kramlich, the co-founder of NEA, is launching a new $130 million early-stage fund called Green Bay Ventures with partner Anthony Schiller. The fund is geared toward companies Series B and down, focusing on applied artificial intelligence in areas like manufacturing, energy, transportation and logistics, a source tells us. The fund was disclosed in a regulatory filing, and the firm declined to comment. Kramlich was an early investor in Apple along with several other high-profile companies through NEA. Related Articles Amazon Payments nearly doubled transaction volume in 2016, added 10 million more customers ClearMotion lands $100M to swap software for car shocks and boost self-driving UX GM's new SDK for in-car infotainment apps offers access to nearly 400 data points RadPad gets acquired by LandlordStation after nearly shutting down The fund will largely take a similar philosophy to NEA, making early bets on founders. Other than that, details are pretty sparse. But it seems pretty clear that with Kramlich’s history in Silicon Valley, he’ll attract wide interest from potential LPs. A source told us that the LPs include “very successful families that basically span generations from all over the world,” all of which have extensive connections in the industries the fund is targeting. This comes at a time when there has been a distinct lack of technology IPOs, with AppDynamics’ IPO essentially being pulled in favor of selling to Cisco. Snap is expected to go public next month, and it’ll be the first tech IPO of the year — and one of the largest in recent memory. Venture funds naturally play the very long game, so Kramlich may have been able to assemble a batch of LPs that are betting that the market may heat up a little bit in later years.

Laptops by Matt Elliott February 7, 2017 6:00 AM PST @themattelliott Upgrade your MacBook with an SSD Replacing your MacBook's hard drive with an SSD can give you a huge performance boost. Check out these simple steps to make your laptop feel almost new again. by Sharon Profis 4:29 Close Drag The only place I like seeing a beach ball is at a beach or in a stadium during a baseball game or concert. The one place I least like to see a beach ball is on my aging MacBook Pro, where the spinning beach ball has become an altogether too familiar a sight. If your Mac has become frustratingly slow, there are a number of ways you can speed it up again. Before you engage in any maintenance, I would urge you to take caution and back up your data. For Macs, it's easy: grab an external drive and run Time Machine. With your Mac's drive freshly backed up, you may proceed. 1. Replace your Mac hard drive with an SSD Moving from a traditional spinning hard drive to a solid-state drive (SSD) is the single best thing you can do to improve the performance of an aging MacBook. Follow Sharon Profis's instructions on how to upgrade your MacBook Pro with an SSD. You'll be shocked at not only how easy it is to do but also at the huge impact it has on performance. 17 Upgrade your MacBook to an SSD (pictures) I just performed the maneuver myself, replacing my 2011-era MacBook Pro's 500GB hard drive with the 500GB Samsung 850 EVO . The Samsung SSD and a SATA-to-USB cable kit cost me just north of $200 on Amazon. And the whole procedure took less than an hour (not counting the half a day it took to clone my MacBook's hard drive to the SSD). Really, the hardest part of the whole thing was tracking down a size 6T torx-head screwdriver for the four torx screws that help hold the hard drive in place. 2. Add more memory (RAM) While you have your MacBook opened to replace its hard drive, take the opportunity to add more memory. Like the replacing a hard drive, adding more memory is a straightforward, simple process. First, you need to find the right type of memory for your specific MacBook model. The brand doesn't matter much, just be sure to buy the right amount, type, and speed. Apple has a handy support page that shows the memory specifications for a variety of models, along with an illustrated guide to replacing the memory. In my case, my early-2011 MacBook Pro has two DIMM slots, each of which is occupied by a 2GB module. Since I don't have any free slots, I will need to replace those two modules with two 4GB modules. I need DDR3 memory with a speed of 1,333MHz. After finding the right RAM for your MacBook, follow the photos below to install the new memory. 6 Add more RAM to your MacBook Pro (photos) 3. Clean your Mac's hard drive Sometimes, all your MacBook needs is a data clean-up. Over the years, you've probably cluttered your Mac with files and applications you no longer use or need. Uninstall old Mac apps To get started, let's look in the Applications and Downloads folders. If there are apps in there you can't remember installing, odds are you can live without them. Move them to the Trash to reclaim some hard-drive space. There are files associated with every application you install, however, and they are left behind when you simply move an application to the Trash. Since Mac OS X doesn't have a built-in uninstaller, AppZapper can uninstall apps and the related files. It's free for the first five zaps, after which you'll need to pay $12.95. Clean up applications you still use Next, let's clean up the applications you are keeping. When you install an app on your Mac, the piece of software arrives as part of a package of files, including permissions that tell OS X which users can do what things with specific files. Over time, these permissions can get changed, resulting in your Mac lagging, freezing or crashing. Repairing these disk permissions, in the most basic terms, amounts to reshuffling and re-dealing these permissions so that they return to their rightful place. To address this, OS X has a built-in tool called Disk Utility that does just the trick. Read my previous post on how to repair disk permissions for a step-by-step guide. Screenshot by Matt Elliott/CNET Find out which apps are using the most resources If your Mac acts like it needs a nap every afternoon, when you are at the height of multitasking, there is an easy way to see which of your open applications is using the most system resources. Open the Activity Monitor. The numbers are constantly fluctuating, but they show you the amount of CPU and memory resources each app is using. After watching the Activity Monitor for a while this morning, I see that Firefox generally takes up more CPU resources and more than triple the memory resources. Perhaps it's time for me to abandon Firefox and use Chrome exclusively. Also, I found that the sluggish iTunes isn't nearly the resource hog I thought it was. My apologies, iTunes. Delete big, unused files Now that you've paid some attention to your applications, it's time to look at the files cluttering your drive. You can use Finder to search for huge files. To do so, open Finder and select the volume you'd like to search. Next, choose File > Find (or hit Command-F). Click on the Kind pull-down menu and select Other. When the Select a search attribute window opens, check the box for File Size, uncheck any other boxes, and click OK. Change the "equals" pull-down menu option to "is greater than" and then change KB to MB. Enter a minimum files file size such as, say, 100MB. You can then delete any files that show up on the list that you no longer need -- or move them to an external drive at the very least. 4. Reduce login items If your Mac is slow to boot up, the problem may be that there are too applications to open at startup. It's likely you never set them to launch at startup -- they launch by default. Go to System Preferences > Users & Groups and then click on the Login Items tab to see a list of the apps that open when you boot your Mac. Highlight the apps you don't want to open at startup and click the minus-sign button below the list of apps. Screenshot by Matt Elliott/CNET 5. Keep current with OS X Apple releases new versions of OS X as free upgrades, so there is no reason not to stay current. New versions of OS X contain performance enhancements and security improvements to keep your Mac running smoothly and safely. Check in periodically with the Updates tab of the Mac App Store for OS X updates, and don't ignore notifications of updates that are ready to install.

 One question from Warren Buffett made Bill Gates completely rethink Microsoft Chris Weller Feb. 7, 2017, 11:47 AM 83,703 facebook linkedin twitter email print Warren Buffett and Bill Gates. YouTube A small tech company launched in Albuquerque, New Mexico, might never have become Microsoft, the global giant, if not for a question Warren Buffett posed to Bill Gates in the early 1990s. In a January conversation between the billionaire philanthropists to celebrate 25 years of friendship, moderator Charlie Rose asked each what surprised him the most about the other. Gates eagerly fielded the question. "One of the first questions he asked me was, 'Hey, Microsoft is a small company, IBM is this huge company, why can you do better? Why can't they beat you at the software game that you're playing?'" Gates told the audience at Columbia University. That was in the early 1990s, several years before Microsoft hit its peak as the largest company on the planet. (Adjusted for inflation, the company's 1999 valuation of $613 billion eclipsed Apple's market value in 2014 by about $200 billion.) Throughout those early years, Gates and his cofounder, Paul Allen, spent much of their time thinking about how to make the software as good as it could be. No one had really thought to focus on gaining a competitive edge in the market. Gates started incorporating the idea into his thought process. "Every day I was thinking about, 'OK, what advantage do we have? What do we do?'" he said. Throughout most of the 1990s, Microsoft gained its edge over competitors through easy-to-use interfaces in home computers, notably with its Windows operating system. It began tapping into a base of nontechnical customers that other companies largely ignored. And by 1995, Gates alerted Microsoft employees to the incoming "internet tidal wave," as his internal memo dubbed it, setting the company on course to dominate how people would surf the web for years to come. He and Buffett, a businessman 25 years Gates' senior, also began talking more about the ways finance related to the technology industry Gates was building with Microsoft. "I didn't understand banking — why some get ahead and some don't," Gates said. "And so I found somebody whose model was rich enough that it helped me understand things that I really wanted to know, and we could laugh about things that were a surprise to us." Even today, Gates said, his relationship with Buffett is built on curiosity — though Gates is often the one doing the probing. "I'd say his humility and his sense of humor really stood out in this incredible way," Gates said. "I mean, he enjoys what he does, and he shares that with other people. And even when I ask questions that are pretty naive that he's probably been asked 50 times, he's very nice about it."

Only this time, the leaked image showed the words "Samsung Galaxy S8+". If anything, the tweet leaked information of a larger Galaxy S8 model which Samsung could name as the S8+. The "+" branding is very important here since Apple uses the "Plus" word for its iPhone devices. But despite this leaked image of the Galaxy S8+'s branding, Samsung has not announced anything official about the device. So far, all we know (based on the rumors) is that there could be a Galaxy S8 with a 5.7-inch screen and a larger 6-inch screen for the Galaxy S8+. There are also reports indicating that Samsung could be moving the home button from the front to the back of the device, just like what Huawei did on the P9 model. Both devices are also rumored to run on Snapdragon 835 processors with 8GB of RAM. With all the rave about dual-cameras, we might also expect to see these included on Samsung's upcoming devices this year. As for the battery-size, there are rumors circulating that Samsung could be including a 3,000 mAh battery on the Galaxy S8 and a larger 3,500 mAh battery on the S8+; a battery similar to the ill-fated Note 7. Prior to this report, there were reports that said Samsung will be including a voice-powered virtual assistant called Bixby. When it launches, it will be the next competitor of Google Now and Apple's Siri. Again, these are all speculation and rumors. Nothing has been officially announced by Samsung. We'll know the real score behind the Galaxy S8 and S8+ when it launches. If the rumors are true, the two devices could be announced at an NYC event to be held on March 29th.   Source:  EVLeaks Samsung Android Leak Samsung Galaxy S8+ Samsung Galaxy S8 Rumor Samsung Galaxy S8 Samsung Galaxy S8+ Rumor Samsung Next ArticleAre you ready to say goodbye to bezels?

The bulls may have been firmly in charge of the market on Friday, inspired by a strong employment report for January. As has been the case so many times since December though, the rally lacked follow-through. The S&P 500’s close of 2,292.56 yesterday was 4.86 points down from, or 0.21% below, Friday’s last trade. And that was more or less the story for the Nasdaq Composite and the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The Nasdaq fell 3.21 points to end the session at 5,663.55, while the Dow slumped 19.04 points, or 0.09%., to close at 20,052.42. None of the major indices made their way into new-high territory, though all of them remain within striking distance of record-high levels. Energy stocks were the day’s big loser, giving up 0.9% even though crude oil eked out a gain of 0.36% on Monday, to close at $53.20 per barrel; investors were more concerned about the dollar’s strength and what it may mean for oil stocks. Schlumberger Limited (NYSE:SLB) did the most damage, with a 1% stumble. At the other end of the spectrum, technology stocks finished the session with a tiny gain of 0.1%. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) carried the weight there, with a 1% gain of its own. The weakness was broad too. For the NYSE, 59% of its listings lost ground, and 37% advanced The Nasdaq’s breadth was similarly bearish, with 60% of its issues losing ground versus 35% of them rising on Monday. Even so, depth — selling volume — was modest. The NYSE’s total trade was only 3.11 billion shares, down a bit from Friday’s action. The NYSE’s and the Nasdaq’s bullish/bearish volume ratios essentially mirrored both indices’ advancer/decliner ratios. Still, a handful of names overcame marketwide weakness. Hasbro, Inc. (NASDAQ:HAS) was one them. Shares of the toymaker jumped 14% following the company’s fourth quarter earnings report that topped expectations. The overall market remains in its tepidly bullish mode, framed as much by horizontal boundaries as it is by rising lows and rising highs. For the S&P 500, that horizontal floor is at 2253. More recently though, the index has found support at a modestly meaningful rising support level, and it remains above the 20-day moving average line. To start the next leg of bullishness though, the S&P 500 will need to clear the 2,301 ceiling where it peaked two weeks ago. Click to Enlarge The Nasdaq Composite is also knocking on the door of a breakout. Monday’s high of 5,668 is right below the high from two weeks ago. Click to Enlarge While momentum is bullish, there’s no denying stocks are technically overextended and struggling to tack on more gains with any amount of consistency. The S&P 500 is now 6% above the 200-day moving average line after having rallied 10% since the early November low. That’s a tough act to follow, particularly this time of year. February is generally a tough month, and even tougher when it’s the first February of a four-year Presidential term. The S&P 500 essentially breaks even this month (and then only because it finishes strong following a mid-month lull), and when it’s the year after an election, February averages a 1.6% loss. Still, until the indices actually start to break under key technical levels, the undertow has to be considered bullish even if valuations are reaching uncomfortable levels again. The S&P 500 is now valued at a trailing P/E of 21.2. That doesn’t leave much room for gains, which is why they’ve been so slow-going of late.

Apple makes a killing on its iPhones by not including expandable storage. This way, users have no choice but to spend more money on higher-margin iPhone models if they want more space to store photos, videos and music. There’s another option out there, however: you can buy an iPhone flash drive or a microSD card reader. But instead of having yet another thing to carry around, kill two birds with one stone and pick up a GHB USB Memory Card Reader/Lightning Cable.

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Saturday, 11 February 2017 Omnicom quarterly revenue misses estimate OMNICOM Group Inc, the No. 1 US advertising company, reported lower-than-expected quarterly revenue due to a strong dollar, following prominent political events such as Brexit and the US presidential election. Revenue, for the company which is one of the “big four” ad agencies, rose 2.1% to US$4.24bil, but missed analysts’ average estimate of US$4.26bil, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. New York-based Omnicom, whose clients include Apple Inc, Procter & Gamble, McDonald’s Corp and Adidas, said negative impact of foreign exchange rates reduced revenue in the fourth quarter by 1.8%. The dollar had risen 6.8% against a basket of major currencies in the quarter ended Dec 31. The company did not break up revenue by geography in its quarterly report. However, according to Thomson Reuters data, about 38% of Omnicom’s total revenue in 2015 came from outside the Americas region. Omnicom said organic revenue in North America rose 0.6% in the latest quarter. Subsidiaries of Omnicom and fellow competitor Publicis Groupe SA were subpoenaed by the US Department of Justice in December, as part of an investigation whether ad agencies had rigged bids to favor in-house production units. Rival Interpublic Group of Cos Inc earlier in December said that one of its domestic agencies had been contacted by the DoJ as part of the investigation. Advertising companies have been exploring new revenue streams and are trying to keep up with clients’ increasing demand for video content. The company's net income rose to US$348.7mil, or US$1.47 per share, in the latest quarter, from US$328.3mil, or US$1.35 per share, a year earlier. Analysts. on average. were expecting earnings of US$1.44 per share. – Reuters Tags / Keywords: Advertising & Media , Omnicom Related Stories Top US ad group Omnicom’s Q4 revenue misses estimate Omnicom appoints Shyam as head of digital OMG CEO wins leadership award Omnicom-Publicis merger off Omnicom-Publicis merger hits roadblock You May Be Interested Kuehner tasked with refreshing Celcom brand Ford to invest $1 bln in autonomous vehicle tech firm Argo AI MAS brings unity to new heights Mah Sing on transformation mode Reserves up, ringgit underperforms Experiencing painful menses?

Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 11 February 2017 by Military News SHAREHOLDER ALERT: Pomerantz Law Firm Reminds Shareholders with Losses on their Investment in Qualcomm Incorporated of Class Action Lawsuit and Upcoming Deadline – QCOM NEW YORK, Feb. 10, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Pomerantz LLP announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against Qualcomm Incorporated (“Qualcomm” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ:QCOM) and certain of its officers.   The class action, filed in United States District Court, Southern District of California, is on behalf of a class consisting of investors who purchased or otherwise acquired Qualcomm securities, seeking to recover compensable damages caused by defendants’ violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. If you are a shareholder who purchased Qualcomm securities between February 1, 2012 and January 19, 2017, both dates inclusive, you have until March 24, 2017 to ask the Court to appoint you as Lead Plaintiff for the class.  A copy of the Complaint can be obtained at www.pomerantzlaw.com.   To discuss this action, contact Robert S. Willoughby at rswilloughby@pomlaw.com or 888.476.6529 (or 888.4-POMLAW), toll free, ext. 9980. Those who inquire by e-mail are encouraged to include their mailing address, telephone number, and number of shares purchased.  [Click here to join this class action] Qualcomm is a global semiconductor company that develops, designs, licenses, and markets worldwide its digital communications products and services, primarily through its two main business segments: Qualcomm CDMA Technologies and Qualcomm Technology Licensing. The Complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects.  Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that:  (i) Qualcomm engaged in anticompetitive conduct to maintain a monopoly for semiconductors used in mobile phones in violation of federal law; (ii) in turn, Qualcomm lacked effective internal controls over financial reporting; and (iii) as a result, Qualcomm’s public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. On December 28, 2016, the South Korean Fair Trade Commission fined Qualcomm a record $853 million for violating antitrust laws. After a three-year investigation, the Korean antitrust regulator found that Qualcomm breached antitrust law by limiting competing chip makers’ access to its patents. It also found that the Company forced mobile-phone manufacturers into unfair license agreements by refusing to supply critical phone chips to those that would not accept Qualcomm’s terms. On this news, Qualcomm’s share price fell $1.50, or 2.23%, to close at $65.75 on December 28, 2017. On January 17, 2017, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission commenced an enforcement action against Qualcomm following an investigation of the Company’s licensing practices.  The agency’s complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, said that Qualcomm used its dominant position to maintain an illegal monopoly in the market for mobile phone chips. On this news, Qualcomm’s share price fell $2.69, or 4.02%, to close at $64.19 on January 17, 2017. On January 20, 2017, The Wall Street Journal reported that tech-giant Apple Inc. was suing Qualcomm, alleging that the Company “leveraged its monopoly position as a manufacturer of baseband chips, a critical component used in cellphones, to seek ‘onerous, unreasonable and costly’ terms for patents, and that Qualcomm blocked Apple’s ability to choose another supplier for chipsets.”  The article further reported that Apple was seeking $1 billion in rebate payments that Qualcomm allegedly withheld as retribution for Apple’s involvement in an investigation conducted by South Korea’s antitrust regulator. On this news, Qualcomm’s share price fell $1.56, or 2.42%, to close at $62.88 on January 20, 2017. The Pomerantz Firm, with offices in New York, Chicago, Florida, and Los Angeles, is acknowledged as one of the premier firms in the areas of corporate, securities, and antitrust class litigation. Founded by the late Abraham L. Pomerantz, known as the dean of the class action bar, the Pomerantz Firm pioneered the field of securities class actions. Today, more than 80 years later, the Pomerantz Firm continues in the tradition he established, fighting for the rights of the victims of securities fraud, breaches of fiduciary duty, and corporate misconduct. The Firm has recovered numerous multimillion-dollar damages awards on behalf of class members. See www.pomerantzlaw.com

The Billikens had just lost, 70-55, to St. Bonaventure at Reilly Center in Olean, N.Y., when they were unable to locate the bus scheduled to take the team to a nearby airport. Players and coaches had stored some of their belongings on the bus already, including Ford’s iPad. One of his players suggested using the Find My iPhone app, which uses Apple’s iCloud service to locate iOS devices. Just chilling in the Reilly Center while we try to find our missing bus. #SCNotTop10 pic.twitter.com/Au9LwpofO1— SLU Men's Basketball (@SaintLouisMBB) February 9, 2017 “I don’t know any of this stuff,” Ford said at a news conference. “They said, ‘You can do it on your phone.’ I did have it and it worked. Once we found where she was on my phone, they were able to go straight to her.” New York State Police located the bus about 40 miles away from the arena. The driver, 56-year-old Linda Edmister, had a blood alcohol content of 0.22 --- nearly three times the legal limit --- and she was arrested on suspicion of operating a commercial vehicle while intoxicated.

Cook said that unlike Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality allowed individuals to be present in the world. He noted that you don't have to be engrossed in AR to have it be part of your world. I regard it as a big idea like the smartphone. The smartphone is for everyone, we don't have to think the iPhone is about a certain demographic, or country or vertical market: it’s for everyone. I think AR is that big, it’s huge. I get excited because of the things that could be done that could improve a lot of lives. And be entertaining. I view AR like I view the silicon here in my iPhone, it’s not a product per se, it’s a core technology. But there are things to discover before that technology is good enough for the mainstream. I do think there can be a lot of things that really help people out in daily life, real-life things, that’s why I get so excited about it. Recent reports have suggested that Apple is planning to integrate AR into the iPhone's Camera app which would explain why Cook has been praising the technology of late. Cook also talked to the site about his recent Europe trip, challenges that Apple faces, and more. Hit the link below for the entire interview.

Reply · Like · Mark as Spam Ohio - 4 hours ago "A big idea like the smartphone" wow. What a deep quote. He really knows how to woo the stock holders. I don't think the smartphone was really an idea. It was just a phone that had all the technology and features that people like me knew they wanted since the computer was invented before I was even born and just wanted someone to make it.. kind of like I want a flying car and when someone takes the time to make it work I'll buy it. But way easier than a flying car. Now he is riding the wave of the iPhone to try to convince people he is good. Luckily jobs took the smartphone that wasn't an idea and just made a really really nice quality phone that happens to be called smart. Jobs learned how to leverage emerging technology into near perfect products and became very talented at using technology to give people what they want and beat everyone else at it. Cook is just lost. The Watch, the VR, the self driving car.. he sure loves jumping on the bandwagon. How about he work on smart homes. That's something I know I want a LOT more of. A hell of a lot more than strapping on a headset. Reply · Like · Mark as Spam YourMotherSucksCocksInHell - 2 hours ago There a reason he's worth millions and you're worth hundreds.

"The new stay-at-home economy is precisely what scares me about these stocks that depend on people going out," the "Mad Money" host explained. Activision Blizzard, the world's largest maker of video games reported a monster quarter on Thursday, sending the stock up 18 percent on Friday. Nvidia makes gaming chips, and also reported an insanely great number. Netflix hit a 52-week high, and so did Domino's Pizza, with Amazon bouncing back behind it. Steve Cole | Getty Images The one thing that these stocks have in common is the "stay home, don't go out" theme. These are companies that thrive on people who stay home on their couches, order delivery, play games and watch TV while checking Facebook on their Apple iPhones. "This is the real enemy of retail and restaurants," Cramer said. Some can beat it, but Cramer said most cannot. Panera Bread reported strong earnings, but 25 percent of those sales came from digital, which means it was either takeout or delivery and that distinguishes them from the pack. Costco hit an all-time high, but that is because it makes its money on memberships, not on foot traffic. So whether it is time management, or making things easier to do at home, stocks like Nvidia, Apple and Netflix are all coming together to prevent people from leaving the house, and that is what is killing bricks-and-mortar, Cramer said. "You need to be very careful with this cohort because the forces against retail traffic are numerous, they are powerful, they are not going away and they can only rarely be defeated," Cramer said.

These are the top stories of the week. 1. More than 100 companies filed an amicus brief voicing opposition to President Trump’s immigration ban executive order. Among them are Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, Tesla, SpaceX, Airbnb and Twitter. The brief was tied into the case brought by the states of Minnesota and Washington. The Trump administration appealed the case to the 9th Circuit after a federal judge in Seattle halted the immigration ban, where it was then shut down.  2. The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative announced it is donating $3.6 million to fight the San Francisco Bay housing crisis. A majority of the funding will go to Community Legal Services in East Palo Alto to address current hardships caused by the housing shortage. In addition, the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, the nonprofit medical research org created by the pair, announced it is giving $50 million to 47 disease research initiatives. 3. Starting next month, the FBI will no longer accept Freedom of Information Act requests by email, and will instead require a fax or snail mail. The decision to revert to archaic tech is troubling, but for FOIA filers, another layer of obfuscation is just business as usual. However, the portal’s new terms of service will let you send an unlimited number of requests. 4. Google officially launched Android Wear 2.0, the biggest update to the company’s wearable OS since its launch in 2014. The updated version feels a lot like the next logical evolution, and the OS is launching on two new flagship watches from LG. 5. Jawbone has run out of money. The fitness band maker that originally started out in headsets and speakers will stop selling consumer hardware in favor of a new business model and manufacturing health devices. Jawbone is also trying to raise more money for this new endeavor. 6. Former Democratic campaigner John Podesta has spoken up about the WikiLeaks email hack that occurred in the final month before the 2016 election. TechCrunch spoke with him about cybersecurity, fake news and Russia. 7. Airbnb is growing. Just after the company bought payments startup Tilt for $50 million, we learned that Airbnb is also acquiring Luxury Retreats, a service that focuses on high-end homes, for a price believed to be around $200 million. 8. Just a few days after announcing Jay Fulcher as its new CEO, Zenefits laid off 45 percent of its workforce. The company said it simply had to cut costs, and is going to centralize its operations group in Arizona. 9. Mike Rothenberg, the VC who came under scrutiny after a SEC investigation and several fraud allegations, is reverting the branding of Frontier Tech Ventures back to Rothenberg Ventures. 10. Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial looks to be on the cusp of a global M&A spree. The company is reportedly close to raising nearly $3 billion in debt financing in order to bankroll more acquisitions. 11. It looks like the U.S. IPO landscape may be heating up in 2017 after all. A Chinese photo-sharing app called Kuaishou is planning to go public in the U.S. later this year. Sources tell us the Instagram-like app has more than 40 million DAU against 100 million MAU, and was recently valued at around $3 billion. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Newsletter Subscriptions The Daily Crunch Get the top tech stories of the day delivered to your inbox TC Weekly Roundup Get a weekly recap of the biggest tech stories Crunchbase Daily The latest startup funding announcements Enter Address Subscribe SEE ALL NEWSLETTERS » Latest Crunch Report Prince Returns To Spotify | Crunch Report Watch More Episodes Popular Posts Featured Stories Prince Returns To Spotify | Crunch Report VIDEO | 2:38 | Crunch Report Carl Bass on his surprising Autodesk exit — and what’s next 12 hours ago | Connie Loizos Uncorking innovation with Treasury Wine Estates in Napa 13 hours ago | Lora Kolodny Beats X bring Apple’s wireless headphone tech to a tethered form factor 15 hours ago | Brian Heater Facebook says it will open up for independent ad audit 17 hours ago | Anthony Ha Latest From TechCrunch Crunch Report: Prince returns to Spotify 8 hours ago | Anthony Ha Trump’s immigration ban is terrible for entrepreneurs 9 hours ago | Samia Bahsoun Payback’s a gift 10 hours ago | Talia Goldberg, Jeremy Levine Sen.

Panneerselvam vs Sasikala: Who will lead Jayalalithaa's party? Track the turmoil in Tamil Nadu here CHENNAI: Mobile phone and parts manufacturers are lobbying for continuity of duty conditions that led to a groundswell in electronics manufacturing since 2015 and one of the key factors for Taiwanese phone-maker Foxconn trying to take over the shuttered Nokia plant which knocked India off the phone export global map with its closure. Phone-makers have expressed concern that the latest Budget had few markers that committed to incentives for making in India. The Indian Cellular Association, which counts Apple and Google as its members, is pursuing its case with the central ministries to ensure duty advantages stay and are expanded under the GST regime. Pankaj Mohindroo, the national president of the Indian Cellular Association, however, was confident that the finance ministry would soon make up for the Budget lapses: “There has been an oversight. There are more verticals like keypads and such that need to be announced under the Phased Manufacturing Programme. We are certain it will be implemented and no one should hold back investment plans due to this lapse.” Multiple phone makers had set up factories in clusters around Noida, Uttar Pradesh, and in Andhra Pradesh and in other states after a counter-vailing duty imposed by the Centre in its 2015 Budget that made it cheaper for brands to make in India than import from China. This move was followed by with similar duty regimes for batteries, chargers, and adapters. Called the Phased Manufacturing Programme, the concept was to expand the incentive establishment to many other avenues in electronics manufacturing to touch a target of making 500 million phones, Rs 50,000 crore from the components industry and generate employment of 15 lakh workers by 2019-20. The Fast Track Task Force, set up to accelerate phone and part manufacturing in the country, had led to 35 new plants and 15 factories for components in the one year up to August last year. With the Budget 2017 showing little promise and little assurance of the Goods and Services Taxes regime perpetuating these duty incentives, the manufacturers are worried. Sasikumar Gendham, managing director of Indian subsidiary of Finnish firm Salcomp, said: “Thousands of jobs and crores have been invested with the duty differential as a key contributor. In three years, Indian manufacturers may not need them. But now, they are necessary. Many Chinese suppliers are looking at these tax conditions to invest in India,” he said. Salcomp, which runs a sole factory inside the 212-acre Nokia SEZ, is buying another factory to expand operations. Gendham said companies have begun dialogues with officials with the central government. “While they are seized of the matter, clarity is yet to emerge on how things will look under GST,” he said. The $150-billion revenue company Foxconn is amidst its second inning in the country after Nokia’s closure. The Apple phone manufacturer had expressed interest in the Nokia factory, but had laid out clear conditions, among others, that the tax liabilities that did in the factory should not be brought back to haunt Foxconn. Another industry representative with knowledge of Foxconn India operations said: “It is important that an ecosystem for not just phone makers but also suppliers to make in India. For foreign makers, a demonstrable, repeatable policy structure is required to take India seriously.” Stay on top of business news with The Economic Times App. Download it Now!

PhoneDog Android And Me TodaysiPhone NEW Call T-Mobile at (855) 668-8976 TmoNews Unofficial T-Mobile Blog, News, Videos, Articles and more Navigation Home Submit News 700MHz LTE map Upcoming Phones HOT TOPICS: Samsung Galaxy Note 7 LG V20 Google Pixel Extended Range LTE Android 7.0 Nougat You are here: Home > Samsung Galaxy S8 shows itself in new photo leak as spec details revealed, too Samsung Galaxy S8 shows itself in new photo leak as spec details revealed, too January 26, 2017 Alex Wagner 68 Comments Days after an image of the LG G6 leaked, a new photo of another upcoming Android flagship has surfaced. A new photo claims to show off both the front and back of the Samsung Galaxy S8. Specifically, this is the larger of the two models, says VentureBeat. This GS8 is said to include a 6.2-inch Quad HD Super AMOLED display with an aspect ratio of 18.5:9 and curved edges, as well as a 3500mAh battery. The smaller Galaxy S8 will reportedly include a 5.8-inch Quad HD Super AMOLED display with the same aspect ratio and curved edges as the larger model. The battery of this version will be smaller, though, measuring in at 3000mAh battery. The displays on both phones will allegedly include a touch-sensitive portion on the lower part of the display that’ll distinguish between different screen presses, similar to Apple’s 3D Touch functionality. Both phones are expected to include a 12-megapixel rear camera with a visual search feature, an 8-megapixel front camera, and an iris scanner. Because Samsung opted not to use a physical home button on the GS8, the fingerprint reader has moved to the back of the phone, next to the rear camera. Samsung will also include Bixby, its new virtual assistant that can be activated by pressing the dedicated button on the side of the phone. Bixby is said to be more advanced than some of the other digital assistants on the market, with the ability to handle multi-step instructions. Another rumored feature of the GS8 is the Samsung DeX. With this feature, you’ll be able to plug the Galaxy S8 into an HDMI dock and connect it to a monitor, keyboard, and mouse to get a desktop version of Android. Rounding out the Galaxy S8’s rumored feature set is 4GB of RAM, 64GB of storage, a microSD Slot, USB Type-C, stereo speakers, and a 3.5mm headphone jack. Samsung is reportedly planning to include a Snapdragon 835 processor in some models of the phone and an Exynos chipset in others. Samsung is going to unveil the Galaxy S8 on March 29, says today’s report. There’s no word on when the GS8 might launch in the US, but a European launch is allegedly happening on April 21, with pricing set at €799 ($854 USD) for the 5.8-inch model and €899 ($962 USD) for the larger 6.2-inch version. According to today’s report, Samsung has quite a few changes in store for the Galaxy S8. Some of those will likely be welcomed, like the inclusion of USB Type-C, but others might frustrate some folks, like the lack of a flat screen model. We’ll just have to wait until Samsung officially launches the GS8 before we know exactly how they handle and perform. What do you think of the Galaxy S8 based on today’s leak? Are you looking forward to Samsung’s next big thing? Source: VentureBeat Tags: Android, leaks, Samsung, Samsung Galaxy S8 About Alex Wagner Editorial Director of News and Content for PhoneDog Media.

IamDefiler If these are legit, I don’t like the FP reader placement at all. Michael Yeah, looks like they’re using the same location as the heart rate sensor on the Galaxy S6. Guess that’s Samsung’s way of making their phones different from the competition. ex. Google Pixel, Nexus 5x/6P, Huawei Honor 8, etc. all have their fingerprint scanner in the back center. dontsh00tmesanta Nope, trash zeiferx You have to be joking! With this bigger phones I guess the note is officially dead! The only thing that was left out was the stylus. Also that placement for the fingerprint represents like they do no surveys or get any feedback, other manufacturers use the round a middle sección because it feel natural, that placement is uncomfortable,i never used the 02 or heart rate on my galaxy phones because of it. The specs do nor surprise anyone, I would have expected at least 128 in storage and some extra ram just to make up for their note fiasco and their memory management which is a joke. Samsung is just pulling an apple. Doing the bare minimum even after a huge f up Sidekicker89 Is it just me or does that look like a micro USB port instead of a Type C? Brian Richards Yes it most definitely does, and it kind of looks photshopped on there. It’s the one spot I thought, hmmmm… is this a real pic? Aleks I think Sammy f**ked up with the finger print sensor being place in the back, right next to the camera lens. What in the world were they thinking?? Looks like a very awkward place to put it, considering most people don’t touch that area with their fingers. Samsung went 2 steps forward and took 10 steps back. Also the phone on the right seems to have the standard mini USB port and not USB Type-C. Maybe it’s just the roundness of the edges, but darn, Sammy sure messed up. Apple is certainly going to retake the lead as they have imbedded the finger print sensors right underneath the screen. COME ON SAMSUNG!!!! RAISE YOUR INNOVATION GAME UP!!!! You’ve become BASIC!!! Larry E They are all ‘basic’. Close to $1000 and no removable battery?!? So, you’ll be buying another in 2 years. The only manufacturer that tries anything different is LG & they get crucified for it. If they could fix those bootloop issues, I’d buy one in a hearbeat. Seriously considering my next phone to be an Apple. At least they have good resale value. KrisKordova A removable battery is a sign of cheapness. Your $10 basic Tracfone has a removable battery. Larry E Sad. So a Note4 is a cheap phone? By this logic, you would buy cars with non replaceable oil filters if makers just made the cars look more premium. So, I guess sheeple don’t mind spending $1000 on a phone every other year. Then, they wonder why they can’t pay off student loans or get ahead. Wayne It’s sad, how disposable phones have become the norm. I’m still on my S4 for this very reason. Michael Well with the Galaxy S6 the heart rate sensor was placed where the fingerprint reader is located in the S8 photo. Therefore I can see why Samsung would place it there instead of the center like other phones. Perhaps they didn’t want their phones looking like the competition. S6EdgePlus IsBoss You sound like a basic clown at best. squiddy20 And how exactly does he “sound like a basic clown”? What do you think is wrong with what he said? Do/are you ever going to do anything other than just spew your childish opinions and leave without backing up your side of the story? And wtf exactly is a “basic clown”? Is it different from a “complicated clown”? Is it different from an acidic clown? mreveryphone Early Prototype… S6EdgePlus IsBoss Late prototype definitely not finished product so things will still change. Like 6gb of ram in both and the fingerprint sensor will be in the glass not the back. squiddy20 Bwhahaha! Proof you have no clue what you’re talking about. All other rumors have stated the fingerprint sensor will be on the back. All rumors have stated 4 GB of RAM. And we’re supposed to believe you? Based on what? Your incredible track record of getting predicted specs wrong? Hahahahaha! Keep it up! T Redd That s6edge guy is hilarious. kev2684 Is the fingerprint scanner gonna be as scratch prone as the S7 ones? I hated that about it. TheRealKingSen If the prices are remotely accurate then I will have to pass. These so called high end phone prices are absurd Philip Did I read correctly there will not be a physical home push button anymore? Its on screen now? What a hugh setback! purenupe1 “with pricing set at €799 ($854 USD) for the 5.8-inch model and €899 ($962 USD) for the larger 6.2-inch ” Im out…. call me cheap but those prices are bonkers S6EdgePlus IsBoss Top of the line is top of the line Samsung deserves the cash for these handsets they easily will be the best android handsets on the Android platform till the Note8 and NoteFold in September. Rob Samsung doesn’t deserve anyone’s money. Both Apple and Samsung need to die. Hopefully sales continue to suffer after the Note 7 fiasco. Generally when consumers associate the words fire and explode with a brand, they tend to be leery and with price tags like that, consumers are already leery. You can buy a 55in 4K HDR TV and an Xbox One S for the rumored pricing of the 6.2in model! I think I’m going to stop with the madness and see what ZTE and OnePlus do once the 835 gets into their devices… I have an HTC 10 right now and I’m pretty happy with it but the Axon 7 and OnePlus 3T are much more attractive than the Samsung… And that’s not even factoring in their draconian encrypted bootloaders which turn me off even more. S6EdgePlus IsBoss I can only laugh at you useless bargain basement low budget handset buyers you guys are bain of technology. Samsung sold 90 million smartphones in 2016 the so called Note7 fiasco HAD NO EFFECT on Samsung’s revenue nor has it deter any current customers or future customers from the brand stop making a fool out of yourself. You’re HTC 10 is a pathetic joke on the Android platform and so is worthless HTC they’re going nowhere as usual. Step to the left my friend budget buyers buck saving Android users don’t know quality if it slapped them in the head. It’s always been pretty much plain and simple for me since March 2011. Nothing beats Samsung they are Android and technology nothing else matters period. dtam https://us.community.samsung.com/t5/Galaxy-S-Phones/S7-edge-pink-line-down-screen/td-p/11959 squiddy20 “you guys are bain of technology” Proof you not only have no clue what you’re talking about, but you can’t spell to boot (even with modern day auto correct/spell check) “Samsung sold 90 million smartphones in 2016” 1. They haven’t even released the data fro Q4 2016, so on that point alone, you’re wrong because you don’t know. 2. Between all their smartphones (the cheap ones and the expensive ones), I guarantee you Samsung sold way more than “90 million smartphones”. And you call yourself a fanboy? What a joke! “the so called Note7 fiasco HAD NO EFFECT on Samsung’s revenue” Wow. You don’t jack squat, or choose to ignore certain facts. Go ahead and google search “note 7 revenue loss” and tell me Samsung didn’t loose revenue. I’ll wait. Rob Know your roots man. HTC is the reason Android took off in the first place. It’s hard for HTC and anyone else to compete with Samsung and Apple when those two companies have everything from deep pockets to carriers in their back pockets as well. When the M8 came out, my store didn’t even put them on display. I asked them to get me one from the back, they tried to shove Samsung crap down my throat even though I was upgrading from the M7 so obviously liked the One design. The M9 was a bust and I had a Nexus 6 and a Note 5 during that time but then I jumped on the HTC 10. Here’s what I can say – HTC has made some mistakes over the years but from the days of Windows Mobile 5 to Android kicking off, they were a force to be reckoned with. Oh and my HTC 10 survived a drop from the balcony onto the tile on the first floor with just an 8 dollar TPU bumper case on it and my M7 fell from my ear while I was talking on it and rolled on its sides before coming to rest on its back because of how HTC had weighted the design – unless dropped face first, it hardly ever would actually land on its face. Don’t know why I’m getting into it with a fanboy but facts are facts. HTC makes great phones, Samsung just outshines them from advertising to carrier agreements because of their deep pockets. The truth is that Samsung has more defective products than anyone else. purenupe1 Nah bruh…they are price gouging. Their is nothing ground breaking in these specs S6EdgePlus IsBoss Budget bargain basement handset buyers would feel you’re way Samsung users are buying regardless what you think. At the end of the day Samsung is technology and Android period everything else is pretty much worthless and comically boring and obsolete. purenupe1 True….fanboys will buy (and defend) in spite of the price and and recent exploding phone debacle. But any logical consumer will compare specification vs the competition and previous models in order to determine the value for price. If my current top of the line phone is still working and no truly revolutionary changes have been added to the new model than why should i upgrade, just to keep up with the jones’s? Impulse buying like that is a common trait of broke and in debt people. And to be honest Samsung would lose a few points in my value book because i have to wonder was the Note 7 just the start of a bad Quality controls or a one off. squiddy20 Huh. Look at that. The Samsung fanboy spouting off the same regurgitated crap he’s been spewing for the past 6 years, with no further/more detailed explanation as to how or why. What a surprise. squiddy20 Is Samsung really “top of the line” though? What exactly constitutes “top of the line”? Sure, their phones have tons of features… that basically no one uses. dtam samsung quality is lacking. exploding phones, exploding washing machines, pink lines on screens. I think this s7edge will be my one and only samsung phone…at least for awhile sligvu The size of these phones are ridicules. Michael Keep in mind that we haven’t seen the size of the bezel on the phone. Without the physical home button, the bezel on the bottom of the phone would be a lot smaller, therefore even if the smaller sized S8 has a screen size of 5.8in, the overall size of the phone can still be the same as the current Galaxy S7 with the larger top and bottom bezel. Same goes for the larger 6.2in S8. S6EdgePlus IsBoss That means you’re not buying so simply step to the left. squiddy20 Explain that, if you even can. I’d love to hear how you get “I’m not buying it” from “that’s ridiculous”. Brian Richards How do you know that? We only have the screen diagonal right? The ratio is now 18.5:9 so that just means a longer screen with therefor a longer diagonal. It doesn’t translate into a wider phone necessarily. Or even a longer phone since there’s no home button. Stefan Naumowicz The same width but longer is still bigger Brian Richards Bit only the screen is longer. The phone itself isn’t. Prode I am not so sure on this. There was a number of rumorrs pointing to the S8 removing the headphone jack and now it is back. Also why would Samsung go from there normal S7 with a 5.1in screen to having the normal one being 5.8in. That makes no sense to me at all. There would be close to no reason to own a Note next fall if one comes out. Also 6.2in for the biggest one. That is crazy big. I can not see that happening as well. Michael Consider this. We haven’t seen the size of the bezel on the phone. The picture shown in the article does not clearly show the bezel/frame of the front. Without the physical home button, the bezel on the bottom of the phone would be a lot smaller, therefore even if the smaller sized S8 has a screen size of 5.8in, the overall size of the phone can still be the same as the current Galaxy S7 with the larger top and bottom bezel. Same goes for the larger 6.2in S8. S6EdgePlus IsBoss Exactly nobody does it better than Samsung when it comes to producing products in small footprints. Not dorky looking like the useless iPhone 6Plus or iPhone 7plus as well as the worthless Nexus 6p and silly Pixel handsets. squiddy20 “Exactly nobody does it better than Samsung when it comes to producing products in small footprints” And yet, we’re talking about their largest phone to date. I don’t think you have any idea what you’re talking about. auser72 They were able to increase screen size without increasing physical dimensions by eliminating physical home button, and bezel. Prode I guess when you put it that way it could be just seems like a big jump, I feel like that big of a screen may put some ppl off u the size is the same over all. Brian Richards That 5.8 is in a different screen ratio. so the .8 is simply the extra length, not width. And with no buttons, the phone is not going to get bigger. You just get more screen in the same or close to the same phone size. Monitors, as an example used to come in 4:3 ratio. A 19″ 4:3 monitor was really big for average desktop use. Then they went to 16:10 and 16:9 and all of a sudden a 19″ monitor is tiny. This is because the diagonal is stretched over a longer width, so the height becomes a joke. And in modern monitors a 25″ 16:10 is usually plenty of monitor, but if you want a similar feel in the height of the monitor in a 16:9 you need 27″. Same with TV’s. A 32″ 4:3 CRT was absolutely HUGE. While a 32″ 16:9 is not so much. so those phone screen sizes make sense given that the ratio on these is said to be 18.5:9 instead of 16:9. I suspect the extra bit will simply be samsung’s area for their version of the android soft buttons for home, back, menu, tasks, or whatever it is. S6EdgePlus IsBoss Definitely purchasing the S8Plus and GearS3 Frontier day one of launch then will proceed to the Note8 in September. squiddy20 Because you have no life. auser72 Me too, i can’t get rid of this lg v20 quick enough. NardVa I never owned a Samsung, but I’ll get one for the first time if they ditch the home button. dtam hope it doesn’t have the same pink line issue my s7 edge is being sent to repair for (along with many others) T Redd Grab some popcorn and read the comments. Lol. . Reading from my black Galaxy S 7 Brian Richards I LOVE the home button, and I LOVE the fingerprint being on the front. I often unlock my phone in the dock or on a table with my index without picking it up. So I’m going to hesitate on this one. I’ll have to think hard on it if they really move the fingerprint reader to the back. I always use a sturdy case, so case availability and designs will now impact my decision more than usual as the case has the potential to really mess with the reader. If I have to grab the phone and press the power button to wake it up, I will consider that a step backwards in convenience. techieTroy I totally agree! Moving the fingerprint sensor to the back is a heartbreaking deal breaker for me. I rely on bring able to easily turn it on and unlock it with a discreet touch while it’s laying on the conference room table on in the mount in my car. Brian Richards My impression of this pic is that it’s fake. First, that’s a microsd slot on there, not USB C. Second it looks like it’s out of proportion and out of alignment. It also looks like it’s pasted on there after the fact in photoshop. Also, the fingerprint button on the back is EXACTLY the shape of the current home button, which it would be if you were cutting it from the front, rotating it sideways and pasting it on the back. Jay Holm Bluetooth 5.0 & QuickCharge 4.0 are yet to be confirmed. New year, new phone…I expect NEW standards! Samsung failed to included QuickCharge 3.0 in the S7. . .fast charging happens to be a feature that I greatly value. vinnyjr I like the size of my Samsung Galaxy S7. The smallest S8 according to the article is 5.8 inch screen i think. Only 64gb for internal storage. The Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge was released in China this week with a new black color with 128gb of internal storage and supports sd-card. I would rather that phone than the S8. T Redd I hope this isn’t official.. I actually like the home button. Axekick It is consistent with what has been being leaked on this phone for over a month. gorilla I like the large screen idea. Just not the edge design. Axekick Agree. I would prefer a more durable phone with .18″ less screen size to stretching the screen around to the sides. I’m already uneasy handling a new phone I don’t want a sleek phone that requires an extra thick case to protect it, self defeating. Matthew T Wagner No Home Button.. Smh I’ll stick with my Galaxy S7 joyce.godwin@mail.ru I profited 104,000 bucks last year by working online and I did that by working part time for 3+ h every day. I’m using a money making opportunity I was introduced by this company i found on-line and I am so amazed that i was able to make so much extra income. It’s user-friendly and I am just so grateful that i learned about it. Here’s what I do… STATICTAB.COM/dntj48t Limeybastard No home button. WTF. Axekick If they try selling this thing in the United States for $854 & $962 they are not going to sell very many of them. I’m all for innovation when it represents improvements but that thing looks like it’s one short drop from becoming a disaster. That fingerprint scanners is in an absolutely mindless location. Home button under the glass is also thoughtless Smaller battery than the S7 Edge but more screen, no thanks. The S7 Edge is a damn good phone. Samsung is going to need to really put thought and creativity into any new device rather than just rearranging the buttons, decreasing the battery, increasing the screen size, changing the 7 to an 8 and trying to sell them. (If I were in the market I would use this upcoming time they are clearing out S7’s and S7 Edges as an opportune time to purchase a new S7/S7 Edge!)

After months of irrelevant banter and confusing rhetoric, someone is ready to lead. Different organizations have attempted to gain control of OWS, but now the destiny of the movement is clear. A voice for Occupy Wall Street has stepped up. It’s time is now. Ladies and gentlemen … Miley Cyrus. Yes, Miley Cyrus has offered her support for Occupy Wall Street. This week on her website, the social conscience of a generation released a video “dedicated to the thousands of people who are standing up for what they believe in.” The video posted by Cyrus edits Occupy Wall Street video clips over her song “Liberty Walk” from the CD “Can’t be Tamed” — available at Best Buy (NYSE-BBY) for $9.99. Someone needs to take Miley aside and explain to her that the only reason she is relevant is because she made a shitload of Wall Street dough off the “Hannah Montana” franchise, a fictitious corporate nom de plume created for her by Disney (NYSE-DIS). Without The Mouse’s creation of Hannah Montana — movie available at Target (AMEX-TDTF) for $8.19 — Miley Cyrus would be covering “Achy Breaky Heart” in the lobby of the Hampton Inn (NYSE-HIL) in Ashland, Kentucky. I have no particular animosity towards Miss Cyrus. Last week at her nineteenth birthday party she admitted to being a “stoner.” This was following an earlier video of her smoking “legal” pot from a glass bong. For those of us who went to college in the ’70s — a generation one toke away from being an entire graduating class of Lindsay Lohans — her smoking habit is almost endearing. Miley Cyrus’s support for Occupy Wall Street points out the absurdity of the entire protest. Back in June, M Magazine declared Miley Cyrus to be the richest teen in the world and placed her personal wealth at $120,000,000.00. That’s a lot of zeros for someone who wants to show support for people who hate greed. Don’t blame Miley Cyrus for the hypocrisy of OWS. Just peruse the pictures from the various OWS locations. Participants in the Wall Street bash-a-thon are drinking Starbucks (NASDAQ-SBUX) coffee, talking on their Apple (NASDAQ-AAPL) iPhones and browsing the Internet on their Hewlett Packard (NYSE-HPQ) laptops. The fact of the matter is the Occupiers — just like Miley Cyrus — are addicted to corporate America. The irony of people protesting greed while drinking $5.00 cups of coffee is priceless. The great philosopher, Pogo, once said, “We have met the enemy and he is us.” Of course, after he said that, Pogo was fired and is now living in a tent in Zuccotti Park. The thought that protesters support the very system they despise must send a chill right through their North Face (NYSE-VFC) jackets and Ugg boots (NASDAQ-GS). Somewhere in Seattle, Howard Schultz, the CEO of Starbucks, is looking at a picture of a protester drinking a cup of his coffee and laughing his ass off.

(AAPL) Stock Bulls Boeing Co (BA) Stock Gives Savvy Investors a Good Payout View All Posts What’s not to like with Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB)? Maybe nothing longer term. But a post-earnings reaction suggests FB stock may be too well-liked right now and a worthy bear-to-bull modified butterfly candidate. Let me explain. Facebook has done an admirable job over the past couple months shaking off potential H-1B visa threats from the Trump administration to worries over “fake news.” But last week’s “sell the news” reaction may mean that FB needs a breather. Last Wednesday night’s Facebook report showed the company is firing on all cylinders. The social media giant posted a 10 cent profit beat on earnings of $1.41, better-than-forecast revenue growth of 53%, and daily active users of 1.23 billion versus estimates of 1.19 billion. The report sent shares rocketing higher in after-hours trade to $137.25 and slightly lower, all-time-high of $135.49 the next day during the regular session. But gains failed to hold with shares of FB finishing off -1.79%. The problem may be too many investors already “liking” FB right now. A poll of 46 analysts shows 39 rate Facebook a “buy,” three with “outperform,” three holds and just one sell. Also interesting, despite some cheerleading of just how strongly Facebook is killing it on all fronts, CNBC’s Fast Money traders all agreed buying FB right now was not recommended. FB Stock Daily Chart Click to Enlarge Part of the problem with buying Facebook right now may be the nearly 15% gain shares of the social network have enjoyed since the start of 2017. That’s quite a gain for a near $384 billion market capitalization stock. Of course, fellow tech giant Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is up nearly as much while throwing around weight of $675 billion. However, unlike FB, AAPL has gone through a substantial the correction over the past two years in getting back near its all-time-highs. Having said that, part of FB investors’ hesitancy since the earnings release may have to do with the two patterns which marked Thursday’s all-time-high. First, Thursday’s heavy volume, bearish engulfing candlestick is, in of itself, a sign viewed by many technicians as an ominous warning of lower prices. Secondly, the candle sets up as a double-top formation. Combined, it’s not a stretch to see at least a minor corrective move entering Facebook stock.

After months of irrelevant banter and confusing rhetoric, someone is ready to lead. Different organizations have attempted to gain control of OWS, but now the destiny of the movement is clear. A voice for Occupy Wall Street has stepped up. It’s time is now. Ladies and gentlemen … Miley Cyrus. Yes, Miley Cyrus has offered her support for Occupy Wall Street. This week on her website, the social conscience of a generation released a video “dedicated to the thousands of people who are standing up for what they believe in.” The video posted by Cyrus edits Occupy Wall Street video clips over her song “Liberty Walk” from the CD “Can’t be Tamed” — available at Best Buy (NYSE-BBY) for $9.99. Someone needs to take Miley aside and explain to her that the only reason she is relevant is because she made a shitload of Wall Street dough off the “Hannah Montana” franchise, a fictitious corporate nom de plume created for her by Disney (NYSE-DIS). Without The Mouse’s creation of Hannah Montana — movie available at Target (AMEX-TDTF) for $8.19 — Miley Cyrus would be covering “Achy Breaky Heart” in the lobby of the Hampton Inn (NYSE-HIL) in Ashland, Kentucky. I have no particular animosity towards Miss Cyrus. Last week at her nineteenth birthday party she admitted to being a “stoner.” This was following an earlier video of her smoking “legal” pot from a glass bong. For those of us who went to college in the ’70s — a generation one toke away from being an entire graduating class of Lindsay Lohans — her smoking habit is almost endearing. Miley Cyrus’s support for Occupy Wall Street points out the absurdity of the entire protest. Back in June, M Magazine declared Miley Cyrus to be the richest teen in the world and placed her personal wealth at $120,000,000.00. That’s a lot of zeros for someone who wants to show support for people who hate greed. Don’t blame Miley Cyrus for the hypocrisy of OWS. Just peruse the pictures from the various OWS locations. Participants in the Wall Street bash-a-thon are drinking Starbucks (NASDAQ-SBUX) coffee, talking on their Apple (NASDAQ-AAPL) iPhones and browsing the Internet on their Hewlett Packard (NYSE-HPQ) laptops. The fact of the matter is the Occupiers — just like Miley Cyrus — are addicted to corporate America. The irony of people protesting greed while drinking $5.00 cups of coffee is priceless. The great philosopher, Pogo, once said, “We have met the enemy and he is us.” Of course, after he said that, Pogo was fired and is now living in a tent in Zuccotti Park. The thought that protesters support the very system they despise must send a chill right through their North Face (NYSE-VFC) jackets and Ugg boots (NASDAQ-GS). Somewhere in Seattle, Howard Schultz, the CEO of Starbucks, is looking at a picture of a protester drinking a cup of his coffee and laughing his ass off.

(Photo: Siddharth Safaya/News18.com) The Hyundai Grand i10 has been with us in India since 2014. It’s also one of Hyundai’s top selling models in India. Even back in 2014 – when it was launched – it was loaded with convenient features. It was a potent car that was competitive, but as time passed by, consumers were offered more features by its competitors. To top it all, it did need a makeover. Hyundai responds well to such consumer insights. Even before one could complain, they came out with the new 2017 Hyundai Grand i10. The timing couldn't have been better. Maruti Suzuki's new kid Ignis has potential to woo the Grand i10 consumer. But more than a Korean company, Hyundai has been more Indian than many homegrown companies. So before the Ignis became an eyesore for them they came out with the new Grand i10 that matches the Ignis feature by feature, if not more.   What's cool? Now let’s not get carried away here. The 2017 Grand i10 is a facelift and is offered in two engine variants. The 1.2 litre Kappa petrol motor remains the same as the old car. Hyundai, as always, wants to stay ahead of the curve, so they loaded the new Grand i10 with an all-new 1.2-litre second generation U2 diesel engine. This engine is capable of producing 90 PS of power and almost 190 Nm of torque. That's more than enough for your everyday city driving and occasional weekend getaways. The engine has been tuned up and now fits in well with the 5-speed manual transmission. The power delivery of the new diesel engine is quite linear and you are never left wanting more, irrespective of whichever gear you are in. The new Grand i10 is capable of delivering a good pull at any given gear because of the new tuning setup. The 5-speed manual transmission gives a decent throw and you won’t be seen struggling with it. The new Grand i10 gets tweaked cosmetically from the outside now. There are new LED Daytime Running Lights (DRLs). They are not overdone at all and are subtly classy. There are also new 14-inch Diamond-Cut alloy Wheels that adds to the sporty look of the car. The new design on the wheel also makes it look chunkier. 2017 Hyundai Grand i10 from the front. (Photo: Siddharth Safaya/News18.com) And then Hyundai did what every car manufacturer does. Change the bumper. There is a new rear dual-tone bumper. From the front, to give it a bolder stance, there is a new Cascade design grille. It looks well integrated with the body and design of the car. It’s high on safety too with dual-Airbags and ABS. 2017 Hyundai Grand i10 from the back. (Photo: Siddharth Safaya/News18.com) The older Grand i10 did lack some in cabin comforts and features. But now it has them all. It’s a car that you won’t regret living with especially with all the new tech inside it. Hyundai has been playing catch up when it comes to technology inside the cabin, but unlike other brands in India that still believe in a bland cabin, the Koreans decided to add some zing and practicality that the older Grand i10 lacked. The new 2017 Grand i10 now comes with an all-new 7-inch touchscreen infotainment system that comes with voice recognition and a rear parking camera. And the cherry on top is its support for Android Auto and Apple Car Play. This turns your car’s infotainment system into a phone and only gives you access to a limited number of apps so that you are not distracted while driving. There is keyless entry and it does come with an engine start-stop button. The seats are comfortable and there is enough room for people. Five can be a bit of a stretch. The car also comes with automatic climate control now and rear AC vents for passengers. 2017 Hyundai Grand i10 interiors. (Photo: Siddhartha Sharma/News18.com) What's Not So Cool? The 2017 Hyundai Grand i10 has always been a practical city car and it still is. But, what we would have liked more on this one is if some of these features came in all the variants of the Grand i10. All the new jazz that's on offer here is only present in the top end ‘Asta’ Variant, and you have to shell out in excess of Rs 7.50 lakh (ex-showroom, Delhi) to get it all. 2017 Hyundai Grand i10 gets new 14-inch diamond-cut alloy wheels. (Photo: Siddharth Safaya/News18.com) Verdict Back in 2014 when this car was launched, it won many awards. But as technology evolved, it was about time that it got a refresh. Hyundai has responded well and has kickstarted the year 2017 with a promise to cut no corners. Overall, the new 2017 Grand i10 gives you no reason to ignore it and makes better value for money than ever before. Here is the complete pricing of the 2017 Hyundai Grand i10 facelift: Petrol Era – Rs 4,58,400 Magna – Rs 5,22,990 Magna (AT) – Rs 5,98,990 Sports – Rs 5,65,990 Sports (O) – Rs 5,96,295 Sports (O) AT – Rs 6,82,790 Asta – Rs 6,39,890 Diesel Era – Rs 5,68,400 Magna – Rs 6,15,990 Sports – Rs 6,58,989 Sports (O) – Rs 6,89,791 Asta – Rs 7,32,890 (All prices ex-showroom, Delhi) 2017 Hyundai Grand i10 details facelift features Recommended For You New 2017 Hyundai Grand i10 Review: It's Not Going to Be Easy for Ignis Naam Shabana Trailer: Taapsee- Akshay Kumar Starrer Looks Thrilling News18 Movie Awards 2017: Nominees For Best Actress Tamma Tamma: Get Ready to Groove With Varun Dhawan, Alia Bhatt Virat Kohli & Wriddhiman Saha: The New Masters of DRS About Us Privacy Policy Disclaimer Contact Us Sitemap Complaint Redressal Advertise With Us sections India Lifestyle States Tech Politics Auto Sports iVideos Football Power Circuit Latest News Jolly LLB 2 Box Office Collection: Akshay Kumar Starrer Mints Rs 13 Crore on Day 1 K Pandiarajan: Minister Who Jumped Ship to Rattle Chinnamma's Camp Ghost Villages of Uttarakhand Where Netas no Longer Reach Ritz Paris, Andrew Fairlie Crowned 'Grandes Tables du Monde' For 2017 Tamil Nadu Education Minister Pandiarajan Joins Panneerselvam Watch LIVE From Network18 News18 India CricketNext News18 States Pradesh18 Bangla News Gujarati News Urdu News Marathi News Topper Moneycontrol Firstpost CompareIndia History India MTV India In.com Burrp CNN name, logo and all associated elements ® and © 2016 Cable News Network LP, LLLP.

Scher declined further comment.

They’re huge, (most vaguely resemble Princess Leia’s hairdo) weigh so much that you can’t comfortably keep them in place while walking at a brisk pace, and usually require an amp. But what if you like going outside, and don’t have a Sherpa to assist you with a ton of audio gear? Audeze says they have the answer with the iSine10. They are … wait for it… in-ear open planar magnetic headphones. I know. I was skeptical too. Before we discuss sound quality, I need to state the obvious: while the iSine 10 are far smaller and more lightweight than anything Audeze has offered previously, they are still much bigger than pretty much any in-ear I’ve ever seen. The outer portion has a spider-web-looking plastic case that will cover the vast majority of your outer ear. The iSine 10 cover about as much outer-ear real estate as the foam on-ears of 80s walkman fame. The chassis is supported by thin plastic over-ear hooks or rubberized wings that grip inside the antihelix of the ear. Personally, I found the hook more comfortable, but glasses-wearers may gravitate towards the wings. Either way, these are not subtle earbuds, and the weight of the build can feel fatiguing to those with more sensitive ear canals. If that form factor is a deterrent, you wouldn’t be blamed for your hesitation, but you would miss out on some incredible sound quality. With Fluxor N50 magnets and 30mm uniforce diaphragm, the iSine 10 have remarkable clarity, especially when used with the included CIPHER lightning cable. (A standard 3.5mm cable is also included). Audeze claims the iSine 10 have less than .1% full spectrum distortion at 100dB, and the proof is really in the listening. Remarkably spacious sounding, the iSine 10 deliver everything you love about your favorite entry-level over-ear open-backed PM headphones in a weird-looking but wonderfully mobile package. High frequencies are nimble and crisp, with not a hint of sibilance or that 9-10kHz spiked intensity that many headphone manufacturers employ in an attempt to mimic clarity. The lows are deep and full, able to handle thumping hip hop to double bass with equal dexterity, even down to 20Hz.The attack and decay of bass notes is impressive, allowing you to have intense lows that neither muddy nor overwhelm the rest of the frequency range. Overall, the entire sound is smooth and even from the lowest lows to the highest highs. Audeze claims a frequency range of 10Hz-50kHz, so fans of the inaudible psychoacoustic range will have a lot to subconsciously enjoy. Overall, the listening experience is extraordinary for a device so small and affordable. The MSRP is $399.99, which to non-enthusiasts may sound lofty, but any headphone nerd will know is just about the price range where you start to get into the seriously good stuff. And the iSine 10 only has 16 ohms impedance, but can handle a full 3W of power, so whether you are using an iPhone or a portable DAC, you’ll have no trouble powering them. In fact, using my iPhone 7, I was only able to push the volume up to about 30% before they began to get too loud for my comfort. The iSine10’s CIPHER cable has a three-button Apple remote and mic for taking calls, voice commands, and track/volume controls. The standard 3.5mm cable has no controls, but is perfect for use with your favorite hi-rez music player or your laptop at work. Just remember that your results may be limited by the DAC on your device. When compared Apple to Apple (you like what I did there?) on my Macbook Pro via 3.5mm vs my iPhone7 via CIPHER cable, there was a noticeable shift in sound quality. The Macbook pro sounded slightly more veiled and lost some of the sparkle and refined detail that the CIPER cable provided. Keep that in mind, and you’ll be able to get the most out of your listening experience. The Audeze iSine 10 comes with a soft sided carry case and foam-lined hard-sided insert so you can keep the delicate diaphragms safe on your journeys. The case, like the iSine themselves, is larger than usual for in-ears, but at a little bigger than a bar of bath soap, it’s still massively more space conscious than over-ears of any type. Maybe you find most open backed planar magnetic headphones unwieldy, or want a high quality listening experience when you travel, or just don’t want to muss up your hair with a headband. Whatever your reason, the iSine 10 are a fantastic buy, and a worthy addition (or start!) to your high-end headphone collection.

Thirteen years ago, during his confirmation hearing before taking over as federal judge in a district court in Seattle, Robart had exclaimed: “Working with people who have an immediate need and an immediate problem that you are able to help with is the most satisfying aspect of the practice of law”. On February 3, he was able to help thousands of people with an immediate need and an immediate problem. Immigrants and refugees from seven predominantly Muslim nations had been left stranded after newly-minted President Donald Trump issued an executive order banning them from setting foot on US soil--a measure he deemed necessary for national security. As airports started filling with travellers who learnt of their predicament mid-air and many more found themselves unable to even board flights to the US, Robart issued a temporary stay on the order and prohibited their deportation. “How many arrests have there been of foreign nationals from those seven countries since 9/11?” he asked US department of justice lawyer Michelle Bennett, who was representing the Trump administration during the hearing. When Bennett feigned ignorance, Robart himself replied: “None.” Advertisement opens in new window The sigh of relief was global in proportion. Not only did US security forces have to stop detentions and deportations and let immigrants in, but green card and visa holders from the seven countries—Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen—also started rushing back, unsure of how long the window of opportunity would last. Justice Robart isn’t alone. Ex-diplomats and officials argue that the ban actually threatens security by undermining the fight against terror. Before becoming a US federal judge, Rob­art spent nearly three decades in private practice—helping children’s homes manage their legal affairs and representing refugees in courts. Just last year, he had chided the police for excessive use of force against minorities and exclaimed in court that “Black lives matter”—the slogan of a popular grassroots movement against police brutality. It is, therefore, not surprising that he has blocked the president’s anti-immigration executive order. But Robart isn’t alone. Within weeks of taking over, Trump and his presidency are facing a concerted challenge as state administrations, federal and local courts, former officials, captains of industry and the angry half of a bitterly divided nation close ranks against him. Perhaps just as significantly, world leaders have stepped up and spoken out against his apparent undermining of international norms. Advertisement opens in new window Despite his populist appeal, Trump  hasn’t enjoyed the proverbial ‘honeymoon’ period that greets new presidents. Public protests began as soon as he was ele­cted in November, with streets across the US erupting with chants of ‘Not My President’. Americans rallied against the victory of a candidate widely seen as racist, xenophobic and misogynistic, who, it had emerged on his campaign trail, had bragged about assaulting women in the past and whose election promises prominently included a ban on Muslim entry into the US and a wall to fence out Mexico. His inauguration on January 20 witnessed a Women’s March to Washington DC, joined by hundreds of thousands. A week later, when Trump issued the order barring the citizens of seven nations from entering the US for 90 days and putting Syrian refugee admissions on hold indefinitely, people again joined in protest—many of them at airports. Robart’s stay on the order has been supported by federal judges in New York and Boston. In addition, a number of lower courts have blocked different parts of the order. But the legal drama is just starting to unfold. The issue is now being heard in an appeals court in San Francisco. Seventeen states and the District of Columbia have filed briefs in the court, arguing that the immigration ban “unleashed chaos” and—if allowed to go into effect—would harm state institutions, public universities and the economy. They contend that the executive order is unconstitutional, the pre­text of national security is a “sham” and the ban is intended to discriminate against Muslims, as evident from many of Trump’s own statements on the subject. Advertisement opens in new window President Trump has hit back in a manner he knows best. In a tweet, he berated Robart’s ruling as “ridiculous” and called him a “so-called judge”. The justice depar­tment has also filed its brief in the appe­als court, claiming that the president has broad powers to issue such orders in the interests of national security and that courts should not second-guess his intentions. After all, this isn’t the first time a US president is issuing such orders. The Trump team cites eight previous instances, dating back to Ronald Reagan’s order in 1986 to restrict the entry of residents from Cuba, Libya, Russia, Somalia and Yemen. Most recently, President Barack Obama prohibited the processing of refugee requests from Iraq for six months in 2011—and did not disclose the policy for nearly two years. Irrespective of how the appeals court rules, the matter will almost certainly end up in the supreme court. Advertisement opens in new window A recalcitrant judiciary is hardly the president’s only worry. Several former diplomatic, intelligence and security officials, including secretaries of state John Kerry and Madeline Albright, have also filed a declaration against the ban. They argue that the ban in fact threatens national sec­urity by undermining counter-terrorism and law enforcement efforts and putting the lives of US troops and intelligence sources at risk. And senior members of Trump’s own Republican Party, such as senators John McCain and Lindsay Graham, said the ban would help the Islamic State and other militant groups recruit more easily by fomenting hatred. Nearly 100 technology enterprises—inc­luding blue-chip companies such as Google, Facebook, Microsoft and Apple—have urged the courts to overturn the ban to pro­­tect the “competitiveness of US compa­nies”. Other businesses have also publicly come out against the ban. Starbucks, for instance, declared it would hire 10,000 ref­ugees worldwide. Many others have exp­ressed support for their foreign employees. Trump’s election and inauguration also sent temperatures rising outside American shores. A petition to block his upcoming state visit to Britain has gathered over a million signatures. On February 6, speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, cited parliament’s anti-racism/sexism sta­nce and said Trump shouldn’t be allowed to address MPs on his visit. Advertisement opens in new window Since he issued the Muslim ban, a number of world leaders—including some of America’s closest allies—have become publicly critical. Hours after meeting Trump in the White House, British Prime Minister Theresa May said that “we do not agree with this kind of approach”. Justin Trudeau, the prime minister of next-door Canada, tweeted that refugees were welcome in his country. Meanwhile, German Chancellor Angela Merkel reminded Trump about America’s responsibility towards refugees under the Geneva Conventions. If these early days are any indication, Pre­sident Trump faces some extremely challenging years ahead in office. He did not issue the immigration ban out of a genuine fear for national security—as is apparent from the countries on the list—but to begin implementing the racist and xenophobic agenda he promised at the hustings. That is also the reason why everyone, from judges and lawyers to current and former officials, business leaders and even international allies, have ranged against him so quickly. They realise this is just the beg­inning—that if left unchallenged, Trump would move to implement a plethora of other campaign vows, including blanket bans on Muslim immigration, a registry for Muslims in the country, the wall on the Mexican border and so on. He would also renegotiate regional and global free trade agreements the US is party to and security commitments to Nato allies, as promised. Advertisement opens in new window With his January 27 order, the president was testing the waters for his way-out-in-the-left-field agenda. He has found out that the waters are a little too deep, and perhaps a little too hot, for comfort.

 What you need to know on Wall Street right now Business Insider Feb. 8, 2017, 12:58 PM 701 facebook linkedin twitter email print Seth Klarman, president and CEO of the The Baupost Group Getty Images/ Scott Olson Welcome to Finance Insider, Business Insider's summary of the top stories of the past 24 hours.

Here are five times the long-running comedy series got it right. 1. Lady Gaga’s halftime show On the 2012 episode “Lisa Goes Gaga,” Lady Gaga is shown suspended by cables flying over the audience at a concert. Well, surprise, surprise — Gaga descended from the roof of Houston’s NRG Stadium with suspension cables during the Super Bowl LI halftime show. And she was wearing pretty much the same space-agey silver outfit she wore on “The Simpsons.” 2. Donald Trump presidency Seventeen years ago, in an episode titled “Bart to the Future,” Lisa becomes president after Donald Trump, apparently, ruined the economy. 3. Nobel Prize winner In a 2010 episode, Milhouse predicted that a Finnish MIT professor named Bengt R. Holmstrom would win the Nobel Prize in Economics and, sure enough, in 2016 Holmstrom and Oliver Hart were announced as joint winners of the prize. 4. Smartwatches Sorry, Apple, but “The Simpsons” had smartwatches first. In a 1995 episode set in the future, Lisa’s husband is shown speaking to a phone on his wrist. The first smartwatch wasn’t created until 2013. 5. Arnold Palmer’s death On the 28th season premiere in September 2016, the satirical series made an Arnold Palmer joke ... on the very day that golfer Arnold Palmer died. Homer tells his wife, Marge, that he intends to “Arnold Palmer” his pal Lenny. “Arnold Palmer Lenny?” Marge responds with irritation. “You’re going to Arnold Palmer Lenny?” He was, of course, referring to the lemonade and iced tea drink mixture — which was named after the late golfer.

Daily Edition Login to download MTV's Mina Lefevre Departs to Lead Development at Facebook 5:09 PM PST 2/8/2017 by Natalie Jarvey FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Courtesy of MTV Mina Lefevre She will report to Ricky Van Veen, who joined the social network from CollegeHumor last year. MTV executive vp Mina Lefevre is leaving the network for a new position as head of development at Facebook.  Lefevre, who was upped to the top job at the cable network in 2015 following the departure of Susanne Daniels to YouTube, announced the move Wednesday on Facebook. Her post reads: "I have always been drawn to the idea of building something and the idea of being part of the team that helps build Facebook's original content ecosystem ... well, that just seems like a dream!"  Lefevre will work on the team run by Facebook head of global creative strategy Ricky Van Veen, who joined the social network last year from CollegeHumor as part of its effort to place more of an emphasis on video. In December, Van Veen revealed that Facebook would begin buying original scripted and unscripted programming in an effort to seed its newly launched video tab. "Earlier this year, we started rolling out the video tab, a dedicated place for video on Facebook," Van Veen said at the time he announced the initiative to begin seeding the social network with highly produced video content. "Our goal is to kickstart an ecosystem of partner content for the tab, so we're exploring funding some seed video content, including original and licensed scripted, unscripted, and sports content, that takes advantage of mobile and social interaction unique to Facebook. Our goal is to show people what is possible on the platform and learn as we continue to work with video partners around the world."  The company, which for years said it was not interested in becoming a buyer of content, has been vague about its plans and is clearly still in the early days of setting up its team and strategy around the effort. CEO Mark Zuckerberg, for whom video is a big priority, said earlier this month during a call with investors that he's "going to keep putting video first across our family of apps." He also clarified that Facebook will begin by buying short-form content and see how that performs before looking at traditional-length projects that could make it a more serious competitor to TV and streaming services like Netflix.  Lefevre is the first major hire for Van Veen's team. She held roles at ABC Family and Fox Family Networks before joining MTV, where she ran scripted programming from 2013-2015, working on such shows as Scream and Finding Carter. Lefevre also oversaw the development of The Shannara Chronicles, the cable network's attempt at a sweeping, Game of Thrones-style series that has been renewed for a second season. Her likely successor is said to be Maggie Malina, who currently serves as executive vp and head of scripted at VH1.  Facebook's move to build up a development team with an experienced TV executive comes as the technology industry looks increasingly to a future tied to Hollywood. After years as an advertising-only platform, YouTube in 2015 launched subscription service Red and hired Daniels away from MTV to run point on the development of TV-style series that would appeal to its young audience. Apple, meanwhile, has begun buying TV projects including a Carpool Karaoke spinoff and reality series Planet of the Apps as a way to drum up more business for its Apple Music offering. Even Snapchat, which is much younger than the other companies and is still in the process of going public, has experimented with buying and producing its own programming. The recent iteration of its strategy is to work with the TV networks on companion series to popular franchises like The Voice and The Bachelor that are oriented toward its mobile audience.  FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Natalie Jarvey Natalie.Jarvey@thr.com NatJarv Comments comments powered by Disqus The Hollywood Reporter © 2017 The Hollywood Reporter All rights reserved.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Review Review: Samsung’s Chromebook Pro will change the way you look at Chrome Image Source: Zach Epstein, BGR Zach Epstein @zacharye February 10th, 2017 at 9:00 AM Share Tweet Taking over the world isn’t easy, but Google is well on its way. The company’s Android platform is still in its infancy in the grand scheme of things, and yet smart thinking on Google’s part caused adoption to skyrocket in no time at all. By making Android open source and offering it to hardware vendors for free (with important strings attached), Google made the decision all too easy for companies like Samsung, HTC and Motorola, which all needed a fresh new platform to enter the smartphone market. After all, it was becoming increasingly obvious that industry leaders like Nokia and BlackBerry were doomed. And why build your own platform when you can use Android for free? The goal for Google, of course, is to put its various products and services in front of as many eyeballs as possible, and to make it as easy as possible to access and use them. The more often people use Google services, the more data Google can collect and the more ads Google can display. The company is doing great things, of that there is no question, but Google is a business and selling ads is how it stays in business. With the smartphone market covered, Google has expanded its presence in other key markets. Android TV, Android Wear, and Google’s work with IoT devices are all examples of the company’s efforts to widen its reach. And then there’s Chrome, which continues to be dismissed by some industry watchers despite having made tremendous gains in recent years; despite the overall decline in the PC market last year, Chromebook shipments climbed 20%. The majority of Chromebook gains have come in the education and low-end consumer markets, where cost among the biggest factors that contribute to purchase decisions. But Google and its partners will have to address other markets as well if Chrome is to become a major player in the market. Don't Miss: Is this the perfect Android phone? It’s easy to dismiss Chrome OS. Windows is massive! Windows is too big to fail! Windows will be the world’s go-to desktop computing for decades to come! Of course, those of us who have been covering consumer tech for as long as I have can remember when the exact same things were said about Symbian, Windows Mobile and BlackBerry OS. In fact, Nokia executives used to laugh at me in 2007 and 2008 when I asked them how they planned to adapt to the shifting smartphone market. I don’t imagine any of those executives are laughing anymore. Now, this isn’t to say that Windows is a doomed platform — at least, not anytime soon. But to state things mildly, the future does not look terribly bright for Windows at the moment. Market research firm IDC estimates that 428.5 million smartphones shipped in the fourth quarter alone last year, with the overwhelming majority of those phones having been powered by Android. Meanwhile, IDC says that a total of 260.2 million PCs shipped in all of 2016. Even though Microsoft currently owns more than 90% of the PC market according to Net Applications, Android user numbers have continued to grow while PC shipments decline. So, what happens years from now when all these Android users have the option to buy a new Windows PC, or a new Chrome OS computer that gives them tighter integration with their phones and access to all the same apps and services they enjoy on other devices, in addition to desktop-grade apps? Of course, Android apps themselves will likely be “desktop-grade” by then, but the point is Microsoft’s advantages with Windows have been dwindling slowly over the past decade, and it looks like the pace may soon accelerate. Especially when you add Chrome devices like the new Samsung Chromebook Pro into the mix. First, a few thoughts on Chrome OS, which shares a name with Google’s wildly popular cross-platform web browser. This is apropos, as anyone who has used a Chrome computer will tell you, because the operating system itself looks and feels very similar to Chrome for Windows or Mac, and the Chrome browser is the focal point of Chrome OS. The best way to describe Chrome OS may be to call it something of a hybrid between the Chrome desktop browser and the Android platform. The user interface will feel quite familiar to anyone with an Android smartphone, because it utilizes the same Material Design elements as Android. Out of the box, however, most functions happen in the browser (even in offline mode). Upon powering up a Chrome device for the first time, users will be greeted with a familiar desktop view similar to what you might find on a Windows or Mac PC. A “Launcher” button in the bottom-left corner replaces the Start button you’d find on a Windows machine, and a series of app icons are found in the menu bar beside it. Clicking those app icons doesn’t open individual apps, however. Instead, they open associated web pages. So, for example, clicking the Gmail icon will take you to gmail.com, and clicking the Docs icon will open the Google Docs website. You can still save files and work on them offline, and you can also download new “apps” from Google’s Chrome Web Store. Those apps all live within the Chrome browser, however — on a Chrome OS device, the browser is a portal into nearly every function. At least, it used to be. On newer Chromebooks like Samsung’s Chromebook Pro, users also have access to the Google Play store along with all the Android apps within. While some apps work better than others on Chrome OS, new users will be surprised at how well Android apps function on their Chrome devices. As just one example, Newton — my go-to email app on iOS and macOS devices — is far faster on the Chromebook Pro than on my MacBook Air. In fact, the Android version is better designed as well, and is ironically better suited to a desktop environment than the macOS version. In fact, it feels like everything is faster on the Chromebook Pro than it is on a conventional computer. Samsung’s Chromebook Pro is powered by a 2.2GHz Intel Core m3 processor along with Intel HD graphics and 4GB of LPDDR3 RAM. Those specs would seem underpowered on a Windows or Mac machine, but Chrome OS strips out the complexities that most consumers likely don’t need anyway. It feels like a mobile OS, and it flies like a mobile OS. Websites load just as fast as they would on any Windows or Apple PC, and apps open even faster since they’re so much more streamlined. Samsung’s less expensive Chromebook Plus is powered by a 2GHz hexa-core OP1 ARM chipset, which offers a bit less power and lesser graphics performance while shaving $100 from the device’s price tag. The two models are otherwise nearly identical. In its current state, the Chrome OS platform is more than capable enough to handle both work and play for the vast majority of users. Chrome is not yet ready for people who need to use custom enterprise software or complex software like professional video editing apps. But for everyone else, it’s a serious contender. As you might expect on a Samsung device, the 12.3-inch LED display on the Chromebook Pro is stunning. It features 2400×1600 Quad HD resolution and brightness is rated at 400nit. Streaming videos look fantastic on the bright screen, and the 3:2 aspect ratio offers plenty of room to position multiple apps around the screen and multitask. The Chromebook Pro also ships with a stylus that can be popped out from an edge just like a Note-series smartphone or tablet. It’s not quite as feature rich as the S Pen and it’s certainly not integrated as deeply into the operating system, but it’s great for taking notes. For drawing or painting, Samsung’s new notebook will ship with an app called Art Canvas, though it wasn’t available in the pre-release software running on my test unit. The stylus can also be used to capture portions of the screen, or as a virtual magnifying glass to help users read small print. Samsung put a great deal of effort into the writing experience on the Chromebook Pro, and it shows. The feel is fantastic — as close to “pen on paper” as Samsung’s Note smartphones — and a special algorithm developed by Google helps lower latency by predicting where each stroke will go as you write. There is still noticeable latency on the device when you write quickly, but I don’t find it to be bothersome at all. Also of note, the screen on the Chromebook Pro can fold all the way open so the device can be used comfortably in tablet mode. I only wish as much attention had been paid to the keyboard, which is one of my least favorite things about this laptop. The plastic keys on the device feel cheap and they require too much pressure to depress. I also wish the keyboard had wider delete and tab keys, though I do like the dedicated Search button in place of the Caps Lock. This key opens the Launcher window, which is a home base of sorts in Chrome OS, giving users access to a search bar and to apps. The trackpad is nice and big on the Chromebook Pro, and it’s also quite responsive. The device includes two USB Type-C ports, either of which can be used to charge the notebook, as well as a 3.5mm audio jack and a microSD card slot. The Chromebook Pro ships with just 32GB of onboard storage since Chrome OS is a cloud-first platform, but microSDXC support adds an inexpensive and easy option for expansion. The device itself weighs just 2.38 pounds and measures 11.04 x 8.72 x 0.55 inches. That makes it thinner and lighter than Apple’s new 13-inch MacBook Pro, which measures 0.59 inches thick and weighs a hair over 3 pounds. The light weight can be attributed in part to the plastic housing, but the Chromebook Pro also only has a 39-watt-hour battery compared to up to 54.5-watt-hours in the 13-inch MacBook Pro. The Chromebook still manages to offer an estimated 8-10 hours of battery life per charge though, thanks largely to its efficient Core m3 chipset and the lightweight Chrome OS. In the end, the Chromebook Pro is a device that redefines the Chromebook category. It’s the first Chromebook to include an integrated stylus and pen support, but the laptop’s power plays a bigger role in this area. Samsung’s Chromebook Pro and devices like it offer performance that hasn’t been seen before on a Chrome OS device, extending the addressable market to include power users who otherwise wouldn’t look twice at a Chromebook. As for pricing and availability, the Samsung Chromebook Pro will be released sometime in late April for $549. Of note, the Google Play store for Chrome will exit beta around the same time. Samsung’s more affordable ARM-powered Chromebook Plus can be preordered right now for $449 on Amazon or on Samsung’s website, and it will start shipping this Sunday, February 12th.

(Mandel Ngan / AFP/Getty Images) By Maura Dolan and David LauterContact Reporters Immigration Donald Trump Islamic State A federal appeals court is considering whether to lift a hold on President Trump’s moratorium on travel from seven predominantly Muslim countries, and it has already received a flurry of written arguments on how the case should be decided. A three-judge panel of the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals is expected to reach a decision after the Trump administration files further arguments by 3 p.m. Monday.  The case stems from a temporary restraining order issued Friday by U.S. District Judge James L. Robart in Seattle. The judge, an appointee of former President George W. Bush, blocked the government from enforcing President Trump’s Jan. 27 executive order. The ruling came in response to a challenge from the states of Washington and Minnesota.  The Trump administration has argued the states lack standing to challenge the travel ban because they cannot show the executive order has directly harmed them. Documents Read the executive order that ignited the firestorm and the ensuing legal filings. The U.S. Supreme Court has overturned some major 9th Circuit rulings in the past after concluding that those who sued lacked standing. Interestingly, the Obama administration was unsuccessful in trying to argue that states that challenged its executive order shielding a number of so-called Dreamer immigrants from deportation lacked standing to challenge the order. In that case, the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals blocked Obama’s order, and the Supreme Court tied 4-4 over the issue. It was that case that Robart cited in ruling against the Trump administration on the current moratorium. Whatever decision the 9th Circuit reaches on the travel ban could be the final word for some time, if the Supreme Court does not agree to review it, or can’t muster a majority. Keep in mind, though, that the appeals court on Monday is deciding only whether to stay the order until the legal merits can be reviewed. Below are key arguments opposing parties have made on the travel ban hold. Trump administration The states claim that they are harmed by virtue of the damage that implementation of the order has inflicted upon the operations and missions of their public universities and other institutions of higher learning, as well as injury to the states’ operations, tax bases, and public funds. … These attenuated and speculative alleged harms are neither concrete nor particularized. The administration also argued that the hold on Trump’s order harmed the government by infringing on the president’s power over foreign affairs. The states maintain the government has not suffered any real harm. The injunction contravenes the constitutional separation of powers; harms the public by thwarting enforcement of an Executive Order issued by the nation’s elected representative responsible for immigration matters and foreign affairs; and second-guesses the President’s national security judgment about the quantum of risk posed by the admission of certain classes of aliens and the best means of minimizing that risk. States of Washington and Minnesota The states argued the ban violates constitutional guarantees of due process and equal protection and religious freedom. In the following section, the states, citing a precedent from a key same-sex marriage case, contend that the mere scope of the order shows it was intended to discriminate. Even if the Order did not make suspect classifications, it would be illegal because ‘its sheer breadth is so discontinuous with the reasons offered for it that the [Order] seems inexplicable by anything but animus toward the class it affects.’ Romer v. Evans, 517 U.S. 620, 632 (1996). For several months it bans all travelers from the listed countries and all refugees, whether they be infants, schoolchildren, or grandparents. And though it cites the attacks of September 11, 2001, as a rationale, it imposes no restrictions on people from the countries whose nationals carried out those attacks. ‘It is at once too narrow and too broad,’ id. at 633, and cannot withstand any level of scrutiny. See, e.g., United States v. Windsor, 133 S. Ct. 2675, 2693 (2013) (‘The Constitution’s guarantee of equality must at the very least mean that a bare [legislative] desire to harm a politically unpopular group cannot justify disparate treatment of that group.’). The states also contrasted Trump’s action with previous cases involving presidential actions on immigration. Second, Defendants cite Kleindienst v. Mandel, 408 U.S. 753 (1972), and Kerry v. Din, 135 S. Ct. 2128 (2015), for the proposition that so long as the President gives a facially legitimate reason for excluding an alien, the courts will not look behind that reason. But those cases dealt with the President’s power to exclude ‘an unadmitted and nonresident alien,’ i.e., someone who had no legal right to be here. Mandel, 408 U.S. at 762; Din, 135 S. Ct. at 2131. This case, by contrast, involves longtime residents who are here and have constitutional rights. Moreover, Justice Kennedy’s controlling opinion in Din held that courts should look behind the stated motives for exclusion even as to a nonresident alien if the plaintiff “plausibly alleged with sufficient particularity” “an affirmative showing of bad faith.” Id. at 2141. See also Cardenas v. United States, 826 F.3d 1164, 1171 (9th Cir. 2016) (same). Here, the State has plausibly alleged with sufficient particularity that the President acted in bad faith in an effort to target Muslims. ECF 18 ¶¶ 42-61. Thus, courts have both the right and the duty to examine Defendants’ true motives. 97 companies tell the court how the travel ban harms them The companies, including Microsoft, Twitter, Google and Apple, are making an economic argument on why the hold should stay in place. The companies cited the outsized role that immigrants have played in the United States in obtaining patents and winning Nobel prizes and argued that the ban could force industry to relocate overseas to ensure availability of talent from around the world. Trump campaigned on keeping jobs in the United States, and the tech companies argued that his executive order will have the opposite effect. The Order effects a sudden shift in the rules governing entry into the United States, and is inflicting substantial harm on U.S. companies. It hinders the ability of American companies to attract great talent; increases costs imposed on business; makes it more difficult for American firms to compete in the international marketplace; and gives global enterprises a new, significant incentive to build operations — and hire new employees — outside the United States. The Order violates the immigration laws and the Constitution. In 1965, Congress prohibited discrimination on the basis of national origin precisely so that the Nation could not shut its doors to immigrants based on where they come from. Moreover, any discretion under the immigration laws must be exercised reasonably, and subject to meaningful constraints. Former national security and intelligence officials Ten former national security, foreign policy and intelligence officials argued the travel ban was threatening the safety of Americans. Most of the officials served solely in Democratic administrations. The Order will endanger U.S. troops in the field. Every day, American soldiers work and fight alongside allies in some of the named countries who put their lives on the line to protect Americans. For example, allies who would be barred by the Order work alongside our men and women in Iraq fighting against ISIL, [the militant group Islamic State]. To the extent that the Order bans travel by individuals cooperating against ISIL, we risk placing our military efforts at risk by sending an insulting message to those citizens and all Muslims. The Order will disrupt key counterterrorism, foreign policy, and national security partnerships that are critical to our obtaining the necessary information sharing and collaboration in intelligence, law enforcement, military, and diplomatic channels to address the threat posed by terrorist groups such as ISIL. The international criticism of the Order has been intense, and it has alienated U.S. allies. It will strain our relationships with partner countries in Europe and the Middle East, on whom we rely for vital counterterrorism cooperation, undermining years of effort to bring them closer. By alienating these partners, we could lose access to the intelligence and resources necessary to fight the root causes of terror or disrupt attacks launched from abroad, before an attack occurs within our borders. maura.dolan@latimes.com Twitter: @mauradolan ALSO Legal battle over Trump's travel ban could rest on Supreme Court's view of the limits of presidential power A flurry of legal arguments as appeals court decides whether Trump's immigration ban will be enforced California joins 15 other states going to court to challenge Trump's immigration orders       Copyright © 2017, Los Angeles Times Most Popular Local Sports Entertainment Politics Opinion Place An Ad 60°

(REUTERS/Brian Snyder) By Dustin Volz, Reuters Feb 6, 2017 at 2:41 pm | Print View WASHINGTON — National security veterans from both parties and major U.S. technology companies expressed opposition to Donald Trump’s temporary travel ban in a court case as his administration prepared on Monday to justify the measure, the most controversial policy of his two-week old presidency. Trump’s executive order of Jan. 27, temporarily barring entry to the United States of people from seven Muslim-majority countries and halting the U.S. refugee program, was suspended by a federal judge in Seattle on Friday. That opened a window for travelers from the seven countries to enter. The government now has until 3 p.m. PST on Monday to submit additional legal briefs to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco in support of Trump’s order. A decision either way may ultimately result in the case reaching the U.S. Supreme Court. The new Republican president, who has said the travel measures are to protect the country against the threat of terrorism, has reacted to challenges to his ban by attacking the federal judge in Seattle and then the wider court system. Ten former national security and foreign policy officials, who served under both Republican and Democratic presidents, filed a declaration in the court case arguing the travel ban serves no national security purposes. It was signed by former secretaries of state including John Kerry, Madeleine Albright, Condoleezza Rice and former CIA directors Michael Hayden and Michael Morell. Over the weekend, the appeals court in San Francisco denied the administration’s request for an immediate suspension of the federal judge’s temporary restraining order that blocked the implementation of key parts of the travel ban. But the court did say it would consider the government’s request after receiving more information. Trump faces an uphill battle in the San Francisco court, which is dominated by liberal-leaning judges. And appeals courts are generally leery of upending the status quo, which in this case is the suspension of the ban. On a visit to the military’s Central Command headquarters in Tampa, Florida, Trump defended his order. “Radical Islamic terrorists are determined to strike our homeland as they did on 9/11,” he said. “We need strong programs for people who love our country,” Trump said, adding that he did not want to allow “people who want to destroy us and destroy our country” into the United States. The measures put a 90-day ban on entry for citizens from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen and a 120-day halt to all refugees. Top technology companies, including Apple, Google and Microsoft banded together with nearly 100 firms on Sunday to file a “friend-of-the-court” brief with the appeals court, arguing the travel ban “inflicts significant harm on American business, innovation, and growth.” PRESIDENTIAL POWERS Curbing entry to the United States as a national security measure was a central premise of Trump’s run for office, originally proposed during his campaign as a temporary ban on Muslims. U.S. presidents have in the past claimed sweeping powers to fight terrorism, but individuals, states and civil rights groups challenging the travel order say his administration has offered no evidence it answers a threat. Protesters have taken to the street accusing Trump of discriminating against Muslims. The government says the president is exercising his constitutional authority to control borders and that the law allows him to suspend the entry of any class of foreigners who “would be detrimental to the interest of the United States.” The New America think tank says that all of the people who have carried out fatal attacks inspired by Islamist militancy in the United States since the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks have been U.S. citizens or legal residents. None of those attackers emigrated or came from a family that emigrated from one of the countries listed in the travel ban. (http://bit.ly/2keSmUO) A businessman who had never held public office until he assumed the presidency on Jan. 20, Trump has vented his frustration over the legal challenges with a volley of attacks on the judiciary. Trump derided U.S. District Judge James Robart in Seattle, who issued the temporary stay on Friday, as a “so-called judge.” On Sunday, he broadened his Twitter attacks on Robart, who was appointed by former Republican President George W. Bush, to include the “court system.” “Just cannot believe a judge would put our country in such peril,” Trump tweeted. “If something happens blame him and court system.” Trump did not elaborate on what threats the country potentially faced. It is unusual for a sitting president to attack a member of the judiciary, which the U.S. Constitution designates as a check on the power of the presidency and Congress. Democrats seized on Trump’s remarks to raise questions about how independent his Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch, might be.

After months of irrelevant banter and confusing rhetoric, someone is ready to lead. Different organizations have attempted to gain control of OWS, but now the destiny of the movement is clear. A voice for Occupy Wall Street has stepped up. It’s time is now. Ladies and gentlemen … Miley Cyrus. Yes, Miley Cyrus has offered her support for Occupy Wall Street. This week on her website, the social conscience of a generation released a video “dedicated to the thousands of people who are standing up for what they believe in.” The video posted by Cyrus edits Occupy Wall Street video clips over her song “Liberty Walk” from the CD “Can’t be Tamed” — available at Best Buy (NYSE-BBY) for $9.99. Someone needs to take Miley aside and explain to her that the only reason she is relevant is because she made a shitload of Wall Street dough off the “Hannah Montana” franchise, a fictitious corporate nom de plume created for her by Disney (NYSE-DIS). Without The Mouse’s creation of Hannah Montana — movie available at Target (AMEX-TDTF) for $8.19 — Miley Cyrus would be covering “Achy Breaky Heart” in the lobby of the Hampton Inn (NYSE-HIL) in Ashland, Kentucky. I have no particular animosity towards Miss Cyrus. Last week at her nineteenth birthday party she admitted to being a “stoner.” This was following an earlier video of her smoking “legal” pot from a glass bong. For those of us who went to college in the ’70s — a generation one toke away from being an entire graduating class of Lindsay Lohans — her smoking habit is almost endearing. Miley Cyrus’s support for Occupy Wall Street points out the absurdity of the entire protest. Back in June, M Magazine declared Miley Cyrus to be the richest teen in the world and placed her personal wealth at $120,000,000.00. That’s a lot of zeros for someone who wants to show support for people who hate greed. Don’t blame Miley Cyrus for the hypocrisy of OWS. Just peruse the pictures from the various OWS locations. Participants in the Wall Street bash-a-thon are drinking Starbucks (NASDAQ-SBUX) coffee, talking on their Apple (NASDAQ-AAPL) iPhones and browsing the Internet on their Hewlett Packard (NYSE-HPQ) laptops. The fact of the matter is the Occupiers — just like Miley Cyrus — are addicted to corporate America. The irony of people protesting greed while drinking $5.00 cups of coffee is priceless. The great philosopher, Pogo, once said, “We have met the enemy and he is us.” Of course, after he said that, Pogo was fired and is now living in a tent in Zuccotti Park. The thought that protesters support the very system they despise must send a chill right through their North Face (NYSE-VFC) jackets and Ugg boots (NASDAQ-GS). Somewhere in Seattle, Howard Schultz, the CEO of Starbucks, is looking at a picture of a protester drinking a cup of his coffee and laughing his ass off.

The firm's first Android smartphone, the Nokia N6, has already sold out in China, and the firm is hoping for similar success with the incoming Nokia P1.  While details are still few and far between, we already know some features that we can expect to see on the so-called P1.  1. It's going to launch at MWC.  HMD Global, the firm that now owns the Nokia licence, has confirmed that it will be holding a press conference on 26 February in Barcelona, where the Nokia P1 is widely expected to make its debut, alongside the lesser-specced Nokia D1C.  There's no word on an official release date yet, but Nokia itself has confirmed an early-2017 release for its upcoming Android devices. 2. It'll be available in two sizes The Nokia P1 will reportedly be available in two sizes - 5.2in and 5.5in - taking a leaf out of Apple's book with the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. These two displays will both offer a 2560x1440 QHD resolution and will tout Galaxy S7-style AMOLED technology.   123  Tweet   Facebook       Send to   Topics Mobile Phones Android Cloud computing in-depth Nokia V3 Latest Nokia P1: 6 things to expect from firm's comeback smartphone The key features expected on Nokia's flagship Android smartphone Mobile Phones 11 February 2017 NASA report blames faulty IT patch for fire that destroyed space craft kit Patch also knocked fire alarm systems offline Public Sector 10 February 2017 WhatsApp rolls out two-step verification to boost security offerings Follows on from roll out of end-to-end encryption last year Security 10 February 2017 Chuwi LapBook 14.1 review Can a sub $300 laptop really be worth the investment?

Laptops by Joshua Goldman February 7, 2017 7:11 AM PST @ByJoshG An Intel design patent shows a curved screen for a 2-in-1 laptop/tablet. Intel Intel's processors power the majority of laptops, but it doesn't actually make laptops. That hasn't stopped the chipmaker from patenting a design here and there. Among the company's latest is a 2-in-1 laptop/tablet hybrid with a detachable curved display according to a design patent. The US Patent and Trademark Office granted the patent in November, but apparently it went noticed until TheLeaker.com published details about the patent on Sunday. Curved displays on TVs and phones are nothing new. However, with the exception of Acer's $9,000 Predator 21 X, they haven't been used for laptops and tablets. Unlike the Acer's, Intel's design features a curved keyboard base, which may not be ideal on all surfaces. Likewise, such a curve on a tablet could prove awkward for drawing or writing. Demand for personal computers has been in steady decline for the past five years, though, so it may just be designs like this that spark consumer interest. Does the Mac still matter?

Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 11 February 2017 by Military News Startup Success -ALIVE- Launches New App GOOS (1888PressRelease) February 11, 2017 – Maverick Co., Ltd. today announced the official release of their newest app GOOS. GOOS is a free video editing service that uses live filters and in-camera effects to create fun and one-of-a-kind 10 second videos. The key features of GOOS are its live filters and interactive stickers and effects. It’s a real time video editing app, which means it is possible to add motion effects while filming with simple swipes and taps. This is the second app from Maverick’s founder and CEO Johnny Oh, and is part of a vision to expand the short form video industry. The company’s first app, ALIVE, has received over 5 Million downloads to date from both the App Store and the Google Play Store. Ben Martinez, age 13 from Queens, NY, says, “What I like about this app is that it’s just like Snapchat so it’s really easy to use and I can send my video to anybody I want. Some of my friends don’t have Snapchat and with Snapchat, you can only send your videos to the Snapchat users but with GOOS, I can send my video to any other apps I have on the phone.” Jennifer Moor, age 16 from Pasadena, CA, is an avid Musical.ly fan. She says, “The other time, my friends and I were pretending like we were stuck in the Himalayan mountain and we were trying to dodge the snowball effect. I still laugh out loud when I look at the video. It’s on my Instagram and I got so many likes and comments.” One of the main features of GOOS is interactiveness. The users can be part of a whole new world of imagination and engage in augmented reality. GOOS can be downloaded for free at https://itunes.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1179310998 or can be found using the keywords “GOOS” or “GOOS Cam” on the App Store. Note that GOOS is currently only available for iOS, with an Android version currently in development.

GameCentral for Metro.co.ukSaturday 11 Feb 2017 1:00 am Which way did you jump? GameCentral readers reveal whether they’ve jumped formats from PlayStation to Xbox or Xbox to PlayStation… and why. The subject for this week’s Hot Topic was suggested by reader Grackle, who asked why you made the change and if things have worked out as you hoped. Now that we’re reaching what is probably the midpoint of the generation are you considering getting the other format as well, and what do you see as the pros and cons of doing that? It turned out many people had switched sides, in large part due to the Xbox One’s poor unveiling. But many now have both consoles or have already switched back. Exclusive games were the most common reason, with almost no one mentioning increased power.   Semper fi is a lie I had an Xbox 360 last gen and, like many – or at least many of my mates – I switch to PlayStation 4 this gen. There were a few reasons for this, the obvious one being the original incarnation of the Xbox One and all the U-turns. This played into Sony’s hands in a number of ways, but one of the simpler is that it simply made an excuse to go back to PlayStation for a while and try out all the exclusives I’d missed. I don’t know if they’ve realised it now but the idea that anyone is loyal to Microsoft or Sony is an illusion. People might try to justify their purchases after they’ve bought but I think the number of fanboys that will only buy one or the other without ever thinking about it is very low. Nintendo maybe. People are loyal to that for the games, and I can understand it. But Microsoft and Sony exclusives aren’t really like that. Maybe Halo was for a time but I can’t think of any franchise now that I couldn’t do with out for a generation. (Although saying that I will be interested in Project Scorpio if it’s a big jump up.) Dengar   Complete set I didn’t think I would switch, especially after the way Microsoft handled the launch of their console, but I’ve ended up with both PlayStation 4 and Xbox One this generation. The games on each are good and I’m quite happy to say neither is better than the other (they both have strengths and weaknesses). Come March and I’ll be adding the Switch to the list, and all three will be vying for use thanks to Zelda: Breath Of The Wild on the Switch, Horizon: Zero Dawn on the PlayStation 4, and Mass Effect: Andromeda on the Xbox One (I know you can get it on PlayStation 4 too, but I have the whole Mass Effect series on my Xbox One, so that will be the first console version I get). Both the PS4 Pro and Project Scorpio consoles look interesting, but so far I’ve only found a couple of reasons to think of buying the Pro: namely VR and the extra modes supported by Horizon: Zero Dawn and Rise Of The Tomb Raider. If Microsoft come out with VR for the Scorpio I can see me gaining interest for it then, as I’m a sucker for VR. Gleth   Mangy mutt I turned my back on Sony this generation simply because I fancied a change. I’m also allergic to popular opinion and prefer to champion the underdog. And what a dog the Xbox One is. When I first bought the console at the end of 2015 I was horrified by the game installation times. I still am slightly horrified. The machine also has an annoying habit of questioning if I own the game disc I’ve just inserted into it. And it’s constantly asking me to sign in despite the fact that I never play games online. The Xbox One’s hard disk isn’t nearly big enough, the operating system and the installed games constantly have to update. I still don’t like the feel of the new pad’s triggers. I hate the Xbox One’s dashboard which appears specifically designed to make the console harder to use and to conceal your purchases. Despite these flaws I have had fun with Microsoft’s inelegant block of plastic. I put this down to backwards compatibility and a personal tendency towards masochism. Virtual reality is the only reason I’d also buy a PlayStation 4 but the thought of spending over £500 on a console and headset combination is putting me off the idea. msv858 (Twitter)   E-mail your comments to: gamecentral@ukmetro.co.uk   Preparing to Switch So after much consideration I decided to I wanted to buy a Nintendo Switch at launch. I am 33, have a young family, work, etc. Time is a commodity I really do not have for playing games and I love playing games. I’d find myself getting somewhere deep into a particular game, then I wouldn’t be able to pick up from the last time I played, so I reverted to a game of FIFA or Call Of Duty, etc. So last week I sold the Xbox One; not because it was a bad console, it’s just because I feel the mobility of the Switch will work for me and my life at present. I hope when playing Zelda on Switch I’ll fall in love with gaming again, going to work and being able to play a boss battle on the tram. Heaven. My Xbox One was gathering lots of dust. Anon   Nice package I have had both consoles for both the second and third generation. But I started with the Xbox 360 for the second, then started with the PlayStation 4 for the third. The reason for the choice of the Xbox 360 was my friends had all the same. For the choice of the PlayStation 4 it was the game package. I bought a PlayStation 3 at a later date for the exclusive games, which after the wife bought me a first generation Xbox One is the sole reason that I use my PlayStation 4. I use my Xbox One mainly, as I prefer the style of the gamepad. But also enjoy the exclusive games the PlayStation provides, such as the outstanding Yakuza 0. Gary Humpage   Exclusive party Given that I owned all consoles last generation (and also the one before) I have not switched exactly. However, the Xbox 360 was my main console last generation as it reportedly had the superior third party ports. That meant the Wii and PlayStation 3 were used for exclusives only. This generation Sony and Nintendo still had the exclusives I wanted to play but Microsoft was no longer offering the best third party titles. This coupled with no exciting new exclusives franchises and the established older ones being passed onto new developers left no reason to buy an Xbox One, so I did not. I might consider buying a Scorpio however if it is a noticeable leap over my existing PlayStation 4. Although it looks unlikely that I will be able to justify buying a 4K TV to my wife. And without that any reason to buy a Scorpio is likely to be negated. PazJohnMitch   Catch up on every previous Games Inbox here   Round the houses I’ve switched consoles several times this generation. I had the PlayStation 4 pre-ordered for release day and had that for a while. However, I was hankering after the Xbox One, mainly as I’d been Xbox the whole way through the previous generation (other than borrowing someone’s PlayStation 3 for a couple of months to play everything format specific). I preferred Microsoft but I wasn’t blown away with the Xbox One. After seeing real slowdown in a couple of games, namely Project CARS and The Witcher 3, I decided that I was going to give PC a go instead. I sold both consoles and my iMac and dropped £1,200 on a new PC. That scratched my itch for a while, and I really enjoyed being able to play things with a mouse and keyboard and the cheap PC prices that came with it. I missed having a console, but the PC gaming was good. Then I remembered I had a Wii U under the TV and played a lot of that as well. However, as I’ve got the attention span of a hyperactive toddler, and the fact that the rest of my personal life was tied up in the Apple ecosystem, I went back to a Mac as I couldn’t get on with Windows. I sold the PC and the Wii U to part fund a new 5K iMac and went back to having no console again, but I had a very shiny screen to look at so all was good for a while. However, I decided to get another PlayStation 4 when Uncharted 4 came out and I did just that. I played that happily for a while, but found out that overuse of the controller was giving me problems with my hands. For some reason, the shape of the PlayStation 4 controller disagrees with me and I ended up getting pains in my hands and loss of feeling in my little fingers. So, I packed it all up and went down to GAME and traded the whole lot in for an Xbox One S and I’m happy with that now. The controller suits my hands a lot better and I’m not overly fussed about missing the Sony exclusives, and EA Access is marvellous. Anyway, I guess you could say I’ve switched console a few times. I’m not buying the Switch though, well not straight away anyway.
